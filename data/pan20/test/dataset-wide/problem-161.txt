My vote is going to be Yes, but with a big old asterisk. He could not prevent the war from happening, as the civil war had a lot of causes that I'm not going to go into here (there are numerous documentaries and resources if you are really interested in it). It is highly unlikely that he could resolve all of those problems in such a way that some subset of states would not rebel in a civil war at some time, it is really just a matter of when and how severe it was. However, he could change the nature of the war so that it was no longer considered a civil war. Perhaps he prevents the United States from being formed, and allows the states to exist more like Europe, as a collection of separate nations that sometimes cooperate. In this case, it would be a war between countries, not a civil war. He could also prevent the New World from being discovered for some time, where the later colonization of the New World would result in a massively different landscape where the Civil War could not occur. Using his medical knowledge, he could create the conditions for a terrible plague to sweep through the United States many years prior to the Civil War, which would reduce manpower to the point that a Civil War is not a prospect either the North or South could stomach or effectively fight. He could also generate some sort of "Pearl Harbor" effect, where the US is incited to violence against a common enemy. He could also go back to the first humans, murder them all, and prevent the Human Race from ever evolving. In all of those ways, he is not actually solving the problem of the Civil War or making the world better, per say, but he is technically stopping the Civil War. 

I had some interesting thoughts while walking my dog this morning. Let's assume there has been some catastrophic event that leaves the world habitable, but kills off a large amount of people (99% of the world population) and breaks down governments and global supply chains. All that are left are small groups of survivors that band together and might be the only people for dozens of miles. One of these groups happens upon a subdivision and starts ripping apart houses looking for useful things (let's say they've set up in one of these houses or in a nearby area). My expectation would be that most of the contents of the house would be the first to be pillaged (food, appliances, furniture, etc), followed by the materials that made up the house (drywall, wiring, wood beams that make up the supports and walls), but I can't figure out if the concrete that makes up the foundation and driveways would be useful in any way. Is there any good use that can be made of concrete that would be worth breaking it up and hauling it out? 

I had a handful of great ways for the opening battle of a space opera to go down, but they got totally scrapped when I changed how quickly jumping between star systems worked, and now intra-system travel works. What sort of tactics would the hive mind aliens employ? The System The planetary system is mostly small planets orbiting a dim yellow star. The second planet is inhabited by a fledgling colony, with a partial space station and some communication satellites. This planet is roughly the size of earth, but the remaining planets are much smaller (with the smallest being the size of mercury, and some of the larger almost approaching earth sized). There are three "jump points" located at the edge of the system (around 4 light hours from the star). These jump points are approximately equidistant from each other (or close enough that it can be hand waved). One of these is where the aliens have jumped in from, and another is where a reinforcing human fleet will be jumping in from eventually. Common Technology Both races have the ability to utilize jump points. Jump points are weak points in space that can be used to generate a kind of worm hole that leads to another star system. Speed through these jumps is variable, meaning smaller ships, that normally would travel faster through them, can slow down to arrive with larger ships that are slower. Time between stars is variable, but tends to be in the 20m-3hour range, depending on speed of the ship. Both races have some form of intra-system faster than light travel. The humans refer to it as a Slipstream, a bubble projected around the ship that alters the physical characteristics of space, allowing for rapid acceleration/deceleration and faster top speeds. I've not set hard numbers, but one section has the frigate in system capable of travelling an average of 5x lightspeed, including acceleration/deceleration. This mode of travel is dangerous if disrupted, so it is not used in combat (basically disrupting the Slipstream results in a critical existence failure as real space physics take notice). Human Technology Humans have FTL communication and FTL sensors of an extremely low quality. They can, for example, detect weapons discharges and detect where a ship is in space, but cannot get visuals or any fine detail until light comes in at the normal speed. One ship can relay visuals to other ships in realtime, though. Humans can communicate through jump points via relay buoys positioned at the jump points. Failure of these buoys destroys this ability, and buoys must be present at both ends. Humans have energy shields to protect most of their ships. These shields are effective against most weapons and debris. Humans use artillery or railguns to launch shells into space. The shells then fire off a small booster that further accelerates them to combat speeds and provides some maneuverability. These shells have a variety of payloads (with "space napalm" and shrapnel being popular choices) Humans are physically identical to earth humans. The Aliens The aliens are insectoid and have a mild hive mind that extends over a range of around 2km. Think of this like a distributed computing network. The more there are the smarter they are collectively, and the faster their thought process and reaction time. This is caused by a mild latent psychic field, and does not impact other races. Each individual is capable of independent action, though many follow the collective will of the hive. The aliens utilize energy weapons of an unspecified type (fell free to go wild with this). They have a relatively short effective range, but are very powerful. The aliens do not utilize shield technology, but their hulls are heavily armored. This makes them slower. The fight A Human frigate (30m height x 210m length x 60m width) was orbitting the habitted planet when an alien destroyer (40m x 260m x 80m) jumped in, destroying an engineering vessel at the jump point. The frigate enterred a Slipstream to engage, when two alien light cruisers jumped in (50m x 320m x 90m). Dropping back into realspace, the frigate reversed course and slipstreamed back to the planet, calling for reinforcements. Human reinforcements will arrive at their jump point in around 45 minutes. Aliens have made no move further into the system, and are at their jump point. For these vessels, it would take around 15m to get into combat range of the planet or the frigate. The human frigate's mission is to defend the colony at all cost (but they'd obviously like to survive). The alien's mission is to gather information about the human fighting capability, and wipe out everything in this system, including the comm buoy. The aliens are aware of the possibility of human reinforcements. There are no alien reinforcements available. UPDATES: Human reinforcements are a full defense fleet, so a battleship, multiple heavy cruisers and lots of escorts. If this fleet arrives, the aliens will need to flee or be wiped out In system, humans have this frigate, and a handful of cheap fightercraft that won't do much. The aliens have encountered a few human vessels, and are aware of the fact they have shields. They are not aware of the human reinforcements, or which jump point any reinforcements will come from. In case it wasn't clear above, the aliens do not have FTL sensors in any way. They are entirely reliant on the speed of light for their sensor data. They also do not have FTL communication Alien motivations are decimation. They see this system (and perhaps others) as theirs and they will cleanse it of human presence, with a later goal being colonization. In terms of relative strength, assume that, per normal naval nomenclature, a frigate is a small, fast, lightly armed ship, and each heavier step of ships gets better armed and slower. What tactics would the aliens use? 

An alternative to black blood would be for the flesh itself to turn black because of necrosis (gross link warning). There are a number of bacterium that cause necrosis, and one could be modified for your needs. Since bleeding and other bodily fluid related "treatments" would be common, bacteria could spread quickly. Make the bacteria ravage the skin quickly at a superficial level first (causing the skin necrosis to spread throughout the body first) and only then go on to infect the remaining tissue and organs, and you have a body that is black with necrotic tissue while still alive. Slow-moving necrosis and gangrene were known of during the medieval period (though I am not sure of what extent they were understood), usually associated with open wounds and ulcers and treated by maggots. However, it was likely to be fatal or debilitating, as even as modern as the civil war gangrene was a serious problem. 

Assume I have someone who doesn't age, and has a lot of time to learn any skill or experiment with things, but who was born and raised (prior to becoming ageless) in a medieval farming village. He is of above average intelligence, and, because of his ageless nature, money is hardly an issue (he has mastered enough skills to be able to sell high quality work in a number of fields for significant prices). How would he go about developing firearms from medieval technology (say around 1000-1200 CE)? How advanced could he get with them without basically starting the Industrial Revolution (basically what could he do on his own)? I am particularly inspired by the 1632 series and the French creating rifles using a different chemical compound for percussion caps, but I don't understand most of the chemistry involved. EDIT: In response to comments, let's assume we are looking at a timeframe of between 400-600 years of him being around. What could be accomplish in that time, starting from the tech level of 1000 CE. As for what I mean by advanced, how effective of a weapon could he make? Would he be able to create something like a Sharps rifle? A Springfield? A Gatling Gun? A Repeating Rifle?
