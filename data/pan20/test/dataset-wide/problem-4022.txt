I don't have a proper answer to your main question beyond pointing to the list of equivalent properties in Pesin's book (your first reference), which you've obviously seen already. However, I'll point out that in Ruelle's paper (your third reference), the first main theorem (on page 3), which contains a statement on exponential decay of correlations, is proved under the hypothesis that the unstable manifolds are dense in the attractor. As in Pesin's book, that will imply mixing (on the attractor), so there's no mystery in the coexistence of the result stated by Ruelle and the open problem stated by Pesin. As far as I know the best that you can say in general is that Anosov diffeos are mixing on the non-wandering set, or on the closure of an unstable manifold. So an equivalent question is, "Under what circumstances is every point non-wandering for an Anosov diffeo?" (Or, "Under what circumstances are unstable manifolds dense?") 

Pengfei's answer gives you the general form of the semi-conjugacy $\pi_s$ (basically, the answer is the proof that there is a semi-conjugacy that is 1-1 except at preimages of the endpoints). If you're looking for more detailed information about the structure of $\pi_s$, then it depends on exactly what your goal is, but the most useful thing to have is usually an estimate on the points $\beta_n := \pi_s(0^n 1^\infty)$ -- that is, the points which lie in the first branch of $f$ for $n$ iterates and then are mapped into the endpoint $1$. (This is usually the hard part of the estimates because the map is uniformly expanding everywhere else, which makes life easier.) Many useful estimates on these points can be found in Section 6.2 of Lai-Sang Young, Recurrence times and rates of mixing, Isr. J. Math. 110 (1999), 153-188. In particular, one has $\beta_n \in [(n+1)^{-1/s}, n^{-1/s}]$. You can also derive useful estimates by approximating the first branch of the Manneville-Pomeau map with the time-1 map of the ODE $x' = x^{1+s}$. (If you just want to study a map with an indifferent fixed point, then you can use this as your definition, so there's no approximation required.) This ODE can be explicitly solved by observing that $(x^{-s})' = -s$, and so $x(t) = (x_0^{-s} - st)^{-1/s}$. I'm not sure how feasible it is to write down an explicit expression for the semi-conjugacy, even armed with these estimates, but these give you most of the quantitative tools you need when you're working with the Manneville-Pomeau map. 

The measure $\mu$ is a Gibbs measure if there exists a function $\phi\in C(X)$ and constants $K,P>0$ such that $$ K^{-1} \leq \frac{\mu([x_1\dots x_n])}{e^{-nP + S_n \phi(x)}} \leq K $$ for every $x\in X$ and $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Fact #3. If $\mu$ is a Gibbs measure, then $G_\mu \subset Z_\mu$. That is, the local entropy of a point $x$ with respect to $\mu$ is "what it should be" provided the Birkhoff averages of continuous functions along the orbit of $x$ are "what they should be". (Actually, even more is true: for a Gibbs measure the local entropy $h_\mu(x)$ of any point $x$ is completely determined by the Birkhoff averages $\frac 1n S_n \phi(x)$ of a single function.) 

Dolgopyat and Pesin proved (ETDS 2002) that "every compact manifold of dimension $\geq 2$ admits a Bernoulli diffeomorphism with non-zero Lyapunov exponents". That is, on any such manifold $M$ there is a $C^\infty$ diffeomorphism $f$ that preserves volume $m$ and has the property that $(M,m,f)$ is a measure-preserving transformation that is measure-theoretically isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift. In particular, by the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, $m$-a.e. point $x\in M$ has the property that its orbit equidistributes with respect to $m$, meaning that for every continuous $\phi\colon M\to \mathbb{R}$, we have $\frac 1n \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \phi(f^kx) \to \int \phi\,dm$ as $n\to\infty$. In particular, any such $x$ has a dense orbit. 

Let $X=\{1,\dots,p\}^\mathbb{N}$ be the space of sequences on a finite alphabet with a metric inducing the product topology, and let $\sigma\colon X\to X$ be the shift map. Let $\mu$ be a $\sigma$-invariant Borel probability measure on $X$. A point $x\in X$ is generic for $\mu$ if $\frac 1n S_n\phi(x) \to \int \phi\\,d\mu$ for every $\phi\in C(X)$, where $S_n \phi(x) = \phi(x) + \phi(\sigma x) + \cdots + \phi(\sigma^{n-1}x)$. Denote by $G_\mu$ the set of $\mu$-generic points. Fact #1. If $\mu$ is ergodic, then Birkhoff's ergodic theorem implies that $\mu(G_\mu)=1$. 

In thermodynamic formalism for dynamical systems, a Hölder continuous potential function $\phi$ on a countable state topological Markov chain $(X,\sigma)$ is either positive recurrent, null recurrent, or transient. These correspond to the three possibilities for equilibrium states (shift-invariant measures maximising the quantity $h(\mu) + \int_X \phi\\,d\mu$): existence of a finite equilibrium state is equivalent to positive recurrence; null recurrence is the boundary case where the equilibrium state becomes $\sigma$-finite but not finite, and transience is the case where there is no equilibrium state (all the weight has gone to infinity). These can be characterised in terms of a particular sequence $a_n>0$: positive recurrence is equivalent to $\limsup a_n > 0$, null recurrence is equivalent to $a_n\to 0$ and $\sum a_n=\infty$, and transience is equivalent to $\sum a_n<\infty$. I imagine this trichotomy for sequences appears in other places as well. Edit: It's worth mentioning that this trichotomy is also true for random walks on directed graphs (weighted or unweighted) -- historically I believe this is where it was first studied and where the terminology came from, but as a dynamicist I more immediately think of the interpretation above. In this setting the interpretations are as follows: 

So (C) is equivalent to the existence of an invariant measure. It's not a terribly nice-looking condition, though. At the very least you can probably use this to cover some reasonable classes of examples. 

Given a set X (such as the set of points in an interval), the space ℝX of all real-valued functions on X is not usually the function space we work with -- it is "too large" in some sense. Thus, we typically deal with functions that "behave well" with respect to some other structure on X. One familiar example of this is functional analysis using the Lp spaces: we begin with a measure space (X,μ) and consider two functions to be equivalent if they agree on a set of full μ-measure. Strictly speaking, then, we do not deal with functions themselves, but with equivalence classes of functions. If X carries a topological structure rather than a measure-theoretic one, then we often consider the space C(X) of all continuous functions on X. In this case elements of the space are single functions, and we do not impose any equivalence relation. Of course, there are many discontinuous functions from X to ℝ that may be of interest: characteristic functions of subsets Y ⊂ X, for example, or more general piecewise continuous functions. Thus it would be of interest (to me at least) to have some notion of when two arbitrary functions are "close enough to identical" from a topological point of view, just as agreeing μ-a.e. gives a notion of "close enough to identical" from a measure-theoretic point of view. As an example, if f : [0,1] → ℝ has f(0)=1 and f(x)=0 for all other x, we may reasonably say that the constant function g ≡ 0 is the "continuous version" of f. Similarly, if f : ℝ → ℝ is given by f(x)=1 for x ≥ 0 and f(x)=0 for x<0, while g : ℝ → ℝ is given by g(x)=1 for x>0 and g(x)=0 for x ≤ 0, then we may feel that f and g are "close" to being the same function, perhaps close enough to be identified; furthermore, neither one is "more continuous" than the other, in contrast to the previous example. (They are both more continuous, however, than the function h defined by h(0)=2 and h(x)=f(x)=g(x) for all x ≠ 0.) One possible way to formalise this intuition would be to put a directed graph structure on the space ℝX of real-valued functions on X by drawing an edge from f to g if and only if the graph of g is contained in the closure of the graph of f. Thus in the first example above, there would be an edge from f to g, but not from g to f, while in the second example, there would be edges from h to both f and g, and an edge in both directions between f and g, but no edges from f or g to h. With this digraph structure, continuous functions would have many incoming edges, but no outgoing ones, while "well-behaved" piecewise continuous functions would be partitioned into equivalence classes, each class containing various functions corresponding to the choice for the value of the function at the points of discontinuity. All this is just my own rambling line of thought at this point, and my question is this: Is there a systematic and well-developed theory into which such considerations fit? If so, is there a good reference? I suspect that people have thought about this enough to come up with such a theory, but I have no idea what keywords to look for or what things might be called. (For a similar reason, I wasn't quite sure how to tag this question appropriately, so please feel free to re-tag if you can do better.)
