A short aside: this assumes the white dwarf composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, which is the case for naturally-existing white dwarfs. But what if the "planet" were composed of iron as WhatRoughBeast suggests? The upper limit on the mass of a white dwarf (the Chandrasekhar limit) contains a factor of $\mu_e^{-2}$. The quantity $\mu_e$ is the average atomic mass per electron. For light elements which contain the same number of neutrons and protons, this number is very close to $2$. However, for a heavy element like iron, we have something like $\mu_e=56/26\approx 2.15$, so $M_\text{limit}$ drops from $1.4~M_\text{Sun}$ to $1.2~M_\text{Sun}$. 

Draw: Power Although the burst energy is interesting, there's still a crucial factor missing: we don't know if "recharging" a mage's internal heat reservoir takes seconds or hours. As a rough estimate, the amount of heat generated by the average $70~\text{kg}$ male is around $70-100~\text{W}$. During exercise this can rise to $200~\text{W}$. (Endurance cyclists generate a long-term average of around $185~\text{W}$, while world-class rowers can peak at $3/4~\text{HP}$ of mechanical energy during a $2000~\text{m}$ race, corresponding to a heat output of almost $1.9~\text{kW}$!) Assuming that heat is generated at $150~\text{W}$ while recharging, and that heat loss is roughly proportional to temperature (with standard body temperature corresponding to $100~\text{W}$ of heat output), we get an equation like this: $$ 300~\text{kJ}/\text{K}\times\dot{T} = 150~\text{W}-100~\text{W}\frac{T-25~\text{°C}}{37~\text{°C}-25~\text{°C}} \\ T=(43-14e^{-t/9.9~\text{h}})~\text{°C} \\ t_{T=37~\text{°C}} = 8~\text{hours}~20~\text{minutes} $$ That means that peak burst power represents the better part of a day's reserve, unless your mage takes the time to warm himself by the fire (which can deliver a significant amount of heat). But hold on a second... what if you can augment your internal heat with environmental heat? Unlike for a person generating heat, for a person drawing heat from the surroundings the extremities will be warmest and their core will be coldest. We can approximate the torso as a uniform cylinder and use the steady-state heat equation in cylindrical coordinates: $$ 0=k\nabla^2u+q=k(\frac{u'(r)}{r}+u''(r))+q\\ u(r)-u(0)=\frac{q}{4k}r^2 $$ Assuming that the maximum temperature your mage is willing to stand is around $120~\text{°F}$ ($49~\text{°C}$), the minimum core temperature is the same as before, a torso radius of $14~\text{cm}$, and a conductivity of about $0.5~\text{W}/\text{m}\cdot\text{K}$, the maximum energy draw can be about: $$ \begin{align} q=\frac{4\times 20~\text{°C}\times 0.5~\text{W}/\text{m}\cdot\text{K}}{14~\text{cm}}&\approx 2~\text{W}/\text{L} \\ &\approx 2~\text{W}/\text{kg} \end{align} $$ Add on another $1.4~\text{W}/\text{kg}$ from the body's own heat generation, and account for the $40\%$ efficiency, and you get a total output of: $$ 40\%\times(140~\text{W}+100~\text{W})\approx 100~\text{W} $$ That's not much. Even in this best-case scenario, you could exert more power mechanically. In a more realistic scenario (without absorbing environmental heat) the long-term average output would be in the tens of watts range. Summary Although the body contains a large amount of thermal energy, the body's limited ability to thermoregulate restricts us from drawing lots of power continuously. This form of sympathetic magic should be used more as a tool to precisely deliver small amounts of energy (see Isaac's answer for some good ideas) than to deliver huge amounts of energy (although it is capable of doing so at great cost to the mage).

If you want your reactor to look like the Sun, the simplest design is a flat plate maintained at $5778~\text{K}$, the effective temperature of the Sun. In order to figure out what the efficcency is, we need to know how far away the reactor is going to be. Just for simplicity, let's put it at the distance of the Moon. In fact, let's just put it on the lunar surface, since then we don't have the problem of maintaining this thing in orbit. This will work out pretty well since the Moon is already tidally locked to Earth, and the "lunar day" is about equal to the solar day. From the Moon, the Earth seems to subtend an angle of around $1.9^\circ$. This means that, assuming the plate is an ideal Lambertian radiator the amount of emitted power that lands on the Earth is around: $$ \frac 1\pi\int\cos\theta \sin\theta\ d\theta\ d\phi=\sin^2 r=0.0275\% $$ This means that we need to multiply our power requirements by $3640\times$: $$ P = 6.3\times 10^{20}~\text{W} \\ \dot m = 9400~\text{ton}/\text{s} $$ From the Stefan-Boltzmann law we know that our plate emits: $$ \Phi = \sigma T^4 = 6.3\times 10^7~\text{W}/\text{m}^2 $$ So the surface area of the disk must be at least: $$ A = \frac P \Phi= 1.0\times 10^7~\text{km}^2 $$ For a dimameter of: $$ D = \sqrt{\frac{4A}\pi}=3560~\text{km} $$ The diameter of the Moon is around $3475~\text{km}$, so we need to take up the whole Moon with our emitter. This makes intuitive sense: since the Moon is the same angular diameter as the Sun when viewed from Earth, if they had the same brightness then they would appear equally bright. 

Which is probably more like what you had in mind. However, in order to raise the bridge we have to increase the tension. The numbers we get now are: $$ a = 25~\text{km} \\ \varsigma = 247~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg} \\ \zeta_\text{steel} < 0 $$ The required strength is just about the limiting strength of a steel cable. While a steel cable could support itself, it would do so just barely. Any nick in the cable, or a strong gust of wind, and it would snap. However, Kevlar has 10× the strength-to-weight ratio of steel, and is not an implausible material to use: it's a manmade polymer, and common production processes can spin strands of unlimited length. You could lay the cable in the same manner used to lay the steel cables for the Golden Gate bridge, but spinning the Kevlar strands as you go. $$ \varsigma_\text{Kevlar} = 2514~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg} \\ \zeta_\text{Kevlar} = 51\% $$ With a conservative safety factor, the total weight of the bridge, cars, and passengers/cargo should be no more than that of the cables themselves. I would suggest a thin, aerodynamic, flexible composite shell surrounding the cables and tram cars to keep live loads from the wind low, and to keep the cables spaced correctly. You wouldn't be able to have a hard, rigid deck like modern bridges, so think of it like a high-tech rope bridge. 

All empowered characters must obey the same set of rules regarding the rewind power. Characters must be able to tell when another is using the rewind power against them and counter somehow. ("Going around again? Nice try, but you can't use that trick on me!") However, characters must not be forced to relive a moment more than once if they choose not to exercise their power. (Bonus points: two characters can remain unaware of each other's nature or even existence until they interact.) Unpowered outside observers must not observe any glitches. If you use a branching-timeline model this includes observers in all timelines. If you use a branching-timeline model, at the end of any series of rewinds by both parties there must be only one timeline remaining. 

Idea: the 'battery' takes the form of a metal ingot or bar. To 'discharge' the battery, the user magically induces atoms in the bar to transmute, releasing energy. To charge the battery, one can reverse the transmutation (magically, of course), drawing on an external power source to provide the necessary energy. We can divide such batteries into two types based on the type of reaction they employ:
