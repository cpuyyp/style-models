In the Semitic languages I know about, gender is marked on subject and object verbal markers in the 2nd and 3rd person singular (when/if there is an object marker). Berber and various Chadic languages such as Somali do likewise, so it might be generally true of Afroasiatic. Khoekhoe also somewhat marks subject gender on the verb, though this is connected to movement. 

No, but as contrasted with the related notion of morphological complexity, it seems at least a bit more possible to define and count it. When people say a language has a "rich" morphological system, that usually means that there are very many non-lexical morphemes. It might also mean that there is the possibility of combining affixes, but I don't think that is inherent in the notion of richness. If a language has 200 affixes (a reasonably rich morphology), it would be unusual if e.g. there were 200 cases or mood suffixes, and no other morphemes. Simple counting would be a good measure of "richness". Complexity is much harder to define, since it necessarily involves rules of combination. For example, instead of just saying "the past tense marker is -ile", you might have to say "the past tense marker is -ita after the causative -ʃ and -ile otherwise", which makes the system more complex. The problem is that there is no scientific utility to having a metric of "richness", that is, unlike water which boils when it reaches a specific temperature, languages don't have properties that depend on having a particular quantity of richness. 

"Juncture" is an analytic entity constructed to account for problems in phonemicization, which primarily encodes morphological and syntactic information, often involving syllable structure (syllabification tends to be assigned bottom-up as determined by the morphemic distribution of phonemes -- CV always forms a syllable within a morpheme, C+V or C#V does not always). The underlying premise is that surface phones can be mapped to a subset of such sounds, the phonemes, by eliminating all purely "predictable" sounds. But the fact of there being phonetic differences such as "a name" vs "an aim", or the night-rate / Nye-trait pair, would suggest that English has many more "phonemes" than we want to believe (for example, aspirated and unreleased t would be phonemes, because they both occur in the same surface environment). By positing an entity "juncture" which can be positioned just like any other phoneme, aspiration as a contrastive property of phonemes can be eliminated (and there are a lot of other problems that juncture eliminates). The problem could also be solved by directly referring to morphological or syntactic structure, but at the time (prior to the 60's) this would run afoul of the "single level" theory that prevailed, where phonemic analysis can only consider phonemes, morphophonemic analysis can only consider morphophonemes, morphological analysis can only consider morphemes. There was nothing in the theory that would prevent having "juncture" be the realization of morpheme concatenation, so by translating morphological structure into analogs on the phonemic level, mixing of analytic levels was avoided. This is essentially the driving force behind later (1980's) prosodic theories of the syntax-phonology interface, where rather than letting phonology directly see syntactic structure in determining whether a given rule applies, a phonological analog was constructed (such as "the prosodic word" or "the prosodic phrase"): that way, phonology only refers to phonological things, which are constructed by reference to syntactic things (and similar moves were made for indirectly encoding morphological information). A classic paper using the concept "juncture" is W. Moulton (Language 1947) "Juncture in Modern Standard German"; see also Hockett's 1958 A Course in Modern Linguistics, Lehiste 1960 An Acoustic-Phonetic Study of Internal Open Juncture, and the not totally unrelated 1956 paper by Chomsky, Halle and Lukoff "On Accent and Juncture in English" (not structuralist, though). Scheer A Guide to Morphosyntax-Phonology Interface Theories provides a reasonable overview. Juncture too on a second and more obscure interpretation, as a means of indicating facts of intonation, supplanted by current theories of boundary tones and different kinds of accents. Basically, the reason why you can't find web resources is that the concept has fallen into desuetude in linguistics over the past half century. 

One of the canonical examples of "floating non-tonal feature" is [constricted pharynx] in the article "Emphasis harmony in a Modern Aramaic dialect" (Language 1984: 1-26). There are various analyses of non-tonal phenomena which make the assumption that those feature are "floating", but are equally amenable to a segmental treatment where a specific segment has the feature, and local assimilations apply (an example being Guarani nasalization). There are analyses if vowel harmony in Maltese by Hume and a Palestinian Arabic dialect by Kenstowicz where features ([round], I believe) are set afloat and then reassociate, though I would not presently claim that no alternative is possible without reviewing the article. Another fairly classical case for floating features is rounding in Palatalization in verb inflection in Gurage lagugages. These are all cases where paradigmatic mobility supports the case for floating no-final features, which are maximally like the strong case for autosegmental tone. 

n in English is produced by raising the tongue to contact the palatine process of the maxilla, also by adducting the vocal folds and opening he velopharyngeal port. The exact point of contact on the tongue and on the hard palate is open to some variation, even within one language. Without an audiovisual record, it would be impossible to comment on what you are doing or how canonical a pronunciation of "no" you are producing. 

The Chomsky & Halle 1968 theory is not very clear, in that they predominantly talk of a single matrix containing all features, but there are some anomalous statements that suggest thinking about having two parallel matrices. One of those statements is p. 297 that "the phonetic representation can be thought of formally as a two-dimensional matrix in which the columns stand for consecutive units and the rows stand for individual phonetic features". In light of the fact that diacritics, rules-exceptions and morphosyntactic properties are also features, this segregation of phonetic features at least at the phonetic level suggests that somehow nonphonetic features eventually fall out of the picture, encouraging one to think that they are separate. Same page, they also say "In the case of the phonological matrices...", which would only make sense if there are nonphonological matrices that the phonological matrices are distinguished from. One thing that does not reveal anything about their ideas about matrices is the use of square brackets. As they said above, the phonetic representation is "a two-dimensional matrix in which the columns stand for consecutive units and the rows stand for individual phonetic features". They do not say that the phonetic representation is a vector containing segments and that a segment is a vector containing features. Thus "matrix" in their view is not the same as segment (or boundary). However: in rule-writing, it is standard that [a,b,c] represents a single segment and [a,b,c][d,e,f] is a sequence of two segments, that is, the graphic object square brackets does represent a segment. In light of that, it is impossible to infer anything about the "matrix" status of nonphonological features by inspecting the form of a rule referring to the two kinds of features such as p. 355 (71) [-αsyl,αcons] → φ / __ # [-αsyl,+foreign]: the brackets simply mean "that segment". Section 7 of ch. 8 addresses nonphonetic features. On p. 374 they postulate a convention that "all nonphonological features of a given lexical item are distributed to every unit of this item" ("item" = morpheme, "unit" = boundary, segment). Then continuing, "if a given lexical item is a human noun in the kth declensional class which is an exception to rule n, then the feature specifications [+noun], [+human], [+kth declensional class], [-rule n], now reinterpreted as on a par with phonological features, are assigned to each unit in this lexical item. The problem is understanding the expression "now reinterpreted", which suggests a derivational change, for example "two matrices merge into one" (but unmerge so that nonphonological features aren't present in phonetic representations??). This (merging) is what I think underlies Leben's theory. The bottom line for SPE is that they are not explicit about the 1 vs 2 matrix question, so we really have no idea what they were thinking (nor do we particularly care about their private thoughts). Leben in his dissertation (sect 1.0.2) embraces the idea of multiple matrices: 

There are problems with your experimental set-up, but we can fix that. The first is that what you tell me shouldn't count. I might tend to believe certain specialists who have proven to be credible, but you always have to determine the facts yourself. It might be more surprising to discover a tonal dialect of Dutch (or would have been until such things became widely known) or a non-tonal dialect of Vietnamese, but determining the existence of nature of a tonal system is not dependent on what you were told. A responsible researcher would have a factual basis for rejecting a hypothesis (e.g. that there is tone). I can't tell if you are asking what role expectation has in the conduct of fieldwork – I don't think you are (because that's a question about researcher state of mind, not linguistic fact). However, there might be an interesting experiment to develop along those lines, where you prank a set of field linguists. Give them data from a language (or, fake language synthesized by rule) with, say, 2 levels and 2 contours, and then tell subjects either "This language has no tone", "This language has 2 levels and 2 contours", or "This language has 4 levels and 6 contours": then set them to transcribing. The underlying hypothesis would be that the instructions strongly influence the outcome. The main problem is that there aren't enough reasonably-qualified subjects for such an experiment. The second problem is that "recordings of a few syllables in an unknown language" are scientifically useless and I would even say dangerous. That is not how you go about determining tonal categories in an unknown language (recordings of a few syllables cannot distinguish systematic pattern from random variation). Let's change the context, so that you have a lexicon of a couple hundred citation words, and a sufficient supply of longitudinally-controlled tokens (i.e. not a single reading of a word list in one session). The case where "I didn't tell you which tones were in the language" is the normal case in fieldwork. That lack of knowledge does not mean that you can't distinguish tonal categories; and the fact (and it is a fact) that there is something language specific about the realization of tone does not mean that linguists are incapable of discerning a tonal system on their own. I propose that the question you really want an answer to is "how does one go about figuring out the tonal categories of a language: does the method require certain assumptions of universality?". However, a vague reference to universality really should be replaced with a more specific statement about what the status of the 'universal' is. Naming tendencies might be "universal", in that Mandarin 1st tone is more likely to be called "High" and 3rd tone is more likely to be called "Low" than the reverse; and it is unlikely that 1st tone would be called "Brown" (vs. "Yellow"). But that doesn't tell you about language, that tells you about sound-symbolism. "Universal" is used in many ways in linguistics, so you need to be more specific about ontological status of the "universal" yuo're probing. FYI your question resembles a version of the Hale & Reiss card grammar problem. I disagree with their conclusion, because I don't think that auditory perception is always in terms of phonological features, even when the substance being sensed is linguistic in nature. The specific issue there is whether phonological properties have to be grammatically pre-wired in terms of substance – they seem to say it does, I say it doesn't – it can be learned.
