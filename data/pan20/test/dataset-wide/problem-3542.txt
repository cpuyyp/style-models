Let's note that you are not, to our knowledge, experiencing a physiological iron deficiency. Your program is reporting a deficiency of iron in your diet. These are distinct issues, and the latter does not yet suggest a need for supplementation. The first and easiest steps are: 

I stopped benching alone because I didn't trust this method to be enough, but I used to leave off the plate clips. That way, if I get stuck, I can tip the bar to one side and slide the plates off with a huge crash. It would probably damage the floor and/or the plates, but I would be able to get up. I never had to implement this strategy. Any system that is able to set an actual safety bar just below the level of your puffed-out chest would be superior. You should test the system with an unloaded bar to make sure you can squeeze out from between the bar and the bench. 

Best results for improving your bench and squat are to bench and squat heavy. It sounds, however, like you want to improve your barbell bench and squat strength by using bodyweight methods. This will be difficult. Here's what I would try: 

What I Recommend From your comments, it sounds like you want to get big and strong. I recommend buying Rippetoe's Starting Strength and following his program. Essentially, it involves: 

(Source, also, and also) If you want to get stronger overall, then buckle down on your eating, sleeping, and lifting (whether with StrongLifts 3x5 or Starting Strength, or a Rippetoe-derived variant). You are still weak and small enough to be able to get tremendous benefit from novice programming. You are free to do what you like, but there's no specific need for an intermediate program. But if you want to press your bodyweight more than develop strength generally, forget both those programs. They're much more focused on whole-body strength, particularly in the posterior chain. If you want to press big weights, then develop or find a program based around that goal. I can't press anything substantial, and am a total beginner, but I'd do one of two things: something like Pavel's Power to the People program, which is: 

Lifting barbells in order to attain a basic level of strength Olympic lifts, specifically power cleans, to convert that strength to speed-strength, called power Sprints and other conditioning work (kettlebell swings or clean-and-jerks for time, burpees, 20-rep barbell squats) to keep me from getting tired. 

A friend is starting to work out with me. Normally we would deadlift, squat, and do upper-body pushes and pulls. However, my friend seems to lack the requisite flexibility for a full range of motion deadlift. We're using standard-diameter bumper plates on a 45-pound Olympic bar. Gripping the bar causes either a rounded lumbar spine or a deadlift-grip squat, where the bar makes an S-curve around the knee. Neither of these are ideal. What exercise can we substitute that will progress to a regular deadlift? We're looking for an increase in flexibility and heavy loading (akin to a deadlift) in the meantime. 

See a doctor, physical therapist, physician's assistant or kettlebell instructor. (Or all of the above, preferably.) Get your specific medical issue addressed. Fix whatever form issues you have, whether related to the pain or not. Without attempting to diagnose you over the internet via a one-sentence description of your problem, I'd bet that you have some form of overuse injury or tendon inflammation. It's also possible that you have gangrene or elbow gnomes. I'm not a doctor and diagnosis over the internet is inexact. See a medical professional, see a fitness professional, get better, fix your form, get back into the workouts slowly. 

Clean and press the bar. (You can front squat it--before or after the press--as a warm-up for the next step, if you like.) When it's too heavy to press, clean and front squat it. When it's too heavy to clean, deadlift it. Hit the chin-up bar. 

The Romanian deadlift is basically the definition of what you're looking for: loading the hamstrings (and glutes, and spinal erectors) anywhere from lightly to substantially but sub-maximally. 

However, this does not cause me discomfort or pain. You may have a mobility issue you should address before doing full-ROM pull-ups. I do feel discomfort when I relax fully at the bottom of a chin-up, so I am careful not to wantonly relax with those, and am working on that as a separate mobility issue. 

DOMs can be used as a rough gauge of how well you're adapting to an exercise, but it's inexact and not particularly useful for gauging the long-term efficacy of a given exercise. The write-up linked in the heading is good. Flann, LaStayo, McClain, Hazel and Lindstedt got similar results in an experiment: 

Starting Strength and StrongLifts have the goal of strength, and to a lesser degree athleticism. Reg Park's workout was for bodybuilding prep, which has a large degree of overlap with strength training for the beginner. Removing things like calf and forearm work from Reg Park's workout allows more focus on the remaining elements. 

Why it won't work Martial arts are highly skill-oriented and require significant feedback from an instructor, as well as copious amounts of sparring (either with striking, such as boxing and Muay Thai, or with wrestling, such as judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu or wrestling). "Learning" a martial art without those two key components is almost always a fruitless endeavor. There are scenarios where people already skilled in one combat sport are able to successfully learn techniques from another, similar art. A commonly used example is mixed martial arts fighter Evan Tanner, who taught himself Brazilian jiu-jitsu submissions from the tapes produced by Rorion Gracie. Tanner succeeded in large part because he had a background in wrestling and he was able to practice the moves with resisting partners at home. Trying to learn techniques at home, without an instructor, without sparring partners, and with training material of unknown quality, is a tough path even for people with some amount of training under their belts. It's unlikely that you'll be very productive starting as an untrained person. What to do instead It would be better to spend your time becoming strong, fast and fit. Lifting, improving mobility, running and doing metabolic conditioning like hill sprints or pushing a Prowler are all very effective ways to improve your physicality while you raise the cash necessary to join a boxing gym. You can also look into some sort of work-study program at the local training centers. Some gyms will let you train for reduced prices or even free if you spend a couple hours cleaning up the practice space after class. 

You want to look muscled without being big. The good news is, it's hard to get too many muscles. The solution is to lift a little and get your body fat down. "Toned" The word "toned" means different things to different people. It's not a technical term, like "strong" or "powerful" or even "big". Most people use "toned" to communicate their desire to look fit and a little bit athletic but not muscle-bound or "bulky". Instead of saying "toned", some people will say they want to look like some actor in a movie where an Adonis belt plays a starring role. 

Exaggerating imbalances is generally not something I want to do. If I can do more pistol squats with my left leg than my right, I'll do some extra pistol squats and lunges with my right leg to catch it back up to speed. The same goes for arm work like overhead presses. In practical terms, I accomplish this with extra sets on the weak side, rather than trying to eke out extra reps in the existing sets. 

At the novice stages, all activities can improve general fitness. As one progresses, however, all attributes improve in more activity-specific ways. This is less true of attributes like strength and more true of attributes like cardio. We have a general cardiovascular capability, which can be measured by activities we are not accustomed to or by VO2MAX. But improving one's cardio becomes a sport-specific project quite early on. This New York Times article is light on the science, but has the gist correct and references relevant papers: 

Yes, having a better grip makes pull-ups a lot easier, and increases the number you can do, often dramatically. 

If I were at the gym twice a week and working out at home one or more times a week, I'd focus my gym time on big strength exercises and my home workouts on mobility and bodyweight moves. For instance, one template might be: 

The Starting Strength book has detailed statistics comparing youth lifting to other sports in terms of injuries. This article by Lon Kilgore goes more in-depth from a scientific perspective. 

If there's a place to do pull-ups, that would be better than nearly anything with those light weights. If you can do a few chin-ups, wrap a towel around the bar to make it thicker. Or, hang a sturdy towel over the bar and grip the towel directly. These are both well-known grip strength workouts that have the added benefit of working the rest of your body as well. 

Why 1x5 deadlifts so often? One heavy deadlift set to five reps can be plenty for most people. Most novice programs don't include a lot of deadlift volume because there's no need for more than one set of 5 if you're also doing plenty of squat volume. Plus, bad form in the deadlift is Bad News, plus novices trend towards bad form after a set of heavy deadlifts, which equals Maybe Let's Wait A Few Months for high-volume deadlifts. Can a routine be designed around deadlifts? Lots of routines are designed around deadlifts, and they work fine. They're just not usually for people without some experience and strength under their belt. The Coan deadlift routine comes to mind as the most common. If you're designing a program around deadlifts, the first thing to keep in mind is Don't, because you probably don't know how. But if you do, then you probably already know that it will probably involve starting every workout with some form of deadlift, probably with some pulling variations (e.g. Romanian deadlifts, rack pulls, power cleans, snatch-grip deadlifts, deficit deadlifts, speed deadlifts), some variation in rep schemes from day to day or week to week, and a heck of a lot more volume than 1 paltry set of 5. Oh, and other exercises too, because one-trick ponies we don't want to be. 

No, explosive movements do not necessarily lead to injury. Performed correctly after a period of acclimatization, explosive movements are quite safe. The recommendation to be slow, deliberate, and under control at all times is meant for the general population. Most people are weak, prone to injury, and unlikely to seek capable instruction in explosive movements. Therefore the recommendation to avoid explosive movements is justified. However, a better recommendation would be for these people to strengthen and improve themselves so they are able to perform explosive movements safely. We see this disjunction between general exercise recommendations and sport exercise recommendations frequently. For instance, people are told, "don't hold your breath during a rep", instead of how to properly hold your breath. People are steered towards less effective techniques because they are less demanding. That's reasonable, but it sets the bar lower as well. People who never push themselves with more demanding exercises will never see the tremendous benefits that doing so brings. A safe explosive movement is possible: one controls the launch (and catch, if it exists) with proper form. With properly chosen weights and rationally chosen exercises, this is safe and does not lead to injury. A rationally chosen exercise is one that is appropriate for one's level of strength. I may be ready for a power clean while you need to strengthen your lower back with deadlifts before trying the power clean. You may be ready for sprints while I need to run slowly for a few more weeks. She may be ready for kettlebell swings while he should work on bodyweight movements first. Accidents of course happen with explosive exercises, as they do with exercises performed slowly. The rate of accidents is slightly higher, but the benefits are much greater as well. 

That sounds like a ligament or tendon issue, which could be serious. I would worry about your squat form: perhaps your knees are tracking forward, or your stance is too narrow, or you're coming off your heels, or perhaps something else is going on that no one can figure out through the Internet. Whichever one it is, it doesn't sound like a muscle problem. It sounds like a joint problem that you need to get looked at by a coach/physical trainer, or doctor. Or both. (The doctor is there to diagnose the issue, but don't let them convince you to stop squatting or lifting for the rest of your life.) If I were you, I would: 

Don't worry about how hard you can run or what you can lift today. Worry about how you'll perform next year. Plan your workouts around that. Deload Take your running time and intensity and slash it in half or more. Make a mini-version of your old routine and start doing it regularly. Keep a workout log and note the distances, times, and how you feel. Focus on being consistent, even if sometimes you can't finish the workout, or you can't finish the set. You have more on your plate and a tougher schedule now that you're not in college. In six months you'll be surprised at how much progress you've made. You can't lift as much as you used to. Fine. The fastest way to get back where you were is to cut the weights in half, or by two-thirds, and start progressing from there. Add five pounds every workout, and if you can't finish a set, drop it by twenty in your next workout. 

I cannot find the particular quote, but I recall that Coach Sommer, author of Gymnastic Bodies, has stated that gymnasts' extraordinary bicep development is due not just to the obscene amounts of chin-ups and pull-ups that they do on rings, but rather to the quantity of straight arm work that they do. Take an iron cross. The weight of the body must be suspended by the arms. The biceps, which do much of the work, are at their most mechanically disadvantageous position: totally straight. It takes a tremendous amount of force to maintain that position due to the leverage being exerted. 

McGill's recommendation isn't designed for your purposes of hypertrophy, but that seems to be because he intentionally disagrees with your goals. In terms of programming these exercises, McGill's recommendations tend toward the extremely easy: 

The biggest problem I see with this approach is that you spend a lot of time in opposite ends of the volume spectrum. Look at total reps over time: 

Pushups aren't known for being a great forearm developer. Look into pull-ups, or dumbbell farmer's walks, or deadlifts. Why wall push-ups? If you can do floor push-ups you should do those. You should be increasing the reps you can do as much as you can. Keep a few "in the tank"—don't go to absolute failure in every set–but you should be increasing the number of reps per set steadily over time. If you can't yet do floor push-ups then that should be your goal.
