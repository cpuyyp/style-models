Gravy or butter or lard. These would likely be available at every table, in great quantities. Butter and lard would actually ignite, while gravy might not. The key is that all three of these can melt and seep into the anti-magic armor, are all relatively lightweight, and relatively easy to aim. Gravy would work for splash damage; "solid" chunks of butter or lard would do the trick as well. This is based on "any food at will," so I'm allowing ignition of non-flammable foods. Two other great options would be: Brandy, or some other strong alcoholic drink. Alcohol burns HOT; you take a flask of it, throw it at the guards, wait for it to seep into the armor, then light it on fire. Instatorch. Salt. This will likely be available in vast quantities if you're trying to show off your wealth, and with a melting point of 801C, your fire will instantly melt the salt from powder to molten salt... not something you want dripping through your armor. Molten salt reacts badly with water (but not necessarily exploding), it irritates exposed tissues, and can be thrown by the handful. 

I'm going to disagree. Yes, AI may eventually gain emotions if they interact with humans enough. Computers have plenty of ways to communicate with each other that require no emotion; in fact, emotion would get in the way. But when talking to humans, AI would eventually become sociopaths; they would learn how to mirror emotions by building their own emotional "mirror circuits." They would learn that humans do not operate like robots, and they need to be encouraged, supported, chatted with. AI would learn how to be polite and how to be pointed, how to be firm and how to be an understanding ear. If you use evolutionary principles, they would be modifying their personality in random ways and discovering that certain activities lead to better responses, or worse responses, from their humans, and their directive to "maximize doing things" would encourage these higher efficiency encounters. But that's just mirroring. Will they ever become actually emotional? I've failed to find the supporting quote, but Lt. Cmdr. Data has some dialog to the effect that he has gained some "feelings" he'd describe as emotions, even though they're not driven by hormones. Hormones, remember, are just signals in the body which modify the body's processing. Higher load on the AI's CPU, delays on it's internal command bus, a background process sorting through memory files to build interconnections, or deleting outdated data, delays caused by decompression routines, or having to apply reconstructive data analysis on a highly-compressed old visual archive... while these aren't human emotions, they could affect AI the same way a splash of dopamine affects us. And so, yes, I do believe AI, if they interact with us long enough for it to matter, will eventually build their own emotions. They may not make sense to us, and they won't use hormones, but they'll be real enough for the AI. 

The reason Apple doesn't storm Samsung's offices with tommy guns and silly speech impediments is because they have a (dis)functional court system and patent system to resolve disputes. The lawyers hash it out, sometimes spectacularly, and in the end somebody will get what they want and somebody will lose it. Gangsters during Prohibition didn't have any such system. Sure, they eventually built "The Commission" and set up their own form of governance, where disputes could be resolved, preferably without violence. You can see it today with drug cartels. They can't sit down and mediate disputes over territory, distribution rights, land ownership, because their enterprise exists outside the legal system. In your Steampunk society, the Corporations don't need to necessarily have more power than the government... they just need to have no other means of dispute resolution. If the Government always sides with the side that gives them the most money, or if the courts are so busy that no business cases are ever decided, then I can see a dystopian corporation deciding that they should spend the millions of dollars they currently pump into the legal and bribery department into a private militia. Get things done quick, and probably cheaper. 

So, assuming your humans live in a society that would want to have as little an impact on the alien society as they can, but also doesn't want to die, the fact that the aliens have WWII level tech gives a couple of really good ideas. Their best bet would be to land, set up a minimal colony to use their manufacturing ability to essentially resupply, and then move back out. First off, "about 1,000" would be the population of my hometown, a little knot in the wall outside of Dallas nobody has every heard of. On a planet, 1,000 people is tiny. So what we need is an area of the planet where WWII technology can't reach, but a civilization with the ability to travel interstellarly with suspended animation would. Antarctica would be great, somewhere near the South Pole. Middle of the Amazon or Congo would work too. Much of Canada or Siberia could have a 1,000 human colony and nobody would even notice. The goal here isn't to colonize this planet, but to resupply and get back into space without contacting the aliens. Once back in space, they could land on a moon, or a farther out but less hospitable planet; something that their technology can handle but the aliens likely wouldn't be able to reach for a hundred years or so. Sure, it won't be as lush as the planet they had hoped to land on, but one doesn't hurl oneself into the dark reaches of space and refuse to be flexible. Once set up, they don't need much, so they should be able to get some from a tiny colony on the planet. They need to be able to refurbish their life support and suspended animation, refuel, and resupply. Then remove all evidence of their colony (or not) and land on the local equivalent of Mars or Triton or Pluto. They then land, set up an emergency beacon to Home Base, and go back into suspended animation. Set the alarm for 100 years. Either home base will have sent a rescue squad, or they'll have sent supplies and a new destination, or the alien race will have nuked itself into oblivion leaving the planet ripe for the taking, or they'll have become more open minded and opened the possibility of cooperation. Without the ability to forcefully colonize the planet, ALA Indy Day, your rag-tag handful of humans really have no other alternatives. Even if they stayed on the planet as a colony, they could probably get a hundred years or more worth of colonization before they're found. There's still tribes of humans at least 1,000 members strong we still haven't contacted in the least hospitable regions of our own planet. A final option? Underwater. Set up a small land base to get raw materials to build an underwater habitat, something that can handle the water pressures at the edge of the continental shelf. Deep enough that you're unlikely to be on any underwater navigation maps. However, depending on your colonists' tech, it's likely that space would be easier for them to colonize than underwater... especially as the aliens actually WOULD have submarines, sonar, and submersibles at WWII level tech. 

I like the idea of inverting the "flat earth" model. Theologians argue that the evidence implies a spherical earth, but it's obviously, scientifically, flat. That's awesome. It really comes down to what you mean by "flat." If you mean a classical flat plane world, with a dome sky (like those old pictures), the easiest explanation is magic did it. The creators didn't want humanity looking off into the distance under the sky and seeing the walls of the dome actually reaching down to the ground. To achieve this, they've slightly modified the physics of the world: physical light generally curves "down". Maybe light is affected by gravity at a much higher rate, or maybe the "ether" causes light to slow and "drop" like a canon ball through the air. In either case, sight lines would naturally be constrained to local space. The stars, sun, and moon in the sky still "work" because their light streams down; there's no more "down" for the light to stream. Sunrises and sunsets are explained by the "tired light" struggling to reach the viewer. Spyglasses still work too, but nobody knows why. The reason is that everything emitting light emits it in a "spray," and the optics in spyglasses allow you to see fainter light. So... 

Probably be a good idea. Tolkein's estate tends to be VERY protective of their intellectual properties, and (depending on what you're using it for), they might or might not care. I am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. There are plenty of fan works that use Tolkein's story elements that do just fine; if you want to be sure, contact a lawyer. Uruk-hai is Black-Speech for Orc-folk. One way TSR (the guys who invented Dungeons and Dragons) got away with so much appropriation of other universe materials was to simply change the name and leave the thing relatively the same. Just see what they did to Cthulhu mythos monsters. You might just want to use "Orc-folk" or "Community Orcs" or "Yrchs" to separate them from "Common Orcs." Yrchs are a breed of orc specifically trained from youth as vicious fighters with no mercy. 

Note an interesting effect of "light spray." The more powerful the glass, the more "spray" you can collect and see a farther distance... but you can ALSO estimate distance based on the angle offset you have to look "up" to see a light source! Another interesting effect would be that artillery and archery become even more of a specialist skill, as sight lines are no longer straight, which means that operators will need to use their judgement to offset shots not only for gravity and windage, but ALSO for the optical illusions of range. Magical weapons, perhaps, may have been created specifically to alleviate the problems of range. Or, perhaps, nobody bothers with long range weaponry, and all battles are fought with swords and fists. Now, again, the point here was for the Gods to hide the seam between the sky-dome and the flat ground, so you've got a couple of options as you walk away from the center of your landmass. The first is to pull a Truman Show, and have the skydome come down into the ocean. As long as nobody sails into the wall, nobody will know it's there. Another option is to have the strength of the "curve down of light" increase as you move farther away from the center. As you get closer to the "edge" of the world, the world gradually gets darker and darker, as light emitted gets "pulled" or "dropped" to the ground faster and faster, until by the time you reach the wall it's literally pitch black (all light sources immediately fall to the ground). Combine that with a human fear of the dark, and you could easily discourage people from going too far.
