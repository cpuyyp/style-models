The 600,000 figure seems to have come from "Worldwide burden of disease from exposure to second-hand smoke: a retrospective analysis of data from 192 countries" by Mattias Öberg and others published in The Lancet, Volume 377, Issue 9760, Pages 139 - 146, 8 January 2011 and online 26 November 2010, which said "603 000 deaths were attributable to second-hand smoke in 2004." It also said 

One of the slashdot comments points to a NASA article originally from 1997 which tells you not to hold your breath and then says in summary, 

It seems clear that "Hispanically Speaking News" has misunderstood, and that McDonalds's closed in Bolivia in 2002. The 2011 film's title ¿Por que quebró McDonald’s en Bolivia? is clearly in the past tense, and a note of the film from November 2011 in GlobalPost states clearly "after five years, McDonald's closed its eight branches and left the country in 2002". The BBC Mundo review in Spanish mentions the date, but the Institute for Economic Affairs comment on the BBC (in English) does not and this may have confused Hispanically Speaking News. The clearest evidence that this story is about 2002 comes when Hispanically Speaking News said on December 22, 2011 

and a long list of other things. So it would be difficult for anybody to claim that it promotes weight loss in itself, especially after ephedrine related substances were removed from products. Safety is a much harder issue, and there have been persisent allegations that taking Herbalife is associated with liver problems. But even here there are correlation/causation issues. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition scientific committee looking at "hepatoxicity associated with consumption of certain food supplements" said: 

The chart chooses just the lowest number. The chart considers the foundation programme to be starting work rather than training and the university degree to be training. The source consistently calls the foundation programme training. 

It is likely that they did a simple projection of the current trends into the future to make this prediction. On the regular census that the New Zealand Government runs, they ask each citizen what their religious affiliation is. Here are the results for the last four censuses. 

I haven't yet been able to find whether the authors included this in their calculations or whether they used the same footprint per kilogram of meat as was used for human consumption. If the claim about meat-based pet food being primarily made up of off-cuts that would be otherwise burned is true, and the authors didn't include this in their calculations, the carbon footprint of meat-eating pets would be significantly smaller than the book claims. Phys.org also expresses some skepticism: 

While I haven't addressed every claim and every paper your article contains, the small part I did examine shows that your article does not do a good job of correctly reporting the results of the studies. 

When a result is not significant, it is not significant. We can't use an insignificant result to make the claim that the "advice resulted on a 22% death increase". We also can't say that it "bordered on statistical significance" without further evidence that it actually did. We certainly can't predict the future outcome of a trial without actually conducting the trial. If we could, we would be even have trials? A couple of paragraphs from Reflections on the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) illustrate some of the problems with trials of this sort that lead to insignificant data. In the past, fibre has been seen as having a protective effect rather than the detrimental effect your article is claiming. 

There is an anti-Clinton site claiming to be the Clinton Memorial Library (the real library site is very different) which says 

Global warming, by definition, means higher temperatures on average. Since warmer winters are described as "milder" the answer is yes, on average winters are milder in a warmer world. That does not preclude cold winters in many years or in many places. But the changes year to year are volatile compared with the overall rise in temperatures, even when averaged over half the globe. See these charts from Wood for Trees for northern hemisphere temperature anomalies, taken from the Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit data series. The red line is for (I think) January anomalies and the green line for July anomalies. The trend from the 1970s to the 1990s is fairly clear. 

These are extreme views. There is no scientific consensus for runaway climate change or that climate change will cause the human population to fall to 1 billion by 2100 (the United Nations recently projected 11 billion $URL$ Nor is the map particularly credible - the range of temperatures between currently habitable zones within that red area is already much wider than 5 degrees (think of the Tibetan plateau for example). And despite the crude line through Paris (the east coasts of North America and Asia are generally cooler than the west coasts of Europe and North America at the same latitude, for reasons associated with wind and the Earth's rotation), something more complicated has been drawn in the southern hemisphere, with an incredible treatment of northern Australia (currently largely hot desert) 

The sources appear to be these for train driver and hospital doctor. Neither of the source documents are specific to London, these are for hospital doctors and generic train drivers across the entire United Kingdom, not specifically London Tube drivers or London doctors. NHS employees in inner London get 20% extra pay up to a maximum of £6,342. Outer London NHS employees get 15% extra. The chart says the "starting salary" for a doctor is £22,636 but the source says this salary is for a "junior hospital trainee". Immediately after that figure it says: 

The chart states a value for a salary at five years but this information is not included in the source. The value £45,000 does not appear in the source. The average of the specialty doctor range listed above is around £53k however it should be noted that we don't know the actual distribution within this range. On a different page from the same site regarding GPs, the salary range is listed as between £55,412 and £83,617. The hours on that page are listed as 50. 

As you can see, the answer "No religion" is trending upwards at around 10% per decade. Christianity is trending downwards at about the same rate. The total of the categories "No religion", "Object to answering" and "Not stated" is at around 50% of the population in New Zealand. Christianity makes up about 43% of the total population in New Zealand. If the rates stay constant, we would expect that after 36 years, the percentage of Christians in New Zealand will have dropped by 36% which would leave 8% of the population left as Christians. The same would be true for the No Religion group in the reverse direction, going up by 36% to 74%. The percentage of non-Christian religions has been growing over the last four censuses, however the rate of change is smaller than the other two groups. At about 2% per decade, by 2050 they would make up 13% of the population, outnumbering Christians. From this simple projection, they along with the "Object to answering" and "Not stated" groups would make up the remainder of the population. This is a simple projection from existing trends and is not highly likely to be precisely correct however it does suggest that the prediction of less than 10% religious by 2050 is close to what we should expect. 

No, the 40% figure is not true. These figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the US Department of Commerce suggest that in each year over the last decade the finance and insurance industry made up about 7.2%-8.4% of GDP ("value added" is the technical term) and 4.5% of employment. Widening this to finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing gives between 19%-22% of GDP and about 6% of employment. More tables here if anyone is interested. 

Ronald Reagan did sign a law in 1967, namely the Lanterman–Petris–Short Act, which reduced the ability of the state to institutionalise mentally ill people involuntarily. It had the causal consequence of increasing the number living on the streets. It was not Reagan's proposal, so it is difficult to blame him for this law; since it was seen as increasing the civil rights of mentally ill people, it is difficult to blame him for not vetoing it. A bigger question is whether there was sufficient out-patient care and hostel housing provided to meet the resulting demand. But even if there had been, there would probably have been an increase in homelessness. 

Assuming there was no response bias (optimistic but difficult to reject) and that the population of both adults and children are approximately 50:50 male:female (reasonable), then that would suggest that, weighted by victims, roughly 57% of cases were male-on-female, 23% male-on-male, 16% female-on-male, and 4% female-on-female. Those numbers do not look implausible to me, though other studies would undoubtedly produce different proportions. The next stage is harder. Two further assumptions are needed, neither of which I think are obviously reasonable: the first is that different types of abusers have the same average number of victims; the second is whether it is meaningful to describe those who abuse children as being heterosexual or homosexual, as it may depend on whether you see sexual abuse as being related to sexual attraction or not. If you are prepared to make both those assumptions, then you could draw the conclusion that most child sexual abuse is by male heterosexuals, followed by male homosexuals, but when taking account of their prevalence in the population, a disproportional number of cases come from male homosexuals. Women are less likely to commit child sexual abuse (though they appear more in other non-sexual cases of child abuse and neglect). There have also been cultural changes, which in the UK date to the early to mid 1980s, where campaigns for gay rights switched emphasis away from seeking abolition of legal ages of consent to seeking equality of ages of consent. This was early in the rise of HIV/AIDS when it became clear that sexual liberation could have unexpected negative consequences, and also when other social liberals made it clear that what appeared to be a fetish for youth on the gay scene was not acceptable social behaviour in wider society. Even by the 1990s there were vestiges of this remaining as seen in the response to a Stonewall concert.
