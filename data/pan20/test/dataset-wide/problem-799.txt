Technically, yes, the moon does have an atmosphere that gets ionized by the sun. NASA: Is There an Atmosphere on the Moon? 

Yes. That's why we called the CMB isotropic until a decade or two ago; isotropic meaning 'the same in every direction'. Since that time we've had the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, and its successors which show slight differences in it depending on where we point our antenna. We can easily measure our velocity with respect to this nearly uniform background radiation: Speeding through the universe. Subtracting that, we get Speed corrected WMAP data showing hot and cold spots. That's why we now call the CMB anisotropic. 

So, whether by ionic or fluorescent emission, the moon's atmosphere does glow. Unless one wants to argue about the glow not being restricted to the poles by a magnetic field, or airglow, that glow counts as an aurora. 

If you've moved to an area with major aircraft traffic, you may be seeing fewer stars due to cirrus cloud formation. Such clouds are often subtle enough not to be visible as clouds but still block out starlight. For example: Forecasting Andean rainfall and crop yield from the influence of El Niño on Pleiades visibility 

If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion. Hadley cells are patterns of warm air rising in the tropics, flowing north, and sinking at higher latitudes. The Earth's rotation causes this north-south flow to curve, causing storms to have that distinctive spin you see in in hurricanes. Alternatively, if you are an exceptionally long pendulum, you'd try to oscillate in the same plane. However, the Earth's rotation would make that plane appearto rotate with respect to the surface of the Earth. Called a Foucault pendulum, it was the first proof the Earth rotates visible from the surface. 

Probably not. You'd need a could of gas dense enough to contract under its own gravity. In the space between galaxies, matter is spread too thin for a solar-system sized cloud to exist. A much larger cloud could be more diffuse and still collapse, but being much larger, it would collapse into a galaxy. Even within a galaxy, stars seem to form when shock waves from nova or some other event initiates the gravitational collapse. 

Gamma ray bursts are thought to emerge from the poles of supernova, so a star's spin axis would have to be in the right direction for it to hit us. Betelgeuse, a nearby supernova candidate has it's spin axis at an inclination of about 20° to the direction of Earth, so that star is not likely to get us when she blows. However, we don't have accurate information on the direction of the spin axis of most stars. 

Your radio information source is wrong. The Large Hadron Collider has not discovered mini black holes. When it comes back on line this spring, the LHC will begin looking for mini black holes: Large Hadron Collider Could Prove the Existence of Star Trek's Parallel Universe Journalists do like their headlines, but the gist is this: 

According to this table, Hubble is good down to around magnitude 31.5. What with digital stacking of exposures, that number has got to reflect a point at which detector noise is equal to incoming signal. At the distance of M31, 778000pc, that brightness corresponds to an absolute magnitude of M = 31.5 -5((log778000)-1) = 7. That's about as bright as Epsilon Indus, a K3 class star, 0.45 to 0.8 times the mass of the Sun. If Hubble is seeing that deep, it's a little surprising how few stars it picked up in that image of our neighboring galaxy. 

Asking what they would do if they existed and if they had capabilities is really the realm of science fiction. There can be no good answer to your question at this time. Maybe later we'll know, maybe never. 

Kepler did know the orbital period of the Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. He had access to observations going back centuries, including Brahe's most excellent data. What couldn't know was the absolute size of the Earth's orbit, so the best he could do was give the size of the plantets' orbits in terms of the Earth-Sun distance, 1 A.U. Nobody else could do better for centuries. Using the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, timing the instant the edge of Venus "touches" the edge of the Sun from two different locations on Earth a known distance apart makes a parallax measurable, and the absolute distance between the Earth and Venus a matter of trigonometry. Kepler's Law lets us convert all the other relative distances into absolute distances. I believe it was 1769 when this was first accomplished. 

Although sources go way back, the current best estimate seems to be that of Abdul Ahad from March 2004: 

It's cold out by Saturn, which reduces the tendency of gases to evaporate off into space. Black body temperature of solar system objects: 

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is still up there. At a compact 2000kg, it's likely too small to see via earth based telescope. Mission Page I think the Chinese orbiter is back on earth now, but there may be others. 

It's poetically called The Old Moon in the New Moon's Arms. Project Earthshine used measurements of the brightness of the non-sunlit portion of the moon to accurately determine earth's albedo: 

Pretty thin soup. Sodium and potassium get kicked up by photons hitting the surface. There's also argon, helium and other minor components. As shown in this figure from the first link: The sodium in that atmosphere does glow; (Rayleigh unit definition). At least some of the glow is due to full fledged ions rather than charge-neutral fluorescence: 

Stereo Vision? Optically, you'll need something like a couple big Fisheye lenses mounted on a helmet. Looking straight through such optics yields horrible distortion, so you'd have to feed the lens' output into CCD/CMOS sensors, and massage that into flattened images your eyes can handle, on a video screen. Perhaps Google Cardboard? Probably doable and light enough to wear. A straight optical approach to correcting the fisheyes would probably end up too heavy to lift. 

Yes. By looking at a nearby object that hasn't been subject to erosion and has been subject to the same position around the sun, you could estimate the distribution of impacts on the Earth in time and in size. The moon is excellent for this purpose. Here's an article touching on the subject: $URL$ 

"What happened before the Big Bang" is like asking what Alexander the Great's phone number was. It's a nonsensical question. Space and time began with the Big Bang. "When" and "where" began with the Big Bang. 

"Life" seems to be an emergent phenomenon, a complex result of a very large number of simple parts or interactions. The whole is more than the sum of it's parts, unpredicted by the properties of the individual parts. If those individual parts are atoms and molecules, they have to move to be able to interact, to build larger, more complex structures. To move, they need to be suspended in something that permits movement and allows chemical reactions. On Earth, that would be liquid water. Other liquids might work, but they'd need to allow for the movement and reactions life requires. It's hard to imagine something other than a liquid doing the job. 

From the above, climate is obviously also a variable in star visibility. Added: Oh yes, aging is also a factor. The eyes opacify with age: 

How thick is the line? An extended finger is about 30 arcminutes across, the size of the moon, but a line is a line, 0 arcminutes. The Hubble Deepfield, as mentioned by Kilfiger, is only 2.5 arcminutes across, 1/12th of a finger-width, yet contains hundreds of galaxies. If you want to be a stickler for true lines, the image does contain dark space too. At a guess, there's not easily accessible software for counting such things, it looks like 70-80% blackness (ignoring obvious stars), so 1 chance in 5 your line is pointing at a galaxy. 

IEEE Spectrum recently ran a piece on detecting exoplanets: DIY Exoplanet Detector - You don’t need a high-powered telescope to spot the signature of an alien world 

Jupiter is highly dynamic: Jupiter Animated Video Gallery (be sure to look at storm merger video) Differences Spotted in Jupiter's Big Red Storms Jupiter's New Red Spot Jupiter Loses Big Belt; Great Spot Left Hanging The persistence of Jupiter's Red spot is in fact a bit of a mystery. 

As explained in this article, as the CMB is created from a vaiable (matter?) density $\kappa$ its gradient $\nabla \kappa = \vec{u}$ can be separated into a gradient and curl part, called the $E$ and $B$ modes $$ \nabla^2 \kappa^E = \nabla \cdot \vec{u} $$ and $$ \nabla^2 \kappa^B = \nabla \times \vec{u} $$ Thinking about electromagnetism, these definitions look slightly (but not exactly) familiar, if the vector $\vec{u}$ would take the role of the electromagnetic potential $\vec{A}$. Is the similarity to the terminology of electromagnetism just a coincidence, or do these $E$ and $B$ modes have indeed something to do with electric and magnetic fields ? 

Why (from a physical point of view) are slow-roll inflation models no longer considered to be realistic, what are their disadvantages? What can models that explain (the end of) the early inflation by a tunneling transition between to vacua explain or describe, that slow roll models can not do? 

However, as I have heard such slow-roll models are no longer deemed realistic today in inflationary cosmology, instead other models where the end of the inflation is explained by quantum tunneling of the universe from a state with higher vacuum energy density to another state with lower vacuum energy density are considered for example. 

There are really only six ways you could heat the interior of a planet. Gravitational collapse and compression, fission, fusion, crystallization, a very large impactor, and tidal flexing. Fusion is out because Earth would be a rock-star. (Been waiting to use that one.) Of the remaining possibilities, nuclear fission explains the majority of Earth's current temperature gradient. $URL$ 

There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object. So yes, you can be still with respect to one object, but you'll be moving with respect to every other object. As for using it as a form of travel, letting your destination come to you, well, there's no difference between that and simply moving toward your destination other than the way you phrase it. 

Time does not pass slower near a black hole. Stay-Home-Sally far from a black hole observing Astro-Bob descending into a black hole would see Bob's time passing slower as Bob neared the event horizon, but Bob would not experience this. On the contrary, Bob, looking back at Sally, would see time pass faster for her as he neared the event horizon. Who is right, or is time relative to the motion of the observers? 

To see the milky way, you need merely go out at night somewhere where there is a dark, clear sky. In northern hemisphere fall and winter, you'll also be able to see the nearest large galaxy, M31. The large and small Magellanic clouds, visibly grace southern skies. If you live in a city, a cloudy, hazy or very humid region, you're out of luck, unless you can get out into unspoiled countryside. Modern digital cameras are far more sensitive than the human eye. 

Reasonably current data puts the current closest brown dwarf at 6.5LY (2 parsec) and less than 0.08 solar masses. A nearer one could show up, but it's not looking likely. 

Naturally the more abundant smaller asteroids collide more frequently. In fact Hubble seems to have caught the aftermath of such an event back in 2010. To answer the question. It seems Ceres will remain intact for some millions of years to come. But it does get hit fairly regularly, like the moon. If Ceres regularly took impacts large enough to preclude habitation, we'd expect to see co-orbiting debris clouds like the Veritas cluster, or in the 2010 Hubble images. We do not see such debris clouds near Ceres.
