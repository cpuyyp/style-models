Since this is the Earth Science stack exchange I assume you are talking about the Earth's exosphere, in which case the first issue to decide is how one defines the exosphere - there are several definitions. The lower boundary is straight forward - the thermosphere. However, the exosphere doesn't have a clearly defined upper boundary. You could argue that any gas molecule that is gravitationally bound to Earth is within the exosphere, but that depends upon the relative forces of solar wind and gravity, which is a variable. Some argue that the outer limit is defined by the geocorona at about 10,000 km, whereas the gravitational limit is more than 100,000 km, or arguably up to half the distance to the moon. The exosphere's composition varies from oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium at its base, to just hydrogen and helium in the outer limits. The exosphere's pressure is about 0.0007 atmospheres at its base to virtually nothing in the outer reaches. In fact 'pressure' is a meaningless concept in the outer exosphere because individual atoms and molecules are kilometers to hundreds of kilometers apart, so they almost never interact - and pressure is really the intensity of molecular physical interaction. A comparable argument applies to the exosphere's temperature. In the outer regions of the exosphere the same hydrogen molecule could have a daytime temperature of nearly 2000 Kelvin, and a night-time temperature close to zero Kelvin. In both cases the space would feel cold because there is next to nothing there to transmit heat. The Earth's atmosphere is still evolving by processes dominated by the lithosphere / biosphere. Only hydrogen and helium are light enough to shoot up to the top of the atmosphere (think helium weather balloons). At the height and temperature of the thermosphere, or higher, they can both gain sufficient thermal kinetic energy from sunlight to gain escape velocity, which is why there is very little helium or free hydrogen in our atmosphere. 

There is a sea-surface thermal front at the northwest tip of Scotland. On the western side is water from the Gulf Stream Drift - cool, but sufficiently comfortable to swim in. On the north side is Arctic water which is horribly cold and which nobody in their right mind would swim in. I write from personal experience! 

There is overlap of course, but >90% of most geology courses deal with topics which don't come into physical geography, such as geochemistry, geophysics, petrology and mineralogy, hydrogeology, economic geology,and palaeontology. Some 'Earth Sciences' courses are wider in scope, encompassing meteorology, oceanography and climatology - all of which have differing degrees of overlap with physical geography. Sedimentology and plate tectonics are generally thought of as geological topics. I wouldn't include these as 'physical geography', but others might. The topic of physical geography has also changed in scope over the years, now being heavily linked to the nature and practice of 'geographic information systems', and 'remote sensing'. Again there is overlap, but geology is still a distinct range of topics which is separate, complementary to, and much greater than physical geography in scope. 

From the dips it is obvious that the stratigraphic structure is a syncline, in which case you correctly deduce that the youngest layered rock is the mudstone. But look carefully. The dips on either side of the fold axis are more than at right angles to each other, indicating an open fold of about a 110 degree deformation. Now consider the basalt dykes: basalt is normally intruded as sheets along planar fractures. It is obvious that these dykes have not been deformed, or they would be curved. Therefore they are post-deformational, and are therefore the youngest rocks on the map. 

A) Some would argue that the Holocene is over, and we are now entering the 'Anthropocene', a new era hugely impacted by human activities. Another view is that the Holocene will be over when the polar (including Greenland) ice reaches a new equilibrium state - which is not in the foreseeable future. Technically there is no way to predict the 'official' end of the Holocene. B) Major glaciations are somewhat infrequent in the history of planet Earth. There have only been about 7 +/-1 glaciations, depending upon how you define 'major'. The current glaciation is about over, and human induced global warming will see to it that we are not just entering a mere inter-glacial interlude. On top of human induced global warming there is another very long-term global warming caused by the sun's changing radiance. Since the mid pre-Cambrian the sun's composition has changed from less hydrogen to more helium, which has increased the sun's energy output by about 20 to 25%. This change will continue at a slow but accelerating rate, such that the the planet is getting progressively warmer, and we will never again see another major glaciation on planet Earth. 

No context is given, but at face value this is a meaningless quotation. Globally there is a net increase in arable land from close to zero about 8000 years ago, to the current maximum of just over 40% of the gross biological productivity of the planet. 'Arable land loss' can refer to the land lost to urbanization, salinization or desertification. One might also make a distinction about agricultural land lost to hydrologic intervention, as in the decreasing flows of the Amu Darya, and Sur Darya in Central Asia. In addition, over the coming decades we will begin to see agricultural land lost to climate change impacts. No single assessment of the 'historical rate' of arable land loss is meaningful. One has to evaluate the various processes separately, and then aggregate them at regional level. 

About four kilometers, see, for example: $URL$ But bear in mind that much of the oceans, especially in the southern hemisphere, have scarcely been mapped at all, so it is currently impossible to give an accurate estimate. 

I've never heard of the 'Mulligan river', and neither, apparently has Google Earth, (apart from the Australian Mulligan). However, there are some obvious features of the Sebaskatchu River on Google Earth that one might note. As background, 11,000 years ago the Earth was just beginning to emerge from the last ice age, so ice cover was very much greater, and sea level was very much lower, so I assume that the +135 metre lake level to which you refer is relative to today's sea level, consisting of a temporary glacially dammed lake level. These ancient lake shore lines are a common feature of glaciated terrain, as may be seen in Alaska, Scotland, Norway and New Zealand. All lakes are relatively short-lived in geological terms, being effectively sediment traps. Sediment accumulation in the lower Sebaskatchu river basin has been intense, and has all but filled the entire lower basin. This is most obvious from the extreme river meandering, which occurs only wherever there is a high sediment load combined with a low hydraulic gradient. There are two phases of sediment fill - a general fill over a large area, and a specific small lake fill which you can see about 6 km (as the crow flies) from the river mouth, and for about 8 km further upstream. You may note that none of the lower basin drainage is guided by the bedrock, whereas the upper basin, presumably above your threshold of +135m, is of a different style, This upper drainage is partly guided by the underlying rock structure, i.e. along strike, and partly by a cross-cutting component. The latter is most likely 'superimposed drainage', which has cut down through ice and glacial drift into the bedrock. 

You are not alone. Allmost everyone has difficulty differentiating Ac from Sc because, apart from the obvious low clouds, you can't accurately discern a cloud's height purely from looking at it. For that you need a 'ceilometer', which is a vertical beam of light reflected off the cloud-base. Not many met sites have this. 

Of course atmospheric-ocean-coupled global climate models are, by their nature, very strong on ocean-atmosphere interaction, but what about large lakes? Lake Victoria in East Africa, the N American Great Lakes, and Lake Nasser, and maybe some others are of comparable size to the average grid cell size of the AO-GCM. Hence wind, humidity and evaporation should affect adjacent grid cells. Is this taken into account? 

The classic text has long been "Karst Hydrology and Physical Speleology" by Alfred Bogli, - which I highly recommend. Karstic dissolution and precipitation (to form stalactites, helictites, etc.) are basically hydrologic processes in which groundwater seeks to attain thermodynamic equilibrium with the carbonate rocks with which it is in contact. Water flows downhill towards the base-level of erosion - generally sea level. But bear in mind that during the last glaciation sea level was about -120 metres compared to modern sea level. To get very high mountain karst the system has to develop and then be lofted by other tectonic processes of uplift. In the Jebel Akhdar of Oman there are caves up to about 2 km elevation, but I guess that some limestone massifs have been elevated higher than that. 

Zoom in for the clues. The lines are not radiating out from the village, but from the cattle kraals. These kraals are irregular enclosures built of acacia thorn, agave and other thorny bushes. The cattle are kept in these kraals at night to protect them from hyenas and packs of wild dogs. The cattle themselves are likely African longhorn or various local cross-breeds with Sebu. They are creatures of habit, walking out from the kraal in the early morning, and back in the evening. They follow the same track for several hundred metres before the cattle diverge in slightly different directions. In the more concentrated paths decades of hoof-prints erode the dusty soil, often in trenches to depths of 60 or 70 cm. When it rains, runoff drains into the paths where it collects as red mud, the latter being derived from the deep weathering of basalt. The cattle are led by villagers who each have allocated pasture land, hence the constancy of direction. This is the most striking example I have seen. Often it is not as obvious because, at least in wetter areas, there is more local grass, and the cattle are tempted to disperse 'closer to home'. On the ground one can see these in many parts of East Africa, from the Simian highlands of Ethiopia to the Simiyu pastures of northern Tanzania. 

I think you need some statistics to bolster your argument. It could be that there aren't so many big cities in America's 'tornado alloy', so the footprint of a super-cell storm has a low probability of crossing tall buildings. Check out tornado alley on Google Earth. There are still unanswered questions, such as why some supercell's develop tornados, whilst others do not. Also, the question of the mechanism by which tornados dissipate their energy has not been entirely sorted out. One can say, however, that tornado development requires two conditions: strong thermal convection, and little or no low-level wind shear - such as might occur around large buildings. So the optimum conditions for tornado development are large flat open plains in which warm and cold fronts are converging. 

Most meteorites are darker than this specimen, having a characteristic ablation texture on the unfractured surfaces. Admittedly, this specimen is weathered, which could lighten the surface appearance, but it has such a heterogenous texture, including non-spherical vugs, that it looks to me to be more volcanic than meteoritic in origin. The fact that it is strongly ferromagnetic, and smelling of sulphur, leads me to suspect that it might even be slag from an iron foundry - it has the right kind of internal texture. There are strongly magnetic meteorites, largely made of Ni-Fe alloy, but they definitely do not have such a porous texture, are not sulfurous, and would weather to a more reddish colour (from haemetite). I do not believe that this is as hard as diamond, which makes me doubt your quartz-dealers credentials! Summary: either artificial slag or a bit of weathered lava. BTW: I don't know where 'ghost' is from, but if you ever get the chance to visit Vienna, I strongly recommend the meteorite galleries in their natural history museum - probably the world's best collection of meteorite specimens, of all varieties. Spend a day there, and you will definitely have your eye trained to spot real meteorites.
