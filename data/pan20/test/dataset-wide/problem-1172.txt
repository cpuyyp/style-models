You have maintenance plans. Try to follow these steps: Find the maintenance plan name and id that you want to delete. Write down the id of the one you want to delete. 

Well...We solved the problem. There was an Update, inside the procedure running that "select * from...". I commented the update. no more problems. 

is High Availability something to describe Log Shipping and Always On ( replica )? is Always on something to describe Log Shipping and High Availability? I'm studying to get my certification 40-762 but I need to study a lot about these topics ( since i'm bad in this part on online tests ). But even looking at Microsoft's website I'm confused about these topics. I know something about log shipping and replica, But I would like a point to study, and looking for "always on" and "high availability" not knowing what they are is a bit hard. So, how can I describe them? 

Maybe this question is confusing to understand ( as I'm not fluent in English ) but, I need to select for example, but this needs to have the following rule: Part 1: it needs to be ALL cods, except for . Part2: Another column, with another , but only with cod 21. it's not the entire query, But after this, I think I can do it. I tried this: 

Maybe this question is a little off topic, I will close if necessary, but, is there a way to configure Management studio, to when I open it, it starts already with x connections? So I don't need to start it and connect to x instances every time. 

According to one of the Microsoft's support pages, there is this query to show if there are gaps between logs. there are none: 

If you execute this from and using the flag to supress headers, and flag to redirect output to a file, it will build a script that can then be executed directly. 

The first name is the table name and the second name is the column name. You can use '%' as a wild card if you don't know the exact name you are looking for. 

Sybase ASE retrieves port numbers for the listeners from the file. On *nix systems, this is typically in the Sybase Home directory ($SYBASE/interfaces) On Windows systems it's called and can be found in %SYBASE%, which is likely to be c:\sybase (I think..been a while since I've run on Windows). I believe you can launch the GUI interfaces editor through Sybase Central, if you are using that to manage your ASE databases. and are the two utilities that can be used to edit the interfaces file. You can also manually edit the interfaces file using a text editor such as but be sure to pay attention to the format of the entries and permissions, so as not to accidentally muck it up. 

The transaction log can be dumped indedpendantly of the database using the BACKUP LOG command: Backing Up the Transaction Log (full and bulk-logged recovery models) 

Sybase ASE does not support a direct upgrade from version 11.5 to version 15, so you will have to export your database from the ASE 11.5, and import it to ASE 15. From the $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/scripts/ directory in your ASE 15 installation, run the installupgrade file into your ASE 11.5 installation, to install some utility stored procedures to assist with the migration. 

In ASE, a cluster is multiple physical Database Servers working as a single logical Database Server. There is no separate designation if a Database Server (single or cluster) is running multiple databases, since that is the expected operation. Database is the collection of related objects (Tables, views, triggers, users, etc). Schemas: In ASE a user can own objects, and set permissions on those objects independently, which satisfies some of the same use cases for schemas BUT a user can not be dropped from the database if they own any objects. So for practical purposes, most sites don't use user level objects. The lowest granularity storage object in ASE is a (other databases call this a ) the size of which is set when the server is installed, but can be 2k, 4k, 8k or 16k. This means that the database allocates pages in chunks equivalent to the page size setting. Referential integrity can cross database (schema) boundaries. I highly recommend checking out sypron.nl. Rob Verschoor is an SAP VP & Engineer and his site is packed with good information, tips, tricks and scripts. His quick reference books are also VERY good, and I would recommend them to anyone needing to work with ASE, Replication Server or IQ. 

inserts into an table that already exists. put data in a table that you will create in the same action ( whitout the need to create column by column. You should use something like this: 

How can I make the second column ('0.995014168') To have more decimals? I'm trying to convert to , even using with no success. 

I could fix this by running the query pointing to a driver inside the server I'm running. How can I give permissions to a SQL Login/User to a network folder? Should I map the driver first and then run it? Like the tip they have in this site: $URL$ I'm trying it right now. Question: Is my BCP running under SQL Service Account ? or it's using the -U -P account? 

About recovery modes, I know that if you want point in time recovery, we should use FULL recovery mode. if this is not necessary, you can use SIMPLE recovery mode. But, I read about Simple recovery mode, and it says that we should use this if point in time recovery is not important . Here we don't need LOG backups, we only use , and I thought that should be good for performance and disk space to use Simple recovery databases. But As I said, we don't have static data. there's a lot of insert, updates and development updates ( yes I don't understand why they don't need point in time recovery , but, anyway...). My question is, is still a good Idea to use simple recovery, or by not having static data, the log will still grow, and etc? 

Whats happening is, the primary backup job is running fine ( there is a lot more history, im just showing the last 2 ). 

It seems that the 5GB limit is per server, so you would not be able to have multiple 5GB databases. As for migration, it should be just a matter of shutting down the Express Edition, and using the Developer Edition binaries to start your existing data server. It may be as easy as copying then RUN_[servername] file from the old directory to the new one, if all of your system and user databases exist outside of the installation directory. The link above is worth checking out, as it details the restrictions of the different versions. It's also a great resource for ASE knowledge, as Rob Verschoor is one of the most knowledgable Sybase/SAP database guys around. 

SAP/Sybase ASE uses a slightly different conceptual model than PostgreSQL, Oracle & SQLServer, which all have the concept of a schema. 

Databases will typically issue a checkpoint prior to dumping the data to ensure all commits are written to storage. The checkpoint can cause the database to truncate the transaction log, depending on database settings. According to Microsoft, the following conditions will automatically trigger log truncation: 

You should probably create a .sql script that can run and return the value for multiple commands. A script can be easily created using the following format: 

Now login to each database, and run the sp_checkreswords command to make sure none of your DDL is using words reserved for the system. If reserved words are found, you will need to alter the code, and remove/change the reserved words. Use the ddlgen utility to export your full database structure (Tables, indexes, stored procedures, defaults, user defined datatypes, etc.) At this time, you may want to review the code generated by ddlgen, to make sure it makes sense in your new environment. You may want to make changes to device locations, device names and device sizes. For example, ASE versions prior to 12.5 had a device size max of 2 Gb, so if your database was 10 Gb, you were forced to have 5 devices. ASE 15 will allow device sizes of up to 1 Tb (on a server with a 2k page size), so you would only need one device to store the entire database. You may also want to seperate the index and trigger creation scripts from the rest of the DDL, to allow you to run those independantly. This comes in handy when you import data into the new server. Once you are satisfied with the scripts, you can run them against the new server, and it will create all of your database structure on the new server. At this point it's a matter of transitioning the database, using the bcp utility, you will need to export your data on a Table by Table basis. Depending on the size of your databases, and the number of tables in each database, this can take a while. I would recommend trying the -n (native) version of bcp instead of the -c (character) if it's possible. To import the data into your new database, you will also want to use the bcp utility, but you will likely want to make sure that your databases do not have triggers or indexes as this will enable the 'unlogged' version of bcp to run, allowing it to run faster and not fill the transaction log as it runs. If you can not run the unlogged bcp then you will want to make sure you have the appropriate database options ('truncate log on checkpoint', 'abort tran on log full') and set the batch size for your import to a reasonable value. At this point, you can create in indexes and triggers (if they haven't been created up to this point), and start testing the server. I would also recommend reviewing Sybase's Migration Guide, as it will likely go more in depth, and cover things I may have forgotten/skipped over. A lot of the details will depend on the migration environement, so planning and preparation are key.
