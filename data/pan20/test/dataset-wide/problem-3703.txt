Finally, one can try to represent noncommutative rings by sheaves on Rings with respect to some subcanonical Grothendieck topology that extends the Zariski topology. This also fails, as described in the paper 

Any morphism of $R$-algebras $\varphi : R\{t\} \to R[t]$ is determined up to homotopy by an element of $\pi_0(R[t]) \approx \pi_0(R)[t]$. If $\varphi$ is an equivalence, then this element must be the generator $t$, so we may as well assume $\varphi$ is the canonical map $\varepsilon_R : R\{t\} \to R[t]$. Claim: Let $R$ be an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum. Then the map $\varepsilon_R$ is invertible if and only if $R$ is a $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra. Useful observations: 1) The map $\varepsilon_R$ is compatible with extensions of scalars. Therefore if $\varepsilon_R$ is invertible, then $\varepsilon_{R'}$ is invertible for any $R$-algebra $R'$. 2) $R$ is a $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra if and only if $\pi_0(R)$ is a $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra (see comments). Sufficiency: Suppose that $R$ is a $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra. The map $\varepsilon_R$ is obtained by extension of scalars along the connective cover $R_{\ge 0} \to R$, so we may assume $R$ is connective. The $\infty$-category of connective $E_\infty$-algebras over $\mathbf{Q}$ is equivalent to that of simplicial commutative $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras. Under this equivalence, the map $\varepsilon_R$ corresponds to the identity morphism $R[t] \to R[t]$ (where by abuse of notation $R$ also denotes the corresponding simplicial commutative $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra). Necessity: Suppose $\varepsilon_R$ is an equivalence. Since the map $\varepsilon_R$ is compatible with formation of connective covers, we may replace $R$ by its connective cover. We may also extend scalars along $R \to \pi_0(R)$ to assume $R$ is discrete. Consider any residue field $R \to k$. If $k$ is of characteristic $p>0$, then $\varepsilon_k$ cannot be invertible. Indeed, it is well-known that $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{F}_p}$ is not invertible, and $\varepsilon_k$ is the extension of scalars along the faithfully flat map $\mathbf{F}_p\{t\} \to k\{t\}$. Thus every residue field $k$ must be of characteristic zero, so $R$ is a $\mathbf{Q}$-algebra. 

As Tyler pointed out, it is "too easy" to be representable in the non-connective world. This might sound good, but it comes at the cost of geometric intuition. It is related to the fact that negative homotopy groups of the cotangent complex arise from "stacky" phenomena, while in the non-connective setting it will be impossible to distinguish what comes from stackiness and what comes from non-connectiveness of the rings themselves. I will try to give an example of this below. 1) First, a slight reformulation of Tyler's example (just to show that this is a very general phenomenon). Let $X = Spec(A)$ be an affine scheme and $U \subset X$ a quasi-compact open subscheme. Lemma: When considered as a nonconnective spectral scheme, $U$ is affine. Proof: $U$ can be written as the vanishing locus of some perfect complex $F \in Perf(X)$. In other words, as a non-connective spectral stack, the functor of points of $U$ is as follows: a $T$-point $T \to U$ is a $T$-point $x : T \to X$ such that $x^*(F) = 0$. According to Prop. 1.2.10.1 in Toën–Vezzosi's HAG II, there exists a canonical epimorphism $A \to B$ of non-connective $E_\infty$-ring spectra such that $Spec(B)$ has the functor of points described. (This $B$ is discrete if and only if $U$ is actually affine as a classical scheme.) 2) Let $X$ be a (connective) spectral scheme and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-algebra. Consider the relative Zariski spectrum, the (connective) spectral stack $Spec_X(\mathcal{A})$ whose space of $T$-points is $Maps_{\mathcal{O}_T\text{-alg}}(x^*(\mathcal{A}), \mathcal{O}_T)$, for any $X$-scheme $x : T \to X$. In particular you can take $\mathcal{A} = Sym_{\mathcal{O}_X}(F)$ for any perfect complex $F$; let $V_X(F) := Spec_X(Sym_{\mathcal{O}_X}(F))$ denote the "generalized vector bundle" associated to $F$. One can compute (see Theorem 5.2 in Antieau-Gepner) the relative cotangent complex of $V_X(F)$ at any point $s : T \to V_X(F)$, for an $X$-scheme $x : T \to X$, as $x^*(F)$. You can read off a lot of information about $V_X(F)$ from the cotangent complex. Namely, say $F$ is of tor-amplitude $[a,b]$ (I'm going to use homological grading). If $a \ge 0$, i.e. $F$ is of non-negative tor-amplitude (hence connective), then $V_X(F)$ is representable by a (connective) spectral scheme (which is affine over $X$): by Zariski descent, you can assume $X$ is affine, and then $V_X(F) = Spec(\Gamma(X, Sym_{\mathcal{O}_X}(F)))$. If $a \le 0$, then $V_X(F)$ is a spectral $(-a)$-Artin stack (this is what I meant about the cotangent complex controlling "stackiness"). If further $b \le 0$ then $V_X(F)$ is smooth. That was the connective story. In the non-connective world, $V_X(F)$ will "automatically" become representable by a non-connective spectral scheme even when $F$ is non-connective. In other words, by passing to the non-connective world, we allowed ourselves to replace stacks by "schemes", but on the other hand we lost something significant: it is not clear anymore what information we can read from the cotangent complex about the geometry of the "scheme". 

A student of Orlov is working on one case. He will give a talk in two weeks in Padova, here is the abstract: 

This is not really an answer to your question, just an attempt to address your question from the comments. There are various flavours of homotopical or higher algebraic geometry that are commonly considered, which have different levels of connectivity, linearity, or strictness of commutativity. These include: 1) simplicial commutative rings 2) connective $E_\infty$-algebras over $H\mathbf{Z}$ 3) connective $E_\infty$-ring spectra 4) (nonconnective) $E_\infty$-algebras over $H\mathbf{Z}$ 5) (nonconnective) $E_\infty$-ring spectra In characteristic zero, one also considers (connective) commutative dg-algebras. The flavour most suited for algebraic geometry purposes is (1): this is the minimal extension of algebraic geometry where derived tensor products and cotangent complexes live. This was the flavour originally studied by Lurie in his thesis, and Toen-Vezzosi in HAG II. Any of the other theories might be called "spectral algebraic geometry". (2) is similar to (1), but is less suited for algebraic geometry purposes, because deformation theory in the $E_\infty$-world is different than in the setting of simplicial commutative rings. In fact, the affine line is not even smooth in the $E_\infty$-world. The difference between (2) and (3), as between (4) and (5), is linearity: in (3) and (5), you only consider objects which are linear over the sphere spectrum, so these settings are well suited to purposes of stable homotopy theory. The main difference between the connective and nonconnective settings is the lack of converging Postnikov towers. That is, every connective $E_\infty$-ring spectrum $R$ can be written as a homotopy limit of square zero extensions of $\pi_0(R)$. This allows one to establish analogues of many results from classical algebraic geometry, by using induction along square zero extensions. The nonconnective world, on the other hand, behaves much differently, and geometric intuition very often fails. I don't know much stable homotopy theory, but I believe the main point of spectral algebraic geometry is to be able to consider $E_\infty$-ring spectra as affine schemes, and to apply algebro-geometric techniques to study them. For example, the main application so far is Lurie's construction of tmf, the spectrum of topological modular forms, as the global sections of a sheaf of $E_\infty$-ring spectra on the moduli stack of spectral elliptic curves. 

More generally one has the following statement: if $u : C \to D$ is a quasi-fully faithful functor of dg-categories, then the induced morphism of mapping spaces in the model category of dg-categories (with the Dwyer-Kan model structure) $$ Map(E, C) \to Map(E, D) $$ induces an injection $\pi_0$ and an isomorphism on $\pi_{i > 0}$. (Note that the set of morphisms $[C,D]$ in $Ho(dg-cat)$ is the same as $\pi_0 Map(C, D)$.) This follows directly from the characterization of quasi-fully faithful functors as the homotopy monomorphisms in the model category of dg-categories (see Lemma 2.4 in Derived Morita theory). 

The exact sequence of triangulated categories $$ Perf(X)\to D^b_{coh}(X)\to D_{sg}(X) $$ may be lifted to an exact sequence of stable $\infty$-categories or dg-categories in the sense of BGT: choose an enhancement of $D^b_{coh}(X)$, take the induced enhancement on the subcategory $Perf(X)$, and define $D_{sg}(X)$ to be the cofibre of the inclusion in the $\infty$-category of small stable $\infty$-categories. Algebraic K-theory can be defined at the level of stable $\infty$-categories, and it is an additive invariant in the sense of BGT (see Prop. 7.10 of loc. cit.); this means that it sends split exact sequences to (co)fibre sequences of spectra. Its nonconnective version $\mathbb{K}$ has the stronger property of being a localizing invariant, which means that it sends arbitrary exact sequences to cofibre sequences of spectra. Hence applying nonconnective K-theory to the exact sequence above, one gets a (co)fibre sequence of nonconnective K-theory spectra $$ \mathbb{K}(Perf(X))\to \mathbb{K}(D^b_{coh}(X))\to \mathbb{K}(D_{sg}(X)). $$ The first term is identified with the Bass-Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory of $X$, and the second is nonconnective G-theory (nonconnective K-theory of the abelian category of coherent sheaves). These agree with their connective versions on nonnegative homotopy groups, so the induced long exact sequence on homotopy groups gives what you are looking for. 

I have just discovered a chart comparing topologies on Sch/S, made by Pieter Belmans. It includes all the topologies discussed above, and some more I haven't even heard of. It's even interactive and includes definitions and other information. 

For the second question, it sounds like you have the right idea already. For the first, one way to view the situation is as follows. In the case where $T$ commutes with colimits, so that the arrow you label $\tilde{T}$ is invertible, it is straightforward to see that the colimit of $D$ is given by $(T\colim(X), \colim(Y), f)$ where $f$ is the arrow identified with $\colim(\kappa)$ up to the isomorphism $\tilde{T}$. Then in the general case, one can think of this pushout as a correction for $\tilde{T}$ not being invertible. In other words, $f$ is the "closest approximation" to $\colim(\kappa)$ in some precise sense, being by definition the co-base change of $\colim(\kappa)$ along $\tilde{T}$. (Co-base change is just another word for the arrow obtained by pushing out.) Of course the precise sense I refer to is just the universal property of pushouts. Just for completeness, let me sketch the case where $T$ commutes with colimits. One way (maybe not the easiest one) is to use the identification of the comma category $T\downarrow C$ with the fibred product $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} T\downarrow C @>>> C^{[1]} \\ @VVV @VV{(s,t)}V \\ C\times C @>>{T \times id}> C\times C \end{CD}$$ where $C^{[1]}$ is the category of arrows in $C$ and $(s,t)$ are the source and target maps. This follows from the description of diagrams in $T\downarrow C$ given in the statement of your first question, for example. Hence it is sufficient to understand colimits in categories of the form $A\times_C B$. There are various ways to do this, when the functors $A \to C$ and $B \to C$ commute with colimits (which they do in our situation when $T$ does). For example, consider the global colimit functor $$ \colim : \underline{Hom}(I, A\times_C B) \to A \times_C B $$ where $\underline{Hom}$ is the internal hom in Cat. By the assumption one sees that this is identified with the functor on $$ \underline{Hom}(I, A) \times_{\underline{Hom}(I, C)} \underline{Hom}(I, B) $$ induced by the global colimit functors in $A$, $B$ and $C$. The original claim then follows by a direct computation. 

Sketch of a proof I learned from Peter Scholze that in modern language a proof can be given, after identifying Quillen K-theory with the K-theory of the stable infinity-category of perfect complexes, by using the following characterization of extendibility of perfect complexes: a perfect complex on an open subscheme $U \subset X$ can be extended up to quasi-isomorphism to a perfect complex on $X$, if and only if its class in $K_0(U)$ lies in the image of $K_0(X)$. This kind of thing is discussed in 

In the framework of $\infty$-categories, I think it is not difficult to see that your claim for $\mathcal{A} = \Delta^1$ holds for all $\infty$-groupoids. Let $K$ be an $\infty$-groupoid (Kan complex) and $C$ an $\infty$-category (weak Kan complex). The canonical map $C \to N h C$ is an isofibration (or fibration in the Joyal model structure), where $h$ is the homotopy category functor, left adjoint to the nerve functor $N$. This implies that 1) the induced map $$ \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, C) \longrightarrow \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, NhC) \times_{NhC} C $$ is a trivial Kan fibration, and 2) the canonical map $$ \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, NhC) \times_{NhC} C \longrightarrow \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, NhC) $$ induces a full, conservative, bijective-on-objects functor on the homotopy categories. Since $K$ is a Kan complex, one can prove that $$ N \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{Cat}}(hK, hC) = \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(NhK, NhC) \longrightarrow \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, NhC) $$ is a trivial Kan fibration. Now after passing to homotopy categories one gets a full and conservative functor $$ h\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(K, C) \longrightarrow \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{Cat}}(hK, hC). $$ I am not sure whether the assumption on $K$ Is really necessary. 

There are plenty of interesting dg-categories one can associate to a scheme. From the point of view of six functor yoga, these should be viewed as "categories of coefficients" for cohomology theories. For example, the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves (or its various variants) is the category of coefficients for coherent cohomology, just as the derived category of $\ell$-adic sheaves is the category of coefficients for $\ell$-adic cohomology, or motivic complexes are the coefficients for motivic cohomology. These have been studied for decades using the language of triangulated categories, but it is well-known that they can each be defined as dg-categories. As the base varies, they form stacks of dg-categories with good descent properties (depending on the category of coefficients). In fact, in each of these examples, there is much more structure: there is a whole six functor formalism, categorifying the standard features of cohomology theories, like Künneth formulas, Poincaré duality, Gysin maps, etc. The six functor formalisms also lift to the dg-level. For any given category of coefficients you might be interested in, there are certainly plenty of references, though most of them will be written in the language of triangulated categories. You shouldn't be bothered by this: there is a very large amount of interesting algebraic geometry you can do in this language, and anyway the arguments can be translated to more modern language without changing very much how they look. On the other hand, if you are specifically interested in seeing the power of the modern language, one important point is the failure of descent at the triangulated level. The book of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum is a great place to see descent arguments in practice. Another very good reference is the work of Bhatt-Scholze. I should note that both these references actually use the language of $(\infty,1)$-categories instead of dg-categories. In fact, Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum's definition of dg-category is just a $k$-linear stable $(\infty,1)$-category. If you work in the $(\infty,1)$-category of dg-categories, you don't see any difference between this and the classical definition. If you do want to work more set-theoretically, you will have to pay for the psychological comfort by doing a lot of extra work to make sure the constructions you do are homotopically meaningful (e.g. whenever you take a tensor product or internal hom). If that's your preference, then I would suggest papers of Kuznetsov, Lunts and Orlov (which definitely contain a lot of interesting and beautiful mathematics).
