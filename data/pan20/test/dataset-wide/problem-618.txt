I'm torn here between attempting to answer this question, and voting to close it on the grounds that you'll only ever get an opinion-based answer. But, to give the benefit of the doubt.... For the first part of your question, I'd say it was unlikely, but your pertinent words are "using a motor". He may well have cheated using other means, in particular the blood doping for which he is now infamous. This is largely because I think the answer to the second part of your qurstion is "no". I think that in 1999, battery technology was sufficiently primitive that it would have been impossible to conceal a motor, or that a motor that was concealable would deliver such negligible power as to be ineffective when it comes to increasing your speed. I mean, this is arguable even with 2016 technology - have a look at the size of a bettery on one of today's e-bikes, and you'll see why I say this. I think you only have to look at mobile (cell) phones of the day to convince yourself of the limits of the technology. My gut feel is that any film you watched which showed motors was using lots of artistic license - if it contained a pile of syringes, I'd be a lot more convinced. 

There are many good replies here. Read them a few times and consider carefully what everyone is saying. Based on my experience-- I totally lacked any fitness when I began to ride again as a middle-aged adult-- the hill you're trying to ride is a little ambitious, if you're carrying a few extra pounds and your fitness has not been developed sufficiently. However, as everyone has indicated, it totally do-able, given enough time and effort. And you're not riding some vintage road bike with a 42/26 lowest gear (which clocks in at 42 gear-inches, about twice as much as your actual lowest gear, which comes in at 19.9 gear-inches). I have a couple of similar climbs near where I live (both about 0.4 miles, one with an average grade of 3%, and one with an average grade of 8%), and when I first started riding, I could just make the 3% grade, using the lowest gear on my vintage mountain bike (very similar to what your bike has), and it was a good long while before I attempted the 8% grade. On one of my first attempts of the 8% grade, I was passed on the way up by a female jogger, and she must have noticed how hard I was breathing, because I was really laboring. But over time, I kept riding, and now it's not that much of a big deal to do the 8% grade. So, keep riding, and I think you'll find that this climb becomes less intimidating very soon. 

All you say is absolutely true, the rest of us just put up with it I suppose. But here's a suggestion that's specific to where you live - if you want to get back on the bike, how about heading for the velodrome? $URL$ Obviously this would depend just how good your sight is, but this is something I've discovered over the last 6 months (not at Manchester but at Calshot on the south coast). Very exhilarating and of course no traffic to contend with. 

I used to take the family bikes over to western Europe and never had a problem leaving them overnight. This would have been maybe USD3000s worth of bikes at various places in France, Germany and Benelux. First of all I was able to lock the rack onto the car - it was a pretty Mickey-Mouse lock but would nevertheless deter an opportunist thief. Next I would lock the frames together, and to the rack, using a couple of my regular bike locks. These were much more heavy duty, Fahgettaboudit locks. This combination worked fine for me. It was obviously enough to put people off. We didn't park in the centre of cities, but nevertheless these were public locations in quite substantial towns. So I didn't detach the wheels, but I did lock each up with a combination of chains and D-locks. For any would-be thief, their quickest option would have been to steal three bikes and a rack all in one go, which I guess could have happened but fortunately didn't. I guess the moral is to have some good locks visible and in use, and to be aware of where you're parking. 

Float, which is the degree to which one can rotate one's feet while clipped in, can sometimes be an issue. In other words, all clipless pedal systems-- so-called because they replace the toe clips with cleats of some kind-- restrict the amount that you can rotate your feet while clipped in (i.e., while the cleat is connected to the pedal). This was the primary reason I switched from SPDs to Speedplays. Initially I rode using SPDs, but as the other respondents mentioned, I was getting hot foot on longer rides, and eventually some knee pain, which turned out to be caused by an SPD cleat that was slightly mis-aligned. That was the impetus, because with Speedplays it's not an issue at all. It seemed like a win-win to me: more float, and minimal alignment issues (provided the cleat is correctly positioned on one's shoe). But I am not a commuter. Here is the amount of nominal float one can obtain from various pedal systems, in no particular order: 

Ultimately its going to be down to how zealous you want to be. When you think of cleaning a chain, you need to think of two things. First, there is the cleaning - getting off the dirt and lube that has caked itself onto the chain. Then, there is lubing the chain to make it run nicely, (As part of a lube you'd maybe give the chain a rub with a dry cloth to try and get surface crap off, but wouldn't be soaking it in degreaser). When maintaining a chain, you wouldn't necessarily do both of these at the same time. You would lube the chain quite regularly, but most likely would clean the chain less frequently. You'd never clean the chain without also lubing it. For frequency of lubing, the answer is "it depends". We all have different preferences. If its a bike that doesn't get ridden often, you'd maybe lube the chain before every ride. A commuter, ridden daily, you'd maybe lube every week or two. Also, you need to recognise that there are (many) different types of lube, for different conditions. The viscosity varies a lot between them. So if you're putting a lightweight dry lube on your chain (which you might do in the summer), its going to be far less likely to muck up your chain than a gloopy wet weather lube. So the answer to "when do I clean it?" is also "it depends". Ideally you don't want any dirt on your chain. That would improve both smoothness and chain life. So the anal extreme is to clean and lube it after every ride. But most probably you'd go through the "lube" process several times before you considered degreasing. And, as I say, the lube you use will determine likely you are to pick up crap off the road. A wet weather lube, for example, might be good at repelling water, but it's corresponding stickiness will also attract dirt. If I were to stick my finger in the air I'd say that personally I give my chains a thorough degrease probably around 3 times a year (on the bikes that I ride regularly). But knowing when to do this, I judge this by looking how much crap is on it as I'm lubing it - it's certainly balanced toward winter/wet riding, but it's a judgement call. Give the cogs a decent clean at the same time as you clean the chain, otherwise you're just going to transfer muck from on to the other. 

What I've found is that I get back pain when I'm too stretched out. That is, when the reach is too much for me, I get back pain. You can see the measurement I'm referring to in the picture below. 

You don't mention the type of bicycle you're referring to, but if you look at your wheels with the tube out and the tires off, you can probably see what the root cause is. Bicycle wheels should have rim tape or a rim strip that protects the tube from the spoke holes in the rim. Of the two approaches, the rim strip is the more modern. The rim strip can be rubber, or plastic, or a slightly stretchable woven material (polyester fabric, for example). Usually if you have an undamaged rim strip of the correct size for your wheel, it is highly unlikely that your tube is being punctured by contact with the spoke holes/spoke nipples. It might be cut by the hole where the valve stem goes through the rim, but if so it should be obvious. However if you have rim tape, even if it is the correct width, it's possible the rim tape is not adhering to the rim in one or more locations, and could be moving around under the tube, thus exposing the spoke holes, and causing your tubes to pop. The leak you describe-- taking a few minutes to become flat-- suggests a small hole, and this is not inconsistent with a tube cut by a spoke hole, but usually such a cut is big enough to let the air out almost immediately. To find out, inspect your leaky tube. Remove it from the wheel, and pump a bit of air into it. Where is the hole? If it is on the valve side of the tube-- the portion which comes into contact with rim tape/rim strip/spoke holes-- then this may be your problem. Hold the tube under water, if necessary, to see where bubbles emerge. If the hole is on the outside of the tube, where the tube is in contact with your tire, you need to check the tire carefully. One might expect the bike shop did this, but you never know. Run your fingers over the inside of the tire. As the other responder suggested, you can get a small hole from a piece of wire (a "michelin thorn") that has punctured your tire casing, or a goat-head thorn, or a piece of glass. You need to remove that from the tire casing, or it will puncture every new tube you put in. 

Based on your comment, I think I may have misunderstood your original question. Most bike shops I know seem to be "licensed resellers" for just a couple of brands. My local shop, for example, stocks only Bianchi and Specialized. If I want to buy a Trek I need to go someplace else. A lot of web sites in the cycling business (certainly in the UK) are basically virtual fronts for bricks-and-mortar shops, so it doesn't really surprise me that when you go to a particular web site, you don't see a broad range of brands. To be honest, if you are looking for a branded frame, your best approach might be to go in the other direction. Find the frame that you like, then find a dealer (either locally or through a web site). You might need a dealer's help in any case if you're looking just for a frame rather than a complete bike. But e.g. Bianchi offer frames on their site, so presumably someone, somewhere will sell you one! In my comment I mentioned a couple of bike shops who (I think) have brought in generic carbon frames and built and branded them. That route may also be an option. 

The most practical solution would be to upgrade your brake pads. They may seem expensive, but both Koolstop and SwissStop work pretty good. Search around, there are many online sellers. You can see a significant change in brake performance with the right pads installed. 

I'm sure my risk calculus is different from the OP's, but I heard a piece of advice some time before from a seasoned dirt rider around my age (mid-40's): "If you can't climb it, don't descend it." Clearly this advice is not applicable to everyone at every time, but in practice I have found this is not bad. 

You didn't mention what gauge you used, but there are many kinds. Take a look at that link; it is worth reading, as is this thread. The current smoothness of the shifting isn't usually the deciding factor regarding when to change, but rather the cost of the other components that wear faster when the chain is worn: the cassette, and the front chainwheels. The idea is to replace the chain (relatively cheap in comparison) before it starts to damage the more expensive cassette and front chainwheels. In my experience I get about 2,000-2,500 miles out of a CN-6701, and I'm riding in near-ideal conditions (Southern California weather). I'm pretty careful about keeping my chain clean and properly lubed. I typically replace the cassette about every three chains, and the front chainwheels (Ultegra as well) are still OK. 

I think you need to start from the point where you say that any lock is breakable, if the thief is sufficiently determined. But I do think your insurance arrangements will have a bearing on what lock to buy. So, rather than asking "what lock should I get to prevent my bike being stolen?", I think it makes more sense to ask "what lock do I need to get so that if my bike gets stolen, the insurance co will cough up?" So essentially rather than asking your question on here, it might be more useful just to contact your insurance company and ask them for a list of approved locks. You don't say where in the world you live, but in the UK there is a "sold secure" scheme which I think a lot of insurers use, with different levels (bronze, silver, gold) required depending on the value of the bike. Its also worth noting that the lock on its own is most likely only part of the story - my own policy places restrictions on what I can lock the bike to (must be immovable) and where and for how long I can leave the bike unattended. On the Sold Secure scheme itself, I've spoken to people who say that it is all a marketing ploy to get you to buy certain locks over others, and their rating of a particular lock has no bearing on how good the lock is. This may or may not be the case, but again I'd stress that its not about preventing the bike from being stolen, its about the insurance company paying out. I'm making an assumption that your bike is insured. If it isn't, you're really taking a punt when you buy a lock. It might be worth going over to the "Sold Secure" web site (or seeing if there is an equivalent scheme in your country) but as I say it is questionable just how objective these schemes are.
