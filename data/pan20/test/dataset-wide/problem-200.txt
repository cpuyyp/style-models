A priori you don't need magic for any of the points you mentioned, though you do need some explanation for having a gravity similar to Earth's in a planet that it is twice the size. A planet with the same average density as Earth and double its radius, as you propose (Earth has a 40000 km circumpherence), will have eight times the Earth's mass, but since the surface will be twice the distance from the center of mass and gravity decreases by the square of the distance, surface gravity in your planet will be twice that of Earth. That's "similar", for some values of "similar", though rather uncomfortable for actual Earth-born humans. If you want your planet to have less surface gravity then it should be less dense. The problem is that the elements (iron, nickel) needed for a massive core that can generate a magnetic field (which is somewhat of a requisite for surface habitability of complex organisms) are heavy. The planet can rotate at any rate you want, within reason. In general we have found that larger planets rotate faster, but that's not a hard-and-fast rule. If you're willing to work with twice Earth's gravity, then you don't need any magic. Even in that gravity normal humans will be able to live, if not very comfortably. Natively evolved beings should have no problem at all. 

Short answer: yes, you can. There have been many species of flying, scaly, toothed reptiles on Earth (pterosaurs). Not all of them had teeth and many apparently had some hair-like fluff, but that's optional. For aerodynamic reasons a flying creature will probably evolve towards having a pointed snout, or very narrow jaws, or a beak, but there are ways to compensate. In any case, a beak need not be a fragile thing. 

If magic is involved you are free to decide. The moon's orbit might well lie entirely outside the magnetic field. If not, expect interactions with the magnetic field of the moon. That's as far as I can go, being no expert. 

Yes. Tidal locking is the end of a process (of tidal acceleration) that might take millions of years. A moon (or any other body orbiting a larger body) will avoid tidal lockingâ€¦ 

Genetically engineer them to produce Botulinum toxin as their venom or make them capable of developing a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria that produces it. 

Tiny Robots Instead of relatively high-velocity weapons or directed energy weapons, launch small robotic payloads that once they hit their target can seek out a vulnerability in the armor and exploit it. The tiny robots can carry whatever payload you like to defeat armor: tiny shaped charge, drills and acid, electrical shock, work together to dismantle armor/target. Such machines could even change direction in mid-air (space) and determine friend from foe. This concept appears in the book Seveneves by Neil Stephenson as a method of warfare that won't hurt the hulls of spacecraft. 

Earth With Rings The Rings First things first. Rings around a planet are comparatively short-lived. For example, there is speculation that the rings of Saturn may be very young and only have a 100 million or so years left in existence. They will fall into the plant thanks to gravitation interactions between other bodies in the solar system and radiation pressure from the sun. The important takeaway is that rigs from through some other cataclysm after a plant has formed. So your planet will form much like the earth, accrete mass, clear out its orbit, get hit by another body and form the moon. Hey look the earth has rings! 

Nothing to it Since time is your ally, make like Genghis Khan whom apparently .5% of the human population is directly descended from. Instructions for spreading you seed across the earth: Step 1: Conquer a region of the earth. Eliminate competing gene pool, which should occur during the conquering. The Mongols only conquered 12 million square miles, and they slaughtered those that opposed them. Step 2: Get very busy and enjoy the spoils of victory. Step 3: Repeat as necessary. Use army of wolves to keep your many wives from killing you. Exponential growth will do the rest. Keep tabs on your daughters to avoid inbreeding Step 4: Encourage widespread immigration of descendants to maintain healthy genetic diversity. Unless you mean literally spreading your seed across the earth 

If your world is more or less like ours, and there is no magic, then your typical gryphons will never be able to fly. By typical I'm assuming you mean the size of big cats. There's a reason why large birds don't fly, or can only fly a bit by launching from high perches, or fly very clumsily, or rely mainly on soaring on thermal currents. It has to do with the strength of muscles v. the weight of those muscles and the bones that support them. Even forgetting those inconvenient facts, I foresee stability problems, as a typical cat-like animal would have a relatively big and heavy head on one end and bulky, heavy hindquarters on the other, which would make it very difficult for it not to lose balance if there's only one pair of wings in the midsection. I would advise that you gave the physical realism of the setting a big handwave and just go with the typical gryphons as you imagined them, unless you want them to do something specific with their bird tails. Gryphons belong in the fantasy genre anyway, so their presence should signal the reader that they shouldn't expect scientific accuracy. 

Of course this inclination is relative to the equator of the planet, not to the plane of its orbit around its star. But since you specified that the planet's axial tilt is a moderate one, I'm assuming "inclined with respect to the equator" implies "inclined with respect to the orbital plane". If the axial tilt is zero, then that would be a polar orbit. I have no idea how much time it would take for the Kozai mechanism to destabilize a highly-inclined orbit. 

Even at the top of Everest you won't be able to see the curvature of Earth. So that shouldn't be a problem. The real problem is looking at ever increasing distances and not bumping into any hard limit. On a flat Earth, in theory, you could see as far as you wanted provided you had a sufficiently powerful eyeglass. In practice this would be limited by Rayleigh scattering. If that's not enough, there could be a neverending storm front at the border of the world blocking the view. Or a circular waterfall going all around the world and feeding a circular river or sea. Since you're making up the physics, it's your call. I think you should make this boundary as interesting as possible and get it to work for the story. 

First of all, why does your apparently money-less barter system need to have a single universal unit of measurement? "If you have a defined unit, in which the value of everything else is expressed, then you have a currency, and you no longer have a barter based economy" And why have you chosen to use a barter system? Are you just trying to come up with alternative exchange systems and economies to make the setting feel alien? I recommend figuring out the needs of the characters in your world and then creating the money system around that, rather than the other way round. Here's an Article in the Atlantic that might give you another starting point: $URL$ or read/ look up Debt: the first 5,000 years by David Graeber. -basically, barter systems existing before credit and currency is a myth. If you're looking for stories- 2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson is a great story in a setting with a partial command economy in which the resources are distributed by AI systems based on need. Also, Neptune's Brood by Charles Stross details some speculative financial instruments as part of a futuristic version of capitalism that allows slower-than-light interstellar trade 

Here's a few thoughts from the Orion's Arm Universe Project: Non-fungible Goods and Services in Post-scarcity Societies $URL$ Technically speaking no post-scarcity economy has truly eliminated scarcity (rather the term comes from the transition to economics of abundance). Correspondingly there will always be certain commodities that are scarce, even if copies can be mass produced. Examples of these non-fungible goods and services are original pieces of artwork, specific areas of land and services from a particular individual or group. Scarcity economic principles still apply but generally the demand for non-fungible commodities is still so low that most individuals are excluded from the economy. Systems of dealing with this (outside of individual gifting) differ but most systems account for this in some way. Below are a few common methods. Private Markets As with scarcity economics private markets can be used to trade unique items or services. Currency can be fiat or not (depending on local custom). Most sophonts rarely have a need to interact in a private market as social infrastructure can provide for nearly all needs, exceptions include specific living space, art, branded goods and live entertainment. It is often difficult for sophonts to enter a market if they do not already own something unique or are capable of a desirable service. There are various solutions to this varying by local custom, two prominent examples are to seek a private loan or to make use of publicly available education and augmentation to create something able to be sold on a market. A third and common option is rapid barter (see below). Common Ownership and Rentism Various goods such as original artworks or plots of land maybe held in common ownership. As such it is not possible for them to be traded between individuals (at least without true ownership still residing with society at large). Because of this it is quite common for a form of rent to be employed with individuals paying with whatever resources their economic system allows (e.g. a portion of their socially provided allocation of credits). Rent may be conditional with set durations which are determined legally but could also depend on how much a sophont is willing or able to pay. Alternatively or additionally an individual may have to meet certain criteria before they are eligible to rent. Common Ownership and Lottery Non-fungible goods are held in common ownership but they can be allocated to individuals for a set time in a lottery system. Usually sophonts put their name in for a specific commodity and a periodic lottery determines who gets it as well as what conditions come with the allocation. Once the time is up the sophont loses ownership rights and has to apply again. Post-scarcity Economies: Characteristics and Considerations $URL$ Autonomous Industry Almost all post-scarcity economies arise after significant development in automation, both physical and intellectual, that almost entirely negates the need for sophont labour. In effect automated technologies (chiefly robotics and artificial intelligence) reach a point in which all tasks including the design, construction and installation of new automation are automated. This feature of post-scarcity economies is the basis for most other characteristics and is the spur for the development of post-labour economic theories. Steady state and Circular Economics With sufficient economic commitment and/or molecular nanotechnology industries can be designed with near-perfect recycling in mind, facilitating a transition towards a steady state economy. Waste products can either come in forms safe to release into a surrounding biosphere or be used as raw materials for other industries. Particularly with advanced nanotechnology any substance can be broken down into its constituent elements (given energy and time) ready to be rebuilt. Whilst not a necessary characteristic of post-scarcity economies most adopt the practice as it avoids the huge potential for environmental damage unchecked growth of automated industry could cause. Whilst the resources available to a post-scarcity economy can be vast (potentially multiple solar systems worth of matter and energy) autonomous industry can potentially grow exponentially. This has been the cause of more than one Cinder system. In addition steady state economic principles are often put in place to prevent overconsumption or greed and to encourage an ecologically friendly culture. 

Triggering Death By Lightning About Lightning Firstly, a quick overview of lightning and specifically the cases between the cloud and ground. You probably get a lightning bolt when the charge potential between the base of the cloud and the ground reaches the electrical breakdown of the air. These charges are built up by the motion of water/ice in a storm. There are other possibilities for the trigger, which be explored shortly, but the root is the massive charge difference between the clouds and ground. There are several forms of lightning but generally speaking, the charge flows from the cloud to the earth. 

Climate Depends on several things, if we are sticking with the Earth-Sun system then the Earth will get much hotter since it will receive more the solar energy than it gets now. Probably pretty bad for the majority of life on earth but Antarctica could be a nice place to live at least. Now, this is assuming nothing is done to alter the Earth. If we are talking moving planets then altering the atmosphere is easy. Removing the greenhouse gasses is one step that could preserve the earth because without them the earth would be very cold. With a faster rotation expect winds to be very different, again hard to say directly but expect them to be moving faster. The Coriolis Effect will play a much larger part in the weather than it does here on earth. A combination of more winds and higher temp extremes probably will cause superstorms. Probably still habitable, just much hotter. For example the solar system inner limit may be as low as .5 AU. 

Yes The answer is here. Only takes 25 Billion nukes the size of the Tzar Bomba to do it. The process To completely destroy a planet you need to impart more energy into it than its gravitational binding energy which is calculated using the following equation $E = \frac{3GM^2}{5R}$ Filling in the universal gravitational constant, Mass and Radius of pluto; $6.67\times10^{-11} m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$, $1.3\times10^{22}kg$, $1.15\times10^6m$ respectivly. You get $5.9\times10^{27}$ joules of energy. Which is ~25 billion times the energy in the Tzar Bomba with only $2.4\times10^{17}$ joules.
