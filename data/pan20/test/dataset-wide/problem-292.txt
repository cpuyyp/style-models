I know that I may have just made a lot of you angry (or at least made a small number of you VERY angry). Let me be clear: I don't believe that people with any of these disorders don't deserve to live anything like that. I do believe that these problems and ailments are things which lower a person's potential usefulness to society, lower their ability to enjoy and perceive the world, and/or place extraordinary burdens on their loved ones. Given the chance to prevent these conditions, I'll take it. Also, this list isn't exhaustive, and if I've left out some ailment, it's not intended as an insult or dismissal. To prevent problems from creeping back into our group of modified humans: 

Possibility #1: Nothing to fight over Why would they want to conquer the rest of the continent anyway? They don't need land for food, they don't need water, they don't need houses to sleep in, etc. It's like asking why humans haven't yet waged war against earthworms, a species we outclass in terms of combat effectiveness. We have nothing to gain by fighting them. As for why nobody has forged an alliance with the Athar and then conquered everybody, you'd still be facing a fundamental issue: what do you pay them? Do Athar even care about gold, silver, or gemstones? Possibility #2: They actually need humans for some reason For all we know, the Athar actually rely on humans. Maybe the Athar live better in an atmosphere with more magical energy, and humans create that atmosphere. Maybe the Athar value the dexterity of humans and their capacity to work fine details. Maybe the Athar find humans to be intellectually stimulating and fun to be around. Of course, some of those reasons could result in the Athar trying to enslave humans, but once again... why enslave them when they those things naturally, anyways? "Guess what, GROC? If you give humans some of the flimsy yellow metal, they'll make you cool stuff." "Oh wow, I was just going to throw it away. Thanks for the tip!" (probably some rock dudes, a long time ago) Possibility #3: Culture of peace I don't know about you, but most of the rocks I know are quite peaceful creatures. I've never been attacked by a rock, and I've met thousands. Possibility #4: Humans are weaker but better at war Humans have been killing things bigger and stronger than themselves for millenia. What makes the Athar so special that we'll never figure out how to beat them? Possibility #5: Combination of some/all of the above 

Domesticate the dang things. Call them snogs (snake + dog) You don't even have to fully domesticate them, if they're super territorial. You just have to coax a decent-sized group into claiming your ship as 'theirs' in such a way that they defend it from other flying serpents but let your people load, unload, and operate it. You'll want to keep breeding them towards being friendlier to people, but it really shouldn't be too long before you can get them safe enough for trained personnel to operate near them. Wolves are smart enough to not attack something that will cause them serious damage - predators can't afford to get seriously injured. Therefore, your domesticated snogs flying serpents shouldn't have to actually fight a bunch of other flying serpents... they just have to be scary enough that the other ones leave your ship alone. Now, what to do if you still have to fight the suckers? Sand-shotguns! (Doesn't require gunpowder... can just use something like a crossbow.) Salt guns work wonders against bugs - I figure the same principle works on a larger scale too. Most flying things are quite fragile, so it doesn't take much to knock them out of the air. You could tinker with different sands and dirts, trying to find a good balance between stopping power, range, and cost. Biggest advantage here is that sand and dirt won't damage your ship when you miss. You'd have to be careful to wipe it off to avoid weighing down your ship and stuff, but that's easier than patching holes. 

I'm adding this, since I'm surprised that nobody has come up with the Babel fish approach (see Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) - be unbelievably useful to some violent sentient creature, but in a pacifist manner. I'll come up with an example case to clarify. Let's say that there is some volcanic planet with tons of variation in atmospheric conditions. These conditions create small zones, and almost all species adapt to live in just one zone. On one side of the planet, an extremely violent and powerful species (Species A) develops intelligence, but they are limited to their zone. On the other side of the planet, Species B develops. Species B possesses the ability to convert atmospheric compounds into other atmospheric compounds. They use this ability to survive and thrive on their side of the planet, since they had to develop intelligence in order to fully exploit their amazing mobility in such a complex environment. Species B is pacifist and can survive as pacifists since they can create inhospitable environments to defend themselves. It's hard to kill something when you can't even breathe when you're within 5 miles of them. No predators develop which can do the same trick, since the mechanism is too inefficient and too slow. Species A and B are initially separated by some significant barrier. Sometime after both species develop sentience, an explorer, Bob, from Species B enters Species A territory and makes first contact with an individual of Species A, Adam. This occurs at the very edge of what Species A considers 'habitable' space, an area where the atmospheric compounds are too 'bitter' for Adam to survive long. Adam grabs Bob and prepares to eat him, but realizes at the last second that the air has become much 'sweeter' near 'Bob'. Adam realizes how useful this is and then goes out exploring in previously impossible regions, carrying a terrified Bob with him. Adam quickly discovers that Bob is sentient, and they establish some form of arrangement with Bob where Adam protects and feeds Bob while Bob makes the air 'sweet' for Adam. Adam and Bob work together to create a super-tribe of incredibly-mobile Species A warriors, whose superior mobility enables them to conquer all non-union Species A and B's. The alliance is forged, and now we have the sweet spot for a sentient, pacifist species. Species B's best survival strategy from here on is to be completely passive and just work together with Species A. Also, Species B doesn't have evolutionary pressure to devolve sentience, since ensuring 'sweet' air for Species A is very mentally-challenging. Species A has no incentive to try and develop machines to replace Species B since Species B is really, really good at what they do, cost almost nothing to maintain, and are extremely pleasant companions. 

Well, since you're already time-traveling, I figure you can have anti-grav technology. Assuming you have this, then the easiest way to determine time would be to have a look at the position of the continents. Bring a small anti-grav drone with a transmitter, send it up, have it calculate the year, and then recall it. This would be much faster than waiting for stars, and wouldn't be subject to weather (good luck reading the stars from ground-level in monsoon season.) And, just in case the drone can't see the continents due to arriving when the dinosaurs died, it should still be able to use star positions. It'll just take longer. Finally, if all other options fail, measure the mass of the sun. It doesn't change perfectly regularly across its entire history, but assuming you're going back less than a billion years you should be able to find a model that works. 

I have yet to see this, so I'll add it as a suggestion: make the sea itself inhospitable to organic materials (including humans). As in, make it so that the water has some weird chemical composition or there is a microbe/small creature in the water that will eat away and dissolve any organic material in a matter of hours - think barnacles on steroids - far too soon to reach anything beyond the sea and far too late to swim back to shore and tell anybody about the problem. Now, I don't think you want to kill people who just went for a quick swim, so you could have this toxic element start in the deeper ocean. Basically, you make the area near the shore safe-ish and not have this problem, but if you sail a day or so out then your boat will sink and you will certainly drown or get dissolved by the same effect that destroyed the boat. 13th-century technology is no way capable of making a blue-water vessel out of non-organic materials or of creating a coating which can resist the water's corrosive abilities, so this barrier will completely prevent navigation by water. You'll just have to make the wall extend 25 miles out to the side from the peninsula, and you'll be good to go. 

They do this because merchants are motivated by profit, not fame or dominion. Therefore, any situation where they can buy something and sell it later for more money than it costs them is a good thing, regardless of what the thing is (assuming it's not morally questionable, dangerous to transport, etc.) In fact, as long as they can reasonably expect to find a buyer/seller, any merchant with the capital should happily buy/sell any artifact. Also, considering that these artifacts are probably more weight-efficient than other goods, it's even better for merchants that can stomach the initial cost of its purchase. Video game players make similar decisions all the time - it's usually better to trade/loot goods that are worth more by weight. 

It's an investment/trade. Species X is part of this dimension now, and its members need resources from our dimension in order to survive and thrive. What better way to get local resources than with the help of some influential locals? You see, Species X don't just fuse with anybody: they fuse with members of the ruling class in exchange for unlimited access to desired resources. "Hey, prince dealing with a major rebellion, I bring you an offer. I will fuse with you for a decade, and then for a week or two every year afterwards, and in exchange you give me all the food I want, a house near the strongest magical nexus in the kingdom, and a small force of servants." Win-win. King guy now is an invincible battlemage when he needs to be, and the Species X thing now only has to "work" for two weeks a year. The initial decade of fusion is a short time on the Species X timescale, so it's not that bad. Species X may only care about magical reserves, but having more time and energy free for storing/finding magic is worth the time and energy expended while fused. 

Kill them. Then kill the baby eco-titans. Kill them until they're so rare that the only people who go out to kill them are dentists from a different continent. Hey, it worked for lions. The real question is how humans will take trophies after the kill. Do you use the stomach lining as a rug? Do you mount a spore on your wall? Maybe the eco-titans have cool-looking reproductive organs to cut off and gift as a romantic gesture (wait, isn't that roses?) 

Seriously though, just imagine hundreds of hornets going straight for exposed skin, intelligently crawling into clothing, targeting limbs and groin... like demonic flying Chihuahuas whose bite paralyzes and introduces you to new meanings of the word 'pain'. On to the murder kitties! Pros of the hyper-intelligent lions: 

When using this information, please note that ocean currents can change cyclically - google El Nino for a real-life example. This means that it's possible that the area that's normally wet can sometimes be dry and vice-versa. Now let's talk temperature. According to this reasonable-seeming website, you drop 4 degrees Fahrenhiet for every 1,000 feet, which means that mountains that are ~14,000 feet or higher are probably snow-covered year-round. Bonus points: If you go to their link, they've got a cool little graphic showing different vegetation groups for various altitudes. Tl;Dr - because your mountain only will block East-west winds, you can freely choose what climate both sides will have, and any mountain over ~13,500 feet can expect to have snow. Also, this can be something that changes cyclically over time. 

I mean, it's possible to breathe liquids: $URL$ However, this video reveals additional concerns, mostly with regard to skin condition. Human skin is designed to operate in air, not water, and many of its protective features will fail after extended exposure to liquid. For additional discomfort, just imagine the chafing. Even being a little sweaty can cause serious chafing for people... imagine being totally soaked 24-7. Additionally, such a liquid environment would probably be a great conductor for electricity. You know how ridiculous it is for StarTrademark to show battle damage by having giant arcs of electricity injure/kill bridge crew? You've basically just made that reality - except now a single plug breaks its water-tight casing and you fry the entire mess hall. And now all your on-board electronics and crew tools have to be water-tight... the expense would be incredible.
