Much of the World War One slaughter was more due to a lack of imagination, coupled with a distrust (in European armies) for uncommissioned men. Read a good book on the Vimy Ridge assault by the Canadian Corps, under Arthur Currie. Two fundamental changes were made in preparation. Information Rather than issuing the timetabale to every commissioned officer in the Canadian Corps, Currie had the timetables and objectives printed and issued to every rank down to lance corporal. This ensured that units could continue on the proper schedule even in the vent of suffering casualties to all officers. This was important because the intent of the walking barrage was so that assaulting troop s would be in the German trenches less than 60 seconds, ideally 30 seconds, after the barrage lifted. Individual gun calibration As guns fire a long barrage the barrels heat up, and their range drops due to the increased windage. Before Vimy, generals on both sides calibrated guns by their age, on the premise that anything more precise was pointless. This led to barrages walking backwards, generating friendly fire casualties and preventing assaulting troops from getting in to the enemy trenches soon enough after the barrage lifted. In the 4 months preceding Vimy, Currie had every single gun individually calibrated, every 5 shells. During the attack itself, this allowed the Canadian troops to stay within 50 yards of the barrage, easily getting into most of the German trenches within 60 or even 30 seconds. The result was a successful capture of Vimy Ridge with only 1/4 of the casualties sustained during the unsuccessful French attempt. 

Time your conclusion, and practice I until it is the best part of your presentation. Prepare about 5-7 minutes more material than you have time to present; plan your talk so that you can drop the excess material when the buzzer announces time to start your conclusion. Practice this. You will then have visuals for the most obvious questions asked by the panel. Nothing wows a panel more than ending your talk within seconds of the final buzzer, and having visuals for their questions. 

Appendices A and B of The Official History of the Canadian Army in the First World War show that the divisions of the Canadian Corps were composed of three infantry brigades, plus divisional artillery and headquarters sections, throughout their deployment in France. In turn, these brigades were each composed of 4 battalions throughout their deployments. The Canadian Corps was organized in a manner consistent with practice throughout the remainder of the British Army, including battalion structure at an establishment of 1007 men including 30 officers. Substantive changes through the period of the war seem to have been solely in the allocation of support units such as artillery and other heavy weapons such as machine guns sections. 

That is certainly in the ball park, given that artillery rounds have been omitted, and only bullets made in the US counted. It is worth noting that most shots on the field of battle (probably above 90%) are fired simply to provide the enemy with an excuse to keep his head down, and not with intent to kill, nor to wound, nor even particularly aimed at the enemy but simply fired in his general vicinity. 

Barring positive evidence of large-scale population movement since 983 AD, this ethnographic map of Vietnam in 1970 (from here) would seem to be definitive that the Vietnamese people achieved their own independence. It seems well established that the people of the Red River Delta led the fight for independence - an area today predominantly ethnic Vietnamese. 

Because the territories where those languages originated were ruled by Rome, not Athens or Byzantium, for a semi-millennium. In areas where contact with Byzantium/Constantinople dominated contact with Rome, such as Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the Cyrillic alphabet is primary. Here is a map showing those countries where the Cyrillic alphabet is primary. 

It's a pounce pot, being used to dry the wet ink without having to blot it. As noted here, the pounce itself could be made from any of powdered gum sandarac; crushed pumice (origin of pounce I believe), cuttlefish bone, or eggshell; or allum mixed with resin. This was used both to size the writing surface as well as to dry the ink after writing, and the choice of pounce might be dictated by the requirements. Vellum as well as (unsized rag) paper were the most common writing surfaces, though as noted school desks and privy walls were also not unheard of. Each of these surfaces posed its own challenges to proper calligraphy, from the greasiness of vellum to the roughness of wood or unsized paper, which an appropriate choice and use of pounce could alleviate. 

As noted in The Catholic Encyclopedia (published 1907 and now in the public domain and fully digitized) there has been a gradual change in the meaning and usage of the term diocese over nearly the past two millennia, as well as varied usage between those regions formerly part of the Eastern and Western Roman Empire respectively: 

The reason aged whiskey is so much more expensive than younger has to do with the cost of the long storage. The cost of the barrels is much less even considering that the barrels must be refilled regularly as some of the whiskey evaporates through the oak and is replaced by oxygen. It is the very gradual exposure to trace amounts of oxygen that causes the oxygen (thus why product in screw-top bottles ceases aging), but the process must be kept very gradual for optimum effect. Also, barrels can be reused, and previously used barrels are actually preferred for the longest malt Scotch whiskeys: 

Many French may have borne arms for the Axis, but it was very soft support; not many of them ever fired a shot in anger for the Axis. Even in October/November 1942 with the Axis at flood tide, Vichy North Africa rapidly switched allegiance after the Torch Landings at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers, despite some initial confused opposition. Following the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Charles de Gaulle very effectively began mobilizing a French Army that number well over 1,000,000 men in the field by the following spring. Update: From Wikipedia for Operation Torch following the invasion on November 8, 1942 (and consistent with descriptions both by Churchill and Manchester & Reid): 

I don't know if there is a proven definitive answer to this, but let me propose an explanation from first principles. At the time that Labour Unions were organizing in North America, and lobbying for legal recognition, careers such as teamsters and longshoremen were largely selected from the recently immigrated communities of Italians, Irish, and East Europeans. The tight knit nature of these immigrant communities provided an insularity from the community at large, particularly the legal authorities, that was fertile ground for organized crime. In particular, the natural progression for immigrants was often to be low-skill manual labour the first generation, progressing into the police the next, and then into the more general middle class the third. This meant that for several decades around the turn of the twentieth century the ethnicity of the police and the low-end manual labour were different. In Europe and Britain there was still a class distinction, but there would have been much more overlap with the class that populated the police, providing a much less fertile soil for organized crime to take root. 

The German high command (OKW and OKH) was never of a single mind on anything but, not being privy to the intense pressure applied by Stalin for a second front in France, many high ranking officers believed that the Western Allies would begin the re-conquest of Western Europe by invading Norway and then blocking transport of the Swedish iron ore which were almost as vital to the German war effort as the oil in Ploesti. This importance in the minds of both Hitler and the Wehrmacht can be seen by tracking number of divisions stationed in Norway over the curse of the war: 

As you can see Boston-Providence occurs 5th, as your initial estimate expected. Update: Remember also that the 1898 consolidation of New York City into 5 boroughs remains controversial in both Brooklyn and Staten Island, as witness the 1990's plan by Staten Island to secede, which had to be blocked by the New York State Assembly. Updated to 2010 Census - Boston returns to 5th place 

To a large extent both Alexander and his father were inspired by the Ten THousand, as well as the Greeks' dramatic victories against the invasions by Darius and Xerxes. In these campaigns the Greek heavy hoplite infantry had proved itself more than a match for the best that the Persians could muster. Once united under the Macedonian mantle, a force of sufficient size to contemplate overthrowing the Persian empire could be contemplated. Although the spear is usually listed as the hoplite's primary weapon, this is misleading. The hoplite shield was cleverly built to both enable the wearer to rest it on his shoulder while covering his leftward colleague, or to wield it as a very effective weapon. Due to the manner in which it strapped onto the wearer's forearm, it was easily maneuvered by a hoplite both as a ram to knock his opponent over, and as a blunt knife to deliver a severs blow from it's edge. Although less maneuverable than the later Roman maniple, the phalanx was a tactical battlefield unit which the Persians simply were unable to handle without overwhelming numbers. With the how dealt with , now consider the why. As much as anything, I believe it was to prove his worth to his father, and because he could. 

This insert from Harper's Weekly issue for Dec. 24, 1862, shows Santa stuffing gifts down the chimney of a Union soldier's wife and children (upper left corner) and to encamped Union soldiers (upper right corner). One can certainly argue that this is intended to imply that the Union cause is a righteous one, and thus that the image qualifies as a (political, non-commercial) advertisement. 

Our only source both reliable and substantial on Spartan life is Xenophon on the Constitution of the Lacedaimonians. Xenophon reports that the Spartan boys were required to supply themselves with a substantial portion of their own food ration, by foraging and stealing, and 

Update #2 - Gunboats: The guns mounted on gunboats are harder to assess; because of being dependent on the (variable) height at which they were mounted. If actually mounted on a flat bottomed barge I would treat them like any other gun above. However if deck-mounted more than a few height higher their effectiveness at range would have been greatly impeded - their shot would simply not have skipped properly from that height. In the latter case I would not even attempt to fire them at range, but would have them brought in close to shore and reserved as battery defence, to sweep the area of any threatened or captured guns of enemies with case shot. Standing ten or twenty yards off shore, firing only at ranges under about 300 yards, and then always at maximum fire rate, they would have been almost impregnable to assault, yet capable of a devastating anti-personnel fire. Update #3 In 1809 - Thunder on the Danube III - Wagram and Znaim Jack Gill notes in endnote #98 to Appendix 13 that of Reynier's 109 artillery pieces on Lobau Island between 20 and 24 were 18 pound cannons. The number is uncertain because 4 guns of unspecified caliber, from the final reinforcement before the battle, were delayed and did not arrive in time for the fighting. This grand battery on Lobau Island was used to cover the crossing of Napoleon's troops across the Stadtler Arm on the night of July 4th, 1809, and anchored Napoleon's right wing during the breakout from the bridgehead and subsequent battle. 

It was, after all, in the disastrous charge by Pickett the next day where nearly half of all Confederate casualties for the battle were incurred. The truly awesome defensive capability of a modern army, that would be exposed to the entire world in 1915 at Verdun, was already evident, for those willing to see, on the Round Tops and Cemetery Ridge in that first week of July, 1863. Lee, on July 2 and 3 1863, choose to accept any number of Confederate casualties for the pipedream of winning the Civil War in a single battle. Ironically, the consequent destruction of his army's offensive capability ended all hope for a negotiated settlement with the North. Like the Japanese commander at Midway eight decades later, Lee was the only commander on the field who could lose the war in an afternoon. 

I believe Cyrano de Bergerac's Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon and The States and Empires of the Sum, both published posthumously in 1657 and 1662 respectively, precede both Swift's Gulliver's Travels (published 1726, amended 1735) and Voltaire's Micromegas of 1752. Arthur C. Clarke credits Cyrano' books with: 

You are looking at a poor translation: There were three classes of individuals under the law. A mushkenu was a landless freed man who had to accept monetary compensation for corporal injuries done to him. He often owed a type of feudal duty to a landholder or patron. 

No, there is at best a weak correlation between national size and tendency for belligerence. Some examples of "small" states that started significant wars: 

Other common possible choices might have been either the Prussian Thaler or the Bavarian Gulden. The marriage contract was likely denominated in the currency that was kept in hand by the bride's father, as in that way currency exchange would be minimized. If the bride's father was selling property in order to raise the dowry amount, he would have negotiated a currency choice matching that of the expected sale, again to minimize currency exchange. 

Thus far from being an appeasement of Frederick, Catherine's participation in the First Partition was a simple bloodless leverage of her recent victories against the Ottoman Turk. By the time of the Second and Third Partitions all eyes in Europe were on France as the major threat to the monarchies of Europe, not yet a Prussia under Frederick's successors. Update: (from comment above) Catherine the Great was Peter III's widow, and was widely regarded as the most Russian man (sic) in Russia. She most probably murdered her husband in order to end his fawning over Frederick the Great. Update 2: 

However not all schools of formal portraiture were in agreement, as witness the Dutch painters of the 17th century: 

Whiskey is the product of fermenting a barley mash, then distilling it and aging it in oak barrels. That is just as true now as in the 20th and 19th and 18th centuries. Yes, the scale of production is eased by modern automation and technology, but the scarcity of modern quality oak is as great a factor in the price of oak barrels as the reduced craftsmanship required in making them. 

If no battle was being fought the men would often siesta for 2 hours after the (light) mid-day meal, as the overnight sleep allowance was typically only 5.5 to 6 hours. Much of this routine was dictated by the fact that the infantry marched at nearly double the pace at which the supply trains could proceed, bearing in mind that the daily set-up and take-down of kitchens for 10,000 troops (typical division size) was a lengthy operation in and of itself, after which food for the same number of troops had to be prepared. Much of the cooking could occur overnight in order to supply each soldier with his daily (loaf of) bread, but the rest had to take place while there was daylight to see by. Note also that horses must spend several hours a day eating in order to stay fresh due to the low caloric density of pasture. Oats and other higher-density foodstuffs can be used as an occasional top-up, but will make the horses sick if over supplied. When a body of men went on a force-march it would forego the afternoon battle and foraging in order to make a second march of 6 or so hours through the heat of the afternoon, under full pack and with unreliable water supply. This would be facilitated when the troops were trained veterans; foodstuffs and water were reliably available; and the weather was accommodating (as in April 1809). The additional exertion would always lead to a higher rate of breakdown for men, horses and equipment; but for trained and well-supplied forces this was not overwhelming. Of much greater import to a commander was to minimize, over the entire length of a campaign, the amount of time that his force had to march through the heat of the hot summer afternoons, rather than to worry about a couple of days here and there of forced marching. 

This source provides a complete list of the RN's vessels in service in September 1939. It lists 113 Modern Destroyers, 68 Old Destroyers, and 54 Corvette Escorts (including 4 Australian and 2 Indian), for a total of 181 destroyers and 54 Escorts. An additional 24 Modern Destroyers were under construction. Additionally, the Royal Canadian Navy included 7 River-Class destroyers in 1939, and commissioned 1 additional River-Class and 8 Town-Class destroyers in September 1940 as pat of the WWII building program that would make it the Allies' third-largest navy, by number of vessels, in 1945. The Royal Australian Navy had the destroyers Stewart, Vampire, Vendetta, Voyageur and Waterhen in service in September 1939. The most frequent RN organization of destroyers appears to be this: 

McClellan's Peninsula strategy required the Army of the Potomac to execute better than the Confederate Army of Virginia in many ways; something that it was never able to do over the entire course of the war. Advancing on a narrow front with only two small attempts to truly leverage his overwhelming command of the waves, McClellan's advance was repeatedly blocked without difficulty by Lee, until his forces were exhausted. Perhaps a better army or commander might have made the strategy work, but the strategy itself required superiority in more than just numbers to work. To paraphrase a great commander of a half century earlier, McClellan "came on in the same old way, and was beaten back in the same old way." By way of contrast Grant truly leveraged his numerical superiority and tactical shortcomings by utilizing a much wider front of advance. Repeatedly pinning Lee with the bulk of his army, Grant could battle to a tactical draw, or even a small tactical loss, and continue sidestepping towards Richmond and St. Petersburg to force Lee into continued strategic retreats. Napoleon coined this strategy Manoeuvre sur les Derrières, and it was his favourite. B. H. Liddell Hart called it the Strategy of the Indirect Approach and on page 166 notes:
