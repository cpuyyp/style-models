You should resolve the problem that is causing the service to fail to start. If you need to tune how many times and how quickly systemd attempts to restart a failing service, see the , and options. 

The NAME part in a DNS answer section is formatted exactly the same as the QNAME part of the DNS question section. 

You should avoid such editors, or turn the smart quotes feature off, if the editor has such an option. Then edit the configuration file to remove the smart quotes and replace them with regular quotes. 

No, and it's not possible with any other monitoring system I'm aware of either. They simply download a URL and check it for specific headers or content. They do not support JavaScript. This is one of the many down sides of building a single page app purely in JavaScript with something like AngularJS. It's also the same reason why your page doesn't rank very well or show the results you want in Google. There are various ways of dealing with this in your application, all of which involve rendering the content server-side. You'll want to pick such a method and implement it. (Of course this doesn't take care of the users who disable JavaScript, an ever-growing number post-Snowden, and the only thing you can do there is throw out everything you've written and try again.) 

Given your requirements, I'd go with adding settings to (I presume you're using puppet, chef, or something similar). You will need to log the user out and stop gconfd (; it usually remains running for a few minutes after logout) to have settings changes take effect. 

No, you can't access VMs directly from the ESXi console. You can get the web address of its web client, which is how you'll need to manage your virtual machines, if you don't already have a vSphere client installed on your computer. 

You can't use extended page tables if virtualization is disabled, as this is an extension to virtualization (VT-x) in the first place. This particular Dell server ships with virtualization disabled in the BIOS. Check the BIOS settings under Processor Settings and enable virtualization. 

If you're using SELinux (by default you are) then you need to allow Apache to access user home directories: 

Ubuntu 12.04 is end of life, of course, but I do want to note that SPICE/QXL of that era was very early code, and on Ubuntu 12.04 in particular wasn't well integrated yet. They were still finding and fixing SPICE/QXL bugs causing slowness well past 2013. These days I don't think this question really applies anymore; SPICE is far faster than VNC for any version out in the last few years. 

Partition the new server's disk with an identically sized , swapspace, and new partition (and anything else you need). 

Of course, you should not be attempting to block these packets. It will cause applications to misbehave. 

Use the directive in , so that supervisord starts as root, does any necessary opening of files, and then drops privileges. 

That is verbose output from the utility for shrinking PNG images. You may suppress this output with the option. Though probably one of your gems is calling it and you have little control over whether it passes the option. 

Then, you will add a cookbook containing just this setup recipe to an Opsworks custom layer. The custom layer doesn't need to do anything else if all you want is to install the package. But since the custom layer lets you do a lot more, you might want to read Amazon's documentation and some other sample cookbooks that it links to, to get a sense of what you can do. 

This has nothing to do with SELinux (which you should not have disabled). You cannot start Apache as a regular user and bind to port 80. You must start it as root, and you should use the included systemd unit to do so. 

Standard input is not seekable, which is what qemu-img convert is trying to do here. To work around the problem, use an input image which is a file on the filesystem or a block device, both of which are seekable. 

It is not the function of DNS to rewrite your web application's URLs. You do this in the web server or in the web application itself. 

specified inside specifies only a default value for IP addresses which aren't in the database at all. So will always have country codes for whatever is present in the database. So here does nothing for you. To deal with this, use a in addition. 

Edit and replace all occurrences of with . Edit all files in the directory and apply the same replacement as above. If any of the above files have an Ubuntu code name other than , change them to as well. Edit and remove any pinning which you may have done. Finish the upgrade: 

OK, now we can see that in your your is wrong for three of the four repositories. The repos , and (which is disabled) all have a bad . Rather than pointing to the actual corresponding repo on your chosen mirror, they all point to the repo. You should find this very easy to fix. Just change the to point to the correct repo, according to the example already present in the file. After you fix this, you should again. 

The site you're trying to connect to is dual stack IPv4/IPv6, but your server doesn't yet have native IPv6 available. It's therefore trying to use an IPv6 tunnel, which is failing for whatever reason. To resolve the problem, disable IPv6 tunneling technologies (Teredo, 6to4 and ISATAP): 

Fortunately they have the lists available as plain text files that you can fetch from time to time and incorporate into a firewall-building script. 

OK, the previous answers have talked about why it's a bad idea to use fakeraid, why VMware doesn't support it, and to some extent why using a desktop motherboard isn't such a good idea. If you're really set on using this board as the base for a VMware server, this is what you do: 

Yes, there's a standard: Don't use X-Forwarded-For at all. RFC 7239 defines the Forwarded header, which has rather different semantics from X-Forwarded-For, and new implementations ought to be using it. Unfortunately it suffers from the same problem you have identified with X-Forwarded-For here: it may be defined twice in a request or contain a comma separated list of values. Proxies are also allowed to delete it entirely. And yes, there's a best practice: Use a different header name internally. Remember that X-Forwarded-For and its replacement Forwarded contain untrusted input. It is trivial for a client to put whatever they want in such a header. If you really need to know the public IP address of whatever connected to your server, stick it in a different header. For instance, CloudFlare uses CF-Connecting-IP for this purpose. I've also seen Client-IP and X-Real-IP used in nginx (where you can define anything you want). Whatever name is used, your load balancers should be sending the requester's IP address in some header other than X-Forwarded-For or Forwarded. 

This answer comes almost certainly too late to help the original poster, but perhaps it will help someone else. The problem is that that howto is plain wrong. To upgrade Fedora online using yum, follow Fedora's guide for doing so (if you like living dangerously). The process goes generally like this: 

The preferred option: Upgrade to Fedora 17 or Fedora 18 (which is being released a few days from now). Fedora 16 will be EOL'd a month after the release of Fedora 18. After upgrading, you can then install the package. Find the equivalent RPM for Fedora 16 and install it. If no such RPM exists, rebuild the package on your system from the source RPM. 

You have configured your system with repositories for both MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.0. This is not going to work; these packages cannot be run side-by-side on the same system. You will need to choose one or the other. Obviously since CentOS is already expecting to use MariaDB and for various other reasons, you should probably choose MariaDB rather than MySQL. 

You cannot install two different numbered versions of the i386 and x86_64 packages without causing a lot of breakage. Just install the same version of both packages. 

But, that is some terribly nasty hackery and probably not necessary, so before you do that, try having systemd restart nginx automatically if it stops. Do that with a systemd drop-in: 

Your FTP client trashed your files when you uploaded them. Be sure to set it to ASCII mode when uploading, or use SFTP. Or best of all, work directly on the server. 

Users can still change the desktop background color in Windows Server 2012. Note that you need to have Desktop Experience installed. You also have to allow users to change their colors and desktop background in Group Policy. The way I did this was: Open Control Panel. Under Appearance and Personalization, choose Change desktop background. 

Your old passwords are not stored in plain text. Instead, your old password hashes are stored in by PAM. It then makes the comparison when you go to change your password, based on what has been specified in the PAM configuration. An example PAM config: 

This requires a RADIUS server, which isn't too hard to set up, and the design completely prevents people sniffing the network at all. The RADIUS server can also be configured to allow only one device at a time to use any given account credentials, which deters account sharing. On the WPA2-Enterprise network, everything is encrypted and the attacker cannot decrypt anything from other users, as he can with WPA2-Personal if he knows the shared passphrase. And on the open network, only one single https web site is accessible, which also can't be sniffed, and MAC spoofing is pointless on that network. The only down side to this design is that it requires a one time configuration in advance for older computers running Windows 7 or earlier operating systems, but this takes only a minute to do.
