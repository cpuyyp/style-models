So now we are not comparing two rather confusing statements anymore, but we are comparing the clearly different statements 

According to Eysenck, fascists, racists, all kinds of -ists, can easily believe contradictory things about their victims. They can easily think that one group of people is too lazy to work, and trying to take our jobs away (and that's he says is the difference to the merely prejudiced who can believe bad things about people without evidence, but not contradictory things. And who also can be convinced by evidence that their prejudices are wrong, at least in specific cases). Convincing yourself of contradictory things is a lot easier when you want to believe both things. "Convincing" has to do with human psychology, not logic. For example, I'm one of the worlds best drivers, probably in the top 10%. On the other hand, the traffic in London is so awful, I would never get in and out of the town alive; I'm just not a good enough driver for that. Especially if you ask me to take you as a favour, and I don't really want to go. See, I can believe these two things simultaneously because one is good for my ego, and one stops me from paying for fuel. 

I think you misunderstand the meaning of "free will". You say "if you exercise free will in a deterministic universe" - well, you can't. You can make decisions that put you into a confrontation with the status quo. You can start a new job instead of staying in your old boring job. Or you can put up with your old boring job and continue doing it. It's not that the former is "exercising free will" and the second one isn't - if you have free will, then you can make either decision because you have free will. If you have no free will, then you can also make either decision, except that it wasn't free will, it was the totallity of your situation, of how you as an individual work, of all the little influences of the universe around you, that made that decision inevitable. Nobody knows whether people have free will or not. We do know that lots of people make very good decisions, and lots of people make decisions that are very bad for everyone including themselves. So either people make lots of good and bad decisions based on free will, or people make lots of good and bad decisions without having free will. 

The rebuttal is quite simple: 1. There is no god. 2. Therefore, your religion is based on an illusion, not reality. 3. Therefore, basing your morality on your religion which is based on an illusion is just ridiculous. The religious person might find that insulting, but then they started with the insults. Interestingly, when you say "They could, for instance, adhere to the ethical arguments about stealing being the correct and moral thing to do in cases of extreme inequality. ", well, that's what Josef Kardinal Frings, the archbishop of Cologne, said. And then "Or, in a more extreme case, justify killing other humans on the basis of their actions or beliefs.". That particular disease seems to be very common among some religious types, so anyone using that as an argument against atheism really needs their head examined. 

All three statements are true, but they don't have the same meaning. I'll try to make the difference more obvious by changing the left hand. 

III, "Some giraffes are cats" doesn't follow. Assume there are just two animals: Animal 1 is at the same time a cat, not a dog, a lion, not a mouse, not a giraffe. Animal 2 is at the same time a dog, not a cat, a lion, a mouse, and a giraffe. The statements about cats, lions, mice and giraffes are all true, but no giraffe is a cat. PS. Looks like the question has changed since this answer. With the question as it is now, "Some lions are mice" implies that there is at least one lion which is a mouse and therefore a giraffe, and as a consequence there is at least one mouse which is therefore a giraffe, so II and IV are true. There is no reason why any mice should be cats, and even less reason why any giraffes should be cats, so I and III are false. "All cats are lions" doesn't even imply the existence of a single cat! 

"Christmas trees are not carried by any pink elephants (in this area). Can you correctly infer that "there is at least one pink elephant (in this area)"? Your example is badly chosen, because (most likely) there are houses in that area, which leads you to incorrectly infer that their existence follows from the statement you gave. 

I can't really see this as a philosophical question, I would think of it as purely political. In any country there will be different kinds of people living together. Some people will, for whatever reasons, have enjoyed a less good education than others, with corresponding lower levels of literacy and numeracy. If this doesn't happen randomly but in some systematic way, then it might be that voting behaviour and literacy are correlated. Importantly, they are correlated: There is no reason to believe that lower literacy would lead to random voting behaviour, but it can lead to different voting behaviour. For example, someone with low literacy due to discrimination might want to vote against those responsible for discrimination and bad education for some groups, and for a party that might try to remove this injustice for future generations. It is therefore very likely that someone who claims that literary and numeracy tests should be introduced to get more "correct" election results is lying and what they really want is to exclude people from elections because of their voting preferences. In other words, instead of the claim that they want to improve democracy, they want to damage or destroy it. 

You seem to be mixing up things: Whether "true" randomness is possible, and whether computers are capable of producing "true" randomness. As far as the first question is concerned, computers are irrelevant, so I will ignore this. Computers can be and are capable of observing things that happen in the real world. If the real world can produce "true" randomness then computers can be built to observe that "true" randomness and repeat it back. You can decide for yourself if that would count as "true" randomness. If a dice throw were truly random, and I told you the number, would you consider the number I tell you to be random, or deterministic (depending on a random event)? I would call it random, so if true randomness is possible, computers can be capable of true randomness. Things in the real world can also be undistinguishable from true randomness. And computers can observe these things, and use their randomness. And then there is mathematically generated pseudo-randomness. If you start with some external random input, computers can very easily produce sequences of numbers that behave as if they were random. For some such methods, a sequence of random numbers could be analysed and the next random number predicted. But there are also "cryptographical" random number algorithms, where no feasible way to predict numbers is possible. Such a sequence is deterministic, but unpredictable. So at the very least, computers can produce numbers that are indistinguishable from "true" random numbers. 

Person 1 used initially an argument that relied not on any specific properties of what we call "universe" but only on the words in a sentence. Basically he said Everything in (X) (Y) therefore (X) must (Y) for the special case X = "universe" and Y = "has a cause". No reason was given why this would specifically apply to this X and Y. Therefore his argument can be refuted by giving an example where it does not apply. Person 2 proved the fallacy of the argument by demonstrating that the result of the argument is wrong in the case X = "wall" and Y = "is small". By giving the counter example Person 2 demonstrated that what Person 1 tried to use as a logical rule was not a valid logical rule. If Person 2 had claimed (which he didn't) that because walls are made of things that are small but are not small themselves, the universe which contains things having a cause cannot have a cause, pointing out that the universe is not a wall would be a valid refutation of that claim. But nobody made that claim. We could therefore say that Person 1 was using the "straw man" fallacy: Refuting a claim that actually nobody made. In reality, I'd say that Person 1 just didn't understand how Person 2's refutation worked. So his argument is probably just a non sequitur. Maybe this needs more explanation: P1 used without any justification an incorrect logical rule, to deduce a result that would be hard to prove or disprove ("the universe has a cause" is obviously hard to prove or disprove). P2 demonstrated that the logical rule was incorrect by giving a use of the exact same rule that leads to an obvious incorrect result. What P2 did was to demonstrate that P1 used a rule that wasn't generally correct. One could try to save some benefits of such a rule by finding conditions when it is correct to use. P1 didn't do this or even attempt to do this. One could try to demonstrate that a statement is correct without applying this rule. P1 didn't do this. Instead he just made the correct statement that "universe" is not "brick wall", probably trying to imply that therefore "universe" was not a counterexample disproving the validity of his logical rule, and probably trying to further imply that therefore his statement "the universe has a cause" was correct. And that is a non sequitur. Of course this doesn't follow. All that P1 has shown that P2 hasn't given a strong argument that "the universe has a cause" is false. But it was P1 who made a strong statement and therefore needs strong arguments to support this statement, which he doesn't have. Julian - the rule that P1 used is not a valid rule. Because it is not a valid rule, it cannot be validly used to argue anything. P2 demonstrated the invalidity of that rule. P1's next statement just produces a response of "so what"? So if the universe is not a brick wall, what does that have to do with the fact that P2 demonstrated that P1 was using an invalid rule? Nothing. Nothing of any interest follows from his statement. "The universe is not a brick wall" as a response has the same quality as "a boiled egg is not a brick wall" - it proves nothing. And that's what's called a non sequitur - a statement that proves nothing (especially not what someone is trying to prove). That's the correct term for his fallacy - a non sequitur.
