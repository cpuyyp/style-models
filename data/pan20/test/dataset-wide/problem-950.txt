Fishing through the links mentioned over at Christianity SE, I netted this scientific paper about freshwater and marine fish: Why are there so few fish in the sea?. Apparently the bulk (96%) of marine species have a single freshwater ancestor species extant 300 Mya (300 million years ago). Descendants of this species did not enter the ocean until about 180 Mya, with the greatest diversification and subsequent dominance of the oceans starting 110 Mya. Another fact: only 4% of current fish species can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater (e.g., salmon, trout, ...). To get anywhere near a hypothetical event equivalent to Noah's flood would require accepting dozens of counterfactual assumptions, and a total misunderstanding of geology, evolution, paleontology, not to mention conservation of mass (where did all the water come from?). But to address the narrow issue of survival of fish, one could imagine that the flood happened so rapidly as to create a very thick layer of freshwater on top of the saltwater. Freshwater is considerably lighter than saltwater, and would "float" on the saltwater. Marine mammals would be okay in freshwater for a few days. Then the waters could recede (where did all the water go to?), and maybe enough freshwater species would end up in the new freshwater lakes and streams. As far as the Ocean being less salty, there is no evidence for that. A lower salinity is postulated to fit into the theories of the Young Earth proponents. Paleosalinity is a complex study. You can browse through these references here and here. A flood such as this would have enormous, I would say overwhelming, geological, geographical, and paleontological evidence left behind, which in fact does not exist. But everything is possible with miracles.

It is mammatus. The individual cells are hanging down, but it just isn't very obvious from your perspective. Nice photo. Usually one doesn't have much time to photograph mammatus because of its inherently unstable condition. 

To be 100% sure one would need to study a thin section of the rock under a polarizing microscope. That said, however, I am 99.9% sure that this is a vesicular basalt in which large bubbles of volcanic gas have been frozen in as the lava rapidly solidified. I think your assumption that it is basalt is well founded. Under the microscope you would most likely find a mass of tiny interlocking crystals. The white laths would be plagioclase feldspar, whist the brownish / greenish or possibly grey crystals would be various types of pyroxenes. In most basalts these are two small to resolve with the naked eye. In addition there is likely interstitial glass, which froze before it had time to crystallize, and some opaque grains of magnetite. Some varieties of basalt will also have traces of other minerals. The white and brown minerals are late stage precipitates introduced by heavily mineralized ground-waters (common in volcanic environments). You can clearly see the hairline fractures through which the groundwater seeped, probably under considerable pressure. Note that if a bubble is not intersected by a hairline fracture then it is hydraulically isolated, in which case the bubble remains empty - no mineral deposition. You can see a few such examples in the photo. If the white crystals do not effervesce with acid, and are hard to scratch then they are almost certainly quartz. Otherwise they are most likely carbonates such as calcite, aragonite or dolomite (much more rarely hydroxy-carbonates). Iceland is well known for a range of zeolites (complex hydroxy-alumino-silicates) which characteristically infill the vesicles (gas bubbles). Most zeolites are rather more coarsely crystalline than the large pinkish precipitate, but one could not rule zeolites out as a possibility. As for cutting it in two, you would see more of the same. The larger vesicles / bubbles are more likely to intersect a fracture and be filled by any of the above late stage precipitates. There will be many smaller bubbles. If you carefully polish the cut surface, and examine it carefully with a hand lens you should be able to see the component crystals of the basalt. 

Beginning with the Primitive equations governing atmospheric motion for a dry gas, primarily the ideal gas law, and the conservation of mass and energy, neglecting diffusivity. $$P=\rho R T$$ $$\omega \equiv \frac{DP}{Dt}$$ Therefore $$\omega=R(\rho\frac{DT}{Dt}+T\frac{D\rho}{Dt})$$ Since $$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=-\rho \nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ and $$\frac{DT}{Dt}=\frac{\omega\rho}{c_p}+\frac{Q}{c_p}$$ $$\omega=R(\frac{\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{\rho Q}{c_p}-T\rho\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ Distributing $R$ and applying the ideal gas law $$\omega=\frac{R\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ Separating $\omega$ from the right hand side of the equation yields $$\omega=(1-\frac{R\rho^2}{c_p})^{-1}(\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ I call this semi-diagnostic, for $\omega$ is still a part of $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$ Is this a valid semi-diagnostic equation for $\omega$? 

Now there are plenty of limitations, such as the nonlinear version of that equation. If I had my notes on hand, then I could address those problems more. I'll edit this when I can. Also, model physics cannot be computed in spectral space, so there has to be conversion from spectral to physical space and vice-versa. I'll check my notes and correct any errors I can find later. 

If there is a quantity that varies in the atmosphere, there is inherently a gradient. Since you know there is a pressure and temperature gradient, there must also be a density gradient. There is also wind speed gradients, buoyancy gradients, wind shear gradients, isentropic gradients, vorticity gradients etc. let $\chi$ be a scalar quantity with the diagnostic equation: $$\frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla \chi=F(x,y,z,t)$$, where $\vec{v}$ is the wind vector, and $F$ is the forcing term (source-sink) Therefore $$\nabla \frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t} $$ and $$\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t}+\nabla \vec{v}\cdot\nabla\chi+\vec{v}\cdot\nabla(\nabla\chi)=\nabla F(x,y,z,t)$$ Therefore changes in the gradient of a quantity is dependent on the changes of the advection of the quantity and the changes in the forcing of the quantity. For example, an advancing cold front (effectively a moving thermal gradient) can be strengthened if the cold side is cooled/warm side is warmed, or the spacing decreases. 

In addition to all of the above there are meanders inn the Grand Canyon which are hydraulic outcomes of 'minimum energy flow configurations'. This constrains the discharge rates that are possible - to within the normal range of hydrologic discharges. Furthermore there are several places in the Grand Canyon where there is clear evidence of the river having been dammed by lava flows, over 13 volcanic episodes. These volcanics have been K-Ar dated at a variety of ages over the last few million years, with each lava dam taking between 10,000 and 20,000 years to erode. See, for example $URL$ and several other books and papers on the subject. 

Without water there would be no multi-billion year history of plate tectonics, no glacial action, and no fluvial erosion, so the Earth would look unrecognizably primitive. But we have an atmosphere, so all the impact crater rims would be subject to aeolian erosion whilst low points, including crater bowls, would have aeolian sedimentary infill. Volcanic activity would be much more obvious, and would also tend to obliterate craters, as it has in numerous other examples in the solar system. Earth would therefore appear as a rather muted, sediment-draped version of the moon. 

Atmospherically speaking, it would be incredibly hot. Considering a dry adiabatic atmosphere, it would be nearly 343 degrees Celsius (617.4 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter at the bottom than at the top. If we were to assume that it was a lapse rate of 6.5 degrees celsius per km, than the temperature would be more like 227.5 degrees celsius (409.5 degrees faherenheit) hotter. Plus, you need to start thinking about geothermal heating at that depth too. The other thing to keep in mind is that the pressure of the air would be very high too. Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height, so it would increase exponentially with decreasing height. Assuming STP for outside the hole with a dry adiabatic lapse rate, the pressure at the bottom would be around 1.92*10^20 hPa. The density of the air at the bottom would also be very high. 

Generally speaking, the types of data gathered outside a tornado can also be measured inside the tornado. Currently, forecasters try to estimate an area where tornadoes usually are. The forecasting time for tornadoes, or warn time, is about 13 minutes. There is still quite a bit we don't know about tornadoes, such as why some storms that look like they can produce a tornado, will not produce a tornado. Currently, most data taken about tornadoes is taken outside of the tornado. Data from inside the tornado, while uncommon, can give improved estimates of wind speeds, and pressure changes, with a level of detail that is hard to get from the outside, looking in. The models we deal with are imperfect- there are too many sources of error and It generally doesn't help the current predictions, but research on that data may help future predictions. 

Firstly I would disagree with your premise that 'most of Earth's sand contains tiny shells resembling sea shells'. Such biogenic sand is certainly true of some biologically productive sedimentary environments, but certainly far from all. For example, try finding shells in most of the sand in the Sahara desert, or any other desert for that matter. You will only succeed if the sand is reworked from previous biogenic sandstone. As to the resolution of shells at the apparent scale of your photograph, it depends upon the biota involved. The bioclasts vary from several millimetres to true microfossils - far below any visible resolution, and maybe even below resolution of small microscopes. I assume that any close up photo of Mars sand would have been magnified, contrast stretched, and computer image enhanced. Had there been any bioclastic grains, I am sure it would have been front page news around the world. 

This is very simple to explain when we consider that the 'model' you have been presented with is a gross oversimplification - a one dimensional mechanism. But the Earth is a multi-phase (air water ice), three dimensional system in which convective currents circulate. Hence there is a counterflow of both air and ocean currents in addition to the basic entropy model. The entire thermal circulation is also massively influenced by considerations of conservation of mass, conservation of energy, and conservation of angular momentum. Its a pretty complex system, as climate modellers are only too aware, and cannot be reduced to any simple model. 

A weed is just a plant where you do not want it. Totally a matter of context. Tumbleweeds are non-native, introduced centuries ago. I assume you mean the invasive species of plants that have been spread by humans and are disrupting ecologies throughout most of the world Until recently, these plants we consider weeds were limited in their range to home environments simply by geographic barriers and surrounding unfriendly environments. And the natural consumers, parasites and competitors in the home environments had adjusted to these plants and kept them in check. When non-native plants are introduced into a new environment by humans, most of them do not thrive, but occasionally a plant is wildly successful. Eventually the potential consumers, parasites and competitors in that new environment will adjust through evolution. But the tragedy is that many or most of the original species will be destroyed before that balance is restored in a new, way more simplified form. The landscape itself may be totally changed. Removal of a key original species can cause great change too: How Wolves Change Rivers. Not only will many ecologies be reduced to much simpler versions, even if they eventually conquer the invasive plant, those simplified ecologies will closely resemble each other, if their geography is similar, even if on the other side of the world. If humans were to totally stop transplanting invasive species (collapse of civilization?), diversity would return after millions of years. We know this from Extinction Events. So to answer you question, weeds before human intervention generally did not take over in their home environments because the potential weeds and their natural consumers, parasites and competitors all evolved together in a quasi-equilibrium. Now, however, most ecologies throughout the world are out of equilibrium because of environmental change and/or invasive species. This will inevitably lead to simplified, usually less robust, weedy ecologies throughout the world. That reduction in diversity might as well be considered a permanent situation compared to the timescale of civilization. 

Put simply, the coriolis 'force' doesn't change wind speed, but the direction the wind blows. I would say that the winds would become much faster. Consider these facts: 

This may/may not actually answer your question "Do warnings verify better" because of the qualitative word "better" and other factors that play a role, such as terrain and forecasting office. Another factor to consider is the nature of the warning and size of the phenomenon. A radar, for example, may not be the best tool to show verification of a hurricane, but it may be better for verification of a tornado. I hope to answer your question by taking arguments to the extreme. If warnings verify more and more accurately as the warnings get closer to the radar, they may end up in the "cone of silence," where the angle of the radar would not be able to capture the phenomenon. The opposite of that statement would be that warnings are more accurate the farther away the phenomenon is from the radar. This is also absurd, not only is resolution of the radar cut, but the curvature of the earth also makes this idea absurd. Conclusion: there is some middle ground. If you get to close, you may not only be endangering your radar (depending on the phenomenon) but you may miss data. It also matters what angle your scan is at. I would hypothesize that anything within the highest elevation angle of the radar would have the highest accuracy, but it would really matter what the phenomenon warned is and what size the phenomenon is. Warning zones are issued by people, and people have flaws. I would hypothesize that your results may not be conclusive, since the habits of each WFO may vary. For example, a winter storm warning in Georgia is an inch of snow and ice, while Boston would need 6 inches of snow to issue a winter weather watch. Some areas see tornadoes more often than others, leading to some inherent biases, etc. 

In fact, we have a saying here where I am in Minnesota (USA) that it can be "too cold to snow". Our greatest snowfall is in March, early spring, when temps are right around freezing. It snow very very little in central Antarctica, the coldest part of the Earth. 

Being remote sensing, algorithms for inverting the raw data to get physical quantities may be improving with time. Perhaps a slight adjustment in algorithm or calibration happened between July and Sept of this year. However you would expect this to introduce a systematic adjustment, not a scatter. One might reasonably wonder why the data is steady before 1999. That may be because there were fewer (or different) remote sensor parameters measured then, or the data wasn't as precise. Another possibility is that the calculation was simply done more precisely, and you are looking at the elimination of round off errors, or different round offs. 

Gordon has an excellent answer to one version of your Q. In case you are asking a more basic Q, here is a try at an answer. Vini, think about the monsoons. Cooling the soggy parcel of air causes rain, but continued gradual cooling as it crosses an area of land does not necessarily create even heavier rain (leaving aside the rapid cooling that happens when it is pushed up a mountain). The parcel is dried out as it cools, so by the time it hits higher cooler land, it does not have that much precipitation to give. 

This is physics rather than Earth Sciences, but differential pressure between tinned liquid and atmosphere is by far the dominant factor. In Scotland I remember opening a can of 7-up at sea level with almost no effervescence. Then I climbed Ben Nevis, 1344 metres, and celebrated reaching the summit with another can. The resulting 'geysir' ejected about half the can in spectacular fashion. Temperature also has an effect in that the solubility of CO2 on a cold day, say 10 deg C, is about 30% more than on a hot day of ~30 deg C. So if the outside temperature is warmer than at the time the drink was canned, then there will be an excess of free gas that has come out of solution, but is still in the can waiting to be released. If we say two grams of excess CO2 in the can, that will yield about a litre of gas at one atmosphere and 21 deg C. I'm wondering what the effect of a high sugar content would be. Could large organic molecules act as foci for gas bubble formation? Maybe a fun school experiment! 

The sun is about 100 times the size of the Earth (in diameter), and the distance from the sun to Earth is about 100 times the diameter of the sun. Below is an image showing the sun, Earth, and the distance between them to scale. It looks at first like nothing more than a black bar. This image in the original is 4000 pixels (the limit of my Pixlr Editor) by 60 pixels, and Earth is less than a pixel. To see it full size, click here or on the image, then when it comes up in your web browser click on it again to magnify it to full size. Use your scroll bar to see the sun at one end and Earth at the other. You will need to look really closely to see Earth. 

Snow is just another type of precipitation. Like with rain, it occurs when somewhere in the air column the relative humidity humidity goes over 100% and the is at least some dust for nucleation. The history of the air matters. That very cold air in Norway had to travel there from somewhere warmer and more humid, perhaps even through Germany. As it traveled to Finland, it became colder and produced snow, drying it out, so by the time it got there it had very little water vapor to turn into snow.
