disclaimer: I don't own the pictures that I have posted here, I got them through ann internet search, and I have added them here for educational purposes only, and for my own personal reference as they show the muscles involved and motivate me. 

there is an exercise called one arm dumbbell bent over row. sometimes I like doing 10 sets of 10 reps alternating arms of this exercise with 60 Kg. It makes me feel very good, and after 24 hours or more, I feel my back muscles when I contract my back. question: I do back twice a week, one of them I do only the exercise described above. would this cause injury? would this make me stronger on this exercise? what type of muscle development can be expected? 

Taking the biceps as an example, this muscle has about 200 of these motor units to stimulate all the muscle fibers. But you want to contract your muscle, they don't all go fire at the same time. This is due to the size principle, motor units of the smallest size will be recruited first. For a more detailed explanation, I can recommend Human Physiology: The Mechanism of Body Function 

Safety first, if you want to learn to swim (as an adult), make sure you try it in a swimming pool where you can easily stand up if things go wrong and have supervision around in case of an emergency. As someone who has learned several children to swim, I'd say its pretty hard to learn it yourself properly. Why? Because you can read the words, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to correct yourself if you do something wrong. But if you really put your mind to it, I do think it can be done. The usual order of learning to swim goes sort of like this: 

Here and here you can see me bench press 200 Kg. I don't bench 200Kg 440 Lbs all year long. After reaching the 200, it goes down gradually back to 160 and then 160 for 2 reps and slowly up. I use several paths in achieving that but the most common is 10 sets of 1-2 reps. My question here today is related to an injure that happens sometimes. I am currently doing 2 reps on 180 Kg. I did this on sunday, but after benching I went doing some chest flies which I normally do. I hurt my chest tendon, so today I am still feeling it. 

I have recently changed the bench press position from "bodybuilder" to "powerlifter" because of inflammation and pain on my chest tendon. This has really helped a lot the chest tendon, but it takes some time to get used to it. what can I do to maintain this level of training with the possibility in due course to try new PBs (personal bests) once in a while? I asked my doctor, he says the chest tendon can snap without a warning when submitted to heavy weights. I take vitamins and supplements, try not to get too stressed at work, try to have minimum sleep, I am vegetarian, and try to keep a good diet (though I am a bit on the overweight side now). 

Also you should remember that intensive exercising effects your entire body: your heart is pumping, your lungs are ventilating, your blood is racing through your body, your muscles are contracting, your liver is producing energy. If you were to suddenly stop, your body will slightly lag behind your abrupt change in exercise intensity (or the lack thereof). When you've been working out near the lactate threshold, your body has also been piling some amount of lactate. If you lower the intensity of your workout, such that you get enough oxygen, your muscles will start using lactate as a fuel and get rid of it. Because burning lactate creates a lot of waste products like CO2 and creatine kinase, it's advisable to keep up some level of activity, so that your body can get rid of it easily. During workouts, your body releases hormones such as adrenaline and endorphins, if you were to abruptly stop exercising, you maintain higher levels of these hormones which can cause a feeling of restlessness or a sleepless night. Another good reason is that when you exercise, your muscles stretch and shorten a lot. If you were to stop abruptly, you leave your muscles in a somewhat misaligned state. By cooling down, you gradually limit the range of motion back to the state it would be in when you're in rest. So basically, the goal of cooling down is giving your body time to readjust itself to the change in requirements. However, a study by Law and Herbert from the university of Sydney indicated that cooling down did not reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness. Which might indicate that this isn't directly related to residual waste products. Furthermore, Tanaka, an exercise physiologist from the University of Texas claims it's an understudied topic and that there's no science behind the advice. I'd like to point out that my while my answer is based on the physiological processes going on during exercise, I don't have any publications to back them up. Lucky for me, neither has he. 

$URL$ I like to think of it this way: Resistance training strengthens your arms, legs, etc. and Cardio strengthens your heart; which is really more important if you think about it. If you have a low calorie diet without any exercise you will likely loose muscle mass due to your body burning protien (muscle) as well as fat. If you do at least some moderate exercise it will keep your body from feeding off muscles (which may include the heart!) 

You can really work out as many days per week and you want. Any specific recommendations on how much and often will depend on your goals. 

Is it really necessary to do Creatine Loading when first starting to take it? Or, doesn't it really matter? 

I have Adidas micoach Pacer and plan to do start a marathon program. But first I want to do an assessment workout, to make sure I have my Pacer uses the right zone settings. 

If you're trying to work out on your maximum lung capacity, you have to subtract a part of your oxygen supply for the oxygen debt, so you're not working out maximally anymore: you're simply out of breath. Furthermore, if you can't supply your muscles with sufficient oxygen, it will anaerobically burn it's fuels. While they're a great fuel, it won't last you very long and it will most likely hamper the amount of repetitions you can make with the same fuel. Because as soon as you rest, then the fuel get's processed again, but you already moved on to another muscle group... If your body feels tired, your central nervous system (CNS) might also inhibit any further exercise. It won't stop you from trying, but you probably won't be able to perform the amount of reps you could perform with sufficient rest. So all in all, even if you were to switch muscle groups: your body needs some rest between repetitions. How much rest your body needs depends on: how heavy the exercise is, how fast your performing it and how many times you perform it per repetition. 

Red meats such as Steak and Salmon do contain some creatine and provide a natural source. However, much of the creatine is destroyed from the heat as a result of cooking the meat. At what temperature is the creatine destroyed? Can you cook steak medium and still have creatine, or does it need to be rare? Also, when cooking salmon, does the creatine get destroyed if you cook the internal temperature of the meat to 140F as recommended? I am pretty much wondering how practical it is to actually get a little extra creatine from eating red meats. Links to sources would be greatly appreciated. 

I have read that Creatine must be taken with juice, such as Grape juice, because the sugars help it get absorbed by the body. Is this true? Also, what time is it best to take Creatine? Before or After working out? First thing in the morning? Also, what cycling interval should be used? Is 8 weeks on, 4 weeks off, ok? Or is 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off better? 

On average I burn about 1-1.1 kcal / minute, which is pretty low given that my 2hr run yesterday burned an average of 12 kcal/minute. So while your mileage may vary, I'd probably burn somewhere between 60 and 90 kcal/hour regardless on what I'm sitting. To get 45 kcal more, you'd probably need to be in some very unbalanced position. 

While drawing diagrams to calculate it would be fun, have you considered comparing your heart rate with and without the stroller? That would be a much more reliable than trying to estimate the increased energy requirements. Here's why: 

You could also try to focus on swimming faster for longer stretches of time. An often used method for this is using a 'pyramid' built up. It basically goes like: 100m --> 200m --> 300m --> 400m --> 300m --> 200m --> 100m Which totals in 1600m (not bad!) + 400m of your warming up. Swim each interval as fast as possible (under the lactate threshold), but try to keep up a constant pace rather than ending very slow. This teaches you to spread your efforts when the workout starts to become longer and will help you find a pace of breathing and stroking that you can keep up for longer stretches of time. You can use the same protocol as with the 100m workouts, if you aim for 1:45 min with rest, just multiple that for every 100m you swim. This means your need to swim the 400m within 7 minutes and you get the rest of the time to rest. You can shorten your 100m time, but you can also switch the resting for swimming 50m backstroke. This gives you less rest, but you don't have to push yourself to swim much faster (which is often much harder!). Alternatively, you could do a medley, where you combine all strokes. The recommended order is: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, because it has a good mix of intensity and 'rest'. So my advice: always swim freestyle unless you want some variation or rest. 

I rested for about 3 weeks, then started doing some cardio (on an elliptical) daily for a week. Yesterday I started working out again and things seem to be moving forward again. I just need to make sure I don't overwork my lower back muscles again. It just took some time of rest to heal. 

When refrigerated, I would expect it to last at least 48 hours. If not refrigerated, I would suspect that you wouldn't want to leave it sit at room temperature for more than a few hours. For lunch, you could try freezing it overnight and taking it out in the morning, then it should stay mostly cold until lunch time. Although, @Salsero69 's suggestion of measuring the powder then mixing when needed is probably the best solution. 

Disclaimer: I specialize in gait analysis, so obviously I'm heavily biased. What are your options for footwear? 

Standing up and walking isn't really considered fidgeting, so yes, the subjects consumed up to 350 kcal/day more, but not by wiggling their feet or rocking a pen (the definition of fidgeting). As a comparison, let's compare how many calories I'd burn sitting down vs standing using this online calculator: 

To understand how these two sports might conflict, we need to delve deeper into how muscles are controlled. Chad Waterbury had this nice picture showing how a motor unit touches several muscle fibres. I suggest those who don't know what motor units are start reading up a little bit :-) 

There's another reason why you need to work out longer: fat is a slow fuel and your body doesn't really start to burn fat until you're 30 minutes into a workout. Luckily, nobody said you had to workout hard to get to this point, so I'd advise you to use a long, relaxing 'warming up' just to get your metabolism going and then get going with the real deal. So basically: no, you don't need to go out and buy anything else! But if you like some variation, I'd really recommend you to start running outdoors instead. Running does become heavier 'naturally' when you increase your speed and it's generally more pleasant to workout outdoors as well.
