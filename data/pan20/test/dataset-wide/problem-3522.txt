Perhaps another way to put this is to ask, is there a stock price at which you would buy shares even if you could never sell them or borrow against them? I say generally speaking yes. Dividend yields are about 2.1 percent. If equity prices fell 80% you could make so much money off they dividends that you'd make more than the historical return on equities from the dividends alone. But in practice, you can borrow against your shares and you can sell them, so you don't need prices to fall nearly as far to be a good value. Unfortunately, and I think you understand this, equities prices generally go down when economic prospects are poor, and so low prices are a negative wealth shock more than a buying opportunity. 

Nobody gains from dollar cost averaging analytical, numerical and empirical results (Knight and Mandell (1993)) 

First, I thought it was tautological that global net exports had to be zero. Is Mueller's claim correct? Does it turn on a technicality of the definition of net exports? Please help me understand his position. Second, is it accurate to characterize gold standard monetary policy as counter-cyclical? My understanding is that recessions in the gold standard era were marked by deflation where as in the fiat currency era recessions are merely dis-inflationary. If so, is it fair to call the gold standard substantially less counter-cyclical than fiat currency systems? 

If, as @GraemeWalsh suggests, you would like to use an auto-regressive distributed lags methodology (ARDL) you can do so without having to code it up yourself. 

The equity premium: A puzzle (Mehra and Prescott (1985)) lays out the basic problem with equity returns: 

If you define the category wide enough (say two, durable and non-durable consumption), everyone does likely does consume something in every category and maybe in close to fixed proportions. For certain important forms of consumption like cars and house, adjustment costs and indivisibility may make households face very different prices.

Game Theory in the Talmud by Robert J. Aumann discusses a bankruptcy problem and a variety of fair division problems of a contested sum from the Talmud, a document written roughly between 200 and 500 CE. For example:

In general, no. The procyclicality of wages can also It could also be a measure of labor market frictions instead of the level of competition. For an example that highlights the difference, consider an economy where only union electricians can do electrical work and where the union controls the members and their hours. If the union can frequently and costlessly adjust their total labor supply, then they don't have a lot of friction in their supply but they (by construction) have limited competition through their monopoly labor supply. On the other hand, laws mandated costly separation processes for employees such as 2 years severance or, more extremely, lifetime employment make it very difficult to adjust the quantity of labor supplied but this isn't exactly a competition issue. There could be many employees, many employers, and no licensing restrictions and yet this could still significantly dampen the cyclicality of the real wage by making employment not adjust to cyclical productivity shocks. This might be somewhat splitting hairs because both restrict the adjustment of labor demanded but conceptually they are quite different. Additionally, there may be reasons related to other features of the economy or the way that the data is gathered for wages to be less procyclical in one place than another. For example, measurement error attenuates statistical relationships towards zero so in two otherwise identical countries, if one has wage measured with more error then the correlation between wage and your favorite business cycle measure will be shrunk towards zero in that country relative to the truth. 

Take any utility function $f(x)$. Just because $x\geq0$ doesn't mean $f(x)>0$. There are plenty (infinitely many) of utility functions that are sometime negative and sometimes positive. Consider one $U = x-5$ This is person has exactly the same preference ordering as someone with preferences $U = x-10$, $U = x$, and $U = x+5$. Now imagine multiplying these utility functions by x. This makes the negative utility values positive at different values of x. We can tell that because the utility functions have the same ordering of the utility values of x.

Intertemporal consumption smoothing is using savings or borrowing to make consumption less volatile than income (or sometimes wealth). The intertemporal consumption smoothing motive can arise in many settings, but an early and famous example is the Milton Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis. The idea is that if income contains permanent and temporary shocks then maximizing the NPV of lifetime utility will make you ignore temporary shocks and consume a fixed fraction of your permanent income. Essentially, you know temporary shocks are temporary. If you cut back on consumption in the face of these temporary shocks you'd end up with consumption that is higher than average in better times. Because of declining marginal utility of consumption this is a worse consumption plan than keeping your consumption fixed in good times and bad. In contrast, if you experience a permanent negative shock to consumption there won't (in expectation) be a good time to make up for the lost income. Leaving your consumption unchanged in the present would therefore require even larger cutbacks in the future. This is a worse consumption plan than cutting your consumption immediately and using that new and lower plan going forward. 

No, many countries do not. For example. the United States does not have a VAT. According to the paper The Consequences of the Value-Added Tax on Inequality in Developing Countries (Alavuotunki and Pirttilä (2015)) here is an extensive list: 

This is a very broad question and maybe primarily opinion based too. But yes, at least for some definitions it does it exist. One possible definition of fair is envy-free. That is, you wouldn't want to switch your allocation with anyone else. If you have a last piece of cake and you have to share it with another, there is a whole class of algorithms that deliver envy-free division of the cake. The most famous member of this class of algorithms is the "divide and choose protocol" which is in active use around the world and has existed since biblical times (at least). 

Strictly speaking, infinitely different utility functions can give the same preferences over lotteries. If person A has utility function $f(x)$ then person B with utility function $g(x)=A+B\cdot f(x)$, $B>0$ will make identical decisions over all lotteries. There would be no way to know which individual was actually using utility function $f(x)$ and which was using $g(x)$ because they would always make the same decisions. 

@Henry gives a good answer with lots of interesting reasons. However, there are lots macro-model setting where the demand for risk free assets is positive, even when the interest on savings is negative. Essentially, because risk is unpleasant and we don't have any good alternative technology to the market for risk-less assets to move our savings through time, risk adverse entities will generally have a positive quantity of the risk-free asset regardless of the interest rate. And, to some extent, this meshes with our intuition about how savings works. The poor medieval farmer puts away ("saves") food in the summer for winter knowing that much of it will spoil and there certainly won't be any more than he puts in ("negative interest") but because he doesn't have a bank or because agricultural prices are higher in the winter, he can't simply sell all his produce today, save the money, and buy the food later. In fact, if you have log-utility preferences the income and substitution effects cancel (see for example Jones chapter 20) and no change in interest rates up or down changes the consumption and savings decision. 

While advertising can be zero sum, here are two additional dimensions you might want to consider. Billboards, like other forms of advertising, can inform. In this way Ford can talk about their new 8 seat minivan while GM talks about the more fuel efficient engine of their latest model. This can result in happier customers who value their product better and are willing to pay higher prices for this more ideal product. Billboards, in ways not paralleled by other most other forms of advertising, have a negative externality akin to pollution. When the NY Times decides to increase their number of advertisements slightly they bear the costs in customer unhappiness, giving them an incentive to adjust until the private costs and benefits of a marginal ad are equated. But not so with the billboard. The billboard is typically adjacent to public space, so if a nasty billboard ruins the scenery or obscures another billboard the billboard owner doesn't internalize those costs. Since the private benefits of ad revenue continue to accrue to the owner, this leads to too many billboards even if some level of billboard production would be socially desirable. 

Consider the risk free steady state. In that situation the Euler equation becomes: $$ \left(\frac{C_{t+1}-b \overline{C_{t}}}{C_t-b \overline{C_{t-1}}}\right)^{-\sigma}=\frac{1}{\beta \cdot (1+r)}$$ Which implies $$ \Rightarrow \ln[C_{t+1}-b \overline{C_{t}}] -\ln[C_t-b \overline{C_{t-1}}] = \frac{\ln[\beta] + \ln[1+r]}{\sigma}$$ Assume that in the non-stochastic setting that growth is constant of the form: $$ C_{t+1} = \gamma \cdot C_{t}$$ Note that by definition $$ \overline{C_{t}} \equiv \frac{1}{t}\sum^t_{\tau=1} C_{\tau}$$ Under a constant growth rate $$ \Rightarrow \overline{C_{t}}=\frac{1}{t}\sum^t_{\tau=1} \gamma^{\tau-t}C_{t} = \frac{C_t}{t} (1+\frac{1}{\gamma-1}) = \frac{C_t}{t} (\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1})$$ $$ \Rightarrow \overline{C_{t+1}}= \frac{C_{t+1}}{t} (\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}) = \gamma \frac{C_{t}}{t} (\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}) = \gamma \overline{C_{t}}$$ $$ \Rightarrow \frac{\ln[\beta] + \ln[1+r]}{\sigma} = \ln[C_{t+1}-b \overline{C_{t}}] -\ln[C_t-b \overline{C_{t-1}}] $$ $$ = \ln[\gamma C_{t}-b \gamma \overline{C_{t-1}}] -\ln[C_t-b \overline{C_{t-1}}] = \ln[\gamma]$$ Therefore the one period growth rate in consumption ($\gamma$) in the non-stochastic model is $$ \gamma = e^{\frac{\ln[\beta] + \ln[1+r]}{\sigma}} = [\beta(1+r)]^\sigma$$ 

Etymology and Introduction As a concept to measure the interchangeability of assets and money, liquidity is a new word. It first appears in 1923 in a use by Hawtrey (The Oxford English Dictionary (1989)). The underlying idea however is much older. Menger (1892) calls a good more or less saleable according to the facility to which it can be disposed of at current purchasing prices with less or more diminution. He is talking about the origin of money, and not the disposition of financial assets, but this concept of saleability is very much like the modern concept of liquidity. This sense of saleability goes back at least as far as Jehan Palsgrave's usage in 1530 (The Oxford English Dictionary (1989)). Although the absence of liquidity is now commonly referred to as "illiquidity", Marschak (1938) offers "frozen" as an alternative that did not catch on. Hicks (1962) says that the use of the word liquidity in a financial sense was popularized by Keynes and the Macmillan Report in the 1930's (Macmillan Committee of HMSO (1931)). In The General Theory, Keynes says that liquidity justifies money trading at a premium over bills or bonds and causes the existence of an interest rate. Hicks teases from Keynes' Treaty on Money (Keynes (1930)) that one calls an asset more liquid than another if it is "more certainly realizable at short notice without loss." This quote is more ambiguous than it may seem at first glance. Hicks offers several interpretations. The first, which he flatly rejects, define liquidity as the difference between the price the owner carries on his books for an asset and the price they could sell it for on the market. The second, is an interpretation of marketability. Hicks defines a security as marketable if it is sold just as well after negotiation, search and advertising as it is without it. That is, we can compare the liquidity of two assets by the relative sacrifice one makes from a rapid sale. He claims this interpretation is "more appealing" but still not what Keynes meant. He understands Keynes's definition of liquidity to require perfect marketability, but even perfectly marketable assets can be more or less liquid. The difference here is in the moments of the asset's price. Among marketable financial assets, we can regard them as more or less liquid by using a utility function to manage the trade-offs between maximizing the desirable odd moments (e.g., positive mean and skew) and minimizing undesirable even moments (e.g., variance and leptokurtosis) of asset returns. Definitions of Liquidity A treatment of market liquidity is critical if we are to realistically model the behavior of markets of financial assets that are traded with transaction costs. The liquidity literature primarily follows three meanings of liquidity. The first and oldest class of measures of liquidity relate the size of loss to the amount of notice. That is, what is the fraction of the best possible price that a seller can net as a function of time allotted to conduct a loss minimizing sale? Keynes's definition is a specific example where he is interested only in short notice. For example, compare trying to sell a round lot (100 shares) of IBM stock today with doing the same with a home. The IBM shares will sell without diminution. The home will sell at an enormous discount because of product heterogeneity, heterogeneous buyers, and the skipping of time consuming risk avoidance techniques (e.g., title search and property inspection). A classic statement of this sense of liquidity comes from Hirshleifer (1968). He calls liquidity "as asset's capability over time of being realized in the form of funds available for immediate consumption or reinvestment -- proximately in the form of money." Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) also care about liquidity in this first sense. They see exogenous liquidity events (say a change in margin requirements) causing a "demand for immediacy" (a term also found in Grossman and Miller (1988)), that is, the willingness to sell rather than wait when doing so costs the seller. According to Greenbaum (1971), who called this the L1 definition of liquidity, the earliest work on this sense of liquidity was in Tobin's unpublished manuscript. Pierce (1966) elaborates this notion and explores this measure in the context of commercial bank portfolio management. The second meaning understands liquidity as the expected time to sale without diminution. Returning again to the example of selling the lot of IBM stock and a home, the expected time to getting the best price on your shares of IBM is almost zero (at least during business hours and with access to a computer or phone) whereas, on average, the home would take a few months to sell optimally. Lippman and McCall (1986) explore this sense of liquidity. They take an agent as choosing a stopping rule $\tau^* \in T$ of all possible stopping rules to maximize expected net receipts (under that stopping rule) of $E [R(\tau^*)]$. They define liquidity as $E [\tau^*]$, the expected time to sale under the optimal stopping rule. Krainer and LeRoy (2002) also suggest this expected time to sale under an optimal selling rule a measure of liquidity. The third definition of liquidity involves the uncertainty of an asset's value. As discussed above, Hicks (1962) sees this as the critical attribute of liquid assets. Proponents of this definition argue that it is of little importance if you can sell an asset on short notice and with small loss if the asset itself is worth little when you need it. That is reasonable as long as investors are risk averse. Tobin (1958) introduces this sense of liquidity in a framework of risk averse investors and uncertainty of future interest rates. Tobin's paper resolved the paradox (to economists) that consoles (perpetual bonds) have higher expected rates of return than cash investments. Lagos (2008) is able to explain much of the risk-free-rate and equity-premium puzzles in an economy with riskless, liquid assets and risky, illiquid ones when agents hold assets for the liquidity services. Deaton (1991) equates a model's liquidity constraints with limitations on borrowing future income. In that sense, liquid assets are more effective in moving income though time. Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) also explore this meaning of liquidity as a way of storing wealth between periods in search of recommendations for efficient market making of financial assets and optimal provision of liquidity services by the government. Hovakimian, Opler, and Titman (2001) continue to explore this inter-temporal liquidity concept in economies with human capital that creditors cannot seize or make claims upon. He experiments with two an extra features, either no short selling of physical capital or limited borrowing by agents. The concept of liquidity is a mixture of the attributes of liquidity discussed above. Households without liquid assets want to borrow with their illiquid assets as collateral. They cannot do so. Creditors are unwilling to lend because in the event of default, lenders will have to sell collateral with serious discount from the true value, with long waiting times for finding a good selling price, or with unfavorable co-movement (e.g., covariance or other forms of joint distribution) with other asset holdings. This idea of liquidity as having wealth when you need it is similar to the CAPM insight of weighting future returns by the marginal utility. Krainer and LeRoy (2002) argue that the CAPM holds for illiquid assets as well as liquid ones, but that observing the relevant shadow prices is difficult. However, the ambiguity of asset values in the presence of illiquidity (explored later) ensures that these shadow prices will not be unique. The general idea is that illiquidity can drive a a wedge between the discounted expected risk adjusted returns and the price for which you can sell an asset. As such, the traditional CAPM model is not entirely appropriate. An area for future investigation is expanding the CAPM to make this distinction. Holmstrom and Tirole (2001) was one attempt to so, but focused on firm decisions and not investor valuations. Can the Alternative Definitions of Liquidity be Reconciled? Here is an example of the wedge between expected returns and price that also highlights that an asset can be liquid in one sense and yet is illiquid in another. Imagine an investor with a US Treasury bond with a 14% coupon in a market where newly issued bonds have a coupon of 7%. Selling these highly appreciated bonds (which traded far above par) would require paying significant capital gains taxes, while holding them involves minimal credit risk and the interest would be state and local tax exempt. Therefore, to sell would be expensive for the owner and therefore illiquid in sense 1. Nevertheless, these securities could surely be sold rapidly though the secondary US Treasury Bond market and there would be little benefit to waiting and therefore highly liquid in sense 2. It is certainly the case that assets that are liquid in one sense are often liquid in the others too. But as this example shows, that need not be so. Therefore we cannot collapse these three definitions into a single numerical measure of liquidity capturing all the desired attributes. Even if we could, Hicks (1962) and Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) have concluded that liquidity is an ordinal property. Marschak (1938) suggests measuring the distinct properties of liquidity separately. Pierce (1966) disagrees that such an ordering is possible, at least with respect to sense 1 of liquidity. He says that "apart from those assets that are perfectly liquid and those for which sale prior to maturity is impossible, assets cannot be uniquely ranked by degrees of liquidity." His example is an asset A that is easy to sell well with short searches (but no better after long ones) and an asset B that sells more poorly than A for short searches and better than A for long ones. Pierce also notes (in describing the weakness of his notion of liquidity) that "the price per unit often depends on the number of units sold." This allows for another example of the crossing behavior, where one asset may be more liquid at small quantities but less liquid for large ones. Admati and Pfleiderer (1988) argue that liquidity of the third type actually encourages liquidity of the first type. They argue that commodities with successful futures markets have demand for immediacy because price volatility and risks of delaying sales are large (illiquid in sense 3). Such markets also help spread the fixed costs of market making (waiting around for buyers and sellers to want to trade, as well as infrastructure) across a large number of market participants. In contrast, home sellers are less concerned with short-term price volatility and instead prefer an extended search for potential buyers. Alternative Definitions Krainer and LeRoy (2002) argue that liquidity is a feature of markets and not of assets. They offer as a first example that a Ford automotive factory is illiquid but Ford stock is liquid. A second example is a pool of mortgages which is more illiquid than than the underlying mortgages. However, perhaps it suffices to refer to an asset's liquidity as its liquidity in the most liquid market an agent can trade it in. Tobin calls reversibility "the value of the asset to its holder expressed as a percentage of is contemporaneous cost to the buyer" (Tobin and Golub (1998)). Hahn (1990) sees asset liquidity as being closely related "to the cost reversing a decision taken earlier." His example is that for economic agents, the cost of selling an asset in period 2 will factor into the decision to invest in it in period 1. This meaning of reversibility is a mixture of sense 1 and sense 2 of liquidity. If waiting for suitable trading opportunities is the expensive part of reversing a trade then reversibility is primarily the second sense of liquidity. However, if transaction costs are the expensive part of reversal then the first sense of liquidity will be the relevant one. Marschak (1938) develops a concept of plasticity that is essentially this concept of reversibility. He considers plasticity as a more general concept than saleability that includes flexibility. Greenbaum (1971) is an early reference that notes the interrelatedness of reversibility and liquidity. Jones and Ostroy (1984) see an essential attribute of liquidity in the related measure of flexibility. Financial investments that leave agents with a larger set of intermediate and final choices are more flexible. Lippman and McCall (1986) are similarly interested in liquidity as flexibility. They show in a simple search model that if the investor opportunity set changes over time, even risk neutral investors will demand a more liquid asset because it improves the expected returns of their portfolio. Hahn (1990) also sees liquidity as tied to the "speed of response to new information," but it is hard to see if this is a cause of liquidity or caused by it. Intuition suggests the former. Few market participants, high transaction costs and other direct causes of illiquid markets all make it more difficult to trade on new information. Further, the trees model of Lucas (1978) shows that prices can move even in the absence of trade. Frequent trade is not synonymous with liquidity. The frequency of order arrival is a determining factor of liquidity in markets with market makers. This implies that markets need not be liquid to have fast adjusting prices. Flexibility can be about more than investment opportunities. If agents are borrowing constrained and goods can be purchased only with liquid assets, then agents must hold some liquid assets to purchase goods for immediate consumption, even though doing so does not maximize their portfolio return. If consumption opportunities vary over time then agents will hold relatively more ready assets to take advantage of fleeting consumption opportunities. If agents were not so constrained, then they could simply borrow against their illiquid assets (repaying debts as the returns arrived or when prudent sale was possible) to consume as they like. This is also true for investment flexibility. If investors could borrow against their illiquid assets then they would not need liquid holdings to take advantage of future investment opportunities. The necessity of holding liquid assets for consumption purposes is one motivation for the money-in-the- utility function (MIU) literature. The MIU framework puts money, an asset without consumption value nor any investment return, into the utility function as a reduced form representation of all the ways that money (as the most liquid asset) makes consumption easier and more efficient.
