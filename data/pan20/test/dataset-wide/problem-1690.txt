we had a disk failure on our VM host (VMWare ESXI 5.1). We've managed to get some of the data off but some of the file we couldn't get as it kept on causing the disk to crash. I have file like and and so on but I don't have the or files. I am assuming the files are snapshots disks. Is there a way I can tell the VM to use these VMDK's files instead as when I select it and try to power on the server it says that it couldn't find the disk image or the required snapshots. If possible we really need to be able to recover this VM. Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Its not exactly a fix but I have found another workaround as all other work arounds on Google didn't fix my problem. The problem seems to be something to do with OpenSuSE 12.3 and 13.1, but the issue is no longer a problem running Subversion on CentOS 6.5. 

Does this sound correct, as I can't see anything about specific TCP health checks and that an RST packet in this case would be expected. Thanks 

I've been experiencing some issues with two servers that I have with my VPS hosting provider where I've been getting intermittent connection errors. I've done LAN traces from the server and I spotted what I believe is an issue between the load balancer (provided by the hosting provider) connecting to the server. In the trace I see the load balancer send a SYN, the server responds with SYN ACK and then the load balancer sends back RST ACK as shown in the snippet below 

192.168.255.20 being the load balancer and 192.168.173.16 being the server. From my understanding of TCP, seeing RST packets in a trace is a bad thing as it means packet not recognised, invalid connection, socket not open etc and its aborting connection due to an issue. I queried this with my hosting provider and they said its normal, its just part of a TCP health check between the load balancer and the server. This striked me as a little odd, I can't find anything specific about TCP health check doing something different than just a normal TCP connection, but I assumed the health check is as simple as open connection to socket and then close. I tested this while doing a trace from my laptop to a linux box at home and then I see laptop sends SYN, receive SYN ACK, laptop sends back ACK. When I disconnect I then get FIN followed by FIN ACK from each device to close the connection. This is what I was expecting to see from the load balancer. I queried this again with my hosting provider and they have come back with the following statement: 

Raid 0 is not mirroring - it is striping. There is no redundancy, if one disk fails you lose everything. Raid 1 is mirroring. You don't get anywhere near twice the speed in practice. 

Have you installed the VMware Tools into the guest? I seem to recall there being a shrink option in there. Hang on, I'll just check... ...hmmm apparently the Tools shrink option doesn't work for pre-allocated disk (or one with snapshots). Did you pre-allocate the disk? Or did you just let it grow to the current size? 

You can have all the whizzbang technology in the world. Customers still won't be happy. You are simply enabling them to do their job. Their job may make them happy, but most times IT is invisible to them and only rears it's ugly head when things go wrong. 

We've seen users sneak Firefox onto their machines, even though they are not local admins. As it doesn't "install" you just need the expanded distribution on a network share and just run firefox.exe direct over the network. They found this out themselves when they discovered that IE6 (our SOE browser) is incompatible with a growing number of apps. So it can sneak in the backdoor! A big reason for not using Firefox is the lack of official ActiveX support. We have a number of these around the business. 

Do you mean ESX or Vmware Server (the freebie that runs on Windows)? I assume you mean ESX...in which case there are various options. How are you doing it now? Also what speed is the link? LAN or WAN? 100Mbps or 1Gbps etc? If you are copying from Windows using WinSCP or similar then that will be slow. SCP does encryption on the fly and WinSCP is particularly slow I find. Another alternative is to enable FTP server on the ESX host. Then you can just ftp from Windows, which will be hugely quicker. If you are going from ESX to ESX you can use command line scp which isn't too bad (compared to the Windows version). 

I had an existing 2-way DFS-R replication topology set up, consisting of two servers, one was Windows 2003 R2 and the other Windows 2008 R2. This was working fine. Last week I upgraded the Win 2003 server to Windows 2008 R2. It was a VM, so the upgrade process just involved creating a new Win 2008 R2 OS C: drive and attaching the data disks (vmdk files) from the old VM. I then renamed the old Win 2003 VM to server-old and renamed the new Win 2008 VM to the original old name, like so: 

I have a web server which hosts SVN. Its been working for ages without any issues but now all of a sudden doesn't want to commit any changes. When I try and commit my project to SVN I get the following error message from the ankvsh client for Visual Studio, but i get the same error when using TortoiseSVN Subversion reported an error: 

I've noticed the mysqld.log is being filled up with these log messages about the statement not be safe to log in a statement format for the MySQL replication. I know the query is fine, and from what I've googled the query is fine, but there is a bug in MySQL that it reports the query as potentially being unsafe when it is fine (I know what this error is referring to and why some queries may not be potentially safe to run as a statement replication). What I want to know is there a way to stop these messages from being written to the log file, as the log file is huge (over 40GB) and growing, but don't want to change the replication from statement to binary logging. 

I need to upgrade a SLES 11 SP3 server for the new ghost vulnerability that has been discovered. According to $URL$ I should be able to run zypper although this doesn't work as it says there are no packages found. However, Zypper isn't any good to me any as the server I need to upgrade doesn't have direct access to the internet, so I need an offline install, I guess an RPM would be best. I've had a look at the novel repos but it doesn't seem to have been updated. Thanks for your help. 

I've done a google and everyhing is saying that it is something related to a proxy. I am not using a proxy but forums were suggesting that if it is proxy related which is blocking the dav, to access the repository via HTTPS so the proxy server would just pass the connection through as it wouldn't see that it is a DAV request. I've therefore generated a SelfSigned certificate and installed into apache but I still get the error above when trying to commit the project. Thanks for any help you can provide. UPDATe Below is a snippet of a lantrace hopefully it might help 

Have you given AD enough time to replicate the DNS data to all domain controllers? Assuming you are using AD-integrated DNS. In the DNS snap-in try connecting to the other sites and see if the DNS is different. 

I have a spreadsheet on a Windows 2003 R2 server. The clients are all Windows 7 using Excel 2010. If a remote user opens the spreadsheet first then any other "local" user gets access denied if they try to open the file afterwards. By "remote" I mean across a WAN link, whereas "local" means on a LAN to the server. Is it possible to allow the file to be opened "read-only" instead of getting access denied? The spreadsheet is not configured to be shared within Excel. This is not a permissions issue, everyone can access the file at the NTFS permissions level. I suspect it may be to do with op locks and the fact that the remote user is across a slow link (satellite). 

I need users to be able to copy a folder on a network share to another folder on the same share. They need to copy security too. They cannot use their normal logged in account as it doesn't have enough permissions (the folder is a "template" folder and is locked down with restrictive NTFS security). So I created a proxy account with full permissions and a batch file that calls runas like runas /noprofile /env /user:proxyaccount@mydomain.com z:\copy_folder.cmd copy_folder.cmd just contains a robocopy command to copy the folder. The runas fails with "cannot find file copy_folder.cmd". Z: is mapped correctly and I have tried runas without the /noprofile and /env switches but I get the same error. What syntax should I be using for runas to find copy_folder.cmd? 

Yes stsadm is fine, it will backup the database contents and site. You should also do a SQL backup of the backend db just in case. We have a scheduled task that runs stsadm daily and dumps the backup to a folder. From there our backup software slurps it up and puts it on tape. EDIT - it appears my advice above is only good for small (<15GB) sites according to Technet. For bigger sites they recommend not using stsadm. This is news to me too, so I'd better read the link! 

Snapshots are 100% reliable in this scenario. I would be inclined to believe your developer has made a mistake. The snapshot doesn't deal with "files" it deals with low level disk blocks. If there was any problem with the snapshot you would have more serious errors than missing files, more likely you would get partition corruption or disk failure errors (assuming the vmdk could even be mounted). 

I have two web servers with my hosting provider, both running CentOS 7 x64, both have the same apache configuration, PHP configuration, iptables configuration etc. I have a web monitoring agent that sends an HTTP request to various URLs that I want to monitor every 15 seconds using datadog. Its set to alert on a connection timeout after 5 seconds. The only difference between the two servers are one has 4GB RAM with 4 CPU Cores. The other is 2GB RAM with 1 CPU Core. Both servers originally were receiving timeout alerts every few hours, upon many days, and weeks, talking with my hosting provider and running checks to try and determine the cause. We checked the network going into the servers and each hop using PING and MTR commands and proved the network to the servers is fine, there is no packet loss. We've checked DNS resolution time, DNS resolution is quick so that's definietly not the issue, we've also checked TCP response time, which is also quick. Upon taking LAN traces from the server we found that the servers were responding with a SYN/ACK after a SYN even though pings were responding happily during this time, but because of the SYN not being responding to, the server was constantly sending retransmissions. We found a link on serverfault which a potential fix, although the setting I had already matched serverfault. I ended up building a test server with a new host provider, and found the issue went away - ideally I wanted to stay with the original provider, been happy with them for about 5 years, so I compared the kernel TCP settings with the new host with the current host. I found a couple of differences where I turned off net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen and turned on net_ipv4_tcptimestamps. I changed these settings on both servers and the issue magically went away, but only on one of them 1. I was at a bit of a loss as to why it would fix it for 1 server, but the not the other, and getting a bit desperate (this has been going on for nearly 4 weeks) I reinstalled server 2. For 2 days I didn't receive another timeout so thought that had somehow fixed it (I was getting timeouts 3 to 4 times a day originally so going 2 days without one looked promising), but then out of nowhere got another connection timeout alert. As mentioned previously, TCP response time is minimal, DNS response time is minimal, HTTP response time is minimal, and when the timeout occurs, there's no trace of it in the apache log so it looks like apache never attempted to process the request but we've confirmed the network itself is perfectly fine. Has anyone else seen this before, or could shed any light on what else I can try to try and determine what this issue is. Thanks for any help you can provide.
