This is something I've been thinking about lately. You look up any reconstructed proto-language, you'll probably find an estimate as to when it was spoken. But how can this number be determined? From my research, these numbers came from an outdated theory that languages all change at the same rate (which has clearly been proven false), thus you can date a proto-language by the number of changes that have occurred. Well, if this method has long since been debunked, then why are the results of it still widely accepted? That doesn't make any logical sense. Why would you continue to accept the results decades after the method used to determine said results has been debunked? 

Many forms of 'suppletion' in English can be explained through simple sound changes. Like how the plural -s is voiced if the noun ends in a voiced consonant. Or how our stem-changes (and in other Germanic languages too) are a consequence of vowel harmony in the ancient past. Though I believe that would more properly be known as 'allomorphy'. What I'm more interested in, is the form of suppletion where one morpheme has multiple unrelated forms depending on its usage. Like English 'to go' vs 'went'. Or saying you 'got' something, rather than 'have' it. This form of suppletion is often rather logical. i.e. If you got(as in 'retrieved' or 'acquired') something, then that must mean you currently have it. But what causes people to replace past tenses and plural forms with other morphemes like this? Why would people replace 'to have' with 'got'? There's already a present tense form of 'to have', so why replace it? There's no logical need to. What could incentivize people to do something so random? You see it everywhere, even in languages that are completely unrelated to each other. But there's also languages, I hear, that never do this. 

Linguistics is an old field, its almost as old as writing itself. The first writing systems weren't very precise. Any syllable that sounded similar was represented with the same symbol. Some however did notice the different syllables that one grapheme could represent, and thus began research that evolved into phonology. However, this remained the only field of linguistics up until modern times. You'll notice that its the most developed field of linguistics. Its well understood how the phoneme inventories of languages and the pronunciation of words change over time, but virtually nothing is known of how grammar changes. The only thing that's really known well is the evolution of case endings, which is solely because it overlaps heavily with sound change. As for jlawler's comment, that doesn't mean its impossible to determine. We do have information on how a word's meaning can change over time. And we do have information on the evolution of past tenses in the Germanic languages. Several times German's imperfect and perfective have merged, only for another perfective to develope and to later merge again. To me, how 'will' came to be a future tense marker is pretty obvious. People probably improvised a future tense by saying 'X wants to Y'. This later became a grammatical particle. The question is more how the modern word 'want' developed. Looking up its etymology, it originally meant 'to lack'. It would appear that over time, English speakers came to associate 'lacking something' with wanting it. I imagine this was strengthened as 'to will' lost its original meaning. This is also evident in the noun 'want', which started off meaning 'deficiency', but later came to mean 'something not possessed but wanted'. Interesting side note, 'ich will' still means 'I want' (the infinitive form is 'wollen', but the o becomes an i in several conjugations). They instead use their verb 'werden' meaning 'to become' to form a future tense. Though it does still maintain is independent meaning of 'to become'. 

The 'i' being pronounced differently in English is because of the 'great vowel shift' (look it up). As for the w being pronounced differently, its because the w was originally pronounced as the English w in all Germanic languages, but in several of them (including German), it changed into a v sound. Also, the final 'e' in English 'wise' was originally pronounced. This caused the 's' to be pronounced as a 'z' sound, which is a common thing to happen to consonants that appear in between vowels. This obviously didn't happen in German though. Funny enough, the 's' in German is more often than not pronounced as a 'z'. Its only pronounced as an 's' when it appears at the end of a syllable or word, or its doubled (as in wissen). As for what the word they are descended from meant, I don't know. But its obvious that these two are related. Wissen means 'to know (a fact)' while 'wise' means something like 'to be knowledgeable'. Not only are their meanings related, but they also obviously resemble each other. German is one of English's closest surviving relatives (though not the closest, English's closest relatives would actually be the Frisian languages). 

In German and Spanish (I think), you use the word for 'from'. In Japanese though, I think they use 'ni' (which can either mean 'to' or 'at'). In English we use the preposition 'by', which is rarely used for anything other than passives. Though it can have a locative meaning, which is what I think was its original meaning. Are there other ways languages do this? To me, improvising with another preposition can potentially cause ambiguity issues. At least in English, if two 'by's would appear in a sentence, we can replace one with 'next to'. I.e: *"It was put by the fridge by Bob" "It was put next to the fridge by Bob" In German though, I don't know what you would do. As far as I know, they don't have another preposition they can use to mean 'von/from'. And of course 'von' is far more commonly used than 'by' in English. And Japanese 'ni' is even more commonly used than that! Really the only two things we express exclusively with 'by' is the agent of a passive construction, and the author of a book. What are some other ways that languages use? I'd prefer answers from languages from different families. Languages that are related to each other are of course more likely to use the same tactic than languages that aren't (its probably why most European languages use the word for 'from'). 

This is something I was just thinking about. Adjectives in a lot of languages can also take modifiers of their own: very big, more intelligent, etc... But is there an actual word for the part of speech such words comprise? I've mostly seen them thrown under 'adverbs', even though some can't be used adverbially, aka to modify a verb. Adjectives modify nouns, adverbs modify verbs, so what modifies adjectives and adverbs? I really feel like they're a part of speech of their own, but grammarians don't seem to agree with me, as I've already mentioned. I for one prefer linguistic terminology over what terminology you're taught in grammar class. I don't like to use the terms 'relative clause' and 'dependent clause' (or w/e the terms are), I just use 'adjectival clause' and 'adverbial clause' all the time, because I find them far more logical. And besides, they often have words for parts of speech that you don't see in your average grammar class (such as stative verb and coverb, granted English doesn't have words in either of those parts of speech, but I see that as irrelevant here). Is there even a name for words in this part of speech? I don't think there would be too many words in that category, but so what? There's some languages on this planet that only contain 2 or 3 prepositions (Tagalog and Tok Pisin come to mind). 

I've seen it before, but I don't know what it would be called. I know that some of the Romance languages used to have a specific tense used only for stories (at least, fictional ones). They're no longer used, and as a consequence only the third person conjugations are still known for most verbs. But I don't think I've ever seen an actual name for this. I'm not even sure if its actually considered a tense, or mood, or what. Either way, could someone perhaps tell me the name of this? 

For some reason, the Wikipedia article makes no mention of any adpositions of any kind. I find it highly unbelievable that the language makes no use of such. It has a case system, but there's only 8 cases. Even Finnish with its massive 15 cases still makes use of some postpositions (if you can call them that). Of course, I know Wikipedia isn't the most reliable source of information, but you know, its hard to find free reference grammars online. I don't get why the article would omit something like that. Really, all the article gives is the language's seemingly innumerable declensions and conjugations. 

You see this a lot in the auxlang movement that having gendered pronouns is sexist. But making conlangs of my own, I find its absence to be often annoying. No one seems to realize how useful it is to be able to use different pronouns to refer to different people. If you only have one, you're often forced to just refer to everyone by name or some kind of title. I imagine in the real world, a true gender-neutral pronoun would eventually vanish due to its definition being too broad. At the very least its use would diminish over time even if it did exist, thus making it relatively temporary. 

I know the Romance languages do this with pronouns, but they don't do this with noun phrases. Are there any natlangs out there where the subject and direct object always precedes the verb, but everything else comes after it? 

A passive serves the function of promoting a direct object to subject. In English, the main focus is on the agent most of the time (an agent is the person/thing that does something in a sentence). This helps in what is called 'pivotting', where two sentences are assumed to have the same subject. i.e: Bob bought groceries, then went home. We don't need to restate the subject in the second clause, thanks to pivotting. However, what if the agent of the first sentence is the direct object of the next sentence (or vice-versa)? A passive allows this to happen. i.e: The cat run up a tree because it was being chased. As the second example demonstrates, using a passive also allows you to drop the agent. This can also be used to improvise an anti-causative, which is a construction where something happens to something with no apparent cause. Not all languages have passives. But not all languages have nominative alignment. Ergative languages for example typically have an anti-passive instead. This is because in ergative languages, the direct object is more focused on than the agent. In fact, you can determine which alignment a language has by simply telling a person who speaks the language this: Bob hit bill, then ran. Then you ask them: Who ran away? If they answer 'Bob', then the language is nominative. But if they speak an ergative language, they will assume its bill, because that's how their language works. Sentences pivot around the direct object rather than the agent most of the time. If they wanted to specify that Bob was the one who ran away, they would have to use an anti-passive construction in the second clause. English being a nominative language, we don't need to do such. However, we have the reverse problem in that if the direct object of the first sentence is the agent/subject of the next sentence, then we have to use a passive construction in the first sentence. Neither really has an advantage over the other, in fact languages are almost as likely to be ergative as nominative. It should be noted though that there's other alignments besides these two. And one language family uses an alignment system unique to that family (its called Austronesian alignment, named after the language family of course). Of course some languages just don't bother with either a passive or anti-passive. For example, Basque, which is an ergative language, doesn't have an anti-passive, or pivotting in general. Speakers claim that their language doesn't really have a concept of a subject. They do have agents and direct objects, but they don't ever emphasize one over the other. And it should be noted that generative linguistics is an out-dated theory that mostly only fans of Chomsky really pay attention to. If you want to see why, read up on L1 acquisition (the study of how kids pick up their first language). It pretty clearly disproves generative linguistics. Children for example don't realize that they can transform statements into questions or vice-versa. In fact, they tend to learn to ask questions first before statements. Which makes sense. They don't know enough at first to give an answer to anything, they're still learning about the world. So of course questions come before statements. 

I know there are plenty of languages out there where possessive personal pronouns can and do agree with the head noun in number and case. But I was wondering if there were any where nouns also had to agreed when placed in the possessive/genitive case? If grammatical number is marked with a suffix, then that means that such nouns may need to take two endings in the possessive: one to indicate the number of the noun, and another to agree with the number of the head noun. 

If you're referring to the right, as in conservative politics, that originated in France long ago when the right-wing politicians would sit on the right side of the room, while left-wing politicians would sit on the left. 

In the Language Construction Kit 2, the author makes the assertion that sub-clauses, in particular center-embedded clauses, add complexity. That is obviously true, but he claims that you can make do without them (its in a section where he's talking about auxlangs and what features he thinks you should avoid). But are there any languages that actually lack this? Thinking about it, it would be hard and rather clumsy to have to break up center-embedded clauses into separate sentences, but that may be just because I'm used to having such a convenience. I do know that languages differ on how complex a sub-clause can be. English allows constructions that wouldn't be allowed in other languages, but there are still things that some languages allow that English doesn't. I don't believe I've ever seen a serious auxlang (unless you count Toki Pona, but that was more intended to be an artlang) that didn't allow sub-clauses. I even found an auxlang called 'Kah' whose grammar is obviously based off of Chinese, but even that allows sub-clauses and even center-embedding (which is surprising given the lack of explicit marking on anything). 

There is an articial language called Kelen which lacks verbs (or supposedly). It instead uses four 'rationals' to show how the noun phrases interact with eachother. It was designed to be alien, but people have supposedly translated texts written by the author back into a natlang. And she has I believe translated texts herself into the language. To me it looks more like a language with a very minimal verb system. But perhaps that's what you're looking for? I have also heard of some odd philosophical languages that treat all 'actions' as a state of being, or treat nouns as being transient phases rather than objects (this mostly just boils down to nouns having tense). As for natlangs that do? No, there are none. Its one the few linguistic universals: all languages differentiate nouns from verbs. Of course parts of speech aren't universal. Chinese has 'coverbs' that act as both prepositions and verbs. And eastern languages in general tend to treat adjectives as just a sub-class of verbs (they double as verbs meaning 'to be X', and can even take tense, even if used adjectivally). But there is no language that puts nouns and verbs into the same category. Well, confrontational languages kind of do, but often times the word has different meanings depending on whether its used as a noun or verb (a fly vs to fly, produce vs to produce). Honestly its more like a lazy form of derivation.
