if I change $\rho$ to 0.5, you get the desired result (that using labour does increases output). You can also see the plot of delta output here. It is clear that the delta output is always negative, and asymptotically zero for $x=\infty$, which is when $L^*=0$. 

Some early authors of this discipline are Michael Kalecki, Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Luigi Pasinetti, and Piero Sraffa. More recent authors include Wynne Godley, Steve Keen, Frederic S. Lee, and Marc Lavoie. A recent introduction to PK can be found in Godley and Lavoie (2007). There is also a very comprehensive two-volume Oxford Handbook of Post-Keynesian Economics. Sources: own research, and Keen (2013). 

If taxation is your main interest (making this question different from others on this site), perhaps the best book around is the 1980's classic by Atkinson and Stiglitz, Lectures in Public Economics. There is an updated version. See the Table of Contents here. If you are simply interest in microeconomic textbooks, see here, here, and here. 

The calculation of PPP is a very complex, resource consuming task. As you can imagine, coming up with a single number comparing countries relative purchasing power means many assumptions have to be taken (i.e there is a trade-off between realism and simplicity). The most comprehensive documentation relating the methodology behind PPP can be found in this World Bank website. Here I just give a brief idea of what's going on. Check the documentation for further clarity (particularly Chapter 4). The calculation of PPP goes in stages. First, data on prices of individual products within a basic heading (a macro category, e.g. food) is computed. From here, relative prices for each product across two countries are computed, and aggregated at the basic heading level using a geometric mean. An example is given in Table 1 of Chapter 4, copied below: 

Deflationary recession refers to a recession in which prices are falling. An example was the Great Depression. Below you have a graph of the yearly rate of change in CPI. A negative number means a fall in prices, i.e. deflation. Shaded areas mean recession period according to NBER. 

Check here for a not so old review of the literature on School Choice. Here is an interesting analysis of the Chilean education system, in the light of Friedman's ideas. Friedman had the idea that competition would increase quality across the whole spectrum of schools: 

Albeit machine learning is confounded with big data, it shows a rise in their use since 2014. Surely, this is a very narrow selection of the literature (NBER working papers, and only abstracts), but is a start. Regarding where you can find papers using machine learning, you can use "keyword" search here (26,665 documents are found), or here (337 documents are found). The latter allows you to select dates, which you could use to build your own indicator of machine learning related publications per year. Finally, related to blogs, I am not aware of a dedicated ML/DL economist's blog. However, here there is a very useful blog aggregator, which has indexed most of the "serious" blogs available. The full list of blog posts indexed is here. A search for "machine" or "deep" does not yield a result. However, there are some hits for "econometric" and "statistics" which might help you. 

There are plenty of issues that can be relevant here, which mean it is hard to give a precise answer. On the one hand, even though GDP is not growing, at least the balance of trade is roughly unchanged. Some countries could experience an equivalent unaffected change in GDP via a trade deficit (e.g. if part of the fall in net imports is compensated with, say, an increase in consumption), which can fuel a currency depreciation and create inflationary pressures, not only on imported goods but on locally produced good which use imported inputs. On the other hand, it is interesting to compare two countries with the same GDP but different level of exports and imports. The country with greater trade levels is more likely engaged in global value chains, which spur specialisation, and learning for local producers. The literature recognises the role of trade as a mechanism to spur technology transfer (and even transfer of ideas), thereby fostering productivity and growth. 

In such model (as in most of simple one-good models), capital and output are interchangeable - they are the same good. Thus, capital can be "consumed". Any excess capital that the young do not want will be consumed by the old. 

I see no problem in $m$ being absent from the equation, as it enters additively in the utility function. The partial utility obtained from this good is represented in the 1 that you get in the derivative. This is, the marginal utility obtained from an extra unit of $m$ is independent of the amount the individual consumes of $m$. Additionally, as both type of consumers value the $m$ good equally, the distribution of $m$ is then irrelevant for the optimality of any allocation. Your solution tells you that the relation between the level of consumption of $x_1$ and $x_2$ is that of 5 to 3. Then, what you need to do is to allocate the aggregate resources among all consumers such that the proportion holds. If two two type of consumers have in total 40 units of $x$, then the allocation is that of 25 for type one consumers, and 15 for type two consumers.

I think the general proof is in this paper. Thinking in a simple exchange Edgeworth Box, a competitive economy involves prices, which mediate the relationship between consumers relative valuation of goods - the marginal rate of substitution. A (benevolent) social planner does not need those prices, as goods will not be traded in the market, but simply allocated to whom it "corresponds", based on the same optimality conditions. Such equilibrium is simply found by equalising consumers marginal rate of substitution. In other words: 

I would say there is some degree of correspondence between the two dichotomies. However, in the economic side of things, there is in my opinion a much clearer relation between positive and normative economics (at least in the theoretical side), as it is through the use of positive economics that normative means are supposed to be achieved. The other dichotomy however seems to be less formal in this relation. Individuals or agents can have a given understanding of the world, but this might not be correct, or precise. Thus, if they base their manipulative actions based on their perceptions of the objective reality, it does not necessarily mean they are using the correct map of reality to act upon it. In other words, positive economics is (allegedly) science, whereas agents cognition is not necessarily (and perhaps not mainly) built upon scientific knowledge. Now, having said this, it is also debatable that the normalite-positive dichotomy is as clear as initially theorised by Milton Friedman in his 1953 book "Essays in Positive Economics". For example, some Marxists argue that science itself (at least social sciences) is part of the tools used by the ruling/capitalist class to exert control over society. In philosophy of science, there has been a long debate about what science is and about whether there is such thing as "scientific progress", or whether science is just ideology (for example, see here).
