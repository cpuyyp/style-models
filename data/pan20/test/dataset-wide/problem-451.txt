It's safer and way easier just to buy another MissingLink (KMC's name for their master link design) of the same type (pin length) the chain came with, leaving you with an inner link that has one on either end. They're around $2US. In addition to saving the trouble of getting the pin back in there, there's also the question of the integrity of modern outer chain links once they've had a pin pushed back through, even in the more normal circumstance of pushing a link halfway out for chain removal. Every current major manufacturer of derailer chains except KMC says not to do this, due to the risk of the fit not being as tight after re-insertion as it's supposed to be. I've long wondered whether there's actually anything different about KMC in this regard, but I know that modern chains in general are prone to breaking, usually during hard or fumbled front shifts, when they've been reconnected the "traditional" way. I wouldn't venture to guess what the odds are of it happening, probably quite low, but putting in another MissingLink eliminates the risk. They're very trouble-free. Having a couple close together may seem goofy but doesn't cause any issues in practice. 

The goal here is to make the chainline of the new SS setup correct while avoiding frame clearance issues with the crank/ring. Depending on what you're doing in back, you may also have some ability to configure Q-factor to your liking. Using your existing bottom bracket and the crank with whatever ring you're going to use, measure what chainline it gives you and where the tight spots with the frame might be and how much room you have to work with there. Also ascertain that that BB is putting the cranks symmetrical in the frame. Then measure the existing spindle's length and its offset if applicable. You now have all the numbers you need to do the math for what spindle length will yield a given chainline. (As well as what spacer configuration is needed if you're going to be compensating for a crank that wants an offset BB.) Then just figure out what your rear chainline is going to be. If your rear hub setup is one where you have choices here, you're deciding it based on what Q-factor you want within the constraints of frame clearance. 

The efficiency of the system warbles inconsequentially. Bigger gets you less frictional loss per link, but more links and more weight. That aspect comes out in the wash, and if you really want to figure it out conclusively you would need full information on materials, lubricity, etc. However, the part of this that actually has an impact on function is that bigger gears and more chain wear longer, and so they're more economical and all else equal will be fresh/unworn longer, making them more efficient and less maintenance-intense. Counterbalancing wear is that some disciplines care a lot about obstacle and/or frame/component clearance Those are the two aspects that lead to the different genres of bike using the sizes they do, wear life versus clearance. 

There are a couple things that can be going on here. It's possible to adjust a front derailer, or more specifically some derailer/crank/chainring/chain/shifter combinations, in a way where it can seem fine most of the time and doesn't have any obvious problems with the derailer position, but is prone to jamming the chain, which can in turn cause the chain to get damaged or break. It's a problem that for the most part has to be uncovered by test-riding post-adjustment and making further adjustments, usually to the derailer positioning, as needed on a case-by-case basis. Another thing that can cause what you experienced is the chain breaking due to prior damage, which can include being rejoined in a manner that weakened it. When chain manufacturers say to only use their special connection links/pins and not re-press pins on modern chains the traditional way, what they're trying to prevent is the exact kind of breakage you experienced. I had my only chain breakage ever when early on in my cycling life I re-pressed a pin on my SRAM PC48 instead of using the Powerlink for some bad reason, and it broke very shortly thereafter during a front shift. Finally, there is a limit to how much load a chain can endure while shifting, both as a habit and during single incidences. Pushing that limit can result in a break even without any other issues and regardless of what any mechanic did. 

I could swear there's already an answered and highly upvoted post here that features this exact issue, but I can't find it. This is a really infuriating and mysterious problem. I've run into it a couple times. It's hard to figure out and is an under-publicized issue. The only bright side is the symptoms are always the same - repeat flats, always the same inexplicable cut/gash near the valve, rim side, no burrs, no irregularities, no protruding spokes, rim strip in good condition, replacing rim strip anyway doesn't help. In other words, it is not any of the usual causes of repeat flats from the rim side. It happens due to this combination of factors: 

Most people, even pro racers, would find that everything about what creates a desirable rider position on a tri bike would be close to the diametric opposite in terms of priorities to what you want on a touring bike you'll be on all day, day after day, trying to enjoy yourself. It's true that this could be mitigated somewhat with a position change, ie taller stem and tilting up the bars. That's fine except that it tends to be the case with bikes like this that any significant change requires fully re-cabling it. Also, presuming it has a carbon steerer, you shouldn't put a steerer extender on it. 

There's not really a generic answer as not all finishes will react the same way to a given chemical, especially over time with repeated application. WD-40 has a bunch of naptha, which generally speaking you want to keep away from paint you care about. It also leaves an oil coating behind that can attract dirt, which is ugly and potentially bad for the finish by itself. Just use one of the many silicone cleaner/wax/protectant products. Silicone is good because its whole deal is it doesn't harm any finish type on bikes, regardless of specifics. 

As for clearing a 34, there is no universal answer because it's slightly dependent on where the dropout puts the RD mounting bolt relative to the axle center, which despite Shimano having a standard spec for does have some variance bike to bike. So it's a little bit of an experiment every time. Generally speaking this can be made to work on RDs, including the one in question, with a max cog spec of 32t by running the B-tension screw in reverse or subbing in a longer one. It's also common for it to barely work and/or be a little grindier than desirable in the low gear but basically work. And remember that when you do this, something is lost in shifting performance on the rest of the cassette, so it's not all upside. Exceeding the printed large cog spec by two whole teeth without any B-tension hacks usually doesn't work. I've tried it with various of the 11-speed road RDs, probably including this one but I can't be sure. As for exceeding the total capacity, there are many answers here on this topic but basically the bike will be rideable but will have chain slack in some number of the small/small combinations. Total capacity numbers can basically be taken at face value (in other words they're reasonably honest), so you can do the math to see which ones will be slack, again with a very slight bit of wiggle room due to variance in dropout geometry. Here 18t of the total capacity is being used up front, leaving 19t in back. 34-19=15, so once the chain is long enough to wrap around the 52t ring, 34t cog combo, it can be tensioned on a 15t or above, and below that it will be sagging/floppy. Riding in the floppy gears carries some risk of derailment/jamming. 

First things to check would be cable friction, making sure your b-tension screw is dialed to get the guide pulley as close to the 36 as you can get it without rubbing, and lube pivots. Your cable tension itself could also be on the high side. A directional chain going the wrong direction may also help cause it. Hanger alignment could contribute too. Just because you put a new hanger on doesn't automatically mean it's perfectly aligned, sad but true. 

There is no remotely practical way of doing it. It's possible that could change in the future as 11 trickles down more, but probably not likely given that the interface is also different on the standard axle, less expensive 11-speed road hubs they've already made. Just to be clear though, 11-speed MTB cassettes do not require a new longer freehub, because the large cog overhangs. 

Every non-metal part touched by the fluid could have been damaged by it, and none of it is available as service parts other than the hose. Especially given you're already seeing evidence of the seals degrading, replacing the whole thing is all you can do. 

I don't have a way of knowing absolutely this is true, but it sounds like a severe case of the unnamed phenomenon where the shifter gets pushed into its (presumably) last click, and the system is set up such that this position pushes the front derailer to the absolute limit of what the limit screw and the stretchiness of the cable allow. The cable then statically has a very large amount of tension on it (much more than what the FD return spring provides, which is what the shifting mechanism is designed in mind for), and this makes shifting back take a lot of force, or in rare cases not work at all. If this is what's going on, the main clue would be that cable has an inordinate amount of tension when you pluck it with your finger. The fix is to take a screwdriver and back out the front derailer high limit screw a couple full turns. Then you should be able to downshift as normal. After this you should ideally set the derailer back up again from square one, because if this can happen at all then something isn't quite right. If that's too much you can just reset the high limit back to the normal .5-1mm or so of chain clearance, but you might have to repeat the episode in the future, and this is one of the main contributors to STI levers failing early. 

Adapter devices such as the Jtek Shiftmate and Wolf Tooth Tanpan are designed with the notion that the actuation ratio of the rear derailleurs they're being attached to are dead linear. So, for example, by multiplying a shifter's input pull by an appropriate new ratio, that shifter will act exactly like it has a different cable pull in terms of what click-to-click position the guide pulley winds up in. Is this actually exactly true though? Are their examples in the past or present of RDs that use substantively nonlinear actuation rates? 

135x10, 135x10 QR, or just 135 QR, would all be accurate ways of describing the axle standard as far as frame compatibility is concerned. What can be confusing is "135x10 axle" could be taken as referring to a standard repair axle of given dimensions (in this case 146mm long with M10x1 threads) that a common cup and cone hub would use, like what a typical Shimano or OEM brand mountain/hybrid/etc hub would want if its axle got stripped or broken. Your 370, like most fancy cartridge bearing hubs, takes a specific proprietary axle with shoulders, flat machined spots, etc. The stub of external thread is what the axle hardware threads on to, what you use to adjust the bearings, etc. It does in fact contact the frame. This can be counterintuitive, but the other counterintuitive thing is the very high amount of clamping force provided by the QR skewer. As long as it's clamped down adequately, that connection is keeping the axle from rubbing against the frame in a way that could damage anything. 

Tensiometers test deflection and their charts make the assumption that the entire section being used for the test (the entire length of spoke between the tool's two contact points) is a uniform thickness. That way that section is isolated - if there were any of the taper in there, it would throw off the reading. So you always make sure the tool is touching only the thin section, and you use the chart entry for the thin section. 

I presume it's assembled right. Make sure the bolt threads and shoulder are clean and greased. Putting a layer of fiber grip (aka carbon prep aka Liquid Torque, etc) on whatever area is slipping may help. 

On a lot of the 12mm ones, the part that has the 12mm wrench flats is essentially a nut threaded on to a protruding thread off the freehub body. In that case you're wanting to turn the wrench clockwise when viewed from the drive side or counter/anti-clockwise from the non-drive side. They're one of the higher torque things on bikes and sometimes threadlocker is applied at the factory as well, so taking a lot of force to break free isn't necessarily a red flag as long as you're being sensitive that it doesn't just feel like you're turning the wrong direction. 

I'm sure you can find exceptions, but most or at least many trainers can be made to work with nutted axles. The answers to your questions: 1. I think you mean quick release skewer and not through axle, and not practically because it would involve transplanting in a hollow axle, and hollow axles with the thread size for coaster brake hubs don't really exist. 2. Yes you could do this, but it's not very straightforward, because it would need to be spaced right for the frame, and it would need to be a singlespeed wheel to play nice with the chain that the bike probably already has, and singlespeed QR wheels are a rare breed. So you're talking about buying a standard-axle singlespeed road wheel, freewheel, tube, rim strip, tire, quick release, hollow axle, and some hub spacers, then chopping the axle down to fit a 110mmm spaced frame and installing it in there and getting the spacing right. That all is possible but probably not the simplest path. Here's a video that shows installation of a nutted axle on a Cycleops.
