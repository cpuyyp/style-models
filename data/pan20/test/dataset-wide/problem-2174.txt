I have been working on Upwork as a Software Engineer for 3 years and had a very successful career until my profile got suspended few days ago. I worked in a company for 1 year but after that i just did fulltime freelancing. I had mentioned the projects which i did on Upwork, on my resume and all other job related sites like indeed.com I had also mentioned link to my Upwork profile as well. But as i said that my profile is suspended permanently, i am not able to work, not even my work history is visible, they completely deleted my profile. So how do i mention my projects in my resume? How do i tell in interviews that i worked on Upwork, obviously telling them i got suspended is not good idea. P.S: The projects i did have no online link to see them in action, those are Data Mining projects which help clients to scrape data from different sources. 

It was fixed-price contract to develop Python scraper to scrape 2 websites. I always charge ~$200 per website. We agreed $200 per website. I agreed $200 blindly without analyzing those websites because I was busy in other things. Usually it takes a full day or upto 3 days to write and test code to entirely scrape a website. Today, I studied those 2 websites in question and found a trick to scrape entire website using a single link, in short it will take me max 30 minutes to write scraper for both websites. Should I still charge my client $400 in total? Or tell him that I figured a loop-hole that make it easy for me. 

I have just moved to USA from Pakistan. I have BsCS(hons.) degree from Pakistan. I also have verified/stamped my degree from HEC and MOFA I want to get equivalency of my degree here. What is the process? Do I need to validate my stamp from Pakistan Consulate? If yes, how they do? and what documents I need for that? I don't see any useful information on their site And after doing that, I have to visit any university to get me equivalence? EDIT: I actually have 2 years of professional experience in Software development. I think that is enough to showcase my skills, I can provide employers links to my projects I have done, I also work at UpWork (freelancing platform) and have done over 50 projects with 5/5 feedback. 

The topic of interest is ergonomics, and you can also find lots of information scattered around the web about this topic if you look at keyword terms like workplace ergonomics and workplace health and safety. I suggest that this is something you raise with a OHSO (occupational health and safety officer) because it is something that should be customized to individual shapes and sizes, the equipment that you use and the office environment. 

Get it out of the way so you don't have to dwell on it. Confronting what you are uncomfortable about is really the only way to overcome the issues you are feeling. There are several strategies you can try, depending on the situation and your knowledge or relationship with those people: 

Is this something that people have struggled with in the past? I find that when you look at a card and everyone is writing the same thing, or someone who knows the person well writes something very fitting and personal, it always makes the next person's job that much more difficult. Is there something that you have used in the past that is both simple and not too over the top, especially when you don't know the person very well? 

I think good or bad experiences are defined by how much you learn from them. In a bad work environment there are still plenty of good experiences to be gained. In fact, one of the most common interview questions is to do with the challenges that you face at work, and if you have always worked in an environment where everything works well then it is hard to assess how good your skills are when under pressure or resources are constrained. It also speaks volume for a person to be able to produce good work under trying circumstances, so I would say that it is a matter of being able to separate between things that you have control over (and those that you don't), and also the thing that you can gain from the experiences. 

I was working on a new version of the company website as a side project in addition to my usual work at the company I work for. They made it clear they did not want me to spend a lot of time on it. I built it with a customized WordPress theme with graphics and content, and the feedback was very positive. I told the CEO that I felt it was ready to go live and encouraged him to put it up to use as a marketing tool. I meant to continue working on it after it went live to add more content, but the CEO seemed to assume I would no longer work on it once it went live. The CEO then asked me for the login info, and I discovered through another coworker that he had found someone in Mexico to continue working on it. I wasn't worried at first because I had plenty of other work to do. But just recently I saw an email that revealed the budget for "reviewing and improving the website" is 2,000,000 pesos or approximately $112,000 US. I'm absolutely blown away by the amount that he is willing to spend on a very, very simple website, that I feel is already very close to being complete. The company is supposedly very tight on money and I was doing it for $16 an hour. I'm wondering what I should make of this, and if I should be worried about my job. It seems like they feel I am not worth the $16 an hour they pay me but are willing to spend $112,000 on something I already built. I feel like this might be a sign that either my job, or the entire company, is in trouble somehow. Or perhaps I am just being paranoid, and this doesn't have anything to do with me and is just an extremely poor decision by the CEO To be clear: I do not feel underpaid. I am paid reasonably well considering my experience. I feel like my CEO is massively over-paying someone and I can't figure out why, and don't know what implications it has for me. Clearly something is going on that might not have anything to do with me, but could easily have implications for the company and my job.
