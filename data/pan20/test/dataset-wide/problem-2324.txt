Potentially, aiming at the neck is easier than aiming at the core, as necks tend to be vertical, and arrows drop in the vertical plane; this allows the archer to be slightly off on elevation and still produce a deadly shot. The downside is that they are extremely susceptible to deflections from branches and brush, and they rarely fit in normal quivers. 

Several of the larger heads you see are designed to be shot at shorter distances at the turkey's neck, often from a ground blind. These allow the center point of the arrow to be off by 2", and, in theory, should either cut the turkey's head off, or miss entirely; a decapitated turkey will not go very far. 

You need between 3 and 4" of clear ice to be safe, but, with practice, you can visually determine if there is this amount or more. The key is that ice can support your weight in boots and not yet be safe for dynamic or concentrated loads (i.e. jumping or ice skating). The basic technique is that you first bash the edge of the ice (it is always thinnest at the edge), and look at the thickness underwater. If your bashing put a lot of cracks in the ice or the ice moved on the water, it isn't safe enough to step on. Then you step on the ice -- if it cracks and seems springy, you jump off. Then you jump up and down -- if that's ok, you go out a few feet and look at the ice at slanted angle. Because clear ice refracts light differently depending on its thickness, with a little bit of practice, you can see if the ice is 4"+ thick. In general, if it is 2" or less, a well-driven ski pole will go through it, and if you jump, it it will crack and water will come up through the cracks. Overall, this is something of an experience-based process. 

The theory behind a number of the specialized heads is that a shot to the core of the body will not kill the turkey quickly enough to recover it, and, because the target is so small, leads to lots of shots that merely injure the turkey. 

Do hang the food (or use a bear can, etc.) In my experience, wild animals are not deterred by dogs very much. A bear that lives close to humans might even be attracted to dogs: dogs frequently have dog food with them. Not exactly on topic, but I have woken up to deer approaching my camp, while my large dog was barking her head off. They only stopped advancing when the human stood up. 

BTDT I think, but I don't remember ever having a 'problem'. As a guy who camps and also gets to use squatty potties once in a while, here's my advice: First, ditch the shorts/pants it'll be much more comfortable to squat. Second, the ground doesn't splash as much as a bowl full of water, so the problem probably isn't as bad as you might think. Third, if your cathole is located on a slight slope you'll probably be able to get quite close too it, helping contain problems. A nice benefit of this - less strain on the ankles. Fourth - you can pile up the dirt from the hole near your feet, as extra protection. Fifth -by the time you hike out, whatever's on your boots will be long gone. And final bonus comment - the backwoods is a place to enjoy, not to find out whether you can survive on questionable food choices. Eat food that you would eat in everyday life, cooked properly, and enjoy your trip! 

Layers of fleece plus a very wind resistant outer shell. Anything else (Carhartt type clothes, leather, Mongolian reindeer skins...) will be heavy as heck. Full face coverage would be smart, but it looks like you'll have a windshield at least. Since you'll spend time riding in the cold wind, the conditions will be similar to snowmobiling. Try snowmobiling in eastern Canada or the Dakotas in winter, that should be a good approximation of the conditions. And snowmobile clothes should be the right stuff, heavier than most ski wear - skiers move a little and rarely go more than a mile without stopping. Don't go light on boots and gloves. Those parts cool off fast. Also keep in mind that modern snowmobiles have heated hands grips. Will you? 

I've seen a number of people llama packing in black bear territory in the Sierras. Typically the llamas are hobbled or tied to a line; they can still kick and spit, and they can make noise. Most bears are afraid of humans and domestic animals; the ones that aren't rapidly get shot and/or relocated. Even so, a bear would certainly prefer a poorly guarded gorp cache (or the feed of the llama) to a large angry domestic animal, so, in practice, it isn't necessary to take special precautions for llamas, or horses for that matter. Mountain lions may be a different case, but I haven't seen too many llama packers in mountain lion territory. 

In the 80s and 90s, Ray Jardine popularized using sneakers on the PCT, which is very smooth and dry. However, hikers in the Adirondacks have to deal with rain nearly every day, deep mud, large numbers of rock crossings, and poorly maintained trails; a much larger proportion of them choose ankle-high boots. Most streams have bridges there, so one doesn't have to swap footwear very often. Finally, Scandanavia features a lot of bogs and swamps and is generally quite wet; relatively few streams have bridges. Knee-high rubber Wellington-style boots allow you to walk cross-country through mud and streams without changing footwear. 

To a large extent, it depends on the climate, terrain, and trail conditions of the part of the US that you are hiking in; your observations are limited to one section of the US. Also, prior answers have not mentioned the advantage of a stiffer sole with a shank for rock and root hopping. Compared to the Eastern or Midwestern sections of the US, the western US (which contains the PCT and the CDT) has a much drier climate, fewer rivers, less mud, more dust, fewer rocks and roots, and smoother and better graded trails. Early conventional wisdom was to use heavier boots. This was because: 

You will need to determine the loading gauge of the railway carriages as well as the profile of the tunnel to see if any of these suggestions will work. Also, be aware that trains are often scheduled in groups, so once your first train passes, there may be more shortly thereafter. Again, this is an extremely bad idea. 

Some, not all, do indeed come in two sides, and which one you use depends on the reason you use it. One of the sides strongly reflects heat. A hypothermic person therefore wants to have that reflective side on the inside so that it helps keeping any warmth inside. A person suffering from heat stroke wants the reflective side outside so that heat is kept away from that person. Note that the latter doesn't work too well, because warmth is also trapped by putting the person into the blanket in the first place. But you can use it, for example, to keep the inside of your tent colder than if you had it in the blazing sun without that reflector, similar to what people put in their windscreens in parked cars. Which side is which might depend on the manufacturer and I'd suggest reading the instructions. In one example I could find, the gold side was the heat-providing side. However, it's questionable whether those blankets are suitable for outdoor use at all, see this link 

I'm currently looking to buy a new tent. The old one had a floor that was said to withstand a hydrostatic head of 10000 mm, but the tents I find in the stores here go to at most 3000 mm for the floor, at least in the light-weight category. Is that still sufficient to keep me dry in Pacific Northwest weather? What about camping on snow? 

The answers regarding flammability (and the ensuing death trap) and carbon monoxide poisoning are correct. Even in foul weather, cook outside your tent. If you do lots of camping in bad weather (New Zealand's West Coast?) get a tent with a vestibule. There is one additional problem: In bear country, you never want to cook too close to your tent, because if you and your tent and everything inside it smells of food, guess who'll be coming to visit you at night? 

There is really only one way to determine this, and that is experience. Do a few hikes in different terrain, different settings (dayhike vs overnight), different weather and different group sizes, keep track of your time and thus build up a "library" of situations and times. Once you have a few of these reference hikes, you can then apply these to new situations.
