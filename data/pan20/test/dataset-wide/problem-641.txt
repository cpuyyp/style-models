In addition to improperly tuned derailleurs, drivetrain slippage may also be caused by a worn chain or cassette. Worn Chain: One way to check whether the chain is worn is to use a chain wear indicator. They're cheap and easy to carry with you, but if you'd rather not buy one and if the rental place has a repair shop, you could ask to either borrow theirs or see if they could check the chain wear. You would use that tool by placing it in the chain like this: 

In a similar situation - bike tire marks, trainer residue and grease spots on the carpet - we found that scrubbing the carpet using a concentrated dish detergent (like Dawn, etc) worked very well. 

In common cycling parlance, 53/39 is referred to as "standard" gearing for road cranksets, and most mechanics or experienced cyclists will understand that if you say you have a "standard crankset", you have a 53/39. Why is this the case? Who or what caused cycling to specifically adopt 53/39 as "standard" (rather than 52, 51, 50, etc)? Most bikes nowadays ship with a compact crankset, since manufacturers recognize that the majority of cyclists have difficulties turning over a 53T chainring. However, that only explains why 53/39 is not shipped as standard equipment on most bikes, it doesn't explain how 53/39 came to be referred to as "standard". As to the "ego/testosterone" explanation, that explains why some cyclists upgrade from compact cranksets. However, there are cyclists that are more than capable of turning a 53T chainring and, therefore, their reasoning for using a 53T does not involve ego/testosterone/posturing. Additionally, this explanation doesn't really explain why 53T is the "standard" big ring, rather than 54T or 55T. A comment on a previous question sparked this (apologies to that user as I can't seem to find their comment now). 

I therefore conclude that Garmin and the other half-dozen fitness apps/gizmos I've tried all grossly exaggerate calorie usage. Why? Because looking at your expensive gizmo and seeing a huge number of calories burned makes you happy and sells more product. So, based on my admittedly casual and anecdotal observations, I would recommend subtracting 50-75% from whatever Garmin says for a reasonably accurate estimate of calorie burn. 

I purchased a new mountain bike online. As I understand it, new bikes are usually shipped only partially assembled, but I don't really know what to expect. Will it just be a matter of attaching large assemblies like pedals and handlebars, or should I expect to have to route cables, setup derailleurs, etc? I know it probably varies somewhat between manufacturers, but what would be the typical level of assembly I should expect? EDIT: For clarification, I'm comfortable doing almost all my own maintenance and I own most of the necessary tools. I'm just looking for an idea of what to expect and how much time to allot. 

Is this likely the problem? If so, how do I re-lubricate the shifter after the WD-40? To do it properly would require at least partially disassembling the shifter, which from what I've read and having seen the schematics, is something I really don't want to do. 

I'm in the market for a new cassette for my road bike and I frequently see cassettes listed as mountain bike or road bike. Since they're usually interchangeable and can be used on either type of bike, what makes manufacturers designate them as one type or the other? 

I'm in the market for a used cyclocross bike to use as a winter bike, and so I've been browsing craigslist. I generally ride a 56-58 cm road bike frame, so I turned down an otherwise good deal because it was a 52 cm frame. The seller told me that a 52 cm cyclocross frame was comparable to a 54 cm road frame. Is that statement true? And if it is true, how is that so? 

The other advancements are great - carbon frames, 11-speed, electronic shifting, carbon wheels, etc - but they're not essential for jumping into races. If you're curious whether your setup is "good enough" for racing, take note of how well you keep pace with your peers in one of the faster group/shop rides in your area. 

Making sure your hands and arms are loose helps to not only take pressure off your hands, but it also can help keep your shoulders and breathing more relaxed as well. Try riding with a tense upper body for a long period of time and you will see the difference. Therefore, while it probably isn't feasible to do for long periods of time, you should be able to remove your hands from the bars while continuing in the same position you just were (leaning forward, but not sitting up). 

Without any inside information into the R&D efforts of Shimano, SRAM or Campagnolo, it's pure speculation at best. I assume that they are looking at the idea of 12-speed, but it'll probably be close to 10 years until we see it (9 to 10 speed took ~7 years; 10 to 11 speed took ~9 years), especially with all the focus on electronic gruppos at the moment. Same answer in regards to the freewheel standards...it's impossible to say, since 12 speed hasn't even come out yet. Bottom line: it's hard to know for sure, but it's believable that they (the big three) would be developing 12 speed. 

On any given race within the pro peloton, the teams whose sponsors offer both aero and traditional frames (BMC, Trek, Canyon, etc) typically have a mix of riders on each style of frame, but the GC leaders and climbers on those teams are almost exclusively riding a bike with a more traditional frame. Their bike fits look to be just as aggressive and both bike styles can be built to the UCI weight limit, yet you don't typically see Contador on a Venge or Tejay on a Timemachine. What benefits do more traditional bikes provide that outweigh the watt savings that aero bikes provide (Roughly 28 watts within BMC's line), especially since both aero and traditional bikes can be built to UCI weight limit? 

If the components really are the same (and I think you'll find that's unusual if there is a large price difference) then odds are the cheaper bike is probably a better value. The more expensive bike may have other qualities that are superior, but those differences probably won't be big enough to overcome the price differential. I'd say that for the average cyclist it rarely makes sense to buy the more expensive name brand if a bike with nearly identical components can be had for less. But there's the rub -- they rarely are nearly identical unless they're also fairly close in price. 

Cateye uses proprietary sensors, so I'm afraid that generic ANT+ sensors won't work. Although it's possible someone has made a copycat sensor that works with Cateye, I doubt it. 

Today I encountered a puncture. I pulled the tube, ran my fingers around the inside and outside of the tire carefully looking for the offending object, found nothing, so concluded it was probably a pinch flat (I had just hit a pothole). I installed a new tube, being careful to seat it properly to avoid pinches, and re-inflated. Within seconds the second tube was flat. That being my only spare tube and my only CO2 cartridge and it being dark and a very long walk home, I called the sag wagon (aka my wife). Back home, I removed the tire from the rim, turned it inside out, inspected carefully, and found nothing. Ditto with the rim and rim tape. And, I should add, these are virtually new tires and rims with barely a hundred kilometers on them. When I looked at the second tube that failed, I found this: 

It's exactly the right way to deal with it. If people passing you is dangerous for anyone, then you need to make it extremely inconvenient, and even illegal, for them to do so. Once you're beyond the complex road that makes it necessary for you to take the lane, be a good fellow and get to the side of the road and let them by. I've only very rarely encountered hostile reactions from drivers when I take a lane. The vast majority realize why you're doing it and actually appreciate it. "Oh, look! A predictable cyclist obeying the rules of the road! What do you make of that, dear?" "I don't know, never saw such a thing. But at least I know what he's going to do next." 

In addition to the previously mentioned benefits, recent wind tunnel testing performed by Specialized has shown that shaved legs will save about 50 to 82 seconds over a 40km TT...certainly not an inconsequential amount. 

General Note: Chains should match the speed they are manufactured for, in order to work correctly (ie, 11sp drivetrains require 11sp chains, etc). This is due to the different spacings on the cassette from one size to another: 11sp cassettes have narrower sprocket spacing than 10sp cassettes, so 11sp drivetrains require narrower chains as a result. Specific to SRAM: SRAM MTB: According to SRAM's compatibility chart, the XX1 chains are only compatible with 1x drivetrains. However, a similar note is not present for the X1 chains, so presumably those can be used with both 1x and 2x drivetrains and by that same logic, the PC 1130 chain should also be compatible with 1x11 drivetrains. SRAM Road: No, there doesn't appear to be any difference in chain compatibility between 1x and 2x drivetrains. Note that both the Force 22 and Force 1 product pages feature the same chain. 

Yes, the arms should support some of a rider's weight. However, outside of a hard effort, the hands should be light on the bars and the arms should be relaxed. I'm reminded of a brief quote from Wheelmen, 

An article on VeloNews about EPO use featured the following photo of Lance Armstrong from Stage 8 of the 2003 Tour de France: 

One of the things that has come up in reports during the first rest day in the Tour de France this year is that the first mountain stage, especially following the rest day, is a shock to the legs. Why is this, from a physiological level? What specific things can a rider do to more effectively make this transition? 

Take the plunge and try it! Either you'll find that you don't enjoy it or you'll have discovered a wonderful new aspect to cycling. Regardless, you're only out a race fee. Community The cycling community is just like that of any other sport. You have some people who are pros, those who were, some who wish they were, some who think they are and some who don't care. Within every group, you have the people who are out to crush everyone and those that just want to have fun. It becomes an incredibly complex and impossible to map ecosystem, but in the end it doesn't matter; what matters is that you are getting what you want to be getting out of the sport. Find a group of people who are interested in the same things as you and ride with them. If you enjoy it, great. If not, keep looking. I have one weekly group ride that turns into a hammerfest, while the next day I have one where we usually all hang out at the shop later. It is what you make it. If you're looking for "cycling buddies" who are also interested in racing, one option is to look around at some of the more race-focused bike shops in your area. See if they have group rides and jump into one! Technical competitiveness When I started racing, I was on a bike I bought used for $200. My current bike was purchased used for less than $1000. Both bikes have modern shifters, are 9 or 10sp, weigh around 20lbs and are more than adequate to keep pace with or beat people on bikes costing 10x as much, especially at the low- to mid-levels (Cat 3/4/5 in the US). From my experience (marketing departments to the contrary), the bike typically isn't the thing that holds a cyclist back. That being said, my advice would be to try to ensure your bike has these main advancements: 

Probably 17" but it depends on more than your height. More important is your inseam and your reach. You could be 5'8" and have very long legs in which case you probably want a 19", or you could be 5'8" with short legs and a long torso in which case you probably want a 17". The best bet, as always, is to go to a bike shop that will do a proper fit testing and let you try some different sizes. The right size is the bike that's most comfortable for you and there's really no way for anyone on the internet to tell you what that is based on your height. 

I noticed the same thing when I first got a B17. I fiddled with various angles and so forth, but in the end I found it's mainly just a matter of getting used to the smoother feel of leather as compared to the plastic you're used to. You slide over leather more easily, especially if you wear typical bike shorts, and this gives you the sensation that you're going to slide forward since you're not used to a smooth surface. But you won't. Your position in the saddle is maintained by your arms and core no matter what sort of saddle you have, not the saddle itself. The smoothness of a leather saddle is actually a benefit, not a drawback, and you'll come to appreciate it if you give it time. Yes, breaking in helps a bit but it's not necessary. Just getting used to the new feel is all that's necessary. After a lot of trial and error, I ended up setting my saddle perfectly level just as I had with my plastic saddles. The temptation to tilt the nose upward just because the material is smooth should be resisted, as you've already discovered.
