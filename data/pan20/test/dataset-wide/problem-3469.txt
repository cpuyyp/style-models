Firm 1's profit maximization problem is : \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{q_1} & \ p(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)q_1 - c(q_1) \end{eqnarray*} Firm 1's response to firm 2's and 3's quantity choices will satisfy the following: \begin{eqnarray*} p(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)q_1 - c'(q_1) = 0 \end{eqnarray*} Likewise, we'll get the implicit best response functions for the other firms as well. \begin{eqnarray*} p(q_1 + q_2 + q_3) + p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)q_i - c'(q_i) = 0 \end{eqnarray*} for each $i \in \{1,2 ,3\}$. There is a symmetric equilibrium of the above game if there exist $q^*$ such that \begin{eqnarray*} p(3q^*) + p'(3q^*)q^* - c'(q^*) = 0 \end{eqnarray*} To show that there exist one, consider the following function \begin{eqnarray*} g(q) = p(3q) + p'(3q)q - c'(q)\end{eqnarray*} Observe that $g(0) = p(0) - c'(0) > 0$. Also, given that $p(q)$ is decreasing and concave, there exist $\overline{q} > 0$ such that $p(\overline{q}) \leq 0$. Consequently, $g(\overline{q}) \leq 0$. Therefore, by intermediate value theorem, there exist $q^* \in [0,\overline{q}] $ such that $g(q^*) = 0$ i.e. \begin{eqnarray*} p(3q^*) + p'(3q^*)q^* - c'(q^*) = 0 \end{eqnarray*} Also, $g'(q) = 4p'(3q) + 3p''(3q)q - c''(q) < 0$. Since $g(q)$ is decreasing in $q$, $q^*$ is unique. So there is a unique symmetric equilibrium. To show that it is the only equilibrium, we'll show that there is no equilibrium where at least two of the firms choose different quantities. To do so, let us subtract the implicit best response function of firm 1 from that of firm 2, \begin{eqnarray*} p'(q_1 + q_2 + q_3)(q_2 - q_1) = c'(q_2) - c'(q_1) \end{eqnarray*} Notice that the above equality only holds for $q_2 = q_1$. This is because 

Player $1$'s utility maximization problem is the following : $$\max_{0 \leq t_{12} \leq T} \ \ \left(T-t_{12} + t_{12}t_{21}\right)^a \left(w(T-t_{12})\right)^{1-a}$$ An equivalent way to solve the above problem is maximizing the $\log$ of the objective i.e. one can solve $$\max_{0 \leq t_{12} \leq T} \ \ a\ln\left(T-t_{12} + t_{12}t_{21}\right) +(1-a)\ln \left(w\right) + (1-a)\ln \left(T-t_{12}\right) $$ Solving it we get the best response function of player 1 as \begin{eqnarray*} t_{12} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } t_{21} \leq\frac{1}{a} \\ \frac{(1-a)Tt_{21}}{(t_{21}-1)} & \text{if } t_{21} > \frac{1}{a} \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} Likewise, the best response function of player 2 is \begin{eqnarray*} t_{21} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } t_{12} \leq \frac{1}{a} \\ \frac{(1-a)Tt_{12}}{(t_{12}-1)} & \text{if } t_{12} \geq \frac{1}{a} \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} Solving the best responses, we get the following Nash Equilibria : $(t_{12}^*, t_{21}^*) = (0,0)$ and another one is $(t_{12}^{**}, t_{21}^{**}) = ((1-a)T+1,(1-a)T+1)$ provided $T \geq \frac{1}{a}$. 

\begin{eqnarray*} \displaystyle U(L) & = &\sum_{s=1}^{S}\pi_s U(Y_s) = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi_s(\alpha - Y_s)^2\right) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s=1}^{S} \left(\pi_s(\alpha^2 + Y_s^2-2\alpha Y_s)\right) \\ &=& -\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2\sum_{s=1}^{S} \pi_s + \sum_{s=1}^{S} \pi_sY_s^2-2\alpha \sum_{s=1}^{S} \pi_sY_s\right) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2 + \mathbb{E}(L^2)-2\alpha \mathbb{E}(L)\right) \\ &=& -\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2 + \mathbb{E}(L^2) - (\mathbb{E}(L))^2 + (\mathbb{E}(L))^2 -2\alpha \mathbb{E}(L)\right) \\ &=& -\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^2 + \mathbb{V}(L) + (\mathbb{E}(L))^2 -2\alpha \mathbb{E}(L)\right) \end{eqnarray*} So utility from the lottery only depends on expected value - $\mathbb{E}(L)$ and variance - $\mathbb{V}(L)$ of the state-contingent payoffs. 

Another counter example: $u_1(x_1, y_1) = 2x_1+y_1$ and $u_2(x_2, y_2)= x_2+2y_2$. Suppose the total endowment of $X$ and $Y$ in the economy is $(1,1)$. Consider the following two allocations: 

Demand $x(p, m)$ is the solution to the utility maximization problem: $\max\limits_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n_+} \ \ u(x) \\ \text{s.t.} \ \ p\cdot x \leq m$ where $p\in\mathbb{R}^n_{++}$ is price vector, and $m$ is the income. When we multiply both sides of the constraint in problem above by $\lambda > 0$, and look at the revised problem we get $\max\limits_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n_+} \ \ u(x) \\ \text{s.t.} \ \ \lambda p\cdot x \leq \lambda m$ Since this operation does not affect the constraint, the solution remains unaffected i.e. demand satisfy $x(\lambda p, \lambda m) = x(p, m) $ which shows that demand is homogeneous of degree 0 in $(p, m)$. So, this is always true for demand function. Given that $p_1 > 0$, we can take $\lambda = \frac{1}{p_1}$, and find $x\left(\frac{p}{p_1}, \frac{m}{p_1}\right)$ to get $x(p, m)$. It is helpful to note that for any function $f(p)$ that is homogeneous of degree $k > 0$, it is the case that $f(\lambda p) = \lambda^k f(p) \neq f(p)$ for $\lambda \neq 1$. 

Let us name three consumers A, B and C, and two goods X and Y. Equilibrium price vector $(p_x, p_y=1)$ and allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), (x_C, y_C))$ satisfy the following: Optimality Conditions (Allocation must solve the utility maximization problem of the three consumers, i.e. it must lie on the demand functions) 

$\mu_A = \sqrt{x_Ay_A}$ and $\mu_B = \sqrt{x_By_B}$ Solving the above system of equations we get the UPF as: $\mu_A + \mu_B = \sqrt{\omega_X\omega_Y}$. 

It can be easily shown that the indifference relation derived from the reflexive, transitive and complete weak preference relation in the way described above will be an equivalence relation. It is important because this relation partitions the entire commodity space into indifference classes, where two consumption vectors belong to a class if and only if the individual is indifferent between the two. These classes are also known as indifference curves. This further helps in solving related problems. 

Given that the utility maximization problem is: \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{\{y_j \geq 0 : 1\leq j\leq J\}} && \sum_{j=1}^{J} u(y_j) \\ \text{s.t.} && \sum_{j=1}^{J} p_jy_j \leq m\end{eqnarray*} where $p_j > 0$ for every $j$, and $m > 0$. If $u$ is convex and strictly increasing, then in optimum consumer will always spend all his money on the cheapest good. That is, buying $\frac{m}{p_1}$ units of commodity 1 when $p_1 \leq \min_j p_j$ will be utility maximizing for the consumer. Here is the proof: First of all note that in optimum consumer will never spend less than his income because his utility is increasing. So, we are left with bundles on which he spends all his income. Now any consumption bundle that costs exactly equal to his income can be written as the convex combination of the bundles of the type in which the consumer spends all his money on a single good. For example, in a two commodity case: Any $(y_1, y_2)$ on the budget line can be written as the convex combination of $\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right)$ and $\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right)$. Since, $u$ is convex, and the sum of convex functions is convex, so we also know that the utility $U$ is convex. By convexity of $U$, utility at the convex combination of the bundles of the type in which the consumer spends all his money on a single good is less than or equal to the convex combination of the utilities at those bundles, and that is in turn less than or equal to the maximum of the utilities at those bundles. This shows that the consumer can never lose by changing his choice to the bundle where he buys the cheapest bundle. For example: In the two commodity case, we can write any bundle any bundle $(y_1, y_2)$ on the budget line as $\lambda\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right)+(1-\lambda)\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right)$ where $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$. Therefore, by convexity of $U$, \begin{eqnarray*} U(y_1, y_2) = U\left(\lambda\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right)+(1-\lambda)\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right)\right) & \leq & \lambda U\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right)+(1-\lambda)U\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right) \\ & \leq & \max\left( U\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right),U\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right)\right)\end{eqnarray*} This implies that the utility is maximum at either $\left(\frac{m}{p_1}, 0\right)$ or $\left(0,\frac{m}{p_2}\right)$. Given that $U(y_1, y_2) = u(y_1)+u(y_2)$, it follows that it is maximum when one consumes the cheaper one. 

Use Roy's identity to find demand functions: $$\displaystyle x_1=-\frac{\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_1}}{\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} =-\frac{\alpha yp_1^{\alpha-1} p_2^\beta}{p_1^\alpha p_2^\beta}=-\frac{\alpha y }{p_1} $$ $$\displaystyle x_2=-\frac{\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_2}}{\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} =-\frac{\beta yp_1^{\alpha} p_2^{\beta-1}}{p_1^\alpha p_2^\beta}=-\frac{\beta y }{p_2} $$ Since $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = y$, from the above demand expressions we get $-\alpha -\beta = 1$. Demand equations above can also be rewritten as: $$x_1^{-\alpha} = (-\alpha y)^{-\alpha}p_1^\alpha$$ $$x_2^{-\beta} = (-\beta y)^{-\beta}p_2^\beta$$ Multiplying them we obtain the following: $$x_1^{-\alpha}x_2^{-\beta} = (-\alpha y)^{-\alpha}p_1^\alpha (-\beta y)^{-\beta}p_1^\beta = (-\alpha)^{-\alpha}(-\beta)^{-\beta}yp_1^\alpha p_2^\beta $$ Comparing it with the indirect utility function, we get the direct utility function as: $$u(x_1, x_2) = \frac{x_1^{-\alpha}x_2^{-\beta}}{(-\alpha)^{-\alpha}(-\beta)^{-\beta}}$$ 

If we allow $3\times 3$ games, then above is an example of the game that has exactly one pure strategy Nash equilibrium $(A, A)$ and at least one mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium. 

\begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x_1, x_2, l} && x_1x_2(1-l) \\ \text{s.t.} && p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \leq wl \\ && 0 \leq l\leq 1 \end{eqnarray*} Solution to this problem is \begin{eqnarray*}(x_1^*, x_2^*, l^*) = \left(\frac{w}{3p_1}, \frac{w}{3p_2}, \frac{2}{3}\right)\end{eqnarray*} 

Clearly, any price vector $(p_x, p_y)$ satisfying $p_x \leq 1$ and $p_y = 1$, and the allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B)) = ((100, 100), (50, 0))$ is the equilibrium. 

Utility maximization problem is \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n} && u(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \\ \text{s.t.} && \sum_{i=1}^n p_ix_i \leq M \\ && \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = X \\ && x_i\in\mathbb{Z}_+ \ \ \forall i\in\{1,2,\ldots, n\} \end{eqnarray*} If we ignore the budget constraint, the equation $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i = X$ has ${X+n-1\choose n-1}$ solutions. List them, sort them from high to low by utility, and then identify the highest one in the sorted list that also satisfy the budget constraint. If $u$ is strictly increasing, differentiable and quasi-concave on $\mathbb{R}_+^n$, then one can solve the utility maximization problem in the usual way by ignoring the $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = X$ constraint, and then inspect the integral solutions of $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = X$ that surrounds the solution of the utility maximization problem, and choose the best amongst them to get the final solution. 

Since demand equals supply holds for every price $p$, this simply means that every $p$ is an equilibrium price. However, the equilibrium allocation that $p$ supports varies with $p$. To be precise, price $p$ supports the allocation in which 1 consumes $\left(\frac{1+3p}{1+p}, \frac{1+3p}{1+p}\right)$ and 2 consumes $\left(\frac{3+p}{1+p}, \frac{3+p}{1+p}\right)$. 

Endowment of A is $$\omega_A = (0, 5)$$ and endowment of B is $$\omega_B = (10, 0)$$. Equilibrium price vector $(p_x, p_y)$ and allocation $((x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B))$ satisfy the following: Optimality Conditions (Allocation must solve the utility maximization problem of the two consumers, i.e. it must lie on the demand functions) 

I don't think it is true in a standard public good economy the question is referring to. Consider the following counterexample: Suppose $I = \{1,2\}$ and utility of the individual $i$ depends on his consumption of public good $(G)$ and private good $x_i$: $u_1(G, x_1) = 2\sqrt{G} + x_1$ and $u_2(G, x_2) = 2\sqrt{G} + x_2$, Also, the CRS technology used for production of public good uses private good as input: $G = f(x_0) = x_0$. If the society has only 4 units of private good in the beginning, then the set of feasible allocations can be written as $\{(G, x_1, x_2)\in\mathbb{R}^3_+: G+x_1+x_2 = 4\}$. Notice that the allocation $a_1 = (G, x_1, x_2) = (1,3,0)$ is Pareto efficient, but does not maximize the sum of utilities. The reason is that allocation $a_2 = (G, x_1, x_2) = (4,0,0)$ yields the higher sum. $\color{blue}{u_1(1,3) + u_2(1,0)} = 5+2 =7 \color{blue}{<} 8 = 4 + 4 = \color{blue}{u_1(4,0) + u_2(4,0)}$. 

Therefore, there is no equilibrium satisfying $q_2 \neq q_1$. Likewise, there is none satisfying $q_2 \neq q_3$ or $q_1 \neq q_3$. 

Clearly, any price vector $(p_x, p_y)$ satisfying $p_x > 0$ and $p_y = 0$ supports any of the allocations in the set $\{((0, y_A), (4, y_B))| 4 \leq y_B \leq 5, y_A+y_B = 5 \}$ as equilibrium. Now utility of A in all these competitive equilibria is 0, and B gets everything. B's utility has gone up to 4 in comparison to Scenario 1 where his utility was 0. This happened because he destroyed part of his endowment. 

Firm 1's objective is to maximize profits : $$\max_{q_1\geq 0} \ \ \left(a - b(q_1+q_2)\right)q_1 - cq_1$$ Solving the above problem, we get the best response function of firm 1 as $$q_1 = \dfrac{a - c - bq_2}{2b}$$ Firm 2's objective is to maximize revenue subject to the constraint that its profits are non-negative : $$\max_{q_2\geq 0} \ \ \left(a - b(q_1+q_2)\right)q_2$$ $$\text{s.t. }\left(a - b(q_1+q_2)\right)q_2 - cq_2 \geq 0$$ Solving the above problem, we get the best response function of firm 2 as \begin{eqnarray*} q_2 =\begin{cases} \dfrac{a - bq_1}{2b} & \text{if } a - bq_1 \geq 2c \\ \dfrac{a - c - bq_1}{b} & \text{if } a - bq_1 < 2c \end{cases}\end{eqnarray*} Solving the best response functions for $q_1$ and $q_2$ yields \begin{eqnarray*} (q_1^*, q_2^*) = \begin{cases} \left(\dfrac{a-2c}{3b}, \dfrac{a+c}{3b}\right) & \text{if } a \geq 2c\\ \left( 0, \dfrac{a-c}{b}\right) & \text{if } a < 2c \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} 

We solve the utility maximization problem of the individual whose utility function is $u(c, l) = c - \frac{l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$ to get the supply function. The problem can be written as: \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{c,l} & & c - \frac{l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma} \\ \text{s.t.} && c \leq wl\end{eqnarray*} In this problem, we are assuming that the only source of income of the consumer is his wage income. When we solve the problem we get the labor supply function as: \begin{eqnarray*} l(w) = w^{1/\gamma}\end{eqnarray*} The elasticity of labor supply curve is this case is constant and equal to $\frac{1}{\gamma}$. Supply will be elastic if $0 < \gamma < 1$ and inelastic if $\gamma > 1$. 

Utility maximization problem is: $\max\limits_{(x_1, x_2)\in\mathbb{R}^2_+} 4x_1 + 14x_2 \\ \text{s.t.} \ \ m = \frac{1}{2}x_1 + \frac{3}{2}x_2$ This problem can be converted into an optimization problem involving just one variable $x_1$: $\max\limits_{x_1} 4x_1 + 14\left[\frac{2}{3}\left(m - \frac{1}{2}x_1\right)\right] \\ \text{s.t.} \ \ 0 \leq x_1 \leq 2m$ Differentiating the objective $4x_1 + 14\left[\frac{2}{3}\left(m - \frac{1}{2}x_1\right)\right]$ with respect to $x_1$, we get $\left(4- \frac{14}{3}\right) = \frac{-2}{3} < 0$. So we observe that the objective is decreasing in $x_1$. Therefore optimal choice must be the smallest $x_1$ we can have i.e. $x_1 = 0$ and hence $x_2 = \frac{2m}{3}$. 

Suppose $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is the Nash Equilibrium of the game $G$ consisting of players $\{1,2\}$ having strategy sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ and the payoff functions $u_1:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $u_2:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Consider the game $G'$ in which everything else is same as $G$ except that the payoff functions are $v_1:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $v_2:A_1\times A_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined as: $v_1(a_1, a_2) = u_1(a_1, a_2) + d_1$ and $v_2(a_1, a_2) = u_2(a_1, a_2) + d_2$. We will now show that $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is also the Nash Equilibrium of $G'$. Since $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is the Nash Equilibrium of $G$, \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*)) & & \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2)) & & \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} The above can also be rewritten as \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) + d_1 \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*)) + d_1 & & \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) + d_2 \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2)) + d_2 & & \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} Because $d_1$ and $d_2$ are constants, we can take them inside the expectation and rewrite the above inequalities as: \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) + d_1) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*) + d_1) & & \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*) + d_2) \geq \mathbb{E}(u_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2) + d_2) & & \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} By definition of $v_1$ and $v_2$, \begin{eqnarray*} \mathbb{E}(v_1(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(v_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2^*)) & & \forall \sigma_1 \in \Delta (A_1) \\ \mathbb{E}(v_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)) \geq \mathbb{E}(v_2(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2)) & & \forall \sigma_2 \in \Delta (A_2) \end{eqnarray*} Therefore, $(\sigma_1^*, \sigma_2^*)$ is also the Nash Equilibrium of $G'$. 

Let $P = \alpha A + (1-\alpha) B$ where $A$ and $B$ are returns (random) from the two assets, and $P$ is their portfolio. Variance of portfolio $P$ can therefore be written as \begin{eqnarray*} \sigma^2_P & = & \alpha^2 \sigma^2_A + (1-\alpha)^2 \sigma^2_B + 2\alpha (1-\alpha)\text{Cov}(A, B) \\ & \leq &\alpha^2 \sigma^2_A + (1-\alpha)^2 \sigma^2_B + 2\alpha (1-\alpha)\sigma_A\sigma_B \\ & = &(\alpha\sigma_A + (1-\alpha)\sigma_B)^2 \\ & \leq & (\alpha \max(\sigma_A, \sigma_B) + (1-\alpha)\max(\sigma_A, \sigma_B))^2 \\ & = & \max(\sigma_A^2, \sigma_B^2)\end{eqnarray*} 

One of the fastest ways to calculate Gini Coefficient for any data set is running the following code: Gini Coefficient and Lorenz Curve - in Python When you will run this code, you will get the Gini Coefficient as 0.266666666667. Code will also generate the Lorenz curve.
