(Note: The Taepodong-X is apparently one of the more uncommon names for the Hwasong-10, or Musudan missile.) A single reference to the range of a North Korean IRBM, with data that is freely available online, does not speak well of the quality of Deagel.com's research and reporting. This is backed up by the Deagel.com entry on the Taepodong-X, which contains no information that could be easily found by reading the Wikipedia article. 

Time Magazine reported on the statement made by President Trump with a historical footnote involving the first President of the United States. 

tl;dr: it is impossible to know for sure if it will cost President Trump "a fortune" since he has not released his tax returns, but it is very unlikely that he will come out behind under either the House or Senate tax plans, and much more likely that both he and his company will come out ahead. The few areas where President Trump stands to have to pay more in taxes are more than counterbalanced by huge tax breaks in others.

Every source that I was able to find online is unsourced, apparently said in a private conversation. As a wise man once said 

Steemit.com vastly overstates the reliance of Intelligence sources on deagel.com, to the point of outright lying. Deagel.com is not a reliable source of information and has a history of making doom-and-gloom predictions regarding population numbers and GDP levels, dating back at least as far as April 2009. In addition, their "model" assumes an economic crisis exponentially worse than any ever seen in the world today, and not a nuclear war or pandemic (which would reasonably be the only methods to achieve the sorts of depopulation numbers predicted.) The website shows clear bias against government organizations as well. 

Story 2 : The Minister The story lists a Dr. Morgan as the Minister of the Rosedale Methodist Church in Winnipeg, Canada during the time of the Titanic sinking. There was indeed a Charles Morgan who was the Cleric of the Rosedale Methodist Church in Winnipeg in 1912. While there are places online that claim this story to be true, no trustworthy sources seem to be available. None cite their sources, and most of the stories seem to be copy/pasted from each other. The only place where I was able to find anything to be sourced was on Atlantis Rising Magazine which claims that the Toronto Sun was the originator. A google search points to the Lowell Sun actually being the source, although from the (admittedly terrible) OCR job on the page available as a free sample, it seems to be the same version of the story seen on other pages available online. The article was written in 1975, decades after this episode came out. 

(Wikiquote source if the video gets taken down) I've never heard this statistic before, and I would normally be disinclined to believe it as something made up by a movie. However, The Big Short seems to go out of its way to be as factually accurate as possible, with scenes that cut away from the story entirely to explain economic principles to the watcher. Since there is not a source for the fact presented in the movie but the movie tries to be accurate, I have to ask if this is literally accurate, if there is a context that needs to be injected, or if it was made up for the purposes of the movie. 

Estate Tax The Estate Tax is a tax paid upon the transfer of an Estate of a deceased person. For 99.8% of deaths in the United States, this tax has no effect, and the tax only hits the very top earners. Both plans aim to double the amount exempt, moving from approx. $5.5 Million for single persons and $11 Million for married couples. The House bill goes a step further, repealing the Estate Tax entirely by 2024. This change will not directly benefit President Trump, but would greatly benefit his children. 

Individual Tax Brackets Except for very low income filers under the House plan, effective tax rates are expected to fall across the board under both plans. The two plans differ in how they achieve this, with the House plan leaning more towards making larger tax brackets and reducing the number of brackets from 7 to 4, while the Senate plan keeps the income ranges largely the same but reduces the rate on each bracket. If we presume that President Trump is filing jointly, unless he is making less than $18,650, his effective income tax rate will fall. 

There is a process that the IRS will follow before any garnishment of wages will take place. According to Nolo, in an article titled "Can the IRS garnish my wages for taxes?", they explain the process that the IRS goes through. 

Some images source the quote to "The Mind Unleashed", which as far as I can tell is a pseudo-scientific site that has never actually included those words on its site. RationalWiki describes it as 

As an aside, the NBPP, despite its name, has no connection to the Black Panther Party of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Notably, the NBPP advocates for Black Supremacy, and is described as a racist organization by both the ADL and the SPLC, whereas the BPP was notably anti-racist. According to a web archive of the BPP website 

There are a number of provisions in the tax bill that would change the way the US tax system would work. There are differences between the Senate and House plans, for the most part they are just a matter of numbers being different and differences on parts of the plan phasing out after a number of years. 

In reality, a single email leaked from Stratfor Enterprises, LLC references Deagel.com. Note that this was a single email in a leak from the company of over 5 million emails, and is also the only email obtained by WikiLeaks that references the phrase "deagel" in its entire database. The context of the 'deagel.com' reference is telling as well. The reference is in an attached document, describing the capabilites of the North Korean Taepo Dong-X IRBM 

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that there is no conclusive evidence that Ginkgo Biloba has the health effects described by manufacturers.

Story 4 : The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility TIME Magazine wrote an article about the similarities between the book and the actual disaster. While there are some eerie similarities between the two stories, it seems to be more a case of Pareidolia than anything else. Notable excerpts from the TIME article: 

Mr. Hoover and Mr. Paderewski met at Stanford in 1892 under the pretext of a concert. Mr. Hoover had difficulty in coming up with all of the funds in order to pay for the concert after scheduling conflicts. Mr. Paderewski covered the bill upon discovering this The friendship that resulted from this meeting was a factor in delivering foreign Aid to Poland after World War 1

This article was published October 23rd, 2011, implying that Mrs. Lee was 90 in late 2011. If she was, she would had to have be either 95 or 96 at the time of her passing in July 2017. There doesn't seem to be a source on her actual birthday, with Wikipedia only listing it as 1921. However, this fact seems to have been recently added, and it appears that Wikipedia itself had the fact wrong for an unknown amount of time. It seems like this may be a case of Citogenesis, where Wikipedia had incorrect information that was then used by news reports and then validated by those same news reports. 

Note that even in the worst case in the article (The Fiat 500L) the depreciation rate over the first year seems to be closer to 3.5% than the 7% found in the claim.

There is no publicly available information that implies that Trump predicted a Gillespie loss before the actual election, and it appears that he only distanced himself from Gillespie after the VA Governor election.
