The source for the story linked within the Karl Hess Wikipedia page seems to be from the book "We Won’t Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader" by Robert W. McGee and David M. Gross. The relevant section is from pages 437 to 438, reproduced here. 

Malik Zulu Shabazz was (2001-2013) the former head of the New Black Panther Party. The NBPP is described by the Anti-Defamation League as 

The EPA, in a study titled Rare Earth Elements: A Review of Production, Processing, Recycling, and Associated Environmental Issues, says 

However, there are two things that negate the argument made by Institute for Energy Research. 1. The numbers quoted for radioactive waste generation is an apples to oranges comparison. The quoted number for Wind Turbines is the amount of waste generated by producing and constructing a Wind Turbine. Once the turbine is constructed, the Turbine should no longer produce radioactive waste over its lifetime. Many different sources claim different values, but the general consensus is that a Wind Turbine should last from 12 to 25 years. While there may be a large upfront cost for the Turbines, there is no more waste produced after it comes online. The quoted number for Nuclear plants, on the other hand, is the amount of waste produced per year by operating the plant. The plant must continue to produce that waste or it will shut off. The article, by comparing these two numbers, can be translated to the claim that 

For interest, Ljungqvist (2009) plotted a number of paleoclimate proxies for a number of different regions. Remember, many of these will only include data up to about 1950 or so. In many of these records, current temperatures are lower than during their medieval warm peak. However, the exact time of that peak varies - which probably helps to explain why many locations contain a MWP and yet it is less pronounced in larger scale hemispheral or global records. 

So there is a speed improvement to the Dvorak keyboard over the QWERTY keyboard. It's just not a very big one. 

He wanted to sell more Australian-made cars, but the clear implication there is that Japanese cars could be found in RSL parking lots in the 60s. Roger Pulver's article for Japan times may have been the source for Abbott's statement there: 

As we can see, looking at the whole data set rather than a carefully selected subset, the upwards trend continues unabated. 

McKitrick's report is plagued with factual errors, misunderstandings of the IPCC process, and misunderstandings of the data. Of course, that certainly doesn't mean that the IPCC process as it stands is perfect - for example, the InterAcademy Council review highlighted a number of issues with the IPCC process. I have generally not considered here the points on which McKitrick merely echoed the IAC's review. 

Salon commissioned a study comparing paper towels with hot-air dryers, which found that a hand-dryer meant 9-20g per press of CO2 emissions (depending on the wattage), and paper towels were 28g per sheet - so it's a question of how many presses or sheets it takes. The resulting article is here. Another study - consider cautiously as it was conducted by a company producing hot-air dryers - found similar results, concluding: 

The IRS supposedly was communicating with Mr. Hess via mail. However, despite paper records of this correspondence, there seems to be no proof offered besides the word of Mr. Hess. The IRS never told Mr. Hess that he "no longer would be permitted to possess money" With the attached IRS form above, the IRS is not permitted to put a lien on 100% of a person's income, and written correspondence would be proof of this threat. There is no discussion detailed in the book where Mr. Hess tells the IRS "without money he could not buy food and would soon die". The whole incident was started because Mr. Hess decided he did not want to pay taxes anymore after being audited. Mr. Hess, in the book, believed that he was audited in retaliation for "his service to a losing presidential candidate." Note that Mr. Hess was not an advisor, or a close aide, but a speechwriter for Barry Goldwater. Also note that the audit rate around that time, according to this article, was 5.6% of all Americans. There is no indication that, even if all of the above were true, that the IRS actually garnished 100% of his wages. 

The main problem with statistics like these is that there is no one definition of "mass shooting" and thus, by adjusting your parameters, can make the number be whatever you want to fit a narrative. 

Story 1 : Newlyweds on Honeymoon Unless details of the story have been extremely modified, this story is false. Upon watching the story, several inconsistencies arrive. 

However, as was revealed on Deep Climate, this is not correct. The emails were very selectively quoted to imply that the discussion was about the divergence problem, when actually they concerned discrepancies between the reconstructions during the 17th and 19th centuries. Removing the late-20th century data would not have "fixed" that. For example, McIntyre (in the post referenced by McKitrick) quotes Climategate email 0938018124.txt, sent by Michael Mann to Keith Briffa, Chris Folland, and Phil Jones. The relevant paragraphs are below, with the parts that McIntyre choose to include in italics. I have also added bold for emphasis: [Jivlain: Briffa's series is warmer in the 17th and 19th centuries, and colder in the late 20th century. Again, it's clear that they are discussing the 17th and 19th centuries here] We would need to put in a few words in this regard. Otherwise, the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and, thus, can undermine faith in the paleoestimates. I don't think that doubt is scientifically justified, and I'd hate to be the one to have to give it fodder! 

Next, McKitrick discusses figure 2.21 from the Third Assessment Report. In this, he claims that post-1960 data was deleted from Briffa's reconstruction (see below) in order to mask the "divergence problem" known to affect tree ring temperature proxies in the latter half of the 20th century. McKitrick cites a number of climategate emails, claiming that they relate to the divergence problem. 

While the numbers provided by the sources seem to be strictly correct, they are lacking a significant amount of context. Once this context is injected into the discussion, the manufacture of Wind Turbines does not create as much radiation as Nuclear waste. 

A cursory reading of the CDC report on uranium says, simply, the toxicity will kill you before the radiation does. So any possible consumption of uranium on the part of Mr. Winsor must have natually been low enough that he did not poison himself chemically, as evidenced by the fact that he was still alive to record the video. 

Mr. Disney, at the time, was engaged in his second "Save Disney" campaign, going so far as to launch the (now defunct) website SaveDisney.com (Example Snapshot from Wayback Machine 02 Feb 2005) (Wayback Machine Archive of SaveDisney.com). Mr. Disney believed that the company was headed in the opposite direction and was drifting, as seen in this letter written to the board of directors in Sept 2004. 

Roy Disney, nephew to founder Walt Disney was a stockholder of the company, holding a non-insignificant number of shares of the company itself (Wikipedia reports it as approximately 1% of the company at the time of his death, but the citation link is broken.) In 2004, upset at the results of a shareholder election, Mr. Disney sued The Walt Disney Company for access to voting records in the board election and the right to disseminate the information. 

However, in the midst of all this, the scientific community made statements that contradicted the White House position. For example, in 2006 the world's largest general scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, put out a statement saying: 

In 2005 the Joint Science Academies, a group of 11 national scientific societies, including the US National Academy of Sciences, stated that: 

The next issue McKitrick has is with the number of authors who were also associated with the World Wildlife Fund's "Climate Witness campaign". 

Skeptical Science has an excellent response has an excellent point-by-point response to the WSJ letter. I would really like to highlight Skeptical Science's wonderful "escalator" graphic illustrating the difference between the long-term trend and short-term variation: 

Studies that have ever been published or scrutinised outside razor companies seem to be rather difficult to come by. The best I could find was Measurement of beard hair removal efficacy using image analysis, a study conducted by researchers at Gillette (kudos to Solveig_A on Reddit for fetching the full-text for me). Now, a warning: this study's primary focus was not actually about comparing two razors, but on techniques for finding statistically significant results even for marginal effects were to conduct such a study. That can make reading it a bit obtuse (I shall not get into why they might be motivated to conduct such a study...). The first two experiments compare different types of shaving foam using a twin blade and a single-blade razor, respectively. They do not include results in such a way as to make direct comparison possible. However, the third experiment compared a single-blade and a twin-blade razor (Gillette's Trac I and Trac II razors, respectively) with the same type of shaving foam. According to their data, the twin-bladed razor was 1.6% more effective than the single-bladed razor, but that they could not reject the null hypothesis (that they were equally effective) at the α=0.05 significance level. In short, this does not represent compelling evidence that a razor with two blades is more effective than a razor with one blade, which does not bode well for the claim that five blades are more effective than three. Cecil Adams, writing for The Straight Dope, cites studies by Consumers' Research magazine which consistently failed to find a benefit for twin blades, whilst noting that the single-bladed razors tended to last for more shaves than twin-bladed razors.
