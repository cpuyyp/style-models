You can see the problem: the interpolation counts bins and assumes a width of 1. Next, I did a small test to see what I'd get: 

This would not be a giant version of eLISA, but a small (and complicated) one. The distance between the LISA satellites will be 1 million kilometers, while the moon is on average 380.000km from Earth. So that arm would be less than half as long. Geosynchronous orbit is at 36.000km, not even 10% of the distance to the moon. The difference in length between your proposed detector arms is much shorter than the coherence length of any laser, so your interferometer would not work. Further problems: 

There are some differences in the required surface accuracy (imperfections significantly smaller in scale than the observed wavelength do not matter) and surface composition - the ALMA dishes are solid metal, whereas the FAST dish is perforated. This works because as long as the holes are smaller than the wavelength, the incoming radio waves see it as solid. The receivers used to convert incoming photons to electricity for both telescopes work on the same principles. Practically, it is much more difficult for ALMA due to the high frequencies at the edge of the far-infrared spectrum. ALMAs shortest wavelengths are just a little too long for receivers used in infrared or optical telescopes to work, and almost too short for normal radio receivers to work. 

The mirrors, clock and you are all in the same reference frame and your relative velocities are zero. The speed the whole shebang is traveling at relative to something else is irrelevant. So the clock on board the ship with you will calmly pass the seconds just as you'd expect an object at rest relative to you to do. 

Last time I checked Carl Bender's lectures on mathematical physics were available on YouTube if it's of interest to anyone and these include asymptotic analysis. 

We don't know that. It's an assumption, and not one I would make. I would not even make it about Earth. 

That's meaningless. All light is electromagnetic radiation. A finite part of the infinitely large range of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light. So you should talk about EM radiation and to discuss the visible spectrum just say visible spectrum. Stars emit lots of energy at frequencies that are outside the visible range. 

When the first black holes formed ( and many other things ) are things we predict from theoretical models of the development of the universe. They are no proven facts, but better classed as speculative predictions based on theories. Different theories give different predictions. The way it works ( broadly ) is this : We try and develop theoretical models of the universe's creation and early development that will develop into a universe that matches what ours looks like. Doing this has led to such controversial concepts as string theory, which are not proven facts in a scientific sense, but theories subject to ongoing investigation. We try and verify ( or disprove ) theories by comparing what they predicts with what we see. So these "histories" should be considered as "best guesses" to some extent. The approximate date of the Sun's formation, for example, is based on our current best models for the evolution of stellar bodies like the sun, which of course are based on our current best measurements of whatever we can measure in relation to it. For history related to objects we can examine in more detail, like stuff on Earth, some of which came from space, we can perform detailed analysis and look for patterns in related objects and areas. This makes estimates dating from the start of life on Earth on reasonably good. So the far distant history beyond that is concerned we're relying primarily on models driven by astronomical observations and the law of physics we regard as "safe". 

Lastly, it is not clear to me how you want to replace precision measurement by calculation. What is PLL? How do you get meaningful interference patterns with lasers of different wavelengths? Also note that the "exact distance", if you want to count waves, must be better than half the wavelength of your laser, so a few hundred nanometers. At the distance of the moon, that is better than $1 : 10^{15}$ (hope that calculation is correct). 

so they seem to have repeat observations a bit more often than once a month. Cepheids have a period of typically 2 to 45 days (says german Wikipedia - didn't find it in the english article). If your sampling is regular, you should be able to get a decent light curve for at least some Cepheids. Complete guesswork on my part: Apparently, longer period Cepheids are redder at the minimum. Perhaps they use that to distinguish between the actual period and higher harmonics? 

Basics: FAST is a "classic" filled aperture telescope. This means it consists of a single large dish that focuses incoming radio waves on a single receiver (this is simplified). In contrast, ALMA is an interferometer: Many (> 60) dishes each focus incoming radiation on their own receiver. The relative positions of the individual telescopes is known to great precsion, and both amplitude and phase of the incoming radiation measured, which allows astronomers to combine several or all of the telescopes for a single observation. The maximum achievable resolution is then not determined by the diameter of a telescope but by the distance between those furthest apart. (Again, this is greatly simplified; interferometry is complicated.) In principle, FAST could also become part of a huge interferometer called VLBA. Wavelength: FAST is a "classic" radio telescope, observing in the centimeter to meter wavelength range. ALMA is a sub-mm telescope operating at smaller wavelengths of 0.3 mm to about 1 cm. Resolution: since the resolution is $ \propto \lambda / d$, with $\lambda$ the wavelength and $d$ the diameter of the telescope, ALMA has a much higher resolution - smaller $\lambda$ and greater $d$. ALMAs resolution is given as 10 milliarcseconds, while in the ideal case FASTs is $1.22 \cdot 0.1 / 500 \cdot( 180 / \pi \cdot 3600) = 50$ arcseconds at 10 cm wavelength. For comparison, according to wikipedia the unaided human eye has a resolution of about 60 arcseconds. Sensitivity: 

Black holes (even SMBs) are actually very small objects on an astronomical scale and in practical terms probably very little would happen. There would be some perturbations of stellar orbits within the formation they were in, but unless there was a fairly close approach very little would happen and on the scale of the entire formation the changes would affect only a small number of objects and not the overall "shape". To put this in perspective, Sag. A* has a mass of about 4,000,000 solar masses. Sounds big (is big :-) ). But the Large Magellanic Cloud has a mass of about 10,000,000,000 solar masses (or about 2500 time larger than Sag. A*). The dominant gravitational field is still that associated with the LMC itself, not that of Sag A*. I think a good analogy would be a bullet fired into a lake. Sure, it can cut a path through one isolated region and cause disturbance close to that path, but the bulk of the lake will be undisturbed apart from a slight ripple. The Small Magellanic Cloud is still a pretty large mass at about 6,500,000,000 solar masses, so still roughly 1,400 times more massive than Sag. A*. Again, we're talking bullet in lake territory. 

No, the more I read about it, the more difficult it seems to be. In principle, if you sample regularly and often, you should eventually get a light curve, unless the period is the same as or a multiple of your sampling period. It's not easy to find how often GAIA observes a given patch of sky, but here it says that after one year of observing 

First off, I'm not going to calculate an answer to the "significance level of 1%" part. This is more a rule of thumb kind of answer. We're moving in a spaceship and want to see 

Atmospheric transmission: FAST observes in a wavelength regime in which our atmosphere is quite transparent. In contrast, the ALMA dishes are located in one of the driest deserts of the world at an altitude of over 5000 m, in order to minimize the effects of water vapour in the atmosphere. Collecting area: FAST has a much larger collecting area. Also (I'm uncertain in this point, please correct this if I'm wrong) you lose some sensitivity when doing interferometry compared to just pooling the collecting areas of the single telescopes in ALMA. 

The header of a FITS file is ASCII, and points you to further information. Calling directs you to "'Astronomy and Astrophysics', volume 376, page 359; bibcode: 2001A&A...376..359H". A software to view FITS images is ds9 (yes, that makes it hard to google...). Alternatively, there's skycat. Both can be used to view and do basic analysis on FITS images. For FITS binary tables, it is probably best to write your own analysis software. For a quick look, fv might do the job. Accessing the data yourself If you want to write your own software for analysis, take a look at either cfitsio, a C library for reading and writing FITS files, or pyfits, a python module which does the same and which seems to have merged with the astropy software package. The cfitsio page in the link above has links to documentation on both the cfitsio library and the FITS standard in general. 

Wikipedia quotes $0.1542\pm 0.0045$ solar radii which is $107276\,km$ with an error of about $3130\, km$. They also give a reference to a 2017 paper available on Arxiv Proxima's orbit around Alpha Centauri, P. Kervella, F. Th√©venin, C. Lovis that gives this value. Wolfram's estimate is too far off to be an experimental error, IMO, and I think someone has just inadvertently used the diameter (twice the radius) rather than the radius. 

You are, I think, imagining the light as if it was directed out from a point, with directions of photons outward from the center. What actually happens is that the light is emitted from every point on the surface and what's more every point on the surface can send light in any and all directions. So the Sun is a diffuse source of light, not a point source of light. 

Your understanding of the mass of anti-particles is likely the problem. They have positive mass, just like particles, because they are particles. 

You might want to consult this Wikipedia page on the formation and future of our solar system and galaxy. Two events to note : 

The model you're discussing is really best thought of as a mathematical exploration, rather than a practical proposal of any kind. I would suggest the authors are disproving the viability of Krasnikov tubes rather than anything else. What was done was to try and fix problems with the previous model, but in doing so the authors ( to their credit ) show that they cannot bypass the fundamental problems making such a system unrealisable in practice. 

Like the other answer stated, stars usually emit a good approximation to black body radiation. However, under certain conditions, a star can emit monochromatic microwaves. This is known as a MASER. For this to happen, the star has to be either very cool (since the emission is from molecular gas) or embedded in a star forming region - in the latter case, it's not the actual star emitting the radiation but the molecular cloud it is embedded in. Now, the "normal" starlight is still present even if you have a MASER, and the emission is highly directional. So you might not see the MASER if you're looking from the wrong direction at the star, and it will not be purely monochromatic, but the MASER emission might be quite dominant. 

Warning: I never worked with spectra, and I don't have a complete answer. Anyway, here's how I understand it: A spectrograph has a resolution $R = \Delta \lambda / \lambda$ that tells us how well it can distinguish light of different wavelengths. VIMOS from the paper has a resolution from 200 to 2500. With the same flux from the source and for a low-resolution spectrograph, you get more photons per wavelength bin than for a high-resolution one. This means you'll also get better SNR. So, giving SNR / wavelength makes inherent sense. Here's where I'm very unsure: giving a SNR / $(0.1$nm$)$ should be equivalent to a magnitude limit, if the spectral energy distribution is the same. Or it could be a minimum quality criterion on the spectrum - stop taking data as soon as the SNR is reached. 

The moon has dark and bright areas. When it is visible in the daytime the bright areas appear roughly as bright as clouds, but the dark areas have no light to add to the scene and we are just left with the blue light from the sky generally. The sky blue is not as bright as the clouds or the moon, at least when it's visible like this (typically near the end of day and early morning) so it does not conceal the bright clouds or the moon's brighter parts. 

For gravity the force is : $$F=\frac {G M_1 M_2} {r^2}$$ But the acceleration : $$a=\frac F {M_2} =\frac {G M_1 } {r^2}$$ and this is the same for all bodies as it depends only on the primary's mass ($M_1$). 

Quakes and other large scale geological activity ( and indeed running water ! ) cause no end of trouble for mining operations. Much better to be able to sit on a nice quiet rock in space without all that craziness going on. We have, at this time, no real basis for saying one way or another, that there are not mineral concentrations. If all I let you do was dig a few meter deep boreholes in the surface of the Earth at random locations, what are the odds you would know anything about mineral concentrations for mining ? 

In this image you can see a small source in red, and the resulting lensed image in green. Note that the increase in brightness is purely an effect of the size of the lensed image, not more flux per area. If we assume that the blue circle is the size of the star, we can see that any lensing happening while the planet transits its star will simply stretch parts of a bright uniform background into other parts of the same bright uniform background. Of course, the extent of the lensed image here is greatly exaggerated in order to be able to show any lensing features at all. With a planet in front of a star you would not even get multiple images. 

The half-light radius doesn't change if you go from an upper end of 1000 to 100 or even to 10. It does change quite dramatically, though, if you change the resolution from 1 to 0.1 to 0.01. If we increase it to 0.001, it starts to slowly stabilize. This brings us to the next problem: These are the results I get when I increase the resolution: 

The most comprehensive catalogue of strong gravitational lenses that I am aware of is the CASTLeS database with about 120 lens systems. Several of them have extended features, arcs, etc., while others are point sources. They provide the redshifts of lens and source where available, as well as time delays between multiple images and the velocity dispersion (a proxy for the mass) of the lens for a few. You would have to create a comparison dataset without strong lensing yourself, but that should not be difficult: Go to Hubble's Ultra Deep Field web page, download the images with the same filters as used in CASTLeS and cut out likely looking galaxies. The UDF contains mostly very high-redshift galaxies, so the chance of accidentally picking a strong-lens system is very slim. (Disclaimer: I've only ever used ACS UDF images, not the NICMOS ones; if it's too hard, just skip the IR data.)
