The mass of a single habitable planet is small relative to the mass of a solar system. Slightly less so if you eliminate the star. Taking that planet apart to provide more orbiting solar collection is relatively unimportant -- in our solar system, the mass of the Earth would be a rounding error. If we did have a incomplete Dyson sphere (from disassembling the other planets), the amount of time we'd be blocked from the sun, and the power needed to generate a "flashlight" that would replace the sun during that time, is pretty low. Assuming that the incomplete Dyson sphere blocks the sunlight no more than it would if it was randomly constructed, only 0.000000001% of the energy it collects would be required to be emitted by a "solar flashlight" to replace the sunlight that it blocks from reaching the Earth. There may be inefficiencies here, but we have lots of zeros to eat up said inefficiencies. Note that using more energy on Earth than we receive from the Sun is relatively infeasible without building geological scale radiators: keeping a high-energy civilization cool on a plant is tricky. You could deliver it more efficiently than the above "solar flashlight" plan, and the blocking of the sun's rays by the partial Dyson sphere might be well worth it. I speak about blocking the sun's light as being a problem, as that is about the only one I can think of from having a Dyson Sphere between the Earth and the Sun. Mass wise, the entire rest of the solar system being used to construct a Dyson Sphere within Earth's orbit wouldn't cause any orbital issues: Jupiter is 0.1% of the Sun's mass, and the rest of the solar system is dross. A 0.1% increase in the sun's effective mass might be detectable, but I doubt it would be significant. 

Out of the way Simply put, don't block their fleet's way. Your main reason to be invaded is your strategic location, so just offer it to any passer-by. Sweden let German pass, so they were cool. Thailand and Belgium (in WW1) didn't, so they got invaded. Simple. Everyone's friend Again, look at Sweden and Thailand. While they let the Axis force pass, they also harboured Allies spies, so everyone just cool with them. Your planet could act like an espionage hub for everyone, a neutral ground for some secret diplomacy, a safe haven for refugees from all sides. You could also create some small organizations that align with different faction, but secretly be control by the goverment. Summary To put it simple, make they understand that your value as an independent planet is much higher than as someone's pawn. Give them what they want the most, then give some unique bonus that allow them to look over you. 

1000 kN of force, applied fast enough that the target isn't just "moved back" by it. Let us assume that this means that the punch force extends over about a chest-thickness -- 20 cm -- to get an idea of what happens. This is 200 kJ. If the energy was turned perfectly into kinetic energy over an entire 100 kg target, we get 63 m/s, or 227 km/h. f = ma; 1000 kN / 100 kg is 10 km/s^2, or ~1000 gravitates of acceleration. 63 m/s / 10 km/s^2 is 0.0063 seconds. Which means the fist is moving at an average of about 32 m/s or 114 km/h -- in practice, the fist will have to change speed to provide a uniform 1000 kN force. (a fist that moves at a fixed speed, without any give, regardless of what is in its way, will inflict unbounded force) So if the target was wearing perfect body armor that distributed the impact over the entire body, and used fluid to keep pressure up -- the target would probably still die. The highest g-force survived by a human is 214. Without the super-armor, you can approximate this by driving at high way velocities and throwing a lead fist-sized ball at someone. That won't work perfectly, because it will be slowed down by the impact. But it is an experiment Mythbusters can do. Alternatively we can do math: Bone has a shear strength of ~50 MPa -- if the fist is 30 cm^2, 1000 kN is ~1E11 Pa, or 100 MPa. Flesh has less shear strength than Bone, so the fist won't pull the rest of the target along -- it will penetrate. We could presume that about half of the force will spread as it shears through the body, and the rest will "pop" through. So you'll end up with your fist sticking through a body that is flying away at about 44 m/s or 160 km/hour. Ick. The G-forces suffered by the rest of the target in this situation are about 600 Gs; so even if the fist-sized hole didn't kill you, you'd be dead. 

So in my world, there is something called magic energy: a form of energy that can be control and, you know, do magic stuff. Like normal energy, they can not be created or destroyed, but only change form. At somepoint in history, my human learned how to "harvest" energy in the surrounding and transform them into magic. These energy input can be heat, wind, sound, light or biological etc. And here the question. (Disclaimer: it may sound basic or even stupid, but i just can't wrap my head around) "Can you darken the sky by (purely) harvesting too much light energy?" This mage harvest energy in a 30-meter radius, and light energy will immediately transform when they enter the zone. Would it result in a 30-meter dome of shade in the midnoon? I understand that it would mean a tremendous amount of energy, but this mage can do that. it could be equal to hundreds of the Hiroshima bomb and still be okay: the scale is not a problem. 

Mine the lift-stuff. I asked the OP for clarification. Here is the response: $URL$ the core of each island is Active Aether infused rock (with debris and the like encrusted on it). This Active Aether is decaying. In primitive times, you can go to the edge of the island (maybe under the edge) and knock off rock attached to ropes or nets and weights. Sometimes the rock you knock off will have more Active Aether than dead weight, otherwise the opposite. High quality "lift rock" (with a higher than average Active Aether density) can then be used as the core of your ships. As the Gaia field is described as a flow, and gravity still seems to exist, and there is air resistance, you can tack. A thin sheet of high quality lift rock (even pulverized and bagged, or turned into cement to get the ideal shape) may be pushed harder by the Gaia field when facing "flat" against the flow, and less when turned to show a shallower profile. Throw in sails to resist air, propellers to turn physical effort into push, gravity pulling down, and careful control of such flaps, and you should be able to build an air-ship. But you want to know how primitive we can get. In more primitive times, lift-rocks will be found (some will "roll off" the bottom of the world), and with rope, nets and effort could be used to build bridges between floating islands. Before that, take a small lift rock and some fans. Tie yourself to the lift rock so you are neutral boyency. Add large foot and arm fans and bring lots of food. Fly yourself to another island. In short, there is a mechanism that keeps the island afloat. Humans would exploit that mechanism to keep themselves afloat, and add propulsion mechanisms to move around. With the islands floating around, these tactics would be used when islands get close. You'd invade another island or colonize it when you are close by, and hop from island to island over generations. The culture who masters these techniques spreads the furthest. 

great chance of success since your country is surrounded by mountain, and the enemy have land-ship to move around, it quite safe to say the invasion route will be pretty much fixed. that mean the enemy will have to walk pass your traps if they want to advance. easy to carry well, much easier than carry a big cannon. that allow you to plant them in unexpected place, like a bridge inside enemy's territory, a supply storage, etc.. also, since you dont need many people to plant a mine, you could send many team to simply littering the country with land mines. hard to avoid without any metal detector, the only way to find mine is either: a. dig up every road ahead and b. send a guy to "check". if they choose a. , you can always re-mine a clear route and they will have to dig it up again. if they choose b. , mix anti-personnel mine with anti-landship one and let them figure out themselve. multipurpose when not busy blowing up people and things, mine can be used for many other purposes. they can be used to creat landslide or avalanche, to make boulder to block a road etc. and the most important.. losing a few mines dont have any significant setback for you, while losing your single superweapon is an instant gameover. heck, if your can place your plant behind the 2nd line of defense, then you can keep going even after your barony has been overruned. 

Personally I wouldn't send a large natural number until after I communicated algorithms. Then I'd describe an algorithm that generates a large natural number, and communicate that. Equations are good, because you can describe how to get the number using math, then repeat the number using a different notation, and do this a few times. Possibly getting the notion of "equals" is key. Try to communicate using as many strange ways as you can come up with. Issue "rosetta stones" of messages -- many messages that "all mean the same thing". Draw images using various simple formats. Build the foundations of mathematics more than one way. Try to describe things both the reader and writer might have in common, like the emission lines of hydrogen.
