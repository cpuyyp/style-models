If the word "misogyny" does mean something like that, then I think that the answer is "no": i.e. it doesn't seem to me plausible to attribute "hatred" to the Buddha. WIthin Buddhism, hatred (which is also translated as "aversion") is (together with greed and delusion) called a root of evil -- and the opposites of hatred i.e. adveṣa (non-aggression, lack of hatred), and mettā (loving-kindness) are seen as "wholesome". 

So yes, it's our preferences (or "desires") which cause suffering. "Our preferences" can be called "desire": but also desire's opposite, i.e. "aversion"; and, "ignorance", which together are known as the "three poisons". 

Second, IMO the doctrine isn't that "anything" or that "everything" is impermanent: it's more specific, for example it says that "feelings" are impermanent, or that sankharas are impermanent. 

Wikipedia gave a different set of pairs as Opposite wholesome qualities, which seem more obviously connected/related/opposite than the pairs or "transformations" listed above: 

I guess one way in which the Buddha might be like God is that the Buddha advises humans on what laws to follow? I don't know how else it's interpreted (I expect there are other interpretations). 

I fear that your concentrating on asking, "How can they realize their mistakes?" is similar to insisting that they made a blind mistake which hurt you. You might find it easier if you: 

So, sweets and bread, a month or two ago I stopped eating them altogether: which is better for me. If I don't think of those foods (sugar and wheat) as "mine" any more if see them, then I don't start to eat them and then it's not difficult to stop (because I already successfully stopped a few months ago). Like looking at meat, I don't find it attractive: the thought doesn't occur, "suppose I were to put that in my mouth and taste that ...", I lack any intention so there's never contact. It's also easier to break contact if it's not around. If I stop buying meat, buying cigarettes, buying alcohol, buying bread, having biscuits in the cupboard and soft-drinks in the fridge, then it becomes easier not have them and to then be unable to stop having them. For what it's worth when I quit eating meat (a long time ago) I found I'd still get hungry, so I learned to eat other things instead. If your intention when you eat is satiety and nutrition (which I think is canonical: wanting to remove the feeling of hunger but without causing a subsequent feeling such as feeling over-full) it's better to choose things other than sugar: e.g. vegetables, fibre, protein, fat, water, and traces of minerals and vitamins. 

The end of the Pañcakanga Sutta (which Thiago's answer quoted) appears to fit what the question is asking about (i.e., "happiness and contentment referring to the original teachings of the Buddha"): 

Here are some quotes from commentaries on the monastic rules. The Bhikkhus' Rules -- A Guide for Laypeople 

Reading the first quote in the OP, it seems to me that Ajita Kesakambalin is teaching that there's no continuation into the hereafter ... no after-life, no heaven (and therefore no reason for generosity, if e.g. the reason for generosity is to earn as reward an after-life in heaven). It's difficult for me to see/understand how a belief in "annihilation" (at death) could cause him to also say there is no "this life" (as well as "there is no next life"). Perhaps it's an (imperfect) attempt to teach the great king about emptiness, and about not attaching to results. Conversely the Buddhist Dhamma is meant to be akaliko e.g. pertaining to the here-and-now ... intentions and actions are consequential in this life. 

I expect there are Dhamma-talks on this subject, but it's another way to distinguish true and false Dhamma; this is summarized again here: 

The purpose of the (ordained) Sangha is to be a highly dedicated and qualified community to take the Buddha's message to society: 

According to the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta the reason why the Buddha was reluctant to talk about it was that having various (one or more) views about the self did not result in the cessation of dukkha: 

Regarding your 'will to be a buddha', I think that the last part of the Kalama Sutta says that you are more able to practice the immeasurables (i.e. compassion etc.) after you are 'free': 

According to this Google search the first appearances of this text on the internet is in 2001. And (among those earliest references) this says, 

I think "death" is often described/translation as "dissolution of the aggregates". So I suppose it's the skandhas which "die" or come to an end, are impermanent. This reference includes, 

I think it's the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta, which says e.g. that form is impermanent, therefore unsatisfactory (or painful) rather than pleasant, and therefore not fit to be regarded as "this is myself". 

I don't want to say that yours is a bad suggestion, I only don't see how to apply it. Maybe your suggestion is especially appropriate when you are alone and not with other people, to "help us to remember to have self-compassion" as you said. But maybe it's more beneficial to not hold a view-of-self. 

In theory maybe your mum feels some aversion or pain, associated with her sister; rejects the sister to reject the pain; and, further, rejects anyone (even you) who she associates with her sister; but I suppose that's all beside the point. Two things I learned: 

Perhaps not? I'm thinking that doesn't sound like the "Middle Way" applied to food, and instead sounds more like a Jain practice. If it helps you might find that a compromise is possible, e.g. to eat meat sometimes; or milk product, fish, or eggs, etc.; or, depending on where you live, perhaps a product like quorn. 

I still see SN 56.11 as the 'single' sutta: i.e. if you ask me to pick only single sutta, it would be that one. Consider your problem for example, 

Buddhist theory recommends attitudes called Four Brahmavihāras. These include Compassion and so on, which (to answer your question) is not the same as "not giving a damn". One of the brahmavihāras is Equanimity. Note that "Indifference" is described as a near enemy of equanimity which means that indifference might seem similar to, but is actually an opposite of, equanimity). 

My personal opinion is that it's a pointless (meaningless and unhelpful) analogy. A similar tendency exists elsewhere, e.g. Quantum mysticism suggests a link between quantum theory and consciousness ... whereas this guy suggests we equate his cosmological/mathematical theory with Nirvana (or with certain characteristics/descriptions of Nirvana taken out of context). It may or may not (depending on your preconceptions) be a helpful description/analogy of 11 dimensions ... I guess it's an idiosyncratic description of his ... and I'd guess it's not a good description (not a canonical description) of the Buddhist Nirvana. 

So far as I know, a primary Protestant belief is that people are saved by God (maybe by their love of God and/or by God's love): a Christian's duty (to God) is faith and obediance, which God rewards with salvation (perhaps miraculous salvation). I think it's also (especially in contrast with pre-Reformation Catholicism) something to do with a personal relationship, unmediated by clergy (and perhaps by ritual), between each person and God. I guess that influences this sentence: 

Returning to the Pali suttas, something like the Vipallasa Sutta: Distortions of the Mind (AN 4.49) warns what the misunderstanding (or ignorance) might be about: that fundamentally it might happen at three levels (perception, thought, and view), and on three four characteristics (impermanence, dukkha, and anatta, and subha). 

Perhaps your apparent astonishment is a matter of what you've been accustomed to. Dhammadattu's photographs remind me of a boarding school, army barrack, boy scout camp, youth hostel, and/or camping ground. The dormitory he showed looks to me more "luxurious" than camping (sleeping) in a tent is, which lots of people do (or did) just for a holiday; and a flush toilet is preferable to a "pit latrine". If you're not used to it (from your past experiences) perhaps that's why it's surprising to you? Maybe an analogy is sitting in the "lotus" position: that it's not a problem for people who are used to it. I don't think I can reach the "lotus" position, but sleep on a wood (or straw) surface is feasible. As for "why would they make people sleep like that", apart from any Dharma-related (or health-related) reasons I expect it's practical: cheap, sufficient, no bed-bugs or mice, no linen to launder. On this page, as Dhammadattu said, someone commented that they brought their own bedding, including a foamy mattress which they bought at a local market. 

He hasn't translated/explained the Mata Sutta (SN15.14-19) -- I don't know why he hasn't, and (who knows?) maybe he will later, but maybe that implies he finds them less important than other suttas whose translations he finished earlier. 

Calling it "torture" and a "concentration camp" is obviously an exaggeration; and I read the Buddha's "not believing in asceticism" as meaning that people need enough food. There might be something to say about the eighth precept (but I don't know what): 

Anxiety is also one of the translations of dukkha, so the nature of anxiety (and its cessation) might be fundamental. 

There's something translated as "contact", if and when all three touch (e.g. if an "ear" and a "sound" contact each other, together with "auditory consciousness"). I suppose you can theorize that any of these three might (or might not) exist independently of such contact: e.g. maybe a sound-object exists even where there isn't an ear, or an ear without a sound, or ear-and-sound without consciousness, or consciousness without ear-and/or-sound, etc. Anyway there's "contact" when all three coincide. Contact is something with arises-and-dissolves. I say "six senses" because I think that "idea and mind" are viewed as a sixth "sense": i.e. the mind perceives an idea (or series of ideas), in a similar way to the eye perceiving a sight (or series of sights). So, given those definitions ... is such consciousness (i.e. sense-consciousness) "me", is it worth viewing it as self or as a non-material "soul"? Would you say for example, "there's a sight, and there's an eye seeing it, there's contact/consciousness of seeing it, the object being seen has the form and name of (i.e. it is, and it is called) "a tree" for example, or "a car", or whatever the external object is? Is such consciousness "eternal", in your opinion? And would viewing consciousness as "self" lead to liberation and/or realization? Buddhism argues that views of self (i.e. seeing anything as "me") leads to a "thicket of views" and other problems -- for example, quoting from the Alagaddupama Sutta 

That third sounds like it might be Buddhist, if it means, "people without attachments can do more" (e.g. if they don't have family obligations to hold them back) ... but then again consider the Vinaya rules, which dictate limits on what people are able (allowed) to do. Buddhism isn't entirely about becoming powerful ("future freedom of action") ... it's more to do with "self-control" and freedom (liberation) from suffering. The descriptions of "Entropica" show I think that it's not intended as a description of mainstream Buddhism: 

The same is true of Hindu texts, i.e. the earliest records of writing dates from a couple of hundred years after the Buddha, 

See pages 51 through 52 of this document which details whether an object qualifies as "not given". Lying is pretty objective, but also has its issues in getting proper communication across. You might like to read or browse the The Patimokkha Rules (linked/referenced above) ... they're quite detailed, legalistic. The Chapter about "lying" starts on page 245, saying, 

Poetry, maybe? Or perhaps suttas, meditation; waiting for emotions to sooth themselves. The whole eight-fold way possibly. 

Perhaps that's what this poem is doing: simply awareness of a stream of thoughts? What's the difference between that and, I don't know, any other ordinary unenlightened mode of thought or life? 

I think there's a limit to what you can "prove" using logic (in particular it's difficult to prove the premises you're using) -- on the other hand logic can be helpful. In summary, when you're studying at a school like this one3 perhaps it might help (to understand what's being taught) if you were to see statements about rebirth as being axiomatic rather than proven, and see whether you derive useful results from those axioms. 

From that I take it that it's a sympathetic joy: if you "feel" compassionate when someone else is sad, sympathetic joy is what you feel when, because, taking your cue from someone else being happy. Another explanation is that the purpose of the practice is to make you devoid of hostility: devoid of jealousy, for example (e.g. "I'm happy for his success" rather than "I'm envious of his success"). Dhammadhatu's answer might be right as well. For example, some people might feel glad because of good or skillful actions. If you feel their gladness then you too are made glad as a result of good or skillful actions. 

There's The Hwa Gye Sa International Zen Center. I know nothing of it but its web site (i.e. that it's "international", Zen, next to Seoul, and has retreats with an application form and an email address); and that in 2007 Hyon Gak Sunim was teaching there. It also a page with three or four links to other places (one of which is Mu Sang Sa). 

Or, because you're interested in a book which explains a "way of life", I recommend, The Buddha's Teachings on Prosperity: At Home, At Work, in the World (which also introduces the suttas, but categorizes them and picks the ones which are especially intended for people in lay society). There is also a list of "Useful resources" online, recommended by various users of this site. Secondly, I recently picked up a book called "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle and I am getting confused. What does it mean to be truly present? I do not recommend Eckhart Tolle's book as Buddhist, nor as a lucid introduction to Buddhism.
