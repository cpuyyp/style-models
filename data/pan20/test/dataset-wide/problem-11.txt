Well then it depend on how much precise the mental image need to be, but you can play with it. By keeping the looking of the interior of your castle very secret, you can forbid teleportation inside. By changing the looking of the place where your castle is located, you can therefore possibly prevent teleportation there (perhaps repainting the walls is sufficient, I do not know). But a sure thing is that information will be important. If for example a dragon need to have seen the place to picture a sufficiently good mental image of a place, then dragon will be strictly forbidden to travel in foreign countries, since simply allowing them to pass by your fortress result in great danger for it. Note on dragonfolks' fortresses If you do have dragons at your disposal, you are not force to use the usual "tall tower on high ground" kind of fortress, since they are built that way partly in order to watch its surroundings. You have dragons, you can just use flying sentry, thus possibly making underground fortress a viable solution. 

Note that industry revolution only emerged in Europe, thousands of years after being populated. Moreover, most of the world, at the time of industrial revolution, showed no sign of transforming toward industrial revolution. This indicate that industrial revolution is not inherent to any human society. In fact a lot of human societies seem stable on the long run (e.g. tribal societies) and are likely not to tend to industrial revolution (nor to any other major changes). With this in mind, it is more relevant to look at what is necessary for a industrial revolution to happen. Here is a non exhaustive list. 

In the second scenario, and on the long run, since only a part of the population is affected, zombies may be dehumanized and exterminations may be envisaged. But there would be opposition from the relatives to these zombies. 

If the liquid have a mass, it is attracted by other massive objects such as star. In order to still fill the whole universe, and not just be aggregated around stars (or at a larger scale around galaxies), it needs to be incompressible. At the same time your liquid must dilate as the same rate as the universe to always fill it (but I will not address this problem in my answer). Planets moving through the liquid will push on it. Therefore, a planet is slow down by the liquid except if both travel at the same speed. That implies currents in the liquid. That kind of system could be stable only if there is no friction, otherwise the currents will slow down, and thus the planets. It would leads to the planets simply falling into their stars (and stars falling on the centre of their galaxies). So, your liquid needs to be frictionless. 

Nowadays, from a biological point of view, the concept of a human being is quite well defined. A species is defined as all beings capable of having fertile descendants. But in medieval times, that was way more complicated, since there was no definition for a species. For example, during the conquest of the American continent by European, the question arise to know whether or not indigenous people were human. Given a medieval world where the concept of humanity is not clearly defined by science, could other sentient species (elves, dwarves, goblins, etc.) be considered "human" (and could they consider humans to be "elves", "dwarves", "goblins") ? In other words : could an inclusive concept of humanity exists, where massive biological differences are considered on the same level as other differences we know between different ethnic groups of humans (e.g. cultural differences) ? There is of course two cases to consider : 

Therefore, in case of war, you have to defend your merchant fleet to secure your supplying of vital goods. Long-range defences or defences using aircraft will not be more viable than the use of warships, since most of the oceans are far away from any coast. In fact, in your scenario, which includes lots of stealthy stuff, warships may even be more important than today to protect transport ships. Since you can not foresee an attack, your ships must be protected at any time. Of course it may lead to the militarisation of freighters to make them able to defend themselves, but it means transforming civilian ships into warships, it does not discard them. 

I want to stress an important point about your question. It is actually possible to implant false memory, and it is fairly easy. Of course it is not as easy as just handshaking, but still... Research have been made and the result are creepy. I advise you this wikipedia article, particularly the part "Legal case". Basically the idea is that a man was accused of multiple sexual assaults. At first he was denying the whole, arguing he did not recall anything. After a while, he started to remember. A psychologist make the following experiment : he invented a case of sexual assault by the man, and ask him about it. After a while the man could "remember" it very precisely. (note that it does not make him innocent, it just proves that you can not trust a confession) I also advise the lecture of this other article about the misinformation effect. The big difference with your scenario are : 

That is for the minimal preparation. Now how will your DD be shaped ? First of all a question, you went everybody to (be able to) vote, that is the legislative power. But who will hold the executive power, and thus the power to propose law. First of all you need to choose interesting proposals. Once it is done, I propose to allow application for a "writing committee" who's task will be to actually write a law based on the proposition. The people who made the proposition can choose whoever they want for the committee, which will be of course given juridical support. But how to choose the "interesting proposals" ? In the spirit of a DD, here are some possibilities : Reddit like Proposition gain points when they are voted up, loses point with time, and if they are near the top for a certain time, they are chosen. As for Reddit, everybody can submit, everybody can vote, and the all stuff can be divided by topics to allow you to focus on your interests. The makers of proposal should be anonymous until the funding of the writing committee, to avoid external pressures or corruption. Random Everybody have a little place where to put a proposal. Each day some of them are picked at random and then the writing committee funded. It allows ugly looking proposals to be funded. 

Two features that you could consider as setting apart science and magic are (inspired from what I know of consideration about magic during the middle age and renaissance) : 

You can see that the list is surely not complete, simply because it does not make clear why China or the Ottoman Empire, for example, did not enter the industrial revolution before Europe. 

The most believable are probably the nearest of what human actually use, and can do. One possibility is to communicate by sound, but instead of using phonemes, use musical notes. Even humans can make the distinction between different pitches (and some can even recognise them on an absolute scale). So you can simply replace words and sentences by melodies. One question remains, "why not both phonemes and musical notes ?". Well, for the same reason humans use musical notes in a very restrictive way when they speak. Note that it is hard to imagine a believable way to communicate other than with sounds, since it has many advantages : not directional, variations are easily to produce and you can encode a lot of information in short period. I think that the fact sound is not directional is the biggest evolutionary advantage, since it means you can inform all your buddy at the same time that there is a danger. 

Select a random sample of the population of 0.1 % of the total. During several days, force them (as a civil duty) to adress and solve a set of problems (by political means). Since they have a reliable way to vote and (I assume) discuss online, there is no practical problems. During the last day, make them select a set of problems to solve for the following random sample. Go back to 1. 

The evolution of the different sentient beings was not independent. It can be that there is a common ancestor or that the first sentient capable of inter galactic travel created all the others based on itself or wiped out all species which were different from it. The evolution as we picture it is not correct. It can be, once again, that the first sentient creature created all others, or something deeper about evolution or the universe. For example if the universe is a computer simulation due to people lacking imagination, or things like that. 

The thing to begin with is that if you want an AI to have a feature, this feature must be, somehow, implemented. For example, your AI has the feature to be seeking for self improvement, otherwise it would note try to self improve. (note that it can be tricky, if you ask for the production of the most paper-clip, and do not forbid self improvement, your AI may use it to get a better result) It is not clear, that self improvement will imply that the AI will implemented into itself (or into its future versions) the concepts of entities and self-awareness. Therefore, and Cort Ammon already noted this, it is not clear that the AI will be self aware at all. To go further, it is probably necessary to actually consider the task given to the AI. If it is "become the most intelligent AI", then a strong concept of entity is needed as well as self awareness : since it must modify itself, it must define what is itself, and what is not. In this scenario, it will answer as a "I" (but will at same time perhaps not consider all of subroutines it use as part of itself, particularly if it is some proprietary code it is not allowed to modify). If the task was "construct a AI such as it is optimized to do the same task you were given" (magnificent recursive definition which perfectly make sense for an AI), then the concept of entity could be avoided. That is not certain, since the best way to construct the wanted AI could be to switch to a self improvement strategy. So it really depend on the task and on strategies allowed to fulfil it. However, it is possible to say a bit more on how will the AI refer to itself. Most probably, since you want human to be able to interact with it, a coder will somewhere give the instruction "try not to be creepy" or "make the interaction by human with you easy". To do that, the AI will probably refer to itself as an "I", whatever is it considers to be. To go still a little further, you can draw a parallel with human. We are social and for our social interactions to work we must refer as ourself as individuals (at least in modern society). But, it is not obvious that all of our internal (unconscious for us) subroutines consider ourself as one entity. The part of the brain dedicated to managing organs may "consider" the muscles and heart to be different entities. "Muscle 54B-2 asks for more energy, send a request to Heart to pump more blood, and start the subroutine 64A-r.3 to ask Blood Vessels in the region to dilate. Muscle 54B-2, please send a feedback in 12 ticks to let us calibrate our action." So to have a true complete answer, it is needed to define what does "consider" mean for an AI ? When I write 

The answer is : not much due to the experiment. The experiment is about making particles reach very high energy, and then smash it together. The highest energy reached in CERN, according to wikipedia is $13 \cdot 10^{12}$ eV (eV stands for electron-volt). However, cosmic ray (energetic particle coming from the space) hit the earth constantly. Here is a little graph from wikiepedia which explain how much, relative to the energy of the particle : 

Merit is dependent on each activity. To merit political power, you must be gifted in the domain of political business, to merit high level military responsibilities you must be a good strategist, to merit great acknowledgement in science you must be a great researcher. Basically, being a muggle only prevent you to earn great merit in the domain of magic. Well, you could argue that magic could massively alter your capacities in any domain. But then you have to make the best duo "great wizard expands capacities of great X" (where X can be any kind of profession). Therefore, it would make perfect sense to judge the capacities of each person without magic to select them, and to select the best "enhancer" with a separate test. And you are just back were we started, with simply a new subclass of wizardry : "enhancement". To have a problem building a meritocracy, you would have to add new rules on your magic system as "spells can only be cast on the caster/on a wizard". 

Disclaimer : I will address a rather sensible subject in that answer (disability), since I am not a native English speaker the subject may be treated in terms seemingly disrespectful (Google translate is unhelpful in that domain). It is obviously not my intention, so if it appears to be the case, please consider suggesting an edit. First of all, zombies will not be labelled as zombies at first. It looks like a mere detail, but as long as you consider them as people, sick and highly contagious people, but still people, no strategy looking like "kill them all" will be adopted. Because we do not fight against disease by killing the infected (as far as I know humans have never done it). Anyway, lots of them may die in the first weeks (as pointed out by AndreiROM) due to the lack of survival instinct and stupidity, but lots of them will also take cared of by their family or friends and be brought to the hospital (they just look strangely sick). Of course, investments will be made to search for a cure, because there will be no reason to thing that a cure may not actually exist. The amount of investment will heavily depend on the affected countries. On a longer term, it is probable that zombies will be treated as we actually treat heavily disabled people, or people suffering from dementia. Somebody needs to take care of them constantly, for example to help them feed themselves or to avoid them harming themselves. It can be done by the family, but due to the contagious aspect of the disease, it is likely that specialized institutions will be used the most. The point is that human beings not having, losing, or being unable to fulfil independently they survival instinct is not new. We already have institutions, help centers and even sometimes traditions to help deal with it. The real problem here is the scale. It is about 15% of the population, meanings two things :
