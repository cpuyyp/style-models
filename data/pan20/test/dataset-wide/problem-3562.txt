Yes, it is a question that can be complicated. On one side, if you are practising for a running event, you should probably focus on the running first and do some complementary weight lifting. On the other side, if you practise for general well being and have a limited time available for training, you could start with the weights and skip the running. My own experiments with measuring training effect with pulse meters shows me that you get a good cardio effect when you lift weights, especially when you do exercises that involve large muscle groups (deadlift, squats, etc). 

In general, the people who live the longest, sleep six to seven hours per night see Wikipedia: Sleep. So how does sleep and exercise relate to each other? 

Speculating on performance in sports based on physical attributes is always difficult, there are always exceptions to whatever rule you find. My answer to your questions is split into two parts: 1) check that your weight in the the normal range for a non-athlete, this is important given your history. 2) compare your height/weight with other successful female swimmers to get an idea about their height & weight. Based on part 2) it seems like your competitive advantage in swimming would increase if you gained weight. Weight Your BMI, body mass index, seems to be in the normal range for women. Yours is around 19 (52.6 kg / 1.65m^2 = 19.3) which is ok. I know that there is a debate on BMI, especially for athletes but it should be there as a check. So it seems like you are on the right path from recovery from an eating disorder, which is great. I have close relatives that went through that hell when they were at your age. Great that you have support from your family and coach from that perspective. Weight and swimming One idea is to check the height, weight and BMI for the best female swimmers and - for example - compare your data with theirs. E.g. winners in the recent Olympics in 400 m, 200m individual medley $URL$ , (Medley since I don't know your swim style). A subset of the sample of 20 swimmers between 1996 and 2012, are {name, height in meters, weight in kg}: 

Besides the answers above, I can also recommend balance exercises where your feet leaves the ground. For example: 

Learn to swim without a wetsuit first. It is a non trivial task since swimming is a technically demanding sport (contrary to what I thought initially). The big upside is with a good technique in a triathlon context, you will spend much less energy on the swim part and be in better shape for the biking and running. Get a technical trainer for the swimming. Not a coach that only tells you to swim "10x100m" etc. If you are new, there are a lot of small details that are important in the long run. Get a friend to practice with. You can then work on both the distances, e.g. the "10X100 etc" and the technique together. Swimming outdoors is different from indoors (waves, sounds, objects in water, temperature, lack of sight etc). But with a good technique and lots of practice, it is less stressful. Wetsuits can be difficult to put on and swim with initially. Try it out before - preferable in the water - you buy it. Some shops will let you do this, for example, at swim camps. 

Warm ups are important for all sports, both physical and also a mental warm up. Here are some warm ups for swimming: 

For a week of my vacation, I will be staying at a hotel that has a short pool (17m). My question is: Given a set of swim drills (e.g. some swim drills), for a short pool what should a workout program look like that focuses on technique? Workouts should be around 45 min. I am a beginner at swimming, typically I swim 50m at around 50s with around 30-31 strokes and can keep that pace for some time. My goal for swimming this "trainingperiod" is to participate in an open water race in the center of Stockholm that is about 1.6 km long, see Riddarfjardssimmningen or FB. Besides on the vacation, I have practiced swimming 3-4 times per week. 

The question is relevant since it is easy to be "off" in terms of effort, both to practice too easy and practicing too hard. I have not found any research on this but I think it is quite clear from observing how many never reach their goals and - on the other side - how many that overtrain and become injured. A system that tries to make your next workout in the right effort range is Firstbeat Athlete. It terms of your framework, it captures data from a "R-R" pulsmeter or through a manual entry of heart rate. Then, based on your age, sex, training history and a model for gradually increasing effort, it recommends the effort for a number of work outs. As an example, assuming that you have an exercise profile as you described in your answer (2 hard, 3 easy) then the system would recommend the next exercises as you can see in the diagram below. 

Here is a video with some mobility exercises from the Swedish MAQ "school" (Muscle Action Quality), see Demo of exercise. It is a great combination of exercises for mobility, no weights, only a stick. Basically the combo consists of "dead lift" with straight legs, a front squat and a squat with straight arms. All done in a slow and controlled manner. Most gym have light wooden sticks that you can use for this. I have done this as a warm up exercise for a couple of years and my mobility has increased dramatically compared to when I started. Given that you are quite immobile, I wouldn't start with any weights at all. Instead focus on this kind of drills that are similar to core, posterior chain focused weight lifting. 

How do you compare swimming and running speeds? For example, is swimming 100m in 60s comparable to running 1 km in four minutes in terms of effort or in terms the times in races (e.g. map percentiles of finish times). 

In general, the best indicator that you can return to practice is that you feel more positive about it. However, since you have been "addicted", you should be suspicious of your feelings and have some measurable "toll gate" indicators, e.g. social life, less fatigue and less sleep problems, before you go back to the gym. Also, I would get a system in place that stops you from training too hard, e.g. register training in Firstbeat software and follow its recommendation on training effect for workouts. This could limit you from doing too much high intensity training. Until you have the green light from the toll gate indicators in place and a measurement system in place, I would do something different, e.g a team sport. 

As a complement to the other answers, I can recommend the exercises in Brungardt - Leg workout. Besides a wide array of exercises with/without weights, it contains 12 week programs that has a lot of variation in exercises, difficulty level and time spent. 

There is also a chapter in the book The 4 hour body about how to sprint faster that I found interesting. For example, using a walks (walking a fixed distance a little bit faster every day), deadlift (1-2 lifts of a weight close to 1RM once a week) and running starts to develop speed. However, I have not tried it myself but the author is open with the references so it should be possible to check their validity. 

Given the risk of getting caught in the race & shutting down pain signals from your body -> worse injuries, I would skip the race. For example, see this article. Even if it is a bit old (1992), it states that running as an exercise has a high frequency of injuries and one of the main causes is competition. Naturally, you can be injured in all sports and even without doing sports. My own experience from competitive sports is once you are in the race/game etc., it is too easy to ignore normal signals regarding injuries and just focus on winning/completion. 

For me, working with a "swiss ball" (for example, see Exercise ball) and doing yoga has made me more aware of what happens in the core when I lose posture. I think that the awareness is more important to practice than strength since your core strength is probably good enough. When working at a screen, I try at all times to keep the posture good and move at least every 30-40 minutes, use a timer or similar. 

My question is: Based on experience and research, is the 4 week time window too short? The argument for a longer period would be that you capture longer trends, the argument against is that it if it is too long, the motivation for seeing changes decreases. Also, too long of a window might not capture the actual impact of training. My overall health goal at this time of the year is not connected to a specific event. 

Given your priorities (avoiding injuries as no 1) and your current work out plan, I would go for the yoga routine. Done in the right way, it will give additional awarness of your body that will help in everyday situations. The other options you gave seem to be more of cardio. To get more variation in your work outs, you could consider to do weigth lifting instead of TRX at least once a week. Variation is good for long term motivation and also reduces the chance for injuries. 

One variation of cardio traning - to the fixed or variable sets of distance and time- is "fartlek" (speed play), see Wiki entry on Fartlek. Basically, it is a mix of low and high speed training. The training form was developed in the 1930s in Sweden. In the Wikipedia entry, there is an example of a typical training session, its historical background and an example of where it has been used in the US. Here is an example of a futuristic "speed play" training session, Fartlek w "google glasses" "Speed play" can be appropriate for you when your goal is to lose weight since part of the concept is to run at full speed for part of the session. This will help you to get closer to high intensity training which seems to be better for losing weight than prolonged low intensity training. Personally, I did this training in school in Sweden, in the military service and part of the physical training when playing basketball. Now, when I am older and have more problems with my knees - which stops me from running any longer distances - I like the "speed play" concept since it makes me more conscious of how I feel and not focused on the distance or time.
