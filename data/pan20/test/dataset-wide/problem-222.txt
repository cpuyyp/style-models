The easiest route would be to have lycanthropy function as a normal disease. The following would cause 10% of the population, upon reaching late teens, to become werewolves: The disease has a high rate of transference; it is airborn, and even those immune to the disease will be carriers. The disease is widespread, and can live in many hosts. The result is that effectively 100% of the population would be in contact with the disease from birth, and thus contract the disease as children. The disease would be almost impossible to avoid; modern medicine may be able to stop it, but in Medieval times, it would be absolutely impossible. The first symptoms of the disease would seem like a normal baby illness: low fever, general fussiness, but no other obvious effects. In some children, it may not even be noticed. In the course of the illness, 90% of the population develop antigens, which clear out the infection and provide permanent immunity. Those that fight off the disease and become immune will not become werewolves; those that do not become immune after first contracting the disease will remain infected their entire life. The disease will remain dormant in the 10% of the population that does not develop an immunity, until their body stops producing growth hormones. Apart from those with rare genetic disorders, most people produce growth hormones until their late teens or early twenties. When those without immunity stop production of growth hormones, they will be hit with the second stage of the disease: the disease rapidly modifies DNA, which causes all the effects of a werewolf. The result is that 10% of the population at any given time will be werewolves. No one knows who will be a werewolf until the first time they change; for the vast majority of werewolves, this will be in the late teens or early twenties. Being a werewolf doesn't preclude your children to be werewolves, not does having immunity protect your children from becoming werewolves. 

For immortality through cell regeneration, lasting for enough time, mutations would have to either be stopped before they start, or be removed, replaced, or repaired. Stopping mutations If the immortality process stops mutations, then whoever took it would immediately stop aging, apart from normal wear-and-tear. Illness, heart disease, and even cancer would still be deadly; even if your heart is fine on a cellular level, if your arteries get stopped up with plaque, you'll still have a heart attack. Still, the process would be safe; it could be administered to anyone at any age. Children, even unborn babies, would be able to grow up normally, even with the immortality treatment in place. The elderly wouldn't benefit from the drug nearly as much, because they already have cellular mutations; there would be no way to "turn back time". A discovery like that would take decades, if not centuries, to create and test. Keeping something like that a secret would be nearly impossible; as it progressed, I'm sure many companies would begin testing their own 'immortality treatment'. It would most likely be released slowly and updated over time, gradually extending life rather than a sudden switch where no one dies. One decade, most people live until they are 80; the next, 85, and the next, 100. The change would be slow enough that the implications of longer lifespans would have time to sink in to civilization at large - and anyone opposed to it would have to fight gradual change, which is a very difficult process. One or two generations in, and most resistance would be gone. Population would change, but since it would be a gradual change of tens or hundreds of years, the impact wouldn't be very severe; the end result would be a high population of healthy, useful adults, which would boost productivity, science, and technology. Fears about the drug may crop up, but overall people would most likely trust it. Remove, Repair, Replace On the other hand, if the treatment repaired existing mutations, such as by using some sort of template to remove "bad DNA", the elderly would benefit tremendously. As their cells naturally were replaced, the new cells would be free of mutations; their wrinkles would vanish, their hair would regain its color, and their muscles would begin to regrow. Limbs wouldn't grow back, but diseases like cancer would be eradicated. Unlike the other drug, this would be a "miracle cure". In months or even days, the elderly would be returned to their prime of life; everyone would look like they were in their late 20s, where their cells had the lowest number of mutations in their adult life. However, the process would be incredibly dangerous to children, especially before birth. The processes the human body uses to grow limbs and organs in a child is much different than the normal maintenance cycle of an adult human. The treatment would most likely destroy a zygote before it ever had a chance to mature, meaning that mothers would have to stop the treatment to have any chance of giving birth naturally. If the process were a one-time event, rather than an ongoing course, it may permanently stop natural birth. Because this process would be a sudden, immediate change, and would result in fast, obvious results (cells could be observed reproducing error-free within minutes in a lab), it is possible that this process could be developed in secret - indeed, it could be an accidental discovery. Testing, of course, would be found to cause sterility in women, which would require more testing. If information got out, there would immediately be two sides: those that want immediate immortality and demand the immediate release of the drug, and those that want to save the children and call for its eradication. The result would be who won in the end: either be a select few "immortals", who purchase the drug on the black market and hide their age, or a planet populated entirely by immortal adults, with no chance to even have children. 

Other Considerations All this assumes the portals only transmit matter and certain forms of energy; if magnetic fields or gravity are also transmitted, even worse outcomes are available. Does pointing a portal at the ground negate gravity above it? I'm not sure I want to find out... 

Such technology would quickly put any space empire at the absolute top of the food chain. Depending on its limits, of course. Transportation If the field can be transported, a single high-speed transport would be able to move incredible amounts of materials. the size of the transport depends on how big the technology is to open and close (or 'inflate' and 'deflate', if you prefer) the space. If a 'container' can be inflated and deflated from any location, then the ship could be nanotech sized, as all it really needs is to be able to move really fast and be locatable by the right people. But never mind moving stuff and people. How about planets? Find a nice planet, stick an inflated field in its path, and once it goes in, zip it up and take it wherever you want! Make your own solar system! Defense Which leads me to the next point. As Dan Smolinske pointed out, you could create a maze of large and small spaces that would make it very difficult to find your home planet. But why stop there? First, find a very chaotic part of the universe - somewhere with supernovas, black holes, new stars being born, and as much dangerous stuff as you can think of scattered around. Take that solar system you created earlier and set it up somewhere in the middle, still inside its field. Now, not only do you have a needle in a haystack, but your haystack is exploding! All the time! To get in and out safely is a little tricky, which is why I came up with four possible scenarios: 

Apocalypse Now Early one morning, all the binaries in the world vanish. Every piece of compiled code is gone; data is still there, the code files are still intact, but every piece of compiled code is gone. Poof. The first thing on everyone's mind will not be how to get it back, but how to survive; fly-by-wire airplanes will drop out of the sky, phones won't work, the Internet will be gone, cars won't start, power plants would shut down. All those devices and systems, large or small, have little chips that were once full of firmware. Granted, anything built in the 1980s or earlier will probably be fine; cars didn't start getting onboard computers until the 1990s, for the most part. Still, this isn't just an engineering or programming disaster. It's an apocalypse-scale event. A good chunk of world will be without reliable food, water, or electricity; communication will be down completely. Where to start? The best place would be a college or university, since they would be most likely to have a working punch card reader (and a generator). Using punch cards as the initial interface, our intrepid programmers could start writing code immediately. Of course, those old machines are terribly slow, and huge power hogs. So, our programmers use the punch-card-driven systems to program microcontrollers, or their faster cousins, microcomputers. These tiny computers will need some sort of interface; hopefully, there is an old transistor-driven keyboard and a few old CRTs laying around. Modern keyboards and LCD screens rely on firmware. With a little code wrangling, our programmers have a computer, a keyboard, a screen, and a way to save their code. Additionally, any devices with firmware that can be quickly rewritten will be re-flashed; some old hardware, like old CD drives, had very little firmware, but would still be able to read modern discs. Security Fuses Getting back what was lost will be much, much harder. Almost all modern hardware will be nothing but trash; almost all chips with a burned security fuse will be useless, turning cell phones and laptops alike into bricks. Hard drives, though the data still exists, won't have firmware to extract that data. The best bet is open source computers. Someone, somewhere, will have a non-security-locked flash chip with some stored code. From there, the open source computer can be rebuilt, and the programmers can slowly begin to restore software. Otherwise, someone has a back up of all their code on a cheap flash drive; with a bit of hardware hacking, it's possible to extract that data, though it will be a difficult process. Back to the Future Once computers (however tiny) are operational, life will get a little easier, but most modern hardware will be useless. Even if the BIOS on a modern motherboard could be rebuilt, the video, ethernet, even sound cards would be missing their firmware. Software would reset to where it was in the late 1980s. It would return, gradually, but I expect it would take longer than the first time around. What with the apocalypse, and all. 

I can think of three ways a river could shoot high into the air: For my first example, the river begins as a huge lake, high in the mountains, in a natural basin, then flows down through a fissure in the rock, deep underground. It flows underground some distance, then gently bends until pointing directly upwards. With the huge pressure of the lake high above, it jets through a natural nozzle, high into the air. However, there are significant problems with this solution. First, unlike most lakes, a mountain lake does not get much water from runoff, but instead is fed directly by rainfall. The water in the lake would have to be replaced at a rate equal to the rate it is leaving, which means the mountains will have to have substantial rainfall - on the order of monsoon season, all day every day, for even a moderate sized river. Second, the rate of erosion would quickly turn this from a jet pointing upwards to a jet pointing sideways, especially if the water is so highly pressurized that it sprays a mile into the air. Third, the path the water follows would have to be solid rock, capable of withstanding the massive force of the river. In reality, most rock would split, and the river would take multiple paths out, lowering the pressure. This system might be possible if the fissure under the lake opened after the lake was filled and drained the lake drained dry over a period of weeks or even months, but a constantly running stream would be almost impossible. On the up side, this very well might reach a mile into the air, given enough pressure. The other method would actually be similar to a geyser; water flows down from a natural mountain spring, into an underground passage. As the water moves under the city, it crosses a pocket of magma, which heats the water enough to produce substantial amounts of steam. The resulting increase in pressure would cause the water to jet out of the exit at a much higher rate of flow. However, unlike the previous example, this water would not jet a mile into the air; perhaps only a few hundred feet, at best. The steam, of course, would shoot high into the atmosphere, and could give the impression that the jet of water was much higher than reality. Still, as long as the water maintains a constant volumetric flow, and the magma pocket continues to be heated, you could expect the river to shoot into the air for quite some time. Eventually, of course, the cooling magma and the erosive water would redirect the path of the river, but that may take a century or more. Finally, my third method uses a bit of engineering and a bit of stage magic. A high natural stream in the mountains is diverted into a huge man-made pipe; the pipe travels down the mountain, and is buried under the city. At the location where the pipe emerges from the ground, the water is funneled into an enormous glass pipe, which reaches high into the air. The pressure forces the water up the pipe, where it then emerges in a geyser. The geyser is only a dozen feet tall, but the water running down the sides of the glass pipe would obscure the pipe itself, giving the impression that the column of water was self-supported, and much higher (and more stable) that would be physically possible. Of all the methods, this is the most likely to remain stable; as long as the mountain stream keeps flowing, and the pipe doesn't break, this system would last for hundreds of years... though don't expect the townspeople to stay in the dark about the glass pipe for very long. It's a tourist trap, not a real magical river.
