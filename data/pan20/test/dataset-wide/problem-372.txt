Over the generations, this sort of phobia – where the crew is concerned with even being close to a gravity well – would turn into almost a religion. An ark ship travelling for generations could develop its own lore, traditions, and faith... meaning that arriving at the planet would be Armageddon, and the colonists would be the anti-christ(s). The (prophesied?) Captain, in turn, would be a sort of Messiah, or, at the least, the Pope. The colonists, then, must break this unified front into smaller groups. Fanatics are obsessed with purity. It's not enough to know who is opposed to gravity – everyone is – you need to know how tainted people are by gravity. How many people have passed through the parts of the ship that were able simulate gravity? Whose ancestors used those gravity simulators? Whose ancestors boarded the ship last (and were in a gravity well longer than others)? Alternatively, genetic enhancements probably were unevenly expressed – so who shows signs of muscle loss, weak bones, etc? Purity becomes paramount, hereditary even, and potential traitors are everywhere. The colonists can play on these tendencies. First, they should broadcast a series of pleas from families desperate for supplies – begging, please won't you send us the food/medicine/technology we need to live? Make the stories as sob inducing as possible – really ham it up. Next, broadcast a message (ostensibly addressed to the captain) saying: 

500 Years represents about 15 generations (based on a 33 year reproductive cycle - $URL$ which given there inst very harsh environmental conditions or defense worries to contend with, and given that there was a reasonable stockpile to get stated with, there would be reasonably good chance of success. 

Replace a bone in your body with a prosthetic material Here's one potential idea. Replace a bone in your body with a prosthetic material, with a portion or perhaps all of it composed of a predictably decaying radioactive isotope. It very much depends on how close a time you need to record to that will depend on the material, as the half-life of the isotope in question will determine the material. You could have a number of different isotopes also to determine the age from long half lives to shorter. $URL$ This wont solve the problem with needing to send more detailed messages, but it might help establish a reasonably accurate date from which you can be retrieved from? Edit: I had originally also stated that the Mesozoic era atmosphere wouldn't be survivable by humans, but after some further research I found this wasn't the case. (Thanks @SethWhite !) 

Weaponry used in the war Firstly the question is how 'dirty' the weaponry used in the war was, as anything other than clean bombs ($URL$ or something like pure fusion wepaons ($URL$ would result in many years of residual radiation and radioactive particulate. The radioactive particulate in particular can be a problem as it deposits and becomes embedded in the soil, effectively ruling out effective horticulture (Ie. The environment may be relatively safe to traverse but it would be a bad idea to dig up the soil for any reason) Beginnings of Settlement Assuming that the population in the subterranean dwellings also has a stockpile of equipment and resources (machine fuel, generators, etc) then the first step is the acquisition of resources essential to survival. 

An itching sensation in the back of the planetsiders minds will stir, a concern they weren't even aware of before. Families will pack small bags of the essentials, and calmly but quickly move towards the space side. Soon what started as a few people will turn into a zero-g stampeed. Everyone planetside will scramble to get to the space side of the ship. Riots and desperate pleas of at least take my children! abound as The Captain declares martial law. As this is going on, the colonists load the shuttles with their police force, armed with what game-hunting projectile weapons they can muster, and head back to the ship... where the docking bay is planetside. With martial law declared and all the ship's security occupied with holding back the planetside exodus, it takes some time for the crew to realize they've been boarded. Confusion reigns. Blockaded doors. A shootout outside the bridge. And at last, silence settles as a ship-wide announcement from the colonist commander crackles over the speakers: 

Some great answers here – want to briefly add my two cents. The TLDR version is: make contraception the norm (free IUDs for anyone who wants them!), give women full rights over their bodies, and create a more egalitarian society where anyone can have long, successful careers in fields that interest them. It does depend on how you define 'manageable population growth,' but below are some knobs you might be able to turn without getting dystopian. Having children is both expensive and dangerous. In fact, pregnancy has always been a leading cause of death for women, especially in poor countries. Combined with the fact that infant mortality has drastically declined with advances in medicine, having a baby in well off countries has become something people do less often simply because they don't need to have 12 kids just to make sure some survive until adulthood. Moreover, with ubiquitous contraception and control over their bodies, women have more choice in when and how often they have children. In most countries these days, this leads to lower birthrates naturally. And it makes sense: if you could make an expensive, large commitment with a (relatively) high risk of death anytime in your life, would it be the first thing did? Or would you get some lower risk, lower commitment things out of the way first? Given the profound nature of bringing life into the world, and having another being completely dependent on you, wouldn't you want to take the time to make sure you're ready and able to do it right? Would you want to take this risk often, or only once or twice? As of 2015, the US birthrate has dropped to the lowest levels in decades, well below 'replacement.' With more access to the things that make that possible, I don't see any reason the downward trend wouldn't continue. Having babies is hard, but in the past, NOT having babies was even harder. Make it easy to not have babies and you're probably most of the way there (again, subject to your definition of 'manageable population growth'). 

Workshops and Fabrication - Initially a number of high volume workshops will be needed to fabricate everything from tools, to pipes, to struts, moving part mechanism etc. This will allow for work on the other projects to advance Water - Water will need to be distributed first from a central point (eg. well(s)), however as the water needs of the populace rise a distributed system of pipes will be needed. Pressure to push the water around the system will have to come from either high elevation reservoirs or water towers. Waste - One of largest factors in the extension of the human life expectancy was the toilet. Getting excremental waste away from the places where humans will eat and sleep will prevent disease and parasite proliferation. Roadways and logistics networks - As the settlement grows, it will become vital to be able to move people and goods around in a safe and efficent manner. Roadways and thoroughfares will have to be established, as well as methods for the movement of goods (Teamsters, delivery persons etc) Power - Assuming there was no portable nuclear reactors etc stored for this eventuality (and the skills to safely use them), then the only viable means to generate power will be kinetic based renewable power generators. Solar panels will not be viable as it is a complex industrial process to create even minimally efficient photo-voltaic solar panels. The most suitable power sources will be hydroelectric and wind powered generators as these are relatively simple to construct and materials will be readily available for construction Schools - While one of the lesser immediately important pieces, having a existing knowledge base to begin with is a huge advantage in getting started, but more importantly to prevent knowledge degradation, a school system coupled with an apprentice type system will be vital to ensure the preservation of knowledge especially around complicated technology and processes Policing - Inevitably, with any larger population, some degree of criminality or behavior that infringes on the freedom of others will occur. Establishing early a system of fair assessment of crime and punishment will be important to preserve the necessary happiness and productive societal attitude (ie. Widespread lawlessness and infighting would destabilize the population to the point of self-destruction) Culture - As the settlement advances and becomes more populous, a cultural identity and formal structure for creative arts to flourish will provide happiness and sense of identity to the society, which is an important basis for the settlements longevity.
