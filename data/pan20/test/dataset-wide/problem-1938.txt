Check the policy of your company regarding transfers. This is important if they provide any bonus for taking the position, or if they help pay moving expenses. In these cases they may require you to pay back part or all of the bonus money or moving expenses if you leave before a year. In some companies you may also be blocked from applying for other positions within the company after transferring to a new position. Assuming there is nothing you signed that will limit your ability to quit, then there is nothing stopping you from looking for jobs outside the company. I have not jumped to a position in order to move cities, but in cases where one project was ending I have made a jump to another project for coverage, while I continued to look outside the company. If you do this the new project won't be happy, but they also know that anytime somebody joins their project it doesn't always end up working out. 

The BBB in the US has nothing to do with the treatment of employees. Though poor conditions for employees will eventually result in poor customer service either because of constant turnover, or the poor mood of the employees. Their ratings tend to only be about resolving disputes. Here is a quote regarding a famous software company 

If you were unemployed, or facing a getting laid off, then then your would be comparing their offer to zero. They gave you an offer of more than a 25% increase and benefits. Compered to your current job which has no benefits. They are most likely aware what you currently make and the benefits you get at the current company. If they know they have the first two points covered it will be hard to get them to budge. The best chance to negotiate is the working conditions. This could be being allowed to work a modified schedule (10 hours per day for 4 days a week), or 1 day a week from home. You don't need a huge justification: I like to go camping, I have to watch the kids, it will save on computing costs. It also won't really cost them any money. Of course you might find out that those conditions are available for everybody. Current employment is a strength only if you are willing to reject the job offer. The more demanding you counter offer the greater the risk they will go with their next choice. They might not be able to offer you more money, the pay may be locked into a budget, or contract. If that is the case any counter offer for money or benefits will be bad. 

There is a tendency to avoid using the word junior in a job title. If there are going to be two tiers for a particular job, some will be called Senior X, and the rest will be X. When only one has the title Senior, it may be that they are more of an emeritus, they used to be at the C-level and are now functioning as an adviser. This allows them to work fewer hours, or with a greater level of pay or benefits. It can also be used to signify that they are expected to move to the next level when an opening occurs. 

What was wrong with the old procedures? What solution was the scanner trying to solve? Don't make the new procedure / policy to use the scanner. Change how the entire process works. EDIT: Regarding "how does management enforce policy when the enforcers fail to hold themselves accountable" This sounds like you are mad at the new boss. It may be that the issue might be you. There are several possibilities that need to be addressed. 1) The procedures to maintain accountability might be overkill. 

Handle the chat the same way you would handle a phone call from the client. You would politely ask your co-worker to step out of the office for a few minutes while you discuss a confidential topic. In the case of a confidential chat you would ask them to politely step back from your machine. I do see two issues with your situation. 

It will depend on the type of job you have and the required staffing of that job. I have worked at locations where a position must be staffed 100% of the time, and the breaks and meals are regulated. If you step away from the position many more times compared to the rest of your co-workers, their perception of you will be as not being a team player. Every time you leave the desk somebody has to cover for you, or the workplace has to come to a halt. It might be beneficial to call them snacks, but you also have to be willing to eat them at your desk if they are snacks. If they involve heating of leftovers, or cooking of food, nobody will believe that you can keep to the standard 30 or 60 minutes that everybody else has. Calling them the equivalent of smoke break might be more problematic. Smoke breaks are being highly discouraged in many places due to the disruptions they cause. The round trip to the designated smoking area can add 10 to 15 minutes to the process. If your workplace doesn't have tight regulations, why bother asking? If they are really small snacks, just eat them ask your desk. Act the same way as somebody who can't get through the workday without visiting the vending machine, the coffee machine, or the soda machine 3 or 4 times a day. 

They expect you to use either their corporate system to apply for the job, or the system provided by the job board to apply. Many companies don't want applicants to contact the hiring manager, recruiter or HR POC directly. They don't want to be disturbed. The lack of deadline may mean that they are hiring these positions frequently. They may need one or two a month and they just look through the recent applications whenever they have a project or contract that needs that position. That would also explain the lack of contact info because they have no idea which projecy will be sifting through the resumes the next time they need a junior technical (data science) person. 

Ignore the age of the interviewer. Several years ago my sons university had students participate in the interview process for a dean. That's right students participated in interviews for somebody would would be the boss of the instructors and professors. Not all interviewers are management. I have been in ones where I was there because I did a similar job; other times I was there because they would be on my team; another time I was the only appropriate person who could get to the interview site in the next 10 minutes. I have conducted interviews in restaurants, and I was once interviewed at a pancake restaurant over breakfast. Location doesn't matter. 

Make them yourself to bridge the gap between now and when the official ones arrive. This was something that was typically done in the past. The process of getting cards could take weeks, but this was encouraged to make sure you had some cards if you knew you needed them. Business supply stores sell paper that goes in the printer and is used to make a sheet of cards. You can also find templates either in your word processing software or the company that makes the paper has a site you can download it. They help make sure your design fits exactly on the cards. Yes these aren't the best looking. You can tell they were from perforated card stock. You have to find a company logo. If you have another employees card you can make yours look similar. Also order official ones through the company, they aren't very expensive. Many places can get business cards done overnight. The last time I joined a company my manager sent me an email to confirm the spelling of my name, email address, and the phone numbers. The cards arrived 2 business day later. Your management should be able to do this. A thousand custom printed cards in my area is less than $20. Overnight.
