Go late in the day, when you've been walking around, and your feet are already sweaty and swollen. Your feet will naturally go up a size when active, and this represents your default when hiking. Boots tested in the morning with fresh feet will suddenly seem too small when you've been hiking for a few hours. Wear the socks you intend to hike with. The proper fit of your boot should take this into account. I prefer one thin sock and one thick sock (two socks will rub each other, instead of your skin, reducing the likelihood of blisters). Bring your socks to the shop with you and wear them while testing. If you forget, a good shop will usually have a few test pairs. Try out different terrain and force. The salesperson already did some of this, but many good shops will have a little artificial hill with cobbles for you to walk up and down (often like this or this). You'll get an idea for how your feet slide around inside the boots, and if you need more toe space or a different shape of boot. Try to wear a heavy load too, to get a feel for how the boots perform under a real-life scenario. If it's an outdoors shop, their rucksack section will have weights for testing the bags - borrow some, or bring your own from home (I know my local shop keeps stacks of old telephone books taped together, for exactly this purpose). Remember that the rucksack with weight will change your center of gravity, which will affect how your feet touch the ground. 

Honestly, there isn't much you can't do with a decent mid-sized fixed blade (your basic 3-4" Mora type) with a Scandi (flat) grind, and a small axe for processing firewood. With practice, you can also use the axe head for planing and shaving wood (tinder, feather sticks, etc). A 6" knife is completely overkill unless you're also hunting and gutting your own food. In my experience, a multi-tool has more design compromises than advantages for bushcraft, and I no longer carry one. Folding blades in general are also riskier, in the event you need to do something that stresses the blade, as the hinge is a potential point of failure. A lot of discussions online seem to focus on batoning with a knife, which I would strongly recommend against, in favour of either an axe, or bludgeoning wooden wedges with another piece of wood. I also used to (and still occasionally) carry a lightweight folding saw, where the blade stows inside the handle, but I also find rare use for it that can't be done with an axe. Those little chain saws that are a piece of serrated wire are little better than gimmicks. I wouldn't carry a sharpening stone for just a few days' trip, but a small stone or lapstone is handy for longer trips. This can be shared in a group. Beyond those, you could take a hardened plastic trowel for a lightweight digging tool (outdoor shops often sell these), but with your axe and knife, it's also easy enough to shape a pointy piece of wood to accomplish the same job. It mostly comes down to skill with the blades (practice) and creativity in improvising tools and solutions out in the field, rather than bringing everything and the kitchen sink with you. 

Actually, Kamtschatka would be the one place I would really want to go to in Russia. And since it is rather difficult to get there (remoteness, special permits), it is also the one place in Russia for which I would consider joining an expedition. Other than that, I am not that familiar with what there is in the country. Well, Baikal lake, of course, but an expedition is probably not really necessary for it. Maybe Altai or Ural mountains? Maybe smth in Siberia? Assuming that it would be possible to avoid being eaten by the always-hungry Siberian mosquitos.. 

I believe you should search for backpacks that are specifically marketed for snow-shoeing/ backcountry skiing and check if they allow carrying ice tools as well. I haven't tested it myself, but it looks like Osprey Kode 30 could be a good fit for you. Well, at least if you don't require a bigger bag. Also, the post seems a bit old, not sure if they still sell those backpacks. In any case, from my experience most of backcountry skiing backpacks do offer a possibility to attach ice tools in one way or another, but I have no idea if they are any good for carrying snow shoes. 

Would they also be useful on ice in summer? I mean small ice fields or non-serious glaciers. Are they in any way comparable to crampons? Do people in general walk on glaciers wearing microspikes? 

I don't know where you live, but I am pretty sure that if you want to do paragliding, you are required to take a course and get a license. So I would say if you really want to do it, find a paragliding school, and they will teach you all you need. I don't think any specific skills are required. While landings in trees do happen, they are considered crashes, and are really not an everyday occurance. I think the only thing you should think about is your general fitness level. For a take off, you should be able to run a hundred meters or so. Nothing extreme though, I have seen lots of old paragliders. 

The Alta Vista hut is at 3260 meters above the sea level. That means you would need to do all those hight meters in one day. While not undoable, as we can see from the other comments, you have to be quite a beast to accomplish it. I personally would never plan anything more than 2000 height meters for a day. But if you hike, you should know your own limits yourself. As hiking goes, the hike itself is fairly easy, you don't need any particular experience or equipment for it. Just bring (lots of) water and food for the trip. Keep in mind that the hut does not serve any food whatsoever, well, they do sell some overpriced candies, that's it. You can cook though, and the water is sort of OK for drinking there, at least after boiling it first. I believe you have done your research, but in case you did not: you will need a permit to climb to the summit. Permits are free and easy to apply for online, but the amount of them is limited, and they run out really fast. If you stay in the hut, you are allowed to go to the summit the next morning. The hut fills up pretty quickly too, but there always are cancellations. And what concerns altitude sickness, I would not be too worried about that. At this altitude (what matters is the altitude you sleep at), there is very little chance you will get altitude sickness. And if you do, it is really easy to descent, even at night. 

It would probably be best to leave the task of euthanizing the animal to the professionals, unless you are absolutely certain that the animal is enduring intense pain and suffering, and has no chance of recovering. If the animal is clearly dying a slow and painful death, you can ease its suffering, but if you're uncertain or uncomfortable doing it, you'll probably do more harm than good. If you can do it properly, in a calm and steady manner, the best of your very bad options are going to be quite gruesome. You can kill it by severing the head from the body with a swift blow with an axe or shovel, or by crushing the skull very quickly, and with enough force to crush the brain itself. However, I absolutely don't recommend either of these options. The potential for mishaps is too great, and the consequences of failure are too severe. Slitting the throat is not as painless as has been suggested above, and it causes profound terror and pain, regardless of how brief it might be. It's also easy to do it the wrong way, which is even worse. The same is true of trying to snap the neck. The first time you try it, you're probably going to be nervous and shaky, which makes it more likely that you'll just make the animal suffer more. If you're not a veterinarian, you aren't well suited to judge whether the animal needs to be killed. If you've never killed an animal before, you aren't likely to do it properly. If you try and fail, you're extremely likely to increase the animal's distress and pain. The only clear solution is to call someone who knows how to determine the need for euthanasia, and how to carry out euthanasia properly. Your compassion is commendable, but it's best to let the experts handle situations like this. 

Emergency Method of Walking a Short Distance on Ice Without Slipping: If you find yourself on ice unexpectedly and you don't have far to go, an emergency option is to remove your shoes/boots entirely and walk in your stocking feet. This is obviously not a good idea if you're not going to be indoors within a couple of minutes, but if you're just walking from the car to your house, it works quite well. The idea is that your body heat can pass through the socks, melting the top layer of ice. Your socks absorb this melted ice, but immediately refreeze, which means that your sock is now glued to the ice. The adhesive properties aren't strong enough to keep you from moving, so you can simply take another step, your sock sticks to the ice again, and so on. Low Cost, DIY Solution: A more long-term solution is to get an old pair of boots with thick soles, preferably with the treads still more or less intact. Buy some short wood screws with rounded heads and screw them into the soles of the boots. Obviously, you have to make sure that the scres aren't so long that they go all the way through the sole and into your feet. Arrange the screws in a grid pattern, with maybe an inch or an inch and a half between them. If the boots are the slip-on/slip-off variety, you can easily put them on and take them off when entering and leaving buildings. Be careful not to wear them on wood or tile floors, because the screws will damage hard surfaces. This is basically the way old fashioned hobnail boots worked, and it still works today. All together, the materials shouldn't cost more than a few dollars, and if you already have an old pair of boots, the cost will be no more than a dollar or two. The Best Way to Walk on Ice: You will slip less if you don't lift your feet at all. Pretend you're ice skating, and slide instead of walking. The reason this works is that you are keeping the largest possible surface area of your feet in contact with the ice, which provides the maximum amount of friction. Since ice and friction don't like each other, this technique isn't foolproof, but in the absence of any better options, it is the best you can do. The next best option is, as previous answers have already said, to take baby steps. The shorter your stride, the less momentum you have, and it is less likely that you will go ass over elbows. Move as slowly as you can, and keep your feet close together.
