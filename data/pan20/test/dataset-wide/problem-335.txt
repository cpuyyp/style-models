Yes, I think it could. Minting new currency at a constant rate should be roughly equivalent to collecting a yearly tax consisting of a fixed percentage of each citizen's currency holdings. 

As you might expect, there are lots of slurs behind most of the links in this answer. Given the frequency with which marginalized groups reappropriate slurs, I think it's likely that at least some mutants would call themselves mutants, around each other and maybe also around genotypical people. I think it's equally likely that many hypervariant and hyperabled people would be wary of reappropriation efforts. I expect clinical terms taking on lives of their own, names originating as slang within charm communities, names constructed to emphasize Varied people's friendliness and respectability, names reflecting the gallows humor of the freaks and the Cursed, insipid Latinate terms intended to convey neutrality toward parahumans but crawling with fear and revulsion, and hopefully also enthusiastic co-opting of classic monster movies. 

For simplicity, let's say the humans and the humanoids both descend from the same group of ancestors, who reproduced sexually like humans do. During their isolation from the humans, the humanoids transitioned from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis. In humans, the X chromosome carries genes that are essential to life. An embryo with no X chromosome can't survive long enough to develop into a baby. A human with only one X chromosome, on the other hand, can survive just fine. There's a lot of evolutionary pressure for genes on the X chromosome to function properly in people with only one X chromosome, because nearly half of all humans have only one X chromosome! If a human gene on the X chromosome mutates and loses its ability to function in people with only one X chromosome, the mutant version of the gene will be at a severe evolutionary disadvantage, and it will probably die out very quickly. Among the humanoids, on the other hand, pretty much everyone has two X chromosomes. That means there's very little evolutionary pressure for genes on the X chromosome to function properly in people with only one X chromosome. If a humanoid gene on the X chromosome mutates and loses its ability to function in people with only one X chromosome, the mutant version of the gene won't have any serious disadvantage, and nothing will stop it from spreading through the population. Eventually, just by chance, the original version of the gene could disappear completely from the population, leaving only the mutant version. Let's imagine that this has happened several times, so the humanoid X chromosome carries a bunch of genes that only work properly in people with two X chromosomes. A humanoid embryo with a missing X chromosome will be very unlikely to survive and develop, just like a human embryo missing an ordinary chromosome. Now, imagine a humanoid mates with a human carrying sex chromosomes XY, and an embryo starts to develop. If the embryo inherits the human's X chromosome, it will have two X chromosomes in total—one from the humanoid and one from the human. The genes on its X chromosomes have a good chance of functioning properly, because there are two X chromosomes present, and the genes on the human X chromosome would be able to function pretty well on their own anyway. The embryo can survive and develop. If the embryo inherits the human's Y chromosome, on the other hand, it will only have on X chromosome—a humanoid X chromosome, which carries a bunch of genes that don't work in people with only one X chromosome. The embryo is very unlikely to survive. This is exactly this situation you're looking for: humanoids and humans can mate and make embryos, and only the embryos with two X chromosomes can survive and develop into babies. When those babies grow up, however, they'll have a very weird power. The child of a humanoid and a human will typically carry two X chromosomes: one humanoid and one human. If the child grows up and mates with a human, they could make an embryo with both a human X chromosome and a human Y chromosome! A humanoid and a human can't have XY children, but they can have XY grandchildren. 

I'm disappointed by how many of the answers so far seem to take it for granted that currencies are supposed to be stable. While it's true that most people in our world expect currencies to be fairly stable, I think that's to some extent a historical accident. This answer is meant as a proof of concept that things could have gone another way. Sorry about the double post. Of course! Where I'm from, pretty much every nation funds itself this way. The roots of the system go all the way back to the Age of Heroes, when lords would often award marques of favor to vassals who distinguished themselves by feats of courage or devotion. The earliest marques were little trinkets handmade in a wide variety of styles and materials, often blessed by the lord herself. These tokens of honor were highly sought after, so those who recieved them would often pass them down to their own vassals in exchange for services, in addition to awarding their own marques. Some marques grew in value through fame, or a reputation for good luck. In the 3500s, for example, King Latia gave 60 cut amethysts to each of the seven Countesses of Nome after they rode to his aid during the Hyperborean War. When Nome miraculously escaped the regional plague of the following years, rumors spread that the amethysts were the cause. Their precipitous rise in value helped drive Nome's snowballing political and financial influence over the next century. An important feature of the favor system was that, with their supply always growing as lords handed them out, marques steadily decreased in value. That meant heroes couldn't rest on their laurels, living off the proceeds of deeds long past; they had to keep up a steady stream of accomplishments in order to maintain their power. Since opportunities for glorious combat were limited, lords increasingly called on their vassals in peacetime to work on civil projects like irrigation and road-building, unwittingly laying the foundations for the great kingdoms of the Times of the Sages. But devaluation had a downside, too: as marques accumulated, and their value decreased, physically storing and trading them became a major hassle. It became common practice for vassals to return marques to their lords every few years in exchange for "new marques," each representing a large batch of the old. Marques became more standardized and mass-produced—no more personal blessings by the lord—and began to be routinely stamped with dates. At the dawn of the Times of the Sages, feudal alliances were rapidly coalescing into giant kingdoms with monarchs at the top. Most lords stopped awarding their own marques entirely, since those of the monarch and her handmaidens were better respected, and they trickled down reliably from above. They could also be conveniently traded between provinces within the kingdom. (Incidentally, this is why a lot of modern currencies are called the heighmarque, or some variant of that—it started as "the high queen's marque.") As kingdoms solidified their internal currencies, however, they became more economically isolated from each other. Rulers grew to distrust each other's marques, whose values could suddenly tank if their issuers decided to do an enormous land buyout or launch an expedition to the South Pole. Merchant families stepped in to fill the gap by trading in goods between kingdoms. When they needed cash to kickstart a new trade route, they'd borrow it from well-to-do locals, and the modern banking industry was born. Four hundred years ago, the "bricks" in your TeaBank account (or your Lower Port Province Trade Route account, as it was then called) stood for literal bricks of tea, bought with your deposits and destined for buyers overseas. Marques got even more mass-produced, turning into dyed wood sticks or paper notes, and newmarques began to be issued on a regular basis. Spending was slower back then, and hauling marques around took more work, so replacement periods of seven, nine, or eleven years were common, rather than the four or five typical today. The world saw its first modern spending crisis in the 4160s, when the Empress of Noba, trying to raise an army for a war of expansion, ended up pricing the kingdom's farmers out of the labor market instead, setting off the Farmers' Revolt. As the era of mechanization rolled in, nascent manufacturers got into the banking business for the same reason the merchant families had centuries prior. By accounting in symbolic shares of their factories—early Windloom Atlantis accounts were measured in "blades of the windmills"—they introduced the idea that banking currencies needn't be tied to tangible goods. By the mid-4400s, nearly all banking currencies had become fiat currencies, regulated by international trade groups. The transition was not without mishap: banks' formulas for setting the marque values of their supposedly time-stable fiat currencies were often complicated and opaque, leading to protracted court battles and the eventual passage of national and international banking currency rules. The practice of giving "compensation payments" to poor citizens whenever marque was printed, as a way to maintain the buying power of those with low incomes and little access to banking, had been around since the Times of the Sages. It was only in the late 4300s, however, that the spread of democracy and calls for a stronger social safety net led to a serious study of compensations. Today, most nations have quite involved compensation systems, with price-indexed payments, payroll deductions, and adjustments for assets in the bank. Our financial system looks a lot different than it did a millenium ago, but some things don't really change. TeaBank still trades a lot of tea, although the cute tea brick icon next to your balance is purely fictional. The High Count of Nome still blows a theatrical kiss over the national mint every Budget Day, so those marques really are "Printed with the Blessing of Our Sovereign." And we're all still hustling to keep up with the marque supply, because no matter how stable our banking currencies are advertised to be, the old saying still goes: "Yesterday's glory won't buy tomorrow's arrows."
