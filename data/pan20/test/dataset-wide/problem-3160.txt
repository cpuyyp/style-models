Toy v. American Family Mutual Insurance Company, 2014 WL 321213 (D. Colo. January 29, 2014) (footnotes omitted). As Sutherland's Statutory Construction explains the general rule followed by all American courts: 

16 C.J.S. Constitutional Law ยง 58 (footnotes omitted). In the recent U.S. Supreme Court gun control case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634-35 (2008), Justice Scalia explained "Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad." Similarly, U.S. courts look closely to the intent of Congress unless the statute is clear on its face. Using Colorado as an example, one court summarized this rule: 

Of course, not all Jews went to Europe. Babylonia continued to be a hub of Jewish learning and culture, that it had been after the destruction of the First Temple, until the 11th century, A.D., corresponding with the violent invasion of the Islamic Empire. See Dimont, p. 185; Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon ("[The] Epistle of Rav Sherira Gaon"). Also, many Jews never left Palestine, although the Romans prevented the Jewish return to Jerusalem until after the death of Hadrian in 138 A.D. Jews were again exiled from Jerusalem following the rise of the Byzantines in the third century AD. The Jewish presence in Palestine peaked in the 4th century, living in 43 Jewish communities. By 638, A.D., when the Islamic Empire took control of Palestine, at least one study estimated that between 300,000 and 400,000 Jews lived in Palestine. Jews also lived in Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Tunisia and Morocco after the collapse of the Second Temple in 70 A.D., until the establishment of the modern Israeli Jewish state. You asked when and why Jews moved from Germany to Palestine. Emigration of Jews from Europe began at the end of the 19th century, following the Dreyfus Affair in France and the rise of Zionism, increasing following the Balfour Declaration where the United Kingdom expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Emigration from Europe to Palestine increased further with the rise of Nazism in Germany. Dimont, p. 287. 

It seems to me that the disease existed for years but lacked a name. During the Civil War, there was a malady known as Da Costa's syndrome which was a combination cardiac and anxiety syndrome connected to battle. In World War II, PTSD was essentially documented by combat artist Thomas Lea in his painting "The Thousand-yard Stare," and also apparent in this photo of a Marine after two days of fighting at Eniwetok. 

There is no one answer to your question. The outcome depended not only on the strength of the fortress, but also the force ratio, the capability of each side to endure a war of attrition (i.e. logistics), the determination of each side to win despite the costs, and superiority of weaponry. See, generally, [Kress and Talmor, "A New Look at the 3:1 Rule of Combat through Markov, Stochastic and Lanchester Models," Journal of the Operational Research Society, 50 733-44 (1999)].1 Historically, armies (and their navies) preferred to avoid direct confrontation with a fortress (both before firearms and afterwards). Going over or around the fortress is preferential, with modern examples being the German avoidance of the Maginot Line, and the US invasion of Kuwait. If that were not possible, then armies would prefer a siege of the castle or walled city (or an entire country). Josephus tells us that but for Israelite zealots destroying food stores in the walled city of Jerusalem -- to force Israel to fight -- Jerusalem might have been able to withstand a long siege and would have the motivation to hold out. The Romans, however, having to answer to Rome and explain why the Legion was unable to put down the revolt, had little motivation for a long siege. Superiority of weaponry was a major factor. In the pre-gunpowder days, the relative strength of spears and shields were key factors as metallurgy evolved. In the 19th century, especially during the American Civil War, the Union Army's acquisition of guns that could be reloaded and fire more rapidly than the guns of its enemies, played a huge role in its victory. 

In addition to Santiago's answer, I would add that the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, and the Japanese defeat at Midway, led to the Japanese forces taking a more conservative stand and prevented them from taking full advantage of their victory at Pearl Harbor. Francis Pike, in his book, Hirohito's War: the Pacific War 1941-1945, the Doolittle Raid was a "stunning blow" to the pride of the Japanese Navy. Admiral Yamamoto was forced to deliver a "groveling" personal apology to the Emperor. Pike writes, "from a practical point of view the raid's most significant and lasting effect was to draw more war resources to home defense than had previously been the case. In addition, the loss of so many of the Navy's top pilots during the battle of Guadalcanal. According to interrogations of Japanese officers, The Japanese lost 1000 pilots from August 1942 to 1943 during the U.S. invasion of Guadalcanal and its long struggle to hold it. Japan lost in additional 1500 pilots in 1943 in the Munda-New Georgia-Bougainville defense. Contrary to other views, I think that the U.S. Navy's success in code-breaking is a bit over-rated, aside from the extra advantage it gave the U.S. at Midway, when compared to the US manufacturing capabilities. According to Michael Smith, author of The Emperor's Codes: The Thrilling Story of the Allied Code Breakers Who Turned the Tide of World War II, the U.S. and British code-breakers had difficulty with Japanese naval and army operations messages because the uniformed services were a bit more careful to change their codebooks, and allied code-breakers had difficulty keeping up. Nevertheless, the Japanese were over-confident that their language itself would cause troubles for the allies to decode and translate coded messages. Also the Japanese were less careful in operational radio security rules, sending some messages in the clear, and using identical language in addressing certain officials. That being said, the US weapons manufacturing and shipbuilding capabilities, and the resolution of the fuses on submarine torpedoes, made the Allied forces unbeatable. However, after the grueling battles to take Guadalcanal, Okinawa, Saipan, and Luzon convinced Allied leaders that any attack on the Japanese mainland would be a long war of attrition and force the allies to take arms against women, children, and the elderly. 

The Bismark's limited escorts was not uncommon for surface raiders. It was common since the Age of Sail for large combatants to sail independently without escorts who would require logistics support along the way. In some ways, traveling alone was an advantage, especially in waters like the south Atlantic where the Bismark was unlikely to see enemy submarines. But the reality was that the big ships were vulnerable to naval air power and submarines. The quick sinking of the HMS Hood came as a great shock to the British people and gave root to the fear that the UK might lose the war. Churchill, therefore, made sinking the Bismark a priority, sending a massive force to defeat it. A few destroyers or cruiser escorts probably would not have made much difference at that point. Bismark's lack of escort ships had much to do with the German Navy's shift in strategy that emphasized submarines over big surface ships. In many ways, the shift to submarines -- made after a spending spree on battleships and cruisers during the 1930s -- made sense if the mission of the Navy was to be denial of access to British merchant ships, the same strategy Germany used in World War I. As an anti-access weapon, the submarine is ideal. It can be built quickly and cheaply and were deadly against unescorted merchant vessels. So through 1943, the German Navy's large submarine service and battleships like the Bismark, forced allied forces to assign destroyers and battleships (and later small aircraft carriers) to protect convoys. Production of submarines, almost exclusively by the end of the war, also made sense because it demanded less steel from German industry than the Army and Air Force. The shift to submarine construction, however, deprived the Navy of the ability to support an amphibious assault against the United Kingdom. Navy chief, Admiral Erich Raeder, had never considered that invasion would be Germany's goal and had not constructed the Navy with that goal. Moreover, the UK's breaking of Germany's submarine codes, the development of sonar, airborne radar, and radio detection techniques ("Huff-Duff"), turned the tables on the submarines, too. 

2A Southerland ยง 48.3 (footnotes omitted). Based on the foregoing, I believe that you have misinterpreted Ms. Shiao's prosecution as a failure to understand legislative intent, or to understand it as a move away by courts to follow the intent of legislators in intepreting statutes. 

The question, and most of the answers are based on a false premise -- it is not true that the U.S. Navy has abandoned the use of armor. During the 1960s and 1970s, speed, maneuverability, and the use of missile counter-measures, were hoped to be enough to protect ships like the Leahy (CG-16) and Belknap class guided missile cruisers (although originally built as "frigates" -- actually destroy leaders) and the Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7) Class frigates were made without armor and with aluminum superstructures. After the 1987 missile attack on the USS Stark (FFG-37), and the 1988 mine hit on the USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58), led to incredibly hot fires fueled by the aluminum hulls (aluminum burns at relatively low temperatures compared to steel). Also, the Navy had a bad experience with fragmentation of a missile (one of our own, unfortunately), slicing through the Combat Information Center of the USS Worden (DLG-18, later CG-18), resulting in a mission kill. With the construction of the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class of guided missile destroyers, in the late 1998s, and still under construction, the Navy made the ships more blast resistant, gave them more armor over vital sections (like the CIC)a steel superstructure, and made the ship more stealthy to protect it from radar guided missiles. The Arleigh Burke class also possesses superior capabilities to protect its sailors from radiation within the skin of the vessel during a nuclear attack assuming that Circle William protocols have been ordered. The newest destroyer class, led by the recently commissioned USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), in addition to the type of armor given the DDG-51 class, the Zumwalt class borrows an armor enhancement system from tanks, by installing vertically launched missile containers along the outer edges of the hull. If a missile hits one of the launchers, the missile inside will blow the force outboard. The Soviets similarly protected its Oscar class anti-carrier submarines, forcing an enemy to have its torpedos pass through missile launchers before reaching the inner hull. As for other ships, the Nimitz class carriers have had their vital spaces armored with Kevlar since the Nimitz became the first of its class to join the fleet in 1987.
