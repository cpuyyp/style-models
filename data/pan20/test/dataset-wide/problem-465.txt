In general, yes, different brands of mineral fluid are compatible (including the stuff used in Citroen cars). If you switch to another brand of mineral fluid, it's probably best to flush the brake entirely, rather than just bleeding. however, DOT fluid cannot be used in a Mineral fluid brake, and vice-versa. DOT will eat through the seals used in Mineral brakes. 

I suspect Shimano don't consider it to be necessary for their brakes. The fluid used in Avid and Shimano brakes is completely different, so I imagine it needs to be handled differently. 

Put simply, a master of a craft will be better at it than a "jack of all trades". A dedicated cross country race bike will be better for XC racing than an All Mountain bike. The same would be true of the dedicated downhill race bike. An All Mountain bike strikes a compromise in the middle, making it a good choice for someone who wants to do a bit of everything. It's a bit more complex than that though, e.g. the Specialized Enduro makes different compromises to their Stumpjumper Evo. One is closer to the DH end of the spectrum, while the other is more of an XC/Trail machine. Cherouvim's answer points out some of the compromises (geometry, inefficiency, weight, flex, cost). Others include things like wheel size (XC racers might want a 29er, DH racers a 26er, and Enduro riders — who do a bit of both — might go for 27.5) and axle size (9mm QR is lighter but more flexible than 20mm thru). Which compromise you choose depends on what you want to ride! The "do everything" bike you describe would be complex and compromised, but it does exist: 

This is best done by picking difficult challenges that you enjoy. It could be getting a BMX bike and working to learn one trick after another. It could be setting a speed goal for yourself that really forces you to push yourself. It could be any number of things. Just set challenging goals and surround yourself with others that will push you to reach them. 

• This is the shopping center intersection. The light further in the distance (500 ft in actuality) is where the intersection is. Cars would typically get in the second lane (not the left into the intersection but the one after that) and then as they cross the intersection get over into the turn lane. You can see this is what the SUV is doing in the picture. I would think this would then be the safest way for cyclists to do it as well but would have to take that lane so cars getting into the left don't cross into me: 

First thing to do is check all the pivot bolts are tight. If that doesn't fix it, figure out where the play is. Is it in the swingarm pivot, or the shock bushings? You can figure it out by holding onto each joint in turn and moving the swingarm. You shoukld be able to feel which part is loose. If it's been like it for a while, it might be all three points. Once you find the source of the problem, I guess you'll need to go to your local bike shop (or the place you got the bike - Decathlon?) and see if they're able to source the spare parts. Shock bushings should be easy enough to get, but I don't know about the pivot hardware. You'd need to open it up and have a look what's in there! 

My feeling The bike you chose looks odd to me but if it makes you happy it also looks versatile and fun. I could see taking to some trails and little jumps on it. Otherwise the more I write the more I'm inclined to suggest a smaller BMX bike like: 

I'm no expert in racing or anything but the calves shouldn't be activated almost at all when cycling to my knowledge. You're not extending the calves at the bottom of the stroke and the amount of pressure would be insignificant unless you're deliberately extending the calves while on a very hard gear / slope. If anything this calf extension would be less efficient. Calves are a very difficult muscle to train and requires serious weight. If you see a cyclists with large calves its most likely from one or a combination of the following: 

Different brakes use different designs and different fluids, and as such have slightly different bleed kits and procedures. I've answered what I can below. 

Fit a proper DH fork (e.g. a Rockshox Boxxer) and a direct mount stem Bodge a longer stroke shock into the frame (if you can find a pull-shock that long) Now your head angle and bottom bracket are in a crazy place, fit an angle headset (Works Components or Cane Creek) and/or some offset shock bushings (e.g. Burgtec) to put them back somewhere vaguely sensible Fit some heavy duty wheels (e.g. Hope Pro2Evo + Stans FlowEX, or Mavic DeeMax) Remove the front derailleur, and replace it with a single chainring and a chain device Replace the cassette with a close ratio one and switch to a short-cage derailleur while you're at it Upgrade to 203mm disc rotors and Shimano Saint brakes 

You can generally find them pretty cheap (not this model but other ones). They're incredibly durable. Relaxing for when you do want those roaming around trips, but can also be pushed for the fitness side. And learning a new trick or jump will burn less calories so you don't lose weight. Loads of fun too! 

What would be the best way to get in to the left lane? I've seen cyclists there so I know it can be done, just never seen the whole process. I'm thinking after writing this: 

Is it considered bad etiquette to ride a road bike through a small residential area? Not talking about a cheap bike and riding on the sidewalk but a nicer road bike at a decent pace. I don't want to upset anyone by cutting through their neighborhood but it would be a lot easier for my commute. 

Only with manufacturer-specific parts, and only with hubs that were designed to be adapted (e.g. you could probably adapt a 15mm bolt-thru hub to 9mm, but not the other way around). For example, Hope will sell you adaptors to let you use Pro 2 Evo hubs with these drop-outs: 

Your bike uses a "high direct mount" front derailleur - so yes, you can upgrade to an X0, as long as it's a high direct mount model. SRAM and Shimano both sell "non-group" transmission and braking components, usually only to OEM customers (i.e. the bike manufacturers). This means they aren't in a "group" (e.g. X7, X9, XX1, Deore, SLX, XT, etc) but allow bike manufacturers to hit a certain price point. For instance I've got some brakes and hubs that're roughly equivalent to Shimano Deore components, but they're fairly plain looking, with only a Shimano logo on them. They're perfectly good parts - just not quite as high end / refined as as the ones that get the nice branding. 

First and most important is the depression. You should really go to a bike shop and hop on a few different bikes and styles. Try them all. The one that makes you feel giddy and excited is the one to get. Pleasure, smiling, laughter, and exercise all release endorphins which help depression. Get the one that will not only give you exercise but also make you feel great! This is also how you will know if it is comfortable and fits you. 

get into the left lane right before the shopping center intersection when its still 2 lanes. staying right in the middle of that left lane forcing cars to slow down behind you if there are any cars. (Of course only taking the lane when there is ample time for the car to slow down) Get over into the (right-most) left turn lane once across the shopping center intersection. 

Once you've spent all that money, you'll have a complete mess of a frankenbike that doesn't work anywhere near as well as a proper DH bike. As Vorac commented, you're better off buying used. The Specialized Status is a good value place to start looking. With that said, an angle headset might help make the bike more confident on the descents, without completely ruining it. 

Additionally, many forks offer a travel adjust option (e.g. Rockshox Dual Position and Fox TALAS). They tend to be big, stiff and relatively heavy forks which work best in their longer travel mode, but can be lowered in order to aid climbing up really steep ascents. However, they're far too heavy for XC racers. If you made them light enough for XC racing, they'd be too flexible for the more gravity-focussed riders. Additionally, the adjustable spring can have an effect of the suspension's sensitivity. They're a compromise. By the way, features such as Fox's CTD/ProPedal and Cane Creek's Climb Switch don't usually limit suspension travel. They firm up the shock's Compression (and in some cases Rebound) damping. This is to improve the pedalling efficiency of a longer-travel suspension design, in order to help with climbing, or riding on flatter, smoother terrain. They can still use all of the travel if they need to. The climb setting is a compromise. Those compromises aren't necessarily a bad thing though: They enable me to ride my 150mm travel 30lb bike up and down some of the craziest terrain you can imagine. It'll probalby never win an XC or DH race, but it's still a fantastic bike.
