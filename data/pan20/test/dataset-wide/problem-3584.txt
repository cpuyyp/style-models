This is probably off topic. However if what you're having is gynecomastia brought on by puberty you should talk to your doctor, instead of asking for advice on the internet. 

I've heard much anecdotal evidence from a lot of powerlifting friends of mine that they pain in their wrists/elbows/shoulders from squatting heavy with the low-bar style. So I think your assumption is correct. It's my understanding that people use the safety bar (spider bar, as you call it) for exactly this reason. There are other reasons, of course, but I've seen it most used for issues with pain in the shoulders/wrists developed while squatting heavy. At some level of strongman/powerlifting, squatting without any pain isn't very attainable. But you should always be working to mediate the pain you're feeling with the appropriate accessory movements. I agree with Mark Rippetoe that you can't let tendonitis slow you down. However there are a few things you can do to alleviate some pain: 

When the human body goes from laying prone to standing up there is a rapid, and brief, change in blood pressure. This is the likely cause. Some people are more susceptible than others, and it's called orthostatic hypotension, or sometimes, "vertigo." 

A very common 3-day split is push/pull/legs. If you google it there are a million different variations. Find one you like and tweak it to fit you as time goes on. Alternatively you could do a more "old school" bb'er routine like chest/tris, back/bis, shoulders/legs. 

When switching to power cleans and/or front squats for the first time you will start to notice that many areas of your body are not very flexible. This will adjust over time, however I would recommend that you do supplementary stretching. I am a big fan of Glenn Pendlay's videos when it comes to Olympic lifting, and this one is most appropriate for you. 

There are a few articles (below) that correlate decreased sleep to higher appetite, weight gain and risk of diabetes. The latter two might have more to do with the correlated increased desire for high-carb foods, rather than the actual loss of sleep. 

I've always considered it good practice to do calisthenics every day, if being good at calisthenics is your goal. Generally speaking calisthenics are useful for improving cardiovascular endurance, and the best practice for that is doing them often. Maybe you break up which exercises you do which day, ie chinups and prone bridge one day, pushups leg raises another, and do one group every day. 

Given you have restricted basically every parameter, I think your best bet is to get a rowing machine, stationary bike, or elliptical machine. 

Eat a banana pre- or post-workout Buy a stick massager (below) and roll your muscles with it. It works best if the muscle is constricted while being massaged. This puts you at risk of cramping, and makes it extremely painful, but it does wonders for loosening up my muscles. 

I've had great success lifting every day. However you need to give your body time to adapt. You can't start lifting as hard as you can every day, you will only hurt yourself. Start with 4 days then slowly add another day as you get used to the stress. Be mindful that your diet and sleeping are on point, they become much more important when you exert yourself that often. 

One easy way to do it without having to count calories is to standardize your diet. By that I mean eat the same thing for breakfast, lunch, dinner every day. It makes it easy to figure out how to tweak your diet to continue to lose weight. Another option is to get a calorie tracking app for your smartphone and track everything that way. It's a little more work, but it makes it easier to eat a diverse diet. You can also take appetite suppressants like coffee. There are herbal and OTC drugs you can take that are reasonably safe, but I'm not going to suggest any. However, I will note that if the product you're looking at has a name like "Fat Burn Extreme XXX" it's probably much more expensive than it needs to be. Another trick I've found it to split your meals (maybe eat 2 smaller lunches at work instead of one big one). And if you can arrange it, eat one of your meals right before you lift so you don't get too lightheaded when going heavy. One thing to keep in mind is that unless you're using anabolic agents, losing weight too fast can ruin your size and strength. This is one of the reasons people argue that the bulk/cut cycle isn't the most effective for the natural athlete. So I would say that 1-2lbs a week is the most you'd want to lose if you care about your strength levels after your cut. However you will likely lose a lot of water weight fast if you switch to a low carb diet so don't freak out about that. As for exercise: you might find that you can't handle the volume you're used to doing on a bulking routine. One way around this is to take pre-workout supplements and/or save some calories to drink a bit of Gatorade (or other sugary beverage) while you lift. And of course you should supplement creatine, this will add unnecessary bloat, but that's just water weight. If, at the end of your cut, you want to look more dry you can just cut out the creatine. Many people like to add some additional steady-state cardio a couple times a week just to speed up the process. I know that steady-state isn't necessarily the best choice if you want to lose fat, but it allows you to burn a few extra calories without adding significantly to your workload, so you'll not be friend in the gym all the time. And lastly, drink lots of water. If you keep your stomach full, even if it's just water, I find it "takes the edge off." Or of you like chewing gum, that's also a wonderful way to ignore the hunger pangs. 

I, for one, am of the opinion that any strength based activity (powerlifting, bodybuilding, weightlifting, strongman, etc) should not be done on an empty stomach, unless you're specifically cutting weight. So in your case a sturdy breakfast is important. Because I'm an American I will suggest something familiar to me, which is a bunch of eggs and a bunch of toast. Aside from the all-important pre-workout meal, the timing of your meals is largely unimportant. There are people that will tell you that there is a "window" post-workout where you have to consume something, however for your average gym goer this will not make a huge difference. The important thing is that you are eating the right amount of food. For "hardgainers" the common issue with gaining weight is their overestimation of the amount of food they're eating. 

It is likely that you are very new to lifting weights and your dominant arm is much stronger. It will always be the case, to varying degrees, that one limb is stronger than the other. So it is not something to be really worried about. I remember distinctly that my left arm was noticeably weaker in the bench press and overhead press when I was just starting. However this evened out with time, and I didn't do anything specific to address the issue. If you are not a novice and this is a sudden occurrence, it is time to worry and you should see a physician. 

There isn't something about you that makes you unique when compared with other strength athletes. If you eat more and train more you are going to progress. This sport isn't rocket science, so I think part of the problem is you are over thinking it. Pick a program with a lot of volume (Texas Method, Madcow, Smolov jr, etc) and stick to it. If you are stalling, and not gaining weight, try eating more. If you are stalling while gaining weight then things get tricky, and goes into much more depth than should be answered here. 

Like most things relating to strength training, it really depends on the person. I would say a good rule of thumb is to never skip a workout, regardless of physical/mental ailment. Often you will have to accommodate your physical/mental condition in your workout by decreasing the volume or intensity, but something relatively trivial as "I'm tired" isn't a great excuse. Save your skip days for days where it really counts. It also depends on the goals you have for your training. If you workout to maintain a healthy body, than skipping a day isn't going to kill you. But if you plan to compete in your chosen sport than I would seriously advise adhering to the Never Skip A Workout Ever approach as it helps contribute to a winning attitude. 

I've never competed in a cardio-based sport like biking. But I know in weightlifting you generally start to taper ~3weeks out from a competition. Since you lose your cardiovascular endurance much faster than your strength, I think the 2 weeks you have to play with is a reasonable time frame. I would cut out almost all the intensity and volume from your strength program. Stop adding weight now, and just do a 1x5 or a few 3s at a very comfortable weight (maybe %80?). You won't lose very much strength in 2 weeks because you're staying pretty active. And I would definitely leave 2 or 3 days between your last lifting session and the race. I won't really speak to your bike/cardio workouts just because I'm not familiar with that kind of training.
