Mr. Wizard has the jist of it but I thought I might add in what I have done. I cut a plastic straw (I use gas station straws that are pretty thick but McDonald's would work as well) to go from just below the head to about an inch past the first loop. then I wrapped the straw to the webbing with athletic tape. I then used a sharpie to color the tape the same color as the webbing so it's still easy to identify. I then took some more tape and wrapped it around the webbing just below the pin and then wrapped it over the pin and through the trough between the rails. The entire intention is to be able to place the pro one handed. The stiffer head makes it very easy to flick it one way or the other to change between active and passive placement. If you can place it one handed then you can spend more time getting it just right. Also, the additional wrapping on the head adds a bit of spring when placed as a cam which makes it easier to "activate" without yanking on it or yanking as hard, thus easier to remove. The major draw back to this is the rope will apply more upward pressure and can possible remove the placement so most people who do this connect a sling as well, to give the line more freedom of movement before affecting the placement. These are not pictures of mine but they look pretty close. The main differences being I colored my mid sections and I didn't come up as far with the tape, I only went right past the pin. 

I have heard that RMI (one of the places you listed) is great as well as Alpine Assents, but neither are very formal in the guide education area. Try taking a look at National Outdoor Leadership School. They have a pretty well setup program and work with some schools to get you credit (if you need it) They are pretty thorough and offer a 17 day course and a 31 day course. 

I probably wouldn't use regular epoxy. I have had trouble with it on rubber around water. When I am trying to reseal rubber I use silicone sealant or seal cement or Super under water epoxy. The seal cement is neoprene but it dries waterproof. Any one should work just fine it only depends on what you use the GPS for. Obviously the 3000 PSI rated epoxy that dries underwater would be the strongest but I would worry about it cracking or drying out if it is rarely or never under water. I usually have no problem with the silicone sealant for most things and use the seal cement on clothing only. 

I have used several different products and none of them work that well. Bottom line, is there a product that will subdue the offending groover? So a groover is a river toilet. On multiple day river trips you need to pack your solid waste out, liquid can usually go right into the river no problem depending on where you are (ask the local ranger). Originally it was an ammo can that you just dumped your solid waste in... directly. It was called a groover because when you were done and stood back up you had two grooves running down your backside (from the ammo can digging in). today we still use an ammo can to store it in, but we have a modern seat on it and a plastic inner container in the can. We also paint them white so they bake less in the hot river sun and smell (slightly) better. Also you know to not put anything in a white ammo can. Or open them on the river. I have used a couple of different products and have yet to be impressed. I am hoping for an answer of "I have used X and swear by it, it might not be perfect but it's leagues better than anything else" Ideally the product will also be allowed to be dumped in septic systems and not just sewer, but if not I will haul my solid waste back to civilization if I don't have to smell it. I have used Blue stuff (RV), bleach, kitty litter, and Pine Sol. 

Is there a way to make a wood fire that is good for cooking? Why is it better than others? Assume little to no wind. Would it make a difference if I cooking hot dogs on a stick or a steak? 

The supplies are pretty much the same for any trip. The leading difference, as Eyal points out, would be things like bear spray and a means to tie up food in bear bags at night. About bear bags, you want them high enough so you can't reach them and you want something on the line between the bag and the branch that will stop squirrels from climbing down the rope to the bag. We usually use an empty gallon milk jug for this (just cut a hole on opposite sides to put the rope through and wrap the rope around it once so it won't slide up and down under the weight of the squirrel). This depends entirely on your hiking ability. You say Day hikes so I usually take a Hydration pack with just essentials. Meaning a lunch, some snacks plenty of water. Depending on water availability I might take a water filter. A rain poncho, a map and compass, a pocket knife, a whistle and a small first aid kit always make it in though. This should all fit easily in a small hydration pack. Remember to secure what you leave behind and leaving it in your car is NOT secure. If you are going overnight then you could and would need to take considerably more. As far as day hikes go, again this depends on your ability as a hiker but I would look at Mount Washburn Trail which has a great view (and is the most popular hike in the park). Avalanche Peak is steep but only 4 miles round trip and again, amazing view. If you are going to be doing some overnights and you have been backpacking for a while, The Thorofare Trail IMO has no equal, easily one of my top 5 trips. Although, I was there before the fire last year, not sure what it looks like now. 

Safe? Yes. As in your life usually doesn't depend on them. Safe, as in a safe buy? Also yes. When looking at used climbing shoes it really helps if you take someone along who knows what to look for and/or knows the shoes themselves. If you know what they look like new then you know what they should look like. Specifically, check the seams and make sure they aren't coming apart. Especially the seam around the thickest part of rubber on the soles. If it looks like it starting to pull away at all stay away. Check the rubber on the bottom. If it has deep gouges or long cuts in it, then the previous owner probably didn't take care of them and might have even hiked in them. Often times you can find shoes in nearly new condition this way. Plenty of people make the mistake of buying everything and finding out they don't like rock-climbing, or picking shoes like they would any other shoes and have to bring them back because they don't fit right. I would highly recommend you try to find somewhere to rent the shoes and try them out first. Or go to an indoor gym and try them. For the fit, they should be sock tight (which is why I don't wear socks with them). Your first time wearing them, your feet should be in pain after climbing in them for an hour or two. For your first pair I recommend a mostly flat sole, for "all-around" use. They usually do alright in any situation and they are often times cheapest (not always). As you get more experience you will learn what you need. 

before reading any of this please remember safety first. If you are not comfortable with placement for any reason then you probably shouldn't be placing it there. NEVER sacrifice safety for convince. All suggestions here are for placement concerning removal NOT safety ,direction of pull or anything else. Also, there is no substitute for experience or an experienced teacher, in person, on the wall. Also, All suggestions are to be read with "Try... if you can." So "Don't put it too deep or out of reach of a tool" Becomes "Try not to put it too deep or out of reach of a tool if you can." 

The arrow points at the part of the rope you should pull. Pull it out until you have a big loop. Place the loop around your post or stake in the ground. Slide the Black piece of plastic up the rope until it is tight. Next try to turn the black piece of plastic perpendicular to the rope that goes to the tent. During this step the actual rope touching the peg/stake should shift slightly. If the rope is tight enough the black plastic will put a bit of a bend in the rope and hold tight. 

Currently I waterproof my tents at minimum once a year and often times 2 or 3 times a year. Other than condensation I don't usually have too much of a problem. On the other hand I live and often camp in one of the dryest places in the country so it rarely comes into play. My question is am I proofing it too often? Does anyone else actually bother with this stuff? 

I pack it like you do, and rarely ever have trouble. I think the important steps are what you do when you go to use it and what you use it for. First when I go to use it I remove the cross wrap completely. I hold it by the loop at the top or bottom. Once the cross wrap is undone I pull the mid section apart and lay it on the ground so it is in a complete circle. I don't touch the other end as much as possible. This is pretty easy when climbing but much harder during other activities. If I know I need some of the other end but will not need to touch it after that (like tying to an anchor or plugging in an extension cord) then I pull the amount I need out that side of the rope and then lay the circle of rope on the ground that side down. I will try to find a video or pics of this. Also, when coiling the rope up, if it's more than 100ft I use the "Backpackers" Coil (also know as a "butterfly" coil). I did a short Google search and this video came up that explained it exactly how I do it. If you are coiling anything by hand, and not using the behind the neck method, twist the rope as you coil it, it will coil and un-coil much easier. A simple half twist is usually all it needs which once you get in the habit you will find yourself doing with out realizing it as you coil anything. This Video does a good job of showing what I am talking about from seconds 22 to 32. I do not have sound so I have no idea what he is saying but the action is perfect. 

It sounds like you need a way to keep the entire shoe tight while not tight directly over the bend in your ankle. There are Lacing techniques that can accomplish this. The easiest would be to gap lace them with the gap in the spot where your ankle turns up. If this doesn't work I would also try the gap directly over the arch of the foot. If you want a different option you could also try segmented lacing which generally accomplishes the same thing but is a bit easier to do and deal with. 

I have been looking but unable to find a good video or step by step with photos to make my own Hammock. I have a ton of paracord lying around and plan on using that, but I'd really like a guide and/or to learn from someone else's mistakes before I start. 

Basically, if you can't patch them individually there are only 2 real options left. First, get a new tent. Every tent I have had has developed this over time unless used with a tarp underneath. Any roll on sealant that would work, would increase the weight about as much as a light weight tarp. Also, they tend to make the tent harder to roll up, and more annoying to deal with in general. Second, Replace the bottom tarp. If buying a new tent is too expensive, you can replace the bottom panel. I have done this in a few tents before. It is not fun and if you do this, make sure you seal the new seam and keep an eye on it the next time out. There are companies that will do it for a fee but it often costs close to what a new tent costs, unless your manufacturer does this. Manufacturers are usually much cheaper. As mentioned above, there are roll on sealant solutions, but in my experience they are not worth it. 

The other answers have great information. I would add some specifics that I have learned from living and backpacking all over Arizona and the white mountains for most of my life. Don't have everyone pee on the same rock/place at night. It will dry out and the salt can attract deer. If they get brought in to camp for the salt, they might smell something else and trample a tent or bag for it. Not so fun if you are the one in the tent, and mule deer are huge. Use a bear bag. It's not for the bears, it's for the rodents. Do NOT hang it from one tree. Try to hang it between two. Also tie a stick about a foot or two long into the rope just above the bag as it hangs from the line. This still won't stop all the squirrels. 

So I climb. It keeps my hands pretty rough, but for my day job I am a desk jockey now. I was wondering, are there exercises can I do to keep my hands rough so they don't get torn to shreds when I do get out? Is there anything I can do to keep them rough other than manual labor or climbing? 

I have heard different things from different people, but here in the South West we do a decent amount of desert hiking. Protection from bugs is usually little concern because most of the time in the summer day it is too hot for them. So mainly my question is what is cooler to hike in, all else being equal, short sleeves or long sleeves? Any real reason why?? 

This shoe is definitely not flat. It is "Aggressive" Aggressive $URL$ So visually that is the difference. An aggressive show can have a down turned sole like the one in the pic or it could just have a down pointed toe. Your Mileage may vary, but I have found the below to be true. Flat Sole: The basis against which all others are judged. Not really bad at anything. Good for smearing. Down turned Sole: Better for overhangs and roofs. Flat Toe: Better for foot and toe jams. Down pointed Toe: Good for Front pointing and Pocket Pulling as well as overhangs. 

The Ashley Book of Knots (published 1944) references the outside bowline as "inferior" but just says weakness nothing specific. In America the "outside" bowline is often called the "Dutch" bowline or Cowboy Bowline. So since, you ask, why is the bowline on Outdoor Stack Exchange tied with the end on the inside? because that is the classic bowline. End on the outside is a variant, like the Double Bowline, Water bowline, Yosemite Bowline, Bowline on a Bight, Spanish Bowline, or any of several others. The general problem with the Dutch bowline is if something grabs, pulls or catches the tail end while its on the outside the knot will come undone easier. Under a shifting load with nothing snagging the end, it will last roughly half as long. Also, the Dutch Bowline is prone to capsizing (basically coming undone) if the dangling outside end is pulled the wrong direction, again it could just snag on something while the knot itself is pulled in another direction. Please note, all of the above are arguments given by others. None of this has really been substantiated, but people will swear by it. I agree that there are several better knots to use in the example given, but addressing that wouldn't answer your question. Bottom line: The end outside is not a regular bowline. Ask a question here on how to tie a cowboy bowline or Dutch Bowline and you will get instructions with the end on the outside.
