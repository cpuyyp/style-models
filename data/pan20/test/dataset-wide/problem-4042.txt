Do I misunderstand something? Let $B$ be some small closed ball centered at $1$. Then $BF$ and $BG$ are closed neighborhoods of $F$ and $G$, respectively. Now, $K(BF)^{-1}\cap (BG)$ is a closed subset of $A=B((KB^{-2})F^{-1}\cap G)$; indeed, if $z=kb_1^{-1}f^{-1}=b_2g$, then $z=b_2\cdot k(b_1b_2)^{-1}f^{-1}=b_2g$. Since $KB^{-2}$ is compact, so is $A$ and hence any its close subset. 

Still, Pietro Majer is right --- there is no such $R_0$. Let $S$ be the convex hull of the unit circle centered at the origin and the point $A=(2R-1,0)$. Then it is $R$-fat, with the unit disk inside it and the smallest enclosing disk with radius $R$ and center $(R-1,0)$. Now assume that $S$ is cut into two convex sets $T$ and $T'$, with $T$ containing $A$. Let $O$ and $r$ be the center and the radius of a largest disk $D$ contained in $T$ (we have $r<1$, otherwise $T=S$). Then the abscissa of $O$ is at most $(2R-1)(1-r)$. Now, $T$ contains the point $B$ on the ray $AO$ with $AB=AO+r\geq (2R-1)r+r=2Rr$. Notice that $B$ lies strictly inside $S$; since the cut is straight and $B$ lies on the boundary of $D$, $T$ also contains some other point $C$ on the line perpendicular to $AB$ and passing through $B$. Then $AC>AB=2Rr$, so the smallest disr enclosing $T$ has the radius greater than $Rr$, and $T$ is not $R$-fat. REMARK, edited. Notice that in this example, one may still cut $S$ into two $R$-fat non-convex but simply connected sets by a non-straight cut (namely, by a circular arc). As Erel mentions in the comment, this is always possible for every $R>1$. 

Every vertex removed from the $k$th layer prohibits $k!(n-k)!\leq (n-1)!$ paths. Thus, if $n$ removed verices prohibit all $n!$ paths, then each of them prohibits exactly $(n-1)!$ paths, and the sets of prohibited paths are disjoint. This means that either all the vertices are on the first layer, or all the vertices are on the $(n-1)$th layer. In both cases their removal disconnects the unoriented graph as well. 

Consider the $n$-dimensional affine space over a finite field with $q$ elements ($n\geq 2$ for connectivity reasons). Let $P$ be the set of points in it, $L$ be the set of lines, and $G_n$ be the bipartite graph of incidence of $P$ and $L$. Then any two points are connected with a path of length 2, so the diameter of the graph is 4, and it has $q^n+\frac{q^{n-1}(q^n-1)}{q-1}$ vertices. On the other hand, if you embed this graph in a way you did with the complete bipartite graph, then $\mathop{ker}$ will be the smallest size of the dominating set $D$ which should have at least $\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$ elements (this estimate is not sharp). Indeed, if $D$ contains all the points then it contains even at least $q^n$ vertices. Otherwise, take any point $p$ which is not in $D$ and consider all the $\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$ lines passing through it. Each of them should either be in $D$, or contain a point from $D$, and all these points should be distinct. 

In a beautiful paper A. Hajnal obtained the following Lemma. Lemma. Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices containing no $(k+1)$-clique. Then all $k$-cliques in $G$ have at least $2k-n$ common vertices. This yields that $G$ should contain at least $2N$ vertices, otherwise the $H_i$ have a common vertex. On the other hand, a complete graph on $2N$ vertices with a perfect matching removed contains no $(N+1)$-clique, but it contains $2^{N-1}$ pairwise intersecting cliques of size $N$. So, if $3\leq k\leq 2^{N-1}$, then the answer is $2N$. 

Take a complete graph $K_d$. For every its vertex $u$, take $d$ more vertices connected just to $u$. We get $d(d+1)$ vertices in total. Every minimal vertex cover contains all but one vertices of $K_d$. Either it contain all of them (and then it contains just $d$ vertices), or it does not contain some $u$ --- then it should contain $d$ extra vertices connected just to $u$. Thus it contains at most $2d-1$ vertices, which is $\Theta(2\sqrt{d(d+1)}$. Perhaps, this bound is tight? Surely, we need at least $O(\sqrt n)$ vertices. Indeed, assume that the cover contains $o(\sqrt n)$ vertices; the complement of the cover is an independent set of $n-o(\sqrt n)$ vertices, so it contains $O(\sqrt n)$ vertices connected to one vertex $v$ from the cover. Then any minimal subcover in $V\setminus\{v\}$ contains at least $O(\sqrt n)$ vertices. 

If $\mathcal V$ spans $\mathbb F_2^m$, it should contain a basis of $\mathbb F_2^m$; so we may assume that $\mathcal V$ contains ony this basis, and $a=m$. In this case, if $e_i$ is not expressible via $m-1$ vectors from $\mathcal V$, this means exactly that $e_i=v_1+\dots+v_m$. This may happen only for one of the $e_i$; so $b=a-1$ is impossible for $m>1$. On the other hand, $b=a-2$ is always realizable (if $m>1$, surely). Indeed, set $$ A=\begin{pmatrix} 0& 1& 1& \cdots& 1& 1\\ 1& 0& 1& \cdots& 1& 1\\ 1& 1& 0& \cdots& 1& 1\\ \vdots& \vdots& \vdots& \ddots& \vdots& \vdots\\ 1& 1& 1& \cdots& 0& 1\\ 1& 1& 1& \cdots& 1& 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ (the last row looks a bit different). It is easily seen that $A$ is non-degenerate; so we may find a basis $\{v_1,\dots,v_m\}$ such that $$ (e_1,\dots,e_m)=(v_1,\dots,v_m)A. $$ This basis constitutes the required set. 

In general: if $u,v\in V$ are such that $f(u)\neq f(v)$ for all $f\in F=\mathop{\mathrm{Hom}}(G,G)$ then we may add to $E'$ the edge $(u,v)$ along with all its homomorphic images. So $E'$ is merely the set of all such edges $(u,v)$. Specifically, for a chain $a-b-c-d$ the vertices $a$ and $d$ can never map to one vertex. Thus $(a,d)$ will be in $E'$. A bit more generally, it seems that for a bipartite connected graph $G$ with parts $A$ and $B$ the set $E'$ will consist of all edges between $A$ and $B$. 

Let $a=\chi(G)\geq 3$ and $b=\chi'(G)$. Paint the vertices in $a$ colors and edges in $b$ colors properly. Now choose one color class of edges. Repaint each of them into one of the first $a$ colors, distinct from the two colors of the edge's endpoints. Since the repainted edges were pairwise non-adjacent,we get a proper total coloring in $a+b-1$ colors. 

Here are several elementar examples; I do not know whether they count? From Number theory: the ring of Gaussian integers is Euclidean, because the distance from any point inside a square to one of its vertices is less than its side length. A similar reasoning may be applied to several other rings. From Linear Algebra. Cramer's rule is in fact quite geometrical! Basically, it says that if you need to expand a vector $\mathbf b$ in a base $\mathbf a_1,\dots,\mathbf a_n$, then the coefficienf of $\mathbf a_i$ is the ratio of distances from $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf a_i$ to the hyperplane spanned by the other base vectors, i.e., the ratio of volumes $$ \frac{V(\mathbf a_1,\dots,\mathbf a_{i-1},\mathbf b,\mathbf a_{i+1},\dots,\mathbf a_n)} {V(\mathbf a_1,\dots,\mathbf a_n)}. $$ 

The answer is no. Take a chain $a_1>\dots>a_{100}$ and add two elements $b>a_{51}$ and $c<a_{50}$ (with no relations not implied by these ones). The maximum of $f(\mathcal C)$ is achieved on the decomposition $\{a_1,\dots,a_{100}\}\sqcup\{b\}\sqcup\{c\}$, while the maximal antichain has cardinality 2 (due to the decomposition into two chains $\{a_1,\dots,a_{50},c\}\sqcup \{b,a_{51},\dots,a_{100}\}$). 

Here is a different approach, also using a theorem; I do not know if it is elementary in your view. Let $A$ be a set of $n$ vertices, and let $B_1,\dots,B_{n-1}$ be its subsets. Introduce $n$ variables $x_a$ ($a\in A$) and consider a system of $n-1$ linear equations of the form $\sum_{a\in B_i} x_a=0$. It has a nonzero solution $(x^0_a)_{a\in A}$. Now paint all the vertices $a:x_a^0>0$ in red, and $a:x_a^0<0$ in blue; you are done. Right now I do not understand how to extend this argument for $k$-coloring... 

Surely, it is worth assuming $\max(\deg p,\deg q)>1$ (and $\deg q\geq \deg p$). In this case, there is no hope for $H$ to be finite or discrete. Take any positive integer $n$ and any nonzero rational $r$. Let $h$ be a root of $G_{r,n}(x)=p(rx^{2n})+xq(rx^{2n})$ (this polynomial is of odd degree!). Then $h\in H$, since $x-rh^{2n}\mid F_h(x)$. Fixing $n$ and varying $r$, you get that $H$ is dense in the set of value of $(-p/q)$. Moreover, I would expect the polynomial $G_{r,n}(x)$ to be irreducible infinitely often; in this case $h$ can have arbitrarily high degree. 

Since $F$ is irreducible, after a suitable rotation (not affecting the condition on $\max(|x|,|y|)$ too much) we have $$ F(x,y)=\alpha\prod_{i=1}^d(x-c_iy), $$ where $c_i$ are distinct complex numbers. Now, for every $y$ with $|y|=a>B^{1/d}\log^\delta B$, if $(x,y)\in A_F(B,\delta)$ then $|x-c_iy|\leq B^{1/d}$ for some $i$. Then for all $j\neq i$ we have $$ |x-c_iy|+|c_iy-c_jy|\geq |x-c_jy|\geq |c_iy-c_jy|-|x-c_iy|, $$ so $$ |x-c_jy|=(1+o(1))|c_j-c_i|a. $$ Therefore, our $x$ satisfies the condition iff $|x-c_iy|\leq \mu Ba^{1-d}$ for some constant $\mu$. Thus, on the line with this fixed $y$-coodrinate $A_F(B,\delta)$ has some (say, $k$) segments, corresponding to all real $c_i$, each segment of length $(1+o(1))2\mu Ba^{1-d}$. Integrating over $a$, we get $$ \sim 2k\cdot 2\mu B\int_{B^{1/d}\log^\delta B}^{+\infty}\frac{da}{a^{d-1}} =\frac{4k\mu B}{(d-2)B^{1-2/d}\log^{\delta(d-2)}B} =\frac{4k\mu}{d-2}\frac{B^{2/d}}{\log^{\delta(d-2)}B}. $$ This is an estimate for the part of $A_F(B,\delta)$ with large $|y|$. The same estimate works for large $|x|$. Thus $A_F(B,\delta)=\Theta_F(B^{2/d}/\log^{\delta(d-2)}B)$. 

Denote $\Delta^{ij}(m,k)=d^{ij}(m,k)-d^{ji}(m,k)$. By reverting the permutation we observe that $d^{ij}(m,k)=d^{ji}(m,{m\choose 2}-k)$, so $$ \Delta^{ij}(m,k)=-\Delta^{ij}(m,{m\choose 2}-k). \qquad (*) $$ Now we prove the statement by the induction on $m$. Firstly, we present the step, and then we establish the base case (which is $i=1$, $j=m$). For the step from $m$ to $m+1$, assume that $j\leq m$ and $k<{m+1\choose 2}$. Take any permutation counted in $d^{ij}(m+1,k)$ and remove the number $m+1$ (say, from the $(m+1-t)$th position); the number of inversions decreases by $t$. Thus, $$ d^{ij}(m+1,k)=d^{ij}(m,k)+d^{ij}(m,k-1)+\dots+d^{ij}(m,k-m). $$ Similarly, we write the formula for $d^{ji}(m+1,k)$; this gives us $$ \Delta^{ij}(m+1,k)=\Delta^{ij}(m,k)+\Delta^{ij}(m,k-1)+\dots+\Delta^{ij}(m,k-m). $$ If $k\leq {m\choose 2}$, then the induction hypothesis immediately yields $\Delta^{ij}(m+1,k)>0$. Otherwise, several first terms cancel due to $(*)$, but there are still some remaining terms, and they are positive in view of the induction hypothesis again. If $j=m+1$ but $i>1$, then we may similarly remove $1$ from the permutation. So we are left with the base case only. Denote by $n(m,k)$ the total number of permutations on $m$ elements with $k$ inversions. Now, if we remove $i=1$ and $j=m$ from the permutations counted in $d^{1m}(m,k)$ and $d^{m1}(m,k)$, the number of inversions reduces controllably, provided that the positions of $i$ and $j$ are known. Indeed, if $I$ and $J$ are their positions, then the number of inversions reduces by $(I-1)+(m-J)$ (if $I<J$) and by $(I-1)+(m-J)+1$ otherwise. This way, we obtain $$ d^{1m}(m,k)=n(m-2,k)+2n(m-2,k-1)+\dots+(m-1)n(m-2,k-(m-2)) $$ and $$ d^{m1}(m,k)=n(m-2,k-(2m-3))+2n(m-2,k-(2m-2))+\dots+(m-1)n(m-2,k-(m-1)). $$ Now the inequality $\Delta^{1m}(m,k)>0$ follows from the unimodularity (and symmetry) of the sequence $n(m-2,0), n(m-2,1),\dots,n(m-2,{m-2\choose 2})$. This unimodularity can be proved similarly to our step above (and, as I assume, is well-known). 

$\let\eps\varepsilon$Assume that for all $n>N$ the number $an!+1$ is prime. To start, take any odd $k>2a$ and set $S=k!+a$. Then the number $S/a-1=k!/a$ is divisible by all primes not exceeding $k$. Thus $S/a$ is divisible by some prime $p>k$. Now we have $$ a(p-k-1)!+1=\frac{a(p-1)!}{(p-1)\dots(p-k)}+1 \equiv \frac{-a}{-k!}+1=\frac{a+k!}{k!}\equiv 0\pmod p. $$ If we choose $k$ so that $p-k-1>N$ and $a(p-k-1)!+1>p$, we get a contradiction. The first goal is easily achievable since there are infinitely many $k$ such that all the numbers $k+1.k+2.\dots,k+N,k+N+1$ are composite; moreover, there is an infinite arithmetical progression of such $k$. Assume that for every such $k$ we have $a(p-1-k)!+1=p$. We have $p=k+o(k)$ (otherwise $p-k\geq \eps k$ for infinitely many $k$, so $p-k\geq \frac{\eps}{1+\eps}p$, and $a(p-1-k)!+1$ is much greater than $p$), So there are two distinct $k$ providing the same value of $p-k-1$. This is absurd, since then we have $p_1=a(p_1-k_1-1)!+1=a(p_2-k_2-1)!+1=p_2$ and hence $k_1=p_1-1-(p_1-k_1-1)=p_2-1-(p_2-k_2-1)=k_2$. 

For any point $a\in S$, there is an infinite (in both directions) chain $\dots,a_{-1},a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots$ of points such that $d(a_i,a_{i+1})=1$, and no other points are at distance $1$ from the points of this chain. The whole circle is partitioned into (continuum of) such chains; for every chain we choose its representative $a_0$. Now find a bijection between the set of all chains and the set of all infinite strictly increasing sequences $(n_1,n_2,\dots)$ of positive integers. If a coset with representative $a_0$ corresponds to a sequence $(n_1,n_2,\dots)$, we put into $D$ the elements $a_0,a_{n_1},a_{n_1+n_2},\dots$. Perform this operation for all chains. Now, if $\phi$ is 1-iso and $\phi(D)=D$, then $\phi$ maps $\{a_0,a_{n_1},a_{n_1+n_2},\dots\}$ to either $\{b_i,b_{i+n_1},b_{i+n_1+n_2},\dots\}$ or $\{b_i,b_{i-n_1},b_{i-n_1-n_2},\dots\}$, and this image should equal to $D\cap (\dots,b_{-1},b_0,b_1,\dots\}$. The second set cannot lie in $D$, while the first may equal $D\cap (\dots,b_{-1},b_0,b_1,\dots\}$ only if $b_0=a_0$. Thus $\phi$ is the identity map. 

[EDIT] This is an affirmative answer to the original question, with $C=2$. The negative answer to the version where $1/2$ is replaced by a smaller constant is kept below. For every $\mathbf x\in[0,1]^k$, we define $\mathbf a(\mathbf x)\in\{0,1\}^k$ by $a(x)_i=0\iff x_i\leq 1/2$. Now, assume that $A(\mathbf x^1),\dots,A(\mathbf x^n)$ are disjoint and $N>2^k$; then there are $\mathbf x=\mathbf x^i$ and $\mathbf z=\mathbf x^j$ with $i\neq j$ but $\mathbf a(\mathbf x)=\mathbf a(\mathbf z)=\mathbf a$. Now define $\mathbf y\in[0,1]^k$ as follows: If $a_i=0$ then $y_i=x_i(\leq 1/2)$, otherwise $y_i=z_i(>1/2)$. Then $\mathbf y\in A(\mathbf x)$ due to the following system of segments: $I_i=[x_i,x_i]$ if $a_i=0$, and $I_i=[1/2,1]$ otherwise. Similarly, $\mathbf y\in A(\mathbf z)$ due to the following system of segments: $I_i=[0,1/2]$ if $a_i=0$, and $I_i=[z_i,z_i]$ otherwise. Thus $A(\mathbf x)\cap A(\mathbf z)\neq\varnothing$ --- a contradiction. Thus $C=2$ fits. 

$\let\eps\varepsilon$Yes, that's true, and the argument is somewhat similar to that for your previous question. Surely, completeness is not needed, since you wish to obtain a Cauchy sequence, not a convergent one. Denote $d_i=d(x_i,x_{i+1})$. Applying the condition for $\eps=d_i$, we get that $d_i$ strictly decrease, so there exists $D=\lim_{i\to\infty} d_i$. If $D>0$, we get a contradiction by setting $\eps=D$; so $D=0$. Now let us show that for every $\eps>0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $k\geq n>N$ we have $d(x_k,x_n)<2\eps$; this is exactly what we need. Choose $\delta$ for our $\eps$ from the condition; we may assume that $\delta<\eps$. There exists $N$ such that $d_n<\delta$ for all $n>N$. We claim that this $N$ fits. Indeed, let us show that for all $k\geq n>N$ we have $d(x_k,x_n)<\eps+\delta$; this is clearly sufficient. Induction on $k$. If $k=n$ then there is nothing to prove. Assume now that $k>n$. [ADDED] By the induction hypothesis, we have $d(x_{k-1},x_n)<\eps+\delta$. Now consider the following two cases.[/ADDED] If $d(x_{k-1},x_n)<\eps$ then $$ d(x_k,x_n)\leq d_{k-1}+d(x_{k-1},x_n)<\delta+\eps. $$ Otherwise, we have $\eps \leq d(x_{k-1},x_n)<\eps+\delta$, so by the condition $d(x_k,x_{n+1})<\eps$, and $$ d(x_k,x_n)\leq d(x_k,x_{n+1})+d_n\leq \eps+\delta. $$ The claim is proved.
