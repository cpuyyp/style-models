Blichfeldt's paper below contains the result that G has an abelian, normal, Hall π-subgroup for π a collection of primes p > (n-1)(2n+1). This was refined to: 

You asked a lot about the F–S indicator. I'll answer part of it for now, so that there is a smaller piece to answer later. Your first division algebra question makes more sense in a slightly different context: if T is an irreducible real representation of G (an irreducible ℝG-module), then three cases occur: EndℝG(T) = ℝ is real, = ℂ is complex, or = ℍ is quaternionic. In the first case T is also irreducible over the complexes and its Schur indicator is +1. In the second case T is not irreducible over the complexes, but is instead the sum of two complex conjugate representations, both of whose Schur indicators are 0. In the third case, the representation "ramifies" when extended to the complexes, and you get the sum of two isomorphic representations (both of) whose Schur indicator is -1. I like to think of this in terms of complex endomorphism rings, but then it no longer specifically mentions the quaternions: EndℂG(T) = ℂ is complex when the Schur indicator is +1, = ℂ×ℂ when the Schur indicator (of the summands) is +0, = M2(ℂ) when the Schur indicator (of the summand) is -1. These correspond to applying –⊗ℝℂ to the reals, complexes, and quaternions. Your numerical invariant of the division algebra is probably best understood as a quest for the "Brauer group" of F. There is a very well-defined and reasonably well-understood theory for this. That is usually phrased in terms of "central simple algebras", but it turns out to mostly be a matter of notation. For F a p-adic field, then yes, you mostly just get a number, but for a general field it is a little bit of a stretch (but not insane) to say you get a number. On the off chance someone is interested, this is one of the places where the Schur index is easily understood. If the Schur indicator is +1, then the field of values and the splitting field are equal to the reals. If the Schur indicator is 0, then the field of values and the splitting field are equal to the complexes. If the Schur indicator is -1, then the field of values is the reals, but the splitting field is degree 2 (the complexes), so the Schur index is 2. This is also the smallest multiple of the character that has a representation realizable over the field of values, and so this is is why in the -1 case, T splits into two (self-conjugate) copies of itself. In terms of blocks of the group ring, this block is a matrix ring over the quaternion algebra, and it contains many copies of the irreducible. Each copy of the irreducible has a centralizer isomorphic to the complexes, a splitting field of the block and the irreducible. Edit: A gentle book for character theory is G. James and M. Liebeck's Representations and Characters of Groups. Its chapter 23 is entirely to devoted to all of these different ideas (as well as Frobenius's original motivation) without using anything fancy. It has many examples, many exercises, and solutions to many exercises. I think it is useful for both group theorists and people who just want to use representations. For fancier things: I. Reiner's Maximal Orders has nice coverage of the division algebras associated to finite group algebras (and their maximal orders). My favorite textbook treatment of the numerical invariant of the division algebras are Albert's Modern Higher Algebra and Structure of Algebras, but some people think they are old fashioned. Recent treatments will often get lost in technicalities that are irrelevant to group algebras. You might be OK with one of large textbooks on algebra; many have a chapter on Central Simple Algebras and the Brauer Group. MathOverflow readers will probably like Rowen's Algebra: A Non-commutative View. 

It does however appear to be a bit rare. The simple groups I've checked other than A5 all have all signatures less than 1. I didn't see any simple groups satisfying the hypothesis of (2), so I guess it could be vacuously true. 

This example is not particularly satisfying since it is just the direct product S3×k. For the verification, check that (b3)a = b(3k2+3) = b3 since 3 ≡ 3k2+3 mod 3k, but (bk)a = bk(k2+1) = (bk)2 since 2 ≡ k2+1 mod 3. This might make a good example to show that "a" and "b" are not uniquely defined by the abstract isomorphism type of the group meeting your requirements (since the "k" could just as easily have been part of the "a" as part of the "b"). Unfortunately you cannot do much better than this using the first direction, since if ⟨a⟩ centralizes a subgroup of ⟨b⟩ of prime order p, then ⟨a⟩ centralizes the entire Sylow p-subgroup of ⟨b⟩, and you get a direct product. This follows from your coprime hypothesis. The other direction looks a bit different. Take any example semi-direct product ⟨A,b⟩ that has ⟨b⟩ normal, |A| and |b| are coprime, and Z(⟨A,b⟩) a proper subgroup. Let ⟨a⟩ be a cyclic group of order k|A| where k is coprime to ⟨b⟩, and define ba = bA. Then the center of ⟨a,b⟩ is still a proper subgroup and contains ⟨a|A|⟩ of order k. More concretely: 

Yes. I believe (ab)^3 or so, at least (ab)^n for high enough n, never terminates. As far as I recall, only (ab)^1 and (ab)^2 terminate. If you start to collect them, I think you'll see the proof. 

Berkovich and Zhmud also pose an exercise that if all the irreducible characters of degree coprime to p take on only 3 values, then the group is p-solvable. The same is true if "coprime to" is replaced by "divisible by". This is page 238. 

By Brauer's permutation lemma, the permutation characters are always equal, but the representations need not be isomorphic. For instance, the non-abelian group of order 27 and exponent 9 provides an example. One condition for an equivalence for subgroups of the automorphism group is given in Isaacs's Character Theory textbook as theorem 13.24 on page 230–231: 

Edit: Just to be fickle, let me mention another open problem in that intersection of finite simple groups and number theory. Solomon (2001) attributes this to Peter Neumann: 

Primitive groups can be studied by the way the group acts on its socle in many cases, indeed it is common (in those cases) to view the socle as the set of points which the primitive permutation group is permuting. Perfect and p-groups suddenly have a new socle, so they are not commonly studied by looking at the new socle (at the bottom), but rather by looking at their tops. In particular, I think you'll find looking at the bottoms of p-groups much harder than looking at the tops. 

I'm looking for a few more examples of using Aschbacher (1980)'s “fundamental SL2 subgroups” description of Sylow 2-subgroups of finite groups of Lie type in odd characteristic. I do not yet understand his original paper, nor the (brief) discussion in GLS (1998), but the use in Harada–Lang (2005) was very compelling. Can anyone recommend other papers or presentations that might make the description more clear? 

Amongst the finitely generated abelian groups, those with commutative endomorphism ring are exactly the cyclic groups. Torsion abelian groups with commutative endomorphism rings are exactly the locally cyclic groups, that is, the subgroups of Q/Z. They were classified in: 

I am of course still curious about 2′. I think an answer to 1″ would both provide an answer for 2′ and be enough, even without an explicit reference, to finish Robin Chapman's answer to 1. 

I believe the holomorph of the elementary abelian group of order 2n is complete unless n=1 or 3. It is called AGL(n,2), the affine general linear group of dimension n over the field of size 2. In other words, n=4 isn't the exception, but rather the rule. GL(3,2) is all sorts of weird, and I guess GL(1,2) is just too small. The holomorph of 4×4×2×2 is also complete. There are no other (non-elementary) abelian groups of order dividing 32 whose holomorph is complete. 

Some of what you asked for might be more along the lines of asking if the permutation groups generated by gensIrr and gensCcl are conjugate, so I chose an example where even the images are not conjugate. The example given below of G=2×2×2 is the smallest if you only want strict permutation (non-)isomorphism.
