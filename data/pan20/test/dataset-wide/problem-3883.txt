As noted by Lucia, large parts of number theory are completely "beyond the scope of the Langlands program": most of analytic number theory, obviously, is, but also many important, active and beautiful subfields of algebraic number theory -- for a list of examples, see for instance the list of publications of Bjorn Poonen, which cover a large scope of subjects in algebraic number theory, but touch the Langlands program only tangentially. To make sense of the proposed quote of Mochizuki, it is therefore necessary to give a much more restrictive interpretation of "number theory", which I imagine would be in this context the set of number-theoretic questions that can be solved or at least attacked by understanding the Galois groups of number fields, together with all its attached tractors of decomposition groups, inertia subgroups, and Frobenius elements. This set contains all the reciprocity laws, proved or conjectured, and many diophantine equations and problems, from Fermat's last theorem to Mordell's conjecture and its generalizations, through Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. My guess is that Mochizuki means that even in this relatively restricted sense, many phenomenons of number theory lie beyond the scope of Langlands. In saying so, he is following an idea that Grothendieck tried to disseminate in the 80's ("avec force", as Deligne said), which I will try to summarize as follows. The Langlands program tries to understand Galois groups by looking at their representations, that is, their action over vector spaces over fields or slightly more generally over modules over commutative rings. At any rate, these objects form an abelian category (even Tannakian), a linear object. Grothendieck's theory of Motives should be attached to this general program, because the motives also are "linear objects", and as Langlands himself famously argued in his famous 1979 paper "Automorphic Representations, Shimura Varieties, and Motives. Ein Märchen". But, Grothendieck argues, there are many other kind of objects on which we may let Galois group act in order to study them in a different direction than with representations: sets, for instance, as in the version of Galois theory developed in SGA 1 (1960), or non-abelian (profinite) groups, as the étale fundamental groups of various variety over $\mathbb Q$: to this aspect belong all the theory of Grothendieck-Teichmüller, the Dessins d'enfants, the anabelian geometry. That is of course a subject in which Mochizuki has himself proved some remarkable results, and which he claims to have enormously developed up to the point of deducing the ABC conjecture. An example of a number theoretic (in the restricted sense mentioned above) problem that arguably lies beyond the Langlands program but that the practicians of anabelian geometry plans to study successfully is Mordell's conjecture (proved by Faltings, it is true, with methods not so far from the Langlands program, at least in that they study "linear objects", namely abelian varieties) and all its generalizations (still open). For a very interesting, if speculative, discussion of these questions, see "Galois Theory and Diophantine Geometry" by Minhyong Kim. 

To give a positive result, let me say that the answer to the second question is positive when $f$ is an eigenform for almost all Hecke operators (or even infinitely many, that's enough.) 

There are already 8 good answers to this old question, but surprisingly there is something which I believe is true and important and that none of the answers says explicitly: Understanding Gal$(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)$ as a group is not a major goal of number theory, and actually is not even a problem that really belongs to number theory. This is not to say this problem is not interesting. But it is a problem that belongs to algebra, field theory if you like, not to number theory. For example, the conjecture of Shafarevich mentioned by JSE (that's a natural subgroup of tat group is free profinite), while interesting, is not really number theory. What number theory is concerned about is understanding Gal$(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)$, together with its family of subgroups $D_p$ (for $p$ a prime or infinity), the decomposition groups well defined up to conjugacy, and isomorphic to Gal$(\overline{\mathbb Q}_p/\mathbb Q_p)$ for $p$ finite, and to $\mathbb Z/2$ when $p=\infty$. I think that this what most people mean, but sometimes forget to say, when they say that understanding is a major goal of Number Theory. Indeed, if we "understand" sufficiently well Gal$(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)$ with its decomposition subgroup, we understand in principle a lot of finite Galois groups which can be obtained with elementary operations from the above, and that can be interpreted say as various class groups of number fields. In turn those groups governs a lot of classical problems in number theory, like classifying quadratic forms over $\mathbb Z$ (a problem considered since Legendre), understanding which prime can be represented by a give quadratic forms, understanding all kind of Selmer groups, etc. 

To develop a point already mentioned: To some extent algebraic geometry, including complex algebraic geometry, is a part of number theory. The reason for this is that any algebraic variety, say over $\mathbb{C}$, is defined by polynomial equations involving only finitely many coefficients, so the coefficients live in a ring which is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $A$, and $A$ belongs to the domain of number theory. For example, if $m$ is a maximal ideal of $A$, then $A/m$ is a finite field, and the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$ is $(0)$, so studying "varieties" over $A$ can be reduced in principle to studying varieties over finite fields. Applications of this method to prove results in complex algebraic geometry by means of number-theoretic methods are many. For a few, relatively elementary but still striking, examples (including the theorem of Ax-Grothendieck and the existence of a fixed point for a $p$-group acting algebraically on $\mathbb{C}^n$), see e.g. this survey paper of Serre. For a more advanced example, consider the beautiful theorem of Batyrev, that birational Calabi-Yau $n$-folds have equal Betti numbers, which is proved by reducing the question to a question over finite field solved using Deligne's proof of the (last) Weil's conjecture, one of the jewel of modern algebraic number theory. 

Knowing the organizers well and working in the field, I can try an answer, but this is nothing more than an educated guess. First, the breakthroughs in question include (i) The construction and study of Galois representations attached to self-dual cohomological automorphic forms for $Gl_n$ (satisfying local-global compatibility, etc.) This is the work of many people, based on the fundamental work of Arthur and Ngo, including Shin, Morel, Harris, Clozel, Labesse, and many many others. This can be considered as done, even if the four-volume Paris' book edited by Harris that should contain every detail is not completely ready. (ii) The construction and study of Galois representations attached to not necessary self-dual cohomological automorphic forms for $Gl_n$, announced last year by Lan, Harris, Taylor and Thorne (the preprint has yet to be released). (iii) The proof by Kisin and also by Emerton of large parts of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture for $Gl_2$. (iv) The proof of Sato-Tate by many people with various multiplicity, the two highest being Taylor and Harris. (v) The progresses on the p-adic Langlands program, especially on the Breuil-Mezard conjecture. (vi) The progress on the theory of Shimura varieties, including the proof of two major conjectures of the subject by Kisin (one has an older, not universally accepted, proof by Vas): the conjectures of Milne and of Langlands-Rapoport. At first I thought I should include (0) the proof of the fundamental lemma by Ngo, but since none of the organizers is a specialist of this area, I am not sure. Now why the emphasis on the "geometric methods", and what are those? Well, there is a même saying that along the traditional tripartite division of mathematicians as "algebraists", "analysts", and "geometers" (see e.g. Recoltes et Semailles), while people like Breuil (or Fontaine) are more on the algebraic side, and perhaps Colmez on the analytic side, people like Kisin and Emerton are really on the geometric side, and that their geometric intuition played a crucial role in their recent successes. Whatever you think of this même (or even of the tripartite classification) it is quite possible that it made its way to the mind of one or more of the organizer. The geometric insights and methods include (a) the use of "eigenvarieties": families of automorphic or/and Galois representations that have a geometric structure, and whose geometric properties, local and global illuminate the properties of the individual objects that compose them. For example, this plays a crucial role in Emerton's proof of Fonntaine-Mazur's conjecture (iii), in constructing Galois representations by "passage to the limit" (i) and (ii), and also in recent progress toward Bloch-Kato and Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (work of Chenevier and myself, Urban and Skinner), and also in the work on the Breuil-Mezard conjecture (Kisin first, then others) (b) The better understanding of certain Shimura varieties, in particular the ones attached to unitary groups, in particular in connection with Rapoport-Zink spaces etc. For example one can cite the thesis work of Mantovan, which is used in Shin's subsequent work on (i). Also whatever Kisin uses to prove the conjecture about Shimura variety (at this point I don't know what it is, but I am organizing a seminar at Yale to learn this eventually) (c) Also, the better understanding and the use of the boundary components of non-compact Shimura varieties, including in cases (this is mainly speculative so far) where this components has only the structure of a differentiable manifold, not of an algebraic variety. I am not sure, but idea like that plays a role in (iv). (d) Study of cycle on Shimura's varieties, in particular in connection to periods and p-adic L-function (how to define them in higher ranks? that is very hard and important). (e) if (0) is included (which as I have said, I am not sure of), the geometric methods of Ngo (and before him Laumon, Goreski, MacPherson: balloons, Hitchin's vibrations, etc.) used in proving the fundamental lemma, and perhaps also the ones of Laurent Lafforgue. But I think this might be the subject of another conference. I hope that helps... Sorry to anyone I forgot to mention, my list of people having a part in the recent breakthroughs is far from complete. 

The answer is no (even in case 2). Typically if you take a proper and smooth relative surface $X$ over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, and you blow up a point at some point of the special fiber of $X$, the resulting scheme $Y$ will still be proper and smooth with same generic fiber, but the special fiber may have changed. Edit: Oops, Ulrich is write, the example is incorrect. Sorry. 

Atiyah and Singer proved their famous "index theorem" in topology using ideas and methods directly inspired by Grothendieck's proof of his huge generalization of Riemann-Roch's theorem, a proof that makes a prototypical use of several of the newest aspects of modern (that is Grothendieck's) algebraic geometry, for example the insistence in working in a relative rather than absolute situation, that is for morphisms rather than simply for objects. 

The answer depends what kind of "cover" you need down the road. For a strong definition of cover, like a "Zariski cover", the answer is no in general. I believe it is still no for an "étale cover" or "fpqc cover". Now if you ready to consider as covers not only Zariski covers but any proper and birational map $X' \rightarrow X$, then the answer is yes in full generality, and for general reasons which have not much to do with eigenvarieties. See Lemma 3.4.2 in my book with Chenevier (Astérisque 324) and how it is used in the proof of Theorem 3.4.1. (I can give more details if needed). 

The question is not precise enough to get a definite answer, but not for the reason most people say in commentaries. The problem does not lie in the ambiguous meaning of "consistent" (which just means "free of contradictions", which was as clear then as now), but in the meaning of "way of arguing". What we do have is a corpus of results from the founders of calculus (say Pascal, Descartes, Fermat, Newton, Leibniz), and a corpus of arguments they used to justify them. The corpus of results is certainly a corpus of true results, so is consistent, and was certainly recognized as such even by Berkeley (to my knowledge, the first serious contradiction involving results of calculus came 150 years after the founding period with Cauchy's theorem that a limit of continuous functions is continuous, combined with counter-examples from Fourier's theory, so is completely out of our scope). Now is the corpus of arguments used by our fathers "consistent"? This question does not make real sense, because "arguments" are not results, and are not "true or false", either individually or in groups. They are, then and now, incomplete developments aimed at convincing one's that some results are true. The thing one can say is that, however shaky the arguments seem to us, they were used by these founders to prove only true results. In this very weak sense, their arguments were consistent. Now, is the "way of arguing" of our fathers consistent? Again, the meaning of this question is problematic, because there is no unique way to deduce from a finite set of examples was what the "way or arguing" of our founding fathers. What is sure is that a naive reader of their arguments, trying to guess, "by induction" in the sense of natural sciences, what was the way of arguing of these people, and trying to apply this way of arguing to get new results, would easily come across contradictions (even not so naive readers, such as Cauchy, eventually did so). Actually, it took almost 200 years for mathematicians to find a "consistent way of arguing" in which the arguments of the founder can be reformulated without too much distortion: it is the $\epsilon,\delta$ approach of Weierstrass and others. It took almost one more century to construct a second consistent approach, which perhaps has the slight advantage on the classical one to reformulate with even less distortion the arguing of the founders of calculus. Yet priority has a great weight in science, and this is the most obvious reason for which the non-standard analysis has not supplanted the traditional one. I want to finish by a side, wittgensteinian, remark: we are not in a qualitatively different situation than our founding fathers were: there is no way to be sure that our current "way of arguing" is consistent, because there is no way to be sure what our current "way of arguing" exactly is. By this I am not thinking at all at the problem that since Gödel we doubt that ZF or any other system is consistent, but to the much most basic problem that even with a "certainly consistent set of axioms" (say the axioms of the theory of groups, to fix ideas), we are not really sure what our way of arguing (that is the logico-formal rules which allow us transform statements into other statements, from axioms to theorems) is. To be sure, we mathematicians now take great care to begin a treatise by explaining carefully those "formal rules" or reasoning. Yet this formal rules use notions that are not completely clear (such as the notions of "intuitive integer") and skill that we can not be sure to posses (for example the capacity to recognize, in a finite expression, all occurrence of a given free variable). What we do is we see other people working using those rules, we try to do the same by imitation, getting punished if we do it wrong, and after some times do not make mistake anymore -- so we deduce that we understand the rules as the others do. But there is no way to be really sure of that. 

Fix an integer $a>1$. For $n \geq 1$ an integer, let $\pi_{n,1}(an)$ the number of primes $p \leq an$ such that $p \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, and $\pi(an)$ the number of all primes $p \leq an$. Let $$Q_a(n) = \frac{\pi_{n,1}(an)}{\pi(an)} \phi(n),$$ where $\phi(n)$ is Euler's phi function. If instead of fixing $a$ we fix $n$ and let $a$ goes to infinity, then by Dirichlet's theorem that $\lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} Q_a(n) = 1$. If we don't fix $n$ but let it goes to infinity fast enough relatively to $a$, for example $n=a^{1+\epsilon}$ with $\epsilon>0$ under (GRH), then one can prove that the limit is still 1 by some effective version of Dirichlet. But I am interested here in the case where $a$ is fixed. In this case, it is clear that $Q_a(n)$ varies to widely to have a limit when $n \rightarrow \infty$. Hence let us tame $Q_a(n)$ by considering, following Cesaro, $C_a(n) = \frac{Q_a(1)+\dots+Q_a(n)}{n}$.
