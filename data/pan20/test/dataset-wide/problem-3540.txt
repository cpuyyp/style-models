TLDR: Yes, cycling is better for your knees (and more than that) Cycling is significantly better for not only your knees but also your ankles and your entire spine. The fact that you push a pedal won't hurt your knee, the sudden impacts while running is what will hurt the join. These sudden impacts are also the reason why it's worse for your spine and ankles. Cycling is actually a good sport if you have problems with your spine, for instance if you have a herniated lower back. Keep in mind: You burn less calories while cycling than whilest you're running, so if your goal is to lose weight you have to keep in mind you'll have to spend more time on a bike to burn the same amount of calories. 

Getting protein on a vegan diet is pretty simple. You can get it from tempeh, tofu, lentils, chickpeas, numerous types of beans, nutritional yeast, soy products and more. As for the weight gain. It looks to me as if you've just started adding weight training to your primarily cardio based routine. This combined with the fact that you know you eat more calories than you need in order to lose weight makes the fact that you gain weight pretty logical to me. If you've gained weight as in muscle mass, that's probably the reason why you gained weight. If you mainly gained fat, there is another issue at hand. 

To gain muscle you need progressive overload. By the looks of it you train very intense, but in a different way. If you want to gain muscle, you should train a bit less, I'd say 4 to 5 days a week, and go heavier on your lifts. You should try a 5x5 program on your compound lifts, this is highly effective. Resting periods and a proper diet are as important if not more than the lifting itself, keep this in mind. You say you're vegan, which is great! But you need to make sure you are getting enough nutrients to gain muscle, if you're eating 2000 calories a day but also burn that much, your body doesn't have anything to build muscle from. I would suggest a lot of lentils, beans, chickpeas, broccoli, that kind of foods. Also, abs are made in the kitchen, as stated before. As for building the actual muscle, my opinion is that heavy compound lifts like squats or deadlifts are more beneficial than doing an endless amount of crunches or leg raises. 

A few things: 1. You'll need to adjust your eating habits The most important thing about losing weight (in my opinion) is nutrition. The reason you've gained this much weight is probably bad nutrition so I advise you to start eating more healthy foods and cut down on foods that are high in calories. 2. Working out You won't instantly need to start going ham on your workouts. Your body will need to get used to working out. Even going for 1 hour walks will make a significant difference in not only reducing your bodyweight but regaining the ability to do both strenght- and cardio-type training. When you've done this for a little while you can start doing more intense workouts. You'll need to find out when this point comes for you, this could be within a week or 2, but it could also take a bit longer. 3. Do something you enjoy In order to succeed in losing weight and staying at the goal weight you might set, you'll need to find something you enjoy doing. If you enjoy cycling, do that, if you enjoy bodyweight training, do that! As long as it is some type of physical exercise you enjoy, you'll be losing weight, getting more healthy and keep going at it :) 4. Don't worry about numbers Last but not least. I don't think you should be staring at numbers to determine if you're successful or not. If you're feeling better, you're doing great. If you like the way you look? You're doing great! There is no need to say "I want to weigh X-amount" or "I want to run 10 miles in X-amount of time" and not be happy untill you reach this number. And the optional extra, finding a workout partner! Some days it's just hard to find motivation. On these days it can help a ton having a partner that can get you off the couch and into the gym! A training partner can also help if you don't know how to do certain exercises properly because you can't always see everything you're doing. Because of this I'm a huge advocate for workout partners. I hope this helps! 

It depends on your goal. If you want to be able to do 500 push-ups in a row someday, you'd want to add reps. If you want to get stronger, you'd want to add weight. If you want to grow in size, you'd want to add weight. If you'd want to train for endurance, you'd be better off adding reps. 

You can do both push-up and dip variations to target the lower part of the pectoral, and you can do both of these exercises at home. Do push-ups in a incline position to target the lower pecs. Do dips at a slight angle to target the (lower part of the) pecs as well. Hope it helps. 

The only thing I can't answer right now is the back pain issue, where does it hurt? Does the bar simply hurt on top of your shoulders? Or did you feel pain in your lower back? I hope this helps, let me know! 

In short, you can't target fatloss. You can however make some healthy changes to your life, most of which you've already done by the looks of it. Most people have a hard time losing fat on their abdominal area. The only thing you can do is keep living healthy, tracking caloric intake, making sure you get enough rest and working out regularly. Things like ab workouts won't help you lose belly fat faster than doing cardio,the contrary is actually true. You'll lose faster doing cardio, high intensity interval (HIIT) or heavy compound lifts rather than doing isolation exercises like crunches. 

If there is a difference in grip it might change the amount of reps you can do. Other than that, from my personal experience I can do the same amount of reps on virtually any kind of horizontally oriented object I come accros. It doesn't even need to be round, it could be a brick wall or the (squared) metal frame on a bridge. This probably due to the fact that during pull-ups, even on a bar, I have my thumbs over the top of the bar rather than underneath (see image). So I basically hang with my fingers. You can have this type of grip on most objects. If you're not used to doing pull-ups like this I could see this being a reason to not being able to do the same reps as on a regular bar. 

As far as I can see you've been only working out for 3 weeks. I suggest you take some pictures or measure your legs right now. After measuring, be consistent in your training, eating and rest periods for the next 6 months. I see that you're eating over 4000 calories and 120+ grams of protein a day, this should give you ample fule to grow. After 6 months, measure again and I'm without a doubt sure that you will have gained mass on your legs. 

Secondly; you need to practice the transition movement. You'll need to create some sort of momentum to get your first muscle up done. After that you can start to perfect the movement and use less and less momentum until you can do a strict muscle up. You have different variations, some people use a swing (note that the person isn't holding the rings correctly in this image): 

Yes this can be the case. Anterior pelvic tilt basically means that your hips are tilted forward, because of this your entire spine is tilted. Your hip flexors are probably shortened which causes your pelvis to tilt, if you maintain a neutral posture this will be harder on your muscles because they are essentially stertching at that point. So yes, you will get tired from it and might even get sore muscles around your hips and lower back. 

TLDR: Yes, joining a gym to work out and eat more (good) food will help you gain weight, and I'll explain how to start off. First off, 4 years ago I was right where you are. I'm 184cm tall and would weigh about 56kg. In the first two years I gained about 20kg, but I had to work very hard for it so don't think this will come easy. You'll need to start working out, I advice either 3 or 4 days a week. I would advice to do a mix of weight training and bodyweight training. So things like benchpress, deadlifts, squats, shoulderpress, combined with things like push-ups, pull-ups, planking. This will give you a well rounded plan which will incorporate every muscle in the body. You'll also need to adjust your eating habits. Since you'll be burning a lot more calories because of all the working out, you'll also need to consume loads more, especially because you want to increase your weight. Since you are a vegetarian, things like beans, lentils and all kinds of nuts will be good to increase your caloric intake. You'll also need to consume enough protein, quark-yoghurt is a good source for this for vegetarians. What worked for me is to also consume a lot of carbohydrates, so I eat about half a bread each day with things like peanut butter. One of the most important things to note is that gaining weight won't happen overnight. You'll need to be patient with it. I hope this helps, if you have any furthuer questions feel free to ask them. Also, if I missed anything feel free to add it in the comments. 

I do a lot of calisthenics myself and see great results, so bodyweight exercises can definitely get you muscle. The thing about gaining weight is simply, it comes down to calories in vs. calories out. If you do push-ups and eat enough (healthy foods), your chest will grow. Adding in things like nuts will help you increase your size since they contain a lot of fats and protein. Eat these in between meals as a snack. If you have a hard time eating because you cannot consume big meals that often, you can try to turn some meals into shakes, like put some fruits in a blender and drinking it. As far as exercises go, there are a lot of push-up variations, you can look it up on google. For shoulders you can learn to do handstands, and later handstand push-ups for more strength. For legs you can try pistol squats for power, and box jumps for explosiveness. Lunges are good aswell. I hope it helps.
