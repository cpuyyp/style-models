Anyone can declare that he or she is running for president of the United States. That is essentially unrelated, however, to whether he or she will be placed on the ballot, much less have a chance of winning. To become president, one must win a majority in the Electoral College, and barring an extraordinary bout of collegiate faithlessness, that means you will need to get electors who support you selected. The selection of electors is largely a matter of state, not federal law, but at the very least, you'll need to qualify for the ballot in every state and the District of Columbia. If you're representing a party, you'll need to be certified as that party's candidate, a process which also depends on state law and party rules. So, determining the longest-running campaign has numerous answers depending on how you define a candidate: Anyone who declares? Anyone who won delegates? Anyone who got ballot access? Anyone nominated by a party with ballot access in XX% of the states? Anyone who received above XX% of the popular vote in a primary or the general? Anyone who won electoral votes? Anyone who had an actual chance of winning? Some possibilities include the following: Major party candidates 

There is a history of anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia, but even taking that into consideration, the violence of 1998 was unusually extreme and virulent, attributed to the encouragement of the army and the Suharto regime. Jemma Purdey's Anti-Chinese Violence in Indonesia, 1996–1999 (2006) examines large-scale violence of the kind exemplfieid by the 1998 riots. 

Gustav II Adolf of Sweden was killed in a cavalry charge, in 1632. Charles XII was killed in battle in 1718. I'm not saying he was the last monarch to see battle action. What counts here is that modern warfare already dawned. They themselves are reputed for major innovations in the way war is waged, and for building one of the most advanced armies of their time - that of Sweden. We are dealing with the age when the officer corps took a distinct form from the rest of the army. The nobles started assuming the roles of officer. Their sphere of combat activity crossed less and less from that of the rank and file. In the feudal age, the nobles and common soldiers fought side to side because the army did not form a disciplined body, so there was no need of officers. If there is no such thing as a specialized officer corps, the idea of a monarch active in battle isn't such shocking a thing. Only if a nation has an advanced military organization, such as Britain in the XX century, the idea sticks out. King Charles, for whom the role of officer already supplanted completely that of soldier, was killed in 1718, so my best guess is that no later than the XVIII century the last Western monarch participated in a battle directly. Charles XII was quite atypical, in the sense that he had a disdain for pain, and loved war very much, which made him ignore the custom of his time. Even the fact that Macedon fought personally is quite shocking, since his basic role was that of a tactician - he who thinks and motivates (as opposed to he who acts), and the military organization of his age admitted well the idea of a non-combatant commander. You should consider that monarchs stopped fighting personally when the risk of being killed stopped being correlated with the amount of protection they received. In pre-gunpowder warfare, the best set of armor, the best horse and several hundred hand-picked warriors - the best of the realm - forming besides you - dropped the chance of you being killed by at least 95%. Once gunpowder changed the nature of war, this reduction became a mere, say, 5%. No matter how well the leader was protected, it was still relatively easy for him getting killed. If Charles died in 1718, and if he was the last to be killed, he most certainly was one of the very last to fight, since if you fought, chances were 95% you got killed. 

Hormisdas is of Persian origin, and he possibly took the name to honor a Persian noble named Hormizd. In the tenth century we had a Pope Landus, or Lando, and various sources say that this name is of Anglo-Saxon origin. Lando was also his given name, however, and I find it unlikely than an Italian from Sabina would have been given an Anglo-Saxon name. What can be said is that he was the last pope to have taken an original name, until Francis. Incidentally, francis seems to have been the Latin name for the Celts or the Suebi, and not Germanic as you suggest. 

Ruhollah Khomeini came to prominence for opposing various actions and policies of the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the early 1960s, such as removing the requirement for public officials to swear oaths on the Koran, and the appropriation and redistribution of land from religious estates. He was imprisoned and kept under house arrest for a period, then on November 4, 1964 deported to Turkey. He remained in Turkey less than a year, then relocated to Najaf in Iraq, where he spent most of the remainder of his exile. He continued to agitate against the shah's regime, and as antigovernment sentiment intensified in Iran throughout 1978, the imperial government wanted to increase his physical distance from Iran. They pressured Iraq to expel Khomeini, and he was deported to Kuwait on October 6, 1978. He had originally planned to relocate to Syria, but his aides noted that he would be monitored and highly restricted if he stayed anywhere in the Middle East. He requested and received political asylum in France instead, and on October 8 he relocated to a rented house in Neauphle-le-Château outside of Paris. The move was a huge boost to his cause. It put him within reach of the international news media and sympathetic (at least in their opposition to the shah) intellectuals, but perhaps more importantly, the phone infrastructure in Europe was far more reliable, enabling him to stay in close touch with contacts in Iran and participate in the groundwork for the post-imperial regime. If he had stayed in southern Iraq, who knows whether he would have had such a profound influence on subsequent events. 

It was not so much a question of being able to raise investments, but of being able to do so at an interest rate sustainable for business. Law, be it religious or not, increases artificially the interest rate, thus seriously crippling economic life, but it never effectively eradicates it. 

Setting aside the purely military argument, I would like to underline the way political organization impacts the outcome of battle and war. In battle itself, European medieval armies were essentially fragmented and incoherent masses of warriors. There was no such thing as moving as a body or attacking as a body. Each warrior, very highly trained and equipped in himself, could not have been coerced by the commander to act in concert with his comrades. The commander did not have the authority to do so, given the fact that his soldiers were in themselves independent political entities, and did not have the means, because the capacity of tactical action is acquired through military drill and instruction. Only a standing army is capable of that, and the feudal system didn't know such thing. The French knights, for instance, were so fiery in their desire to clash with the enemy at Crecy, that they trampled under their horses the Genovese crossbowmen who began peppering some on the English side. The commander, once the enemy was in sight, had very little control over the army. The Mongols did not have that. Theirs was a highly centralized political system, almost despotic in nature, and the military organization reflected that very well. The soldier was a mere tool in the hands of his commander. There is a huge difference between an army in which the commander has great difficulty in restraining his men from attacking or compelling them to do so and an army in which the commander has the right to put to death anyone who does not show unflinching obedience. The latter can act as a tactical body, the former cannot. The maneuvers the Mongols executed could not have been achieved without the highest degree of psychological unity and coherence, itself achieved by strict and regular military drills. Again, I don't want to make the purely military aspects seem negligible, I only wanted to highlight this very important principle which fundamentally molded military history. L.E. There is another very important aspect which the lack of discipline negatively affects: the capacity of employing tactical victories in order to secure a total, strategic victory. Back in the days of feudal warfare, once a battle was won, the losing side could easily pursue a policy of detente, retreating in a fortress, for instance. Besieging was very costly in terms of both tactical considerations (knights are incapable of disciplined conduct), logistical considerations (supplying an army with food in enemy territory) and political considerations (after 40 days of army service, the knight had the right to return to his fief). Therefore the war resulted in a white peace, or in a peace slightly disadvantageous to the losers. The Mongols, on the other hand, seemed to be very effective at both field and siege battles, the main reason for it being primarily their superior discipline and their ability to keep large armies together for a long period of time. 

Kublai Khan could qualify, but the answer depends somewhat on how narrowly one defines rule. One should remember that neither city was a capital when his rule began. Supreme authority for the Mongol Empire lay in the Great Khan (Khagan), ostensibly elected from the chiefs in council (kurultai). In practice Genghis (Chinggis) Khan divided the empire among his sons and grandsons, with supreme authority to be vested in the khagan. In the west, his grandson Batu led the Golden Horde against the post-Kievan Rus. In 1237-38 he invaded the polity of Vladimir-Suzdal and razed Moscow, then little more than a trading outpost; it would not begin to prosper until late in the century, under Prince Daniel. In the east, the lands of northern China were already securely under Mongol rule. Genghis had razed the former Jurchen Jin capital of Zhongdu, on the site of modern-day Beijing, in 1215. In 1264, Kublai Khan defeated his brother Ariq Böke to become the de facto Great Khan, and moved his court from Karakorum to Zhongdu. Over the next several years, he would redevelop it into his grand capital of Dadu (Khanbalikh), proclaimed in 1271 with the founding of the Yuan Dynasty. As Great Khan, he would thus have claimed power over both Moscow and what is now Beijing. His younger brother Hulagu, who ruled as Il-Khan (subordinate khan) in Southwest Asia, and Batu's son and successor in the Golden Horde, Berke, did not challenge his claim as Great Khan. But neither did they attend the kurultai Kublai Khan called to legitimize his rule. For his part, Kublai was preoccupied with matters in China, both in administration and in invasions of Vietnam and Japan. By his death in 1294, the Golden Horde, Il-Khanate, and Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia more or less functioned independently of the Yuan emperor, and would not be subject to the Great Khan until the reign of Tamerlane. 

We could also derive a third one from the second, that is - the coin given to the barbarian mercenaries (as pay and later as tribute) also did not return to the Roman economy. The continuous debasement of the currency went hand in hand with the State's incapacity to pay it's troops. The result was allowing the troops stationed on the borders to practice farming. Some emperors even allowed them to live with their wives. From the psychological military point of view, this was a catastrophe. A farmer-soldier is cannon fodder for the semi-savage, naturally war-like barbarian peoples. The result was that the emperors started hiring barbarian mercenaries, given that the Roman troops became ineffective. This was the beginning of the end for the Roman Empire, and it began in the 3rd century. The reason why so much non-debased coin is found in Scandinavia/Britain is that the barbarians demanded imperiously pure silver/gold. The emperors had to pay them that, draining to the utmost the already scanty reserves which flowed in the civil economy. That's why you won't find pure coin on the territory of the Empire itself. Now, to answer your question itself: When precious metals started flowing anew in Europe, it was because mines were being rediscovered, especially in Central Europe: Bohemia, Austria and Southern Germany. These mines were mainly of silver. This is the basic answer.
