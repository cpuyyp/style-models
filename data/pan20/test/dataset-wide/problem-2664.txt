Arne Naess wrote several essays on the topic of the "ecological self" which are applicable in such a situation. Paraphrasing his many arguments, his argument was that the very narrowest definition of self (often conveyed by touching one's body while saying something like "this is me") proves remarkably difficult to pin down. He suggests that there are multiple valid definitions for "self," which can coexist at any time, each of which can demonstrate behaviors we associate with a self. The "ecological self" was a large class he penned to be "that which the self relates to." He made arguments along those lines that altruism could potentially be explained as selfish behavior for a larger self. He argued one could choose to view Mother Teresa not as an altruistic narrow individual, but as a selfish individual using a broad definition of self to encompass a great deal of humanity (he, of course, also argued against the negative connotation associated with selfishness, especially when that selfishness is towards a wide self). 

You make this statement axiomatically. It's an assumption. You assume humans can do this. Many have assumed similar. The result tends to cause all sorts of issues. The famous issue of the grandfather paradox is one example. An attempt to apply human intuition to a rather nuanced problem typically results in all sorts of problems, hence why it is considered a paradox. A formal approach to time is typically used to break this up. There are countless examples of where the human innate sense of time breaks down. Consider the famous Ship of Theseus. 

In computer science, equivalence is notably different than identity, so much so that computer languages often provide both as separate syntactic units. I have found in many environments, equivalence and identity are treated as different. Equivalence always requires some metric with which equivalence is defined ("Shut up and just pick an apple, Johnny. They're both equally good!"). Identity is typically treated as more of an intrinsic characteristic. The most common place I find the two words treated differently in philosophy is in scenarios handling identity in the presence of cloning. In these situations, it is easy to generate two equivalent clones, but it is less immediately clear whether there is an identity relationship to be had or not. Related, the concept of the Ship of Theseus is a major question in the philosophy of identity. It is always clear to everyone that the ship after repairs is equivalent to the ship before repairs, but the debate is whether it is identical or not. I do find that people often blur the line between equivalence and identity in situations where there is such an obvious equivalence relationship that it gets "promoted" to an identity relationship. This is easy to see in the phrase "1+1=2" which is most literally phrased "one plus one equals two," but is often vocalized as "one plus one is two." 

If one is exploring "normal" morality, one can use phrases like "killing is bad" informally. However, when exploring edge cases such as a dualist atheist, one has to be precise with wording or the arguments turn contradictory very quickly. The assumptions you state are insufficient to reach the assumption that one should become a vegetarian. You are assuming "killing is bad" should be taken to the extreme form, "any preventable death is worse than any possible benefit that could ever come from it." In such a case, you don't need qualifiers such as "atheist" or "moral." All you need is to state that a given person believes such an extreme statement and they will be forced to be a vegetarian (or unable to even eat plants, as the case may be). This is true whether they arrive at this belief through atheistic methods, or if they are given them through divine intervention from a deity. In general humans, atheist or not, recognize that morals need to be more nuanced than that. 

There may not be an answer to your question at all. Consider that that sort of predictive power would have to account for substantial variations from mind to mind. This topic also touches on the concept of qualia, for which there is myriad variation. There is also not a clear agreement as to where to draw the lines. To provide an alternate scheme to the one professed by Meyers-Briggs, I turn to Journey to the West, which specified four types of apes that defy categorization (one traditional meaning attributed to these types of apes in Journey to the West is types of personalities people can have). If nothing else, it shows how culturally specific such categorizations must be: 

Practically speaking, the first one is the most natural. However, I wanted to point out others to show that all you need to do for a null hypothesis is to identify a hypothesis which can be refuted by data which is not your claim. From that point, you could construct a test. Refuting "There are purple swans" is a tricky task, but it could be done with some reasonable level of rigor. An assay of populations in the wild which fails to demonstrate a single purple swan would be considered sufficient evidence in some fields. 

Thanks to language, we can attract things we do not expect. Consider the person who doesn't know what cancer is, but knows what a heart attack is. They spend their entire life trying to avoid a heart attack. They may use dozens of experimental prophylaxis, one of which may cause cancer. In the end, they attracted cancer. But that's not the only way to see it. The other way to see it is they attracted "things that prevent a heart attack," and one of those things happened to attract cancer. It is no surprise that schools of thought which suggest things such as The Law of Attraction also preach avoiding hate and trying to become one with Good. In this example, the individual fought against heart attacks, trying to push them out of their life and attracted everything else in the process. The Law of Attraction works much better if you presume you use it only to attract, not as a reverse-psychology trick to push things away. The law actually makes quite a lot of sense if you view things from a value optimization point of view. Your subconscious will naturally optimize itself to strive for the goals you set for it. It will find connections you never were aware of, and act on them. Honestly, the law has been phrased much more succinctly in the fairy tales. Fairy tales have a strange tendency of being filled with useful information in nice easy to digest units:
