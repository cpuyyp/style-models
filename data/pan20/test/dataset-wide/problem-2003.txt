I work in a field and industry where telecommuting is a feasible option for my role, and it is usually a matter of whether an employer will support it as a company policy. I've worked for both types: some that openly support it on a part-time basis (2 days a week usually), and some that don't support the idea at all. I usually find part time good, as opposed to 4/5 days, as it allows for in-person time to resync with employees or get face-to-face meetings done on those days. At this point in my life I have a family and a young infant in daycare near our home. My wife and I both work, and commute 1-2 hr to our jobs in the NYC area. My wife is able to work from home and only needs to commute in a couple days a week. On those days, I need to be home to manage the child drop off and pickup, as well as any occasional problem that might occur. My question is how do I work with potential employers in interviews or even an existing employer and express that this is not just a work preference, an occasional "cable guy coming by" event, but an actual family planning thing that is needed on a highly predictable 2-day a week basis? For the interview: - I frequently bring up the question as one of company culture on working from home. This is usually met with, "we allow it occasionally for one off appointments, but we prefer everyone to be in the office". They usually back it up with management's opinion that this is best for cooperation, on a company level. Even at the end of a strong interview, it is very difficult for me to pose that it is a strong requirement for me. Even to the point where I might need to be an exception to the rule for a while. How can I express this need without disqualifying myself due to a blanket policy? Should I express this need before even interviewing? Some people have advised to start with a company, and gradually try to work it in as an option. Prove yourself, start occasionally, and maybe they'll come around. I've not found this passive approach very effective. For an existing employer: The topic can be challenging. It can be that several employees in the office do have a WFH arrangement, but new arrangements are generally rejected. As an employee, I end up with the conflict that I need this arrangement or I need to find a new job to accommodate the family schedule. Overall, what can be done to express this to an employer that you otherwise mutually value and wish to stay with? 

This is what I typically see: (1) Management has duly noted you want to do a degree either before or not long after you're hired. (2)They'll also discuss with you the sort of expectation or time commitment they expect, at some point before you begin your coursework. (3)There are also sometimes contractual stipulations which protect them from grab-and-go employees, but if your company doesn't have one, then they should literally expect to see turnover. Now, some companies are really good about how they compensate and keep their employees happy despite paying for degrees, licenses, etc. They will have a lot of employees that stay comparatively and if 1/100 decides to move after graduation, they still win through majority retention (im assuming your company isnt bad, has low turnover, and doesnt spend 15K for people to up and leave). I think it's completely fair that you got your degree, that you're looking out for you and you want to move. At that, the only thing I'd do is line up a job before I moved, and scrutinize the tuition reimbursement policy and make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot. I think that most companies would like to see a 1-2yr commitment, that being said, but what they would like to see is not always in your best interest. 

IANAL Employers have the almost unlimited rights to monitor or modify anything being used on their computer system. The computer system could include: devices the employer owns, software or cloud-based systems the employer owns or administers, or any devices connected to the employers network. The idea is to protect the employer's information and intellectual property. First and foremost you can assume any electronic communication being sent over an employer's network is property of the employer, and may be privileged/confidential. The other thing that I'd assume is that because you've linked your work and personal accounts, you've also compromised your personal account. I think this is a misstep. Keep in mind that company bring-your-own-device and electronic use policies waive a lot of your rights to privacy. This could be as extreme as giving the company implicit access and permission to your personal data in pursuit of securing their information systems. That's why it's of paramount importance to carefully consider what you do with your work devices. While it's ethically wrong to access an employees private email, I think the company has a potential argument here that your "work" and "personal-work" email accounts are somehow administered under the same blanket account as your "work" email and thus all accounts need to be scrutinized. It may also be problematic for them that you're accessing personal email on the company information system. You would have been wise to completely separate your personal email account and refrain from associating it for with any work accounts at all. 

It sounds like there is a chance of possible permanent employment and your boss is letting you know this is your chance to show your interest and prove yourself. The decision could be delayed up to a few weeks before your contract ends. Once, I was in the last week of a contract when they extended my role with a full time one. What you should do is continue working hard and showing enthusiasm for the job. Show that you can fit into the team smoothly, and follow your boss's direction without conflict or abrasion. This may be as obvious as completing all your tasks exceptionally, but also going above and beyond by staying late occasionally or coming in early. Be the first one in and last one out, and even those that don't know what you're working on will assume you're a super hard worker. Your boss's peers who don't even know you will ask about you to him. And finally, open the dialog with your boss that you're interested in full time employment, and ask what the chances are that it can happen after your 3 months working. Do not repeatedly pester him with this topic, but check in once every few weeks if he has heard anything more about it. 

I've been freelancing for a former colleague of mine who has started a new business. I've known the colleague about 4 years professionally, and he reached out to me to join his business as an employee. The new company is made of mostly ex-colleagues of his so far. He has given me a full time offer contingent on the business reaching its next funding goal, likely in 1-2 months. The problem is the salary offer is about 15-25% lower than my previous job, depending on if I ignore the bonus factor. My previous salary was generous overall. I'm curious how I might negotiate this to a more reasonable number? At the very least I'd like not to take a paycut from my previous base salary. I've seen that the company is doing well so far, and the next funding will solidify it, so I don't think they are hurting for cash. The unique factor seems to be that he specifically sought me out for the position based on my unique skillset to offer within the new company, I'm the lead. I've got 10 years experience in what I do, and have created similar things to what they want in past, with lots of transferable knowledge/tools. I plan to use the next 2 months to deliver amazing results, such that he wouldn't want anyone else for the role. No one better, and no one new either. What is the best approach at getting the 15-25% more I expect? I feel like if I just stated the minimal 15% higher, it would be compromised down to somewhere lower. And if I stated "I was thinking 15-25% higher than this number", 15% is the best that would be possible. If I went high at 25% more, it might be considered absurd. At the same time, I'm interested in continuing this role, so he may know I'm not going to walk away from the low offer. I've been interviewing elsewhere with no offers yet, perhaps I play-up other company's interest? 

If it's really such a question you should definitely use a combination of circumstances to validate a business. Having a valid phone number and physical address is a good indicator but not the whole picture. If they have a website, you can try to find out who registered the domain and see if it looks reputable enough. At the same time, the website itself should look professional enough. Company reviews like BBB, Google, Yelp or what have you should have some indication that regardless if they're a good corporation or not, they're at least legitimate. If they're registered as a corporation, LLC, etc. the office of the secretary of state should also be able to tell you if they are a properly registered company. If they're publicly traded and file an SEC form 10-K, you can broadly find a tax ID called an EIN, but you should also be able to speak to payroll and obtain this number with a good reason (I don't think a company would want to go ahead and say "we're shady," but they also have to worry about identity theft so this is a long shot!) In some cases just like with taxes, web domain or corp/llc registrations, some businesses will also have to be registered to specific federal bodies based on the type of work they do, and a phone call to said agency may shed some light on the legitimacy of the suspect business (so think FDA, finCEN, etc.). All else fails, you can also go to the physical address for the business and scope them out yourself if it's possible. 

Start-ups normally require the average employee to don a number of hats because of the nature of the company type. Often understaffed, exploratory/experimental, and lots of promises on the table that need delivery. So the problem is that then, everyone is stretched super thin and you need to be able to hit the ground running. This is just an aspect of start-ups, and if you literally have no idea what they're doing I can guarantee it'll be hard without heavy research and time investment outside of regular working hours. 

I've got about 15 years experience in software engineering with a great deal of experience working with a variety of companies. I've worked with startups especially in the past 6 years, and recently have encountered something odd in salary talks when engaging a new company. These are new small startups with 5-7 ppl, usually 2 cofounders and about 4 dev capacity people. They are well funded at this point usually. What I've encountered is these cofounders assume all tech people on the team will be paid the same salary. This might work if everyone has the same experience or role but often I'm sought because of my experience and ability to deliver and then assumed to be paid the same generic rate as someone 10 years my junior professionally. Or, the founders think they are being generous but fair by not paying anyone more or negotiating one or another. That they are supporting a flat and equal structure of peers. The founders are often young themselves so may not understand how pay often rises with experience. This is not the case with larger startups usually once their hiring process becomes more formalized and isn't just one guys assumption. And obviously bigger companies have this worked out. How can I work with these situations and explain that experience is often reflected in salary and paying 15yrs experience the same as 5 isn't always assumed or might be negligent to the more experienced candidate. 

You can post your code up on a public repository using a free GitHub account. However that should be supplementary to presenting it on a resume. You probably have limited if any work experience in programming so you should use a Projects section on your resume. The restaurant system would be one project. Use about 4 bullet points to describe what you did and the technologies you used, and shows more than just listing a url or the code. Such as: 

First and foremost**, you can't be retaliated against for anything that you told HR then or now, or any time for that matter. If this ex-manager (I'll refer to them as XMAN) has some kind of vendetta against you or anyone else due to numerous like-minded claims against them, chances are they're already on thin ice. Furthermore, on the merit of "they threw me under the bus in an exit interview," to disapprove of rehiring that person is also unprofessional, since they shouldn't really know what you said to begin. Being said, you don't know what XMAN knows, only that some people left, and some changes got made that perhaps made them a little bitter. Unless they query you directly, you have no reason to believe there's a specific problem, and that it could just be that XMAN didn't like you as an employee to begin with. XMAN certainly doesn't have any obligation to know the events of the exit interview explicitly, so you have no obligation to tell them anything. In fact, as your ex-manager, they really have no reason to speak to you unless they're part of the interview and/or hiring process or somehow supervise you again. If you're being harassed by someone not on your team, go to your new manager and they should go and say "hey, you can't harass my team members." That would represent the most professional environment. **Referring mainly from the US. 

Worst case scenario you change something behind you manager's back, and he doesn't know what's going on suddenly. Makes him look bad, makes you look bad. Draft your methods going forward and present your plan to your manager, and ask that you take charge under his supervision. This is an opportunity as a junior to take on a project you're interested in. But, your manager may also have valuable input, mentoring or advisory to complement whatever it is you draft. Granted, it doesn't guarantee you'll lead those changes. I think it goes without saying, however, that in most cases you shouldn't subvert your manager.
