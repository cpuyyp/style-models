If the question is about the asymptotic behavior in high dimensions then I do not think it is known or even conjectured that the kissing number for the densest packing is not polynomial in n. To the best of my memory (but check the book by Conway and Sloane) there are no known examples of lattices where the kissing number is exponential, and the best known bound are only quasi-polynomial ($n^{\log n}$). So "dense lattice packing" and "huge kissing numbers" are not the same in very high dimensions. (There are the same in dimension 24!). If you are interested in interesting notions of low density packings you can think about packings which are locally densest but globally very undense. It does make sense to consider, even in low dimensions, what is the smallest "local maximum" for density of lattices. Update: Let me add some more details on the connection between kissing number and more generally "the low end of the distance distribution" of a packing and the density. It is convenient to talk, more genarally, about spherical codes, and also to draw the analogy with binary codes. The densest examples of spherical codes and binary error correcting codes are obtained by randomized constructions. For those the kissing number is expected to be subexponential. It is known that if these randomized bounds can be improved to get higher density than some relaxed notion of a kissing number will be exponential. (This is a result of Nati Linial and me for the binary case and I think that it was extended to larger alphabets and sperical codes.) As I mentioned for sphere packing (and I think also for general spherical codes) no example is known where the kissing number is exponential. For error-correcting codes over a large alphabet the algebraic geometric codes (which are denser than the randomized construction) give such an example. This example can be transforned to the binary case but it doesnot give a higher density. I think that the notion of minimum density among local maximum density packings was studied and also the corresponding question for covering. At least in low dimensions. This looks like the "correct" understanding of the question. But I do not recall the details. More update: Frank Vallentin gave me some further relevant information. Indeed the relevant notion in discussing the problem is that of a "perfect lattice". In a perfect lattice, the following equality is true: dim span{$v~ v^t: ~v$ shortest nonzero lattice vector} = $n(n+1)/2$. (In general one only has the inequality "$\le$") A lattice which is a local maximum for the packing density function is always perfect. Trying to find perfet lattices with low density (which seems to be one purpose of the question if we put aside the kissing number issue), is interesting. Coxeter conjectured (Extreme forms, 1951) that the lattice $A_n$, (which is perfect,) gives the lowest density among all perfect lattices. It is known to be true up to dimension 8. There is another conjecture by Conway and Sloane (Low dimensional lattices III, Perfect forms, 1988) saying that Coxeter's conjecture is wrong if the dimension is large enough... 

OK, the conjecture is false, as noted below. However there was a comment below about the property of approximate identities and whether this might still be true. After some thought I think that the problem is related to functional calculus of several commuting operators. Or rather to this modification: What happens to the functional calculus of several bounded operators which only almost commute, $f(T,S)$ where $\|[T,S]\|<\epsilon$? For an approximate identity we do have for fixed $n$, $\|[u_n,u_m]\|\to 0$ as $m\to\infty$, so it might still be possible to formulate the construction if a small commutator does not matter... Yes, making this into a general note about functional calculus of two non-commuting operators is a but of an extrapolation..... 

Suppose that $H$ is a Hopf algebra with normalised invariant integral (appropriate side) $\int:H\to \mathbb{C}$. The $H$ right comodule algebra $P$ is a Hopf Galois extension, so the canonical map $P\otimes_A P\to P\otimes H$ is a 1-1 correspondence, where $A$ is the $H$ invariant part of $P$. There is an averaging map $E:P\to A$ given by $E(p)=p_{(0)} \ \int(p_{(1)})$ which gives a projection to the subalgebra $A$ and is an $A$ bimodule map. Now let us also suppose that $P$ is a $C^*$ algebra, and that $H$ is a Hopf star algebra with whatever other properties we need, and that the integral preserves positivity. Just when is $E$ a conditional expectation for $C^*$ algebras, i.e. when does it preserve positivity? Any nice sufficient conditions would be interesting. Apologies if I have missed something obvious in the literature... 

An obvious area to check is computational complexity. For example, "Maximize" can refer to the conjecture that computation complexity classes can be separated. Occasionally there is an unexpected collapse but generally speaking the animals in the complexity zoo are genuinly distinct. 

This relation is true for every family F and every p. It is especially famous and simple when $p=1/2$ and $\mu_p(F)=1/2$. In this case, it says that given a set of half the vertices of the discrete cube $2^X$, the number of edges between F and its complement is at least $2^{n-1}$. The Problem A family F of subsets of $2^X$ is monotone increasing if when S belongs to F and T contains S then T also belongs to F. (Monotone increasing families also also called "filtes" and "up-families".) From now on we will restrict our attention to the case of monotone increasing families. We say that a family is optimal for $\mu_p$ if the isoperimetric inequality (IR) is sharp up to a multiplicative constant $1000 log (1/p)$. 

Here is an example: 19 century geometers extended Euler's formula V-E+F=2 to higher dimensions: the alternating sum of the number of i-faces of a d-dimensional polytope is 2 in odd dimensions and 0 in even dimensions. The 19th centuries proofs were incomplete and the first rigorous proof came with Poincare and used homology groups. Here, what enabled a rigorous proof was arguably even more important than the theorem itself. 

Given a positive (or completely positive map) $\phi:A\to B$ between C* algebras, is there a way to construct an $A-B$ bimodule? This would more or less generalise the following construction: If $\phi$ was an algebra map, we could have ${}_\phi B$, which is $B$ as a vector space, with $B$ product as the right $B$ action, and left action $a. b=\phi(a) b$. If there was a Hilbert C* module, so much the better. (This is part of the idea that bimodules generalise algebra maps, and I want to look at the differentiable properties of bimodules.) 

Take $2n$-tuples of bounded positive operators $x_1,\dots x_n$ and $a_1,\dots a_n$ on a Hilbert space $H$ which have zero kernel and dense image and which satisfy the condition that (1) $$ x_1^* x_1+\dots+x_n^* x_n+a_1^* a_1+\dots+a_n^* a_n $$ is invertible and (2) that the image of $x_i^*x_i+a_i^*a_i$ and $x_i^*$ have dense intersection for each $1\le i\le n$ and (3) that we have the equality (used to define a function $T$ of the $2n$-tuple) $$ T:=x_1(x_1^*x_1+a_1^*a_1)^{-1}x_1^*=\dots=x_n(x_n^*x_n+a_n^*a_n)^{-1}x_n^*\in B(H). $$ The problem is to show that $T$ varies continuously as the $2n$-tuple (subject to the conditions) varies continuously in the norm topology. [Edit: Each formula for $T$ is a densely defined operator of norm $\le 1$, and so it extends to a bounded operator on $H$. The problem is that as far as I can see no individual formula can show the continuity of $T$ as the $2n$-tuple varies...] This question may seem strange, but it comes from representing rings of fractions in a Hilbert space. If anyone can say anything about it I would be very grateful! 

I have three (somewhat related) examples: 1) The notion of explicit construction. Seeking explicit constructions to non-constructive replace existence proofs is an old endeavor. Computational complexity offers, in some cases, formal definitions (constructions that can be dome in P or in polylog space.) But these definitions are slightly controversial. In any case people looked for explicit constructions before any explicit definition for the term explicit construction was known. 2) The notion of effective bounds/proofs. There are many important problems about replacing a proof giving non effective bounds with a proof giving effective bounds. Usually I can understand a specific such problem but the general notion of effectiveness is not clear to me. (A famous example: effective proofs for Thue Siegel-Roth theorem.) 3) Elementary proofs. I remember that finding elementary proofs for the prime number theorem was a major goal. I was told what this means many times and in a few of those I even understood. But the notion of "elementary" proof in analytic number theory remained quite vague for me. 

The concentration of measure phenomenon and (related to it) the modern developments related to isoperimetric relations can be regarded as a large mathematical programme which involves analysis, geometry, various applications to other disciplines, combinatorics and algebra. 

NOTE - I have just read the comment on the existence of these approximate identities below - this certainly solves my immediate problem. I now have to find a reference. Many thanks to all involved! I am still curious about the two non-commuting operators though. 

Take generators $a_{ij}$ for $1\le i,j\le n$. Impose relations which come from the matrix \begin{eqnarray*} P=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}a_{11} & \dots & a_{1n} \\\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\a_{n1} & \dots & a_{nn}\end{array}\right) \end{eqnarray*} being a Hermitian projection, i.e. $a_{ij}^*=a_{ji}$ and $\sum_j a_{ij}\,a_{jk}=a_{ik}$. Is there a unital universal $C^*$ algebra with these generators and relations? If not, what can be said? Why is this algebra interesting? The answer is that it might (in some sense) classify finitely generated projective modules over a local $C^*$ algebra $A$. Such modules give projections in $M_n(A)$, and an argument from Blackadar's book shows that these can be made Hermitian. But such a Hermitian projection is just a map from the algebra with generators and relations defined above to $A$. 

I would like a finite dimensional irreducible representation of ${PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which contains a proper sub-representation when restricted to the congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$, the kernel of $\mathrm{mod}_2:{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\to {PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. This would be used in constructing exact sequences of differential calculi on group algebras, and examining what relations exist between the differential invariants and the group structure. A seriously infinite noncommutative example would be really useful. I have read the paper on the irreps of $B_3$ and ${PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ by Imre Tuba and Hans Wenzl, but after calculations on some (I have not tried all of them!) of their examples, I cannot get a reducible rep for $\Gamma(2)$ which was not already reducible for ${PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. 

Here is a (little wild) question about Boolean functions with countably many variables and a wild analog for Fourier-Walsh functions and analysis based on them. Let $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n,\dots$ be Boolean variables. We will consider real functions on these countably many variables. Consider the following three classes of functions. 1) (Ultrafilter-Rademacher.) Let $X$ be the set of natural numbers. Let $F$ be an ultrafilter on $X$. Thus if $A \in F$ and $A \subset B$ then also $B \in F$; If $A,B \in F$ so is their intersection; and every set $Y \subset X$, $Y$ or its complement are in $F$. Define $W_F (S)=1$ if $S \notin F$ and $W_F(S)=-1$ if $S \in F$. 2) (Ultrafilter-Walsh) Let $G$ be a finite family of ultrafilters. define $W_G$ as the product of all $W_F$ for $F \in G$. questions: a) Are all the $W_G$ (or just the $W_F$) linearly independent as real functions on $X$? (Regard 1 as the empty product; if not what are the dependencies?) b) Is this set of function form (in some sense) an interesting basis for (some) space of Boolean functions on $X$? One step further We can go one step further Let $Z$ be an infinite set and consider Boolean variables $x_z$ (attaining the values $\pm 1$,) one for each element $z \in Z$. A generalized parity function is a Boolean function on these variables with the property that $f$ is one for the all one vector and $f(y)=-f(x)$ if $y$ differs from $ x$ in one coordinate. Let $Z$ be a set of ultrafilters and let $P$ be a generalized parity function on variables indexed by $Z$. (On a finite set a generalized parity function is simply the parity function.) The generalized parity product (GP-product) $g$ of the ultrafilters in $Z$ is defined as follows: Let $S$ be a subset of $N$. For $z \in Z$ let $x_z=-1$ if $S \in z$ and $x_z=1$, otherwise. Let $$g(S)=P(x_z: z \in Z).$$ We can consider a third class of functions 3) (Ultrafilter-ultrawalsh) Let $C$ be the class of all $GP$-products of ultrafilters. This is much more general than functions of the form $W_G$ (for them $Z$ is finite and we have a usual parity function) Question: What is the space spanned by ultrafilter ultrawalsh functions and what are the linear dependencies among them. The general question: The general question is: Can insights (questions, results etc.) regarding Boolean functions on finitely many variables (from combinatorics or complexity theory) be extended to Boolean functions on infinite sets of variables with "dictatorships" being replaced by "ultrafilters." Another question is if these classes of functions can further be extended to describe a basis/spanning set (just for finite linear combinations) of real functions defined on the discrete cube with countable-dimension. Remark: Of course, if these classes of functions were considered (or even used for something) before I will be happy to know. Generalized parity functions appeared in Mike Sipser's work and he used them to show that Borel sets cannot compute them (inspiring the later Furst-Saxe-Sipser paper that (finite) parity is not in $AC^0$. (I thank Avi Wigderson for telling me about it.) I think it might be related to some recent posts (like this one) on Gowers's blog. For more on ultrafilters and mainly ultraproduct see this recent post in Tao's blog. 

There follows a possible construction, and I would like to know if it or a similar construction has been done before (as I suspect), so that I can reference it, or if it obviously does not work! Any useful comments welcomed. What is wanted is the noncommutative analogue of taking an open subset of a compact Hausdorff topological space, and taking the continuous complex functions on that open set, with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of the open set. (Noting that such functions are often unbounded.) The NC setup - let $A$ be a unital separable C* algebra, with 2-sided ideal $J$. We do not want to take $A/J$, but instead take a countably many seminorm construction based on certain states on $A$. In the commutative case they would be states with measures supported away from the closed set where the elements of $J$ vanish. In the noncommutative set up, it seems likely that such states can be constructed from an approximate unit of $A/J$. An appropriate modification of $a\mapsto \phi(u_n a u_n)$ where $u_n\in A/J$ is the approximate unit and $\phi$ a state of $A/J$, with suitable cut offs and sums with $1/2^m$ weights might work. Then such states would give countably many seminorms to give an algebra larger than $A/J$ (and likely not separable). The background: How to define meromorphic functions in noncommutative complex geometry? The starting ideal $J$ would correspond to where the poles (or divisor) would have to be. Of course the preceeding construction (if it worked) would generate really horrible functions in general, but the big problem is how to get unbounded functions at all - once they exist it should be possible to choose nicer ones. 

There is a relevant paper by Gromova regarding high dimensional matrices: Gromova, M. B., The Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem for polystochastic matrices. (Russian) Operations research and statistical simulation, No. 2 (Russian), pp. 3–15, 149. Izdat. Leningrad. Univ., Leningrad, 1974. It was translated to English in the early 90s. The MR review by by George P. Barker reads: In Section 1 the author gives the basic definitions and introduces a notion of the spectrum of a multidimensional matrix as a vector. The basic theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a vector to be the spectrum of an extremal matrix is then formulated. The necessary condition of the basic theorem consists of a direct generalization of the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem. A related paper is: Brualdi, R. A.; Csima, J. Extremal plane stochastic matrices of dimension three. Linear Algebra and Appl. 11 (1975), no. 2, 105–133. and an older paper with some relevance is: Jurkat, W. B.; Ryser, H. J. Extremal configurations and decomposition theorems. I. J. Algebra 8 1968 194–222. 

Very little is known about the question (and even about the easier case of vertex degrees), and it contains as a special case some notoriously hard questions: For example the case that all $d_i$s are equal to 1 (or to some $\lambda$ is the question on the existence of combinatorial designs of certain parameters. I suppose that even checking if a sequence is a dgree sequence is computationally intractable, for large values of $d$ but I am not sure about that. 

This question is about extending modules of fractions to bimodules of fractions. I would not be surprised if the result is known, I have tried looking in Goodearl and Warfield, but may have missed the point as I am not an expert in algebra. The motivation lies in looking at invertible bimodules in non commutative algebraic geometry. Given sufficient conditions, for a ring $R$ and a multiplicative set of regular elements $X$ we can form the ring of fractions $RX^{-1}$. Now for an right $R$ module $E$, we can form the right $RX^{-1}$ module $E \otimes_R RX^{-1}$. However suppose that $E$ is actually a $R$-bimodule. When is $E \otimes_R RX^{-1}$ then a $RX^{-1}$ bimodule? As I see it, this question can be phrased in the same sort of terms as the Ore condition on the ring, that is given $x\in X$ and $e\in E$ is there $y\in X$ and $f\in E$ so that $ey=xf$. Is this the right approach? If so, are there general conditions saying when this construction works? Where can I find out about it? Apologies for my lack of knowledge here, I hope that this does not sound too trivial to the experts. The idea is to apply it to localisation of bimodules over quantum groups and their homogenous spaces. Edit: I should say that the reason why I want $E \otimes_R RX^{-1}$ rather than something potentially bigger to be the bimodule is that otherwise taking fractions will not commute with tensor product, or rather we will likely not get a monoiodal functor between bimodule categories.
