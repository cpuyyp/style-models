First things first. Black Dwarfs A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled down to be in thermal equilibrium of the space around it. It's just a dense lump in thermal equilibrium with it's surroundings. Studying them is pointless if you have already studied white dwarfs because they're just cold white dwarfs - nothing to see here. So we can skip black dwarfs completely. White dwarfs A white dwarf can form from almost any star - that is, the vast majority of stars is the Milky Way will become white dwarfs. So these are "easy" to make and messing around with blue dwarfs as an intermediate stage is just pointless farting around. So we just grab any old main sequence star with a mass of no more than about 10 solar masses and fiddle with that to make a white dwarf, right ? Wrong. We've already found white dwarfs and why make one when there's already one made for you ? So we can happily skip the tedious make-your-own-white dwarf step too. So far, so trivial. :-) Red Dwarfs We've already got those so we can again skip the make-your-own stage. In fact we humans have one next door - Proxima Centauri. Maybe your aliens won't be so lucky, but they might even have one in the same system as they live in. So we're skipping that stage too. Leaving us with ... Blue Dwarfs These, as far as we know, do not yet exist. To "make" one you need a red dwarf of greater than 0.25 solar masses and not more than 0.35 solar masses (the upper limit for red dwarfs). You also need to wait until the red dwarf fuses basically all the Hydrogen in it's core. Then it starts to burn other nuclei and that's when it becomes blue. And to do this you just wait. A long time. Alternative. Start with a lot of helium - enough to make a blue dwarf core (I do not know how much that would be). Introduce it somewhere in "empty" space, ideally directing it towards a common central area. Add hydrogen ("lots") in a similar way when the central area is reasonably concentrated (but before fusion starts). This should increase the rate of collapse and if you add enough of the right materials you will get a helium core surrounded by a hydrogen body - more or less a blue dwarf. Fusion should start "normally" from gravitational pressure and you can monitor the whole thing to your heart's content. A few minor details. To do any of this (including visit existing distant white dwarfs) you need FTL drives. If you can build FTL drives you then have only the "minor" difficultly of being able to transport enough material to make a small star (about 0.25 solar masses of the stuff) to your test site to make your blue dwarf. The energy requirements for this would seem insane. However, if you can do all these things then a couple of really difficult problems remain : 

Hotter planets will have less viscous lava This one is pretty self-explanatory, since the hotter the temperature, the less solid almost all materials tend to be. Also, from the Wikipedia page on lava compositions: 

Water is not necessary for a planet to have an atmosphere. Planets like Mars have atmospheres without there being water on the planet. (It is worth noting that Mars' atmosphere is about 100x thinner than Earth's, but that is due to its lack of magnetic field rather than any lack of water. In fact, the article just linked states that its thin atmosphere is the reason all the surface water on Mars dried up.) Even if you need a human-breathable atmosphere, there is no need for water vapor. As explained in this answer, the atmospheric pressure and relative amounts of different gasses in the atmosphere will have a much greater effect on an atmosphere's breathability than the presence or absence of water will. As for humans needing drinking water to survive on the planet in the first place, you could have it shipped in from other planets if space travel is available, or have moisture farmers (sort of Luke's aunt and uncle on Tatooine) that mine or gather water from the sparse underground sources you mentioned. 

Magic is easier to teach than the available technology (is learning casting a teleportation spell easier than driving a car or flying a plane?) Magic is less expensive to use than the available technology (is Floo Powder easier to make than jet fuel -- and the jet itself?) Magic is religiously (think Amish) or socially acceptable over technology (combustion engines require consumption of fossil fuels, which depletes the earth!) 

More viscous: silica, aluminum, potassium, sodium, and calcium (think quartz, with its highly structured molecular form) Less viscous: iron, magnesium, magnesium oxide 

Depending on the tech level of your world, I see a few different solutions being plausible. 1. A lobotomy (as mentioned by A.C.A.C. in the comments) reduces the amount of complexity a person's brain can handle, by simply cutting out a portion of the physical brain. Lobotomies were widely used as a treatment for mental disorders in the 1940s and 50s: 

Sounds a bit robot like. Not the behavior of sentient beings. More likely they would employ their ability to glide when it's useful for transportation, eat, defense or simply for fun. Even humans like to fly (well, some humans). They could even use it to make money ! 

In a single century ??? Even if a quarter of the population are of child-bearing age in any five year period and they produce four children per couple in that period that survive to adulthood, they will barely be able to make the 100,000 mark in a 100 years. But just sex alone won't keep a population alive ! They need food and shelter. And in your society they also need education and light and heat and protection and health care. And that takes time to build and resources to make. Humans take time to grown and are not productive for the early part of their lives and cannot be as physically productive in their later years. Factoring in all these things means your society will expend most of it's resources in simply expanding it's numbers and being able to keep them. Rather than being able to focus on technology, they'll have to focus on agriculture and basic building and basic infrastructure - try designing and maintaining a sewage and water system for just 100,000 people ! So this is not realistic in any way. They'd have a hard time just maintaining the technological level they started with, let alone improving it. 

They can attempt to undermine you on the bottom. This is exactly what it sounds like : they mine under your existing systems, perhaps by developing a beachhead at one the existing entrances. They can then tunnel and use that to deliberately undermine the structural integrity of the support for the levels above. This is a well established technique in ancient warfare. It becomes even more problematic for you if they can deploy any form of explosives (including magic). 

Basically, even for viscous materials, heat tends to destroy any bonds between the molecules, allowing them to slide past each other more easily, and making the liquid less viscous. Chemical composition plays a big part too Viscosity can be defined as "resistance in the flow of a liquid." Therefore, materials with molecules that: 

... and many more. Basically whatever you can think of. But however magic works in your universe, it should be treated as an alternative technology, rather than an alternative to technology. 

Summary If you are looking to make a lava lake that creatures can plausibly swim through, a mixture of super high temperatures and compositions of iron and magnesium will most likely yield the best results. 

tend to have a harder time flowing past each other, and thus are more viscous. Some examples of real-life lava materials, in order of decreasing viscosity (again from this wikipedia page): 

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -Arthur C. Clarke (more info) In other words, you should treat magic like another form of technology. Other answers have tried to argue that using magic over technology precludes the need for both education and research, but in all magic systems I can think of: 

If the people in the alternate reality in question have a basic knowledge of genetics: Females have only X sex chromosomes while males have both an X and a Y. The Y chromosome is inseparably connected to their spirit in a way that X chromosomes never are. Since these are the chromosomes responsible for developing a person's reproductive system, the reproductive contribution of a male is the spirit, where the female's is everything else. If they don't: To be honest, you probably don't even have to explain anything. Just state what happens as you did in the question and that'll be enough of an explanation on its own. 

Seems like a lot of effort to get very little reward. Your goal is story telling, not modeling the galaxy. There are perhaps 400 billions stars in the galaxy and you need maybe a hundred, perhaps a thousand at most for a comprehensive story. Pick the most promising/interesting ones that might be useful for colonists/explorers and work from that data set. Work out the most likely paths for travel and what features of this will be of interest to your story. But expending effort trying to recreate a model of this is pointless. I always like to reference Issac Asimov's Foundation series of stories. He was a Phd in science and yet he simply wrote what he needed to write, not what precisely modeled anything. The precise position of things is not needed, but the rough relationship of things and people to each other is. Detail isn't needed. Frankly I think many modern writers get obsessive about detail and forget the storytelling part. So pick the stars you want to be in your story universe and work from that. 

A human brain is thought to contain about 86 billion neurons and these neurons can be modeled reasonably accurately bu a set of four equations known as the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which has four variables and is first order, meaning we need about eight numbers to store it's state at any instant. So assuming each number can be stored as a standard double precision floating point numbers ( 64 bits each ) then we need $4.4\times 10^{13}$ bits or about 5.5 GB. Which is a surprisingly small number, well withing the reach of current computers. Of course doing 86 billions calculations involving solving 4 simultaneous differential equations with any reasonable speed is well beyond anything we can currently do in a brain-sized object. Apparently the peak rate a neuron fires is about 1000 Hz and that's the minimum to consider a computer brain "simulation". That means we need something like to be able to do about $9\times 10^{13}$ of these mathematical solutions per second, and each of those would take perhaps a thousand floating point operations. So that's ballpark $10^{16}$ Flops. That's about the same computing power as IBM's Sequoia super computer, which occupies about $280\,m^2$ and consumes a staggering 6 megawatts of power, all of which has to be dealt with for cooling purposes. Note that the 5.5 GB of memory can't be standard memory like your PC has. We'd really be using memory-per-neuron with some working store. More like a giant GPU with lots of local memory for neuron state and local calculations and access to global memory when needed. That would considerably increase power consumption and hence heat dissipation issues. At least an order of magnitude.
