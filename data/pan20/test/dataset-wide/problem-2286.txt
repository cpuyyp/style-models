So you'll see Easy is pretty broad, and covers everything up to a 5, so walking up to hard scrambling. There is a good conversion chart at the British Mountaineering Council website which also includes French and Australian grades. 

I haven't used one, but I can see how that could help - a higher stroke rate can be more efficient in single paddle canoeing. 

This one is actually much simpler than you might realise: On a three feathered arrow, the nock is at 90 degrees to one feather, and at 30 degrees to the other two feathers. If the cock feather was pointed towards the bow, it would be much more likely to hit the bow than the other feathers would if the arrow was rotated the other way. So having it in an obvious colour just makes it quick and easy to know which way is less likely to cause accuracy issues. The feather itself is physically the same as the others. For more experienced archers, who can fully use the archer's paradox, the colour may simply aid in nocking the arrow quickly, as you can ensure it is always the correct direction. 

Paul and Kevin are correct here - any corrective lens has to alter what your eye sees. Your brain very rapidly corrects (a few minutes) but it is a basic function of optical physics that is unavoidable. It's not because of two layers of glass, it is the correction process - you are changing the light path. I would suggest that if you need the corrective lenses you just wear them in the goggles permanently. It doesn't sound like contacts are a useful solution for you anyway, so when skiing, just use glasses all day. 

Then, once hiking, if you see a bird not on your whitelist, just leave it be. This way saves a lot of problems, and legal consequences. 

I think your criteria are all good, in that you should choose one that is suitable for the environments you will be adventuring in, but price is almost irrelevant, and unless you are hiking really long distances weight wouldn't worry me. For me, critical features would include: 

The only real difference is that in a one piece double you don't have zips so the insulation is evenly distributed. The zips add some weight over a one piece but not much - it also won't pack quite as small but has the advantage that it can be split across two packs. Where you have zips, the insulation has gaps. So if you are going somewhere really cold, you might want to go with a one piece. I far prefer the two pieces that mate together because I carry a much higher temperature than my wife so I like the fact I can unzip and roll my side down to my waist if need be. Also easier to pop in the washing machine :-) 

While there are country specific regulations which may apply close to shore or on inland waterways, the international community agrees that the COLREGs form the basis for rules, so as long as you know them you will be at least on the right side of the law. The standard for lights is the same the world over and while you may have some specific rules when racing, for example, this should not change the COLREG guidance. 

This is why most snowboarding and skiing gloves these days have a wiper built in. Rain-X and other coatings can help a little, but there appears to be no all purpose solution, so just get a pair of gloves with a wiper, and get used to using it frequently. 

So perhaps the most useful recommendation would be to speak to locals in each area you travel to, to understand what areas are considered safe, and whether they have local guidelines on food storage, proximity to open areas, gun permits etc. And of course that guidance would hold for any such area. 

They can't run for long periods. They have brief sprints up to about 12mph so you can outrun one, especially if you keep going. That said, alligators don't attack humans. From this LA Times article: 

Simply put, walking, even long distance walking, is not that much trouble for a human. We have evolved to cope with keeping up a constant pace for far further than any prey we typically hunt. All you need to do is avoid major impact, and feed with a lot of calories. For your upper body, focus on what you need to do. Are you carrying a heavy pack? If so, carrying a heavy pack is a good way to keep this fitness. If you are more of a daysack kind of person, then carry a light pack. Muscle distribution happens because of what you do, so decide what you will need, and just do that. This is really much simpler than I think you realise. 

I have always taught sailing students to run a full check every time they rig the boat (if it's a dinghy or the mast is regularly lowered) or annually before returning it to the water after winter. Additionally, a full check after any collision or incident is recommended. The problem is that while you can look for worn rigging, it can be very difficult to see problems in areas above your eye-line, and deterioration varies due to conditions, storage, sailing stresses, etc so is unpredictable. 

Having spent most of my life within a couple of miles of the beach in pretty windy areas, I have learned some tried and tested things you can do (although I have never found it much of an issue in any case) 

On your descent, assuming you don't have an overhang, you simply place your heels against the wall, feet about shoulder width apart and lean back until your legs are horizontal, holding the rope above the knot and walk or bounce gently as your belaying partner lowers you. The only things that will cause a swing are- 

When skiing, if the weather is good, I often come back with a better tan than if I have been at the beach. Obviously with altitude, there is less blocking of UV rays by the atmosphere. But how much is blocked? Is there any guidance that says, "For every x thousand metres your exposure is doubled" or your sun factor should be increased by y? 

I first learnt snowboarding twenty years ago, when boards and bindings were rigid, the boards were long and asymmetrical, and back then carving was the way to turn. You'd lean right over (sometimes 75-80 degrees over) and the board would carve itself round a turn. Modern boards are much more flexible, and what your instructor means by twisting is that you actually do twist the board. You turn your front foot into the turn before your back foot. Look at this picture of a heelside turn: 

Jellyfish, while mobile, are not capable of much evasion. They can steer their bodies, but they are limited in their ability to get out of the way of a faster organism - which is why the majority rely on their stinging tentacles, and migration up to the surface and back down to follow food. One thing many jellyfish can do to avoid damage to themselves when they encounter a large animal (I.e. Too big to be prey) is to retract their tentacles and avoid stinging. So it is possible that you just weren't stung - or in fact that they weren't stinging jellyfish. As kids, we used to sail through vast shoals of jellyfish, and most of the ones around my home do not sting, so we used to catch them by hand and release them with no worry of getting hurt. 

Dyneema is the most hard wearing, however if you need it to run through any friction grip or clutch it is not a good choice as it is very smooth and shiny. Polyester really is the cost-effective, UV resistant and strong, especially when paired with a Dyneema core, so this is probably the way to go, although you could look at Cordura as an alternative. 

So in summary, you should use some common sense risk assessment. HSE reckons tree climbing should be avoided if possible, but if you need to then take precautions. For you, if you want to climb a tree, assess it: 

This will depend entirely on the type of boom and outhaul. If you have a simple straight through outhaul: 

While airflow does dry shoes, it is much less effective than physically wicking moisture away using towel, some or paper. Capillary action is very effective at removing water from anything, and wide fibre or coarse paper, such as newspaper, or better still, tissue or kitchen towel or swimmers' chamois are your best bet on the trail or after a wet hike. 

Having your muscles "pumped" is not a problem in itself. If you have problems with movement because of it, it is most likely down to muscle type, muscle mass, and cardiovascular effectiveness. Because I used to do a lot of weight lifting, my muscle mass is pretty high (which actually gives me a poor power to weight ratio for climbing) but as I do a lot of cardio training, having my muscles pumped up doesn't impact my climbing much at all. It usually only causes major problems if you are building up lactic acid in the muscles, which can happen because climbing can by quite anaerobic. The temporary fix is to stop, breathe and shake out your muscles, but the real way to combat this is to train your body to get better at flushing lactic acid. Which requires aerobic, cardiovascular exercise. So try running and cycling as well as your climbing. 

As all rucksacks and packs I own have areas of webbing on most sides, I tie up any long straps with multiple half-hitches onto the webbing, so I still have the full length of the straps - in case I need them - but have them safely out the way. 

The original meaning was the weight of the water displaced by the hull, but typically the hull weight is used to mean just the weight of the hull - minus fittings etc. Hopefully that helps solve your problem. 

I think this question is sufficiently similar to the other one that the answer will be identical. It isn't safe. Of course this company is taking risks, as all exploration companies do. There are many risks with camping or trekking in polar bear country. What you do is minimise the risks where possible, and accept the risks you can't minimise. As @Amine stated in their answer, carrying a gun is essential. I'm guessing standing watch or sleeping very light would be other useful habits! 

If she is actually allergic to sun then the only solution is to cover up, with clothes and sun screen. From Weather.com 

Telemark skiis are much more suitable for cross-country skiing than Alpine skis. Having the connection only at the front of the boot allows you to walk and cover long distances very efficiently across flat snow. But even in cross country-skiing, you will sometimes need to ski downhill, so the style of skiing with one dropped knee on corners was developed to allow for controllable steering. You can't easily ski normal downhill style with a free-floating heel. So people with Telemark skis will do this for practice, and for fun. 

A self erecting tent does exactly what it says. Typically it will be made in a way that the poles will naturally erect the tent so all you need to do is take it out of its bag and then peg it to the ground. The major downside is that taking it down requires some effort and technique to twist and fold it into its packed configuration. Typically they can't be made that big either, as the springy poles could get tangled in a complex configuration. We use them for the kids, for day tents or fun tents, but I wouldn't want one for proper camping. 

If they are in two pieces (hard shell and soft liner) then treat them separately, washing and drying the liner before putting it away in an airing cupboard or similar warm dry place. You want to clean the shell with clean water and a little soap, to get rid of grit, salt and other deposits, taking extra care to remove all dirt from clips and moving parts.Rinse and dry thoroughly. I store mine in my garage, on a shelf, in a boot bag to prevent insects or spiders making their home in them. The garage isn't heated, but this isn't generally an issue. Update as per Nisan's comment: Also go over the parts to make sure they are all there, functioning as designed, and properly tightened where they should be... It will save you the trouble of finding this out on the first trip next season And (and this may sound silly) always store them in the same place each time - it may sound OCD, but I have specific places for winter sports kit, summer sports kit, etc - so I don't need to worry about hunting round for them each season. 

The PLB is very much for highlighting to the emergency services that you are in an emergency situation and need a rescue. It can incur significant costs as the services are called out but gives a fairly accurate location so the search is short. One of your challenges here is that you may not know it is you they are looking for. Potentially the helicopters you hear could be working on something entirely unrelated. That said, if you feel it is a reasonable likelihood that they are searching for you, perhaps because you had a checkpoint you failed to call in and you know your contact will have raised the alarm, then not activating the PLB will incur costs as they continue to search. So activating the PLB will, in this scenario, reduce the cost and effort the emergency services need to expend - and I'd suggest that it makes sense to do this. It will also significantly improve their safety as they will not need to continue exploring - they will know where you are and can work out the most effective way to reach you.
