You might ask them if it's OK to follow-up in a year, and give them the option to call you before that if they realize the other job wasn't what they expected. Something like: 

I find that most companies appreciate honesty when they find it, so if you've really changed your mind about what it would take to make a move, go ahead and let them know this. I would not recommend a ruse or a lie, but if you can point to salary survey (or similar) to justify your new number then I think that's reasonable. After all, you can honestly say that you've just started thinking about it and didn't have a chance to fully consider things during that initial conversation. However, I think the larger problem you're going to have here is answering the "what are you looking for in your next position?", or "what kind of company attributes would convince you to make a move?". If your only answer is "piles of money", then that's a larger red flag than changing your desired salary number. 

I'm really worried about the way things went with my career. I've started computer science study by switching from a different field. 

I was so much into programming that I got my first job after my first semester. I was offered 120$ per month only. The boss was a really hard person. The money was even hardly covering the fuel expenses to reach office. So, I quit after 1 month. Boss was angry. Second job I got after some months, and I was offered about 250$ per month. I worked for 3 months and I was suddenly offered 900$/month from another company. The 250$ was covering only 10 days of month and remaining 20 days, I had to live on loan. The boss was good person but other job offer was only for immediate joining, I told boss and he said me that he can raise my salary to 400$/month. Other job salary was more than double and even the position was a lot better with a bit large team, so I quit, and the boss was angry as he had planned many other things for me to work on already. I joined the third company. Things were good but the bosses on top were not even IT guys, so they kept saying to do more and I really worked to keep them happy. Still I was happy. There were a couple of complaints from this company. First, there was no arrangement of food. There was so dirty and even toxic street food available in day time (and we had to pay our self, I was cool with it but bad food and hard work really?). Company was in a really bad location that there was no Govt control over food quality. I still kept going with constant complaint about food. It was summer and temperature started to raise up-to 40-45 degree Celsius. My office was on top of building say hello to sun all the time. I kept working sweat in heat under only a fan. But it became too much with time as they kept promising that air-conditioner will be installed next Monday. So, 4 Mondays passed, and no Air Conditioner. Bosses stopped to attend office because of heat, we started to receive instructions in email from bosses, but me and few more guy (Those also quit before me) had to keep working because of deadlines. So, after 4 Mondays I quit. I was becoming so much physically sick, that I had to quit suddenly, even I didn't go to receive my last month salary as they had said to work for 1 week more before leaving and there was no way I was going to sit in that hell for a another single moment. One more thing, they had promised to pay double for extra hour/day. They never paid a single peny for extra hour, even though there were always extra days and hours. Now I work as freelance developer for a nice small company in Canada. I make good money. 

Well if your response to the request from your senior was actually as curt as you describe it in the question then yes, I'd say that's pretty unprofessional. It's okay to express a preference for not doing certain types of task, actually refusing isn't often wise however. You don't specify your location but certainly in many places (e.g. US, UK) your employment contract will have a clause around "other duties as assigned" which is aimed to cover off additional tasks for the business that are not your primary job description (things such as admin). At this point it does sound like your team lead is asking you to do this rather than telling you so it's more a question of how you want to be seen by the lead (and by extension the organisation), are you the helpful, willing employee who wants to help the organisation get things done or are siloed "not my job" type? It's totally up to you and I'm not telling you to be one or the other but be aware of how these sort of actions are percieved (because in many ways perception == reality in the workplace) and don't be suprised if future "interesting" tasks or projects end up getting assigned to the employees who stepped up and took on a "boring" task previously. 

My aim was always to go to Europe/US/Canada to work as developer after finishing my study. Last month my degree completed and I got 2 Gold Medals in Computer Science and I already had won few small medals in past. The current company I work for as freelancer, is a small one and they can't offer me to join their office. Even though they like my work a lot. They even said me that they are looking into possibilities of taking me to their office but I don't they will be able to do so, as there are expenses and a lot of paperwork. So, now I'm able to see a lot of vacancies in countries I want that match my skills and offer relocation. But problem is experience. I worked: 1 month in first company, 3 months in second, 4 months in third, and for about 6 months I have been working as freelance. One more strange thing, I was the best in all companies, they loved my work, and the way I quit, they just hate me now. So I can't expect any feedback from past companies. How will I explain to new company recruiters the high quit frequency I had in past? I can't tell them stories like I did here, do I? Should I skip this in my experience section of CV/resume? Is it me who is bad? Any advice will be appreciated. 

What I would stress though is that there is no way you can make them give you the duties you expected (in this case the travel) so you need to decide how serious this is for you - from your post it sounds as if this was a large factor in you agreeing to take the job. So if it really is that important to you then before you talk to your boss I think you need to decide whether this is going to be a deal breaker for you. If it is then you need to be prepared to start quietly looking for a new role that will give you what you want. For what it's worth travelling for work is never as glamorous as it sounds - unless you are a fan of cheap hotels, overpriced "food" and long hours spent in airports it pretty much sucks. If you think a two-hour each way commute is a drag then believe me that has nothing on the time you lose traveling for work!
