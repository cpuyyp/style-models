(credit: NASA/ESA) Obviously the sun is reflected by the ocean, but the rough surface of the ocean scatters the light enough for no image to be formed. It would be the same if there were a planet being reflected: No detail would be visible. 

If this hypothesis is correct, the body from which 16 Psyche formed was a 500km planetesimal (about half the diameter of Ceres) It would have been destroyed in a collision with another body. The other body would have had to have been large enough (300km) to complete fragment the asteroid. The problem with this hypothesis is that no other pieces of this planetesimal have been found (they should still have similar orbits as Psyche). Another hypothesis is that Psyche suffered from a series of smaller impact, that fractured and disrupted the parent body, but did not destroy it. This would give Psyche a composition similar to the stony-iron mesosiderite meteorites. The Psyche mission is intended to answer these questions. 

A "space knife" is a non-starter: You can't cut a plasma with a knife because it behaves like a gas, not like a solid. You can't put anything into the sun or go anywhere near it because it is hot enough to vaporise anything. Any concept that involves "flying over the surface and scooping up hydrogen" is not going to work. Getting close to the sun is hard. You are orbiting the sun at 30km/s If you want to get close to the sun, you will need to slow down a lot that requires a lot of fuel. Then to get away from the sun you will need to speed up again. This takes a lot more fuel, far more than you could hope to gather from the sun. It is possible to collect some hydrogen without going anywhere near the sun. You can collect hydrogen and helium from the solar wind. The sun blows plasma off its surface and this could be collected using magnetic fields. This "wind" is not very dense: about 3-6 atoms per cm³. So you need to scoop a very large region for a long time to get a reasonable amount of gas. This gas is hot (36000 degrees) charged (its a plasma) and diffuse. 

After the moon has set, the sky is dark. There is a little "lunar twilight", but this is pretty insignificant. Once the moon has set you don't need to worry about the moon. The sky will be dark at midnight. 

A planetarium programme will tell you exactly where to look, and can be invaluable when looking for the location of planets, but the Moon is very easy to find in the sky, even after several glasses of Flanders Red Ale. So what you really want to know is a) is the eclipse visible from Belgium and b) roughly where in the sky will the moon be. This map shows that the Eclipse will be fully visible from Belgium. So that's good. The the Moon will be full (a lunar eclipse always happens at full moon) so the moon will rise in the East as the sun sets, and travel into the West. At Midnight (12 AM, but many people make that mistake) the Moon will be in the South, and at 4AM it will be South West, and quite low in the sky. But even eclipsed the moon hard to miss! Don't go out too early. Nothing much will be visible until the "Umbral eclipse" starts at 1:07 UTC (=3:07 am in Belgium) I wish you clear skies. 

We would use a clock. Actually, we don't use the position of the sun for determining time. The apparent position of the sun doesn't change with enough regularity. Events on the Earth, such as Earthquakes, can change the length of a "day". The spinning of the Earth is a good clock, but not the best. The best clocks use the frequency of light emitted by an atom (often a caesium atom). This frequency is very stable, far more stable than the Earth. If we were far from the sun, we could still use a clock to provide accurate timekeeping. The clock would record local time, which would not keep in sync with Earth time if the clock were moving relative to Earth, due to relativistic effects. Whether we would still use "days", "months", "years" etc is speculation. (and hence off topic) I'll note that our internal body clocks work best in a cycle of about 24 hours. 

In general relativity, gravity neither pushes nor pulls. To explain why ball travels in an arc you note the start and end points of the throw in 4d space time (3 space co-ordinates and 1 time coordinate) You then find the shortest path between these two 4d points in the curved spacetime surrounding the Earth. This shortest path is the path in spacetime that the ball travels. So in General relativity, gravity is not seen as being a force, instead it is the result objects travelling in the most direct way in a region of curved spacetime. However for nearly all practical purposes, the effect of gravity in relativity is amost identical to that produced by an attractive force, as supposed by Newton. 

Images that you see of nebulae show more intense colour than you could ever see with your eyes. Most nebulae are too dim to for our colour vision to be very active when looking at them. Cameras are designed to try and mimic human sight, to produce an image with colours that is close to what we would see. Telescopes are doing science and the colours are there to enhance features that we couldn't otherwise see. A telescope like Hubble will image a region at several wavelengths. Some of these wavelengths might be in the infrared or ultraviolet, beyond human sight. Then a colour is assigned to each wavelength, and the images are mixed. (See this description of how to achieve this with photoshop) This brings out details that would be lost in natural colour. Now there are two main reasons that dust and gas in a nebula might shine. One is that it is reflecting the light of nearby stars, the other is that it has been energised and is emitting its own light. Hydrogen gas will emit light with a red colour (in the right conditions), and some stars shine in blue-white light. If an emission nebula is next to a reflection nebula then you will get blue-on-red. A good example of this is the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius. As in this photo by Scott Rosen 

You are right in that, if you could send a message of any kind from inside a black hole then there is no magic required rebuild you from the information about you. If you could send even a single bit of information, then the black hole wouldn't be so black. You want to do this using the rotation of the black hole. This doesn't work, for various reasons. 

A star with absolute magnitude of -7 is big and powerful, It would be among the most powerful stars in the galaxy. The star would be near the end of its life, so comparing with other aging stars: Aldebaran is slightly more massive than the sun. It is a red giant (or orange giant according to some sources) It has an absolute magnitude of about -0.6. Aldebaran is too small to undergo a supernova. Betelgeuse is much bigger. Estimates of its mass put it at about 11 solar masses, but it could be bigger. It has a magnitude of about -6 (it is variable and there is some uncertainty on its distance). Eta Carinae is one of the most powerful stars in this part of the galaxy. It is also variable, but has an absolute magnitude of -8—-9, and mass of 100-200 suns AG Carinae is a LBV with a mass of 50 suns and a minimum absolute magnitude of about -8, but becoming much brighter during outbursts. (as bright as -11) So an evolved star with a magnitude of -7 could be supposed to be between the LBV stars and Betelgeuse, with a mass of around 15-20 suns. Stars do get very unstable this late in life, and there could be a great deal of uncertainty. Others here know more about supernovae mechanics, and may be able to explain any discrepancy between the supposed stellar mass, and the mass of the ejecta.
