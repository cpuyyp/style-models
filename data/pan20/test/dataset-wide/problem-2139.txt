When you work with a partner or spouse or child, you have be able to step back from that relationship at work. Treat her exactly as you would treat anyone else. If she has a complaint about your team, she gets the same professional courtesy as anyone who has a complaint. That means that you defend your team when the person complaining is wrong and correct the team when the person complaining is correct. What is critical to your relationship to the team is that you push back any unfair criticism. They will know, or should know, when the criticism is fair. When people perceive favoritism it is usually because the unfair stuff is passed through uncritically especially when you don't do that for anyone else. It is perceived as favoritism if her stuff always takes priority too, so watch out for that. You and your spouse need to have an agreement that you will push back things if, in your judgement, you do not think they are correct or they are not your highest priority. You are not married at work and your interests, being in different departments, are going to come into conflict at times. It is important that there be that conflict and that it be known publicly. 

It depends on the employees you have and what "you can go home when the work is done" means. If you have any marginal employees they will leave after 20 hours and never ask for more work. If you have good emplyees they will not go home if they know there is something else to be done that they can pick up that was not orginally assigned to them. Can you even define what "when your work is done" means (I personally have never had a job where there was no more work to do.) And is it fair to employees who always have work, if some others who are less valuable to the organization can alawys leave early because no one trusts them to do the work that is not yet done? I worked in a situation like that once and it created a lot of hate and discontent among the good workers althought he marginal were happy. Personally, I would not be willing to pay a full time salary to anyone who won't work full-time. So someone who leaves early occasionally, no problem. Someone who only works 20 hour weeks every week? If I keep them (which would be questionable, I have seen people fired for this and rightly so) I want them on part-time with a part-time salary. Someone who leaves after he is done his part when others are behind and he never asks for more work or lets the manager know he is done so he can be assigned more work to even out the workload? That would be unacceptable. Then how do you handle the employee who will only do more work if you insist she stays but the others are responsible and so you let them go? Personally I don't get why people think working the hours they are contracted to work is such a horrible imposition. 

This is an issue of organizational fit. They would reject anyone (male or female) who held these views because they are at odds with the mission of the company (they run seminars on this for goodness sake!). Your friend would not likely be happy in an organization where the culture is so far from his own views. And it is likely that the women who already work at such an organization would find his views offensive and it would make the current employees uncomfortable. Your friend needs to understand that there is far more than technical skills involved in choosing a person for a role. It is better to be honest when answering questions that relate to culture becasue being in a job where you don't fit the corporate culture is very painful. Both sides benefit by being able to filter out people who won't fit in before hiring. Let me give you some further examples. I work for a company that offshores much of the work. If you came to an interview at this company and told them that you think that offshoring is wrong, would you be surprised if they didn't hire you? This is the same situation. Your friend expressed a view that directly opposes the values and/or needs of the organization, he wasn't hired because of that and that was a good thing as he would not have fit in. Organizations have value structures too and when a candidate does not fit those values, the company has a right to not hire them. 

Since you are senior but not a manager or even a tech lead, this is definitely an awkward position. I would tend to believe that you should tell them the source of the bad news. SO yes, telling them that "John said to tell you that you need to start coming in by 8 am." is appropriate. That way if they have problem with it they know who to take it up with. I would suggest to you that perhaps your boss views you as either more of a tech lead than you think you are or is grooming you for a management position. In either event, it might be a good idea to discuss with him why he is asking you to do these tasks and how he would like to see it handled in terms of reporting back to him, etc. you might even use this as a way to get him to give you tech lead authority if you want it. A boss who wants to delegate all his difficult work away is often one where you can get assigned the tasks you need to be considered for higher roles in this or other organizations, so this is not entirely negative for you. (Although he is a jerk for only giving you the negative tasks.) I had a boss like this once and it really grew my skills so I could successfully apply for the next level up. Doing management tasks before you are offically a manager can be a good thing for your career. 

Is there one of your former colleagues that you did get along with well? Use that person as a reference. References do not have to be supervisors. This should help offset anything negative said about you in the employment verification part of the background check. You should put your actual supervisor's name on the form for background investigations, but when they ask for references, feel free to put down any former coworker. Be aware that in the US, they can terminate for no reason in most states. That means that they will not often give a reason because you cannot sue them for wrongful termination if they gave no reason. 

Generally when people do this to me, I send them an email asking them to put the issue in a separate email of it's own, so I won't lose track of that issue. Of course if it is large issue (basically anything that takes more than 15 minutes given how we track time), I request that they start a new project in our project mangement tracking system (which in our case also serves as a bug tracker, don't ask~!). It's amazing how many urgent, must-have issues go away when you tell people you won't work on it until they take the time to make it an official project. As long as you ask them politely (and consistently) to put their issue in a separate email or bug tracking system or project managment system and that you state that is it because you will be better able to fix their issue, I have never had someone refuse. They know that they are hijacking after all. Consistency is key though, if they know they can get away with hijacking sometimes, they will continue to do it. If they know you will always ask them to submit something separate, they will eventually stop hijacking. 

From there you might go on to discuss a particular time when you had to work with someone who was not a friend or who was even someone you personally disliked. 

I personally would suggest not counting temps who were intended to leave at a certain time as turnover. However, the person who would know what the company wants is the person who will be using the data. If he wants the temp data too, I can suggest that you provide figures in such a way that permanent employee turnover rates can be calculated separately from temps. One would expect temp rates to be higher, after all one presumes many temps leave for permanent postions somewhere else. That says nothing of how you are doing at retaining employees just that being a temp is not something most people want to be. 

Quiet might be optimal but it is not easy to come by in the workplace, so it is better to learn to concentrate no matter what is going on around you. Needing too quiet a workplace will reduce your employment prospects especially in this silly world where open offices have become popular (with senior management not withthe people who have to sit there). Will you be as productive as if you had a quiet space? No but senior management cares about things they can measure like office costs more than things they can't measure easily like developer productivity. You can however learn to be productive and to ignore noise. The first step is to simply let it flow past you. And once you get in the zone, a dragon roaring in your ears won't bother you. The trick is to get there and meditation techniques are the way. You learn to ignore distraction through meditation. You start by naming it in your mind "noise" then returning to task. It takes a lot of repetitions before you can easily dismiss noise, but it worth it to practice. 

Start with quality, quantity will come once the quality is there. Ask your boss for specific examples of things that you need to learn first. Then learn them. More importantly, retain what you learned. I have never worked with a good performer who had to look things up continually. Some things that aren't used very often, yes. But you can't improve your speed until you retain information and start to be able to use what you have learned in new situations. 

The answer is that it depends. First you need to assess if you have some experience that is a close analog to the experience they need such as an experienced Oracle dev might not get eliminated for a job that asks for SQL Server skills but someone with no database experience would if the skill is a large part of the job. Next you need to understand the relative importance of the skill given the job description. A position for a web developer who needs to be able to some database querying is far different from a job for a data scientist in terms of how much a company is going to be willing to invest in someone without the skill. Next you need to look at how many qualifications the job has. Those with a long laundry list of skills are less likely to require every single one of them. But you should have a good percentage of them and those you do have should be the ones most likely to be critical skills. Next you should assess whether the people with this skill set are going to be common. The usual stack for a C# or Java dev is a relatively common skill set and so there is little chance they would consider people without the usual skills because they will have plenty of people who have all the qualifications to choose from. Looking for work is a competition, if you know you won't be in the running, then there is little point in wasting everyone's time. Next you need to assess whether, you have some other skill that might mitigate the skill that is missing. For instance, if the job was in the health care industry where there are many regulations that you need to understand to create the software, then missing a technical skill may easily be made up for by having the business domain skill. So yes there are times when you can be missing some of the skills and still be considered. However, and it is a big however, your chances of being considered are significantly lower than if you had what they are asking for. If you are not even close, your resume will likely never even be read by a human being as many are filtered through automated systems. So don't get your hopes up when applying out of your qualification level. Another thing to understand is that years of experience counts in at least a general way. I might look at someone with 2.5 years of experience when I need 3 but probably not at an entry level person. Companies do not hire potential except at entry level and they do not hire entry level people for jobs that are beyond the entry level unless it is a really bad company. If the job requires 5 years of experience and you have none, it is likely a job that you will not be able to do and if the company hires you, then they will stress you out because you can't deliver. Read some of the questions about people who took jobs at startups that should have needed experienced devs and they hired entry level instead and this person straight out of college was expected to perform tasks that might have been daunting for an experienced person. If the job needs a certain level of experience and the people with that experience won't touch it, then there is something wrong. You don't want to be so far out of your skill level that you can't do the work. It's bad for your health and well-being and it is bad for your career. So my advice to you is to stop dreaming about jobs you would love to have and concentrate on the ones you can do with just a little bit of stretch (always try to have some room to grow in a new position) and getting the solid experience you need to get to that dream job later. In five to ten years you will be able to do the more exciting things and do them successfully rather than failing miserably now because you tried to do something you were no qualified to do. 

If you are going to work for a small, privately-held business, you need to accept that there will always be people with a personal relationship to the owner who will get preferential treatment. If you don't like that, then work for larger businesses that do not allow nepotism. In one place where I worked the president's cousin got a free car that none of us got. In others they got preference in promotions, the ability to take time off beyond the official leave they got, or their lunch bought by the company every day. Often they get positions they are not qualified to hold. This is just one of the normal parts of working for a small business. Rewarding family members is one of the perks of owning a business. But truly, no workplace is fair to everyone all the time and you will drive yourself crazy worrying about whether someone else is getting more than you. Someone else always is. In the long run look for a place where the conditions you accepted are fine with you and don't worry about whether someone else got a better deal. You probably get a better deal on something than someone else too, how often do you worry about that?
