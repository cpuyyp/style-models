I can show that it is impossible to achieve $H=SU(n)$. More generally, if $G$ is a compact connected Lie group, I will show that the map $U \mapsto P_1 U P_2 U \cdots P_m U$ is surjective, and therefore the preimage of the identity can't be all of $G$. Proof Such a $G$ is a compact connected orientable manifold so we can talk about the degree of self-maps of $G$. If $\phi: G \to G$ is a continuous function which misses a point, then $\phi$ has degree $0$. We will compute the degree of $U \mapsto P_1 U P_2 U \cdots P_m U$ and see that it is nonzero. Since $G$ is connected, $U \mapsto P_1 U P_2 U \cdots P_m U$ is homotopic to $U \mapsto U^m$. A generic matrix in $SU(n)$ has $m^{n-1}$ many $m$-th roots in $SU(n)$ (and $m^n$ many $m$-th roots in $U(n)$). At some point in my life, I worked out that all of these $m$-th roots contribute to the degree with the same sign. More generally, let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group of rank $r$ (meaning that maximal torii have degree $r$). For a generic element $x$ of $G$, there is a unique maximal torus $T$ containing $x$ and all $m$-th roots of $x$ are in that torus; there are $m^r$ of them. For our purpose, the only important fact is that $m^r \neq 0$, so $U \mapsto U^m$ has nonzero degree and $U \mapsto P_1 U P_2 U \cdots P_m U$ must be surjective. $\square$ ADDED Robert Bryant proves that, if $G$ is a compact connected Lie subgroup and $T$ is a connected subgroup so that $P_1 U P_2 U \cdots P_m U=1$ for $U \in T$, then $T$ is contained in a maximal torus. The point of this edit is to point out that, if $G$ is semisimple, and $T$ is any maximal torus, then there are $P_i$ which achieve this. Robert Bryant already does this for $SU(n)$ in his answer. Let $N(T)$ be the normalizer of $T$, so we have a short exact sequence $1 \to T \to N(T) \to W \to 1$, where $W$ is the Weyl group. Let $c$ be any element of the Weyl group which acts with no eigenvalues of $1$ on the Lie algebra of $T$ (for example, a Coxeter element) and let $h$ be the order of $c$. Let $P_1$ be a lift of $c$ to $N(T)$. Let $P_1^h = z$ (an element of $T$). Set $P_1=P_2 = \cdots = P_{h-1}$ and $P_h = P_1 z^{-1}$. Then I compute $\def\Ad{\mathrm{Ad}}$ $$P_1 \exp(t) P_1 \exp(t) \cdots P_1 \exp(t) P_1 z^{-1} \exp(t) = \exp\left( (\Ad(P_1) + \Ad(P_1)^1 + \cdots + \Ad(P_1)^h ) t \right) P_1^h z^{-1} = \exp(0) \cdot 1.$$ 

Note that we cannot give a single polynomial $R(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i)$ which vanishes if and only if the equations have a common root, because the property of these equations having a common root is not closed. For example, for all $\epsilon \neq 0$, the equations $y=0$, $y+\epsilon x=1$ and $y+2\epsilon x = 2$ have a common root at $(0, 1/\epsilon)$, but the equations $y=0$, $y=1$, $y=2$, obtained in the limit as $\epsilon \to 0$, have no common root. Note that this also shows that no list of equations could do the job. In general, a constructible set is a subset of an algebraically closed field formed from finitely many polynomial equalities and the boolean connectors AND, OR and NOT. For example, the set $$\{ (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,x,y) : ax+by+c=dx+ey+f=gx+hy+i=0 \}.$$ A theorem of Chevalley says that the projection of a constructible set onto a subset of its coordinates is again constructible. So the projection of the above set onto the $(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i)$ coordinates must be an constructible set, and I've given a boolean description above. 

I think, for the reasons Jose points out, that you should err on the side of numbering more. In particular, an equation which you refer to more than a line or two after it appears should probably be numbered. I've also found this makes editing easier: If you insert a new paragraph, with several equations in it, you don't need to look for all of the references you've broken. I agree with you, though, that it never would have occurred to me that "above" couldn't refer to a line on a previous page. Perhaps this is a difference between those of us who read on screens, with our scroll bars, and those who page through print outs? 

The problem as stated is unsolvable in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients with $f(a)$ a prime power. Proof: Let $a=0$, let $f(0) = p^n$ and let the coefficient of $x$ in $f$ not be divisible by $p$. Then $p(0)$, $q(0)$, $r(0)$ and $r(0)$ are all of the form $\pm p^k$, and the hypotheses forbid that $k=0$. So all of the constant terms of $p(x)$, $q(x)$, $r(x)$ and $s(x)$ are divisible by $p$. But then the linear term of $f(x) = (p(x)q(x)+r(x)s(x))/2$ is divisible by $p$ as well, a contradiction. $\square$ 

This is may be obvious, but I am not comfortable with ind-schemes. I have an ind-scheme $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Every point has a neighborhood which can be written as an ascending union of regular varieties, which is about as smooth as an ind-scheme can be. I have an unipotent ind-group $U$. More precisely, $U$ is a group object in the category of ind-schemes, and $U$ has a descending filtration all of whose quotients are $\mathbb{G}_a$'s. The group $U$ acts freely on $X$. There is a quasi-projective variety $Y$, and a map $f: X \to Y$, which is a principal $U$-bundle. (Meaning that there is a cover $Y = \bigcup V_i$ and $f^{-1}(V_i)$ is isomorphic to $U \times V_i$.) 

We start in the case $n = p^r$ for $p$ odd. Let $\mathbb{Z}_p$ be the $p$-adic integers and let $H_p := H \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$. We will start by showing that the number of index $p^{2r}$ ideals in $H_p$ is $p^r+p^{r-1} + \cdots + p+1$. We then check that all of those ideals contain $p^r H$, so this is also the number of ideals in $H/p^r H$. The point is that $H_p \cong \mathrm{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ (again, for $p$ odd). By a standard pigeon hole argument, we can find $u$ and $v$ with $u^2+v^2 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod p$; by Hensel's lemma, we can find $u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $u^2+v^2+1=0$. Let $$I = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad J = \begin{pmatrix} u & v \\ v & -u \end{pmatrix} \quad K = \begin{pmatrix} v & -u \\ -u & -v \end{pmatrix}.$$ Then $I$, $J$ and $K$ obey the quaternion relations, and we get a map $H_p \to \mathrm{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. We claim that this map is bijective. It is a map between two free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-modules of rank four, so we just need to check that the determinant of this map is a unit of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. This determinant is $-4(u^2+v^2)=4$. Since $p$ is odd, we are fine. So, set $E_p := \mathrm{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Let's count index $p^{2r}$ right ideals $E_p$. Let $M$ be the $E_p$-module $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$. As a module over itself, $E_p \cong M^{\oplus 2}$. Right ideals is another word for submodules, so we want to count index $p^{2r}$ submodules of $M^{\oplus 2}$. Since $E_p$ is Morita equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we know that $E_p$ submodules of $M^{\oplus 2}$ are in bijection with $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodules of $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\oplus 2}$. A quick check shows that being index $p^{2r}$ in $M^{\oplus 2r}$ corresponds to being index $p^r$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\oplus 2}$. Moreover, every index $p^r$ submodule of $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\oplus 2}$ is contained in $p^r \mathbb{Z}_p^{\oplus 2}$, so every index $p^{2r}$ submodule of $M^{\oplus 2}$ is contained in $p^r M^{\oplus 2}$, fulfilling an earlier promise, and allowing us to shift our attention to the finite problem of counting index $p^r$ submodules in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)^{\oplus 2}$. We are reduced to showing that the number of index $p^r$ submodules of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)^{\oplus 2}$ is $p^r + p^{r-1} + \cdots p+1$. Proof by induction on $r$. Let $N$ be such a submodule. There are two cases: (1) $N$ is not contained in $p (\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, $N$ is generated by a single element. The number of elements of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)^{\oplus 2}$ which generate a submodule of index $p^r$ is $p^{2r} - p^{2r-2}$. Two such elements give the same submodule if their ratio is a unit of $\mathbb{Z}/p^r$; the number of such units is $p^r-p^{r-1}$. So the number of $N$ in this case is $(p^{2r}-p^{2r-2})/(p^r - p^{r-1}) = p^r+p^{r-1}$. (2) $N$ is contained in $p (\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 2}$. In this case, $N$ is an index $p^{r-2}$ submodule of $p (\mathbb{Z}/p^r \mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 2} \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p^{r-1} \mathbb{Z})^{\oplus 2}$. By induction, the number of options for such an $r$ is $p^{r-2} + p^{r-3} + \cdots p+1$. Adding the two cases together, we are done.
