Walking is the most natural movement a human can do. Therefore it's no problem to walk for long distances. Running however, is different. Although we can do it for long distances (+10km), it is not the best thing to do for serveral reasons: 

However it's a good thing that your kid wants to go for a run so embrace it. Just do it in reasonable amounts... 

In my experience I would say none. A tennis elbow is an inflammotory injury of your tendon that needs to rest. Keep it could and make shure you rest enough. You could also take a five day cure of an inflammation blocker while you are resting. If you will not rest with this injury, it will only become worse... 

Drinking less water is not an option because of the intense sweating when hiking for 9 hours or so under the hot sun. An obvious choice was to replace water with sports drink like Gatorade. Firstly, I don't like sports drink. Secondly, I want to know what is the exact thing my body lost with excessive sweating and needed to be put back into my body. I am not a chemist/biologist, but from what I read, the term electrolyte is loosely used to refer to a group of minerals. Sodium, potassium, calcium and more. 

After I have relaxed the back muscle, I will be able to continue walking pain-free, for a short period of time. Say I am not feeling any back pain now, if I walk for 2 hours non-stop, the back pain will appear, and I will try to find a place and sit down and relax, then I will be able to walk another 40 mins without pain and it will start to come back. If I sit down, rest and relax a bit, then I will be able to walk without pain for maybe another 15 mins. The thing that bugs me is when I hike, which is similar to walking, for 8 hours. There is no sign of back pain. I was guess maybe the posture is key, when hiking I tend to lean forward. However I am totally clueless what am I experiencing and if what the doctor said is 100% accurate. I would really appreciate it if somebody can share their thoughts, or if they have been in a similar situation before, to share their experience. This is very annoying, but not so much that I felt I am hurting my body. It does feel very very sore and mildly painful when I walk way too much, and my back would be so stiff that I need 10 to 15 mins just to relax deeply to loosen all muscles. However I think it is a condition that I want to understand more about and try to train my body to overcome it if it can be improved by muscle strengthening / loosing weight. I am 100kg at 189cm (6'2"), age 26 male. I am overweight, but I came from being obese (BMI 31) one year ago. I have trained very hard and I have shredded 17 kg off me. Any input will be greatly appreciated, thank you. 

It could be an anti-catabolic cassein protein that is combined with other stimulating ingredients like creatine, caffein, etc. But I would not advice you to eat right before a workout. It's not natural and your digestive system takes away a lot of your energy. As long as you don't post the full ingredient list I can not give you a full and correct explenation for your question. 

If you're a programmer that means you're sitting most of the time. This implicates that the muscles of your backline are overstretched constantly and the muscles of your front line are over tensed. This outs in an aching pain in the lower part of your back. Your orthopedists are right. You can fix this with exercise. BUT And this is a great but. Fixing this kind of problem is not easy. You should really talk to a good personal trainer. Conventional fitness exercises just don't cut it and can make your injury even worse. If you do the wrong exercises the situation of imbalanced tension between your frontal and back muscle chains will even get worse. I strongly recommend you NOT to do any conventional abs exercises like set-up, cruch, ... . This is an advice given by people who follow convenional wisdom. This will make your injury even worse! You should not do any intensive sports before your problem is fixed. If you really want to sport before your problem is fixed then I advice you to go for a swim. You should do exercises that stretch/open your frontal muscle chains and relax your back muscle chains. That way the tension in your back will dissapear. It's hard to do this with conventional exercise so forget training on endurance, with weights, ... A good personal trainer should know how to handle your problem. Once you start training you should already see improvement after a few trainings. 

When I have this weird back pain, it is like a fatigue muscle is in need of some deep relaxation. There is something I can do to relief this pain, most of them requires me to sit down, however if it is severe my back will feel very very stiff, I will only be able to sit at a very up-right position. There are a few things that I can do to relief my back: 

But then, I am only getting sodium and potassium. Hikers recommend bringing complex carbohydrates and eating them frequently to fuel muscles. I don't think complex carbs like wheat biscuits provide minerals when digested. They give a steady supply of sugar when digested, but sugar and carbs have nothing to do with body electrolyte balance. 

Like Tsvetan says, you can't cure tireness. BUT you can cure the stress you get from work type stuff... My advice to you is to put some PLAY in your training. Make it fun. Don't just do boring routine repetitive movements, but try to add some game characterestics to it. Winning should not be your main goal here. PLAY itself is. It brings your MIND & BODY in the here and now. This relieves your body from the stress you bring home from work. After a training of play you will feel a lot different and more relaxed. I do this kind of training when my clients are to stressed out for a normal personal training session and it works very good. If you want more info on how to put more play in your usual training methods take a look at these names on the web: -Frank Forencich -Mark Sisson -Erwan Le Corre -Ian O'Dwyer -PTaGlobal Play Another option is running a 3km run barefoot. This also takes your mind completely of work for some time because you have to be 100% alert for sharp rocks and stuff. It also improves your running technique so that's two for the price of one if you ask me :) 

When I cough, I feel a mild pain in my lower back and hip area. (behind my belly button and in my glute) I went to the doctor and he told me I have inflammation in a part of my spinal cord. It is reacting to pressure. Sudden expansion and contraction (like when coughing) will pressure the spinal cord and this will press against the swollen nerves and I will feel pain. The pain is not sharp, it feels more like muscle pain after exertion than being poked by a needle. The doctor gave me some anti-inflammatory pills and he sent me away. I did get better, but it keeps coming back. I found out that certain activities will encourage my back pain to develop. Once developed, it will take many nights worth of high quality sleep to recover. Here are the things that seem to cause back pain, or worsen it: 

I would really recommend you these DVD's. I bought them myself and they are very usefull. You can get a lot of new Ideas from them and they are prety cheap so... Watch these trailer: $URL$ $URL$ 

In my opinion 100% barefoot is still the way to go. It's the most natural way as well. The only good reason to run with Vibrams is temperature. Running 100% barefoot is better for your running posture. You start using your hips to absorbe shoques. This implicates that you will not constantely burden your achilles tendon by running on your front foot like you do when you weir the Vibrams or any other minimalistic shoe. The Idea is good but the protection from the rubber sole makes your foot unroll different and that influences your running posture. I use the Vibrams too. A lot. But I try not to run with them and go as much 100% barefoot as I can. I use the Vibram mostely during PT sessions. If I had to choose from the ones you showed I would take the Bikila's. 

I have read on various places that exercising for a prolonged period of time with excessive water intake can be dangerous. It may lead to water intoxication (hyponatremia). After some searches and a few more articles, it seems that: 

I weight 105kg and I am 6'2 (189cm), I drank around 5 litres of water in a 7 to 9 hours day-hike. I had some biscuits and 3 bananas, and 1.2 out of the 5 litres of fluid I had was sports drink. However by the end of the hike I was feeling a slight headache. Was it because I was drinking too much water? I want to find out what the body looses with excessive sweating, and what are the ways to eat/drink accordingly to replenish the lost substances.
