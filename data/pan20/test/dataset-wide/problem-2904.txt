Really comes down to arguments for or against a unified Theory of Everything. If there is a ToE explaining the whole universe, then we should expect all of our measurements to be consistent. If there is no ToE, then there is no reasons why different scientific theories - having different domains of application - need to be consistent with each other. There is a lot to debate in this question, but here are a couple of considerations: 

Different people have objected to philosophy at different times. The Persian theologist Al Ghazali in the 11th~12th century wrote at treatise called "The incoherence of the philosophers". In it he showed that philosophers' attempts to prove God's existence with logic failed. Since he wasn't willing to give up religion, he attacked philosophy instead. His main objection was therefore religious. In the early 20th century (as mentioned in the comments), the logical positivists objected to philosophy coming from the opposite direction. Their position was that the only meaningful statements that could be made were logical propositions and empirical facts about that world. Any statement that either couldn't be verified experimentally or did not correspond to a logical/mathematical statement was for them meaningless. From this they concluded that statements about ethics, morals, religion, arts, etc... were all meaningless. They didn't reject philosophy completely, but instead relegated it to being nothing more that a tool for the clarification and analysis of scientific statements. Their objection wasn't to philosophy as a whole, but to metaphysics, which up until then was considered a major sub-discipline of philosophy. More recently several notable physicists, including Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Stephen Hawking, and Lawrence Krauss, have made statements as to philosophy being useless or obsolete. Their main statement is that natural sciences have matured to the point were all of the big questions (the origin of life, the creation of the universe, etc...) can be answered by science. Philosophy used to be helpful in guiding the natural sciences by giving direction and pointing to what questions we should be asking, but now the natural sciences no longer need it. They support their argument by pointing towards the fact that philosophy no longer influences physics the way it used to in the 17th and 18th centuries, and that most scientists can have successful careers without ever opening a single philosophy book or journal. Lawrence Krauss has a more detailed version of this position (which is really just a dumbed down version of the logical positivist stance called scientism), that science is the only source of objective truth and the scientific method is the only valid epistemic method. Those who object to these viewpoints do so for the following reasons: 

(This my own answer, not based on sources. I apologize for publishing it as an answer, but it is too long for comments.) You are correct in invoking Mill's harm principle, but you are looking at the question backwards. I will try to explain this by analogy: Per Mill's harm principle, the publication and broadcasting of pornography is restricted and not allowed in mainstream media that can be viewed by minors. It is however allowed in specialized pornographic media and in age restricted publications and programs. As such pornography is protected by freedom of speech, but it's publication is restricted to protect minors from harm, and you can be arrested for showing a movie or a book with explicit sexual acts in an inappropriate venue - freedom of speech not withstanding. Similarly in your holocaust denial example, it is not that discussion of the topic is not protected by freedom of speech, it is. But, in the name of protecting people from hate speech and bigotry, whoever wants to deny the historical facts of holocaust has to clearly label it as scholarly research (as opposed to regular journalism or political writing), in the same way that the adult industry has to clearly label its products so that parents can protect their children from it. 

A superstitious person will view this as definitive evidence of some other-worldy forces trying to tell me something. A rational person will conclude that someone managed, against all odds, to play some elaborate prank on me, as unlikely as it is that someone could ever rig the ketchup and the floor to form such a pattern. Neither of them would for one second entertain the possibility that this was a pure coincidence. And yet it is still physically possible, all though the chances are infinitesimally small, that somehow the ketchup just happened to fall in exactly that pattern. Why is this the case? Why would one be certain that some agency is involved? I am trying to figure out the relationship with skepticism here: Why is radical skepticism acceptable in so many other epistemic scenarios (Does external reality exist? do other people have minds or are they just zombies? etc,...), but in this case we would be certain that it is not a coincidence, that some agent was behind the occurrence? More over, I could be certain in real life that no matter how many times I spill Ketchup on the floor, I will never get the above mentioned pattern (unless some trickery is involved). What is the grounds for such certainty? 

In this video (starting around 00:28:30) the interviewer, Bryan Magee, and Noam Chomsky discuss musical composition as a form of thinking without language. But it seems trivial to me that music is a language like any other: a set of sound symbols with a corresponding written notation and grammar-like rules. It wouldn't be a stretch at all to imagine that meaning can be associated with fundamental chords and melodies and then music will be no different than English or Chinese. What am I missing? Why do Magee and Chomsky consider music to be proof of thinking without language? 

Recently, The Atlantic published an article claiming that "Google Taught an AI That Sorts Cat Photos to Analyze DNA". When you look at the original paper published by the Google team, what they really did was take a neural network model normally used for image classification and apply it to classifying DNA data instead (see also this debunking of The Atlantic's article). From one point of view you can claim that they used "an AI" to analyze DNA data, from another they just applied a more advanced mathematical model than the previously used ones (universal approximators vs. parametric models). This begs the question: Assuming that the computational theory of mind and functionalism are true, is there a way of discriminating algorithms that are just software and mathematical models from algorithms that qualify as AI? One straight up answer to this is obvious: It's an AI if it passes the Turing test (or some modern more advanced variation of it), otherwise it is just software. But beyond the Turing test there seems to be another issue with The Atlantic's article: To say that "an AI" did this or that implies that the neural network they used had some level of agency or autonomy, when in fact it was a completely inert program that starts and stops based on a set of pre-defined parameters and instructions. The same applies to Amazon's Alexa: It doesn't respond to any communication unless someone prefaces their sentence with the word "Alexa". It never starts communicating on its own or spontaneously inserts itself into a conversation. My questions: 

On the difference between the top-down approach (from SP to PP) vs the bottom-up approach (from PP to SP), what is at play here is not whether one approach is reductionist and the other isn't, as I mentioned above, they are both reductionist. Instead what is at play here is the logic of discovery used: 

"Collectivism" isn't synonymous with "Communism" or "Socialism" nor is it antynomous with "Capitalism" - all of which are economic systems. On the other hand "Collectivism" would be a stance on human rights, ethics and social norms, and should be contrasted with "Libertarianism" or with "Individualism", not with the above mentioned economic systems. From this point of view both Soviet style communism, and excessive forms of capitalism where large corporate interest impose lifestyle and economic choices on hapless individuals are both collectivist - whether the entity doing the coercion is a government actor or a private corporate interest doesn't really matter. In fact many leftists and socialist thinkers saw themselves as opposing the collectivism imposed by capitalism. Marx for example saw the division of labor as a limitation of freedom imposed by the capitalist mode of production: Capitalism force people to be either doctors, or bus drivers, or coal miners, or musicians, etc...whereas in a communist society people would be free to engage in whichever activities they please. In the The German Ideology (1845) he states that:
