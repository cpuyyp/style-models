You don't. Unless you're applying for a job with some sort of extremely high security clearance - no interviewer, hiring manager, or HR person is going to care. In my (considerably) shorter CV, I say: 

I can only speak of UK Unions which are noticeably different from Unions in the USA. Firstly, understand that you will never agree 100% with anyone. I'm sure Barack Obama doesn't agree with every single thing his party does. It's worth determining if this is a fight worth having - or whether you just disagree with the colour they've painted the bikesheds? Accepting the seriousness of your accusations, the second thing you must understand is that unions are made up of their members. You should look at the rules under which they are governed. It may be as simple as you writing a motion to be voted on - or as complicated as requiring 2/3rds of quorate members the agree to raise a motion to be voted on by the executive committee. Talk to your local rep (or US equivalent) and see what it is you need to do. Don't start by being confrontational - ask what the situation is and whether it is something you can reasonably change. Once you are in full command of the facts, you will be able to rally others to your cause. Unions - and all democratic institutions - rely on active members. It may take only a few dozen of you voting in order to make a substantial change. 

This depends heavily on your country and industry. Generally speaking, recruiters are paid on commission. That means, they get paid a percentage of your salary when they place you in a job*. It may be that, in your case, they get paid a lower amount for placing a contractor than they do for a Full Time Employee. You should do what you think is best for yourself - not what's best for them. Personally, I've never heard of anyone having a problem switching between contracting and full-time. My advice? If you really want to start contracting, find a new agency - preferably one which specialises in the way you want to work. *It can be more complicated than that - sometimes they're paid a flat fee + a percentage, sometimes a percentage after you've been there X months etc. 

Ultimately, you need to find what makes that team tick. Is it a box of chocolates to say thanks? Is it a mention in the weekly newsletter? Is it a chewing out from the boss? 

I'm sorry to say, it sounds like you should accept this rejection. When I set coding tests, it's because I want to see whether a candidate has a good enough working knowledge of a language. I want to see whether they understand the standards and pitfalls of the language. I want to see that I won't have to spend too much time teaching them the basics. You spent 2 days learning C++. Here's what I would do if I were you: 

Remember, the person hiring you is looking for evidence of your skills, what you're like to work with, how you approach problem solving. If you have a form that specifically asks for the exact date - I think it's perfectly acceptable to put the first of the month if you don't know. 

Your "official" job title is really only relevant inside your employer. If I put down on my CV that I was a "Grade 7 Product Manager - SPMI" no one outside of one specific employer would understand what it meant. Instead, I put something similar to "Mobile Website Manager". That way, the person reading the CV knows not to skip over the description of what I did. The only (minor) downside is that when an employer asks your previous employer for a reference, they may come back saying "Alice was employed as an ABC between date X and date Y." I've never had that be a problem. By and large, the UK web industry isn't very bureaucratic. A minor discrepancy over a job title isn't going to cause any problems. That being said.... 

It's about building foundations. Once you have A-Levels, no one cares about GCSEs. Once you have a degree, no one cares about A-Levels. Once you've had good job or two, no one cares about your degree. Right now, your foundations feel like they're built on sand. That's why you feel uneasy and are looking for stability. First things first - it's not as bad as all that! A 2.2 is fine - no, you're not going to get into the Civil Service Fast Stream, but it's not like the whole world is shut away from you. References are mostly a formality. What you need is a network of people you can ask for advice. I've also jumped from job to job. I spin it as "a wide variety of experience". Yeah - you don't have 5+ years of learning something in depth. But you've got experience in a variety of industries, workplaces, and people. So - how to improve on this? 

Self Recording. That is, the person has an aim of running X mentoring sessions with Y members of staff - and they simply records the number that they did. Feedback. Implement a feedback system (even a Google Doc or email will do) and have the Measurable as "I will receive feedback from 3 junior staff members. The average score for my performance will be 7 / 10" 

These are not your computers. They are owned and run by someone else. If that person doesn't want you to play Minecraft on there - that's tough. Their house, their rules. I would absolutely encourage you to explore, innovate, and hack - but only on machines where you have permission to do so. Otherwise, you face the very real risk of being punished. Whether you're at work or school, doesn't matter. Ok, now, how do we deal with a network administrator who is an idiot. Well, first, is he? Are you sure that the Linux ISO you downloaded wasn't corrupted in some way? Did you check the MD5 sums against the download page? Did you make sure the machine you used to burn the disc didn't have a virus? Was anyone else using the machine but you? Can you prove it? It is never a smart idea to tell someone they are wrong. People can react badly when you demonstrate that they are idiots. So, here's what I think you should do. 

If you're applying to work as a chef, the number of app downloads you've got is irrelevant. If your internship is with a software house then, yes, putting down some hard numbers is a good idea. The next question is - are they impressive? 1,500 API requests doesn't sound impressive. You could do that in an afternoon of idly clicking your mouse. Try saying something like... 

I've worked for start-ups which haven't paid me on time. Sadly, all you can do is remind them of the contract and let them know you won't be working until you've been properly paid. If the client is unwilling to sign a formal contract, you have to assume that they can't afford to honour their agreements. 

Yes, it is entirely appropriate. If time really is of the essence, it won't hurt to call rather than email. I've had both calls and emails from people who were interested in a job for which I was recruiting. I'd much rather have someone clarify things before an interview. All CVs nowadays are submitted either online or via email - so you shouldn't worry about the postal service. Judging from your date format and use of the word "CV", I assume you're in the UK? Generally speaking, industry references come after you accept the role. So no need to worry about a reference letter just yet. The bigger concern to me is that you want to leave in 6 months. Depending on the job, up to 3 months is a common notice period. It would be worth clarifying with the hiring manager whether that's an acceptable timeframe for them before formally applying. 

Assume that the person reading your CV doesn't know the specifics of the qualification. Is an 85% pass on an exam good or bad? Put in some detail to help them understand. Similarly, they probably won't be familiar with your school's MSc marking scheme (especially true if you're applying to foreign institutions). So, try explaining why the grade is so good. For example: 

I've been lucky enough that I've accrued enough airmiles from company travel to part-fund my personal travel. I've also bought ~£300 worth of catering from Sainsbury's and pocketed the Nectar points. Nearly enough to buy my lunch the next day :-) Now, there is an ethical dimension to this. You probably have a duty to your employer to buy the best value goods possible. If the good your bought from Homebase were twice as expensive as B&Q - or the flight was more expensive on BA than Virgin - you're not behaving ethically. If the only reason you bought the more expensive version was so that you could personally profit - that is unethical behaviour. Will you get disciplined for it? Probably not, but that depends on your company. Keep the receipt, show that you bought the best value goods and you should be fine. Enjoy your Nectar points :-) 

There are specific laws in the UK regarding the number of (functional) toilets a workplace should have. $URL$ I would suggest that you need to talk to your boss and explain to her that it is impractical to work in an environment without loos. Possible solutions are 

No. Depending on where you are in the world it's illegal to discriminate on age. Most (sensible) people care about talent and potential. Not really. People change careers all the time. If you switched from being a pig farmer to a app developer, it might be a little unusual - but going from one high-tech industry to another isn't strange. 

If not, leave it off. Never assume that the person reading your CV will understand your qualifications. Even if you've completed a basic "First Aid" course, explain briefly what you did and why you consider it important to the role. 

How would you feel if your romantic partner signed up to a dating site, or kept their OKCupid profile regularly updated? I'm not saying it's logical - or especially fair - but that's how lots of companies feel about their employees. They show loyalty to you while you're happily promiscuous. Some managers realise that the old days of company loyalty are dead - in your case, your manager doesn't. Your manager spent a lot of time (and probably a lot of money) hiring you. On a rational level, they don't want to make that expenditure again. On an emotional level, they don't want to admit to their peers that they made a bad hire. Realistically, all you can do is explain your career plans to them. Let them know how much you enjoy working for the company but - assuming they don't offer any loyalty bonuses - you don't feel beholden to them. 

But for web development? No one cares about titles - they care about skill, experience, and potential. In your specific instance, I'd say something like "Intern Web Developer" or "Web Developer - Placement Year (ABC)" 

You should, where possible, be precise. For example, put "£19.15 per hour / 45 hours per week." If it is just asking for your annual equivalent salary, you should calculate it based on what you have been paid. For example, if over the last month you worked 150 hours and were paid £19.15/hour - your annual salary would be £34,500. 

Explain why this work is important. If you're saying "Can I have the sales data for 2013" that's not nearly as important as "The CEO needs to report some figures to the board. Can we get the XYZ so that we can show investors how well we're doing." Praise them. An email to their boss, copying them in, saying "I just want to thank the team for XYZ. It really made a difference and ..." The nuclear option. Complain. Raise this with your manager and get them to talk to their manager. 

Have the prospective employee fill in an online form. This way you only get the information for which you asked. The downside is, employees generally hate filling these in. HR should screen the CVs and "blank out" any information which is inappropriate. For example, removing photos, gender, date of birth etc. The downside is that you need an HR department - or an employee who understands the law and isn't part of the hiring decision. It may also be obvious to the hiring manager that a part of the CV has been removed. 

You're given a chance to impress the recruiter with what you know about them, why you want to work with them specifically, and what you can bring to the table. In your situation - I think it's fair that you interview them. Tell them that you want to understand what they do and what they have to offer you. 

Ultimately, it's more professional to speak to your boss and see how she wants to handle it. You're going to upset people by leaving - that's inevitable - but there's no need to make it painful. 

Yes. Their interview, their rules. They haven't broken any law, although it may make you feel uncomfortable. 

If you've tried all of the above, I'd say you'd made a good faith attempt at contacting the recruiter. If the hiring manager gave you his card, I would say that was an invitation to contact him. Don't interrupt his day with a phone call - drop a short, professional email explaining that you're eager to hear back from the interview. Explain that you're contacting them directly because the recruiter isn't contactable. Usually, it's not acceptable to go around a recruiter. In this case, as the recruiter is non-responsive, I think it's acceptable to go direct. 

In a word, yes. Most UK companies will have a clause in their contract with you which says something about "bringing the company into disrepute". That is, if you go around saying "my boss is an idiot and our products are rubbish" they are entitled to start disciplinary proceedings against you. Many companies now have a "Social Media Policy" - that will explain what they do and don't want you doing on social media. For example, you may not be allowed to call yourself "Bob_myworkplace" or make out that you represent the company in an official capacity. They'll also say that you can't share confidential information in public. Now - there is a limit to this. If you have a totally private Facebook account and post "crap day I work, I hate my boss Fred" - then they're unlikely to find out. If you say the same thing in public, you can expect a reprimand. Similarly, if you see someone ranting about your employer - don't comment. That's not your job. The flip side is - what happens if you say "I'm gay" on Facebook. Can they fire you for that? No. But if you say "I want to hit all the kids in the daycare"... well, what do you think? I would ask your boss for a copy of the firm's social media guidelines / policy. It may also be worth asking for training so that people don't inadvertently fall foul of the rules. As ever, if you're currently facing disciplinary proceedings, it's worth talking to your Union Rep - or a specialised employment lawyer. 

For persistent chat (which I agree is good) we use $URL$ (although you can use IRC, HipChat, etc). As well as a main project channel, make sure you have some fun ones. Music Videos, funny pictures, etc. A place where people can blow off a bit of steam. Look at some team bonding exercises. Yes, it will be hard to organise across different time zones. Can you all contribute to, say, a MineCraft project? Or play some old-school Doom over the network? Video chat is great - if you have the bandwidth. Google Hangouts are really good for multiple people sharing the screen. And perhaps this should be #1 - ask them. Maybe what people want is to enjoy a beer with their team on a Friday - even if it is still midday in the US.
