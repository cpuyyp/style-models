When I made this change 15 years ago, as well as the new triple chain rings I needed to change the bottom bracket - cotterless square taper type - (which needed to be longer to correct the chain line), front derallieur (needs to be able to cope with extra travel and larger difference in chainring sizes) and rear derallieur (needs to be able to cope with larger total difference in teeth). You will also need to change your shifter to use the new range on the front. 

A couple of years ago we had a new seat tube fitted to my wifes bike (a 20 year old Claud Butler Lady Dale) after it sheared where it joined the top tube - this was on a step through frame. Fortunately we live close enough to Roberts, one of the few frame builders in the UK, to be able to deliver it. I had to strip the frame for them and it cost about £150. They completely stripped the paint off the frame so we had it powder coated - approx £100. We did this as she really likes the bike and finds it comfortable for long rides. I don't think that we could get something similar for the price. If you want to get a new seat tube, you will probably have to send it away. None of the local bike shops would consider it - they make money selling new bikes after all. I think that only Mercian and Roberts offered a quote. Hopefully this has given you an idea of the costs and what is involved. If you like your bike as it is then it can be a viable option. I suspect that the longer seat post may be the cheaper alternative. 

A person is better-trained to understand the mechanics and physics of balance, so for example coasting down a gradual hill on a pedal-bike the first time will be easier for someone who has ridden a stride-bike, but the mechanics of moving the feet in circles while pedaling and balancing will still take some time. The transition from striding to pedaling could still be tricky and require some courage, but it should be easier than of the stride bike was not used. I can't comment on whether a particular child is ready for a stride bike, but if the kid can operate it, go for it. 

These mounts are great for all bikes but on my winter bike I actually have a rigid mount that the lights snap in and out of, something like this but without the 180 swivel feature. I use hose clamps to attach the mounts to my handlebars. It's not pretty but in this regard I am all about function. I can mount, remove, and adjust the lights while wearing mittens. 

If you have managed to remove the bars then reassemble outside the bike and insert stem and wedge loosely assembled. If you have not managed to remove the stem then you need to invert the bike and get the wedge arranged and then insert the bolt through the top (that is now on the bottom). Sometimes you can use a long bolt from underneath - remove front wheel and mudguard as Mo suggests - to engage the threads and hold the wedge in place while you put the retaining bolt down as normal. 

When I was a student, I used to re-lace and true wheels using the bike upside-down as the truing stand. When touring, I carry a few spare spokes, and true by eye. It's better than riding a loaded bike on a twisted wheel. 

With that in mind, a reason that most people don't ride that far forward is because moving yourself that far forward screws with the bicycle handling and puts you too far over the front wheel. Note that bikes that enable the most aero positions, like those pictured above, achieve the effect not by moving the saddle forward, but by moving the bottom bracket back. Now, with all that lecturing done, I would say that if you are dedicated to this experiment, you can get close with the profile seatpost mentioned and an ISM saddle. The ISM is an anatomical design with two points and a gap between. A lot of riders slide forward on that saddle and hook their sitbones on the two points. This is opposed to traditional time trial saddles which just had more padding on the nose meaning that sliding forward just jams that thing into you perineum. Even better is if you can start with a bike with a steeper seat tube. 1That is a bit of hyperbole, perhaps someone rides that far forward. 

As well as the good advice given by others, sometimes the valve leaks. This should show up on the water test. I have this problem on one of my wheels but not on the other. At the moment, I can get away with pumping up once or twice a week. 

I cycle to work about 5.5 miles every day. I bring trousers, shoes and shirt to change into, all fitted into one pannier. I carefully fold the trousers and shirt in a plastic bag and lay them flat against the back of the pannier and then put the shoes in to hold them in place. Lunch box fits on top. 

On the flat and downhill, I just breathe normally. Going up steep hills, I find it helpfull to exhale in the cadence rythm, or even on each pedal stroke (twice cadence). By the time I get to this stage, the cadence has dropped so it is important to keep breathing regularly. 

Typical BMX brakes are u brakes and require 990 posts. Road bikes don't have these posts (nor do mountain bikes or hybrids). If you can't see the posts look at the position of the posts. U brake posts are above the rim. Cantilever posts (your v bakes) are below the rim. V brakes can stop you. You might need better brakes or better pads but I bet that some practice pushing the limits of your front brake will get you confidently stopping on dimes. 

Yes, they are safe. Said better, all else being equal there is nothing about the curve in an aluminum fork that would make it less safe than a straight fork. 

I also use friction shifters, and recently put a 10 speed cassette onto my freehub - previously I had a seven. I put a 10 speed chain on as the chain walls are narrower. I have not yet changed the front chainrings, which are "eight speed". In your case put on a chain to match your cassette. Seven speed cassettes usually have a spacer on the wheel side when used on a larger freehub. It's always advisable to change the chain when you change the cassette anyway. 

I used Swalbe Marathon's last year without too many problems. As has been previously said, the narrow (25mm) tyres do help cut through snow, but when you are on ice nothing is very good. I liked Continental Top Tourers previously. 

Of course you can get the super-bright LEDs that have cords and battery packs; I have tried them and do not need them. Flashlights work great, I can carry spare lights and batteries easily and it's all swappable. I have a charger at work and at home and the batteries are cheap and abundant. I also ride with a small blinkie headlight that I velcro to the top of my helmet; easy on and off and charges via USB. As I said, independent lights let me ride any bike any time and I can leave my bike anywhere. I can post links to any and all hardware but this isn't an advertisement. EDIT: I use the taillight from Dinotte. The Quad RED is the current offering but I am still using the 300R that I bought in October 2010 which is still going strong.
