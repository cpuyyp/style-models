You are obviously needed on that project and should not try to get away from it. Many of the answers and comments recommend making a paper trail, or at least an email trail. This is good. They are right, but for the wrong reason. Everybody talks about doing it for ass-coverage. This is the wrong angle. You should be doing it to help the project and the company. Make recommendations as best you can, make Manager X write down that they are not going to follow your recommendations. If necessary, print out a document and make him sign it. Make a scene if necessary. Yes, this is making you look like an bastard, but that is what Manager X needs at this point. The point is this: You are making it very clear to Manager X that he is acting against your recommendations, and that you are documenting this fact. This will, or should, make him worry about his own ass. @AlexeyVesnin suggested that Manager X was involved in shady deals with the contractor. If so, he should be starting to get cold feet at this point. Make him think that you are going to find out about this deal and expose it. Hopefully he will go to the contractors and cancel the deal (and possibly the contract) The best result would be if Manager X actually pulled himself together and started doing a proper job. Publicly he would get credit, but the important people would know who to thank. 

I think it is a perfectly reasonable question to ask, and answering this could reveal many important aspect of candidate's personality. To me it looks good, at least on paper. But how the other person perceives the questions depends upon many other factors as well, like the tone of voice, body language and other subtle messages communicated sub consciously. You can always introspect and ask for more details on feedback as what exactly made it look like aggressive, and what can be improved and taken care of. 

It would be appropriate to just write about the skill you are good at. This would implicitly let your recruiter know about your skill set. Keep it focused. Also if when I say I am not good at certain things, doesn't it implies, I am good at rest? This will make resume confusing and awkward. If you are already pursuing some course to improve on some skills, you can mention about the courses, to let them know what you are heading towards. During interview if asked, or in a situation, you can discuss your level and comfort with skills. 

Career decisions should always be taken keeping long term perspective in mind. And salary is just one criteria for selecting a job. There are other factors like, company, work culture, learning, growth, work life balance and more. Give a weightage to all the factors, and then evaluate how much difference the monetary factor is going to make. Other things being equal, in my opinion you can easily make out for those extra pounds (quiet possibly more) if the job offer adds rich learning and that experience to your profile. In most of the cases, its proven that long term investments reap more. While negotiating, one should not sound like money is the only important factor that count and you can move elsewhere if the offer does not meet your expectation. Instead you should try to convince the employer by highlighting your knowledge and skills and the value addition that you make to the organization. This would give an impression that you are interested for the opportunity and chances would be better then. Sometimes the companies have a capping for a certain level of experience and role, in such case it would be difficult to cross the boundary. 

If you would create such list it would be much easier to predict the amount of work - you won't have to think about the whole project but of each separate element/point It would also remind you of the possible issues you could come across As a bonus the client would know exactly what he's getting and for some problematic clients the list would prevent them from demanding extra work that supposedly had to be done in the same project and if some extra issues arise, that weren't mentioned earlier then the client should be billed for them but you should always tell the client in advance that if for example you have to upload the files for the client, instead of just zipping and emailing the files to him, then he must provide the correct account credentials and if there would be a problem with the account then he will decide whether he wants to pay you for handling the issue or he wants to call his hosting company and get their support to handle it... 

The problem will partially solve itself once you gather more experience handling such issues as it will take you less time to handle and you will take such issues into account when you predict the amount of time it will take you. A nice tip is to double (or even triple) the hours you initially predict as there will always be some surprises When the client approaches you with a project you should create some sort of technical specs for the project or at least a list, specifying all the elements you will handle for the client. Afterwards you should make it as detailed as possible (don't worry - it will go faster once you get the hang of it) and once each element is detailed enough it should be easier to predict the time for each element. You don't have to show the complete detailed list to the client but I find that showing at least bullet points allows the client to remember extra issues he forgot to mention, both of you will know what you've signed up to do and as a bonus you will be able to explain why it would take the time you're asking to pay for. As a simple example - if the client orders a login form then the list could be: 

It is a good thing to let the recruiter know that you are not looking for job change, politely and with gratitude. I would reply with something like this in such situations - 

While applying for a job, you should only send the documents that are required for the job. You should not attach any other documents (.PDF file of the instructional material) in the email. If it is something which is related to the job you are applying for and you think you should showcase it then, you just need to mention in your resume (which you already did). During personal interview, you can discuss more about this. 

Going with rational evaluation normally doesn't work well for decisions like choosing career stream. Career decisions are very subjective to a person's interests and aptitude. Make a career which you enjoy and cherish doing and which matches with you aptitude. Taking decisions on other factors might look good for short duration, but in longer run, being happy with a job supersedes over all other parameters. So I would suggest you to evaluate both the career options from those perspectives and decide accordingly. Good luck!
