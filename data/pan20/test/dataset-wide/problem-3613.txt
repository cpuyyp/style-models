I agree wholeheartedly that used weights are fine. If it's heavy, it achieves its purpose! I don't think brand matters. Olympic plates typically go for about $0.50/lb on craigslist. You should be able to get decent-looking plates at this price (not too rusty), but if you find some rusty ones, it's easy to clean off the rust and spray paint (get them at a lower price in this case). A used 7' (45 lb) olympic bar should probably sell for $40-50. Giving a going rate for benches is harder - there's just too much difference in build, features, etc. The (used) bench I bought cost me $25, which I think was a good price. It's sturdy, but it's flawed in that the supports are too close together, so the bar isn't balanced when it has a 45' plate on just one side (during loading) so I have to slide the bar for leverage, which is annoying. No frills like decline. *Note: this is a very U.S.-centric response. If you're from elsewhere, this may not apply. 

As far as when to stop doing the program (and really cut), I think the main consideration is not to blow your chance to take full advantage of the potential novice strength gains: 

First, you'll want to pick a set of exercises to do and learn how to do them with proper form. Then you can start increasing the weight and set a schedule. In general, I would recommend a full-body workout that hits all the muscle groups with a few compound lifts. However, I'll try to craft a workout for you here that fits your stated goal with the equipment that you have. For exercises, try: 

I'll assert that drinking water will render the net contents of the stomach more fluid, moving the gastric emptying rate from the blue curve towards the red curve. This seems to confirm the conclusion that avoiding liquid during the meal will help stave off the next bout of hunger because a more solid meal will take longer to empty. The 15 minutes before also seems to fit, as roughly half of liquid consumed 15 minutes beforehand will have been emptied before the meal starts. If one further considers the dynamics, drinking water immediately before a meal will help fill up the stomach and reduce immediate hunger but will cause that meal to be digested faster, so I hypothesize that you will be hungrier sooner with this approach. 

LightBulb, While there are many excellent ideas to think about in the responses on this thread, already, I would like to register my opinion that there is no "one-size-fits-all" regimen, or type of work-out, that's "best" for people of all ages, all physical conditions, all body-types (by "body-type" I mean such genetic factors as metabolism, and your tendency to have a "natural" gene determined optimal weight). Also, your long-term, and recent, exercise history comes into play here: it's one thing to be re-starting to exercise after a long period of not exercising; quite another to be very obese and just starting to exercise; another "universe" entirely to be over sixty, and start weight-lifting. Without knowing the details of your age, your current physical condition, your history of exercise, and more information about your diet, metabolism, sleep habits, use or non-use of stimulants, tobacco, alcohol, etc., I don't think a lot can be said, except to congratulate you for starting to exercise ! But, one generalization I think can be made is that working out ... doing the same work-out ... more than four or five times per week is probably too much. And, particularly if you are "pushing your limits" you need to consider, and find, your body's minimal rest period for restoration. On the other hand, if you are varying types of exercise, for example: doing cardio three times per week; doing weights twice a week; and swimming twice a week, imho, I think that can be a good thing. The key thing is to avoid resuming exercise to fast, and too intensely, after a period of relatively not exercising. To do that is to risk injury, and the kind of exhaustion that will lead you to stop exercising, particularly: imho, if you are over fifty years of age. A key variable you can work with, as referred to in several responses here, is "intensity:" as you probably already know, achieving a certain level of intensity, and maintaining it for a certain amount of time, is essential to increasing "aerobic fitness." Similarly, the relatively newer concept of high-intensity interval-training (HIIT) in anaerobic exercise, suggests that short intense heavyweight work-outs, interspersed with exercise using lighter weights, can give you quicker gains in strength, and stamina (I have not seen studies of anaerobic HIIT and weight loss, or gain). Finally, there's every indication that using "variety" in your work-outs, varying their type, and what you do, has a strong effect on total impact and carry-over of strength and fitness into everyday life. For me (age 69), a combination of alternate days of aerobic exercise, and weights, with two days off, and then a swim-day, works best, but I vary that by sometimes doing a work-out where I alternate fifteen minutes on a treadmill with a circuit of several weight-machine exercises where I do high reps per set, and repeat that cycle three times. The more you exercise and observe carefully how your body responds; the more you pay attention to your diet, and adapt to a more healthy way of eating, the easier it gets. My own personal bias is that a longer-term effort involving exercise and slow change of diet is much better than any "dieting," per se. And, for some people, like myself, born with a very slow metabolism, and a large frame, we need to accept that being large (not obese, but heavy, and having more body-fat than other people) is just a natural part of who we are. good luck, Bill 

Ive read that most climbers have a lot of muscle imbalances, including some that affect proper posture. 

As for the joint health part - why exactly are you trying to improve it? If youre experiencing joint pain or other similar problems, self medication and simple self-perscribed diet fixes are not the way to go. You should simply go see a doctor. If youre just wanting to have a healthier diet, you may try to include some gelatin. It is said that gelatin may positively affect your joints - there were some studies that i cant find right now, but they were inconclusive. The gelatin eating group improved their joint health compared to the placebo control group, but the positive effects may have came from increased vitamin c intake for the gelatin group. As for the rest of your diet, since you say its mostly grains + olive oil, im not quite sure youre getting all the necessary aminoacids in your food (the ones that cant be produced by the human body), also i suspect that you might not eat enough protein in general. Could you estimate your daily protein intake in grams? Considering your height, weight and the fact that you say youre doing resistance training for quite some time now, I'd say you should weigh a little more. Are you "skinny"? If so, it might be because youre not eating enough protein. 

The first and best way to check if youre doing something wrong is to check your progress. If you find yourself on a plateau, then probably someting is wrong. What are your weekly/monthly weight increments? Have you failed to meet them? If not, youre probably doing fine. As for the soreness, a bit of stretching after the workout wouldnt hurt. Also some mild activity in the regeneration phase. Try walking to work instead of using the car, or simply have a walk when the soreness kicks in. It will improve the bloodflow and help the muscle regenarate. Dont push it too hard tho - remember that you are resting. Also make sure youre eating enough protein. Bad diet could also be a cause of slower/no progress. You might want to try changing your traning program to whole body workouts 3 times a week. You probably will see quicker results by doing so, and the legs would get their workout more often - they could accomodate to the stress, and your DOMS shouldnt be so bad. As far as I know, the one-bodypart-a-day training programs are quite specific and targeted at advanced bodybuilders. It seems to me you are just trying to get/keep fit, and for that purpose, a whole body training program might do a better job. On a side note, I think you should focus on free weights wherever possible. I see you are doing a lot of machine exercises. Machines look all fancy and cool, and make it very hard to hurt yourself while using them, but make it very easy to hurt yourself when doing some actual real life lifting. The machines are designed to force a particular movement. Your big muscles are doing the work and they get stronger, but the little stabilizing muscles have nothing to do, since the machine keeps the weight steady and makes it move the correct way. The stabilizing muscles are weak, and when you try to lift something heavy, they cannot hold everything in place as they are sopposed to and bam!, you end up with an injury. Try to get a specialist to teach you proper form and try doing freeweight exercises. They are better for you :)
