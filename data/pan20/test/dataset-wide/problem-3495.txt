Let me offer a "class-based" answer. Living in Manhattan, I see directly a phenomenon too little reported. There is inflation, enormous rapid inflation within the upper classes. Prices of luxury goods, multi-million dollar apartments, connoisseur items, first-class travel, artworks, ivy educations, rare wines, hedge-fund fees, high-tech medicine, philanthropic gestures, etc. The annual percentage increases are staggering. It is truly as if the money being pumped into the "shareholder" classes is being burned up at a desperate rate. Yet what is traditionally measured as "inflation" is sticky wage inflation. Only when wages begin to rise does the Fed slow the presses. High employment signaled by rising wages sounds the "inflation alarm" and a threat to the interests of the "shareholder" class. Credit flinches. So I would suggest that in many institutional, political, and social ways, there has emerged a class-based solution to the 1970s problem of "inflation." As long as wages are disaggregated the old type of "inflation" does not apply. You can print as much money as you want, as long as it goes directly to a concentrated, limited cartel. This, coupled with destabilization of the Middle East and military control of oil supplies, returned the U.S.from the 1970s "brink" to the sort of stable, wage-depressed, class-dominated economy favored by Andrew Mellon, Prescott Bush, and their ilk. As long as labor is disaggregated, it cannot democratize and "deteriorate" the value of increasing money supplies. 

Such preferences have a utility representation $u(x, y) = xy$, and therefore they are reflexive, transitive and complete. However, these are not symmetric because $(1,2)\succsim (1,1)$ but $(1,1)\not\succsim (1,2)$. But we can define the indifference relation $\sim$ from the weak preference relation $\succsim$ in this way: 

$u$ does not represent the same preference as $v(x, y) =\min(x, y)$. Here is the indifference map of $v$ : 

Let $w$ denote the existing wealth of agent A. Agent has an option to attain higher education by paying $F$ as fees and in return can earn $y_1$ with probability $p$ and $y_2$ with probability $1-p$, where $y_1>y_2$. So, the choice is between saying yes or no to higher education. If he says yes to higher education, his wealth will be $w - F + y_1$ with probability $p$ and $w - F + y_2$ with probability $1-p$. If he says no, then his wealth remains at $w$. He will say yes if his expected utility from higher education is more i.e. $p(w - F + y_1)^a + (1-p)(w - F + y_2)^{a} > w^a$ 

Since payoff from playing $D$ is more than the payoff from playing any other strategy for player 2, he will always choose $D$ in response to any mixed strategy of player 1 where 1 play $B$ with probability $p$ and $C$ with probability $(1-p)$. Therefore, $D$ is the best response of player 2 if 1 play a mixed strategy $B$ with probability $p$ and $C$ with probability $(1-p)$. However, given the strategy $D$ of player 2, player 1's best response is to play a pure strategy $B$. Therefore, there is no Nash equilibrium in which player 1 mixes between $B$ & $C$. 

Like many noneconomists who read about economic history and finance, I always remain somewhat baffled by the opaque generation of currency under the federal reserve system. My understanding is that the banks "loan" money to the government, which prints a federal reserve note or IOU signed by Treasury. But then what? How do the banks actually receive federal currency and/or credit... and determine the amounts they receive? My understanding is that banks can effectively receive as much money as they can "justify" by credit contracts, ratings, and a given ratio of leverage or fractional reserve. Apart from market forces and assumed prudence, are these the only factors that legally limit the amounts of money banks can receive? Can banks essentially get as much money as they say they can securely loan? 

I wish to dissent from some of the suggestions in the answers above. First, inflation need not be uniform, and it has a political component. So the idea that rising hamburger prices will be offset by rising wages is by no means certain. At present, we see in many areas of the nation rising costs in housing, education, and other "essentials" that are not offset by rising wages. In some markets, like Manhattan where I live, growing income inequality can mean "inflation" inequality. Stagnant wages meet rising upper-tier incomes and rising property prices. So in certain possible worlds your hamburger might become unaffordable to wage-earners. When you ask if inflated money can become technically "worthless," the answer is yes. In the Weimar hyperinflation, there were cases of money being burned for fuel because its value as "money" was less than its value as "paper." Since paper is about as intrinsically valueless as a monetary medium can get, one might say the state certification of "money" had become "worth less" than any practical medium and thus "worthless." 

For Q 4 : Utility maximization problem of the consumer is : \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x_1, x_2} & \ \ \frac{x_2}{(1+x_1)^2} \\ \text{s.t.} & \ \ x_1+x_2 \leq 5 \\ \text{and} & \ \ 0 \leq x_2 \leq x_1 \end{eqnarray*} Here is the constraint set of the consumer, along with a few indifference curves: 

First verify that $\overline{g}_1 = \theta$ and $\overline{g}_2 = \beta$. We'll now find Subgame perfect equilibrium for all possible values of $(\theta, \beta)$ satisfying $\theta > \beta> 1$. To do so, we first maximize player 2's payoff with respect to his contribution taking as given player 1's contribution: \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{g_2 \geq 0} & \ \beta\ln (g_1+g_2)- g_2 \end{eqnarray*} and we get the best response strategy of player 2 as a function of player 1's contribution: \begin{eqnarray*} g_2 = \max(\beta - g_1, 0) \end{eqnarray*} Next, solve player 1's payoff maximization problem taking as given player 2's strategy \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{g_1 \geq 0} & \ \theta\ln (g_1+g_2)- g_1 \\ \text{s.t.} & \ g_2 = \max(\beta - g_1, 0)\end{eqnarray*} and we get \begin{eqnarray*} g_1^* = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } \theta < e\beta \\ \theta & \text{if } \theta \geq e\beta\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} Consequently, the contribution of player 2 in a subgame perfect outcome is \begin{eqnarray*} g_2^* = \begin{cases} \beta & \text{if } \theta < e\beta \\ 0 & \text{if } \theta \geq e\beta\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} For the next one, the cost of player 2 is \begin{eqnarray*} c_2(g_2) = \begin{cases} g_2 & \text{if } g_1 \geq \overline{g}_1 = \theta \\ \lambda g_2 & \text{if } g_1 < \overline{g}_1 = \theta\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} First verify that in this case $\overline{g}_1 = \theta$ and $\overline{g}_2 = \dfrac{\beta}{\lambda}$. We'll now find Subgame perfect equilibrium for all possible values of $(\theta, \beta, \lambda)$ satisfying $1 <\theta \leq \dfrac{\beta}{\lambda} < \beta$. To do so, we first maximize player 2's payoff with respect to his contribution taking as given player 1's contribution: \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{g_2 \geq 0} & \ \beta\ln (g_1+g_2)- c_2(g_2) \end{eqnarray*} and we get the best response strategy of player 2 as a function of player 1's contribution: \begin{eqnarray*} g_2 = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\beta}{\lambda} - g_1 & \text{if } g_1 < \overline{g}_1 = \theta \\ \max\left({\beta} - g_1, 0\right) & \text{if } g_1 \geq \overline{g}_1 = \theta \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} Next, solve player 1's payoff maximization problem taking as given player 2's strategy \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{g_1 \geq 0} & \ \theta\ln (g_1+g_2)- g_1 \\ \text{s.t.} & \ g_2 = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\beta}{\lambda} - g_1 & \text{if } g_1 < \overline{g}_1 = \theta \\ \max\left({\beta} - g_1, 0\right) & \text{if } g_1 \geq \overline{g}_1 = \theta \end{cases}\end{eqnarray*} and we get \begin{eqnarray*} g_1^* = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } \lambda < e \\ \theta & \text{if } \lambda \geq e\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} Consequently, the contribution of player 2 in a subgame perfect outcome is \begin{eqnarray*} g_2^* = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\beta}{\lambda} & \text{if } \lambda < e \\ \beta - \theta & \text{if } \lambda \geq e\end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} 

John Stuart Mill famously remarked that labor-saving machines have not saved one minute of labor. More seriously, Marx argued, roughly, that machines can gain temporary market advantage, but cannot produced "surplus value," which come only from increasing attachment of labor. (Though Marx's value theory is complex and slightly ambiguous.) Nonetheless, observers, neoliberal and socialist alike, seem to agree that machines are "productive" and "labor-saving" overall. For neoliberals this is productive "innovation" and for leftists "technological unemployment." The idea of a future where "most work is done by robots" seems remarkably widespread. This strikes me as a fallacy for three reasons. First, in a rough adaptation of Say's Law, someone must obviously make, fuel, and maintain the machines. Someone else must, for example, mine the additional metals, feed the miners who mine the metals, raise the farmers who feed the miners who....etc. Second, the rise of "labor-saving technology" since the 19th century has come with a huge, five-fold increase in the global laboring population. The "local" increases in per-laborer productivity appear more than offset by the attachment and utilization of increased, lower-cost labor worldwide. Third, the idea of "robots doing all the work" would seem to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Machines cannot run or reproduce themselves. The only "perpetual motion machine" is life itself. Without humans all machines succumb to entropy almost immediately. This would apply to any level of technology. I am not arguing that machines make no difference. But is this difference primarily local and conditional? Is the local "productivity" of machines primarily and irreducibly a way of displacing labor globally... and redirecting labor through "machines" from lower-cost to higher-cost zones? Above all, is it logically possible for machines to produce more "work" in total than goes into them? Again, even apart from issues about "quality of work," I am always surprised at how many people seem to assume this "robot replacement scenario" is plausible. P.S. Though I would like to respond to answers and comments, the "comment" function is not working for me at the moment, I have asked "Help" about it. My argument from thermodynamics appears to be misunderstood, I will address as soon as possible.
