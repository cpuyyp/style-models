That's the Moon alright, and it's definitely real and definitely there. If you go outside and look at the Sun right now, the Moon will be almost but not quite on top of it, though it's impossible to make out due to the Sun's glare. If it were any closer we would have had a solar eclipse around the time of the New Moon that took place 20 minutes ago. Two weeks from now at Full Moon, it'll be in even better alignment, though on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun this time, which will result in a total lunar eclipse. Mark your calendar! 

Are black holes expected to contain the same ratio of dark matter to regular matter as the rest of the universe? I've heard that dark matter is distributed in halos around galaxies. Does that make it less likely to be ingested into a black hole? 

In watching this Hubble video on Omega Centari it got me thinking about how dense a galaxy can get. Do we know how dense a galaxy can get? Are there any good resources on reading more about very dense galaxies? 

Caltech just released a report that says there is possibly a large (10 earth mass) planet in a remote orbit (10 - 20 thousand year) that explains a lot of observations of Kuiper Belt objects. How long could it take for this to be confirmed or refuted observationally? See this video 

Earlier today I was exploring the astronomy features on WolframAlpha, when I stumbled upon an intriguing numerical relationship involving the values for the lunar synodic and sidereal months. Using the values $$P_{syn}=1\,\text{synodic month}=29.530588\,\text{days},~~P_{sid}=1\,\text{sidereal month}=27.321661\,\text{days},$$ I noticed that this algebraic combination is very close to one year: $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}^{-1}-P_{syn}^{-1}}=365.256396\,\text{days}\\ \frac{1}{P_{sid}^{-1}-P_{syn}^{-1}}-1\,\text{tropical year}=0.0142053\,\text{days}\approx20\,\text{minutes}.$$ I really doubt this this is a coincidence. Is there a simple way to understand what makes this approximate equality hold? 

Hydrogen clouds don't even make up a small component of dark matter, because hydrogen is not dark. The image below depicts the emission spectrum of hydrogen in the visible regime (a.k.a., the Balmer series). 

LIGO detectors have two 4 km arms, and everything in those arms in suspended in a vacuum. The actual dimensions of those arms I was unable to find, but the published paper here has more information for you to peruse. 

I was reading the paper about LIGO's detection of gravitational waves, and I wanted to know what the Schwarzschild Radius did. For example, I feel like the simulation here is oversimplified, and that reality wouldn't actually have that simple bump together of the two radii. 

This is plausible, and might even be a good idea if used right. First off, NASA has been working on plans for an asteroid redirect mission, called ARM. While it remains to be seen whether this will be approved, and they plan to put it into lunar orbit, this is a hypothetical scenario anyways so I'll ignore that. Now, putting an asteroid into earth orbit is a little bit of a difficult subject. Sure, you could do it, but messing up would net you a whole lot of problems. I presume it would have to go into high earth orbit if it goes into orbit at all. This rules out using the asteroid directly like a satellite, but that would have been impractical even if it was sanctioned by everyone with enough influence to have an opinion on earth. From there the satellite would be best used as a base of operations, from which you could send drones to collect junk and keep refueling stations. I'd also include a telescope or two, but that's personal preference. If you want a list of targets though, here would be a good place to look. 

There's a lot of interest with the recent discovery of seven earth sized planets around TRAPPIST-1. I saw this poster, and the NASA video says that in the system you could see a lot of other planets whipping around in their orbits. It got me wondering: 

When we see the Milky Way on a dark night are we seeing the bulk of the galaxy, or just our local arm? How much of the milky way is visible to the naked eye on a dark night? 

The black hole GRS 1915+105 was observed to be spinning at near the theoretical maximum spin rate. Assuming you had two such black holes spinning clockwise, and also orbiting each other clockwise, what would happen if they merged? How could the new black hole avoid breaking the rotational speed limit? Where would the extra angular momentum go? 

Thales of Miletus purportedly predicted a solar eclipse (most likely the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BCE). The historicity of Thales' prediction can't be verified with any certainty given the sparsity of written records documenting the pre-Socratic era that have survived to present day. So, putting the historical question of whether or not he did aside, what plausible answers are there to the question of how he could/would have made such a prediction? 

The emission spectrum of dark matter on the other hand would be completely black. Dark matter is gets its name from the fact that it doesn't absorb or emit light, i.e., electromagnetic radiation. From an elementary particle standpoint, this means dark matter particles can't interact with photons via the electromagnetic force at all, so dark matter particles must be electrically neutral, which electrons and protons certainly are not. No electrons are protons means no hydrogen atoms. 

Could you use gravitational waves to communicate from inside the event horizon of a black hole to someone who was outside? 

How big are the chunks of rock ice that make up Saturn's rings? Are there many objects larger than pebble size? 

How long would the orbital period be for an object the mass of the moon orbiting the sun at 1 light year in a circular orbit? 

According to Caltech there is possibly a planet 10 times the mass of earth in a 15-20 thousand year orbit at an odd angle. It hasn't been observed yet. There's a search for it ongoing. 

This would seem to be constrained to planets and moons earth has landed on or impacted at all, as we have no way of telling after the fact whether a lander was perfectly sterilized. That list is as follows: Planets: 

I know some measures must exist, but I have no idea what the programs are, what organizations are involved, or how effective they are. 

I understand basically that the universe is homogenous (looks the same from every point) and I was told in my astro class that it's supposed to have no center, but how that works boggles my mind. I can't get over the feeling that from some point in the universe a civilization could look in a certain direction and see a sign indicative of the direction towards the edge or the center, like younger galaxies or a lack of galaxies moving a certain direction. EDIT: Thanks to Sir Cumference for highlighting some things that are unclear about my question. Sure, to a certain extent you might be able to think of the universe as being without a center, but if you think of a ball growing larger from nothing, and you pick a random point in the growing sphere, you can always say that the point is further from some points on the sphere than others, or in other words, that there is a direction towards a "center". Any other details you can give that are related at all would be extremely welcome. 

Theoretical Planet Nine, proposed by Caltech's Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, is said to have a 15-20 thousand year orbit. Approximately how bright would the sun appear from Planet Nine aphelion and perihelion? 

When black holes are merging, and emitting gravitational waves, are we seeing those waves start when the event horizons are merging, or when the singularities are merging? 

After reading about Barnard's Star and how it's approaching us 140 km/sec, I'm curious if there are any visualizations of how the nearest stars to Sol will be moving over the next 100k years or so. I'm amazed that Barnard's Star, currently 6 light years away, will be only 3.8 light years away in about 9,800 years. It's really moving!
