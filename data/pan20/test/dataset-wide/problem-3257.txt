So my argument here is that division of labor must have started very early at the clan or small village level, tens of thousands of years ago, and that with time only its complexity grew. So moving on from these basic division we come to trade. Consider that in the age of agriculture two kinds of commodities would be in demand: 1. Food 2. Materials These two things would then depend on geography. One place would have copper, another iron, another good clay for pottery, another would be good for wheat, and yet another would have fruits. So at this point trade had started. It has been shown that trade in fact is very old and that often items from one culture have been dug out in archeological sites thousands of miles away. So trade would then lead to the next level of specialization, that of whole town, cities or regions in specific items. So trade would be the next prerequisite. A small point here: trade does not necessarily imply that one person would travel thousands of miles; it could instead consist of dozens of smaller journeys from one merchant to another, with goods taking many years to get from one place to another. Yet trade would then impose another requirement, that of security, as in the ability to actually make it from one place to another profitably, and this would then explain one of the motivations for empire building: namely the pursuit of wealth. 

Almost immediately we have division of labor between men and women, since only women can give birth and only women can breast feed. There would be a division of labor between the young and old, with the younger people going out hunting and the older people becoming village elders Shamans and priests are almost as old as human civilization itself as attested by cave paintings which definitely show a religious character Tool making is almost as old as humanity itself and it would stand to reason that some would be better than others at making tools (manual dexterity, intelligence etc.) and so would be the chief tool makers Pottery also seems to be a very old art, with fragments found in many old archeological sites, and again it would stand to reason that some would be better than others. 

Backgammon is a very old Iranian game and is commonly played throughout Iran. Norooz, or the celebration of the new year is pre Islamic and is celebrated throughout Iran by all Iranians. It carries with it the haft-seen, a ceremonial spread to celebrate the new year. Iranian months have old Iranian names that hearken back to old Iranian religions. The ruins at Persepolis and to a lesser extent at Pasargadae, Susa, and Tisphon (among thousands of others) and various mountain tombs and especially Cyrus's tomb are highly regarded and very influential in the Iranian Psyche. Iranians still regard Cyrus the Great (~550BC) as the founder of the country and probably its most influential ruler. He and the Achaemenid dynasty have had a profound effect on defining Persian identity. Many Iranians choose names from this dynasty. Sassanian universities, especially the one at Ghondishapur, formed the backbone of Iranian education and later were hugely influential on Islamic and European universities. The shahnameh, though written after Islam, is an epic poem purely devoted to pre Islamic Iranian mythology and kingship and has had large influence on the Farsi language and revival of Iranian literature which was largely banned and destroyed at the start of Islam in Iran. Zoroastrian moral ideology (Goftare Neek, Pendare Neek, Kerdare Neek) has affected Iranian character deeply. 

There is yet another reason why the male nude was common in Greece. The Greeks were obsessed with perfect proportions in all of their art, for they saw these proportions as a sign of the divine cosmos. Perhaps the most notable of these monuments is the Parthenon and its Golden Mean ratios, a temple dedicated to Athena which, very clearly links perfect proportions to the divine. This ideology permeated everything in Greek culture and philosophy. Think, for example, of Pythagoras and his discovery of musical intervals and their perfect proportions, or the so called Platonic solids. The human body inherently is a study in the Golden Mean. All of the limbs of the body adhere to some form of Golden Mean ratio and the Greeks knew this. Greek statues were there to celebrate the divine by exploring the perfection of the human body. Note that almost no Greek Statue (and being careful here, since many Greek statues we know are actually Roman copies of Greek originals) shows a body that is not perfect. Also note that any garment that covers the body will be human made and thus not part of the divine. To see divine creation you must draw the nude. Now combine this with the subject matter of Greek statues which, are typically mythical heroes or heroines and gods and goddesses. Such perfect statues were the only way that the perfection of heroes, heroines, gods, and goddesses could be worshipped. By the word worship here I mean a celebration that includes being awed and inspired. So basically the nude literally shows "naked perfection," and no other creation was seen as more perfect as the body of the idealized male. 

Farming lost it's prestige in prehistory with the growth of organized warfare. Organized farming began many thousand years before Christ in the fertile soils at the estuaries of mountain run offs and in the flood plain of rivers. Most such communities were initially organized into small scale villages with communal farming and later developed into city states. Now here I am talking thousands of years before the Egyptian Pharaohs. Organized farming led to a population boom at the time and as a result cities grew massively, spawning off sister villages which in turn became cities. Excavated statues and figurines show that up to this time such people worshiped the goddess and were probably organized on a matriarchal basis, with women or communities having title to the land, with women actively engaged in farming and advancing the science of farming. But with population growth came conflict and warfare which eventual led to the creation of minor kingdoms, with rulers controlling several cities and communities, together with their farms. At this point the ruling class consisted of warriors and priests who would own the land but never work it. The work that was considered important was the work of the warrior and the intellectual work of the priests. Together with this upheaval feminine deities were replaced by male deities and matriarchal societies replaced by patriarchal societies, with almost all positions of power were increasingly dominated by men. This then, the fall of matriarchy and women's status coincided with the fall of the value of farming. This tradition then intensified and grew until the first empires were formed, and it was fully incorporated into all the major succeeding empires, including the Qin, Sassanian, and Roman empires. By this point, all manual labor, with farming its chief employer was considered beneath the ruling aristocracy. Consider also that much farming was carried out by slaves and serfs who were tied to the land and were considered property. The sons of aristocracy would then either become land-owning warriors or priests. Later, when Europe began its universities around 1100 AD, most universities would only study arts, medicine, law, and theology, with arts being the lowest in rank, and even then mainly consisting of literature and philosophy. So enshrined in the university system was the thinking that any kind of manual labor was unworthy of a scholar. I believe this kind of thinking still persists to modern times, though much eroded, so for example, law is considered higher than engineering. So despite the fact that agriculture continued to be the main source of wealth for almost all ruling classes well past the Renaissance, agricultural workers were looked down on, with many aristocrats holding to the view that manual laborers were lower humans, less capable of thought and emotion, and generally of lower inherent value.
