It would depend on the legs, or not. If an otherwise normally flighted bird has a tiny pair of Tyranosaurus arms, it isn't going to make much difference one way or the other. If they have a full on second set of drumsticks, they are going to be heavier and not fly as well as if they weren't carrying the extra weight. Finally... look at existing birds with two legs... some of them take off gracefully and strongly with their legs kicking off under them... others don't use their legs at all... others have to get a running start... still others bounce like beach balls when they attempt to land. Nature being what it is... 2 more legs can be anything you want it to be if your narrative is thoughtful enough. 

The Math Assuming biologically humans can have one baby a year safely from 16 to 40, and that your 100 couples start at 16 years old on day 1 with 100% success rate... with no multiple births and perfect gender parity.... then my math (which is dubious) says about 115 years. There are SO many factors though... assuming every woman is fertile for that whole period, healthy enough to bear children for 24 years... which is... ludicrous in real life, but theorhetically possible... Honestly the men are bordering on irrelevant in this equation. Worse... detrimental... if you replaced 70 of your men with more women, you could get there sooner. The Logistics Ok I reread the original question to clarify something about HOUSING... where are all these rapidly spawned folks going to live. I realized these are real world colonists that are said to be self sufficient hunter-gatherers. My calculation (and everyone elses so far) assumes these are people in a vacuum with their needs being met, etc. Requiring them to farm and ranch to sustain themselves, and their vast families, build homes and communities. Govern. etc... The children and men can only do so much. I think it is unlikely in this scenario that humans can breed at this rate successfully. This would DRASTICALLY diminish the birth rate. 

The sky does not depend on the ground! If you change your perspective there is another potential solution. How do you manage a city that is miles WIDE... you don't put all your resources one one end and pipe them all from that location to every building on the grid, you distribute them THROUGHOUT your city. A city that is miles high can extend that paradigm to the third dimension... 

@plutotheplanet touched on it but I think hydrogen sac drifting is potentially viable... bio-electric electrolysis paired with an inflatable membrane. Fish, fowl, and amphibians all exhibit air bladders already, so that half of the equation is proven... bio-electricity is represented already on terran life forms... I think the evolutionary path of something that could combine them is visible. 

Desert != Unlivable... it just means it doesn't get rain. Groundwater, runoff from the mountains, etc. can provide abundant water. 

Historically this has already occurred in multiple recorded instances... our circadian rhythm is malleable. Removing any time devices from a person, no clocks, no day/night cycle, and their clocks will change. Longer I believe, something like 30 hours... there have been studies, I'll see about finding citations. In the pre-industrial era, middle ages possibly, in northern regions we operated with two waking cycles per day... one during daylight, one at night. Optometry is telling us all now to stay off electronics at night because the blue light disrupts or circadian rhythm and prevents us from falling naturally to sleep... I've spent years on swing shifts where I got to a point where predawn light triggers a sleep response (though I avoided actual dawn light desperately because the wakefullness brought on by a flood of natural light is really hard to overcome) ...also consider the Arctic, at certain times of the year "day" and "night" are fundamentally arbitrary. I was up there in the summer one year and was surprised how comfortable doing whatever, whenever became. This is a very strongly supported logic in both biology and sociology... being diurnal is an easy fit for civilized man, so we think of it as "natural"... but I wouldn't say it is intrinsic to the human condition by any stretch. 

Yes. Can you accidentally shoot yourself in the foot with a pistol? There isn't really a difference except for scale. You are already accepting a guidance/engine failure as a real world scenario, you are only needing the arming sequence also fail simultaneously. It is a system, systems fail. It may be extremely unlikely that all the moving parts fail simultaneously, but the "is it possible" question is most assuredly yes. The "how" is as easy to find as opening a browser and searching for weird stories about how things break... 

Below the Surface If they focused expanding downward into the ocean, their expansion would be uncontested and their technology would be if not ignored, but only viewed with curiosity. USO could be a step ahead of the rest of the world when catastrophe strikes. When the oceans rise, the USO has a tremendous advantage over everyone else, and as a bonus they can retreat from the surface and become untouchable by the countries that are surface bound. This could go either the humanitarian way, where the USO helps the rest of the world cope, and become world leaders... or they can use their undersea superiority to raid and destroy the now flooded regions of other nations and prevent them from getting a foothold in the sea. 

I think "yes" but with a couple changes in perspective: Firstly think dirigible and not hot air balloon: Don't use your gas to control your altitude, it is too valuable to just vent it. Use impellers and control planes, like a blimp to FLY up and down. The "throw in more fuel to go up" portion is unlikely... but that doesn't mean they can't generate all the lift necessary OVER TIME... Which also solves the mass problem... keeping a colony of bacteria on hand that is just large enough to perpetually keep the dirigible topped off, and increase the volume for the sake of the occasional load of heavy cargo... 

Many options are available pheromones, magnetic influence, light response, sound... basically anything a plant already responds to can be extruded to a control mechanism given a long enough evolutionary path with a symbiotic species... Our old friend $URL$ could prove a fun option as well... some type of fungus could infect both the plants and the aliens... and allow some manner of shared goal... or more reasonably... enhance the aforementioned interactions... 

Actor? Seems like a pretty perfect fit really... Think about the level of emotion you could get out of a lion and the hours you could work... like Andy Serkis... only without the motion capture suit. 

Look to the oceans There may be plants growing below the icy waters... volcanic activity and warm currents might make for a very green ecosystem below the waves... kelp farming for greens would be viable. Look to the trees Also you mentioned trees... pine nuts and maple syrup and bamboo shoots... non-fruited trees provide food for us already, in a truly fantasy world, designing a tree that provides sustenance while remaining "hearty" shouldn't be an issue. Look in the dirt Green plants not so much, but fungi and tubers growing under the earth can get you starches and vitamins. 

Fighting Each Other I got thinking about the philosophy of fighting in the two component species. Rabbits are mean... they will kick/bite/tear... they will mess each other up. They fight to destroy their rivals. They will kill each others young... hell they'll kill their own young. Deer posture. They fight, but in an attempt to identify which rival is superior, this year. Once decided, they more or less peacefully go their own way. So what does a Jackalope do? Fighting with the intent to maim with ANTLERS... that seems like it would get REALLY messy. But bunnies breed fast, so there will be a whole bunch of fresh combatants next spring. Posturing bunnies are certainly an option... but a pretty boring one. Fighting Prey I was visualizing Jackalopes vs. Predators and I realized something... Rabbits bolt. Hard and Fast... a spooked bunny is just GOING... and they change direction like lightning, reversing their direction effortlessly. Now picture that same bunny with several pounds of antler on its head. I think the youtube videos of "Jackalopes attempting to escape" would be hilarious but really sad. The coyotes would get REALLY FAT. 

Good (effective) answers to this question rarely make good narrative. If Skynet had just poisoned us on day one we wouldn't have ever gotten a movie franchise. Loss of life and planetary destruction avoidance are noble goals... but nothing short of the promise of annihilation is going to get the job done. Ideally, they will surrender completely before anyone dies, but the problem is pulling your punches might make them believe they have a chance, one action big enough to kill everyone in one shot with just enough lead time for them to verify, but not act on. You say wormhole technology exists? Drop a wormhole generator into low altitude orbit with the intent to vent all their atmosphere to the next star system. Give them 5 minutes.
