I was recently convinced to buy a pair of trekking poles for backpacking. But how long should they be? What is the optimal length to adjust my trekking poles, when carrying a heavy pack? I have tried walking around my living room, and I cannot decide what length is ideal. How much does it matter? Should the poles be different lengths for going up or down hill? Does it depend on how much weight I'm carrying? Does the type of handle matter? 

Don't think about the beer bottles being "food". Think about bears being curious. Anything with a scent can attract a curious bear. Maybe your bear has never smelt an IPA before, and will need to investigate the rich scent of hops. Take a quick look at the Yosemite National Park page on bear safety. The short version is: put your empty beer bottles into a bear can or bear locker. 

This is just a climbing terminology question: What is the difference between a Fingerboard and a Hangboard? Maybe there is no difference at all? Maybe it's subtle? I have been Googling around and asking people and have gotten no consistent answer. 

I am not a medical professional and can only offer you anecdotal experience. I have had great success preparing for the ski season by running on steep hills. I found the biggest hills nearby and run on them 2-4 days a week. At first, your legs and your lungs will be killing you. But you will gain muscular and cardiovascular stamina after a couple months. And, as you get stronger, running on hills will just be plain fun. It may not be the easiest solution, but it worked for me. 

I am a decent climber and a better scientist, and I strongly suspect there is no scientific answer to your question. I have been on my long climbs and backpacking trips where I had to carry a pack. The most important factor in how much weight I (or my friends) carried was not height, weight, or gender, it was fitness. Your strength, endurance, and your experience carrying weight will determine how much weight you can carry comfortably. I know this is probably not what you wanted, but I believe it is correct. 

Okay, this is a BIG question. One short post on the internet will not give you everything you need. To that end, I suggest reading some climbing training guides. I have read a few, and find this one to be the best. That being said, in my experience, the important points to hit are these: 

Warning! I am not a medical professional. However, I asked my favorite doctor and she seemed to think it would be okay. She said rust would just look like iron to your body and it would be consumed like food. So, I guess it is safe. (Nota bene, if the container is rusting so extensively you swallow sharp flakes of metal, that is bad. The Chinese used to assassinate people that way.) 

In reality, I do plan better than this. But I believe in being prepared. How do you rappel in the rain? What are the challenges? I assume the problem is that the rope is mad slippery. Is that the only problem? How do you deal with that? 

A wonderful woman I know has the Habenera bag by REI (link). It's a warm bag. We've taken it backpacking in the snow and on mountains, and she likes it a lot. It's also a high-quality, light-weight bag. And it's pink. 

Sure, you can hike Kilimanjaro (~20k ft / 6 km) without any gear. But it takes like a week to get acclimated to the lack of oxygen; how annoying! So, in my opinion, pick peaks under 16,000 ft (4.9 km) and hike in the Summer. If you live in the continental US, all peaks outside of Alaska are under 14,500 ft (4.4 km). If you're in Western Europe it's the same deal, there are no peaks over 4.9 km (16,000 ft). So look on Mountain Project for all the mountains near you and see if they have permanent glacier-cover. That will require crampons. See if other hikers break out rope because the top is crazy steep with sharp drop-offs. Nothing to it, just read descriptions of the hike before you head out. People will say if they think gear was required. 

This book covers it all. Do you need to know about that snake that bit you? Look in here. Did someone fall and break their ankle? This has you covered. Do you have rampant diarrhea? How dangerous is that rash? Will eating snow fix your dehydration? This book will have you covered if you're a dirt bag, weekend climber or a serious, career-long member of search-and-rescue. Admittedly, this book is over 2000 pages long, so you can't take it with you backpacking. And it is no-joke expensive. But if you're committed, this book is the most authoritative source out there. I haven't studied it all, but before going to Joshua Tree I intend to study the Hell out of the chapter on snakes. That is how I use this book, and I have found it very helpful. 

Which dog breeds are best for backpacking? I know malamutes do well in the cold and on mountains, but what if I'm backpacking in the summer? 

It all depends on how you want to mount your rock rings. I mounted mine like this from a door-jam pull-up bar: 

Technique. Climb whatever style of climbing is hardest for you. Are overhung sections hard? Look on YouTube, get your footwork right. Practice the technique until overhung is as easy as slab. Study. Practice. Review. Repeat. Finger Strength. Train your fingers. Finger boards hurt, and are dangerous, but are also the fastest way to see quick gains in your climbing. Be careful! Core strength. Planks, Side Planks, Levers. These are important. Sit-ups and Crunches are useless. General fitness. Get flexible. Work on your upper body strength. Drop your excess body fat. 

Please don't drink alcohol to stay warm. It may make you feel slightly warmer temporarily, but it isn't actually helping you. According to my favourite volume on Wilderness Medicine (page 156), a small nip won't hurt you if you already have a cold-induced injury. However, it is strongly correlated with cold-induced injury, due to the cognitive impairment and loss of pain perception. 

Which dog breeds are good for daily trail runs? I would love a dog that would wake up with me every day and go on a 3 to 7-mile trail run. Somehow, I can't see a Corgi keeping up. 

Snow and Oxygen are the altitude-based problems in mountaineering. At 20,000 feet (6 km) or taller, most peaks are covered in ice all year round. At 16,000 feet (4.9 km) there is so little oxygen you need to take several days to acclimate. Glaciers, steep trails, and scrambles so steep there are no trails mean you have to break out crampons and/or rope. These days I refuse to do anything that includes the word "Crevasse". Look on Mountain Project. 

What gear did John Muir actually take on long trips? I live in California these days, and around here we revere John Muir as a legend of the outdoors. But the legend seems larger than is possible. John Muir is said to have traveled for weeks in the back country, but he never took any food with him, and he never hunted. What did he eat? What gear did he actually take with him? I'd be really interested to see what a serious backpacking gear list was like before the days of nylon tents, space-age rubber approach boots, and carbon fiber hiking poles. 

Last night I had a nightmare that I was 5 pitches off the ground and it started to pour rain. When I woke up I realized I have no idea how to deal with this. Asking around, everyone says two things: 

Personal anecdotal experience: hard cheese: lasts about a week in cool climate boiled eggs: lasts 3 (maybe up to 5 days) before they start to get weird unboiled eggs: I have never even thought of taking them backpacking, but I know they are safe for two weeks unrefrigerated. (This might be a joke to try to carry with you though?) hummus: about a week, unrefrigerated 

Barefoot hiking is fun. I never ran into any problems. If you want to be extra safe, maybe start running barefoot on weekdays. That will build up the callouses on your feet and really help out. I agree with Rory Alsop. Just buy a pair of Vibrams or the New Balance Minimus. There's no reason not to wear the minimal shoes, accept for fun or aesthetic reasons. I've done some very strenuous day hikes in my Vibrams and had a blast. WARNING: Please practice carrying weight before going backpacking barefoot. Hiking while carrying a heavy pack is different from normal walking. All that extra weight means more effort for the muscles and tendons in your feet. This is why "backpacking boots" have such stiff soles: to make it easier on your feet. I would recommend a barefoot day hike with a 30-pound pack as a good test. 

If it has any scent at all, put it in your bear can. If you're worried about cross-contamination between your trash and your food, bring a trash bag you trust. I keep my food in a plastic bag but my trash in gallon ziplocks. When backpacking, my food and trash are separated only by plastic. By the end of the trip, the trash bag is bigger than the food bag. And that's fine. 

This weekend I am going to do one of my favorite things: winter hiking in the Sierras. When I say "hiking", I mean that though we might be trodding up a mountain in the snow, it is not real mountaineering. I won't wear plastic boots and probably won't use my ice axe. I have always loved hiking in the snow. And I have always considered postholing while hiking to be a minor annoyance. But what are the real risks? Do people break their legs postholing through the snow? Should I always wear snowshoes if postholing is likely? Or is this just the minor annoyance I think of it as? 

The idea, from a training perspective, is that if the rock rings are hanging from rope you have to expend more effort with your core to keep your body from swinging. And building core strength is important in climbing. 

First off, let me admit, I have never made crack-climbing gloves with tape. But I have bought a lot of tape over the years, and I have always regretted buying any tape that wasn't climbing-specific. Oh, the tape may make all kinds of claims. But in the end it is always too weak to hold up to granite, or just not flexible enough to keep an injured finger safe. I have not done price-shopping, but I highly suggest you stick with tape made for climbing. Not gymnastics. Not first-aid. Climbing. 

If I spend enough time in the mountains, will my depth perception improve? Are people who are born and raised in the mountains better at perceiving distances in the mountains? 

What altitude-based things make climbing a peak require gear? At what altitude do problems in step 1 start occurring? What non-altitude-based problems might cause a climb to require gear? What peaks nearest me are this height or less? 

Over the next 6 months I will be training for my first marathon. This means I will be running 4 times a week, with at least one long (10-20 mile) run each weekend. I have run several half-marathons before, but each time I lost a lot of my power and strength climbing. I don't want to start from scratch again as a climber. I have worked hard to get what little strength I have and I want to keep it. But how can I keep my climbing strength while training for a marathon? I imagine people are going answer: 

I am planning a multi-week backpacking trip (the JMT in California), and want to bring a real camera. What are some good solar power options for charging my camera batteries on a long backpacking trip? (Just to be clear, my camera is a Sony a7 and doesn't take AA or AAA batteries. It takes those wonky "camera batteries" that you have to charge with a special wall-socket charger.) 

I will try. But last time I lagged behind because I just can't climb hard on a day I've run >10 miles. Will at-home strength-training be the key? How hard will I have to work to just maintain? 

If you want to climb hard, you have to train. This is THE book you need to read. It covers the mental, physical, and technical aspects of climbing. It gives a clear path to improving your climbing and defining your personal training needs. 

If you want a number, falls from over ~5 meters (15 feet) are where you will start to incur more serious injuries. However, you can twist your ankle standing on flat ground. You will know when you start to feel unsafe. At that point, grab a harness and tree-climbing loop. Or just bring a ladder. 

I'm not from the mountains. Every time I go into the mountains I lose all depth perception. I can't tell by looking if a peak is 100 meters or a 1,000 meters above me. I have to stare hard and look for context clues (usually trees). This has led to some hilarious problems. 

The most authoritative source I know is the Wilderness Medicine textbook, and it has some very useful information on this problem. Snow is mostly air. Let's say you stuff yourself full of snow. Unfortunately, the snow you eat is mostly air and not water. So it is extremely hard to get fully hydrated because though you get full, when the snow melts into water you only get a fourth or a fifth of the volume of the snow in water. The solution to this is sometimes quite easy. Dig. If you have no choice but to eat unmelted snow for water, dig down. The deeper you dig in the snow, the more dense the snow is. And when denser snow melts it yields more water. Melt the snow first. Obviously, the ideal solution is to melt the snow first, so you can drink liquid water. The trick here is melting the snow. Wilderness Medicine includes a lot of case reports and has one definite conclusion: PLEASE do not use your body heat to melt the snow. You will increase your risk of hypothermia in a survival situation. Any other method to melt the snow would be extremely helpful to your survival. 

I have gone on several barefoot day hikes and really enjoyed it. Easy peasy. I have a couple of thoughts for you:
