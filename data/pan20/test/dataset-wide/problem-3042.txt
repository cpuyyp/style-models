In 2017, the main threat that North Korea poses to South Korea (aside from the nuclear weapons) is that Seoul is within range of North Korean artillery. For instance (from an article in The Atlantic): 

I'm reading a book on Charles Lindbergh, thinking about his support for non-interventionism leading up to World War II. The America First Committee has a number of prominent names associated with it, so I was led to wonder what their motivations were. It's possible that these people were taking a principled stand against intervention in foreign conflicts (such as might be expressed these days about the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, or Libya), or it might be that they were hoping that Nazi Germany would prevail in its wars. Clearly the answer could be different for different people. I don't know if the movement has been studied in any depth. (Reflections on whether a question such as this can be answered from historical evidence would also be welcome.) 

My question is whether tobacco and marijuana were ever competing products in Europe. It occurred to me that marijuana is an Old World plant, whereas tobacco is a New World plant, and therefore had to be introduced after 1492—by which time I guess marijuana would already have been available in Europe. So it is curious that of two broadly similar products, tobacco was the one that caught on. (I've never tried marijuana, and I have never had a smoking habit, so I'm not sure whether the products are directly comparable, but the general idea of smoking a dried leaf seems similar.) 

$URL$ Happened in 1981 under John Marsh. Remember that the army was doing the crack epidemic thing and was recovering from Vietnam. Probably people were displaying the flag incorrectly and someone decided to make it official policy. 

M. King Hubbert predicted that Soviet oil production would decline as it did, thus implying an economic collapse. 

HE had little to do with the outcome. Japan failed mainly because of American air power and Japan's refusal to press the attack. 

People had all kinds of jobs. One of the interesting thing about engineering before the digital age is that there were whole divisions of workers making graphs and visualizations, and doing calculations. What we would today use a spreadsheet software for, used to be done by hand by dedicated employees. Here is a database of everyone on the project. The project required creation of an entire town, with doctors, entertainment, personal services, etc. There were also foreign spies. 

Here is a diagram of a typical battleship, an Iowa class. As you can see, there's only armor over critical areas like the engine and armament. A shell hit anywhere else isn't going to need to penetrate much steel to deal damage. The cruiser San Francisco actually was disabled by HE, and barely escaped before AP shells could be loaded.

All in all a typical Roman soldier carried On his body 29.4 kg / 64.8 lbs On the rack 18.5 kg / 40.8 lbs Sum 47.9 kg / 105.6 lbs Put this on. Uh, no, you are not simply standing there. You need to move. The normal distance for a Roman soldier during a day was 30 km (19 mi). And when the day ends, well, you need a fortress: 

Yes. No. The problem is the situation in which the Weimar Republic persisted. Germany lost the War and was in a very bad condition. 

As you see, Slavs were then Arians (Caucasians) and Finnish people were Mongols. Also the racists had heated debates which ethnicity belong to which race. So it was not really a problem to "adjust" the race if it suits your interest. 

Reform Judaism does not view the Sabbath as irrevocable holy day and the movement which started mid 19th century grew considerable so that your remark "they were indistinguishable from non-jews European people and led similar lives outside of religious matters" is only valid for this branch. I would even say that the integration and non-conspiciousness of Jews in the modern world (they still follow many rituals and traditions, so you can recognize a Reform Jew if you are a good observer) is only possible with the creation of Reform Judaism. Saturday is therefore not a problem for integration. As reaction the ultra-orthodox Jews (Haredim) were moving in the opposite direction which means separation from other denominations, denial of the modern world and strict observance of Jewish law. The Haredim did not integrate into the western world at all and their distinctive appearance means they are very easy to recognize. The relationship between Haredi and Reform Judaism are for this reason a bit...strained. The rest of the Jews who were more conservative, but would not decline to participate in the modern world are the Modern Orthodox branch. They try to balance the observance to traditional laws and the requirements of modern life. According to the 1990 National Jewish Population Survey a majority of 78% Orthodox jews consider themselves Sabbath observant. 

Bombing was really the only way the Western Allies could attack Germany until mid 1944, so that is what they did. Even in 1945, the Allied controlled ports were operating at max capacity and it was much easier to invest in bombing than building up port capacity to move more troops into Europe. Also, by then the war was practically over, the occupation zones were agreed on, and the Allies preferred air power over land warfare given political pressure for lower casualties. The USSR and Germany had a land border with good supply lines and as a result they had no need for relatively ineffective tactics like strategic bombing. 

$URL$ About 20k children were born, 1k of them black. The white children usually went back to America and grew up with their biological parents. The mixed children generally stayed in the UK due to miscegenation laws in many US states. Took about 5 seconds to google this 

The Germans were enormously outnumbered. They were fighting an opponent with over ten times more oil production. At the time, the US was the largest oil producer in the world. Furthermore, the Allies were the ones focusing on strategic bombing. Germany didn't invest as much resources in air defense because it had a land war in the East going on which was much more threatening. 

I believe that long-range artillery predates the Korean War. This makes me wonder, why did South Korea (and the international military forces) consider this an acceptable situation? Why would they leave the capital city exposed like that? (Was the military cost of gaining further territory too high?) 

I have now read two books from the 1800s in which single young men flirt with married pregnant women. (The first was Anna Karenina, in which Veslovsky flirts with Kitty Levin. The second was Middlemarch, in which Captain Lydgate flirts with Rosamond Lydgate.) The first time I encountered this, I just thought it was strange. When I saw it a second time, I started to wonder if there was a cultural value I was missing. (Without offering a personal reflection, I'll observe that the tone of this Wikipedia article suggests that attraction to pregnant women is a fringe thing in the present-day English-speaking world.) But historically, were pregnant women widely regarded as particularly attractive—to the point where it became a literary trope? 

I've just finished Dorin Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals. The presentation of the book suggested that the Southern states seceded as a response to Lincoln's election. I am confused by that timing: Lincoln seemed to have a very moderate anti-slavery position. He was staunchly opposed to the expansion of slavery to new states, but even years later did not believe that slavery could be interfered with in states where it was established (except as a war power; or unless there was a constititional amendment). 

This guy. 2004, added an antenna. $URL$ It vibrates based on electromagnetic transmissions just for the hell of it. Now the first useful cyborg? Doesn't exist yet. 

This question seems to be attracting poor quality answers. Some tangential discovery by some scientist is held up as being critical to the bomb. This shows a total lack of understanding. Here is some actual background: $URL$ The atomic bomb was an extrapolation of critical pile experiments conducted at various locations in the 1930s. These had little to do with Jews, Szilard, or anything of the sort. The actual development of the bomb again had little to do with Jews. Atomic bombs are quite simple devices, especially the ones used over Japan. They are little more than a ring of explosives or gun that compresses uranium into a small space to attain criticality. It's absurd to claim that any one group of people was essential in figuring them out. There was no way that Germany could ever come anywhere close to developing the bomb because it requires vast amounts of energy to process the uranium. The US created the city of Oak Ridge to get this done, and mined uranium from Canada. Germany had nowhere near that kind of hydro and uranium resource, and the Allies easily destroyed their attempts to build heavy water plants in Norway. In short the accepted answer is completely ahistorical and has no relation to physical reality. No, Jews had no particular essential role in creating the bomb. 

From a German perspective I also think it is unfair to paint Chamberlain as a pacifist who would avoid war at all costs and was unsuitable for the job. He declared war together with France on September 3th, two days after the invasion. If people are unhappy with the "Phony War", I would like to ask what exactly do they imagine what England and France could have done. The border between France and Germany was heavily fortified. So Germany has a very good defendable and prepared choke point with a fully equipped modern army. For people who did not experience war it should be pointed out that most people remembered one of the worst wars 20 years earlier who killed many of their family and friends in the horror of trench warfare and were therefore for a good reason not eager to another war. Moving heavy mobile units or massive infantry was considered impossible in the Ardennes. (which was the reason that Germany's attack was so successful). Moving through Belgium or the Netherlands to attack Germany would violate their neutrality as long as both countries do not agree. This would in return paint a big red target on their chest which a neighbor who defeated the stronger Poland in weeks. Using force would not only make the Allies the aggressor, it would make the "The Rape of Belgium" propaganda of the Allies in WWI ridiculous. The Soviet Union also invaded Poland and shared it with Germany. So the obvious partnership excluded a very advantageous two front war and it also allowed Germany to be supplied with goods. Blockading the North Sea is much now less effective. All points on the western front were also valid for Germany, as France had also strong fortifications and invading the Low Lands again would offer opportunities for France and England to countermoves. So I do not think replacing Chamberlain with Churchill would have any immediate effect and therefore Chamberlain could not be blamed for the inactivity. 

Before germ theory, there were similar concepts of infectious disease- bad humors, bad air, etc. Miasma theory held that decaying organic matter transmitted infectious fumes to other organic matter. Girolamo Fracastoro went further and developed a proto-germ theory in the 1500s. So people got the idea. 

Mussolini was basically someone Hitler bribed to stay on his side. Italy was probably a net burden to the Axis; its main contribution as an ally was as a buffer. Mussolini himself has been survived as grandiose and egocentric, and his rule eventually destroyed Italy. There's your paragraph. Germany sent at least a quarter of its oil production to Italy just to keep Mussolini afloat. Germany also sent some token forces to Africa to delay the British from taking over the African colonies, even though British blockades made this difficult. Eventually Mussolini was overthrown and the new government switched sides. After this point he had little impact on the war and was eventually captured and shot by partisans. The aftermath of his rule was that Italy was totally wrecked and defeated. The only brilliant part is before the war, when he achieved power with his political goalpost shifting and charisma.

The 1920s was when rural areas and smaller urban areas started to get electricity. All major cities had electricty long before then. The minor cities and towns electrified in the 20s are probably too numerous to list. $URL$ The electrical revolution had begun; and like no other force in history, electricity completely transformed how people lived. By turn of the century, residents of every major city in America were enjoying its benefits. In fact, its distribution and application in cities was so universal and met such basic needs that it became an absolute necessity for modern life.3 By the 1930s, however, the failure to electrify the whole country had deprived the millions of people who lived in rural areas of the convenience of a modern standard of living. For nearly half a century while urban Americans enjoyed the pleasures of electricity, rural Americans continued to toil in darkness. 

How did that different perspectives on Heisenberg occur ? Robert Jungk published the (in my opinion excellent) book "Heller als tausend Sonnen" (Brighter than thousand suns) in 1956 about the fate of the atomic physicists working on the bomb. Jungk was strictly against the bomb and Heisenberg claimed in this book that he actively tried to prevent the building of the Bomb. Now Niels Bohr had a talk with Heisenberg and after reading "Heller als tausend Sonnen" he said that Heisenberg had made the exact opposite impression: That Heisenberg supported the bomb and worked full-time on it to guarantee Germanys victory. The Niels Bohr Archive in Kopenhagen has presented the letters of Niels Bohr under $URL$ Heisenberg's letter can be found here (5,6,7): $URL$ The question if Heisenberg did not made himself clear or if Bohr's interpretation is correct is unsolved. Fact is that the German physicists were not able to come up with a working design. 

Now imagine if a Hippie meets a Texas US Trooper. It did not help that most media at that time were right-wing and strictly in favor of police and conservative politicians. So the whole thing was a time bomb which finally exploded when the Persian Shah visited West-Berlin and one innocent person, Benno Ohnesorg, was murdered by the policeman Kurras during the demonstrations. The following protests challenged the old policy in the public opinion and triggered finally a discussion about the handling of WWII and the Holocaust in the public. It also triggered the birth of the RAF (Red Army Faction).
