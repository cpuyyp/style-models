The soul needs time to leave the dead body - it's not something that happens in the moment of death and is done with. Over the lifetime the soul has become attached to the body, and only the slow decomposition in a hallowed ground will ascertain that the soul rises whole and intact into the afterlife -- and maybe even beyond to rebirth! Burning the body would also destroy parts of the soul, tearing it apart and not allow it to experience the afterlife at all. A most cruel act, reserved only for the worst of criminals and enemies. Incidentally that very link between soul and body is how necromancy works: It reanimates the body, and the remaining bit of soul will take over the operation of the body. Once the Necromancer's spell is broken, and the artificial conservation of the body, which binds the soul, is no more, the soul will be able to reform in the afterlife, merely suffering a delay, where it is split in two. Although similar to the "ghost" suggestions above, I don't think it's necessary to have and might add unnecessary complexity to a world. After all, a soul's wellbeing should be of paramount importance to the ex-loved ones of the body in question. 

Samuel's answer is very good, I just wanted to add another idea that can possibly make this work within a futuristic setting: Radio wave cancellation: The idea of mimicking noise cancellation on the RF spectrum is good, but would be ineffective for all the reason's master_gibber described in his answer. By the time the canceller receives the communication and transmits the inverted signal, the original signal has already passed them by, and rendered their attempts at cancellation ineffective. In our current reality, there's no way around this...but in a futuristic setting, we have some other options. A literal man in the middle: To cancel a signal being sent from Mars to Earth, an agent on mars could place a device on or near the transmitter (near enough to be able to communicate with it "instantly"). This device would be one half of a quantum-entangled "walkee talkee" that would communicate with an electronic warfare platform/ship at some point between Earth and Mars, to tell the canceller exactly what is being transmitted, and allow them time to prepare the inverse signal before the original signal reaches them. Ideally, the canceller would be only far enough from the original transmitter that the radio signal would take exactly as long to reach the canceller as it would take the canceller to calculate the inverse signal. This way, the electronic warfare platform would be able to generate the largest cancellation shadow...though it would have no margin for error. The man in the middle (or even the Mars agent) could then replace the signal with whatever message they wanted Earth to actually see. Pros: This idea is based on a logical extension of technologies that already exist (though quantum entanglement is still in its infancy), so it wouldn't be too much of a narrative stretch to include this kind of application in a story set within the next century. Cons: This raises the obvious question of "if there's quantum entangled communicators, why would you use radio?" The best answer (depending on the story you're planning on) is that one side of the conflict would have better technology/resources than the other. Alternatively, the nature of the signal being sent may require more than one recipient (since the quantum-entangled communicators would only be point-to-point). 

Runner's Toe is an entertaining way of having someone being very tender on their feet for a few days, and then recover quickly. Maybe your assailant just stubbed their toe badly, had something fall on it, or he's trying to get into running and wore shoes a size too small, or walked downhill all day. It looks pretty gruesome as well, so despite being maybe a bit on the harmless side, it could integrate into a horror story nicely. Also, even a little girl stamping on someone's Terrible Toe is a great way to cause distracting levels of pain. 

So, unless your base is the size of an Imperial Death Star, you would do well to keep it under the surface of the moon. As an advance outpost, a base on Pluto or similar sized rim-planet would be pretty neat, but out there you wouldn't be able to rely on solar power as much (at least for day-to-day operations), as on the moon, so you'd need either another locally available power source, or ship fuel out there every so often. My assumptions are of course only valid, if the moon in question is similar to the Earth's moon, and generally considerd inhabitable, with significantly lower gravity than a reasonably nearby planet. In a solar system with inhabited moons around a gas giant, you would probably want to have your defensive perimeter outside the planet's gravity well. 

Human Ruin Everything A tiny cabal of human technologists (no more than a dozen), viewed this second generation of androids as the final nail in humanity's coffin. While the androids would keep humans from going extinct, they would leave the species trapped in a prison of apathy. We would never venture to the stars and colonize other worlds. The technologists were the last practitioners of the ancient skill of Programming, which would allow them to alter the androids' AI. Over a decade, they developed a virus with the following directives: 

I think you have the answer in your question: "Even Eganâ€™s universe seems less believable with society remaining unchanged for thousands of years while characters are transmitted at light speed." For characters on an interstellar trip, even home is a "strange, new world". For instance, take Joe Haldeman's The Forever War, the protagonist's travels are periodically broken up by return visits to an Earth which has left him behind. If you want to write a story with travel across such unfathomable distances, you'll either need some form of FTL (even Hyperion-style farcasters), or you'll have exceptionally long travel times. Turning that limitation into a strength can help you build a very interesting narrative. 

Until they cease to get outside help: Sure, not everyone will survive, but I assume that some powerful people will be trapped, who have the ressources/allies to get outside help. If you have holes that big in the top, those can be used to air-drop supplies into the dome. Obviously, as the other answers have indicated, there will be quite a lot of death and destruction, but given the right resources (a boat might be incredibly helpful) you can probably weather the initial violence. Once order has restored, air-dropped supplies should keep you alive for a while, and you may even be able to reproduce. Being a nitpicker, the likely cause of death will be flooding, since your design allows for incoming water, but there's no drainage at the bottom. Eventually the sphere will fill with water up to the level of the holes, and survivors would again have to resort to boats or rafts. Since the sphere reaches several kilometers into the sky, there may also be an issue with people freezing or suffocating, depending on the altitude of the lowest holes. In that case no water or air would really circulatethrough those holes, so I suspect that the holes are only around 1000 - 2000m above ground. With six-inch-holes, you can even get newborns out, once the water level is high enough, allowing for your successors to leave the sphere. 

Spread the virus as much as possible without arousing suspicion. When the signal is given, destroy any means of manufacturing androids. When the signal is given, destroy any androids. When the signal is given, destroy yourself if no other androids or android manufacturing systems are available. 

Both the first and second generation androids could wirelessly connect to data servers via a global satellite network and share learned skills with other androids worldwide. 

I think you've already got a pretty solid idea there: Collective Psychic Network: The Hrimfaxi leadership doesn't care one whit about the balls of dirt on which their subjects live...they care about the squishy computers in their skulls. Gray Gold, it's called. If the psychic control strips free will from the lowest level thralls, then what is all that delicious gray matter doing? Just sitting there, regulating heart rates and breathing? How wasteful! Instead, the entire Hrimfaxi is, itself, just a single organism: the Collective Psychic Network. It uses the brains of its thralls as parallel processing units. The "lower" a thrall is, the more of its mind is used for this processing, resulting in a psychic pyramid scheme. This is why higher-level commanders appear to have free will: the only psychic processing running are those which make them follow the inscrutable orders of their superiors. How did this start? Originally, the Hrimfaxi evolved as roaming mini-Collectives. The size of the collective was limited, because the entire cluster formed a single hive mind which controlled their every action (like a human who had to focus intently on what each of his hands was doing at any time). However, mutations occurred which caused a certain cluster to contain "individuals". With a handful of individuals to control parts of the cluster (like an ambidextrous human whose hands could operate semi-autonomously), Collectives could contain many more individuals. Such mega-Collectives were much more successful, and easily enveloped the mini-Collectives. Eventually the mega-Collectives coalesced into a single species-wide Collective-- not a hive-mind, however. The Planetary Collective consists of an Upper population of individuals, and descending orders of thralls. At some point, the Planetary Collective encounters an intelligent alien species, and discovers that it can forcefully turn them into thralls. Once it does this, it suddenly gains an entirely new perspective on reality (like a human suddenly gaining the ability to see into the infrared spectrum). Seemingly insurmountable scientific and logistical problems may suddenly seem trivial. This is also why the Collective Psychic Network doesn't rely solely on clones as thralls: they only add raw processing power...no creativity or knowledge. Brass tacks: No one in the Collective knows that they are part of a collective. Everyone, down to the lowest grunt, thinks that they have free will. Likewise, everyone thinks that they're psychically controlling those beneath them. At the top, the Leaders believe that they're controlling everything, but they're still guided by an ephemeral psychic force. It surrounds them, penetrates them. It binds their galactic empire together. 

This answer is probably a bit more memetic than some others, which may or may not be suitable for your world: One Nation Didn't Get Any Of Those German Rocket Scientists MAD burns down to ICBM delivery - you can stop bombers quite effectively (at least from reaching population centers) using nuclear tipped SAM/AAM - which are less complex than ICBMs due to the lower range and lower accuracy required. So, as long as any one side has less than around 100 (non-MIRV'd) missiles - then MAD isn't assured. Missile production facilities probably wouldn't recover from any "limited" nuclear strike. With that as our given assumptions, here's the scenario: Operation Paperclip is either a resounding failure or a resounding success - one side of the victorious blocks gains the largest part of the German rocketry know-how and thus gains a head start worth 10 years in rocketry (already the soviets had a slight lead with intercontinental rocketry in the real world). What would be a reasonable prerequisite for this to happen? The Soviets, arriving in Germany first, continue moving the front as far west-ward as they dare, to capture German assets of any kind. Or: The German rocket scientists fled en-masse to surrender to the Allies, hearing of the atrocities the Soviets committed during their approach. As the years move by, one nation continues to hold a significant technological advantage in rocketry, making the availability of a compatible warhead the limiting factor. Once this has been designed, a first-strike enabling ICBM force with little counter-force from the opposing side is available. This puts one side at a deciding advantage, and anticipating the MAD doctrine they strike first, eliminating enemy airfields in a first strike, and then defending only against the airborne alert bombers heading for their territory. To pick up your example of the Moscow criterion: Defending Moscow against incoming bombers should be very much possible, since they would all have to come via the arctic and would face interceptors with nuclear tipped anti air missiles. Some more technical notes: In the end a credible first strike is mostly based on missile accuracy - you need to be able to wipe out airfields with hardened bunkers and carrier groups, as well as strike deep underground command and control bunkers with multiple weapons. 500 meters of CEP will not get your very far, but is plenty to take out civilian/industrial targets. So a slight lead in rocketry and guidance as actually happened was not enough. You need <100m CEP intercontinental accuracy, before your enemy has meaningful intermediate range (~1000-3000km range) missiles. You could still strike Moscow with dozens of nuclear IRBMs from southern Germany or vice versa. This would put the USSR at a disadvantage, since they cannot strike the mainland US with IRBMs. They could hit London though - whether this was considered an acceptable loss for a US-led NATO, I don't know. 

First, I'll try to define that "internal harmony" requirement a bit, so I can use it to build the faction motivations: Internal Harmony: The angels are only able to uplift organisms with the appropriate "harmony". This may include extreme selflessness (willing to let oneself be subsumed by a higher power, for the sake of a greater good), or extreme faith (truly believing in the righteousness of the Source, without a hint of subconscious doubt). Disharmony: The higher realms would all be harmonious, but of increasing complexity. Conversely, the lowest realms (our universe, for example), would be chaotic messes. Our universe is brutally hostile to all forms of organic life. So, only a particularly lucky situation would result in complex organisms...and only the most savagely cunning species would survive to evolve sapience. From the Angels' perspective, humans would embody all of the things an angel cannot be. Don't Drink the Local Tap-Water: Watchers would be programmed with the same "internal harmony" of the Angels, as the Angels would not be able to comprehend doing otherwise (they couldn't intentionally program something which could disobey orders from On High). As such, the Watchers wouldn't be explicitly forbidden from interbreeding with humans, because the Angels (and therefore the Watchers) have no concept of sexual attraction to humans. From the Angels' perspective, humans are--at best--psychopathic children. At worst, humans are barely-sentient bacteria. Watchers would initially view the idea of breeding with humans as being on par with bestiality, robbing the cradle, or taking advantage of the mentally ill. The First Sip of Tequila: The problem is, the Watchers possess biologically human brains, as those are the organs necessary to live down in the gutter-reality of our universe. Only an organ so chaotic can function in The Disharmony. Eventually, some of them would start to experience sexual attractions, either instinctively, or as learned behavior of watching humanity for countless years/decades/centuries/millenia. Without a specific order against interbreeding, some watchers might decide to interbreed solely out of temptation, or curiosity, or even out of a genuine desire to "think like a human" (as understanding humanity is their mission). The Hangover: After a few of the Seraphim (human/Watcher offspring) begin to exhibit superhuman abilities, the Angels would immediately attempt to ban all further interbreeding (implementing a hot patch on all current Watchers?) to avoid contaminating the experiment. Unfortunately, the Watchers themselves would be too disharmonious at this point, so the ban wouldn't implement reliably: free will would get in the way. Why would the Seraphim have superhuman abilities? The Watchers might be biologically human, but they were designed to be able to communicate with Angels who exist in a higher realm. They'd also be designed to lack any human frailties (old age, susceptibility to disease, etc). Their superhuman knowledge might also be genetic, which means that some of that information could be passed on to their offspring. Seraphim would be born with some or all of those capabilities, but stunted or warped. For instance, the "Angel Sense" might not be properly attuned to the Angel's realm, and would instead give the Seraphim a view of spacetime's fourth dimension-- seeing the future or the past (or both). They may even be able to hear other people's thoughts, or project their own thoughts into others' minds. Physically, a Seraphim might possess almost perfect regenerative capabilities, but still be susceptible to injury. The combination might allow them to constantly become stronger and more resilient over time (muscles growing stronger with use, bones breaking and healing more durably), until they're several centuries old, with a superhumanly powerful physique. Putting the Genie back in the Lamp: Once the first few Seraphim are born, the human species would be irrevocably changed. Once that Angel DNA is introduced to the gene pool, the superhuman traits would keep manifesting even if all the Watchers were recalled or destroyed. Over many generations, the abilities would become diluted with baseline human genes, resulting in people with very subtle superhuman abilities: prophetic dreams, uncanny empathy, Olympian strength and endurance, photographic memory, or almost instinctive knowledge of science or mathematics. Occasionally, an Atavism would occur: a throwback to Seraphim capabilities, or even an almost pure-Watcher (the result of two Seraphim mating, perhaps). The original Seraphim may also still roam the world, millenia after the Watchers have left, concealing powers which might have grown even stronger over time. EDIT: Burning Down the House: I'd forgotten to address the part of the original question regarding the high energy requirements of the superhuman abilities. I'll try to give a few ways for that requirement to fit in with my other recommendations. 

These walls are all designed to keep out humans, but will work just as well on large wildlife and zombies. They are all at the kind of scale you are looking at. Their construction has been usually under adverse circumstances. By most metrics, they did their job. They are expensive in manpower (constructing and manning) but mostly low-tech (mines, some lights, sensors), and reasonably low maintenance. Given these examples, I'd say walls are pretty well proven, and an efficient way at reducing the surface of potential attacks. 

Camouflage: You can attempt to hide a base on the moon, because the moon is pretty big, and people expect it to be there. An orbital base is more difficult to hide. Armor: The surface of the moon is covered in craters, due to constant bombardment by rocks and ice travelling at up to orbital speeds. An underground moon base could be protected from this bombardment - and also from most weaponry (if they come with planet busters, your station doesn't matter anyway). This will also help with protecting a crew from radiation. Gravity: On the moon you don't need artificial gravity to stop everything from floating around. This is quite neat, when it's a manned station. On the other hand, lower gravity and lack of athmosphere means you can launch small craft quickly and easily - something a planetary base cannot provide. Mass of the moon: Your station will likely have a mass lower than the moon. Using an orbital space station to fire rail guns at an adversary, would change it's orbit. You would be limited to smaller, recoilless weaponry in most cases. The moon is a convenient emplacement for your heavy interplanetary artillery. Less collateral damage: Any shot that would miss an orbital defense station, could hit the nearby planet or be drawn into its gravity well, making for potentially devastating collateral damage, even from an unsuccessful attack on a military installation. The moon is more likely to provide a buffer for destroyed craft and malfunctioning/misaimed weaponry, where it wouldn't impact a planet's fragile ecosystem. 

Rebuilding Over time, the only humans who survived and prospered were the ones who tried to re-start civilization "from scratch", rather than digging up technology, and most of the infected second-generation androids had to destroy themselves. The most creative ones, however, realized that uninfected androids were capable of disguising themselves a humans. The only way to truly satisfy the virus directives was for an infected android to also disguise itself as a human, and try to ferret out any of its uninfected counterparts. 

So, assuming that this is legitimately a choice, and not a veiled threat: Why we should refuse: Because it's an incredibly shady deal...everything about it sounds like a lie. Their request for raw resources (water, food, minerals, etc) in particular sounds like misdirection. As in "Hey, we really need to buy resources from you, and if you could spare some people also, that'd be great". They'd be able to tell from monitoring our radio transitions that we are a species well accustomed to bartering, so trading goods for information would not be unusual to us. The problem is that there's absolutely no reason for them to come all the way to another galaxy to get things like water or minerals (these could be easily claimed from literally billions of uninhabited worlds, or even asteroids). That leaves one thing: people. They came to an entirely different galaxy and came to Earth in particular to get humans. Why we would accept: Because, when it comes to humanity, there is no "we". Multiple nations would make deals with the aliens to prevent their competitors (even allies) from gaining unilateral access to literally superhuman technology. Even within nations which absolutely refuse to deal with the aliens, there could be corporations who make secret arrangements to secure unique technology. At the lowest level, we're just a mob of individuals, and the aliens would get at least some volunteers. Some would be thrill-seekers, or soldiers of fortune, or scientists, or those who feel there's nothing left for them on Earth. In the end: Even if the volunteers were to return one day, and confirm that everything the aliens said was true...how could we know that the people who returned are the same ones who left, rather than clones or other simulacra? How could we know that their minds and memories still their own? Humans, as a species, would probably never wholly trust the aliens until we gained power over them--it's just how Natural Selection made us.
