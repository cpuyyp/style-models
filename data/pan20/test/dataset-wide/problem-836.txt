This velocity variation has a period of about 27.3 days (sidereal not synodic) with an average diameter of 1/81st the Moon's orbital diameter, or about 9,400 KM, which is about the same distance the Earth orbits around the sun in just over 5 minutes, so, the effect is tiny, and is probably tiny for every planet-satellite system, but feel free to calculate Jupiter-Ganymede or Pluto-Charon if you like. Using the 30,000 km/s approximation, we get 30,045 km/hr at no moon and 29,955 km/hr at full moon or about 3/10ths of 1%, peak to troth, every 13.65 days or so. For comparison, The Earth's perihelion is about 3.28% closer to the sun than it's aphelion, which using Kepler's equal areas law and an approximation of area = 1/2 base x height, the Earth's orbital velocity is about 3.28% greater at perihelion, or about 11 times as much variation in every 182.62 days of elliptical orbit. For the most part, the Earth's orbital velocity isn't that relevant. The Earth's position, not it's velocity, determines which stars or planets you see at night and if the Earth's spans slightly more or slightly less of it's orbit than usual, over a 24 hour period because of the Moon, 5 minutes of fluctuation over 13 days is only relevant to the most rigorous of astronomers. 

light doesn't move slower or faster. it red-shifts when objects are moving away from each other. The faster they move away the greater the red-shift. That's one way relative velocity can be measured. 

Source. I realize that you didn't say explosion specifically, but asked about a source object ejecting material, but both have a similar effect. Ejected material spreads out from it's source. The universe doesn't appear to have been formed in that way. Nice summary of the expansion theory here. That's my layman's understanding anyway and I'm not sure I should have gone there. Origin of the universe questions are kind of out there. 

In space, matter is far more spread out. It's true that a pulsar can light up part of a nebula, though the nebula may also glow on it's own anyway (I'm not 100% sure on that), but a Nebula is very large and very spread out. To see it from the naked eye, I don't think you'd see much other than perhaps a large glow. If you could see a pulsar beam, it takes light 8 minutes to for light to travel 1 AU, and a pulsar can rotate hundreds of times, perhaps thousands of times in 8 minutes, so if you could actually see the beam, it would be enormously curved, like a spiral. The light itself would travel in a straight line but since the source of the light was rapidly rotating it would appear like this (picture below), if there was sufficient material for the light to reflect off of (which there probably wouldn't be, not within 1 AU). 

This is a tricky one because if the sun wasn't going to go Red Giant, the Earth would eventually become tidally locked to the Moon (in 10-50 billion years), and not the sun. If the Earth didn't have a moon, then it could get tidally locked to the sun, in, oh, I don't know, 100-300 billion years as a guess. The Moon is the dominant tidal force on the Earth, so in it's current set-up, the Earth can't get tidally locked to the sun. If the Moon was smaller, then maybe somebody could run the numbers on this question. If the Moon was 1/3rd it's current mass then the Lunar and Solar tidal forces would be similar, and . . . then it becomes an interesting question. Curious sidebar, while the Moon currently stabilizes Earth's obliquity, that's not always going to be the case. As the Moon moves further from the Earth, the Earth's obliquity is expected to show much more pronounced fluctuations, but that doesn't have anything to do with the Earth being tidally locked to the sun. Hope that helps. Corrections welcome. 

The "one time message" idea strikes me as very unlikely because I don't see any point to it. I also don't think a lot of information could be contained in 72 seconds, but some could, but there's no point in sending information for just 72 seconds and just once. The point of sending information is so the person on the other end receives it. But if it was Technology based and not natural in origin, Radio-waves can carry a lot of information, otherwise radios and antenna televisions wouldn't work, but the information is contained in signal variation usually in either amplitude or frequency, like these images below 

Over enough time there is a tendency of all orbiting objects to fall into resonance with the object they're orbiting. 1:1 being is most common. 1:1 usually called Tidal Locking, is quite common. The Moon to the Earth. Pluto and Charon to each other. All four of the Galilean moons are tidally locked to Jupiter, likely others. Mercury's 3:2 ratio is more unusual but not necessarily uncommon, especially for a planet with an eccentric orbit. See Here An eccentric orbit likely helps create a spin-orbit resonance other than 1:1 and resonance other than 3:2 should certainly be possible (the Wiki article implies that) though there are no known examples that I know of.

Asteroids don't "cluster". They're too few and too far apart. A collision of two is possible but rare. A cluster of many, enough to block the sun for 3 hours is impossible. Asteroid collision and a dust cloud is an interesting proposal. Unlikely but worth exploring. Here's a question about asteroid collisions with other asteroids in space. While it's believed that they happen, they're rare events. From the answer: 

Honestly, I think the consequences would be pretty small, except we'd see the dark side of the moon from time to time. On the moon, the consequences would be bigger. All tidally locked means is that the moon's rotation matches the moon's orbit, so that the same side of the moon always faces the earth. If the moon wasn't tidally locked, it would spin from our point of view. The moon spinning wouldn't affect the earth hardly at all - at least, in no way I can see. The reason most moons are tidally locked to their planets is because the planets gravitation on their moons is quite large. Strong gravitation, or, strong tidal effects is perhaps more correct, slows down an orbiting objects rotation, so tidal locking of moons is common. Tidal locking of planets - less so. Both Pluto and it's moon Charon are tidally locked to each other cause they're pretty close to each other. Mercury is also, nearly tidally locked to our sun. Now, Phuc's answer (uh, language please) 

Well, for starters, without a sun there, planets would probably not be visible. If the Neutron Star glowed brightly due to a hot accretion disk you couldn't see anything behind it cause the brightness of it would make seeing light bent around it pale by comparison. Now if the Neutron star was dark, to our eyes, then we could see gravity lensing around it, but stars, not planets cause planets would be dark. (The moon would be very dark too, visible more by what it blocks than what it shines). The lensing would be quite small however. Visible lensing would only be a few times the diameter of the Neutron star, maybe 100 miles across, which, 93 million miles away is really tiny. You might see some odd warping of a star here or there when properly lined up, but to see any interesting visible lensing you'd need a pretty powerful telescope. 

Source The current angle of offset for the Earth's tidal bulge to the Moon is about 3 degrees, often exaggerated in diagrams so it's easier to see. (I should find a source for that - I've not been able to find a good one). From the Moon's point of view (and if we assume a circular orbit), the tidal offset stays in the same place. It's a factor of the relative rotation speed. As Earth slows down, the angle of offset will move towards zero. At tidal locking, the angle of offset becomes zero and there's no force to continue in the other direction. In a simple mathematical model, tidal locking wouldn't ever happen completely, it would just gradually get closer and closer, like an object shot from the Earth at exactly escape velocity. In reality, because objects aren't perfectly symmetrical and because orbits aren't perfectly circular, the "take forever to get to zero", doesn't happen. But it's still a gradual approach to zero and no overshooting and returning because the force on the rotation approaches zero as the angle of offset approaches zero and the force needed to change a planet's rotation is enormous and there's essentially zero force to make that happen. With more eccentric orbits, like Mercury and it's 3:2 rotation to orbit resonance, that might be different. Not sure how eccentricity might play into this. That's more complicated. 

Mars, from our point of view, slows down, temporarily reverses direction then returns to it's original direction and continues on. The entire "S" motion takes maybe 3-4 months and your 2 photos are 24 days apart. (but this won't happen till May 2016) 

Sudden appearances happen. That's not to say something suddenly appears out of thin air, er, space, or quantum improbability or some kind of other dimension nonsense, but "it suddenly appeared" is actually somewhat reasonable because space is big and dark and something going unnoticed until it's right on top of us, is in the realm of possible. The Chelyabinsk meteor of 2013 is an example of a destructive object just "appearing" in the sky because, as a sun-side meteor it was harder to see and it was smaller than the meteors that NASA tracks, so nobody saw it coming until it was a bright flash in the sky. 

exo-solar objects approach the solar system in a mostly straight line until they get close enough for the sun to bend their path. Where they came from before their direction was curved by the sun's gravity is their radiant. 

That's only talking about this particular situation and there's a difference between disintegrate and decay. This planetoid is enormously close to the white dwarf. So close, that what we think of as normal white dwarf/planet dynamics (very cold) is no longer true. This planetoid is slowly being vaporized. Looking at the orbital period of 4.5 hours (about 1948 orbital periods in 365.25 days). The orbital distance to orbital ratio relation is exponential to the power of 2/3 (this varies a bit due to eccentricity, but it's generally correct), so an orbital period 1948 times faster means about 156 times closer, and giving the white dwarf equal mass to our sun, that puts the planetoid at a bit under 1 million KM. If this white dwarf is lighter than the sun, the planetoid would need to be even closer. That's close to the Roche limit and would be inside it if the planetoid wasn't dense and rocky/metallic. If we estimate the white dwarf to be about the size of the Earth, which is a common size given for white dwarfs, An Earth sized object from 1 million KM would be larger in the sky than the sun appears from Earth, and presumably quite a bit hotter than the surface of our sun too, so this isn't a tiny white dwarf in the sky from the perspective of the planetoid. It's a blazing furnace of a sun, so hot, it vaporizes metallic gas and dust off the surface of the planet. The article mentions this (end of page 3), that Poynting-Robertson drag see here and here, and that may be a factor in any orbital decay in this scenario. The article is clear that there's a good deal of uncertainty on with that effect, and that only affects tiny particles, but enough tiny particles could create a drag over time. . . . (maybe). The general scenario with this orbit is a planet scorched and as a result, is losing material. It's likely the very high heat that's driving any orbital decay, not gravity. Gravitational decay / orbital decay does happen, usually much more slowly. That's probably not what's happening here. There are some interesting orbital effects that can happen when a main sequence star goes red dwarf and later when it creates a planetary nebula, significant increases in tidal forces due to the star's greater size in the first case and increased drag in the 2nd, but at the white dwarf stage, there's no significant orbital decay effects.
