Nothing will really happen. Most secure system have a 2 party login, your bank have a token, where you need the token and the password to get in. Every time the token changes so you have to make the right guess at the first try. Lets say you could make a qualified guess with the right algorithm, you still would only have a limited amount of attempts before the account is closed down, because the intrusion counter measures kicks in. Then the next step would be to try and kick in the door. Well, unless you are able to pick out the data and move it physically to your device, then the bandwidth of the unit stored on it (High end PCI harddrive makes about 250.000 operations per second) would make it a major slow down. Doing this over the internet would be even worse, asuming you had the bandwidth you would just make one HUGE DDOS attack on the world. My conclusion is: Unless you have the data directly on your device (and it could take months to transfer, because of this google even fedexed nasas website to them self), it would be useless, and if you have access to the raw data, well you don't need a fast computer to break in to it. It would be like have a F1 car on the Faroe Islands. (More about fast cracking computers and its problems here) 

One of the cities in my world is built on the ground floor beneath and around giant tree. Giant tree cities seem to pop up fairly frequently in science fiction and fantasy, but how would they actually work and how would the city be designed? An obvious question seems that of sunlight. How much would be blocked out by the tree, and what effect would this have on the city? It's also possible that the tree could shed leaves in the fall, but that would depend on the type of tree. Are there any other concerns for a tree based city? (BTW - the world includes magic and is currently at about 1500s technology level) 

I agree with the other answers that with a ship that large, you could probably bring along a variety of animals. But for a new perspective, I would suggest thinking about potential pest problems. If you have that many people on a ship, you will likely have some pests - rats, mice, roaches, and so on. Why not bring along pets that will help keep down the pests? Cats that are good at catching rats and terrier dogs breed for this purpose would be ideal. You could genetically modify these species to be better at preforming their tasks. Actually, I would consider broadening this answer to include other pets that double as working animals. Would you have a disabled population that could use seeing eye dogs and the like? What about dogs trained to sniff out explosives or gas leaks? 

This would be the first thing i would look for. It is a small tent trailer, it is so small it can be drawn by 2 humans easily, one horse, cow, donkey, 2 large sheeps or goats, it can be drawn from a scooter, snow scootter, motorcycle - you name it. 

Blackdamp is the condition where the breathable oxygen is removed from the air underground. Causing asphyxiation in humans and humanoids. Normally seen in modern day mines. The base area of the dwarven fortress is almost mined out and the dwarves are looking to other places to expand their empire, the idea is to go down, but they started to struggle with breathing so the dwarves goes to the drawing board. 

To those who does not know what transcendence traveling is, it is when you move from one plane to another to move a distance across that plane just to pop in to your own again. To free your self of the constrains of the real world to make the travel. Imagine a triangle, you start at one corner to move towards another corner, you have 2 paths you can move, either down or across, If you move across it takes you 2000 years to move, but if you move down the way across it gets shorter. making the distance traveled a lot shorter. 

In the world I'm building, there's a non-human race that I want to have no concept of gender. Their language doesn't contain gendered words like "man" or "woman," and sexual attraction is not based on biological sex. They are roughly humanoid in shape - two legs, two arms, stand upright - but have very few characteristics that would distinguish biological sex. How would such a species develop? One possibility that occurred to me is that they don't reproduce at all like humans and have only one biological sex, but I'm not sure how this would work for a species that's vaguely mammalian. They may have had genetic engineering at some point in the distant past (thousands of years ago), but certainly no longer have it, if that changes anything. Edited to specify that I'm asking about gender not biological sex. The two are different. The species I'm developing has no concept of gender, but they could still have two biological sexes. 

Sheep reproduces fairly quick compared to other livestock. It produces wearable cloth without slaughter the animal. It can also produce milk. If you have a population you need to feed and an easy way to do it, sheep is your go to animal. Sheep's are also able to live in most environments, the wool keeps them cold in warm areas, and warm in cold areas. As an added bonus, sheeps eats almost anything, but if there is too little area for the sheeps to feed they will leave the soil barren and muddy. 

Since one of the Romans preferred fighting techniques were the shieldwall, a large improvement would be to have a shield that you could see through. Giving the opportunity grab the opponent and stab him, so on and so forth. 

I was going to be flippant and say: flood the market with romance novels. However, that might be headed in the right direction if True Love is psychological rather than some mystical compatibility. You can run compatibility tests, keep a database. Build up true love in stories, TV, Movies, etc. In the early years let the kids know that there are compatible matches for them but keep them apart (straight/gay, same methodology). However, leave holes in the separation that allow the clever and/or persistent to find their mates. The expectation raised plus the effort of overcoming the barriers to meet will make their meeting special. For those who don't pass the first test, have a big ceremony where they are introduced to their best matches. You might not get as many hits here but it gives another chance at finding matches. Also, some people are conformists and would respond well to this. Look for other methods of matching people up. After each method, you have a smaller and smaller pool of those who have not found true love yet. 

As you can read the heat and pressure is pretty impressive, you just need to increase the size of the shrimp - make it human and give it super powers, combine it with the XKCD - WHAT IF, and then you would have a pretty good idea. The math i will leave to someone more capable. 

Change charging culture, i assume most of us charge our cellphone at night. Charging your cellphone, laptop and electric car during the day so the power last most of the night. Maybe even distribute storage. (1 HUGE government power-bank = expensive, 10.000.000 personal power-banks is more expensive but only for individuals) the power banks would be charged during day and used during nights, fail-over power would be available during night in case the power-bank would run out but at a higher cost. I see where you are going, but i would like to point out that having eco power could also include wind-power, checkout french tree turbine and tell me it isn't awesome. 

I'm writing about a human community (all immigrants or descendants of) in what is basically an elfin city. The main political question facing the community is isolation versus assimilation, but I think it needs some other controversies as well (and this could go for other communities in the world, such as the city at large). Problem is, most of the potential issues and controversies that spring to mind are those from 21st century America, but those would not all apply to this community. Different sexual orientations are completely accepted. Women are politically and socially equal to men. The community is mainly middle class and doesn't have large income inequalities. Racism isn't common - they have far more in common with the other humans than the elves. What sort of topics would be debated politically? What areas should I be looking at to figure out their hot button issues? I've already come up with a few, but it'd be good to see if there's any obvious ones I'm missing. 

Temperatures, computers does not run well under extreme temperatures, or extreme weather conditions. 

you answered it your self. Our sole means of surviving viruses is our difference, that someone out there is immune or resistant to a virus. If everyone had the same genetic materials it would be a global whiteout at the next epidemic Lets evolve the idea What if we had a genepool - like literally - a huge tub where people added genes to then create a clone, add more genetic materials - so everyone had their own genetic material. But then we are back to square one except without the fun part. Accelerated growth is not a good idea. Many experiments about the human brain along with raising one as a person, somewhat indicate that a human mind will not be able to evolve it's brain and personality fast enough to support an accelerated growth. So now we are back to a place where doing it the old fashion way is the best idea. Unless you want a bunch of fast evolved maniacs, that will perish at the first biological attack that will hit them. 

One reason for only one colony ship is that it may be the only one left. The presupposes that there is only one known good destination. 

For finances, put everything in corporations in trusts. Then you can change the owner of the trust. She could probably make it to 50 years old without drawing too much attention. So, she should plan ahead. Raise a daughter, keep her in the loop and at some point switch places with her or her granddaughter. Have a big family and become the secret patriarch of that family. You can't do it without help and family can be the best help. Go around saving children. You never know when that might come in handy in the future. 

Also remember that the windows are plastic. Once the plasticine leaks out, they will become very brittle. Then the flexing of the aircraft frame will crack and, eventually, destroy the windows. The wings, unless supported would eventually droop to the ground. The landing gear is pretty robust but it is bolted onto the frame. I think that those mounting points will go. I think that, if you are lucky, after 5000 years, you will have a sagging aluminum tube with holes in it, resting on the ground. 

I'm working on creating a race of humanoids with "hollow" bones like birds (they have criss-crossing struts for internal support). They are short - an individual is unlikely to top five feet. Would this species be significantly more prone to injury than regular humans? Could they still participate in athletic activities? Also, would this bone structure have an effect upon their culture? 

I have an alien species that while similar to humans in many ways have mouths that are closer to muzzles. In short, they do not have cheeks like humans do. I realize that this will effect the sounds they are able to produce and thus their language. Most of their speech will be translated, but I want to know what English language sounds they would be capable of making so that I can give them semi-plausible names that won't baffle English speakers. One sound set that has already occurred to me is "p" and "b" - both are created largely with the lips. What other English language sounds would not be possible for a species without cheeks? Note - the species does have vocal cords and tongues. The only major difference is lack of cheeks.
