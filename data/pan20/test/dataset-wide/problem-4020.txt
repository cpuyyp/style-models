Note that in the finitely generated case the restricted completion is the same as the profinite completion, thus one does not need to use the Schreier basis in this case. Therefore it suffices to affirmatively answer the following. 

A result of Harman and Katai tells us that if $n$ is large, and $A$ is a subset of $\{1,\ldots, n\}$ is of size $|A|=r<c \sqrt{n}/\log n$, then the number of primes up to $N=2^n$ with the $j$-th binary coefficients being prescribed is about $2^{-r} N/\log N$. See Bourgain for recent developments. My question is whether one can do a similar result with two bases; namely, to simultaneously prescribe some of the coefficients, say, in both the binary expansion and the ternary expansion? 

I always thought that it is called Abhyankar's lemma (and indeed it is a special case of it, see $URL$ My question is whether this statement is indeed named after Abhyankar. If so, a reference would be appreciated, if not, how is it called? 

Several cases of the Bateman-Horn conjecture on prime values of polynomials are quite different. See the paper by Conrad, Conrad, and Gross in $URL$ 

Let $G$ be a primitive permutation group of degree $n$, that is $G$ acts transitively and faithfully on a set consisting of $n$ elements and $G$ preserves no nontrivial partition of $X$. In a sense primitive groups are the 'simple' permutation groups. For example one can show that a primitive group has at most 2 minimal normal subgroups. this can be regarded as a 'width' result. My question is about the 'depth', namely: Let $G$ be a primitive permutation group of degree $n$, Let $1\lneq G_m\lneq \cdots\lneq G_0=G$ be a strictly decreasing sequence of normal subgroups of $G$. Is there a good bound for $m$ in terms of $n$? A stupid bound is $m\leq \log_2(n!)$. My guts feeling is that $m$ should be at most $n-1$, because it feels that every subgroup in the sequence should contribute at least one element to the orbit of a point. Edit: I ran a computer check in the meanwhile up to degree $n=50$, and it turns out that $m$ is bounded by $n-1$ in this region. Moreover $m$ grows much slower than $n$, e.g., it never exceeded $7$. 

If the characteristic of $K$ is NOT $2$, or if $n$ is odd, then the splitting fields are linearly disjoint for arbitrary $\Omega$. Thus, I pose the question the specific case of $p=2$ and $n$ even. The answer cannot be ALWAYS, as in the previous remark. Indeed, one can show that if $p=n=2$, $m=4$, and $\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \omega_3 + \omega_4 = 0$, then the splitting fields are not linearly disjoint. In fact, if $p=n=2$, the answer is that the splitting fields are linearly disjoint if and only if the sum of any even number of elements of $\Omega$ does not vanish. How one proves 1 + 2: The linear disjointness of the splitting fields can be reduced to the linear independent of the discriminant as elements in $H^1(K,\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$. If $p\nmid n$, then one can use ramification theory to achieve this, if $p\neq 2$ but divides $n$, one can calculate this by hand using the formula given by the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. If $p=2$, I know of no formula for the discriminant in terms of the coefficients. However when $p=n=2$ situation is simple enough to do calculations and hence get 2. 

What about the symmetric group $S_n$ being solvable if and only if $n<5$ (it can be stated as a dimension phenomenon, if one really really wants to) 

The Riemann-Hurwitz formula implies that the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1_K$ over any algebraically closed field $K$ is simply connected (i.e., $\pi_1^{et}(\mathbb{P}^1_K) = 1$; equivalently, if $\phi\colon C\to \mathbb{P}^1_{K}$ is finite etale, then $\deg\phi=1$). For $K=\mathbb{C}$, this follows from the connection with topology and from the fact that the complex plane $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$ is contractable. In positive characteristic the affine line is not simply connected due to Artin-Schreier covers. My question is whether there is a short proof for this fact in positive characteristic? 

I want to ask who was the first to use cut-paste construction in Galois theory. This question is motivated from the trend in contemporary Galois theory to use patching methods to construct Galois extensions with a given group. For example, Harbater used formal patching to solve the inverse Galois problem over $\mathbb{Q}_p(x)$. Those patching methods are in analogy with the `classical' cutting and pasting constructions of differential geometry. In particular, the proof of Riemann Existence Theorem (saying that there are covers of Riemann surfaces with given groups and ramification) invokes such construction. Was Riemann the first? 

Even much stronger statements are nearly immediate consequence of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. For example: Choose any $f_1$, $f_2$ coprime of $g$, then by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem there exist infinitely many $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $$g(X)+a f_1(X) \quad and \quad g(X)+a f_2(X) $$ are both irreducible. Similarly there exist infinitely many $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $$ (a f_1)^2 + 1 $$ is irreducible (this is an analogue of a problem of Landau asking whether there are infinitely many primes of the form $n^2+1$). More generally, a Shinzel Hypothesis H version for $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ is nearly immediate from Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. Edit: Hilbert's irreducibility theorem asserts that for every $F_1(T,X),\ldots, F_r(T,X)\in \mathbb{Q}(T)[X]$ that are irreducible, there exist infinitely many $t\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that all $F_i(t,X)$ are (defined) and irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. 

Let $p$ be a large prime parameter and $V\subseteq \mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ a variety defined over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ with bounded degree and dimension (w.r.t. $p$). Assume that $V$ is absolutely irreducible, and so the Lang-Weil estimate implies $$\#V(\mathbb{F}_p) = p^{\dim V} (1+O(p^{-1/2})).$$ In particular, there are $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points on $V$ if $p$ is sufficiently large. I want to find points with small coordinates. A more precise formulation: How small can $1\leq B(p)\leq p$ be such that there exists a rational point $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\in V(\mathbb{F}_q)$ with all $1\leq a_i \leq B(p)$? I am aware that in the special case of hyper-ellicptic curves it relates to the least quadratic nonresidue, to short exponential sums, and to the Burgess bound; this question asks what happens in the general case (for me it suffices to consider singular complete intersections with singular locus of co-dimension 2, but I think it shouldn't be easier than the general case). 

Let $X,X'$ be locally compact abelian groups with a non-degenerate quadratic form $\left<\bullet ,\bullet \right>\colon X\times X' \to \mu_{l}$, where $l$ is a prime, and $\mu_l$ the group of $l$-roots of unity. For a closed subgroup $X_0\subseteq X$, denote by $X_0^{\perp}= \{x'\in X': \left<X_0,x'\right>=1\}$. I look for a simple proof, or a reference for following statement, that I couldn't find in the literature: Theorem: $X_0=X_0^{\perp\perp}$ for every closed subgroup $X_0\leq X$. 

Dror Speiser suggested to me that maybe a different question lies behind this one. Namely, instead of $F_2$, perhaps, it was meant to consider the profinite completion $\widehat{F_2}^{profinite}$ of $F_2$ (which is the etale fundamental group of $\mathbb{P}^1\smallsetminus\{0,1,\infty\}$). In this case the natural map $\widehat{F_2}^{profinite}\to \widehat{F_2}^{prosolvable}$ is not injective, for, essentially, the reason that was mentioned in the question, i.e., since there are covers of $\mathbb{P}^1\smallsetminus\{0,1,\infty\}$ with non-solvable Galois groups. Here $\widehat{F_2}^{prosolvable}$ is the prosolvable completion of $F_2$. If this was indeed what was mentioned, then the kernel is well understood, namely it is the free pro-$\mathcal{C}$ group of countable rank, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the family of all finite groups whose decomposition factors are non-cyclic. I can't seem to find the reference to the paper that proves this at this moment, but if it interests someone I can look harder. Regarding the minimal length of a word in the kernel, it will be infinite, exactly for the reason Andy Putman explained. (An example for a nontrivial profinite word in the kernel is something of the form $[\cdots [[[[[x,y],x^2],y^2],x^3],y^3],\cdots]$, where the powers are growing so that it will converge. I didn't check that this element really works.) 

This is not correct. If it was the compositum then you would get that the absolute Galois group is a product of pro-$p$ group and pro-$p$' groups (i.e. inverse limit of prime to $p$ finite groups). This is obviously wrong, since for example, if you take prime $\ell$ such that $p=1\pmod \ell$. Then the nonabelian group $C_p \rtimes C_\ell$ (with respect to an embedding of $C_{\ell}\to Aut(C_{p})$) is realizable over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q((t))$ but is not a product of $p$-group and prime-to-$p$ group. BTW: $C_m$ denotes a cyclic group of order $m$ 

I think the answer is yes, that is that the absolute Galois group of $K((t))$ is not finitely generated: Consider the equations $X^p-X=t^{-r}$, where $r$ runs over prime-to-$p$ positive integers. Then each equation will generate a wildly ramified $Z/pZ$-extension of $K((t))$. The extensions will be distinct due to Artin-Schreier theory. The answer came after a discussion with Aaron Silberstein. 

An hyperoctahedral group $G$ is the wreath product of $S_2$ and $S_n$, where $S_{n}$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters, or in other words the semi-direct product $G=S_2^n\rtimes S_n$, w.r.t. the action on the indices. $G$ comes with a natural action on $[2]\times [n]$, so we consider it as a subgroup of $S_{2n}$. $G$ has two normal subgroups of index two, the first $N_1$ is the preimage of $A_n$ under the quotient map $G\to S_n$ and the second $N_2$ is the intersection in $S_{2n}$ of $G$ and $A_{2n}$. This immediately gives a third normal subgroup of index two, coming from the diagonal in the Klein group $G/(N_1\cap N_2)$. 

I'm posting this question on behalf of someone without access to mathoverflow: Can anybody give me a reliable reference (not a proof) to the following statement? Up to isomorphism, there are only finitely many Weyl groups of reductive algebraic groups of rank r. 

As anyone who follows the arxiv, I notice every now and then "proofs" and "disproofs" of Riemann Hypothesis. I looked on several such articles, and it seemed to me quite nonsense, but I didn't make the effort to find a mistake. My question is whether someone reads these "proofs"? BTW, I wanted to refer to some of these papers in the arxiv, but it turned out that there are too many of them. 

Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of global fields with Galois group $G$. Assume that for a prime $p$ of $K$ we are given the datum $(L_{p}(s,\rho))_{\rho}$, where $\rho$ varies over the irreducible representations of $G$ and $L_{p}(s,\rho)$ is the Euler factor in the sense of Artin; i.e. it is the reciprocal of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius $\sigma_p$ after we restrict $\rho$ to the decomposition group $D$ and then we replace $\rho$ with the representation of $D/I$ on $V^I$, where $I$ is the inertia group. So in formulas $$L_{p}(s,\rho) = \det ({\rm id}_{V^I}- X\cdot \rho(\sigma_p)|_{V^I} )^{-1},$$ where $X=N(p)^{-s}$. (Here $V=V_{\rho}$ is the underlying space of the representation.) My question: Does this datum encode the relative degree and ramification index of the prime $p$? 

Following Steinberg comment: If $F$ is free profinite group of infinite rank, and $G$ is projective of rank at most the rank of $F$, then the free product is free. Indeed, it is quasi-free (in the sense that every finite split embedding problem has the rank many solutions) and projective, so free. Edit: Here are some more details: Let $H$ be the free product of a free profinite group $F$ of infinite rank $m$ and a profinite group $G$ of rank at most $m$. Claim: $H$ is quasi-free of rank $m$. Proof: If $\alpha \colon H\to A$ and $\beta \colon B\to A$ are two epimorphisms of profinite groups with $B,A$ finite and $\beta$ not an isomorphism, and if $\beta$ has a group theoretic section $\gamma\colon A\to B$, then we can construct $m$ distinct solutions as follows: Since $F$ is free we have $m$ distinct solutions to the restricted EP: $\alpha|_{F}\colon F\to \alpha(F)$ and $\beta'\colon \beta^{-1}(\alpha(F))\to A$, denote them by $\psi_i\colon F\to B$. Then for each $i$, $\psi_i$ and $\gamma\circ \alpha|_{G}\colon G\to B$ define a homomorphism $\Phi_i\colon H\to B$, by the universal property of free products. Clearly the $\Phi_i$ are distinct (since there restrictions to $F$ are $\psi_i$). Since $\psi_i$ is surjective, $\psi_i(F)$ contains the kernel of $\beta$, hence also $\Phi_i(H)$. But $\beta(\Phi_i(H))=\alpha(H)=A$, so $\Phi_i(H)=B$. This finishes the proof of the claim. Now if in addition $G$ is projective, then clearly $H$ is projective, hence by the theorem Benjamin Steinberg mentioned above that says quasi-free+projective=free, $H$ is free. 

Take a random polynomial $f$ with integer coefficients (e.g., choose coefficients between $1$ to $B$ of a fixed degree $n$ and let $B$ tend to $\infty$). Using computer we noted that the 2-valuation of the polynomial tends to be even, and much larger than one may naively expected. Are there results about the 2-valuation of the discriminant (other than the classical result that it $\equiv 1, 0 \mod 4$)? Here is some data for degree = 10, B=1000, we chose 100,000 random polynomials and the following is a list of 2-valuation: [50156, 0, 12231, 4191, 10462, 2551, 5974, 1034, 4435, 1105, 3107, 984, 1283, 447, 672, 337, 356, 150, 171, 88, 94, 41, 43, 20, 28, 14, 5, 6, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1] 

If you take $E$ be the fixed field of the stabilizer of a point, then $[E:Q]=6$ and $L$ is the Galois closure of $E$. So $L$ is the compositum of the Galois closure of one field of degree $6$. 

If $K$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$, then $K((t))$, the field of Laurent series with coefficients in $K$, has infinitely many Galois extensions of degree $p$. Indeed, since the field $F_{p^n}$ with $p^n$ elements is contained in $K$, the Galois group of the polynomial $X^{p^n}-X=t^{-1}$ is isomorphic to the additive group of $F_{p^n}$, i.e. to $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$. Therefore the absolute Galois group of $K((t))$ is not finitely generated. Note that this argument only uses the fact that $K$ contains $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for infinitely many $n$'s. My question is whether the same holds true for arbitrary $K$ of positive charactersitic (perhaps we need to further assume that $K$ is infinite?). Note that if $K$ is of characteristic $0$, then the restriction map $r\colon {\rm Gal}(K((t))) \to {\rm Gal}(K)$ of the absolute Galois groups is surjective and split. If the same would have hold for $K$ of positive characteristic, we would in particular have that $K((t))$ has infinitely many extensions of degree $p$ (not necessarily Galois) and hence ${\rm Gal}(K((t)))$ is not finitely generated. However, I think that $r$ may not split in positive characteristic, since the proof that $r$ splits in characteristic zero is based on the fact that $\mathbb{A}^1_K$ is simply connected, and this fact fails if ${\rm char}(K)>0$. 

I ran into the following problem. I have some lengthy paper in which I develop some theory to attack some problem. While I was working on this paper, I got some nice result which might interest a bigger audience and can stand by itself (that is, it is interesting out of context of the big work, and has a fairly short proof). The problem: should I write one long paper or two papers, one long and the other short? If I write just one paper, the short result will strengthen the paper, and it will be, perhaps, more whole. On the other hand, for someone that is only interesting in the short one, it will be better if it appears in a separated paper. 

I will try to answer my question, at least on how to recover $e$, following a discussion with Chantal David on this. First put $n=[L:K]$, $e_p$ the ramification index of $p$, $f_p$ the relative degree (aka, inertia degree, aka residue degree), and $g_p$ the number of primes of $L$ lying above $p$. Then $$ \frac{\zeta_L(s)}{\zeta_K(s)} = \prod_{p} (1-N(p)^{-f_p s})^{-g_p}(1-N(p)^{-s}). $$ (Here $N(p) = |O_K/p|$.) On the other hand, Artin proved that $$ \frac{\zeta_L(s)}{\zeta_K(s)} = \prod_{\rho\neq \rho_0}\prod_p L_p(s,\rho)^{\dim \rho}, $$ where $\rho_0$ is the trivial irreducible representation. So comparing these locally (at our $p$) and introducing a new variable $u=N(p)^{-s}$, we get that $$ (1-u^{f_p})^{-g_p}(1-u) = \prod_{\rho\neq \rho_0} L_p(s,\rho)^{\dim \rho}. $$ Comparing degrees in $u$ gives that $$ 1-g_pf_p = \sum_\rho \dim\rho \deg_u L_p(s,\rho) $$ so that we recovered $g_pf_p$ and thus also $e_p=\frac{n}{g_pf_p}$. 

Edit: Recently Joachim König solved this using the classification both in the induction basis as Michael Giudici mentioned and also in the induction step. I guess we should wait for the paper which is now in refereeing process. 

Let $f$ be a polynomial over a field $K$ of degree $n$ such that $f(x^2)$ is separable. Assume that the Galois group $G$ of (a splitting field of ) $f(x^2)$ is maximal, that is to say, the wreath product $G= C_2 {\rm wr} S_n$. (In particular, the Galois group of $f$ is $S_n$.) The action of the group $G$ on the roots of $f(x^2)$ coincides with the imprimitive action of the wreath product. My question is whether there is a natural set with Galois action which corresponds to the primitive action of the wreath product. 

Let $k$ be any field and $K=k((x,y))$ the fraction field of the ring $k[[x,y]]$ of formal Laurent series in two variables. Then Harbater and Stevenson proved that the absolute Galois group of $K=k((x,y))$ is quasi-free of rank equal the cardinality of $m={\rm card}(K)>\aleph_0$. In particular, for any nontrivial finite group $G$, there exist $m$ distinct Galois extensions of $K$ of Galois group $G$. In fact, these extensions can be chosen to be linearly disjoint (since the absolute Galois group is even "semi-free", as was shown by Harbater-Haran and myself). In particular if one takes $k$ to be a finite field, then $K$ is local field of dimension $2$. 

Here is a result of Haran that might be relevant : For almost all $\sigma$ in the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ the fixed field $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}^\sigma$ of $\sigma$ in $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ has no proper cofinite subextensions. (I.e. $L\subsetneq \bar{\mathbb{Q}}^\sigma$ implies $[\bar{\mathbb{Q}}^\sigma:L]=\infty$.) Here almost all is in the sense of the Haar measure on the absolute Galois group.
