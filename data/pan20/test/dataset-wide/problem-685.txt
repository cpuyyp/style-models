I'll answer that rather than comparing the benefits of the two options. I'll open with saying I think are a few more decisions, but this is a start. Good luck, and whatever you face at this juncture, don't let it stop you - riding a bike changes lives and saves the planet. You need to decide how hard you want to work when riding. You need to decide how far you'll be biking and how long your rides will be. You need to decide if you're willing to walk if your single speed gets too difficult. You need to decide if you're getting the bike to get into shape or to take leisurely rides. (In other words, does working harder than mechanics might allow bother you?) You need to decide if you accept the additional complexity and maintenance of a multi-geared bike (marginal as those might be). If you settle on a geared bike How small the intervals between your hardest and easier gear do you need. How small the intervals between your hardest and easier gear do you want. You need to decide if you accept the additional complexity and maintenance of additional gears (marginal as those might be). 

There is nothing wrong with a tube that inflates unevenly outside the tire. That is to say, this symptom alone does not prove a problem. Perfectly fine innertubes inflate unevenly. If the tire is seated properly, and the bead is hooked into the rim, a mis-shapen inner tube will not be enough to create a perceivable bump on the tire. However, any number of slight defects in a tire can cause a perceptible bump no matter how great the tube is. 

The one that fits. You've got a wide range there. I don't know of a tri-bike that's going to fit an 8 year old. By 15 the kid should be ready for an adult bike. Somewhere in between an extra small road bike is going to be the best option. AFAIK, 43cm is as small as you'll get. A search for 43 cm road bike will get you on your way. 

A company called Pacsafe makes a steel mesh web/net that fits around a backpack and can be used to lock it down. You might find a shape that works for your stuff. It's more of a deterrent than a guarantee but it's a worthy solution. Here is a link with a good picture. $URL$ 

There is nothing special about that bike that necessitates any special rear rack. You'll want to make sure that the bottom bolt that attaches on the disc side is not so long that it pokes the disc but that's true with any frame. 

Leaving out the back story - which is emotional - here is how I got an alloy seatpost out of a Columbus SLX (steel) frame. I got a bunch of optimistic advice and it all failed me. I tried: Penetrating oil such as WD-40, Hard core penetrators like PBlaster and Kroil, Freeze spray, Hammers, and giant levers. I was down to the last resort - sodium hydroxide, aka lye, aka drain cleaner. 

No. Based on your question and your comments, there is not a product that does what you are seeking (get your hips over the bottom bracket). The reason being that no one rides that far forward.1 The old style Profile is probably your best bet for getting forward: 

Actual reply to actual question: I find it supremely comfortable. Not uncomfortable in the least. I absolutely endorse carrying your lock around your waist. In fact, my summer bag is an Ortlieb backpack with no ulock holder so I wear my ulock around my waist every day and never have an issue with comfort. I have a belt with a u-lock slot and a hip pouch on it. The hip pouch holds tools, a co2 cart, and a tube. The majority of my time this thing is in my bigger bag, which I carry on my back. However, if I want to run a quick errand I just grab the hip pouch. If I want to travel really light I leave the pouch and use the belt with my lock. If you get too hung up analyzing the hipster culture you will miss out on the practical analysis. Now, practically speaking, I would not put this attachment on the belt that is holding up my pants. But as a means to keep your lock on you, around the waist is the way to go. EDIT TO ADD for @David Richerby: I have a few bikes and I don't put u-lock holders on each of them. I carry my lock on my body. Some of the bikes have no place for a u lock to mount! 

Look into a style of bike called a townie, or town bike, or maybe even a cruiser. These bikes seat you almost upright with all your weight on your butt. If you don't find the style by name, you are basically looking for a bike with handlebars higher than the saddle. You might even say, the higher the better but you'll need to test-ride to be sure. The ghost shifting is a maintenance problem. But be aware that low quality components can be impossible to tune into accurate and consistent shifts. But be aware that none of this will keep you from crashing into walnuts or getting scared off your bike by barking dogs. EDIT: I meant to also include recumbent bikes, especially the ones with steering under the seat aka under seat steering aka USS. 

For bar-mounted headlights I use flashlights from Solar Force. The flashlights I use run on one 18650 battery. I am not going to lie, the website is confusing and once you figure out the website the individual parts you need to order are confusing and once you figure out which parts you need to order figuring out the options of the various parts is confusing. However, this is the place to get quality lights for cheap. I use the L2N body with the 3.7v XM-L T6 Cree bulb. (I also order extra switches and reflectors while I am at it but they are unnecessary. However you might want to test an orange peel reflector which diffuses the light; if you run two headlights one with orange peel and one with smooth provides flood and spot lights). 

Biking shorts could help but it's good to understand some things. First is that your coccyx shouldn't be touching the saddle or minimally if it does. A lot of people make the mistake of getting a cushy bike seat to alleviate such pain. The problem with squishy bike seats is that your sit bones sink down into the saddle and all the squishy stuff packs into your crack and starts pushing on stuff up there. Imagine a really hard seat - your sit bones contact the saddle and nothing squeezes up into the soft area. Of course, between the bones and this hypothetical hard saddle is tissue and skin which can get irritated and bruised. Which is why we have padded saddles. Appropriately padded saddles. So the first thing I'd suggest is trying a new saddle. Something firmer and made out of quality materials. Stock saddles can be pretty bad. The chamois in bike shorts is like a second pair of socks on a hike. It adds a layer of padding and friction relief in that bones/tissue/saddle interface. In short, bike shorts might help but the right saddle alone will enable you to comfortably complete an ~11 mile ride without butt bruises. Caveat - exceptions to all of this if you are anatomically abnormal in any way, I am particularly thinking of overweight. Caveat no. 2 - it takes time to get used to being back on the bike. Your butt is going to scream at you if you over-do it and cause some tissue bruising. And if you do that you aren't going to want to get back on the bike. So take it easy! And oh yeah - look at saddles with anatomical cut outs, those work really well for some people. And oh oh yeah. Some stores have a test program where they mail you like ten saddles and you ride all of them as you like in order to find one that fits. $URL$ WTB also has a ten-pack that they sell shops - shops that have that should rent you a saddle for a week for like 10 bucks. 

Or you can go smaller and shim it up with aluminum cans. EDIT: I removed the suggestion to get a 27.2 and remove .2 mm of material. 

You aren't going to be able to get those rivets out and replace the smallest chainring; it's not going to happen. Chainrings and the holes for the bolts are designed for tight tolerances and you'll never get it back together in a functional manner. Do I think you should try? Absolutely. 

It impacts your real world form, but it doesn't necessarily do bad things. The biggest change is going to be out-of-the-saddle riding. As was mentioned, there is a tendency to bounce up and down on a spin bike, and this naturally occurs when we leave the saddle by dropping our hips down and forward or move off the saddle with our chests vertical. Even in these positions you could stop the bouncing by focusing on spinning your feet while keeping your hips in place, but it's going to look goofy and you're going to waste yourself - like Tony Little on a Gazelle. The better spin bike posture is to raise your butt off the saddle and move your hips back not forward, and keep your back straight and flat (parallel to the ground). Now as you spin your feet you will have a better time immobilizing your hips in space because some of your weight is forward on your arms and you don't get wasted controlling the bounce. Also, to the extent that your hips are moving up and down, because your torso is not stacked on top of them, but rather leaning forward on a different plane, the up down movement is not transmitted to your upper body but stops at your hips. If you tried to use your hips to stop the motion while your torso was vertical your hips would be moving radically side to side like a salsa hula dancer. 

For blinkies I am using Blackburn Fleas. I picked these because they charge via USB (or solar!) and use the same charger so I can have one at home and one at work. The charger is proprietary otherwise this would not be an issue. I really like the Flea headlight because of the way I use it. I use velcro to quickly stick it to the top of my helmet, no straps to mess with. It is built in such a way that I am able to remove a bunch of plastic from the bottom (shave it off with a razor knife) to lower the profile. 

I wear the Halo Visorband. It basically looks like I'm wearing a cycling cap under my helmet but without the layer of fabric over the top of my head. I also use the Headsweat brand headbands which are effective. They make a few style, some thicker than others. I pull the pads of out my helmet (Giro Atmos) except for the one at the top of my skull. The thing is, if it's hot enough and the wind is at my back or I get stopped at a light I get sweat in my eyes and once it starts its hard to stop. I make sure I have something in my jersey pocket to wipe my eyes. If I use my bare fingers I make the problem worse! So for me it's one of the commercial sweatbands and either cotton or microfiber cloth accessible for when the burn takes over. Speaking of burn, keeping sunscreen and other products away from the area above the eyes helps. It's a trade off of course because this is where we need sunscreen but that stuff in the eyes can be deadly. And that's not hyperbole. 

It can be caused by a number of things. Something catastrophic can occur, like taking a corner on an under inflated tire and rolling the tire off the rim and sliding down the road on the side of the tire, or something small which then gets worse over time like a pinch flat or even a manufacturing defect. In the event of the small issue (before the tube bulges out) you can prevent the problem from worsening by sewing it up with dental floss (I prefer cinnamon). I've had this technique hold on some Gatorskins for a few months, but at >100 PSI it's only a matter of time before some tube starts to show and then bulge. The most popular solution is to use a boot. People like to use dollar bills as boots. Just lay the bill inside the tire between the tube and tire. When you inflate you should get no bulge. 

All things being equal, yes the bottom bracket spindle length is related to Q factor. I'd encourage you to rethink your problem. I've never heard of someone solving a knee problem by reducing the Q factor. Most want to reduce the Q angle which is accomplished by increasing the so-called factor. You should do a search for pedal axle extender as I believe this might lead you to the cheapest, fastest, least complex, and widest solution. 

Fenders don't fall into an "ok with racks" or "not ok with racks" category. Generally speaking, most traditional fender designs will work on bikes with racks attached. There may be certain combinations of fenders and racks that are problematic, but those are the exception. An example of a problem would be a bike whose rear rack is very close to the top of the rear wheel - it would be hard to fit a fender in there, but that's a specific problem which requires a specific solution. That said, when putting a lot of accessories on a bike, we should expect to be bending and cutting and filing as we go. We should not expect a front/rear set of fenders and racks to be a perfect fit on a frame out of the box unless each of those parts were specifically designed to be a fit with each other. 

I typed this whole answer and then decided to cut to the chase, which I doing here. IF you do not have a tiny splinter hidden in the tire I think you are pinching the tube between the tire and the rim during installation. This explains the flats at 50-60 lbs. Losing weight is not the problem. It might be part of the problem - that is to say that someone who weighs 90 lbs and rides your bike might not get flats - but there is something going on here. You are inspecting the inside of the tire, which is important. If you are thorough it eliminates one potential cause. However, I have had many holes caused by tiny slivers of metal which are embedded on the inside of the tire like a splinter. These slivers will not make a new tube go flat in the garage (in fact they cannot be felt with the fingers with the tire right-side-out); they only kick in once I am riding the bike. You might have something like this. I find them by turning the tire inside out and running my finger along it, pushing hard. You can see how this ends up - if I find the cause I get a splinter! Something might be puncturing your tire that is invisible during tire changes. One tip - you might do this already - when you install your tube align the valve stem with the printing on the tire. When you get a flat and remove the tire and tube you can find the hole then lay the tube on the tire to find the location on the tire of the hole in the tube.
