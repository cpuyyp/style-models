In this society, the citizens are given a bracelet-like device that is connected to the radial artery in their dominant hand. The device monitors their health, offers advice, etc and also serves as a tracking device. It is never taken off, it is a permanent part of that person, expanding and contracting as the person grows or shrinks. An important character in this story suffered a traumatic event during which his bracelet was removed/torn off. At first, I simply believed that this wouldn't have a big effect on his health aside from blood loss and that he'd be fine afterwards. But after a bit of research, I've realized that is unrealistic. What physical/mental effects would damage to the artery cause? Could he even survive this? If the removal were more 'gentle' and systematic instead of just being violently torn off, would the effects be significantly different? Edit to add more detail: Technology in this society is more advanced than our current modern technology (levitating transportation exists, cloning exists, etc). This character looses his bracelet at a young age (about 6-7 years) during a violent struggle with an adult male. The device is quite literally torn off, leaving a jagged gash up his forearm until it was torn free. The character is left like this for at least 10-20 minutes before he is found. 

I think that the broad categories of instruments would remain, as they are simply ways of making a pleasant noise. Strings, percussion and wind are likely to evolve whatever happens. Past that though, who knows what will happen? The drum is pretty likely to occur, but who knows what might turn up in the strings or wind sections? The more complex the instrument, the less likely it is to turn up in a parallel universe - so a recorder or flute is quite likely, a piano much less so. 

Shoot the dogs. As a bonus, this also helps to alleviate the food shortage. Another possibility would be to capture a dog or two, and assuming that they have roughly the same personality and instinct as other dogs, train them to protect me. If all else fails, then a pointed stick works as a pretty effective foil to almost any wild animal. Finally, to protect my house from dogs I would give it doors. 

As per the above answers, your best bet would be using their small size for stealth, and avoiding direct combat. However, if they do need to protect themselves against people in case something goes a bit wrong, then how about a miniaturised anti-tank weapon? You probably couldn't have much explosive in it (if your men are 1/17 scale, then that's about 1/5,000 by weight). But a payload of several grams is more than enough for Ricin poisoning or similar, and by using a guided rocket the weapon can be kept relatively small and lightweight. 

Assuming that in the 25th century you have the technology to reverse aging etc and otherwise return their physical bodies back to the state they were in when they left the past then you can give them years of extra life and wondrous living - just with the caveat that they won't be able to remember it later. If you pick them up not long before their historical death this is probably going to be quite an attractive offer. Add in that if they are spending enough time in the future they will get to see their artistic endeavors being enjoyed and appreciated and I think most artists will take you up on it. 

Claustrophobia, particularly the Cabin fever/stir crazy form - it's a an oldy-but-a-goody. Wiki describes the symptoms of being "stir crazy" as including "elevated and often increasing levels of anxiety, frustration, agitation, fidgeting, manic depressive type mood swings, and accessory episodes of acting out impulsively or otherwise antisocially on those feelings," combined with the description on the Cabin Fever article of "a distrust of anyone they are with" and that sounds like a recipe for a bit of good old fashioned homicide amongst "friends". Not everyone is affected by these things and if a member of the team were prone to such effects and it were missed during the pre-mission pysch screenings (maybe they even lied a little to get on the mission?) it could easily only affect one or two people sufficiently to cause them to go homicidal. 

The real question is why? Fortifications went out of fashion in the 20th Century because weapons development rendered them obsolete - however they are becoming notably prevalent in low-intensity conflicts. Walling will therefore really depend on the level of weaponry in your post-apocalyptic world - if equipment such as aircraft or heavy armour still exists then they won't really help, if you're just up against small-arms then there's much more utility in walling things in. It is also worth considering the alternatives to walling; mines in particular may be an effective way of keeping people out. 

Taking it back to the undiscovered tribes aspect, the first thing is to try and indicate non-aggression. Some parts of this will likely be universal - for example, it's very likely that being surrounded will imply more of a threat than staying back and sending an individual or small group forward to communicate. Other aspects will be more difficult and depend on knowledge of each others' weapons and capabilities - for example, all human civilisations will understand the principle of pointy sticks being weapons; hence a pointy stick or similar aimed at someone is an aggressive act, lowering it is less so, and grounding it could be seen as distinct sign of non-aggression. However, with more advanced weapons the equivalents may not be understood; for example slewing turrets towards an enemy would be well-understood by other people, but perhaps not by an alien race. 

None of these would provide enough manpower to replace slavery on its own but a combination quite possibly would. 

In the distant past the people of the religion had an Enemy, so naturally the people of this religion had to go and fight a holy war to eliminate the threat, however because of the inclement weather at the end of the year and the need to get people back to plant the crops at the start of the second month there was only really a "window" of the first month where it was ok to go off and fight this Enemy so the leaders (who ruled both the state and the church) mandated that everyone had to wait until the start of the first month to go and had to be back by the end of it. This was a hugely successful war and heralded the start of a bright new era of growth and prosperity for the people of the religion and as such is an extremely significant event. Over the years however the finer details of why they could only go fight the enemy during that first month gets a bit lost in translation - certainly the crops issue is not what it once was, however the notion that the first month was the only "acceptable" month to go and kill the enemies of the religion remained and as the "enemies" now can be taken to mean the criminals within their own society this gets translated into the first month of the year being the only acceptable month to kill them.
