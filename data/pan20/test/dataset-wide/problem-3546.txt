Like many simplistic calculations, the typical estimate for maximum heart rate is just that, an estimate. It will work well for some people and not for other people. If you have a heart that is smaller than average, you will likely have a higher maximum heart rate. This is why many exercise programs use a perceived exertion scale rather than a heart rate measurement. The question of whether you should work out at your maximum heart rate is a question for you to bring up with your physician and is not directly tied to what that maximum rate might be. As for the optimal heart rate to exercise, it depends totally on what your goals are and how much you have been training. If you are just getting into exercise, then exercising at a level where you are just starting to get out of breath is a good place to start. On the other hand, if you are an experienced athlete, doing maximal effort intervals may be part of your regular training. 

A little research shows that lactose-free milk is made by adding lactase to milk, which breaks down the lactose into simpler sugars. If the brand you are drinking is like that, it will have no difference on your nutrition. 

I think you are overthinking this. It's important that you be reasonably close at the pace at which you run, but a little variation up and down will not have a big impact on the effectiveness of the training. As far as speeding up and slowing down, don't worry too much about that either. I would aim to start up at the same speed that you can easily slow down; that preserves the overall duration of the interval. As for rest, active rest (moving at a reduced pace) is preferable to sitting down. Whether you walk or jog is up to you. The pace should be low enough that you recover to a low heart rate before the next interval. The point of interval training is that by doing short workouts, you can not wikipedia 

This is a huge and complex question. I can share a few thoughts. There is lots of data out there on eating healthily, and following most of it will put you on the right track. In general, avoiding processed foods and refined carbs is a good idea. You can - and, in fact, should - consider refined carbs during your workouts if they are fairly long. Also, look up "recovery nutrition", and follow that; how you recover has a huge impact. If you want a book, "food for fitness" by Carmichael, and "Feed zone cookbook" (I think that's the name) are good. Most calorie calculators aren't very good; there are too many variables and they don't do a very good job. If you have a lot of extra money, you can get a power meter and track things that way, but honestly, that's overkill. Instead, just eat sensibly and weigh yourself every few days. If you are gaining weight, you are eating more than you need; if you are losing weight, you are eating less than you need. If you do want to reduce weight, I'd aim for a pound per week max; if you lose more it will compromise your training. Finally, I would look to varying your workout so that it is faster on some days, slower on others. If you search for "cycling intervals", you should find some good stuff. Good luck. 

You require water during exercise mostly because you sweat and/or you did not start out in a hydrated state. You may have gotten more efficient at skating, which would mean that you would get less hot and sweat less. 

Sounds to me like you are doing what you should be doing. Seven years old is very young to start any structured training, and I would just let her do what she wants to do. 

The simple answer is that it is safe. Whether it is effective depends upon your goals. If you are starting from an untrained condition, then it pretty much doesn't matter what you do, and working out every day will work fine. Once you get somewhat trained, things change. If you are not well-recovered, you simply cannot work hard enough to stress your system, and without that hard work, you will not improve. To put it another way, it's the off days where you get better and rest enough to work hard on your on days. 

I also recommend an expert to look at it. I would probably start with a PT instead of a doctor, but either should work. Back muscles are weird. You can have cases where a muscle is persistently tight but not painful, and then some occurrence will trigger it to get painful. The fix will likely be some combination of massage, pressure-point therapy, ultrasound, stretching, and exercise. 

It's sometimes said: Improvement = training stress + recovery Your training puts a stress on your system, and during recovery you get stronger. Most training programs are built around generating different kinds of training stress in efficient ways and providing appropriate time to recover. Both the amount of training to create stress and what is needed for recovery depends on the athlete, their condition, the sport, and other factors. The answer to your specific question is, "it depends". It depends on what kind of training you did before, and it depends on what you mean by "exercising". If, for example, you did an all-out intervals workout on your bicycle. If you go out the next day and try to duplicate that effort, you are likely wasting your time; you haven't recovered enough to be able to impose more training stress on your system. If, on the other hand, you go out the next day and do a light ride, you will get your legs and body warmed up and you will likely recover faster than if you sat around. 

It depends on what you mean by "get fat". If you are talking strictly about weight, then the only way that you put on weight is with a calorie surplus. If you are talking about size, however, fat is much less dense than muscle, so it's possible to lose muscle and gain fat - and therefore size - even if you have a calorie deficit. 

Your fitness improves when you put training stress on your body and then give your body time to recover. You are doing the same workout over and over, and your body has gotten used to it, so it no longer produces any training stress, and you don't get better. So, what you need to do is provide focused times where you can work harder, thereby providing training stress and leading to improved results. This generally involves intervals. There are a lot of structured ways to do training on a bicycle involving heart rate monitors and power meters. If you want to try those, I recommend the programs by Friel or Carmichael. In particular, Carmichael has one that is design for those who don't have a lot of time to spend. If you want to be more casual about it, that's okay; you can still see results with more of a do-it-yourself approach. Basically, you need to split your workout into sections where you ride easy, and sections where you ride hard. You may also need to have some workouts where you ride easy the whole time; the high-intensity workouts only work if you are rested enough to work our really hard. I would suggest starting with something like 2 minute intervals. Find a consistent section, and then alternate between riding at a pace you can only maintain for 2 minutes, and then riding at a pace where your heart rate recovers (I aim to get down below 120) for 3 minutes. Repeat this 4 times, take 10 minutes off, and then repeat for another set of 4 intervals. This will definitely help. There are lots of other structured training approaches; you can do lactic threshold intervals, peak intervals, over/unders, etc. The key is to make sure you are rested enough to do them. 

Basically, you are drinking the equivalent of sugar water. Malto-dextrose is a glucose polymer, and because of that, it doesn't taste as sweet as sugar. It's great if you are an endurance athlete and want the carbs because of the reduced sweetness. It has a high glycemic index, so to your body, it's pretty much like you are just eating sucrose. I don't see the point of anybody taking in that much extra sugar. The point of a bulk is to make sure that you have an excess of nutrients. Most lifters take in extra protein, because that's what you need most to build muscle. If you want a good reference on bulking, try the reddit fitness forum. You will find a ton of useful information there. 

Assuming you have sufficient sodium, your body will do a good job regulating your water level; if you drink too much, you will excrete it. 

Part of the difference that you are noting is genetic; some people are naturally better at aerobic sports, and some are better at putting muscle on. In running for example, you don't see sprinters become marathoners, nor do you see marathoners become sprinters, no matter how hard they train. They don't have the genetics for it. For a given person, however, the answer to your question is that your body will optimize to keep muscles that are being used and eliminate muscle that is not being used. You see that in strength training regardless of whether you do aerobic training or not. Long-period aerobic exercise - such as long-distance running or cycling - is uniquely good at tearing down unused muscle. This is mostly because of the nutritional requirements of those sports; you are in the aerobic zone for a long time and burning lots of calories, and some of those will come from protein. Also, after the exercise is over, your body will want to rebuild carbohydrate stores and it may tear down muscle mass to get there. Good nutrition - especially recovery nutrition - will help with this, but as a long-cyclist who also lifts weights, it's hard to do both. You can, however, hit a balance, and if you don't do a ton of cardio, the effect isn't that big. I will note, however, that pure steady-state cardio isn't the most effective use of training time for most people; HIT training will give them both a larger cardio training effect and improve their anaerobic fitness as well. I'll also note that in long-distance running and cycling, lightness is an advantage; in running it's more efficient to have lighter legs, and in both you have less weight to carry up hills. 

I recommend rolling the bottoms of your feet with a tennis ball; that should help loosen things up nicely. 

How much you are losing depends upon your personal genetics and your training. Some people have sweat that is saltier that others. If you regularly train in hot weather and sweat a lot, your sweat will become less salty. The amount of sodium you can lose is significant; some people lose in excess of 1000mg of sodium per liter of sweat. How much you are taking in depends on what you are eating/drinking. If you eat restaurant or prepared food, you are likely getting a fair amount of salt in your diet, but if you are eating a better diet, you may not be getting a lot of salt. Since everybody is different, it's important to determine whether this is an issue for your and whether you need supplementation. You can do this by weighing yourself before and after your exercise; if your weight has gone up, you are hyponatremic. Another symptom is swollen hands and not needing to use the bathroom even through you have drunk a lot of water. If you spend a lot of time in the bathroom later after you have eaten something with salt in it later, that's another good indication. If you are not gaining weight and you are going to the bathroom, you probably aren't hyponatremic. The mechanism for this is interesting; your body loses some sodium when you excrete excess water. When your blood sodium gets low, your body tries to conserve that by slowing down the kidneys, and it stashes the excess water between cells, swelling up the body and making you heavier. If you need supplementation, there are a few option: Sport drinks. Most sport drinks don't really have a lot of sodium in them; Gatorade has about 440mg/liter and it's on the higher side. Electroyte drinks. A drink such as Nuun has about 320 mg per serving. Electrolyte tablets. These are the big guns in sodium replacement; Succeed S-Caps have about 320mg per capsule. Real food. I carry some salty real food; something like beef jerky has impressive amounts of salt in it. If it's a long & hot day, I will have one bottle with sport drink, one with nuun, and I'll also take a couple of electrolyte capsules per hour. I also carry beef jerky and salty crackers. 

You do work on a bicycle to overcome wind resistance and to lift you and the bike up hills. If you do a slow flat ride, you will burn fewer calories; if you do a fast hilly ride, you will burn more. Converting the two values you give to calories per hour would be 440-810 calories. I'm a fairly serious recreational cyclist; I ride a few thousand miles a year, and do specific training. I ride with a power meter, which directly measures how much work I do, which can be (fairly accurately) converted to calories burned. Riding all out I can put out around 800 calories/hour. You don't mention what sort of fitness state you are in or how hard you were riding. If you are a highly-trained athlete and you've been riding for a while, 600 cal/hour might be reasonable. If you aren't very trained and you weren't riding for a while, 300 cal/hour may be a better estimate. 

Well, it's pretty simple. Pretty much any training that you do that improves your aerobic capacity will increase your fat-burning potential. Interval training is a traditional - and successful - way of doing this. If you increase your aerobic capacity, you can generate more power from fat and will therefore need to use less carbohydrate for a given power level. However, most cyclists just use this increase to ride faster, so it's a bit of a wash. If you watch pro racers - who have epic ability to burn fat - you'll notice they are sucking down the carbs pretty much all the time. Two other answers mention bonk training. The research around the effect of riding with low glycogen stores isn't very clear - some studies say it helps, other say no. If you do want to do it, there is no requirement, however, that you go all the way to the bonk. 

You are likely hyper-extending your back. The best thing to do is to find a PT to work with you, but if you want to do it yourself, here is what I suggest: 

I'm a long-distance cyclist and I lift now and then. I have a few thoughts... First, I suspect your cadence is far too low. If you are used to squatting you are used to pushing a ton of force into your legs. If you push a big (ie "high") gear, you are going to wear your legs out really quickly. You can get a cheap computer for your bike or you can just count revolutions of your legs, but a decent spot to aim is 80-90 RPM. Second, I think you are cycling too much. If you are pushing hard almost every day, you aren't giving your body any time to recover and improve. If you are also lifting, I wouldn't be surprised if your legs are rebelling. Finally, there are cycling muscles and there are weightlifting muscles. Lifting is training your legs to do a small number of reps at a very high force, while if a cyclist does a 5-hour ride, it's doing (5 * 60 * 90 = ) 27,000 reps at much lower forces. If I've been working hard on squats or deadlift, I find that it really makes my legs feel dead on the bike.
