From this perspective, the answer is obvious - you need to do better task tracking and management. This won't involve a change to your process/queue/prioritization - just a little extra work in time tracking of each task. 

It depends on the portion of the technical interview. If you're asking questions they should simply know without fault, I might just move on, and if it's a particularly important failure I might revisit it later from a different angle to make sure it wasn't a simple mistake. During the technical portion meant to discover how they work through a problem, how they collaborate, what questions they ask, etc I'll provide them with feedback of varying kinds. I might simply correct them outright, "That's wrong," with no further information to see how the respond, giving them a chance to either fix their error or convince me otherwise. I might ask, "Are you sure?" and see if they can revisit the model they've built in their head, the information they've been given, and find the error themselves. It's worthwhile sometimes correcting them as well to see how quickly they pick up on the error when given the correct information. I prefer to treat them as I would treat a co-worker, primarily gauging how they interact with people particularly when there are conflicts between what they believe is correct and what someone else says is correct. Are they simply a "yes man", do they respond well to criticism, are they able to stop in the middle of an explanation, discuss a tangent, and get right back on topic, do they resolve conflicts with care and compassion, do they have a deep enough understanding to be able to discuss foundational principles and support higher level concepts, etc. This provides significantly more information than a solely technical interview. 

Usually the conversation goes something like this: Client: "So we need you to build project X for us as part of the interview process." Me: "Ok. That will take me a few days to get the initial prototype online for you to review. I'll give you the URL for the demo, and a file or two showing the code style." At this point the discussion goes in one of two directions. The more likely direction happens when I'm dealing with a good business: Client: "Great, let me know if you have any questions." The less likely direction, though, happens when I'm interviewing with a bad or shady client: Client: "Um, we need to have the whole source code, not just a sample." By this time I've already sunk a lot of time in interviewing, and am probably unhappy that I didn't weed out this bad client earlier. Generally I don't give them any slack, because I don't want to work with people like this. If they understand that we're trying to build a business relationship, then they won't try to get work from me for free, and they will understand that both sides will protect themselves with reasonable measures. Me: "I see. Unfortunately I don't do speculative work, where I would have to deliver the entire solution without assurance of payment. I've already provided you with my portfolio, and I'm even willing to build a site for you that demonstrates my ability to work to your specifications. If that isn't enough to convince you that I'm the resource you need, it's probably best if we discontinue the interviews so we can both spend our time finding a better match for each of our respective needs." They may then give all sorts of reasons why they have to have the full site, but it's never been worth my time pursuing such a contract. There are too many better opportunities in this world to pursue the bad ones. 

I wouldn't assume anything. If they don't doubt your technical skills, they'll probably continue to shop you around. Call or email them and ask them 1) if they have any other positions that might fit your skills, and 2) what skills employers are looking for in this area that are close but don't exactly fit your resume. This will show them you're interested, you're able to adapt, and the simple act of following up will demonstrate you're motivated, suggesting that you'll work to improve how you present yourself. 

You are not asking for something directly related to your position and within the realm of your responsibilities. While you personally might derive great benefit to knowing, there is no benefit to the company for you to know. Therefore this is something that you want to know, but do not need to know. If you ask at all, and I suggest you carefully consider whether it's worth besmirching your reputation with "nosy" or worse, then you must acknowledge that you don't need to know, and ask it as a favor without any expectation that you will be answered. Further, you should recognize that it might involve company trade secrets, IP, and information that you, as a temporary worker (in this case, intern) might not be allowed to have or know. As such you shouldn't ask other employees, but your direct supervisor - they will know whether you are permitted this information, or who to ask if they don't know. If, after all this, you still desire to pursue this inquiry, you might ask it face to face with something along these lines: 

Take deep breaths. Try to focus on what's going on. Pinch yourself surreptitiously, bite your tongue, dig your nails into your palms, or do something to get your body to be attentive without alerting the interviewer that you're having a hard time controlling your body. If you have to yawn, make it as small and short as possible, cover your mouth, don't stretch, and while you should look away from the interviewer, don't point your head towards the ceiling or use any more movement than necessary to regain control after the yawn. Apologize without explanation and move on, "Sorry. So your questions was..." 

So does it harm you or the business? If you have clients, customers, or investors coming through then yes, it's clearly a business issue. If you've heard or seen negative reactions from your female co-workers that suggest this is affecting them, their work, or making their work environment worse, then it's a business issue. You probably aren't in a good position, otherwise, to determine objectively if the displayed images are truly denigrating. You have an opinion on the matter, certainly, but it may be that everyone else in your office has a different opinion where this isn't a problem. So I don't think you can generalize - in the absence of walk-throughs of the office area for other business professionals outside the company, you may not have much objective reason to suggest that he shouldn't have those images on his screen. There is one possible resource, though - does the company have a dress code? It's reasonable to suggest that any displayed images within the office environment roughly meet the company guidelines for the same reason they apply to oneself. If one of your co-workers chose to come into the office and work in their underwear and it violates office policy, it's reasonable to suggest that similar images should violate office policy. Beyond that, if you aren't personally affected, and you don't have a good basis or foundation to suggest they change their wallpaper, then you should probably ignore it. Assuming you've decided to pursue this, and see it as important to the business or yourself, then how you approach it depends on the foundation for your claim. In general, first approach the co-worker. Tell them what you've observed, and why you believe it's inappropriate. Indicate that if they disagree, then you'd like to go with them to an appropriate authority within the company to help discern the best choice for the company. The most important thing is to avoid a sense of judgement. It's not that the activity/images/interest are wrong, but that the time and place require a high standard for whatever reason you've founded your claim upon. Make it about the images, time, and place, and not about them or their preferences. Being able to be objective and using company or industry manuals or stated standards is important here. If it's just a personal distaste and distraction, mention it to them, again without judgement. Use "This makes me feel..." and "I am uncomfortable..." statements which reflect your feelings, rather than "That content is ..." statements which subjectively judge the content. 

Recognize that you are likely not alone in this feeling. Whether you are from a rural area with conservative values, or from a beachside town with bare skin everywhere, you might still feel uncomfortable with aspects of others' dress and style in the context of your work environment. Rather than chalking it up to personal taste and ignoring your own feelings, or allowing others to dissuade you from voicing your feelings and discomfort, it's healthy and worthwhile to explore these things openly. You may be surprised to find that others - even those who you feel are dressing inappropriately - agree with you and would prefer a more professional environment. Having an unrestricted environment may lead to lower morale and higher stress, lowering productivity for workers. It's in your company's best interest to provide an environment free of distractions, but they can only do that if they know about the distractions. How you approach encouraging a company to adopt a dress code policy, or strengthen an existing policy, however, is a much more complex question. Feel free to ask it if you want to explore that option. Find a better working environment Lastly, it might be easier for you to simply find a job that is more compatible with your needs. You're spending a significant amount of your lifetime at your job. There are many, many companies that have professional business attire standards, and while you're limiting your options by making that a requirement in your job search, the positions exist. Keep this job while you look, take your time, and you will eventually find a position that better matches your need, and provides fewer onsite distractions, allowing you to work more comfortably and productively. 

"Thanks for the notice, I didn't realize the priority of this project had changed again and was more important than the work I'm currently doing. Let's walk over to [boss's] office and discuss prioritization so I'm on the same page as everyone else." 

It should be a very quick visit, and allows you to bring up the issue without casting blame. It's entirely possible you've input a wrong number somewhere, or the calculation he gave you isn't perfect (maybe misplaced parenthesis, etc - errors of transcription). Regardless of the source of the error, simply bringing it up as a question about why you're getting a different number shouldn't be offensive or problematic, and will give him an opportunity to fix the problem - or correct you - depending on what actually happened. 

No. Your business with them is finished, and if you don't want to annoy your recruiter don't attempt further contact with the company. Remember, your recruiter may still be trying to fill this job and get the recruitment fee - so they still need to maintain a good relationship with this HR. 

The company is now taking 7.5 additional hours of life away per week from each employee - essentially forcing them to work a six day work week. That's 360 hours per employee, per year, assuming the 45 minutes is each way. That's equivalent to 45 eight hour work days - over two months per year. No wonder they're complaining, and no wonder they're all searching for new jobs. I doubt you even give them a fraction of that much time for vacation each year, but now you're simply taking it, not paying them for it, and ignoring their concerns. To offer no recompense is certainly unethical, if not illegal. Yes, your company's current policy may not permit reimbursement or payment, but this is exactly the sort of situation that demands the company either modify its policy, or stop accepting jobs which put employees in such a terrible position. It's unreasonable, and the policy must be changed or what you fear will happen will happen. Make it clear to the company that they must change the policy or they will lose the client because the workers are going to quit. No one wants to spend that much time daily on their drive, and if the client is important then they should pay the employees accordingly, acknowledging the bad situation you've put them in. Ideally you'd set up a ride sharing where their day starts at your office, they ride together in a van, ride sharing program, or similar paid for by the company, and then they arrive back at the office 8 hours later so their workday is actually 8 hours. Yes, the client gets less time in that scenario, but right now you're taking time from the employees without paying them so your client gets a full 8 hours, and you get paid for that. How is that not stealing from your employees? If it's not worth it for the company to reimburse them for those lost 5 weeks of time, then the client isn't worth it. 

"I appreciate your interest in this! We've worked very hard on our workflow, and while we're pretty happy with the results we are always looking for ways to improve. Can I spend an hour with you tomorrow to present the workflow, the results, and get more specific feedback?" 

You might want to first check out whether they understood the requirements, and whether the requirements are strong enough to show where the work performed doesn't meet them. If you find that they didn't meet the requirements, the solution is simple, "This is a great start, it looks like you only have a little more to do to meet requirement X." If you find that they didn't understand the requirements, the solution is pretty much the same, "It appears that it doesn't meet requirement X. Can you help me understand what you believe requirement X is about?" Then help them understand the real requirement after listening to them. If you find that the requirements aren't objectively measurable, and there's a wide gray line as to what might be interpreted as "done" then first attempt to narrow that line so it's more obvious, and measurable. If the task is subjective in nature, then decide who is the judge, and have that person give specific feedback and direction in an iterative fashion until they believe the work fits the requirements. Saying, "This needs improvement" or "I don't think this is your best work" isn't nearly as useful as showing them the goal, and helping them understand themselves the gap between what they've accomplished and the goal.
