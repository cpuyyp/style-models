Assume this is your standard superhero setting. Basically like the modern world, but with lots of superpowered threats and mad scientists, that are prevented from causing total anarchy by their benevolent counterparts. There is plenty of hypertech used by individuals, but somehow events usually conspire to keep it from getting into more than mad scientists and superhuman hands (with the premise of this question being something of an exception). 

The nanobots can place in additional files, but unless the person person created it with the ai already they can't alter existing ones(though they can add footage to a video even if they can't change existing stuff). *Storage mediums must be somewhat orderly and fixed to work so you can create files on a computer, or even create grooves on vinyl, however biological memory (possibly with the exception of say nematode worms) is too complex is disorderly to be affected so no memory implanting. 

In this scenario a piece of alien technology crashes on earth spilling nanomachines which permeate the earth, becoming ubiquitous. These nanobots can interface with digital technology and people's brains, and their only real application is that they can be used to create perfect cgi. Though I expect many answers to this question will be generalizable to many scenarios. 

A race of people was created through magic, their mind was greatly altered, among the abilities that were granted was a memory that perfectly records all sensory information forever. As well as the ability to run programs in a sort of secondary mechanical mind, that operates on a much faster magical substrate. This allows them to do things like instantly look at something like a QR code and know what's encoded (provided they have the mental program that reads QR codes). Setting is roughly your standard D&D esque fantasy (with this group's abilities making them nearly the only people capable of being general mages) but with some basic mechanical innovation like typewritters and the printing press. The world runs on magic, which makes most technology impossible, chemistry just doesn't work and the world resembles the ways people thought the world worked pre enlightenment. For these people there is no reason not to have a language as complex as possible when communicating with others sharing their abilities. They will all share the same same language since they can learn it in hours or days and tend to greatly value efficiency. So with that in mind what would you would expect from their language: I'm looking for the rough analogs for their spoken and written languages. The only limit to the sounds they can distinguish are the physical features of their ears, so you could pack in some massive bandwidth here. It's also important to note that their mental programs can produce sounds automatically, so no sound is more unpleasant to produce than any other, the only limits are what sounds they can physically produce. I also think they'd want to put in some physical motions here, this wouldn't just have to be stuff like sign language they could assign meaning to slight twitches in facial muscles or blinks. As for their analog of written language, it's important to mention that this race almost universally has slight hand tremors, so that would make drawing fine detail quite hard (so hand drawn QR codes are right out). The only fundamental limit to how quickly they can read is how quickly they can move their eyes. This language doesn't have to be done with a pen, what I'm looking for here is something they can put on paper or something similar quickly. If your solution involves a very simple cheap machine or say the use of a knife to get straight lines that's fine. You might also have another type of writting that would be used for books, where the difficulty of transcribing by hand wouldn't be a factor. Reminder: There's no reason to have this language resemble any language ever previously devised, in fact it seems really unlikely it would. Given how easy learning a language is for these people, there's no reason they wouldn't adopt whatever written and spoken systems were invented by linguists to maximize information bandwidth. Given the much higher bandwidth of this language it really ought to be basically indecipherable to vanilla humans, if they can understand it after all then it must be relatively simple, which there's no reason this language would be. 

While nearly everyone would die I have upon thinking about it resolved how I suspect most people would die and how some might live: How most people die: While I originally suspected people would die of asphyxiation, I don't think that's how most people outside crowded cities would die. Instead I think that people would move to avoid having their bubble run out of oxygen. However most of the easily accessible food is likely stored in areas like super markets that would run out of oxygen incredibly quickly. Once places a lot of people would go to like supermarkets run out of air, then going there would require a oxygen tank or carbon scrubber. Larger bubbles: One implication of the rules I established regarding the time fields may make survival possible for a small number, skin grafts. While the procedure would require medical expertise grafting skin from say your abdomen into living strips connected to your blood supply could enlarge your bubble substantially if the strip trailed off your body. Large permanent time fields: Due to the fact people wouldn't want to stand next to a generator they need to run, or stand in the middle of a super-efficient algae farm, and of course stand at intervals along the power-line from the generator to indoor farm. People would get time fields another way, animals: By taking animals intelligent enough to generate time field and grafting long strips of their own living skin onto the front and back of the animal, you can get large time field that are necessary to run well anything. Long term: While there may be many things I'm failing to take into account, I think it may be possible for groups of people to survive. Utilizing power plants and indoor farms with pigs with a long strip of their own living skin trailing as far as possible (maybe 20-100 ft?) in both direction generating the necessary time fields. In the long term large problems might be genetic diversity (though you might be able to easily make your way to perfectly preserved sperm banks), and obtaining resources, since any large scale operation would require nearby power plants to run co2 scrubbers (and lot of animals with skin grafts to generate time fields). Government: While individual governments would vary I can predict with some confidence what they would find valuable: Unlike many other post-apocalyptic scenarios canned food would be no more useful than normal food since shelf life isn't very meaningful though any food or water is useful. Gas and other fuels are useful for generators. Medical expertise is incredibly valuable for normal reasons but mostly because skin grafts are incredibly necessary. Co2 scrubbers are valuable for obvious reasons but any oxygen tanks are also quite valuable so you can scavenge for food in de-oxenagated areas. Helium and other buoyant gasses might also be valuable for several reasons: One when outside you can attach your long skin graft to a balloon to extend your bubble size. You could also attach a light weight animal able to generate a time field (with skin grafts to maximize bubble size) to a balloon which you hold onto with a rope and move up and down to mix fresh air from just above where any bubbles have been with your time field. While air on the ground in many places would be depleted there is a huge amount of air above where most people can reach that will still be fresh. EDIT, Nomads: While some people might try to survive in permanent settlements, probably more people would survive as nomads. Nomadic people would probably become very good at navigating while being limited to not seeing outside their bubble nomads would probably also use torches to see inside their bubble since plant material would be easiest to get. Nomads would use any form of ranged weapon since any wildlife you encounter unable to make its own time field can't escape you. Temporary settlements: nomads might use trained magpies attached to ropes letting them fly up vertically then come back down mingling the air of the birds fresh bubble with the old stale air. Nomads would also stick together for fear of getting separated. 

It's a staple in superhero stories with hypertech, for people to have some sort of serious inertia dampening technology. Either explicitly, or as a logical necessity. For instance having an iron man suit, or some other practically indestructible armor, won't prevent you from being totally liquified by missiles or just getting smashed against a barrier at massive speed, but of course that's often not what we see. So the question arises, assuming some sort of phlebotom based technology arises, that can encase a container and totally protect anything inside against arbitrarily high acceleration and deceleration forces (though the container itself is provided no special protection). How would such a technology affect the world, and what would its applications be? 

The AI can encode the information is any desired way so long as you have some idea of what you're doing. For the purposes of this, telling the ai (mentally commanding it)to create a video file on a computer that is indistinguishable from a video file the computer recorded itself will work, however this won't allow you to crack encryption or anything since you have no idea how the ai does it. Created video(/audio/digital analog for any sense) are really only limited by the creators imagination, as thus plenty of digital recordings are still fairly safe. So for instance the blind and deaf have pretty big limitations in what they can create using this. 

So I was watching this: $URL$ About just how much of politics is just about maintaining power. Which made me begin to wonder, how would governments work if the leaders didn't have to worry about having approval, ruling solely through their individual might? Let's imagine a scenario with dragons; dragons are extremely rare compared to humans, potentially immortal (though they are bound to get taken out after enough millennia) and can't cooperate except with their mate. They can't be poisoned, or otherwise killed through any means other than by another tougher dragon. They dislike subterfuge and given that they will only work with their mate, basically the only important factor in who wins a war is which mate pair is stronger. They also extremely dislike other dragons generally, so no political structure is possible except one with 2 dragons at the top (or one if a smaller kingdom not worried about attracting other dragons notice) Effectively the only thing that matters in this system is individual might So with that in mind how does the government work? Dragons really like having as much power as possible plus they will take all the gems and precious metals for themselves issuing fiat currency (or gold backed currency you can't legally trade for gold), or currency made of valuable material that isn't appealing to dragons. As thus dragons are incentivized to make the nation economically prosperous to build their hoard and it's not much of an empire if it's in anarchy so they do want their kingdom to thrive. They may take part in non-dragon warfare, but only occasionally in important battles. They can easily melt a castle or torch thousands of soldiers. Dragons can shapeshift, taking human forms that are still as durable, so as to lie low and watch the humans discretely. In addition: A third of dragons are pretty indifferent and won't be likely to take any part in all but the most important decisions, a third actually care about human welfare to some extent and another third are tyrants who demand worship, eat princesses the whole villainous shebang. This distribution is independent of power level. You should expect dragons to get more wise and powerful with age, so the most powerful kingdoms ought to have better leadership than most. Dragons attitudes to their underlings: All dragons will try to monitor their kingdom to some extent to ensure it's doing well and that they are properly respected and that nobody else is failing to act sufficiently humble. Indifferent dragons only start interfering if the kingdom starts to have major problems/people act uppity. Those underlings with the most power are those that seem to get results. Friendlies like to spend lots of time in human forms, of course they always pose as important people since dragons can't tolerate anyone treating them as an equal or subordinate; they hate blatant suck ups however and will try to put people with impressive qualities in charge. They may even flirt with letting the government be semi democratic when it comes to things they don't strongly care about. Tyrants will go publically in dragon form to be worshipped and are prone to randomly rampaging to eat people when it suits them. They are incredibly self absorbed and demand their whole kingdom glorify them. They can be easily manipulated by sycophants though their ability to see through flattery increases with age. Those in power will be those good at flattery and killing off opposition; the dragon likes picking people who seem powerful since having them suck up inflates their ego more. They are likely to never take human form as they find it insulting. They get more competent with age, or at least they stop repeating the dumb mistakes they've made in the past. To some extent this question can somewhat apply to any situation where there are extremely powerful entities that don't work together, love power and are only in danger from each other.
