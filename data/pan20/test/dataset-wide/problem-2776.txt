This is not an answer about source materials. This is a response to the question itself. Yes, philosophers do have a duty to question their government. As do auto mechanics, teachers, plumbers, and software engineers. Every citizen needs to question their government; and if the government starts to stray from the good; then the people need to speak out. Surely we who remember the twentieth century have seen what happens when the people shirk their responsibility. “It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority.” -- Benjamin Franklin $URL$ Do philosophers have a special duty, or any particular duty by virtue of being philosophers? No. Why should they? Philosophy is a profession like any other. Is a philosopher presumed to be wiser than others? Not in contemporary society by any means. A professor of philosophy writes books and studies other philosophers and can tell you what each one said. So if you ask a philosopher, "Should I put my suffering loved one out of their misery?" a philosopher can say, "Well, Aristotle said this and Russell said that." But they can't tell you what to do. They are not wise men. Just learned ones. I see no connection between that occupation and any special rights or obligations in society. We license doctors and we license plumbers. But we do not license philosophers. [Of course we do license professors of philosophy. But that is not the same thing.] Every single person in society has an obligation to question his or her government; and to speak out as needed, according to their own conscience. Everyone has a conscience, not just those who can quote Aristotle. What makes anyone think philosophers are special? And who thinks that, besides the philosophers? 

In normal math (above the level of set theory) it's standard procedure to define an object, and then show that at least one such object exists. For example, we define a Group as a set with a binary operation satisfying such-and-so. Then the very next thing we do is to give some examples of groups: the integers under addition, the nonzero reals under multiplication, the symmetries of a bed. The maids at the Hilbert Hotel are familiar with that one. That's the entire purpose, for example, of the Dedekind cut construction of the real numbers. Nobody ever uses it. You see it once and you forget about it. Why is it important? It's important because if we define the real numbers as an Archimedean complete ordered field, you can do all of real analysis with those axioms. They're all you need. But you could build all of real analysis out of those axioms, and you wouldn't know if there is any such set. So just once, you go back to basics and show how, given the axioms of set theory, you can construct a set having those properties. Once you do that, you can then just use the real number axioms. You never again care about the existence proof. But it is essential to supply an existence proof along with a definition. I could define a purpleunicoren as a unicorn that's purple. I could describe the biology of a purpleunicorn, and write books on breeding purpleunicorns. But it would all be vacuous. There is no object that fits the definition. Existence proofs are mandatory. 

It's often said that "if you don't vote, you can't complain." I hold the opposite. If you voted, you ratified the system. And since it's the system that's fundamentally broken; the various parties being akin to the blue-suited guards and the red-suited guards at the prison camp; then I say: If you voted ... you can't complain. You got exactly what you voted for. 

If B is false, A has to be false. Are you thinking of A -> B where A is false, therefore the implication is true? This is called material implication. $URL$ 

Yes, but only because every possible sequence of flips is a miracle. Consider. Suppose I flip a fair coin 10 times in a row. Say I get HTTHTTHTHT. Now that seems pretty normal, nothing remarkable about it. But the odds of that exact sequence of flips are 1/1024. To see this, what are the odds the first flip is H? 1/2, right? What are the odds the second flip is T? 1/2. And the odds that the third flip is T? It's 1/2. Continuing like this, we see that the odds of getting the sequence HTTHTTHTHT are 1/1024. The odds of getting any particular sequence of ten flips are 1/1024. If you happen to get HHHHHHHHHH you'd say, "Wow, an amazing coincidence!" But if you got HTTHTTHTHT you'd say, "Well that was boring, nothing special about that." But it is special. It's just as special as all heads. Do the same analysis for 1 million coin flips and you see that any particular sequence has exactly the same probability, namely 1/2 to the millionth power. Getting all heads or all tails or some completely random-looking string have exactly the same probability. The reason random-looking strings happen more often is because there are so many of them! But any particular one has the same tiny probability and is a miracle. In other words you are comparing the one outcome HHHHHHHHHH to the entire huge collection of all the outcomes involving mixed heads and tails. Of course the mixed strings are more likely, but only because there are so many of them. But flipping coins is nothing. The universe explodes into existence. Matter coalesces into the Milky Way galaxy, the sun and the planets. Life evolves on earth. Humans appear. Several hundred thousand years go by. A sperm fertilizes an egg. And here you are. Now that's a miracle. You personally are a statistical miracle. Your existence is unimaginably unlikely yet here you are. One needn't adopt a theological point of view to see that everything in the world is truly a miracle. Also see Can there only be one success in an infinite amount of trials? 

We do NOT define vacuous statements as true. A vacuously true statement is vacuously true. A "vacuously false" statement is vacuously false; although nobody ever gives this type of statement any thought. Example: Every element of the empty set is a purple flying elephant. We agree that this statement is (i) vacuous; it doesn't really say anything meaningful; and (ii) true by the laws of predicate logic. To find it false we must find an element of the empty set that is not a purple flying elephant. Since we can't do that, the statement must be true. Equivalently, "IF x is in the empty set, THEN x is a purple flying elephant." That is true by virtue of the definition of material implication. [Note that every other possible truth value assignment for implication is worse. People who complain about material implication rarely take that into account]. Now since we have cooked up a fine example of a vacuous truth, let's see if we can think of an example of a vacuous falsehood. How about: It is NOT the case that every element of the empty set is a purple flying elephant. Since the original statement is true, its negation is False. It still doesn't mean anything, it's vacuous. But it is FALSE. To prove otherwise you'd have to demonstrate an element of the empty set that is something OTHER than a purple flying elephant. But you can't do that! So this is a vacuous falsehood. Conclusion: A statement may be vacuous, meaning that it uses a quirk of logic to assert something that makes no real sense, yet it has a perfeclty deterministic truth value. [I'm sure someone can improve on that definition. I'm not sure if there even is a formal definition of "vacuous."] But given a vacuous statement, it may be true or it may be false. The reason "vacuous statements" are almost always truths, is simply that we talk about them as a corner case; while never bothering to mention their close relative, the vacuous falsehood. So this is a paradox of usage. Or perhaps we can call it a convention that leads people to think it's a rule, when in fact it's not. When we say "vacuous" we are almost always referring to some vacuous truth. But it's not logically necessary. It's just a linguistic convention. In any formal setting, if someone referred to a vacuous statement, you would be justified in asking them whether they mean it's vacuously true or vacuously false.
