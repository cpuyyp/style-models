When I wrenched for a cross team we just taped over the housing. We also would position the levers further out (unless you're running narrow bars.) Keep in mind there's no need to pull the tape so tight that it would bend the cable housing. You want to pull the tape just snug enough so it doesn't slip. If you get to the end of the bar and let go of the tape it shouldn't unravel. If it does you likely pulled it too tight. Also no need to use so much electrical tape at the end. If you want a really clean look cut end of the tape at a 45 degree angle so it lies flat when you finish wrapping and hold it in place with a dot of superglue. 

Generally speaking, the deeper the rim the more noise the wheel makes. A pronounced whooshing noise isn't unusual among deep dish wheels and disc wheels (as in the solid wheels, not the brakes) are even noisier. I had Cinelli and Hed discs when I raced and used to love the sound of them (the ride, not so much!) I would personally be very nervous of the no brand Chinese carbon wheels, frames and parts being sold on eBay. I've been hearing some absolute horror stories from shops and race mechanics. 

Loosen that top bolt however many turns you think you tightened it and maybe a few extra. Also loosen the bolt (or two) at the back of the stem. Set the bike on the ground, stand next to it and turn the handlebars 90 degrees. Now squeeze and hold the front brake. Don't let go. Try to roll the bike back and forth. You should feel a slight knocking sensation. This is play in the bearings (bad!) Tighten the top bolt a half turn. Repeat steps 2 & 3. Repeat step 4 until the knocking sensation is gone. Key here is to adjust the top bolt in very small increments until the play/knocking is just removed. Any tighter and you'll create binding which will prematurely wear out the bearings. Tighten the bolt or bolts at the rear of the stem. 

3mm is definitely not enough, especially with plastic fenders! A good rule of them is your fenders should be at least 10mm wider than your tires. I run 42mm tires on one bike and it has 58mm fenders. On my other bike I run 32mm tires and 45mm fenders. You also want at least 12mm between the inside of the fender and the tire. Ideally, you should have 20mm between the tire and point on the frame the fender bolts to (to account for fender thickness, protruding bolt heads and mounting hardware). Keep in mind poorly fitted fenders can be a safety issue. If an object gets kicked up into the fender it can cause a crash. Some good articles on fenders: $URL$ (Jan probably knows more about fenders than anyone in the cycling biz!) 

No. If nothing else you'd need to strip the frame to have it repainted after the guides are brazed into place. 

If it's an older bike then a pair of center pulls would be quite appropriate. Weinmann made some long reach center pulls in the past that could be picked up on eBay for not much. I think the model 890 and 999 had the longest reach but I can't remember exactly how long it was. Dia Compe still offer a long reach center pull though I'm not sure they reach quite that long. 95mm is quite a stretch, expect to have a lot of brake flex. 

Very generally speaking, the number of cogs on the cassette needs to match the number of clicks in the shifter. If your shifter clicks through 9 gears then you need a 9 speed cassette. If it has 8 clicks as yours does then you need an 8 speed cassette. If you want to switch to 10 speeds then at a bare minimum you'd need new 10 speed shifters and quite likely a rear derailleur. The shifters and derailleurs should be from the same brand. You would also need a 10 speed chain though the brand on this doesn't really matter. This starts to get pretty expensive, pretty fast. 

I've glued hundreds of tubulars and learned the craft from some of the best mechanics in the sport including a former wrench with the Motorola team and a former Mavic Service Course mechanic. These days tubulars are really only used in cyclocross, track and at the very top level of the sport. There are some very distinct downsides: 

Now, all that said if you're going to move forward I strongly suggest using mastik instead of tape. Tape isn't that much less messy and the bond seems to be less consistent then a good gluing job. Park Tool has as good a guide as any on mounting tubulars as anyone: $URL$ A few other tips: 

Check out the IRD Defiant wide range double crankset $URL$ It has a 94bcd which allows it to run 46x30 rings. Combine that with a 12-27 cassette or freewheel and you'll have plenty of range. Going to a triple presents a few problems: 

Safety. Improperly glued tubulars can roll off in a corner. This is not to be taken lightly. Even top pros have rolled tubulars (Joseba Beloki famously went down hard in the 2003 Tour de France, effectively ending his career) On a long descent dragging your brakes can heat up the rim enough to soften the glue resulting in a rolled tire. Expense. A decent tubular costs significantly more than a good clincher. Repair. You can't patch a tubular during a ride. You pretty much have to replace the entire tire. This means you need to carry at least one spare tire per ride (and hope you don't get more than one flat!) This BTW pretty much negates any weight savings which are trivial to begin with. Hassle. Mounting tubulars is a multi-day process, especially if you're mounting them on bare rims for the first time. Getting the tire onto the rim is significantly more difficult than mounting even the toughest clincher. 

I originally titled this question as "I'm looking for a convenient absolutely fail-safe automatic lock that works all the time". But, judging by some rather cold responses, that title seems to be quite an oxymoron for city dwellers. Please don't get hung up on the way the question is worded, but rather focus on the problem and on finding solutions. Please use some imagination. Try to think of alternatives that will help to solve the problem. Two bicycles have now been stolen from me within the last year. Both were mountain bikes. The second was full suspension. I am interested in getting into touring as well. So I'm thinking of 27-speed for my next bike. I also like the full-suspension mountain-bike idea. But before I get another bike I would like to be absolutely sure it cannot be stolen. Of course, that does not mean I will be entirely and certainly successful in meeting that objective. But I live in a small town and am also interested in rural, remote, solitary touring in rural areas distant from metropolitan areas. So professional bike thievery is not a major problem here. There simply are not enough bikes around to make professional bike thievery worthwhile. The problem is more about opportunistic crime and the difficulty of always remembering to lock my bike. It would be ideal if a bike could lock securely and automatically when it is dismounted. Simple motions to lock bike may be easier to remember and undertake rather than always trying to go through a bothersome rigmarole to lock a bike. In this regard, I saw a question dealing with having to lock a bike many times a day and the need to make locking a simpler operation. That question seems to partly address the problem(s) I have in mind. All kinds of compromising situations can arise unexpectedly when bike riding, and it can be easy to forget to lock a bike under such circumstances. So techniques are needed to easily avoid leaving a bike unlocked when such compromising situations arise. I would like a very convenient, fail-safe lock that does not depend on my remembering to lock the bike every time I dismount. If you think such things don't exist or can't be designed or developed, please try to think of "best-practices" alternatives and techniques that might be useful. I am thinking that the ideal lock would lock up the bike automatically when the bike is dismounted and could be unlocked only by key or combination or by my presence within five feet, say by a radio chip (perhaps a small RFID chip or other credit-card-like passive responder) carried by me, say worn on my belt. And of course, the lock needs to be "fail-safe" under all conditions. So it should not lock up when someone is riding it. And since the radio operation would likely depend on batteries, the lock also needs to be unlockable by key or combination when the bike is about to be mounted so that I am not left stranded if the batteries fail. It would also help if the radio operation is very low power so that batteries would last and so that the radio operation would be extremely dependable. Does anyone know of any such lock or an engineer/manufacturer who would be interested or willing to design, build, and market such a lock at a reasonable price? Are there any such people who use this bike stack exchange? If so, could could you please provide an answer? While a specific lock on the market may perhaps be especially useful, this is really a generic question that includes alternative and potential designs and techniques for solving the problem. Try to think creatively about alternative ways that this problem might be solved. ADDED COMMENTS Thurs, Mar 26, 2015, 5:23 am PST: It is clear now that most answerers are thinking in terms of big-city professional bike thievery. But that is not the problem I am faced with. I live in a small desert town, Joshua Tree, CA, although the area has growing signs of ugly, big-city life and all the problems that come with that. I have lived extensively in several different, crowded, congested metropolitan areas myself, and I know from personal experience the kinds of problems that can arise in such an environment. And I sympathize with the "hard-hearted" problems that such a life often engenders. But that is not the problem here. There simply are not enough bikes around here to make professional bike thievery worthwhile. So I think the nature of the problem for big cities is very skewed when that scenario is applied to a small-town area. That does not mean that professional bike thievery won't or does not happen here. I think the problem here is more of a random, opportunistic nature. But the general picture seems to be very different here than in big cities. I am still looking for some creative, imaginative engineering perspective in the answers. I gather that most answerers are not professional engineers familiar with the challenge of creative, imaginative, scientific design and development processes. But I appreciate all efforts to help with this problem. I realize that, for very many big-city people, professional bike thievery is a very old, thoroughly worn-out problem that does not inspire imaginative, new thinking. It's like "ya, ya, it all started with the Garden of Eden. So what else is new?" This is my first post on this stack exchange (or any stack exchange for that matter), and I now see that clicking on the "security" tag provides lots of alternative answers, which may be helpful. I do see there that there are some creative engineering designs and some imaginative engineering behind those designs. So that provides some hope. I might add that, besides relevance for local, small-town life and travel largely for errands and for enjoyable, healthy exercise, I am also interested in solving this (potential) problem for long-distance bike touring which is largely remote and rural in character, that is, remote from metropolitan areas, although I might find some occasional need to visit metropolitan areas; so I definitely do need to be aware of professional bike thievery hazards if and when I do visit metropolitan areas. I definitely think there needs to be a "rural" tag available for use here.
