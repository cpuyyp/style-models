Do professional sports teams around the world usually insure their players against injury so that if they lose the player's services, their salary is at least partially covered? If there is no insurance, it would seem that purchasing (as in football) or trading for (as in North American sports) a high-value player is an extremely risky - even if necessary - investment because of the large salaries involved. A single injury can mean the effective loss of millions of dollars due to the player not being available. 

In baseball, a player can replaced by any other player who hasn't yet appeared in the game. Can this replacement be made after a player has started batting and is still at the plate? 

A double minor counts as two separate penalties, one after the other. When keeping the game statistics, therefore, you count them separately as well. This leads to the situation where a four-minute double minor counts as two power-plays but a five minute major penalty counts as just a single power-play. 

In baseball, any player can play any position (unlike, say, rugby where certain positions can only be played by designated players). This is why it has been possible for a single player to play every single baseball position in a single game. There is nothing stopping a team playing their normal catcher as a pitcher or a starting pitcher in any other position. I think that MLB suspensions are equal for all players because pitchers are not officially registered as being pitchers. Consequently, the leagues do not enforce that a player always plays in a certain position. Therefore, MLB doesn't have the right to give a longer suspension to a player only because he usually plays as a pitcher (even though everyone knows he actually is a pitcher). The equal suspensions for all players is probably part of the collective bargaining agreement between the leagues and the players' union. 

It is not really clear if they are in the stadium or in a small studio, pretending to be watching the match live at the stadium. The last picture is especially suspicious, because it looks like the camera will be blocking the view of the match. My Doubt is based on 2 main points: (1) The commentators (and the change of commentators) will always shown from the front, and there will never be a view of the commentators with the field or players in view. (2) The commentators seem to say exactly what is shown on the screen and seem to be clueless of the ground situation. Eg 2A : On the tv, a ball going towards the boundary may look like it will cross it, while the commentators should be able to see a fielder running towards it. I have seen cases where the commentator was saying something like "going to be a four [that is what we can see] ... no, a fielder gets to it at the last moment [that is when the tv shows the fielder]", which I can make out without the redundant commentary. Eg 2B : A ball hit too high may look like a six on tv, and even the commentator will claim that it is going to be a six, but eventually we see that it has simply gone up and come down on the wicketkeeper, who takes an easy catch. After noticing this couple of years back, I have been waiting for similar comments in latest matches, but I think they have become clever and do not comment on these things now ; they wait for the tv to show what is happening and then they say what we can already see. Beyond these two main points, I noticed two other minor points: (3) I noticed that occasionally there is the light from tv screen on the faces on the commentators. (4) I also noticed that commentators do not say anything which is not shown on the tv, Eg If umpire has asked for 3RD umpire Decision, but the tv has not shown him asking for it, then commentators too will be talking about other things, like "boy-o-boy, at a time like this, a huge risk in trying to take a single [replay shows umpire asking for 3RD umpire Decision] and what will it be ? Out or not out ?", where basically, they are trying to hide the fact that they are clueless until the tv shows what is happening. We have English Commentary Broadcast (claimed implicitly to be from stadium) and Hindi Commentary Broadcast (known to be from studio) and both are similar, making me suspect that even the English Broadcast is from the studio. In recent IPL T20 cricket matches, are the commentators in the stadium or watching a broadcast in some studio ? I am not claiming that all commentaries are from studio, I am only saying that in some matches (especially T20 IPL) the studio is used, without informing the audience, but then they never explicitly claimed to be in the stadium, so they are not really lying. It may be that the studio is easier for bringing in Film Stars who do not want to get stuck in the huge crowds or traffic generated by IPL. It may be that commentary boxes are used as VIP seats, and commentators are asked to move out. ((I originally asked this on Skeptics, where it was suggested that I try here, but the wording may still indicate Skepticism)) 

There are differences between international and NHL hockey, but I believe in this case both would do the same thing: a new 4 on 4 situation is only created when there are an equal number of minor offsetting penalties to both teams. When there is an uneven amount of minors, then the officials will give the team with one fewer penalty a power-play that is 5 on 4. There are much more complex scenarios with major penalties and with the two teams having a difference of more than one penalty. The general rule is to negate as many penalties as possible before deciding who has a power-play. 

The stated rational behind the introduction of the play-off in the Turkish league was last year's corruption scandal. The idea is that when these strong teams meet each other in the play-offs there is little risk that one of them will be able to bribe their opposition to intentionally lose a game. Compare this to the 2010-2011 Süperlig season, when Fenerbahçe is accused of bribing a number of teams to lose matches and of offering a financial incentive to the opposition of their main competitors (Beşiktaş, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor). In this respect, there is an advantage to using play-offs in countries where corruption poses a problem. 

I have been watching cricket on tv for years and have occasionally seen the commentary box. Usually, the camera will be behind the commentators and the image will show the commentators watching the match from a small room, and the players will also be visible. There may be a change of commentators (somebody moving in and somebody moving out) and even then, we could see the field. More-over, commentators will be talking about events which are not visible to tv viewers, meaning it is happening outside the range of the camera. This type of video "proves" that the commentators are in the commentary box. Here are 2 views of general "proper" commentary boxes: 

Say, teamA score is 368 (369 to win), and teamB is batting at 368 (or 366). One run (or 3 runs) will make them win. The batsman hits the ball for a six, so score is 374 (or 372) which is more than the required 369. Even then the runs are counted for the team and for the batsman. Now, on the last ball, suppose the batsman did not hit a six, but ran for a single : teamB will win. Can the batsmen continue to run until the ball is dead ? Why will they want this ? (A) If batsman is at 98 and wants to reach a century. (B) If batsman has a career total of 9998 and wants to reach 1000 runs. (C) If the batsman has a very high record strike rate, and wants to remain at that record strike rate. (D) In the championship, this is the last quarterfinal, & even winning will put teamB equal to teamC, and the better runrate at the end of the quarterfinals will enable them to move to the semifinals. (E) Many similar situations can happen. So coming back to the question : Do the laws of cricket allow running on the last ball, even after winning ? In most of the matches I have seen, after winning, the batsmen do not even look where the ball is and start celebrating the win. If the rules did not allow them to run more, then fine. If the rules did allow it, then has there been any game where they did run more ?
