You might want to look at 'Vector bundles over classifying spaces of compact Lie groups' by Jackowski and Oliver. They discuss a situation in which you can understand $K(V(X))$ quite explicitly and it is interestingly different from $[X,\mathbb{Z}\times BO]$. Picking $C'$ for all $Z$ is not a terribly big deal, because you can do it functorially: just use the geometric realisation of the singular complex of $Z$. Some things work better if you define $V(X)$ to be the set of isomorphism classes of numerable vector bundles, ie those for which there exists a trivialising cover with a subordinate partition of unity. For most spaces (compact spaces, CW complexes, metric spaces, ...) this makes no difference. In cases where it does make a difference, there is a good argument that numerability should be part of the 'right definition' of a vector bundle. I don't remember exactly how much this buys you in the foundations of $K$-theory, however. It will not affect the Jackowski-Oliver examples, as their base spaces are CW complexes. 

Choose a $G$-invariant Riemannian metric on $M$. For any $x\in M$ let $U_x$ be the tangent space to the orbit $Gx$ at $x$, and let $V_x$ denote the orthogonal complement of $U_x$ in $T_xM$. As the action is free, $U_x$ is canonically identified with the Lie algebra $LG$. The spaces $V_x$ give a subbundle of $TM$. Let $p:M\to M/G$ be the projection. For $y\in M/G$, let $W_y$ be the set of equivariant sections of $V|{p^{-1}\{y\}}$. As $p^{-1}\{y\}$ is a free $G$-orbit, we have natural identifications $W_y\simeq V_x$ for all $x\in p^{-1}\{y\}$. It is also not hard to see that $W$ is the tangent bundle for $M/G$. (You have to do most of this work to make $M/G$ a manifold in the first place.) Put $n=\dim(M)$ and $d=\dim(G)$. It now follows that sections of $\Lambda^{n-d}(T(M/G))$ biject with $G$-invariant sections of $\Lambda^{n-d}(V)$. If we pick a nonzero element $u$ in the space $\Lambda^d(LG)\simeq\mathbb{R}$ then multiplication by $u$ gives a $G$-equivariant isomorphism $$ \Lambda^{n-d}(V) \to \Lambda^n(LG\oplus V) = \Lambda^n(TM). $$ Thus, orientations of $M/G$ biject with $G$-invariant orientations of $M$ (but the bijection depends on the sign of $u$, or in other words the orientation of $LG$). 

Let $d_+$ be the number of $a_i$ where the Jacobian is positive, and let $d_-$ be the number of $a_i$ where the Jacobian is negative. It can then be shown that $d=d_+-d_-$, so if $d_+\neq d_-$ then $g_\infty$ will be surjective. 

You can do a great deal with no analysis whatsoever, by defining modular forms of weight $k$ to be sections of the line bundle $\omega^{\otimes k}$ over the elliptic moduli stack. That sounds quite scary, but it can be made very elementary and concrete after a couple of pages of preparatory discussion. Deligne's "Courbes elliptiques: formulaire" is a good place to look, and quite a lot of that paper is also discussed in Appendix B to "Elliptic spectra, the Witten genus and the Theorem of the Cube" by Mike Hopkins, Matthew Ando and myself. Note that this approach gives the ring $$ MF_\ast = \mathbb{Z}[c_4,c_6,\Delta]/(1728\Delta-c_4^3+c_6^2) $$ of modular forms over the integers, not over $\mathbb{C}$. However, if you are interested in Moonshine you may want to construct the $q$-expansion homomorphism $MF_\ast\to\mathbb{Z}[[q]]$. I don't know a fully satisfactory treatment of that without using any analysis. 

[This version has been updated in response to comments from the OP] Recall that $B$ gives an endofunctor of the category of abelian topological groups. We can apply $B$ to the obvious map $\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}/2$ to get a homomorphism $S^1=B\mathbb{Z}\to B\mathbb{Z}/2$, then compose with $\det\colon U(2)\to S^1$ to get a homomorphism $U(2)\to B\mathbb{Z}/2$. The fibre of this is the group $\{(g,u)\in U(2)\times S^1:\det(g)=u^2\}$, which is easily identified with $S^3\times S^1$. We can now apply $B$ to get a fibration $$ B\mathbb{Z}/2 \to BS^3\times BS^1 \to BU(2) \to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,2). $$ (Note here that $S^1$ is implicitly embedded in $U(2)$ as the centre, rather than the top left copy of $U(1)$.) We can now apply the functor $\text{Map}_*(\mathbb{C}P^2,-)$ to get a fibration $$ 0 \to \text{Map}_*(\mathbb{C}P^2,BS^3)\times \mathbb{Z} \to \text{Map}_*(\mathbb{C}P^2,BU(2)) \to \mathbb{Z}/2. $$ Now let $P_k$ denote the subspace of $\text{Map}_*(\mathbb{C}P^2,BU(2))$ consisting of maps that have degree $k$ on the bottom cell, and put $M=\text{Map}_*(\mathbb{C}P^2,BS^3)$. From the above fibration we can see that $P_k\simeq M$ whenever $k$ is even. Next, we have a cofibre sequence $S^3\xrightarrow{\eta}S^2\to\mathbb{C}P^2$ (where $\eta$ is the Hopf map), giving a fibration $$ M \to \Omega^2BS^3 = \Omega S^3 \xrightarrow{\eta^*} \Omega^3BS^3=\Omega^2S^3. $$ It is known that $\Omega^2S^3=S^1\times W$ for a space $W$ whose homotopy and (co)homology groups are all finite. It is easy to see that $\text{Map}_*(\Omega S^3,S^1)$ is contractible, so $\eta^*$ really lands in $W$. The above fibration gives short exact sequences $C_{i+1}\to\pi_iM\to K_i$, where $K_i$ and $C_i$ are the kernel and cokernel of the map $u\mapsto u\circ\Sigma^{i-1}\eta$ from $\pi_i\Omega S^3=\pi_{i+1}S^3$ to $\pi_{i+2}S^3$. At least the $2$-torsion part of these groups can be read off (in a substantial range) from Toda's book "Composition methods in the homotopy groups of spheres". If I have got everything straight, the first few nontrivial groups are as follows: 

Suppose we have a family of isomorphisms $\alpha_A\colon A\to A^*$ for all finite abelian groups $A^*$. If $\phi\colon A\to B$ is an isomorphism, we have a dual isomorphism $\phi^*\colon B^*\to A^*$ and thus an isomorphism $(\phi^*)^{-1}\colon A^*\to B^*$. This makes $A^*$ a covariant functor of $A$ on the category of finite abelian groups and isomorphisms, and it is only reasonable to call $\alpha$ canonical if it is natural with respect to this structure. In other words, we should have $(\phi^*)^{-1}\circ\alpha_A=\alpha_B\circ\phi$ for all $\phi$, or $\alpha_A=\phi^*\circ\alpha_B\circ\phi$. In particular, this must hold when $B=A$ and $\phi=n.1_A$ for some $n$ that is coprime to the order of $A$. This means that $(n^2-1).\alpha_A=0$, but $\alpha_A$ is assumed to be an isomorphism, so the exponent of $A$ must divide $n^2-1$. This fails when $A=\mathbb{Z}/5$ and $n=2$, for example, so there is no natural map $\alpha$ as described. The same argument also shows that there is no natural isomorphism $V\to V^*$ for finite-dimensional vector spaces $V$ over $\mathbb{Z}/p$ provided that $p>3$. The same conclusion holds for $p=2$ or $p=3$ but one needs to use some different choices of $\phi$ to prove it. On the other hand, if we restrict even further to elementary abelian groups of order $4$, then you can check that there is a natural choice of $\alpha_A$. It sends each nonzero element $a\in A$ to the unique map $\theta\colon A\to\mathbb{Z}/2$ such that $\theta\neq 0$ but $\theta(a)=0$. 

This may well be the proof that you have already. Reduce to the case of $p$-groups as in the question. Put \begin{align*} n(x) &= |\langle x\rangle| \\ m(x) &= |\{x' : \langle x'\rangle = \langle x\rangle\}| \end{align*} Then $$ \nu(G) = \sum_{H \text{cyclic}} |H| = \sum_{x\in G} n(x)/m(x). $$ Now, if $x=1$ then $m(x)=1$. On the other hand, if $x\neq 1$ then $n(x)=p^k$ for some $k>0$ and $m(x)=p^k-p^{k-1}=(1-1/p)n(x)$. This gives \begin{align*} \nu(G) &= 1 + \sum_{x\neq 1} \frac{1}{1-1/p} = 1 + \frac{|G|-1}{1-1/p} \end{align*} If $|G|=p^r$, this becomes $$ \nu(G) = 1 + \frac{p^r-1}{1-1/p} = \frac{p^r-1/p}{1-1/p} = \frac{p^{r+1}-1}{p-1} = \sum_{i=0}^r p^i = \sigma_1(p^r). $$ 

Suppose that $f:\mathbb{Q}_p\to\mathbb{C}$ is locally constant. For each $k\geq 0$ the set $p^{-k}\mathbb{Z}_p\subset\mathbb{Q}_p$ is compact, so it can be covered by finitely many open sets on which $f$ is constant, so $f(p^{-k}\mathbb{Z}_p)$ is finite. By taking the union over $k$, we see that the image $C=f(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is countable. For notational simplicity I'll assume that $C$ is infinite, so it can be enumerated (without repetition) as $c_1,c_2,\dotsc$ say. Local constancy means that the sets $U_i=f^{-1}\{c_i\}$ are open, and they form a disjoint cover of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Now $f=\sum_i c_i\chi_{U_i}$. 

Firstly, yes, your examples are all correct. However, in example~(B) we just have $O(3)=\{\pm I\}\times SO(3)$ as groups, so your fibration is just the product of $$BSO(3)\xrightarrow{1}BSO(3)\to 1$$ with the path-loop fibration $$ B\mathbb{Z}/2\to 1\to B^2\mathbb{Z}/2 . $$ The same happens with $BSO(m)$ and $BO(m)$ whenever $m$ is odd. When $m$ is even, there is no normal subgroup of order two in $O(m)$, so we cannot do an analogous thing. However, for any $m$ we have an extension $SO(m)\to O(m)\to \mathbb{Z}/2$ giving a fibration $BSO(m)\to BO(m)\to B\mathbb{Z}/2$, the other way around from your example. As Dylan mentioned, fibrations with fibre $F$ are classified by maps to $B\text{hAut}(F)$. If $F$ has a group structure then it acts on itself by translation, giving a map $F\to\text{hAut}(F)$. In this context we have a homeomorphism $\text{Map}(F,F)=F\times\text{Map}_*(F,F)$ and similarly $\text{hAut}(F)=F\times\text{hAut}_*(F)$, where $\text{hAut}_*(F)$ is the space of based weak equivalences from $F$ to itself. If $F=K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d)=B^d(\mathbb{Z}/2)$ then for $k>0$ we have $\pi_k(\text{Map}_*(F,F))=[\Sigma^kF,F]=H^d(\Sigma^kF,\mathbb{Z}/2)=0$ (because $\Sigma^kF$ is $(d+k-1)$-connected). Moreover, in this case we have $\pi_0(\text{Map}_*(F,F))=H^d(F;\mathbb{Z}/2)=\{0,1\}$, with the $0$-component consisting of nullhomotopic maps, and the $1$-component consisting of weak equivalences. From this we find that the translation map $F\to\text{hAut}(F)$ is a weak equivalence in this case (as well as being a homomorphism of topological groups). This gives $B\text{hAut}(F)\simeq K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d+1)$, so fibrations with fibre $F$ and base $B$ are classified by maps $B\to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d+1)$, or in other words by Postnikov invariants in $H^{d+1}(B;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. None of this relies on $B$ being the classifying space of a Lie group, which is a bit of a distraction from the real issues here. Whenever you have a fibration as above, with total space $E$ say, you get a longer sequence $$ \dotsb \to \Omega^2B\to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d-1)\to \Omega E \to \Omega B \to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d-1) \to E \to B \to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,d)$$ in which any three adjacent terms give a fibration. In particular, we have some fibrations with Eilenberg-MacLane spaces as the base, and others with Eilenberg-MacLane spaces as the fibre. All of the examples that we have discussed arise in this way, for suitable choices of $B$ and $d$. Given a compact Lie group $G$, we could in principle classify fibrations with fibre $BG$ using $B\text{hAut}(BG)$, which is similar to $\text{Map}(BG,BG)$. If $G$ is an $n$-torus then $BG=K(\mathbb{Z}^n,2)$ and$\text{hAut}(BG)\simeq BG\times GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ by an argument similar to that given above, so this is not too hard to understand. However, even in the simplest nonabelian case of $G=SU(2)$, the set $[BG,BG]$ is uncountable and has no tractable structure, so this approach is not very useful. We can instead try to produce extensions $G\to P\to Q$ of topological groups, for various $Q$, and then take classifying spaces to produce fibrations $BG\to BP\to BQ$. This will not produce all $BG$-fibrations over $BQ$, but it will produce a class of such fibrations that one can reasonably hope to analyse. 

Recall that $H^*(BS^3)=\mathbb{Z}[y]$ with $|y|=4$. For any odd integer $k>0$ there is a map $\psi^k\colon BS^3\to BS^3$ with $(\psi^k)^*(y)=k^2y$. (I am not actually sure if $k$ needs to be odd.) There are evident inclusions $S^1\xrightarrow{i}S^3\xrightarrow{j}SU$. The composite $\psi^k\circ Bi$ just comes from the representation $$z\mapsto\left[\begin{array}{cc}z^k&0 \\ 0 & z^{-k}\end{array}\right],$$ and the composite $Bj\circ \psi^k\in[BS^3,BSU]\subset K^0BS^3$ can be described in terms of Adams operations. However, I do not know a way to construct $\psi^k$ itself without recourse to étale homotopy theory or something like that. Section 5 of Sullivan's Geometric Topology notes is relevant here. Anyway, if $V$ is the tautological bundle over $BS^3$ and $k>1$ then $(\psi^k)^*(V)$ is a vector bundle over $BS^3$ which comes from a virtual representation of $S^3$ but not from an honest representation. More recent work on this sort of thing usually has the phrase "maps between classifying spaces"; there are papers by Jackowski, McClure and Oliver, and other papers by Notbohm. 

No, at least when $p=2$ the coefficient of $x^8$ in the relevant power series is not 2-locally integral. I have put a Maple worksheet at $URL$ with a PDF version at $URL$ 

Here are three results where the conclusion is not exactly an equality in the topological category, but is something quite close to that. All three are of fundamental importance. 

First, for any $x\in S^2$ we have an endomorphism $A(x)$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ given by $A(x)(w)=x\times w$. More generally, we have an orthogonal matrix $B(t,x)=\exp(t A(x))$, which is a rotation through angle $t$ around $x$. When $w$ is perpendicular to $x$ we have $B(\pi/2,x)(w)=A(x)(w)$. Let $F$ be the space of maps $f$ as in the question, and let $G$ be the space of maps $g:S^2\to S^2$ satisfying $g(-x)=-g(x)$ for all $x$. Given a function $f(x)=X(x)+u(x)x$, put $\phi(f)(x)=A(x)(X(x))+u(x)x=x\times X(x)+u(x)x$. This gives a homeomorphism $\phi:F\to G$. Using the maps $x\mapsto B(t,x)(X(x))+u(x)x$ (for $0 \leq t\leq \pi/2$) we see that $\phi(f)$ is homotopic to $f$ and so has the same degree. It is fairly standard that maps in $G$ have odd degree, and it follows that maps in $F$ have odd degree. UPDATE: Romain asks about a generalisation for $n>2$. This seems harder. The analogous space $F$ is the space of sections of the bundle $W=n+2-L$ over $\mathbb{R}P^n$, where $L$ is the tautological bundle. By thinking about exterior algebras, one can produce an isomorphism $2^nL\simeq 2^n$. In the case $n=2$ this gives $4L\simeq 4$ so $W=4-L=4L-L=3L$, and by working out explicit formulae for this identification one is led to the proof above. If $n>2$ then $2^n>n+2$ so this approach will not work without some additional ideas. 

There is a homomorphism $\langle x,y\rangle\to\langle x\rangle$ of free groups, sending $y$ to $1$. We can combine this with the other obvious homomorphism to get a surjective homomorphism $$ \langle x,y\rangle \to \langle x\rangle\times\langle y\rangle $$ The kernel is the commutator subgroup, and it is freely generated by the elements $[x^i,y^j]$ for $i,j\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $i,j\neq 0$. We can define a homomorphism $$ \langle x,y,z\rangle \to \langle x,y\rangle \times \langle x,z\rangle \times \langle y,z\rangle $$ in a similar way, and let $K$ denote the kernel. In some notes of Vershinin I have seen this called the fat commutator subgroup. It is a subgroup of a free group and so must be free. Question: Is there a known basis? Let $X$ denote the smallest normal subgroup of $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ containing $x$, or equivalently the kernel of the map $\langle x,y,z\rangle \to \langle y,z\rangle$. Define $Y$ and $Z$ similarly, so $K=X\cap Y\cap Z$. Put $$ A = \{[u,[v,w]] \;:\; (u,v,w)\in X\times Y\times Z\}. $$ It is easy to see that $A\subseteq K$. There is a comment of Vershinin which might mean that $A$ generates $K$, or it might mean something a bit more complicated. In any case, the document that I found did not contain a proof or reference. Also, I think that $A$ is too big to generate $K$ freely.
