What is "X", is a convenient form/method, for the person making the inquiry, to obtain the listener's understanding/definition/knowledge of "X". 

Yes, it would be possible for a group of individuals to agree on any number of "rules," but without consequences, or the means to enforce the rules, they could become useless. 

I think that "idealistically" it would be of benefit to those being governed, to have competent, knowledgeable, ethical, honest, etc. civil servants. However, "realistically" it does not happen, because those being governed can't (or don't want) differentiate between those leaders/persons that have (or meet) the "good" requirements, from those that "claim" they have them, or even those that "obviously" don't have them! This is one of the reasons we have the "Electorate College" to try to avoid fools from electing incompetent, dishonest, unethical, etc. civil servants, but as history has shown, we have not done that great. Although I don't expect great improvement, your idea has the potential to improve the system, and if implemented, I feel it would be no worse than the current system. 

The answer depends on the "initial conditions." If we start with a baby, and somehow we provide sustenance so that it does not die, it will not learn/know anything about other people. Will not even know what "fulfilled life" means. If we start with a very social person over 20 years old, the most probable answer is no. He/she will not have a fulfilled life. If we start with an antisocial hermit, it is very likely that he/she will have a fulfilled life. 

Sentence [1] is false because it is not making a distinction between imagining (now), and being "there" (at the funeral, in the future). As long as you are alive, you can imagine anything, no matter how weird or illogical it might be. However, when you die, you will not be able to imagine anything, specially if death turns out to be final. 

The answer to the first questions is yes. An action can have a moral attached to it. For the second question, the answer is yes, the intention behind the action has a moral attached. The third question is not meaningless, because an action can exist without intention. However, most actions do have a moral attached because most actions do have an intention. Since all actions that have an intention have a moral attached, the only actions without a moral attached are those that don't have intention. One of these type, are those committed by those incapable of having intention (incapacitated, naive, innocent, etc.). Another type, are those committed without thinking, or as a habit. 

I believe the closest term is "false equivalence." Just because some component of B might not be in A, it does not mean that all components of B must not be in A. For example: If we define, a solid(S) is not a liquid(L), S -> ~L. It does not follow that a solid(S) is now excluded from having any of the other properties of a liquid(L). Both could be green, have the same temperature, same volume, etc. 

The first step is to agree (or realize) that there are three levels/types of reality. 1) local(individual), 2) global(group), and 3) absolute reality. This realization is key so that the different sides/groups can understand each other. The relativistic group is correct when the "reality" they refer to is the local type (each individual can have his/her own interpretation of reality). The global reality is the observed reality as agreed by the consensus of a "large group" of people (current reality). The absolute reality can be attained, only by continuing to augment the global reality - until the "end of time" (future reality). As time passes, our global reality encompasses more and more of the absolute reality. What this implies, is that at any one time, we have a mixture of reality types. We have our own reality, the group reality we accept, and a portion of the absolute reality that we are able to perceive. The reason your torture example "works," is because of the portion of the absolute reality that each of us is aware of. 

To understand the quotation, one needs to understand what is meant by reason and passion. It is commonly understood that "reasonable" persons think before acting, whereas "passionate" (emotional) people, act without thinking. So, "reason" is associated with logical, methodical, reasonable. "passion" is associated with emotional, illogical, unreasonable. Most logical (reasonable) persons see themselves as having control of their emotions, whereas passionate people are thought of as being controlled by their emotions. What David Hume is saying, is that those that think they have control of their emotions, are only fooling themselves, because they are "rational" only to the extent that their emotions allow them to be. An example of this, is love. If you are in love, reason "goes out the window." So does sight, reasonableness, thought, and logic! 

Although I don't consider myself a materialist, I perceive your thought experiment as fundamentally flawed and a very poor attempt to prove that at least the "perception of color is independent of material." Your logic fails because you are assuming that when MR is presented to twin B, he experiences PB (which is different from PR). 1 - The only way your assumption could be true, is if twin B's "perception system" is "wired" differently than twin A. This would be a material difference! 2 - If the twins have no material difference ("wired" the same), then twin B would experience PR (same as twin A), when presented with MR! The only conclusion is that the perception of color is not independent of material! 

The "quick" answer is no. However, because you used the word "every feeling", it will take only one feeling without thought, to negate the premise. Typically, thinking is a capability associated with "higher intelligence" forms. However, "lower intelligence" forms do have feelings, even though they are incapable of thinking, therefore, there is "feeling without thinking." 

I agree with you. I too feel that there is something missing. It needs something like "One should not treat others in ways (that the society one lives in considers "bad" or) that one would not like to be treated." 

No, Aristotle would not regard an artifact like a CPU as substance because it fails his second test, "ultimate object of scientific inquiry." The "ultimate object" of a CPU would be the silicon atoms, not the CPU itself. 

Infinity, as a concept, exists in mathematics. Not only are there different types of infinities, but there is even an infinity of infinities! Physics also makes use of mathematical infinities (integrals have to be evaluated from - and + infinity), but in keeping with the intent of the question, there is only one physical object that comes "close" - the universe. The universe is discontinuous at the edge, and therefore, (by definition) it is infinite. 

The answer depends on the definition of "pacifist." If your requirement to be a pacifist is, "reject the use of physical violence under any circumstance," then the answer is, yes it is a contradiction. However, if the requirement is only to decrease/reduce/minimize the amount of violence, then the answer is, no it is not a contradiction! 

I believe that a possible metric would be - does the introduction of the current level of technology (driverless vehicle, etc.) improve (less crashes, etc.) the current status? If yes, then it is ethical to introduce it. The "imperfections" that might result from the "introduction" can be dealt with similarly as we do now with the imperfect human. 

The answer to the main question is no, a UBI would only "raise the standard of living" of the population, it would not eliminate the "exploitation" in capitalism. The reason for this, is that as long as a person wants something additional, or even to maintain what he/she already has, some sort of "resource" has to be spent. Having to spend some resource (labor) in exchange for the "goods" obtained, is what "enslaves" us. Therefore, if we define this "exchange" as exploitation, then the exploitation will never be eliminated, no matter how high the "standard of living" gets.
