Runner's Toe is an entertaining way of having someone being very tender on their feet for a few days, and then recover quickly. Maybe your assailant just stubbed their toe badly, had something fall on it, or he's trying to get into running and wore shoes a size too small, or walked downhill all day. It looks pretty gruesome as well, so despite being maybe a bit on the harmless side, it could integrate into a horror story nicely. Also, even a little girl stamping on someone's Terrible Toe is a great way to cause distracting levels of pain. 

Camouflage: You can attempt to hide a base on the moon, because the moon is pretty big, and people expect it to be there. An orbital base is more difficult to hide. Armor: The surface of the moon is covered in craters, due to constant bombardment by rocks and ice travelling at up to orbital speeds. An underground moon base could be protected from this bombardment - and also from most weaponry (if they come with planet busters, your station doesn't matter anyway). This will also help with protecting a crew from radiation. Gravity: On the moon you don't need artificial gravity to stop everything from floating around. This is quite neat, when it's a manned station. On the other hand, lower gravity and lack of athmosphere means you can launch small craft quickly and easily - something a planetary base cannot provide. Mass of the moon: Your station will likely have a mass lower than the moon. Using an orbital space station to fire rail guns at an adversary, would change it's orbit. You would be limited to smaller, recoilless weaponry in most cases. The moon is a convenient emplacement for your heavy interplanetary artillery. Less collateral damage: Any shot that would miss an orbital defense station, could hit the nearby planet or be drawn into its gravity well, making for potentially devastating collateral damage, even from an unsuccessful attack on a military installation. The moon is more likely to provide a buffer for destroyed craft and malfunctioning/misaimed weaponry, where it wouldn't impact a planet's fragile ecosystem. 

One solution would be to have the opposite of the normal problem: a disease that the natives are immune to but the invaders are highly susceptible to. The invaders died by droves trying to conquer the local population. Another possibility is at least some regions of highly rugged and inaccessible landscape that the natives could retreat to when under attack. They would know this area very well for some reason or another (mineral resources, religion, needing to go through it to travel, etc.). Their knowledge of this area and the close quarters imposed by the landscape would eliminate the advantage of the European firearms and horses and would allow the natives to essentially fight off a siege. Or they could live in such areas all the time to defend against attacks from other groups, like the cliff dwellings of the Anasazi. Still another possibility would be for Atlantis to have a handfull (maybe 3-5) large kingdoms constantly at competition and war with each other. They would be adapted to the sort of political intrigue and subversion the Europeans used against the Inca and Aztec empires, and would likely be prepared to deal with siege warfare in their own territory. Some combination of these factors would probably make for a good story. 

These walls are all designed to keep out humans, but will work just as well on large wildlife and zombies. They are all at the kind of scale you are looking at. Their construction has been usually under adverse circumstances. By most metrics, they did their job. They are expensive in manpower (constructing and manning) but mostly low-tech (mines, some lights, sensors), and reasonably low maintenance. Given these examples, I'd say walls are pretty well proven, and an efficient way at reducing the surface of potential attacks. 

The soul needs time to leave the dead body - it's not something that happens in the moment of death and is done with. Over the lifetime the soul has become attached to the body, and only the slow decomposition in a hallowed ground will ascertain that the soul rises whole and intact into the afterlife -- and maybe even beyond to rebirth! Burning the body would also destroy parts of the soul, tearing it apart and not allow it to experience the afterlife at all. A most cruel act, reserved only for the worst of criminals and enemies. Incidentally that very link between soul and body is how necromancy works: It reanimates the body, and the remaining bit of soul will take over the operation of the body. Once the Necromancer's spell is broken, and the artificial conservation of the body, which binds the soul, is no more, the soul will be able to reform in the afterlife, merely suffering a delay, where it is split in two. Although similar to the "ghost" suggestions above, I don't think it's necessary to have and might add unnecessary complexity to a world. After all, a soul's wellbeing should be of paramount importance to the ex-loved ones of the body in question. 

A more selfish reason: the Gods have limited reserves of power. Affecting the material world drains them of a little bit of their power. Perhaps this power takes a long to regenerate, or perhaps they have a total amount for their existence and they die when it runs out. So they teach humans not to rely on them so that they either have power when they need it, or so they can extend their own lives. 

One possibility is to avoid the problem entirely by making the place you store the dishes also be dishwashers. So you put dirty silverware in the silverware drawer, and clean silverware comes out. The drawer detects dirty silverware and washes them automatically. The cupboard where you store your plates and bowls also washes those plates and bowls if they are dirty. The cupboard where you store your pots and pans cupboard also scrubs and washes those pots and pans. If you take it a step further, you don't deal with the storage at all. You stick your dirty dishes in a machine. The machine washes them, sorts them, and stores them inside itself. Next time your kitchen makes a meal, it knows exactly what dishes you will need and the machine provides them for you. The washing, storage, and retrieval would all happen on belts behind-the-scenes. 

This answer is probably a bit more memetic than some others, which may or may not be suitable for your world: One Nation Didn't Get Any Of Those German Rocket Scientists MAD burns down to ICBM delivery - you can stop bombers quite effectively (at least from reaching population centers) using nuclear tipped SAM/AAM - which are less complex than ICBMs due to the lower range and lower accuracy required. So, as long as any one side has less than around 100 (non-MIRV'd) missiles - then MAD isn't assured. Missile production facilities probably wouldn't recover from any "limited" nuclear strike. With that as our given assumptions, here's the scenario: Operation Paperclip is either a resounding failure or a resounding success - one side of the victorious blocks gains the largest part of the German rocketry know-how and thus gains a head start worth 10 years in rocketry (already the soviets had a slight lead with intercontinental rocketry in the real world). What would be a reasonable prerequisite for this to happen? The Soviets, arriving in Germany first, continue moving the front as far west-ward as they dare, to capture German assets of any kind. Or: The German rocket scientists fled en-masse to surrender to the Allies, hearing of the atrocities the Soviets committed during their approach. As the years move by, one nation continues to hold a significant technological advantage in rocketry, making the availability of a compatible warhead the limiting factor. Once this has been designed, a first-strike enabling ICBM force with little counter-force from the opposing side is available. This puts one side at a deciding advantage, and anticipating the MAD doctrine they strike first, eliminating enemy airfields in a first strike, and then defending only against the airborne alert bombers heading for their territory. To pick up your example of the Moscow criterion: Defending Moscow against incoming bombers should be very much possible, since they would all have to come via the arctic and would face interceptors with nuclear tipped anti air missiles. Some more technical notes: In the end a credible first strike is mostly based on missile accuracy - you need to be able to wipe out airfields with hardened bunkers and carrier groups, as well as strike deep underground command and control bunkers with multiple weapons. 500 meters of CEP will not get your very far, but is plenty to take out civilian/industrial targets. So a slight lead in rocketry and guidance as actually happened was not enough. You need <100m CEP intercontinental accuracy, before your enemy has meaningful intermediate range (~1000-3000km range) missiles. You could still strike Moscow with dozens of nuclear IRBMs from southern Germany or vice versa. This would put the USSR at a disadvantage, since they cannot strike the mainland US with IRBMs. They could hit London though - whether this was considered an acceptable loss for a US-led NATO, I don't know. 

Electromagnetic waves can carry information, but as far as we know they can't process information without some sort of physical object to mediate the interactions between the waves. So the aliens could convert themselves to waves to travel from one place to another, but they would need some physical object that could carry out the computations their brains normally would carry out at either end. It would be like copying their brains from one location to another, they would not be capable of any thought while traveling in wave form. Even if they could be waves, there is a problem with the idea of them being "all around us". Electromagnetic waves face a number of problems when traveling over great distance that would degrade the quality of the information in the waves. They get smeared both in time and space, they lose energy, they get absorbed, their frequency shifts based on the relative speed of the source and destination as well as the general expansion of the universe. On top of that electromagnetic waves are pretty slow, potentially taking decades or even centuries to travel interplanetary distances. Further, the Earth itself is really good at absorbing electromagnetic waves, so if they were all around us they would be dying as the waves containing them were absorbed by the Earth. Of course you could throw out the rules of physics as we know them, but then there isn't really any way to answer the question. 

Until they cease to get outside help: Sure, not everyone will survive, but I assume that some powerful people will be trapped, who have the ressources/allies to get outside help. If you have holes that big in the top, those can be used to air-drop supplies into the dome. Obviously, as the other answers have indicated, there will be quite a lot of death and destruction, but given the right resources (a boat might be incredibly helpful) you can probably weather the initial violence. Once order has restored, air-dropped supplies should keep you alive for a while, and you may even be able to reproduce. Being a nitpicker, the likely cause of death will be flooding, since your design allows for incoming water, but there's no drainage at the bottom. Eventually the sphere will fill with water up to the level of the holes, and survivors would again have to resort to boats or rafts. Since the sphere reaches several kilometers into the sky, there may also be an issue with people freezing or suffocating, depending on the altitude of the lowest holes. In that case no water or air would really circulatethrough those holes, so I suspect that the holes are only around 1000 - 2000m above ground. With six-inch-holes, you can even get newborns out, once the water level is high enough, allowing for your successors to leave the sphere. 

No. The answer to your title question is "yes", there is nothing about black powder specifically that makes it inevitable that it would be discovered before steam power. But your full question is a very different one, with a different answer. It isn't really feasible feasible for steam engines to be developed without gun-like weapons also being developed. The simple reason is that the same principles used in a steam engine can be used in a projectile weapon: a steam cannon. In fact, such a weapon is considerably simpler than a steam engine and designs of such weapons predate any usable steam engine. Steam guns were never used in warfare because by the time the technology was made to manufacture them in usable numbers and quality, easier-to-use gunpowder was available. But if gunpowder were not available, steam guns would have been a natural outgrowth of the much more complicated steam engine development. It is true that Heron made a very early steam-powered device long before gunpowder or steam guns existed. However, this device wan not a practical way to use steam to power machinery. It produced far too little power to do anything useful for a feasible amount of water and fuel. The machinery to get useful work out of steam is much, much, much more complicated. 

So, unless your base is the size of an Imperial Death Star, you would do well to keep it under the surface of the moon. As an advance outpost, a base on Pluto or similar sized rim-planet would be pretty neat, but out there you wouldn't be able to rely on solar power as much (at least for day-to-day operations), as on the moon, so you'd need either another locally available power source, or ship fuel out there every so often. My assumptions are of course only valid, if the moon in question is similar to the Earth's moon, and generally considerd inhabitable, with significantly lower gravity than a reasonably nearby planet. In a solar system with inhabited moons around a gas giant, you would probably want to have your defensive perimeter outside the planet's gravity well. 

It isn't really feasible. They would need an unbroken line of trees stretching the entire distance. Unfortunately, there are deserts and planes in the way. You can see this map of tree cover for North America: 

There could be as many pathogens as there are types of self-replicating organisms or molecules. Bacteria and eukaryotes are earth organisms. Other planets would likely have radically different organisms, any of which could be a pathogen. Both single-celled and multi-celled organisms can act as pathogens here on Earth, so alien single-celled and multi-celled organisms (or even organisms that lack anything we could identify as a cell) could be pathogens. It wouldn't have to be a full organism, any self-replicating molecule could be a pathogen, as long as it can successfully enter the body and find the raw materials to replicate inside. This could include molecules not found on Earth. It can also include molecules that are found on Earth that have the potential to self-replicate, but don't currently self-replicate on Earth, such as RNA or DNA (there are "naked" RNA pathogens, viroids, but they use a cell's replication machinery rather than replicating themselves, and in the cell RNA and DNA need other molecules to replicate). Similarly, prions work by causing other proteins to mis-fold into more prions. But RNA and DNA also fold in important ways, so there is a potential for RNA or DNA equivalents of prions to exist (although as far as I am aware none are known). Finally, from what I have found there is one (and only one) group of organisms on Earth for which no known pathogenic forms exist: archae. However, archae are particularly hardy, often living in extreme environments. This could make pathogenic archae hard to defeat with our natural defenses or medicine.
