Always train antagonizing muscle groups for best attempts at maintaining balance. In other words, if you are training a muscle that moves your body in one direction, train the muscles that will move it back into the original position. Biceps flex your arm - Triceps extend them. Forearms flex your wrists - your Extensors raise them back into place. Etcetera. This opposing force strength training will keep certain imbalances in check. However, you should also stretch all of your muscle groups well. This will prevent injuries and imbalances also. 

You generally take care of this issue by accurately describing the exercise. Forgive my conversions. I'm used to dealing in lbs. Preacher Curls w/ french bar - 34.8kg (explained below), 2 sets, 8 reps Versus Preacher Curls w/ dumbbells - 17.4kg, 2 sets, 8 reps With the first example, you'd have 14kg on each side of the 6.8kg bar totaling 34.8kg (if you use certain safety clamps it could add more weight). Because the French Curl Bar is used with two hands, the workout implies a shared load. The second example implies that, while done right arm then left arm, that the same weight was lifted the same way by both arms. Think of it like Right Arm = ½ a set and Left Arm = ½ a set. In cable machines, while the calculated weight due to pulley mechanics is slightly different, if you have to move 2 pins (right arm stack left arm stack) treat it like dumbbell curl example. If there is only one pin to move (even if you can move each arm independently) treat it like the French Curl Bar example. 

The biggest difference is your ability to increase or decrease workload (or amount you're moving). Pull downs can allow the person to pull as little as 10 pounds (right right there are variances in actual weight versus stated weight depending on the machine) while pull-ups are limited to a minimum of user body weight. There are machines that offset user weight for pull-ups that could even out this discrepancy. The other is availability. Anywhere there is a ledge/bar/etc over head, you can do pull-ups. Lat pull-downs are limited to machine access or potential stretchy band (we call them thera-band) with fixated overhead point access. The other factor that stands out for me as a big difference is the use of stabilizer muscles when performing pull-ups. Unless you are trying to kip-up for cross-fit-like pull-ups, or muscle-ups... you have to have good form and a tight core to keep from swinging back and forth. 

Breathing in any irritant is bad for overall lung health. I suggest following @cbll 's information on identifying air pollution and guidelines for your given location. In terms of "...are treadmills sufficient?" Yes and no. Running on the ground is always harder than on a treadmill. Being able to run longer on a treadmill does equate to overall aerobic endurance... Just not on a 1:1 scale. You can try to accurately mimic courses with grade (though downhill sections would require a specialized treadmill mimicking that downward-slope); but, ultimately the treadmill is assisting you to some degree. Defining long-distance is also important... Half-Marathons, Marathons, Ultra-Distance Marathons all require similar but different training that also include strict diet and sleep schedules. If you are serious about becoming a long distance athlete, it would be a good idea to find a local trainer for more advice. Also, consult your physician to make sure nothing in your medical history contraindicates long distance/endurance training. 

The Fitness.StackExchange link provided by @Adam is great and probably the most complete when answering your question directly. The actual calculations for treadmill v road grade are as follows. This link talks about calculating grade from a treadmill. 

It depends on what you want to be able to do. Isometric contraction work outs major downfall is they only train the range of motion you are using (90º for example). This means if you wanted to have the same "grocery lifting" strength anywhere else in your range of motion you would have to move to that angle and train that portion (45º). You would then be less strong at all other angles than 45º and 90º. Isotonic training (provided you use full range of motion for the given exercise) will allow you to work towards a given weight through a full range of motion. Using bicep curls as an example.. You will be weaker at the beginning of the exercise (when your arm is straight) than you will be at 90º. 

This can get VERY tricky. The reason you normally rest between workout days is to give your muscles time to recover from the muscle breakdown that occurs from lifting. I have heard of people breaking upper body routines into "arms and shoulders" and "chest and back." The reason I do not prefer this method is due to the fact you still use muscles from your arms while you are doing chest and back (and vice-versa). While they are not the primary muscles being used, they are still being used (think about how much your tricep helps when you are bench pressing, or how much of the front of your shoulder you use when doing an incline press). I think hard leg routines are one of the most missed opportunities by weight lifters. For one, you don't want to look like the Hulk on stilts. But doing squats utilizes large muscle groups in a compound way which is very beneficial for your body (not to mention tough). 

The same input values for bicycling @ 14-15.9 mph yields a burn of 784 calories per hour. While there is no doubt the unicycle takes more skill to ride (especially if you're climbing hills), it is not using as much muscle consistently as the bicycle. As one who has never unicycled for fitness or ever... I can't speak to the intensity (in terms of aerobic exercise) this modality provides. As a coach and motivator - If unicyling is going to encourage you to exercise and enjoy what you're doing. DO THAT!! Pay little to no attention to the calorie difference at first. Get to a healthy place in terms of enjoying the exercises you are participating in and then worry more about the calories. Depending on one's diet... If you started unicycling and dropped one 20 ounce Mountain Dew (using the same values/calories burned above): 

I think that if anilkumble has no knowledge of the terms or physiology of what he is asking it will be hard for him to make a well thought out question. So instead of belittling him we should hep him figure out what he wants to know. Anilkumble, You asked what major areas you need to target (Butt, Thighs, and Legs) in each region. Did you mean exercises? You have four major muscle groups in your legs. Your butt (glutes), the front of your thighs (quadriceps), the back of your thighs (hamstrings), and back of your legs belos the knees (calf muscles). There are also supporting muscle groups on the front of your hip (hip flexors), inside (addductors), outside (abductors), and beside your shin (anterior tibialis). I hope this helps you make a more concise question. 

1) You should face the machine. Facing away can work but it forces you into some bad posturing. 2) You should find a place for your arms to stay. If you prefer arms straight you should let your biceps an lats be relaxed. It is very easy to use the muscles in your arm without realizing it. If bent is more comfortable, once you get in the right position, you should lock everything from your chest up in place. This will ensure that you don't try to pull down with any other muscles. 3) Your body should be straight from shoulders through your waist to your knees. When you perform the crunch think of moving the ribs right below your pecs into your belly button. Exhale while you crunch. This will help you engage your abdomen as well. 4) This depends on your level of strength with your core. If leaning at even an 80º angle makes you sway your back or pooch out your butt it is too far. The further your knees are from the machine the harder it will be. This is because not only working your abs this way, you are also having to use all of your stabilizer muscles to keep from falling forward. 5) Try to be conscious of yourself and not others. Everyone is different and starts at varying levels. Just do your best with the best form possible and you will be okay! 

There are some other ways to calculate body fat other than the weight to height ratio or measuring waist and hip circumference. 1) Bio-electrical Impedance. This method uses a machine to send a small electrical impulse through your body. You normally have to input your Age, Gender, Height, Weight, and Physical Activity Level. The more information you put in the more accurate these types of machines are. Depending on how much fat is present the signal will slow down denoting more fat is present (because fat is a poor conductor of electricity). The machine then calculates your body fat. Being dehydrated can skew the results of this test.Link Here 2) Skin fold test. This test involves using a caliper to measure the thickness of a specific area of the body. There are anywhere from 3-9 sites from which a trained professional can take the measurements from to calculate the results. The more sites you use the more accurate the measurement will be. If the calipers are calibrated appropriately and the person taking the measurements is trained appropriately, the test is 98% accurate.Link Here 3) Underwater weighing. This test can be done 2 different ways. One is in a tub meant for this type of measurement with a trained professional and computer for calculating water displacement and underwater weight measurements. The second can be done in a pool and, using a special scale, measures the subject's weight under water. This method relies on physics and the known buoyancy of fat, muscle, and bone. A common "hiccup" can be the learning curve. The person being weighed has to be very still and used forced expiration (exhaling as much air as possible, forcibly) and remain under water until the professional can get all of the readings they need. Link Here There are more Listed Here tests; but, the first three are the more commonly used (common because they don't require the purchase of machines that cost thousands of dollars).
