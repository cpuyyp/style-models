Keep in mind the way they're defining "white noise" in the scientific american article you provided is different from what you link to on wikipedia. The SA definition is more in terms of ambient noise (e.g., traffic, low-level talking, a/c running, etc.) while white noise proper is a signal with a VERY specific acoustical pattern. It seems that the SA article is relating to deterioration in performance due to the stress caused by the increased attentional resources required to "tune-out" the ambient noise. If white noise proper completely eliminates all other ambient noise (without being too loud of course), this eliminates the allocation of these additional resources. Because white noise proper is essentially featureless, one will habituate to it unlike common ambient noise. Carlson, Rama, Artchakov, & Linnankoski (1997) found a significant decrease in memory when exposed to music during a memory task and a significant increase in performance when exposed to white noise in comparison to a control which had only low level ambient noise. Though it was not the main purpose of the study, the authors conclude that music drew attention away and thus interfered while white noise likely drowned out the ambient noise without drawing attention and thus improved performance. Please keep in mind the sample of this study was on monkeys, but the processes are expected to be generalizable to humans. Daee & Wilding (1977) found that the likelihood of forgetting during a free recall task is related to the level of noise to which one is exposed during rehearsal such that recall is best in a quiet environment and degrades at 75 and 85 dB. Though this study was not on concentration directly, these results can be seen to have applicable implications regarding attentional resources. Along these same lines, Salame & Baddeley (1987) found significant differences in recall between unattended speech versus white noise such that unattended speech interferes with performance while no statistical difference was found in the white noise condition (in comparison to a quiet control). The authors conclude "...that noise does not interfere with short-term memory but that unattended speech does impair performance..." The studies I cite above are related to memory recall tasks which, though involving similar processes to long-term concentration are not perfectly comparable. However, there is a pretty comprehensive literature showing the effects of noise exposure having negative effects on long-term tasks such as learning (e.g., Hygge, 1993, Lercher, Evans, & Meis, 2003). Additionally, Mathews & Canon, 1975 state "data [suggests] that arousal leads to a state of restricted attention or cue utilization in which attention is concentrated on salient features of the setting at the expense of its other aspects" which does not hinder attention to "central or salient events." This idea is related to the theory that noise facilitates functioning through the stimulation of processing such that increased arousal yields better performance until over-arousal occurs which then decreases performance (Hockey, 1983 from Staal, 2004). Stall (2004) also discusses the possibility of continuous v. intermittent noises having differential impact such that continuous may be beneficial while intermittent is harmful, though there is no current agreement in the literature (see pages 88-91). Thus, the literature seems to support the following: White noise will improve performance to the extent to which it masks noises that may cause over-arousal or attention shifts away from the task without causing over-arousal itself. Practically speaking, if you're in a quiet environment, white noise is unlikely to have a positive effect on your concentration. If you are in a somewhat noisy environment, white noise will likely have a positive effect. However, in a very noisy environment it will likely have either no or a negative effect.

You can search the bill yourself for those amounts (that add up to well over 1/3 of the total $50 billion the bill allocated by the way) and read the details for yourself, but it appears that the funding is mostly disaster relief related. 

No. WP fact checked this and scored it 3 pinocchios WP did reach out to Cruz's staff for clarification on what does the senator consider "pork". Here is what they were told and their analysis on it: 

In US popular culture, it's often asserted that white people are more prone to commit certain types of crime that are "crazy", such as serial murder, child abduction, mass shooting, etc. This is often portrayed in movies, the most recent example being "Get Out" (which I saw last night): Here is a quote from the movie: 

A lot of reputable news media outlets base those estimate on this site: $URL$ So it appears that the cost of the program was around $314 million, 20 bombs were delivered to the military thus the unit cost was ~ $16 million. It's not unusual for the first unit to have very high cost because of large capital investment (research, design, machines, etc) but the variable cost (how much it costs for materials & labor to build a bomb once you have all the facilities) to be fairly low. So the first bomb might be $200 million, the next 19 another 120 million, thus the average unit cost is $16 million and total program expenditure $320 million. If they build a 1000 more, the unit cost will probably go down. 

The Washington Post fact checked this claim and scored in 2 (of 4) Pinocchios. While it's true that the number of Syrian Christian refugees admitted to the US is disproportionately lower, it's not clear why. The WP article lists the number of Syrian refugee for 2016 by religion as: 

But not all vitamins/minearls are safe for all people; if you have certain medical conditions, there are vitamins you should avoid. Also, certain vitamins are toxic if you take too much. But there are also certain conditions where you need to take extra of certain vitamins. That's why it's important to ask a doctor what's right for you. "Nutritional supplements" is a very broad category of everything except food and pharmaceutical drugs. It includes vitamins/minerals, but also include a wide variety of things. It includes herbal preparations like Echinacea or St. Johns Wort (which btw is really essentially an antidepressant medication, complete with drug-interactions and side effects), to things that claim to build muscle, to things that claim to make you smarter, to the random new weird supplements with magical weight loss claims (like you see advertised on website banners everywhere, "1 weird thing I did to lose 1528735 pounds" or whatever). People often take these in hopes that it will help some aspect of their health - and some do help. Some are good. But others don't do much at all. - and worst, some do bad things. This is where we need to pause and talk about safety, because there are vast inconsistencies between supplements in terms of safety, efficacy, and truthfulness of claims. There is something essential that we all need to be aware of: Vitamin and nutritional supplements in the USA are not monitored nor investigated by the FDA, so there is no governmental monitoring of their content, quality, nor accuracy of claims of what they do. This does not mean that all are worthless or unsafe. It means we have to be careful consumers of supplements. At the bottom, I have links to look at interactions with other medications, as well as a couple notes on how to spot a good one. From [$URL$ 

Because I certainly do not trust my life to companies' honesty, I am very wary about nutritional supplements before I take them or tell a patient that something they're taking is okay. I make certain I read lots about them - and not just the company's own propoganda, but actual research. See below for resources I recommend. It's also critical to mention that nutritional supplements often have pharmaceutical properties - MANY pharmaceutical medications are derived from plants as well. And "all natural" means nothing in terms of safety - cyanide is an all natural, plant-derived substance too. If you decide to take a nutritional supplement, ALWAYS check to be certain that there is no interaction with a medication you're taking, or with another supplement. Check Medscape's Interaction Checker $URL$ for interaction information on pharmaceutical drugs - they have some nutrition supplements and vitamins, but nowhere near all of them. With supplements, most interactions have simply never been tested - and therefore no one knows if they're safe. It's always best to ask a doctor for advice before starting a new supplement. How to spot a good multivitamin or supplement 

I was listening a discussion on poverty on CSPAN radio this morning and Robert E. Rector from The Heritage Foundation claimed that 25% of the Earned Income tax credit is fraudulent. Specifically, the claim was that 25% of the money goes to people who misreport their income or people who don't have the "relevant child in their home" (I'm guessing divorced parents claiming dependents on their taxes that live with the other parent). Is there any evidence that 25% of the EITC is payed improperly? Edit: Link to the program, the claim is made around 21:30 

That definition was given in the 2004 rules for Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the definition used by some US courts (more info) More traditionally a combatant is someone taking part directly in an armed conflict. It seems very unlikely that any male over 15 would automatically be considered a combatant purely based on their sex and age. The claim seems to suggest that to be the case even when civilian targets were hit. This would violate a number of US and international laws and there are no evidence to that effect. 

Yes those numbers appear to be correct. The Cato instituted published "Terrorism and Immigration A Risk Analysis" in September 2016. From that report: 

I traced the graph to this paper by Hsiang-Wen Hsu and Hsiang-Wen Hsua at University of Colorado Boulder. It was published in 2012 in American Journal of Physics. The paper is behind a paywall so I can not link to it, but I read it and it appears correct. The authors watched video from the Apollo Moon walks looking for certain frames in which dust was kicked up by the buggy. Using those frames they measured how high and how far the dust went - that's the blue squares on the plot. This is possible because they know the frame rate and resolution of the video footage. Using the wheel of the rover as an yard stick (16 inch wheel), they can convert pixel sized to meters. Time is also know from the frame rate. Using ballistic motion equations and accounting for linear drag they calculated 4 trajectories - 2 with Earth gravity (green dashed lines), 1 dust trajectory from the data they extracted from the video and 1 expected Moon trajectory using the actual moon gravitational constant. Here is the paper's summary: 

In the mid 90's, the number of new supplements being produced each year was so high that the FDA to keep up with on top of medical pharmaceuticals that need to be tested, so safety monitoring was limited to pharmaceuticals. I wish that weren't the case, but that's how it goes when health safety doesn't get enough funding. We're left to to rely on supplement companies to be honest in their safety data. And we've seen plenty of times how less-than-honest advertisements and overly-ambitious (or just outright lying) claims supplement companies sometimes make - the FDA has had to step in numerous times to stop supplements that turned out to be unsafe, like the recent Hydroxycut FDA warning to "stop using immediately," which is also a class action lawsuit. The FTC even has had to step in where the FDA didn't on Sensa for example. To make a new supplement, according to the FDA, if an ingredient has already been 

Trustworthy websites that the medical profession uses: Medscape, Medline Plus (NIH), UpToDate, [epocrates] (an app, not free)10, NetWellness.org, mayoclinic.org, and other medical university-based health websites. There are also commercial websites and shows like WebMD, Dr. Oz, The Doctors... those are commercial companies/websites/shows that get revenue from ads and from talking about "cutting-edge" topics. I myself am skeptical about what I hear from them and read up about it myself on more scholarly or peer-reviewed websites. 

Razie's right. Let's talk about vitamins/minerals and other nutritional/dietary supplements separately. (Nutritional = dietary, which is used in the sense of what we eat, not used in the sense of weight-loss "dieting" - although weight loss supplements also fit in this category). Many vitamins and minerals are absolutely essential parts of our diet - they play roles such as co-enzymes for many physiological functions, including the immune system. Vitamins are things like A/C/D/B vitamins; Minerals are things like Iron or Calcium. With a very well-balanced diet, we can get everything we need through our food - but most people in this country don't. Some foods (like cereals and rice) are "fortified" or "enriched" to be sure people are getting closer to 100% of the most essential ones because people often aren't (especially kids who are in a critical growing stage). If you want to be certain, you can track your vitamin intake using a nutrition calculator that includes vitamins/minerals. Eating a wide diversity of colors of vegetables and fruits is one way to help get more of the vitamin/mineral spectrum. For most people who don't carefully balance their diet, taking a regular multivitamin is a very common and appropriate way to cover the bases of what's necessary. Also:
