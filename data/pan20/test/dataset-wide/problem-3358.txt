The trees for these two sentences are almost identical, except for the changed I. (The fact that "-ed" then goes off and affixes itself to "walk" is attributed to movement, or explained away by "that's morphology instead, not syntax, so it's someone else's problem".) Notably, this is the same place where "do"-support happens: the auxiliary "do" appears as an I. However, this is different from auxiliary "be" and "have", which are actually Vs. Hopefully that clears it up! 

This is called an "expressive loan": when a loanword is reanalyzed to fit into the patterns of the new language. If an unfamiliar, archaic, or foreign word shifts into something meaningful in the new language, such as expatriate → ex-patriot or Alzheimer's Disease → old-timer's disease, then that's called an "eggcorn". And if the loanword keeps its original form but is given an incorrect etymology in the new language, that's a "folk etymology". There's significant overlap between these three. 

It's for historical reasons, really. If I were looking at that Spanish data in isolation, I would agree with you: I'd call the phonemes /b d ɟ ɡ/, then say that the stops became fricatives in certain environments (and that the palatal stop was realized as an affricate elsewhere, which is a very common thing for palatal stops to do). But with Spanish, we aren't looking at it in isolation: we know what phonemes Latin and other Romance languages had/have, so we know the diachronic changes that led to today's Spanish. In particular, /b d ɡ/ come from Latin /b d ɡ/, which were almost always [b d ɡ] (indicated by Latin grammarians' descriptions, transcriptions into other languages, and what happened in other Romance languages). But /ʝ/ came from Latin /j/, which was (almost?) always [j]. So it makes more sense to say that the approximant /j/ became a fricative /ʝ/ which sometimes becomes [ɟʝ], than to say that /j/ became /ɟʝ/ directly. In other words, [ʝ] is the most conservative form, while [ɟʝ] is more innovative. 

The Wikipedia page on lexical sets has various tables comparing the vowels phonemes that correspond to each multi-dialectal diaphoneme. The first table compares General American to RP; I think that is the one you will find most useful. Two caveats: the tables don't include consonants (although there have much less dialectal variation than vowels in English), and they also list lexical sets that correspond to the same phoneme in different dialects (you'll have to filter these out to meet your requirement of "highlighting the difference"). 

Do we need to add a new phoneme to the list of English phonemes (as shown by the minimal pairs bitten-bittern, pattern-patten, seven-Severn)? Or is it just an occasional idiosyncratic or artificial distinction? 

I don't know of any language that strictly meets these criteria, certainly not any major language, but there are some almost-but-not-quite cases: 

From a draft of Lawrence Trask’s Etymological Dictionary of Basque, with abbreviations expanded by me: 

English verbs ending in -s would be a huge list from -ss alone, but but there are only a few ending in -es that I could find: 

If you're willing to consider outright speculation, it's worth mentioning Sorin Paliga’s Urbian theory. According to this theory, there is a pre-Indo-European root *ol- / *ul- / *or- / *ur-, connected with the concept of a town, present in this Basque word, Latin urbs, the name of the Swiss city of Uri, the name of the Iraqi city of Erbil, Greek labyrinthos and several other words. 

The very rare phenomenon I'm talking about is a part of a word that indicates that the word encompasses a number of hyponyms, which are arrived at by replacing that part. It is probably easier to understand by example: 

ħ In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this sound is written /ħ/ (conveniently enough): a voiceless pharyngeal fricative. Since you mention ḥ, I'm guessing you've studied Arabic or a related language? It's like English /h/ but with a lowered larynx, or Arabic ح. /ħ/ is usually written ḥ when transcribing Arabic, though I personally prefer writing ħ. għ This letter has a few different pronunciations. At the end of a word or before h, it's like ħ, but longer. Before a vowel, it lengthens and pharyngealizes it. According to Wikipedia, "għi and għu are [aˤj] and [oˤw]". 

In the first example you give, you're using a standard derivational suffix of English: -ing attached to a verb forms a gerund noun, that is, a noun referring to the action itself. But in the second example, you don't use any standard verb-forming suffix. You just treat the noun as a verb. If you want to make an understandable verb, you can use a suffix like -ify: while it sounds ridiculous, "lampify" clearly means to turn something into a lamp. For a less ridiculous-sounding example, shifting a problem to another subfield of linguistics might involve semanticizing or morphologizing it. Both of those verbs (and the gerund nouns derived from them) are clear in their meaning, even though I just invented them on the spot. 

In this case, the past tense is the only option: *that he believes, *that he believe, *that he is believing all strike me as ungrammatical. So perfect and pluperfect forms don't always have a past-tense meaning in hypotheticals. I'm afraid I'm not too familiar with the philosophical terms. But "it is possible that my hair is green" and "my hair could be green" do both seem like "epistemic" possibilities. In other words, my hair could be green, since you can't see me right now to know otherwise. But I don't mean that there's any possibility from my perspective that my hair might actually be green. I can see it, and I know that it isn't green. If I said my hair could have been green, however, there are two interpretations which both strike me as correct. It could be past-tense "epistemic" possibility. 

Is there a name for the "morpheme" (if you can call it that) *, foo and @ in the examples above? Has this phenomenon ever been the topic of an academic study? 

The following theories that try to explain the origin of Proto-Indo-European numerals are mentioned in J. P. Mallory, D. Q. Adams, The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World: 

I'm aware that [ən] can be reduced to [n̩] in some circumstances. Does this possibility also apply to [ən] that comes from former [ɚn] in non-rhotic English dialects? I have had limited contact with non-rhotic English (mostly television), but I only recall hearing eastern as [ˈiːstən] rather than [ˈiːsʔn̩] 1, while words like prison are commonly heard with either [ən] or [n̩]. The only information I could find was these blog comments: 

Michele Pasqualino, in Vocabolario Siciliano etimologico, Italiano e Latino (1795) mentions a similar connection (Latin venula), and expresses doubt that it comes from veniendo. Note the age of these sources. I've been unable to find more recent ones. 

Since the asker has clarified that the language in question is Spanish, the likely explanation is that they are hearing the pronunciation in a dialect that exhibits yeísmo, which causes /j/ and /ʎ/ to be pronounced the same (usually [ʝ]). If that's not the case, what I recommend is finding some minimal pairs in languages that have these phones and listen to them until you can recognise the difference. My native language, Portuguese, does; here are the links to the pronunciations of the minimal pair malha (with /ʎ/) and maia (with /j/). 

All of them, except maybe to yes, have limited usage (i.e. they are slang, archaic or just plain rare); your program doesn't really need to take them into account unless you want to be super comprehensive or you plan on using a very specific corpus (for example, add res if your text comes from online video-game forums). 

Clearly, NP1 "Alex" is not NP2 "himself", and NP1 "Alex" does not dominate NP2 "himself", or vice versa. But every node that dominates NP1 "Alex" (namely, the S) also dominates NP2 "himself". Therefore, NP1 "Alex" C-commands NP2 "himself". This is important, because it seems to be how reflexives work in English: the NP "Alex" C-commands the NP "him", which makes it change from "him" to "himself". But if "Alex" is buried any deeper in the tree, as in "the man who works with Alex saw him", then "Alex" no longer C-commands "him", and so no reflexive happens. 

The German case you cite is separate from the English one. In Germanic languages in general, there never was any third-person imperative. But when German borrowed the T-V distinction from neighboring languages, the second person plural (Ihr) took on a polite singular meaning. And later, when this stopped being polite enough, the third person plural (Sie) took over that role. But German had no third person imperative, so the subjunctive was used instead. Bitte rufen Sie ihn is syntactically a subjunctive, and thus the Sie isn't optional (since German isn't pro-drop), unlike in geh [Du] weg. In English, however, and in informal German (using the original second-person pronouns Du and Ihr instead of Sie), the subject pronoun is usually implicit. This is by far the most common case cross-linguistically, at least in my experience. By "implicit" I mean that the pronoun still there, but it doesn't appear on the surface. In a language like Ancient Greek, which marks person on the verb even in the imperative, this implicit pronoun still triggers second-person marking. And in English (and several other languages), the implicit pronoun still triggers reflexives: "go let yourself out", not *"go let you out". This would only be expected if there were an invisible subject pronoun there, C-commanding the reflexive. (There are, in fact, certain constructions that look like imperatives but don't have this implicit subject! My introductory linguistics professor would use "bless you" as his only example of this, but "damn you" and many other expletives fit also. See McCawley's paper under the pseudonym "Quang Phúc Đông" for the details.) The subject-verb inversion here is particular to Germanic, and doesn't quite match any other construction in the language. For example, English negative imperatives use "do"-support even when the verb is "be": "Don't [you] be late!" This doesn't happen in normal indicative sentences: *"He doesn't be late". So the best I can say for this is, it's a special construction used only for imperatives.
