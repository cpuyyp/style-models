As the image shows, it uses very simple notations consisting of only two symbols: a square and a circle. The accompanying text explains that a circle means beat the drum, while a square means beat the smaller war drum. This composition is difficult to date. The Book of Rites, in its modern form, was compiled during the Western Han dynasty, 206 BC – AD 9. However, that was a reproduction of much more ancient contents, purportedly produced during the Eastern Zhou dynasty, 770 BC - 256 BC. Much of it were destroyed during the Qin dynasty and recreated from memory by the old masters. However, the chapter on Touhu is known to be part of a large collection supposedly found hidden in the walls of Confucius' old home. These were turned over to the Han dynasty government to assist in the reconstruction of the Book of Rites. Assuming this is correct, the drum score contained within Touhu must have been created before 221 BC or so. 

- From left to right, the columns are: Class, Graduation Date, Number of Grates, Top Graduate, Number of Generals from the Class, and Names of Generals. As you can see, the top graduating student from the 17th class was Shinoduka Yoshio , and from the 18th, Yasui Toushi . Neither of them resemble Jiang Baili much. Even if we account for the possibility that the dating was off, he is simply nowhere to be found in either the preceding or subsequent years. Since Jiang was apparently not the top graduate, the story that he received a sword for being the best pupil is clearly wrong. 

Likewise, racism was very much in existence in Early Modern England, at a time when English settlers were creating colonial America. Consider Shakespeare's Othello. Iago roused Brabantio with vivid imagery of a black man "tupping" his daughter, and threats of black grandchildren: 

Lyon's theory is rather flawed. First of all, the Etymologiae was written in the 7th century. Just because one paragraph from one chapter in the book might possibly be construed as implying a flat earth, does not mean serious scholars for the next 1,000 years all believe the earth to be flat. Without direct evidence of medieval scholars calling the Earth flat, one cannot possibly extrapolate a single book's alleged errors to an entire continent. The existence of Newton's extremely influential work does not prove 21st century physicists 400 years later are unaware of relativity. 

Because the medical profession was opposed to it. Roosevelt's administration feared that including the universal health insurance provisions would kill the entire Social Security Act. 

In contrast, the Vietnam War was a essentially a prolonged counter-insurgency operation within the territories of South Vietnam. There was no treaty to oblige American allies to participate in such a conflict. Nor was there any call to arms by the United Nations for defending South Vietnam. The United States could ask and apply pressure on her allies for help. Nonetheless, with the lack of any real legal obligation, it fell to each government to decide whether participation was worthwhile. New Zealand, for example, was reluctantly pressured into sending a token force. Great Britain resolutely refused to officially participate, but sent assistance covertly - British soldiers ended up fighting in Australian and New Zealand units, for instance. French arms had already fought in Vietnam before, and were bloodied by it. I don't think French public opinion could have supported a second trip to the quagmire especially now that they had no empire to fight for in Indochina. Moreover, French-American relations were not the best during the 1960s. Around the same time the Untied States began committing significant combat troops, France was in fact withdrawing from NATO. 

Peter promoted such socialisation beyond the royal court, as well. In 1718 he issued an edict on "assemblies", public social functions, which were to invite women. 

The unambiguous answer is indeed the coronation of Karl IV, as King of Hungary, on 30 December 1916. 

The simplest explanation is that Edward did name Harold to succeed him. Of course, in the absence of a tape recorder, nothing is proof beyond a shadow of doubt. Yet, history is the study of the recorded past. To dispute Edward's bequest, an argument should at least address what the primary sources say and explain any differences. Not just conjectures based on random websites. 

It is, however, more likely that the local climate was simply less conductive to the plague's spread. 

In terms of the objective you defined in the question, the Shu army had a reasonable chance of success. Liu Bei's army held two significant advantages: 

Official attitudes caught up with popular usage by the time of the 1840 convention. That event appears to be the first to be titled the Democratic National Convention. The party did continue to make sporadic references to being Republican, apparently treating it as a synonym. However, by this stage Democratic Party had clearly became the favoured name, a situation reinforced in the 1844 convention. 

Naturally enough, the Roman Emperors were no exceptions, though they may have been under more pressure to keep their activities hidden from the Roman public. Tiberius for instance was said to have bought numerous prostitutes to the relatively remote island of Capri. Similarly, the historian Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus reported that Nero tried to hide his night life of sexual debauchery.

They looked in England, but nothing came of it. During the Greek War of Independence, a commission investigated Cornwall, England for descendants of the Palaiologan dynasty. Supposedly, a certain Theodore Palaiologos of Pesaro in Italy died there in 1636. The Ferdinando Palaiologos mentioned in the question was one of his sons, and he died at Barbados on 3 October 1678. A grandson died serving in the Royal Navy in 1694. However, there is no reliable evidence that this Theodore Palaiologos really is a descendent of the Imperial House of Byzantine. According to local sources, Theodore traces his descent to Thomas Palaiologos, the last Despot of Morea and brother to Constantine XI the last Emperor, through a son called John. History however only knows Thomas to have two sons: Manuel, who surrender to the Turks, and Andreas, who is considered to have died childless. 

Jokes about sex or genitals were also extremely popular. One of the most famous example is The Miller's Tale by Chaucer. Essentially a sex comedy, it is replete with tales of a sordid affair and even anilingus. No doubt the clergy, with the ideals of chastity as espoused by the Christian church, was not supposed to approve of such lewd stories. Moreover, see this scene where Nicholas grabbed Alison by her genitals: 

There are no set ages for participating in combat. Generally speaking however, the first battle for a young samurai was in their early teens, roughly around 15 years old (opportunities permitting). Examples include Hōjō Ujiyasu at Ozawahara in 1530 (15), Takeda Nobukatsu at Temmokuzan in 1582 (15), and Date Masamune against the Sōma clan in 1581 (14). Cases of samurai fighting at younger ages, such as Uesugi Kenshin in 1543 during the Echigo Civil War (13) or Kikkawa Motoharu at Koriyama in 1541 (11) are rarer, and probably limited to children of prominent families. General mobilisation orders, at least, were largely issued to able bodied men aged upwards of "fifteen". In the traditional East Asian system, that is equivalent to 14 years old in modern terms. Conversely, many notable samurai did not experience their first battles until about 20 years of age or even later, for example Chōsokabe Motochika at Nagahama in 1560 (21). Participating in combat is somewhat linked to adulthood in that it was generally limited to "adults". In Medieval Japan, the coming of age event for boys was known as genpuku (). This involved bringing the child before the family god, changing him into adult clothes, and giving him the haircut of grown men. The child also loses his childhood nickname and acquires a formal given name. Upon completion of these steps, a child became an adult in the eyes of the law and customs. For example, Oda Nobunaga was born in 1534 and named Kippōshi (). His genpuku was held in 1546 at Furuwatari, at which point he assumed his more familiar name of Kazusa no Suke Nobunaga. However, there was also no set ages for genpuku during this period. While most boys probably held theirs between the ages of 12 to 16, there has also been extreme cases going as early as the age of six: Tokugawa Yoshinao was born in 1600, but held his genpuku rites in 1606. This is obviously wildly unrealistic for participating in combat, so adulthood isn't quite the same as going into battle. 

Of course, the Vikings had been ravaging all of the British Isles during this period, not just England. Around roughly the same time as the Danelaw's formation, other Vikings conquered Western Scotland and the islands of the North Channel, including the Isle of Man. Here they established the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, which would persist until 1266. In addition, the Vikings also captured the islands of Orkney and Shetland during the 9th century. These islands were ruled directly by the Kings of Norway, and was only taken by the Kingdom of Scotland until much later. 

This is a fair bit before my time, but the first two photographs at least seem quite reasonable. They're both technically from the 1970s anyway, and so doesn't contradict your impression. That said, while systematic security screening at airports were only implemented in the 1970s, limited checks had already been introduced in certain airports during the preceding decade. This was done in response to the rise of hijackings and terrorist attacks. In the US at least, this was voluntarily done on the urging of the FAA, in airports from where hijacked flights had originated. 

While this described English exports to America, the following passage gives a nice impression of how international trade was conducted at the time. 

There was a lawsuit between Frankfurt and Hanau which lasted some 212 years. In the late 16th century, a dispute broke out between the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt and its neighbour the County of Hanau over rights to a wine tithe. The tithe was formerly owed by the farmers of Hanau to the abbess of the White Ladies Convent in Frankfurt, but the city became Lutheran during the Reformation and secularised the convent. After the last abbess passed away in 1588, both the municipal government of Frankfurt and the Count of Hanau laid claim to the tithe. In 1594, Frankfurt and Hanau brought their dispute before the Reichskammergericht. Instituted in 1495 as the Holy Roman Empire's highest judiciary, the Reichskammergericht gained a reputation for being extremely slow in reaching a final verdict, with cases routinely taking decades to be resolved. By the time it came to an end, it had such a massive backlog that it was joked the court hung the files up, and attend to them as they fall to the ground (due to mice chewing on the strings). Their case would remain pending in court for the next 212 years, until the Reichskammergericht was dissolved along with the Holy Roman Empire itself in 1806. 

For context, there was as many as 1,400 voyages per year on the aforementioned Osaka-Edo route by the higakikaisen cargo ships around 1700.

It relied significantly on the native populations for conducting its fur trade. 

This is probably a slightly garbled account of the destruction of Shuri Castle in Okinawa. During the Second World War's Battle of Okinawa, the battleship USS Mississippi shelled the historical Ryukyu palace for three days prior to its capture by US marines.

As tohuwawohu pointed out, this law doesn't appear in some versions of the Twelve Tables. It is worth noting that the original Twelve Tables were long lost in antiquity, and any modern rendition are in fact reconstructions based on quotes or paraphrases in other sources. For the vast majority, the table number is unknown. The organisation by table is thus a modern categorisation of convenience with little more than educated guesswork. All this is to say, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the exact form of the Twelve Tables. It is indeed possible that this specific law did not actually exist, though I have no specific reason to doubt the edition TheHonRose cited. Assuming it is correct, the interpretation in this answer is I believe valid.
