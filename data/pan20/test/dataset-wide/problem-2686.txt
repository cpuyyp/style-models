It depends on how you define sound and that is precisely the philosophical point. See the first dictionary entry here: 

It's important to note that logic isn't needed for platonism to work. Platonism is the view that mathematical objects exist and their structures are all matters of fact about the objects themselves, not about a conceptual framework we can use to describe them. Even further, it might be true that there are mathematical truths that are not reducible to a logical system. If that were the case, platonism would be fine but logicism would not. Nominalism As a converse to mathematical platonism, there is also the view of mathematical nominalism which is the corresponding anti-realist view in the problem of universals outlined above. Nominalism's main concern is the denial of the platonist view that mathematical objects are abstract objects. Arguments such as Quine's are heavy enough to require responses from nominalists so much of the contemporary work done in this school of thought is to save science (as well as regular mathematics) from platonism, so to speak: 

Russell's theory of descriptions was his attempt to apply the tools of logical analysis to problems in the philosophy of language. Russell's theory is what is called a mediated reference theory, or sometimes an indirect reference theory. This is because in Russell's theory, we do not directly reference things. Instead, we describe things in a specific way such that the things we want to reference are uniquely satisfied. This leads to the very confusing and unnatural sounding sentences such as those in your example, but it is easy to following along with his examples and understand how they mean the same thing as the more natural sounding English expressions they replace. Why Russell advocated such a seemingly unnatural position is because of a series of puzzles discovered by Frege about language that caused Frege and others (such as Russell) to begin the modern study of the philosophy of language. One puzzle in the philosophy of language is "how can we reference things that do not exist?" commonly called "the problem of apparent reference to non-existentials" and Russell's famous example is: 

This view of language is in sharp contrast with theories such as the canonical Fregean/Russellian theory of meaning. Generally, Fregean/Russellian theories of meaning hold central the idea that propositions hold meaning and are somehow semantically related to the world. The idea that language, propositions, and definitions are well defined in central to this view. Even Wittgenstein shared this idea in his early days in the Tractatus: 

The biggest trouble that you will face when thinking about these ideas is that you are mixing terminology from two distinct fields into one. Some of those words are used very differently in science than they are in mathematics. It can become even more confusing when you consider how much math is used in science, but an explanation of how the words are used in their specific contexts will help illuminate the delineating line. In mathematics, "thesis", "hypothesis", and "conjecture" are all used synonymously. From Wolfram's Mathworld: 

If in the course of interacting with an external world, a person is creating a set of coherent knowledge about this world, then there should be a mapping between their beliefs and the external facts. In this case, surely something can be held to be true both through correspondence and coherence definitions? 

Observing and reporting investigator's own subjectivity. A kind of auto-ethnography. Use of Experience Sampling Method- realtime notes recording experience, often made at fixed times during the day. 

Top levels of the Cyc Model But reasoning over ontology largely still assumes that knowledge can be explicitly represented and relies on deductive logic, so the two are something of a package. This knowledge representation hypothesis has often been criticised: 

For a social phenomenology, many see a crucial element to be the structural analysis of communication patterns and practices. Conversational Analysis (CA) analyses interaction through patters of: * Turn-taking, with turns often made up of multiple construction units (TCUs); * Turn design, the selection of action and verbal constructions to achieve these; * Social action, the action being achieved (and the particpants' understanding of this); * Sequence organisation, the shape or pattern of a set of turns. Discursive Psychology is the analysis of discourse for psychological insights. It often deals with elucidating folk psychology, for example analysing the relative use of power-relate, emotional and cognitive terms in social exchanges. 

It might be argued that some of the most direct representations of experience exist in art and literature, in which case analysis of these forms will yield phenomenological insights. A challenge for this approach is how to distinguish the imagined as opposed to a "genuinely felt" experience. That said, many philosophers do use examples and thought experiments based on fictional cases. [1]: Cerbone, 2. 2012. Phenomenological method: reflection, introspection, and skepticism In: Zahavi, D.

I would be interested in pointers to papers with novel methods or examples of using mixed methods. I have also heard mention of the use of fiction/artistic evidence, but have yet to come across this and would be interested in examples. 

Semi-structured, exploratory interview, focus group or diary study. Inductive and iterative bottom-up analysis and identification of emergent themes. A reflexive method, sometimes with e.g. use of reflective journal to to capture decision making and learning by the investigator. Importantly, and therefore distinguishing the method from e.g. grounded theory, is the ideographic focus - analysis of a unique person-in-context. Thematic analysis focuses on experience - emotions and feelings, cognitive and behavioural reactions. 

The methods of phenomenological theorists As Cerborn points out[1], leading phenomenologists rejected normal scientific methods as a way of accessing experience. Nor is the method to be seen as one of introspection, but is rather outward looking, toward "the experience in and of itself". The methods of the theorists are instead often described as modes of reflection. Husserl introduced the idea of "phenomenological reduction" which required a detached attitude to reflection upon consiousness. For Heiddeger, phenomenology was the method itself, the way of describing Dasein (existence). Merleau-Ponty described his method as "hyper-reflection" or a "hyper-dialectic", which is aware of the limitations and contradictions of trying to describe things using ideals. Reflection needs to therefore be acutely aware of it own limitations. Methods from other disciplines These still call themselves phenomenological in approach, but are broader than philosophy and include social science and psychology. As noted above, they do not necessarily share the same view of the best way to access and describe experience with hardcore phenomenologists. 

The key to understanding the italicized part of your question is “in itself”. If the first state of matter is the cause in itself (and does not become the cause as a result of something else at a certain point in time), it means that all the effects or subsequent changes in states of matter start following immediately as soon as this first cause exists, without any delays, without any exceptions, with strict necessity. Cause “in itself” cannot be “inactive”, cannot exist without causing the following effect - it would be a violation of a law of nature. Thus, the period of time between that first state of matter and the current moment will always be limited, finite, with a beginning (the first cause in itself) and an end (the current moment). No matter how long this finite period of time is or can be, it will be always shorter than the infinite time in the past. If we imagine such first causal state of matter, we would have to move it into past infinity and thus all following states of matter, including the current moment, would also be in the infinite past, or as Schopenhauer says, “they must have existed from all eternity”. Schopenhauer is consistent and insistent in his ideas and arguments. So, when we are not sure that we fully understand his thoughts or ideas, further reading of his works can reassure us if we interpreted his ideas correctly. For example, here is how Schopenhauer «answers» your question directly: «But now, in the case of the honestly expressed cosmological proof through the assumption of a first cause, and consequently of a first beginning in a time absolutely without beginning, this beginning is moved up higher and higher by the question: Why not earlier? In fact, it is moved so high that we never reach down from it to the present, but must marvel that this present did not itself exist already millions of years ago». (WWRII, chapter IV, p.43-44 in Dover Publications, Inc. Ed.) And furthermore: Schopenhauer explains why any cause in itself cannot be in a state of «inactivity» by pointing to the connection of the law of causality and eternal forces of nature. «…the law of causality finds complete application, and admits of no exception, to all things in the world, in accordance with their form of course, to the variation of these forms, and hence to their changes. … if we try to comprehend it [the law of causality] in a purely objective way, then fundamentally and ultimately it rests on the fact that every operative or causative thing acts by virtue of its original, and thus eternal, i.e. timeless, power [force of nature]. … Completely different from the cause, this force is nevertheless what imparts to every cause its causality, in other words, the possibility of acting. … Therefore its present effect would necessarily have appeared infinitely earlier, and so prior to any conceivable time, if the temporal condition for this had not been lacking. This condition is the occasion, i.e., the cause, by virtue of which alone the effect appears only now, but now with necessity; the cause assigns it its place in time.» (WWRII, chapter IV)
