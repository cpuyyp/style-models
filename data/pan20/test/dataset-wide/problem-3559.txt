While there may be some slight degradation of the protein molecules I wouldn't expect enough to worry about. The biggest risk is that the mix will go off. What's food for you is also food for bacteria and fungi. I would recommend keeping it in the fridge or somewhere cold before you drink. Basically, a whey protein shake is just milk with extra bits of milk added to it so store it as you would milk. 

Your questions suggest to me that you have not done major distance on an elliptical machine (or the road) before. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you treat this like a road marathon and follow all the normal advice for that e.g. if you can do 10km now then a 4 month programme will have you in shape to complete this. Clothing, nutrition and hydration: As part of your training you will be doing long workouts. Trial a range of options and find what works for you. The standard marathon advice will apply. Lastly, what don't you just do a road marathon? Much easier to train for than being in the same room for hours. 

I'm not a doctor but I'm theorizing a little here. Your hands don't need much blood when you're running - thus you're body is taking blood from them and sending them where it's needed (i.e. your breathing muscles and your legs). That could explain the cold hands. I'd probably just wear some gloves for a while until your body adapts. The sugar-craving and cramps are probably a separate issue. You are probably under-fueling. You don't say how long it took you but 15km is probably around 90 minutes. I would consider taking at least an electrolyte supplement during your run. That would deal with the cramping. There are two causes of cramping. One is that your muscles are under-trained for the loading and have run out of the capacity to keep firing. The other is that there's not enough calcium and magnesium (and, to some extent, sodium and potassium) for them to fire. I'd also re-consider your fuelling strategy. You should practice whatever you're going to drink or eat at the race. You can choose to use some kind of sports drink (e.g. whatever the race provides or something that you do). It's quite possible to train your body to run off your fat metabolism and thus only take water and electrolytes - this is an advanced strategy that I wouldn't try for your first marathon though. 

I would recommend a Nathan trail running pack. I've used Nathan, Camelbak and some other designs. The Nathan is more comfortable than the Camelbak because it hugs you more and therefore distributes the weight around your core better - and in a more balanced fashion. Certainly, around here nearly every runner I know uses Nathan. The larger packs can carry quite a lot of stuff. After all, they're designed to carry 2L of fluid, clothing and some safety gear for up to 30km at a time. I'd suggest that getting anything bigger is going to slow your running down too much. 

The current view in ultra-running circles is that NSAID and the slight dehydration often present in long runs make the risk of rhabdomyolysis too high - hence they are normally not taken. It used to be the ibuprofen was so commonly taken that it was called Vitamin I. Aid stations would have bowls full of them for runners to take. In an email to the ultra list, Jennifer Jurynec said: 

Possibly. I know a lot of people who have had some really severe and longlasting IT band issues and have done the work and then successfully come back to running. For severe issues, which yours appear to be, I would suggest getting good advice from the appropriate specialist. In this case, I would find a good physiotherapist with good knowledge of running. I would expect them to put you on a program of rest, following by a lot of stretching. The issue is that you will have a blister on your IT band where it crosses the tightest point, right beside your knee. You need to get that blister to heel properly, then get your IT band to remain loose while slowly building up the volume. If you do this too fast then you will re-blister the IT band and have to start again. I cannot speak to the leg length or orthotics issue. Personally, I remain unconvinced of the effectiveness of orthotics. Your experience may vary. 

Ligament strain in your ankle? You're now past a week so most of the swelling should have gone away. My advice is to go see a physiotherapist. They will help you out by: 

Having your feet turn out while running is normally caused by over-pronation. During your running motion your arch will naturally collapse at the start and then rebound to its normal arch shape as you toe off. That process is called pronation. When you over-pronate you do that too much - which leads to splayed feet. Shoe stores will sell you motion control shoes to help correct it. However, there is no evidence that this actually helps. Nor are there any scientifically evaluated strengthening methods to help that I know of. I run quite splay-footed and I know, from experience, that I need a fairly stiff shoe or I start getting injuries (tendinitis in the front of the shin in my case). However, take it from me, you can run 100km with splayed feet just fine. I'm not fast but I can still get the job done. 

Your circadian cycle is synced to the real time using light. As soon as you can, start exposing your body to light (preferably natural) in the morning of the timezone you want to be at. Then, during the night, make sure it is dark. So, when you get to the US, go for a short early morning run. Alternatively, figure out what the race time is in your local timezone and do some training at that time. This will accustom you to what it will feel like. 

I would consider trying to land on your fore- or mid- foot and not your heel. There is good evidence to suggest that this reduces the sudden, large impact transient forces of heel-striking. To quote from that Harvard study: 

If I'm running in a hot race then I'll dump a glass of water over the back of my head (targetting the area just where my neck meets my head). Why? I want to reduce the risk of heat stroke and other heat related problems. If that area of the brain gets too hot then I have a very serious problem. More than that, I find that sense of relief it brings to be very useful. It helps me convince my body that things are under control and it should just keep on going a bit longer. I wouldn't do it for a half-marathon - why waste the time when you're only out for two hours? 

It's certainly more interesting running outside. Treadmill running (or wind training cycling) is very boring and takes a lot of mental toughness to complete. Running outside with friends is far more interesting. Certainly, I find that running on trails is something that makes me happy. That's a very personal answer which doesn't answer your specific questions. If you enjoy your exercise then you're more likely to do more of it; that's your benefit. 

Lastly, I recommend a liberal usage of some form of lubricant (I use BodyGlide) around your nether regions. This is especially important for long races, when it is wet and when it is hot. The most important advice is to try your system out thoroughly well before the race. Race day is not the time to find out that your system chafes! 

For all the information you ever wanted to know about foot care for long-distance athletic events read Fixing your Feet by Jon Vonhof. 

I agree with @ChristopherIckes' answer. I would add that I think you're running too far too soon. I would do a beginner's running program for 4 months to get to running 5km safely. I would also advise seeing a physio. Your symptoms sound like a knee cap tracking problem which is often caused by weak muscles which a physio can help you with. 

I've never extensively run stairs for training but they're far better than running flat (even that 20m hill is pretty flat). If your climbs are up to 8km (eeuch!) then you need to simulate that in training. I would probably starting progressing the stair run to be the equivalent. Bear in mind that an 8km is very difficult mentally - you need to be able to keep going. The other thing to worry about is the down-hill on the other side. You need to have the footwork - and the confidence in your footwork - to be able to manage it. 

If they're not causing injuries then they're absolutely fine. If all you're doing is walking a few kms (and the distance is much less than what you're running) then they're perfectly fine. If they start wearing so much that they change your walking style or you start getting symptoms of injuries (such as shin pain) then I would chuck them. 

Oh good lord - don't try it in boots - you definitely will break an ankle. @alord1689's answer is pretty good. I would expand on it and say: 

Find time each week for a long, slow distance run on a day when you're not lifting. This is the key to any long distance training and you will have a very difficult time if you don't do this. This is where the running-specific adaptations are built up. You should start at about 10km and build it up by 10% or so every week. Trying to do both lifting and running means that you won't be really good at both. Be prepared to not increase your lifting as much as before. Be prepared to not run as fast as you might. Build in a rest day where you neither lift nor run. Adaptations come from the rest after training so give your body that time to rest. I would take one of your mid-week non-lifting days and make it a running speedwork day. I would start by doing some hill work (such as warming up for 2km, running up a hill quite hard before cruising down the other side, repeat that for 30 mins, then cool down for 2km or so). Do that for 6 weeks then progress into doing a tempo run (warm up for 2km, run at half-marathon goal pace for 6km, warm down for 2km). I would then try and fit in another run in on a lifting day (specially if it's a non-leg day if you do that). The purpose of that run is just to get more time on the legs so I'd do a relaxed 8-10km or so. 

Make sure that your shoes fit and that the toe box is roomy enough for your toes without being so large that your foot moves around too much inside the shoe. Keep your toe nails short - the edge of the toe nail should not hang over the toe. Then use a nail file and file your toe nails so there are no rough edges hanging out to catch on socks. You file in the direction of the toe from the top. 

This was covered in a recent article in the British Medical Journal, Mythbusting sports and exercise products. Their summary was: 

Pain on the outside of your knee? Many possible causes and I recommend consulting a physio who is experienced with runners. Most common cause is IT band syndrome. The illiotibial band is a length of flesh that runs down the outside of almost your entire leg. In some runners, this gets tight with long runs. It then starts rubbing on the tightest point, the bones around your knee, and you get a blister. Treatment is rest. Prevention is lots of stretching. The web has a ton of information on this. 

Accurate? Against an objective measure like the water test? No? Against itself? If you do it the same way every time then probably. I use the same protocol each time. For me, it's early morning just after my shower. That way I'm getting consistent results and can then see the trend over time. For most purposes that's just fine. 

The problem is that you're conditioned to run on a treadmill and are transitioning to a road down-hill too quickly. Your heart and lungs are prepared but your legs aren't; so you need to train them. I would do something a little like a beginner's training plan. You'll need to start by walking and then walk-running before you can actually run. Yes, it will be very frustrating because your heart and lungs can run the distance. At the moment, your legs can't and that's why you're getting pain. @JimClark's comment about forefoot/minimalist running is useful. While I'm unconvinced by Vibrams per se learning to run on your forefoot is definitely an advantage. (I think most people who move to Vibrams don't take the time to adapt to them properly and get problems.) 

Dying on a 5km run? I think you need to run longer. It sounds to me like your endurance is not very good and you're simply finding it easy to hit your limits. Dying in the middle of the run is something that can happen if you've had a long tiring day or you're running too soon after a previous workout (this goes for any distance if that distance is near the limit of your ability). I would take 1 day a week and make it your long run day. I would work up to running 10km by increasing the distance you run by 10% a week. Keep the pace as slow as you like. At the end of that you should find running a 5km fast really easy. 

"I've read somewhere that ultra running is bad for your body" From where? Is the source credible? Generally speaking, I think there's a perception that long distance running is bad for you. However, I've never seen any credible science backing this up - and I keep an eye on the science. Bear in mind that there's solid evidence that running long distance was how our ancestors got to eat I find it difficult to believe that it does serious damage. 

Are you sure you just haven't pulled your laces too tight? You have probably returned to running too early and have been favouring the injury leading to problems elsewhere. 

With running, generally you get muscle pain from Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). The currently accepted theory is that this comes from stressing the muscle beyond what is is currently capable of. The DOMS is a symptom of the remodelling processing which yields a stronger muscle for that work. In your case it appears you've experienced DOMS in other leg muscles. This suggests that your quads and hamstrings are adequate for the current load you demand from them. This would be a good thing! If you really wanted to stress your thigh muscles then I would recommend hill running. Both running up a hill and running down it will stress those muscles. If you're in marathon shape or similar then two hours would work (modify to suit your current level of training).
