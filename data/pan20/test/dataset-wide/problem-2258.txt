Generally "X gives way to Y" rules can be found not just on trails but on open water (steam gives way to sail) and in rivers and channels, even on city sidewalks. They seem to be based on these (potentially contradictory) reasons: 

When we car camp the night before a canoe-camping trip, we bring an extra comforter from home and put it on top of the Thermarests, under our sleeping bags. We also bring pillows. These combine to produce a luxurious sleep as far as we're concerned. I've also slept on my fair share of air mattresses, mostly in houses, and if they don't go flat they're fine. They shouldn't go flat - if they do, patch them. 

If being in air below 0C is not normal for you, the difference is probably caused by breathing through your mouth vs your nose. Where there is visible snow, it's colder than 0C. You can feel uncomfortable in your nose breathing in this cold. You won't actually get ice crystals forming in your nose, but you can feel that you are. Your reflex will be to breathe through your mouth more, even though it's safer in say -20C to breathe through your nose to warm the air and spare your lungs. (It doesn't matter at 0 how you breathe, 0 is not that cold.) Breathing through your mouth dries your mouth out. You descend a little, it's 1 or 2 (or even 5) degrees warmer, you relax, and you breathe through your nose again so you stop drying out the inside of your mouth. 

In the absence of training and practice, which I would posit is very rare, go with a quinzy instead. 

My mother swears by a combination wasp-repellant and sunscreen that she buys from Boots in England. I see they also carry wasp repellant alone, at $URL$ 

If you were a voyageur, among your most important equipment would be your fellow voyageurs and a larger boat so as to hold them all. Assuming you're a little more modern and have a 16 or so foot boat with two paddlers, you get upriver by: 

We had this whole beach to ourselves, there was no other site on it. The path near the sign leads to a clearing with good tent spots and a fire ring. 

In addition to heat and humidity, my shed exposes my possessions to cold and damp, and worst of all to outdoor animals such as squirrels, which like to nest in large hollow things (filling them with dead grass and other organics) or use them as food caches (pine cones primarily.) Anything with a fabric or stuffing component may be chewed by mice, squirrels etc if it doesn't get mouldy. So what can safely be stored outside under a not-entirely-waterproof roof, such as in a shed, and exposed to the full range of temperature variations and possible critter predations? 

Bring in as little plastic as you can. Pack your stuff in reusable containers. If something is plastic-wrapped or in a plastic bag, be a person who cares and don't let that plastic blow away or drop from your hand. Stick it in a pocket right away, and have a place to keep it so you can take it back out with you If you come across someone else's garbage, whether plastic, glass, tin or whatnot, take it out. Put it in the "place to keep it" - I use the garbage bag that backcountry parks issue you with your permit number written on it. (Usually I find nothing and I have no garbage of my own so the bag comes out empty. I keep it in my glove compartment and take it in on trips where one wasn't issued to me. It serves as a good visual reminder that it contains garbage, something that is highly unusual on my trips.) If you spot someone else's plastic from a distance, and can't safely get to it to clean it up, you also don't know anything about its chemistry, so there's nothing you can do. Console yourself with the fact you did numbers 1-3. If you come across a piece of plastic waste so large it's impossible for you to remove it, take a picture, ideally geotagged, and report it to the park people or landowner when you leave. If the land is entirely public, investigate to see if there's someone you can report to. For example a 1000L tank of dubious liquid is something you have to leave behind, but should still act on in some way. 

Plenty of places sell sleeping bag liners. Sometimes they are designed to make the bag warmer, other times to be more absorbent. For example, Mountain Equipment co-op sells quite a few, some of which are cotton and mention "absorbency" and "comfort" in their descriptions. I don't doubt that other suppliers offer them too. 

There is a LOT of stuff you only need one of. Pots and pans, stoves, firewood saw, first aid kit, repair kit, water treatment, binoculars, ... we either worked out in advance who would bring something, or moved things between packs before setting off. (And often, the family with less children had some shared stuff in the tent pack, too, like books for bedtime stories.) We also balanced out the food as it got eaten. For ease of finding things, one bag held snack foods (jerky, nuts) and an entirely different bag held meal ingredients. Knowing where to find things when 4 or more bags might hold it sounds like a nightmare to me. As the children got larger we had bags for them to carry, but could always clip those things to an adult pack if we needed to. In the same vein, a mixed-strength group should pack in a way that makes it easy to take something (the [whatever] kit, the rope bag) out of one person's pack and put it on someone else's. Remember, too, that you may start a trip as a matched group, then a minor injury or illness may afflict one of you, and splitting up the load may be the key to continuing. 

I would split your nutritional needs into long, medium, and short term. Things like Vitamin C and Vitamin A are long term. A week or two of being short on them will not cause you problems during the trip, nor afterwards when you return to your normal eating patterns. You can essentially ignore them, which is kind of a bummer because this would be the easiest shortcoming to fix, by taking a multivitamin or other supplements. Medium term would be fat and protein. Most people eat lots of protein - beef jerky, nuts in the trail mix, peanut butter - and get enough fat too. If for some reason you were eating meals like "pasta with butter but not cheese" and "white rice with vegetables" then perhaps you would run short of protein. (I say perhaps because grains do have some protein, and we typically need less than we think.) This would manifest itself mostly as feeling hungry too soon given the amount of work you're doing, and maybe not sleeping well. If it kept up long enough you might also be plagued with digestive problems. From reading books about long expeditions it seems to be a month of no fat and very little protein before dysentery sets in. Short term your big worry is fibre. If you're not eating any fruits or veggies, and you've taken white flour bread and pasta, white rice etc, and no legumes, then you might not be getting any fibre. Depending on your age this can make you feel very uncomnfortable in just a few days. Throw in a little dehydration because you're sweating and drinking water isn't always to hand, and you could be feeling very jammed up. The solution to fibre may be as close as your trail mix, if it's full of dried fruit. If you ignore the dried fruit, or if your trail mix is full of M&Ms, then you need to make sure you eat some vegetables. A dried soup mix might lead to nice lunches and take care of that for you, or you might try to cook more often. Or you could pay attention to those ads aimed at the 50+ crowd and bring along a fibre supplement - the kind you stir into water would probably be best. If your concern is "I feel healthy and strong, my body works fine during the trip, but am I setting myself up for a long term health problem with the occasional week of deprivation" I would unequivocally say you are not. A bags-of-chips-on-the-couch habit that lasts for years can do that; a week without enough fibre or Vitamin A will not. 

This one is about 6-8" long, costs $20 at Canadian Tire, and has met our needs for decades. We carry spare blades for it which I presume we bought at the same time. I think we snapped a blade once and replaced it on the spot. 

These days all the cool kids have Nalgene bottles that are clear and rigid. I wouldn't expect you could pour boiling water into those. The Nalgene website says they are made from Tritan. 

In my opinion, a pee jar is a terrible idea, especially with kids. It would just lead to pee all over the tent one way or another. Not wanting to go out in the cold to pee is a good motivator and if you don't get up in the night at home, you shouldn't have to get up in the night when you're camping. 

A free standing tent can be put up in a location that won't let you put pegs into the ground, such as on a rocky surface, because it establishes structure of its own and the pegs are just to keep it from blowing away. You can tie the tent to rocks or trees if pegs won't go into the ground. In a pinch, you can use rocks inside the tent to keep it down, or rely on your own weight. There are other benefits too. In 30 years of camping I've set up on solid rock maybe twice. But I can't count the number of times I've unpegged the wet tent, carried it somewhere sunnier than where I pitched it, and even rolled it on one side to expose the wet base to a breeze. I've also unpegged a tent that still had bedding in it, put it in a canoe, and moved it to another (very nearby) site and then pegged it back out again. If you plan to camp with small children, then you should enjoy being able to set up the tent in the least tent-peg-friendly location of all (and one where both rocks and trees are in remarkably short supply): your living room. Great place to practice setup and for the kids to practice sleeping in it. 

First, you won't need to make this observation if you routinely drink when you stop to rest, and if you eat something at least slightly salty whenever you snack (if your snacks include jerky or salted nuts you're more than covered.) Second, pay attention to your thirst. Many of us ignore our bodies for hours at a time - postponing bodily functions during a commute, a meeting, a lecture, the workday, a movie, and so on. If you're working outside in the heat you need to pay attention to the signals from your body. If you're utterly unable to tell whether you're thirsty or not, then develop a habit of drinking every 30 minutes or the like, but it's better to regain the ability to listen to those signals. Third, learn what your urine is usually like when you're clearly not dehydrated because you're at home in your normal environment. What colour is it? (Not "what colour does it turn the water in the toilet?") If it gets much darker and stronger smelling than normal, you may be dehydrated. If it still seems normal, you are drinking at the correct rate and can relax. Fourth, learn your own idiosyncrasies. My lips get chapped (even in the summer) if I am not drinking enough. If yours are the same, learn to recognize the sign and increase your fluids. Many people get a "dehydration headache" - if you're outdoors working hard and get a headache that comes on quickly, get a litre of liquid inside you before you take a painkiller. Everything I've seen and read (example from the CBC) suggests that electrolyte replacement is only necessary for elite athletes who are sweating profusely and not eating regular food while doing so, and only after several hours of that. If there is salt in your snack foods and your meals, you can ignore electrolyte replacement worries. 

From $URL$ There may not be a lifeguard in these areas, but there are no sudden drop-offs, dangerous currents, or similar known hazards. It may be a little crowded, depending on the park you choose, but you can get used to things that make swimming in a lake different from swimming in a pool - waves, walking on a bottom that may be sandy, muddy, or stony until you get to deep water, and vegetation brushing your foot and scaring you a little. You don't need to worry about sharks, jellyfish, sea urchins, or coral scrapes in Ontario water, only drowning. If you don't have a provincial park near you, investigate conservation areas - some are completely undeveloped, some have a beach and some amenities. Don't Google for "wild swimming" - that's not a common Canadian phrase. Google for "beach" or "swimming park" for better results. (Not that a swimming park is a thing, just that pages containing both words are likely to be about swimming in some kind of park.) We have some amazing beaches in Ontario but since it's bigger than many countries, you can't really ask for a list. Once you're used to lake swimming you can evaluate whether it's safe to swim in a particular lake, such as in the backcountry of Algonquin where there are no lines of floats to tell you where it is safe. Don't swim in rivers with a noticeable current until you have a lot of lake experience, and never do so alone unless you are wearing a PFD. 

I would not recommend camping alone if you have not camped before. There is quite a lot of multitasking - in a group of 4 adults often every single one works simultaneously for an hour or so when we reach a campsite - and you could find yourself trying to do things in the dark (which is dangerous) or when you're too hungry to think straight. Next thing you know you've tripped over something and sprained an ankle, or burned yourself, and you don't have any help. Make sure you're capable of putting up your tent and that you know how long it takes. Make sure you're capable of lighting your stove. (You can practice these in the backyard or possibly in a park, though you might get a visit from someone who thinks you're trying to actually camp and tells you to move on.) Make sure you stop early enough each day to do everything that has to be done before dark. When planning your route, take into account that you may walk more slowly (carrying a heavier load) or need more trips across portages. You may also just stop to stare from a lookout, or to watch some wildlife, or various things that you wouldn't do if you were with someone. You should know what order things have to be done: unrolling your sleeping pad and bag and getting your flashlight out of the pack can wait until after you've made dinner, but getting a tarp up to protect from the rain that's coming probably can't. Also, imagine you're canoeing with a partner and you suddenly need to pee. You and your partner paddle to shore, you jump out and go as far inland as water protection and privacy require, then you come back. 5 minutes. But if you're alone, you'll need to find a place where you can tie up the canoe and leave it unattended without having it tipped by waves or washed away. Maybe pull it up on shore a bit. You'll need to dig out some rope to tie it to a tree. This all takes time. Same when you're at a campsite, you can't just pop out to gather some wood for a fire, you have to secure the campsite (at least to stop stuff blowing away) and pick up the things you need to take with you (cell phone, emergency kit) rather than just coming and going as you please and yelling for help if you need it. Most people who go camping suffer nothing worse than blisters and sunburn. I find that if people are going to get hurt more seriously, it's when they're tired, hungry, grumpy from their blisters and sunburn, or when it's dark. Going alone significantly raises the chances of all those things. So allow more time, and look after yourself. 

I've carried them out, and I've burned them in the nightly fires we were having anyway. This was canoe-camping rather than hiking, so weight was less of an issue - but a weeklong trip accumulating diapers from two toddlers: smell was a problem. We used a dedicated bag for them, and kept it well away from everything else at campsites. Bags within bags within bags helped a bit too. My preference would be to burn them (start the fire while dinner is being made on a stove; once it's going deal with the diapers you've accumulated that day; after the diapers are burned put on another log and declare the fire open for sitting around) but when you're camping during a burn ban you do what you have to.
