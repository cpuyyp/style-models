¿How do you tell if a person is vegetarian? Test the microbiota. The population of microbies in the gut is a function of diet, drug treatments, etc.(See, for instance, this article.) The procedure would only require a stool sample, from where the DNA would be extracted and analysed. Given the volumes you have to process, the whole procedure can be fully automated. The lab machines can fit in a few large rooms scattered around the city, and the data would be sent to central supercomputers (probably the most expensive part). Bottlenecks are easily dealt with, the samples can be stored frozen for very long periods of time, and you actually need very little material to perform the actual experiment. Note that you cannot fool this method by just eating some meat before getting tested, you actually have to incorporate it in your diet to affect the bacteria population. You are actually testing the person's lifestyle, not their last meal. As a bonus, for the same cost, you can make a good sampling of the population's health and catch early most of the colon cancers and other gut diseases. (If you are interested in this approach, I can add more the details.) 

This person legal status, for all practical purposes, will be pretty much like an illegal immigrant in your country. He has no papers, no official recognition; and he shouldn't make the authorities aware he is there. His only advantage is that his accent is probably indistinguishable from the locals, so people will likely think a priori that he is a citizen. Enrolling at the University is out of the question, as it requires ID and money. But that doesn't mean he cannot pretend to be a student, attend lectures, study on his own, and take on mini jobs targeted for college students. These are commonly unofficial, so he won't need documents nor leave a paper trail. Again, people won¡t think he is an illegal alien, so they won't get suspicious when he doesn't provide official papers. He won't be able to take exams, but he can make up a backstory saying he comes from a very poor family that cannot afford tuition (if there is such a thing in your country), but he is there for the knowledge. 

Proteins are the smallest machines of the cell that can do anything interesting (for some definition of interesting, but I work with proteins and I am biased). They are long chains of hundreds of aminoacids (thousands of atoms) do things like pumping water, nutrients, and waste in and out of the cells, guide chemical reactions, send signals, etc. One of the tools to study them are molecular dynamics simulations. They pretty much use classical mechanics (replacing the atoms with a fancy version of soft balls) with minor numerical tweaks to reproduce quantum behaviour to a very accurate degree. The tweaks are mostly to avoid having to solve the full electrostatic problem of where are the electrons at each time step; but nothing of that would seem strange to a microscopical individual. So, to get generally quantum-weird behaviour you have to go smaller than the basic functional unit of the life as we know it. 

There was once an australopithecine called Paranthropus Robustus. It was slightly smaller than the reigning hominid at the time, and was driven extinct by habitat loss. Had it survived, and had evolutionary growth similar to hominids, the creature would be slightly smaller than modern humans. Seeing as Paranthropus was a herbivore, it wouldn't be able to obtain the large amount of brain fat necessary to compete with humans. Thusly, it would likely evolve a larger stature and become an expert at hiding from humans, who had vastly superior technology. These adaptations would have all taken place by the middle ages. Considering the areas where these beings live (according to mythology) are not the ones containing the most technologically advanced humans at this point, it would have a perfect place to live without too many consequences if they were found. Interestingly, these places are still fairly to extremely isolated, so the only humans they would have contact with are lone backpackers. It would be interesting to see the instinctive behaviors of this species (e.g. avoiding certain areas like hiking trails, specific caves, parts of Mount Everest.) 

In your universe, people can move planets. By nature of this being possible, you can build some AWESOME weapons. One I would suggest is the "planetary nutcracker" concept, where you move two planets on the opposite sides of a fleet or planet, and launch them towards each other. Given the size of the ships involved, and that they use fusion as power, the bombers themselves are effective weapons. You might be better off shooting a gutted one of those at the enemy. 

Consider this. A talisman is not an object in the way that a pocketwatch is an object. The talisman is both an object and a "feel". A person can have a "feel" for making talismans, but this person would have no "feel" for anything else. The talisman-maker would not make talismans by enchanting any random object, the talisman-maker would instead, for instance, make a fire talisman by burning rowan wood and pouring the ashes into a hollow ring with a stone of obsidan. The mage in question would be able to make as many talismans as necessary, but would have to own the required ingredients for a spell, AND have a "feel" for talisman-making. Unlike spells, talismans would be reusable, and the magic would never decay. An interesting possibility for this would be to have an ancient, utopian civilization that existed for thousands of years before falling to conquering outsiders. During their reign, they made some of the most powerful talismans the world ever has or will see. If these include time or mind control talismans, they will be sought after by every person in your world. 

I can answer that! Well...kinda, I can give some ideas. As you might remember from school, plants are green because of chlorophyll, a substance plants use to absorb sunlight to make food. It's green because the most intense color light emitted by Sol is green; if they take in too much at once, then it basically hurts the plant. So green plants are the most efficient at absorbing light from a G-class star. Other such chemical compounds have colors like orange, red, yellow, even purple. These are less efficient than chlorophyll, but they're good for fallback options. These might be better, tho, around other types of stars. Which ones would work best where, I dunno, but it's safe to mention that dimmer stars will, in general, tend to have darker plants. Imagine forests of black trees facing a red dwarf star, absorbing all the light it can...

I'd say it depends on the climate. Remember, Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Sapiens were able to coexist on the same planet for a long time before climate change forced/allowed the two groups to come into contact with one another. I suspect that, were it still an Ice Age, we'd still be at least able to live together. Another possibility lies in a civilization from the old game Star Control 2: The Zoq-Fot-Pik. (Bear with me here, this is an old game, and some of its ideas are a bit...eccentric.) 

Let me preface this by saying that, as a mortal, non-omnipotent being, I cannot know all outcomes. I will do my best to answer with what I as Worldbuilder think may happen, but keep in mind that what I say doesn't have to apply to your world. In other words, take what's I say with a grain of rice, and feel free to use your own interpretation. . In regards to your queries, let's first take a look at your world, and compare it to our own Earth/Moon System. Luna is approximately 27% the size of earth, and at its furthest is about 405,000km distant. This translates to about 1.985 x 10^26 N of gravitational force between the two objects. Jeah, on the other hand, is about 14.5% the size of Paveiah, yet is only 17,000 km from its parent body. Considering the size ratio between parent body and Moon, your moon and planet have a size ratio half as much as the ratio between Earth and Luna, yet is also 27x closer. This translates to around 1.857 x 10^26 N of force. . Given the calculations above, here are my conclusions.
