For an analogy: Imagine that your entire life is spent in a large box with a single window looking out. Outside this window, all you ever see is a uniform, but pleasant, shade of mauve. This uniform mauve seems to extend in all directions, at least as best as you can determine by moving about in your box and using any tools that you have to try and improve your view. 

In order for a soul to exist past bodily death (without invoking magic, per the first assumption), the soul would need to exist as some combination of forces, matter and/or energy so it can drive our bodies while we're alive (second & third assumptions) AND not rely on those same physical bodies so they may continue to exist postmortem (fourth assumption). Things that affect matter (such as our material bodies) are called forces. Therefore, souls must be able to exert some kind of force on our bodies while we are alive. Any soul-force candidates can then be evaluated to see if the associated energy can persist in some meaningful way after we die (per the fourth assumption, the soul would not become a completely different fundamental force after dying). We know of four fundamental forces: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electromagnetism and gravity. Since there are only four we can fairly quickly examine each as candidate carriers of the 'soul force' to see if any could support the existence of an external, post-death soul. (Again: with no force there's nothing that a soul can do to or for us while we're alive.) 

* These are: Gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. If there are other forces at play, they are either infinitesimally weak or operate on infinitesimally short distances. ** We've gotten very good at detecting forces and particles that have nearly zero interaction with matter. For example: Neutrinos have so near to zero interaction with physical matter that trillions can pass through your body every second undetected - and are studied regularly and in detail. 

1 When debating creationists, this strategy is known as the 'Gish Gallop'. Note that, while professional creationist debaters may do this deliberately, the average theist who stumbles on this strategy usually doesn't realize that they wield misinformation against you. 2 One of my favourite creationist/ID arguments will forever be the one about the "apparent design" of the avian pulmonary system, largely because I learned some pretty cool stuff about birds and early theropod dinosaurs researching a rebuttal. 

I don't think 'morality' of actions is a simple boolean 'Yes/No' value, and different moral frameworks could give different values to each of the actions. That said, with the attempt at keeping moral assumptions to a minimum (i.e.: "Murder is wrong"): Scenario 1 ("Pre-Edit" scenario) I disagree that one situation would be moral and the other would not. I would argue that both killings were immoral, though not necessarily equally immoral. In the second situation (killing a 'Mad Bomber'), you still snuff out a human life. A more moral resolution would be to non-lethally apprehend the bomber before the Earth-Shattering Kaboom. (Successfully rehabilitating the bomber afterwards would be more moral still.) Scenario 2 ("Post-Edit" scenario) Again, trying to keep the moral assumptions to a minimum, both actors in this scenario have behaved immorally. A non-lethal resolution to the crisis would again be the most moral outcome. Enacting vigilante violence would be immoral, but possibly justifiable in light of the bomb exploding being the worst outcome. The intent of the killer and the moral framework we choose to work under might modify the exact 'numerical value' we assign to the deed, but the morality of the act should fall in the range of: {0 > Homicide â‰¥ Mass Homicide} regardless of the particulars. When faced with a situation where you must choose between two evils, choosing the lesser evil may be more moral than choosing the greater... but you're still choosing evil. 

In biology, 'Fitness' is a complicated, multi-parameter, interconnected mish-mash that is constantly being re-evaluated in response to an ever-changing environment that includes flora, fauna, seasons, social/sexual dimensions, etc. etc. etc. Using everyday definitions of the words, 'Survival of the fittest' is to biology as 'Things fall down' is to physics. </rant> 

One additional interesting facet to consider, and apologies if I missed it in the earlier answers, comes from looking at the sum total of energy in the observable universe. As far as we've been able to measure so far, all the positive energy sources in the universe (positive electrical charges, mass, etc.) are exactly cancelled out by their equivalent negative energy source (negative electrical charges, gravity, etc.). If the nature of the universe is such that the sum total of all energy actually IS exactly zero, we have the fascinating situation where the universe is, in a sense, 'nothing' - at least in the manner of: Further support for this idea comes from physicists who are studying 'virtual particles'. It turns out that a pure vacuum is unstable, and 'virtual particles' can appear out of 'nothing' for a brief moment of time before re-combining and cancelling each other out again: a Nothing -> Something -> Nothing progression of the form: 0 = 1 - 1 = 0 In short, one of the unexpected answers to the ancient question is that, just maybe: ... Meaning once again, the universe appears to be turning our intuitions on their head: the 'something' that we see might actually be an expression of 'nothing'! 

Are humans artifacts? Short answer: No. Longer Answer: UPDATED ANSWER FROM THE COMMENTS To say that you are a creation of your parents, and then go on to describe how a table or a cabinet is created by a designer/maker, would be to change the meaning of 'create' partway through. If I push a snowball off a mountain, it may or may not gather speed and pick up snow to become a cartoonishly huge boulder by the time it reaches the bottom. Regardless of what happens, I haven't 'created' anything in the usual sense, even though I initiated the series of events that led to the formation of the giant snowball. Similar for having sex - kicking off the chain of chemical reactions that results in a new human being, whether by accident or by intent, is categorically different from deliberately making something for a specific purpose. Also, coming back around to your original definition, artifacts need to meet at least three criteria: An artifact is an objectThat has been intentionally madeFor a certain purpose[1]: Are humans objects? Under normal circumstances, 'object' would refer to something inanimate, so I would say no.[2]: Can a human be intentionally made? Perhaps: While I would say no, this point is the most open to quibbling. However, if any one of these three criteria fail, humans cannot be classed as artifacts, so let's move on. [3]: Can a human be made for a certain purpose? Here I would say no - human beings get to define their purpose, they don't have to accept an imposed purpose. There's a reason we cheer for the Rebellion taking on the Empire, after all. Since humans fail to meet all criteria by most interpretations, and at minimum fail to meet criteria [3], we are in no danger of being artifacts. 

There is absolutely no guarantee that anything devised by human minds or hands will survive the eventual extinction of the human race. That's the short answer - there's a myriad number of ways and reasons by which our species may be wiped out. Our current numbers and distribution may seem impressive, but the hubris of our species is vulnerable to medium-sized rocks in unstable orbits, emergence of devastating and virulent new diseases, climate destabilization and the resultant loss/reduction of human-habitable areas, etc. etc. I mention this because the 'how' behind our eventual extinction will affect what artifacts are left behind and how they might be interpreted. Based on previous questions, it is my understanding that the question-poser holds the view that H. sapiens (sapiens) will be superseded by some form of meta-humanity of our own devising. While possible, this outcome is not guaranteed and is of unknown likelihood, but will be considered below. Extinction due to cruel, cosmic coincidence If H. sapiens' death knell comes about due to some form of Death from the Skies, most other species on our fair planet would suffer significant setbacks as well. 65 million years passed between the K-T extinction event and the advent of modern humans, and because human-like intelligence has happened only once so far we have no idea if that's fast or slow. A few million years would probably be an optimistic waiting time. For comparison, time has not been especially kind to human achievements over the past few thousand years - 5000-year-old cities tend to be completely buried. So with that future in mind: Gaining, transmitting and storing knowledge would have to be reinvented. Note that, since we have no idea how likely the emergence of human-like intelligence is, there is no guarantee that such would arise for a second time on the same planet. There already exist non-human (and even non-mammal) tool-using and tool-crafting species, though humans have certainly elevated tool creation to an art form. Since tool use has arisen spontaneously multiple times in multiple lineages, it does not seem unreasonable to predict that a species with sufficiently human-like intelligence would develop more and more complicated tools similar to how we did. Artifacts of humanity's brief tenure on this planet would be left behind. Should some future species develop sufficiently human-like intellect to invent their own version of archaeology there would be a lot of interesting stuff for them to dig up, interpret and argue about in their equivalent of academia halls. Due to the passage of geologic-scale time, it would be unlikely that anything we've made would still be functional enough to be reverse engineered.A codified morality would have to be reinvented, and would be contingent on the emergence of a species with sufficiently human-like intelligence. That said, should such intelligence arise the development of some form of morality is probably a given, since most (if not all) social species have some way to reward/punish acceptable/deviant behaviours. There's no way to know how similar their morality would be to any of the various moral systems devised by humanity (though there may be sociologists/anthropologists/biologists/etc. who specialize in this area who may be able to make some educated guesses)Artistic creations that left physical artifacts may be preserved well enough to be rediscovered in the ruins of our civilization. Whether they would be appreciated as art by the future species is unknowable. It is extremely unlikely that any of our writings would ever be deciphered (deciphering extinct human languages is hard enough, with some of the earliest written languages still indecipherable!), so any meaning behind the art would be lost. Any of our digitally-encoded knowledge would likely be long decayed by the time computer-like technology could be reinvented.The assorted religious values expressed by various H. sapiens groups throughout history would only be recoverable if the scientist/linguist equivalents of the future species could crack one or more of our written languages and have sufficient surviving source material to work from. It is far more likely that the future species would develop their own unique superstitions, beliefs, cults, etc. Extinction due to natural disasters (disease, habitat devastation, nuclear war, zombie outbreak, etc) If our species is taken out by some event(s) more local to our planet, we might go down without taking 90% of all extant species along with us. Earth's fauna might be in a position to adapt to our abandoned infrastructure, so the re-evolution of human-like intelligence may be faster the second time, maybe as fast as hundreds (or even tens) of thousands of years. Gaining and storing knowledge would still have to be re-invented, but the artifacts left behind by H. sapiens might be salvageable enough to serve as exemplars. Written works would probably not be decipherable (as above), but physical ruins would provide lots of ideas to reverse-engineer.Assuming that extant tool-using and tool-crafting species survive the H. sapiens extinction event, their crafting efforts may get a boost from the materials we abandon. The exact nature of our extinction would determine the quantity and quality of material artifacts left behind.Morals would have to be re-invented, as above.Human art would still lose its modern meaning, as above. Human religious values would be lost, as above. H. sapiens bring about their own extinction through creation of sapient robotics, superhumans, or other 'transcendent' non-carbon-based life form In this scenario, human extinction is a planned event because we've created something better and are stepping aside and letting our creations take over (or we accidentally create the robo-apocalypse that Hollywood loves and we get wiped out forcefully, save for one plucky hero and heroine. But I digress). There is currently no reason to think that we're anywhere close to creating a trans-human species. There may also be technical considerations that would prevent us from creating such a species (at least as commonly envisioned). That said, if we can and eventually do, human achievement at that time would be the starting point that the new species would work from. Gaining, storing and transmitting knowledge would continue to follow much the same pattern as it has through human history. The robo-species would undoubtedly be intelligently designed to use other human technology, and would be able to craft new and novel items.Morality would continue to evolve, using the programming by their creators as a starting point. The physical realities of a trans-human species might radically shift the nature of moral considerations - if a trans-human can have a complete backup of their mental state made at any time, death might only be an inconvenience, for example. Artistic works would still be recognizable, being grounded in the human programmers' tastes initially, and if the trans-human species has senses beyond what H. sapiens possesses their artistic expression could evolve along very unexpected lines. Religious values would initially be whatever was programmed into the trans-humans and would evolve from there. If all trans-humans have instant, inbuilt, internet-like access to all human and trans-human knowledge at all times I would predict that religion would quickly fade to near-nonexistence in trans-human societies (based on studies that correlate education to religiosity in human populations).
