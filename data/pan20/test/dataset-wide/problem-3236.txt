In 1941, when the Germans were slicing through most Soviet tank formations of BTs and T-26s, the T-34 was a shock. With a better gun and armor than the German dedicated anti-tank tank, the Panzer III, a well positioned T-34 could hold up many times their number. 

Eliminating the distinctive white dome would be only one part of a camouflage plan. It's a big and delicate job and has to be done in advance. All other elements of the camouflage plan can be done when there is an air raid alert, but they're worthless if there's a big white dome showing. First thing to realize is the world looks very different at 15,000 feet (where high level bombers operate) and you're getting shot at and you're trying to navigate based on bad maps and a few aerial photos. WWII pilots would mostly be piloting on compass bearings and terrain features. It's not necessary to completely cover something to throw bombers off the target, just to make it look like something else. Take a look. Second is that a site like the Taj Mahal would be camouflaged by multiple means. I'm speculating here based on how other sites were camouflaged. Large smoke generators would send streaks of smoke covering the area obscuring and breaking up the regular lines of the plaza and surrounding gardens. Strips of dark cloth could be laid across the stone to further break up the distinctiveness of the site. The British in WWII got so devious with their camouflage, I wouldn't be surprised if they put a decoy dome at some other bend in the river. Frankly, the biggest problem with the whole thing is that bend in the river makes the target very easy to find from the air. 

Paradox generally does a good job on their history, for a video game, and I'd be surprised if they made an elementary mistake. Whoops, Total War is by Creative Assembly. Don't know their rep for historical accuracy. The basic phalanx, soldiers in a tight, rectangular formation moving forward as a unit, usually with polearm and shield, was around for millennia by the late Egyptian period. The earliest depiction is in the Stele of the Vultures celebrating a victory of Lagash over its neighbor Umma around 2500 BC. 

I'm going to stretch "magic" and "army" a bit to gather in some of the more well documented modern examples. 

Yes, but... It wasn't exactly a treasure ship. Not like the treasure ships that would come later. It was more of a down-payment-on-a-bribe ship. The story the OP and their video tells got a little smashed together and mixed up sending a ship back to Spain with scuttling his ships. Instead I'll draw on The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz, an eyewitness account by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, one of Cortés's men. It goes something like this. Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar is made Governor of Cuba under Diego Columbus. Veláquez and the settlers don't like being under Diego Columbus, so they form a Cabilo which directly answers to the King of Spain and put Velázquez in charge. Velázquez is now free to do basically whatever he wants. Velázquez starts chartering expeditions to Mexico. In 1518 it's Cortés's turn and he rapidly builds a large expedition. Velázquez gets jealous and fearful that Cortés will take what he finds for himself, Cortés was also dating his sister-in-law which didn't help, and revokes Cortés charter. Cortés sails anyway, committing mutiny punishable by death. Cortés stomps around on the Yucatán peninsula a bit shaking down the natives for whatever valuables he could, but not finding enough to excuse his crime. Hearing about the Aztec Empire, and thinking its conquest is his ticket out of a death sentence, he founds/conquerors Veracruz in May 1519 as a base of supply for his coming conquest, and also for a ticket out of his legal jam. Taking a page from Velázquez, Cortés has a Cabilo declares himself governor of Veracruz. Now he's, theoretically, acting under the authority of the King. But the King hasn't authorized this. So Cortés sends a ship back to Cuba with whatever valuables he has and some trusted men to ask/bribe the King to make his governorship legit. Since this was before Cortés's conquest of the Aztec Empire, there was little treasure and everyone had to empty their pockets for the gift to the King. 

Source: Wikipedia It was becoming increasingly apparent that ranges of 10 to 300 meters were the norm in battle and short range firepower was what mattered. In a war still being fought with bolt action rifles designed for aimed fire at ludicrously optimistic ranges (2000+ meters), the Soviets were arming whole companies with cheap submachine guns to close with and chop up the enemy. 

The Germany army of 1939 to 1941 was something of a bluff. It was still primarily horse drawn. Most of its tanks were woefully undergunned and underarmored, the Panzer I and Panzer II. Their infantry mostly used bolt-action rifles of WWI vintage. What it did have going for it was an incredible ability to react to changing situations at a pace no other army could. They used this defensively, responding to enemy movements and attacks, and offensively by making sudden, concentrated attacks where the enemy did not expect them. By the time the enemy reacted, the situation had already changed. The key elements of early German victory were the radio, unlike other armies every tank had one, tactical air support, massed armor, and an amazing general staff. Their forces could bring down a lot of concentrated hurt faster than the enemy could react. Germany won the Battle Of France, in part, because they outmaneuvered the Allies, but also because it was over so fast. The Germans and the Allies fought the Battle of France with what they had available in those six weeks, that means not just material, but also tactics. The Allies could not match the new German pace of war, and the French lost half their army and surrendered the other half. Germany hoped to do the same by attacking the Soviet Union, and they nearly did, but the scale was so much larger than France both in terms of sheer size of territory to be conquered, the people to be conquered, and the size of the Soviet Army (which the Germans underestimated). Though they gained local superiority in the initial attack, a German specialty, overall they were fighting an army twice their size. And they'd have to do it on a 3000 km continuous front, while also fighting in North Africa, garrisoning Norway, France, the Balkans, and fighting the Battle of the Atlantic. To say they stretched themselves a bit thin is an understatement. The more they fought, the weaker they got. 

Field Archery Competitions We can look at the rules of International Field Archery for their expectations. Certain Field Archery competitions are closer to what you'd experience in combat, in particular "IFAA 3-D Hunting" uses animal sized targets placed at unmarked distances. The archer does not know how far away the target is. The maximum distance a target can be placed is 60 meters. This target is 23cm x 37cm wide approximating a man sized target. Similarly, in the "Hunter Round", the maximum distance is 70m but firing at a 65cm target, twice the width of a man. Man-sized 35cm targets are fired at from ~30m. The International Field Archery Association has a "Historical Bows" category which defines them as "based on the accepted design and usage during the period preceding the year 1900". They make no change to the targets for historical bow competition. The effect of historical vs modern bows can be seen in the 2014 Tournament Results. The best scores with historical bows (AFHB and AMHB, Adult Male/Female Historical Bow) are routinely lower than the worst scores with modern bows. This could reflect the inaccuracy of historical bows, or it could reflect the smaller talent pool of historical bowman. 

Putting aside the danger for this to turn into "it was better in my day" rants, Hacker Culture is alive and well and thriving. It just doesn't look like it did in the 70s. First, I'm going to make a modification to your definition. You define Hacker Culture as "being really good at something for its own sake" which was never really true. You could be good at it for practical reasons, for bragging rights, for personal satisfaction... a hacker could be defined as a person who is good at something because they want to be good at it not because they need to or are told to be. It's not their job or their training. They didn't learn it in school. It's not their parent's job. Hackers are almost compelled to hack. Hackers are self-motivated to learn about their field. Furthermore, Hackers are not just good at something, they tend to dive deep into their craft to pull it apart and reassemble it in interesting ways. Hackers won't accept conventional wisdom about how it's supposed to be done, they will explore the space themselves. Musicians who play their instrument in a novel way I would consider Hackers. What has Hacker culture become? The DIY movement and the DIY Ethic. Maker spaces, Open Source programming, craft brewing, urban farming, home cooking, bike repair, self-publishing, blogging, knitting... these are all movements which rely on individual's compulsion to take a personal interest of the objects (physical or virtual) which make up their daily lives. To learn how to make, use, repair and improve on all the stuff which would normally be purchased. The big shift in Hacker Culture has been an increased freedom of information brought on by ubiquitous Internet access. Until the late 90s, you either had to figure it out on your own, know someone who knew how to Hack, or be lucky enough to stumble on a zine or small press book. Hacking worked much like a medieval guild. Hacking knowledge was handed down and passed around. It was arcane, jargon laden, and often wrong. The notion of Hackers as "Wizards" conveys the value and power of knowledge in pre-Internet Hacker culture, but it also conveys the secrecy. Ubiquitous and easy Internet access means now anyone can have access to the same information if they want it. It can be discussed, trialed, debunked, confirmed... all in publicly available archives. The rise of video blogging means information and tutorials are even more accessible. In the last ten years there has been a concerted effort to de-jargonize hacking, to remove the barriers to entry by making it easier to learn without dumbing down the actual information. Sites such as Instructables exemplify this exchange of information. 

Eventually the rules of US Citizenship would be defined by law, the first of which being the Naturalization Act of 1790 defining how to become a naturalized citizen. This was allowed by Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, but Congress had to define the rules. 

I'm sure if you poke around you can find plenty more. There is plenty of footage of kamikaze attacks available to watch. Many attack from a dive, but many attack level or in a shallow dive. What I take away from it is the pilots are lucky to hit the ship at all, precision isn't possible for barely trained pilots under intense fire. 

When I look at what the shipping miracles the Allies managed during WWII, such as the Persian Corridor, I'm inclined to say yes, they would have made it work somehow. Even had Operation FS been a success, there was still a supply line from the US west coast to Victoria (SE Australia). Ships would have to take an increasingly southern route to avoid Japanese controlled waters. The normal 28 day journey would stretch out and strain Allied shipping already pushed to its limit. 

The second statement, that Spain was overlooked, is flatly not true as will be demonstrated once we look at the text of the agreements and the historical arguing about what to do with Spain. The question of whether Spain counted as an Axis satellite state is one which was hotly debated in 1944 and 1945. This is the crux of the question. What The Yalta Agreement Said "Axis satellite state" is mentioned in the "Protocol Of Proceedings Of Crimea Conference", aka the Yalta Agreement, but it's never defined. 

With all that in mind, what happens when the German navy attempts to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar with submarines augmented with e-boats, destroyers and other light surface ships. To give it the best chance of succeeding, let's set it in the late summer of 1940 at the height of the Battle of Britain. The RAF is overstretched, the US hasn't entered the war, and ASW aircraft don't have radar capable of detecting submarine periscopes. The German navy at this point is in bad shape. Never anything like a match for the Royal Navy, the war had started a few years too soon and naval production schedules were thrown into chaos. They had just taken a mauling in the otherwise wildly successful invasion of Norway losing many small ships. At this point Germany only had 9 destroyers. They started the war with only 21, had since lost 12, and had only since commissioned one. They wouldn't last long with the major Royal Navy base of Gibraltar right there. It's unlikely Germany would risk its remaining overworked 9 destroyers on such a risky mission as blockading the Strait. The Germans had E-boats, small, fast, expendable torpedo boats, and in some quantity. And, like a submarine, they were also extremely vulnerable to any real warship. Their short range precludes them from being used in this operation. Spain is staunchly neutral, and the south of France and Morocco are Vichy French territory who can still deny the Germans from using their ports. While smaller ships have a hope of dodging the Royal Navy, larger surface vessels would be target practice. No German capital ship would risk staying in one area long enough for the RN to find them. So no support from the German surface navy. What about submarines? At this point in the war, the Germans had only commissioned 25 Type VII submarines of which only 13 remained. Their larger, ocean-going Type IX was too precious to be used in such an operation. At this point they had commissioned 11 but only 4 were left. It wasn't until 1941 that production would ramp up into the hundreds we think about when we think about the U-Boat war, but by then they were losing their technological edge. This pitifully small number of capable submarines meant not only would the blockade be difficult to maintain, but submarines would have to be taken from the then very successful Battle of the Atlantic probably never to return. Already, even in the summer of 1940, U-Boats were taking very heavy loses. And this was while mostly avoiding the Royal Navy. You're proposing they take them head on. Let's see what happens.
