In this example, you can see the power of each language : COBOL is extremely efficient for managing fixed datas, but if you need more, you're blocked. C# is more verbose but allows far more tasks to be done thanks to real language. I could easily add more controls to the JerseyNumber setter. Which I can't do ith the Level 88. 

I'll speak only for France. Here, internships are very structured. It's nigh-on impossible to find one without the proper papers from your school. While some firms(usually the big ones) will be happy to have an american intern, they'll be looking for someone with sellable experience. At your age, it's probably too early for that. Anyways, you can try your luck, but aim for big firms with an international surface, and be sure to have youe school in the process. And be prepared to have quite a number of rejections. You need only one success, after all. And as you are in the software industry, be warned that in France, 80% of the jobs are within consulting firms, called SSII or ESN. The big boys of the market should be your primary targets : Here is the top 10 in 2014 There are very few places in software vendors, and even less in other firms : I've seen several interns paid by the SSII working for other firms(especially banks). They are your best chance. But they usually recruit 22-years old interns nearing graduation, not 18-years old. 

Frankly, automating GUI tests for new features even before they are fully stable(not only in terms of "the program is stable", but also in terms "the functionalities & the workflow are stable") is, and always be, a waste of time. Plus, manual tester make often great spec writers for automated test writers as myself. EDIT : said otherwise : manual tests will always be needed to stick with the new evolutions, especially GUI tests. 

Ask HR wether they have a cooptation system. It's rather common, in companies who need a lot of developpers. You might even get little money for that. Also ask your friend wether he's interested, and if yes, only then, connect both. EDIT after comment : Be sure to respect the internal process for connecting both. CVs runnning in mails between different people are not a good thing. A CV placed in the right spot through the right process is a huge gain of time for everyone. The more you risk is that your friend is seen as unfit, ans his CV does not pass through. Not a real problem. 

Point 2 is especially important, and changes somewhat my point of view on the topic. It means he cannot work as others do. You don't discipline an artist, basically. You leave him place to express himself - if you have this place. You need to feed him with more difficult tasks, but also tasks that can afford to be late if he's not in the mood that day. Overall, at the end of the week, he'll have done far more things(and far more complex) than others. Others, though, will have done things that are time-critical. Of course, the thing is : do you have such tasks? If not, maybe such a high potential worker is not suited to this team. If you"ve got challenging tasks, OTOH, dump them on him : he'll love them. And it's also easier for others to accept a worker with a different schedules if he's doing other tasks. It's only a partial answer to point 1, but still. 

In France, we would say the work council is over zealous. Seems like employees perks are directly manged by the HR in your country, but the result is the same : they have a budget, and they spend it on your name without your authorization. As the HR is a direct arm for the uper management, and not elected as our work council, you have to be more subtle than simply protesting(I won't vote for you is an efficient lever - unfortunately you don't have it). You have to convince them it is in their best interest to keep from opening those accounts. Like "it gives our firm a bad image", "it's sad to waste money on products I'm not going to use", etc..... Don't speak about your own interest, or only as a secondary point. It's not their problem. Their problem is to protect the firm from the employees. Tell them it's not good for the firm. 

The point 2 is the one you have to be proud of, and sell. Sell during 1-1, Sell during yearly evaluations, or even later sell when you'll look for another job. You are a lead. It means your role is not only to do your job, but to have others behind you, and raising them up as much as possible. Be sure to ask for a compensation for that, but be grateful to the copiers. Imitation is the sweetest form of flattery. Make sure that flattery comes to your management's ears. 

Is the job done? I mean, wether the person looks like working or not should not be relevant. Performance should be relevant. If that worker makes more stuff than others, where is the problem? This person works another way than the average. Is probably not able to stay focused as much as its colleagues. Is able to make the job anyways. Well, then it's time to use that person the way it works. Not all workers are similar. Some need a lot of sweat to get things done. Others need a lot of pause time to get things done. That being said, there i one situation in which those people can be a problem : it's when jealousy arises, and the whole team spirit falls down. It does not happen often, to my experience, but it may happen. In this case, strict measures shall be taken. But in other cases, why do you want to get rid of someone more productive than his colleagues? EDIT : from your Edit, I understand that you've got 2 objectives : 

At best, it's a risky move. Less risky, because it's easier to fire people in India, but still. Training him is gonna cost you a lot of money, and if you have to fire him later, it's definitively lost money. It's also lost time, but as you had no good candidate, I'd say the time would have been lost anyways. Now the question to ask yourself is : "how to find better-suited candidates?" Answer can be on several levels. First thing is to make the job more appealing(though it's completely firm-dependant, so I won't enter details here). Second thing it to go fishing in other waters. Have you tried your country's best universities? Or the professional salons of your domain of activity? Third thing is to try to target specific people, with tools like linkedin(if it's not common in India, try to find an equivalent). Because the real problem is not that you took a risk with the less horrible candidate. The real problem is that you had only horrible candidates. 

While I totally agree with Thomas Owens & 17 of 26's answers, they just say this part of the answer : this is a bad move if you want to stay in the technical aspect of code. If, OTOH, you'd like to try yourself in management, this is an opportunity to take. While the situation is not perfect, it gives you an edge against "true" developers when it comes to management training, and a soft way. Be sure, however, to check that your company has positions in management, that those positions know some turnover, and make sure to work your politics. Without all this, you don't have future in management in this company, and therefore, stopping to code is just a bad move. 

Good answers from others, but I'd like to point out somethhing else that seems important to me : passing interviews is a skill. Which means that even if you have no chance to get the job(and that's not even sure right now), go anyways, and practice your interview passing skills. Try to convince, watch for the reactions, and check your level of stress. The more interviews you'll do, the better you'll manage your stress, and other tricky questions. Remember that opportunities to train this skill are scarce. Therefore, enjoy the opportunity you have. And you might maybe even get the job as a superbonus. Not likely, from what you say, but not impossible either. 

Some firms, and not always the smaller ones, or the less reputed ones, have as a doctrine to use interns as much as possible to reduce costs. You may think it works well, or not. But some firms really work like that. This firm, obviously, belongs to that category. Which means they never planned to pay you, and expected you to make a good job for nothing in exchange. If you cannot afford an unpaid internship, then it's a good thing they turned down your offer. There are other firms with other, more intern-friendly policies. Just, it's not something you know until you actually have an interview with them - or have a chat with people who already have the information. 

Did an incredible job _ saved und more than 1 full FTE in maintenance definitively. We don't want him anymore. Was troublesome. 

Happens. Here we have the same guy arriving... for the 3rd time in 5 years. HR is the target of jokes, not him. 19 years ago, I saw another case. The production engineer did leave the mill for a job near his family, didn't meet its objectives at the new job, and his replacement was subpar. Was back after one year. Was expected as the messiah. It's uncommon, but it happens. That's one of the reasons you shall NEVER burn bridges while leaving(sounds like you did not). You were not careful resigning before having a steady job, but I don't see anything else suspicious. In both case, the only important thing to do for them was not to show off. They're back because they had problems elsewhere, not at home. So it's not a big problem. 

I know a few consulting firms who have different "levels" of consulting. Depending on their customers, They know if they'd better offer mustangs or bad horses. The best artists always fear before entering the scene. It's good to have fear, as long as you're not dominated by it : it means you care about the quality of work you're going to make. I did 13 missions as a consultant, and I'm now working as a direct employee of a software company : I've always known fear before it would begin. Fear is just an information. Think about that : you are concerned about the quality of your work, and that's why you have fear. Now, you've found your previous job too easy. Too easy!!! You were not challenged. You're going to be challenged. Ad challenge is gonna push you further. Take problems once at a time, in case of doubt ask your manager for priority, and you're gonna make it. You're not a 15 years veteran as I am, they're not expecting as much from you as from me. You're going to learn a lot. You're going to doubt also. It's a good thing. Doubt means you're going to make progress, by reassessing things you were sure of. Doubt means you are forced to make progress. Doubt means you're going to face challenge. And that's what's cool : challenge, because it makes the best memories. Fear means the task in front of you is tough enough for your skill level. Enjoy. 

It's even worse in Germany, they are rather touchy about safety at work. But everywhere in the world, I'd expect you to assume the risks you've taken. 

Well, they just thought the strange paper was the reason you had not to go, so they genuinely believe they can still recruit you. I see no red flag there, just an honest misunderstanding. That being said, if you are not interested, no matter the reason, you don't have to spend any money. A mail answer explaining your lack of interest should leave the doubt(and if it does not, then, only then, it proves this company has problematic aspects, and you should avoid it at all costs). 

Well, no, as long as you don't have anything to contribute. Be sure to listen & to show it, OTOH, for example by taking notes. As a beginner, it's likely not much input is expected from you in meetings. If you progress in your knowledge, there will be a time you will feel the need to speak. 

The best advice I ever received was "work your foreign languages". In plural. Not only english. I did work german as well. When I did my end-of-studies training period, we were on a project for building a new type of light for cars. We needed a new kind of plastic, manufactured in germany. The commercial team from the german chemical corporation went to visit, and we had a meeting. There were two of them, our project leader, one engineer, and two trainees(including me). Our project leader began the meeting in english. Everyone else was fluent in german(and some not that much in english), and naturally, the discussion switched to german. Noone forcasted that, or wanted that. But it happened. Because he couldn't speak german, our perfectly bilingual french-english project leader was expelled from the decision process. And it was nearly unavoidable. When people have a job to do, they naturally go to the path of least resistance. All the advice of disciplining your team in the other answers are nice, but they're not going to solve that problem a satisfactory way. Try to learn at least some of their language to have an idea of what is happening. If not, you'll always be vulnerable. 

Is it common? Not that much. But it can be set up to work. The idea beyond is to avoid people as Single Points of Failure. Of course, it comes with a cost, and programmers pay the cost. That's why your boss will be tough to convinced it's a bad idea. He has all the advantages, and you all the drawbacks. Still, it makes sense. It makes sense it you spend time with other programmers to exchange knowledge and practice. This can be done by reviews, pair-programming, or anything else that works for you. I've been in a team of 22 where one consultant(there since years) was spending most of his time roaming in the corridors instead of programming. He was the glue of the team, and at least 15 people in the team could work on the programs I did make. It can be anything else that suits the need, informal discussions, coffee-machine exchange of knowledge..... But it has a cost. Worth to pay IMHO, but if everyone works on the same technology, it shall not be too costly. The cost is an heavy communications overhead. That's more what you shall communicate to your boss, as his idea is not bad in itself. Just, he has to understand it's an investment with non-immediate rewards.
