I thought that Les Stroud was about to make a taut line hitch. But at the end he did a couple of things a little different. What is this knot? Does it hold better than a taut line hitch? 

I've been top-roping for several months. About a month ago I found out how much fun bouldering is. I've been getting quite a few scrapes on the knees working certain routes, or from falling. I'm climbing at an indoor gym wearing shorts. Some people climb in long pants, but many don't. It's not a big deal, but I wonder if this is mainly a technique issue which will go away over time, or if there's some knee protection available that wouldn't reduce flexibility. 

I almost never get blisters. It's been a few years since I've had one, when I got a small blister between two toes. It was my own fault for not properly drying my feet after a creek crossing. My hiking shoe is a Chaco Red Rock. They're about 16 ounces each, which is too heavy for a hiking shoe. My plan is to switch to a lighter shoe, and there appear to be some excellent trail-running shoes in the 7 to 9 ounce range. Keeping the weight light on your feet is even more important than keeping a light load on your back. Ray Jardine recommends shoes that are 11 ounces or less. Next, always avoid natural fibers. No cotton, no wool. I wear polyester running socks cut below the ankle. Change your socks every hour or so when you stop for a break, and after you cross a creek. Polyester will not give you blisters as long as it's dry, because it will slide on your skin instead of grabbing and pulling your skin like natural fibers. Do this and you won't need to harden your feet. Just do some normal prep hiking and you'll be ready to go. If you're going to be hiking in snow over an inch or two deep you'll probably need to wear boots, in which case try some of the suggestions above. 

I just spray some Lysol into the shoe from time to time after returning home from climbing, and that seems to do the trick. I haven't noticed a downside to this, but perhaps some more experienced climbers can weigh in. 

If you drink enough water, it can kill you. There was a gal who died a couple years ago during a radio contest. But, you have to drink a lot. It's not dangerous in normal amounts. The distilled water you buy the grocery store or that you make yourself is laden with impurities that keep it from being dangerous. Water distilled for some laboratory uses (like the Z-pinch reactor) is distilled to 0.00000009% purity, and is caustic enough to burn through most things, even stainless steel pipes. 

Top-roping or lead-climbing? I haven't seen this happen in top-roping except when using the wrong rope - that is, for the rope next to the route i'm climbing. When you top out you should be near the pulley. If you're way off to the side, then, yeah, you should expect some swinging. If you're 5 feet from the pulley, you should expect to swing 5 feet each way until the swinging dampens. Spinning you should be able to control by leaning back and keeping both feet on the wall, which works unless you're passing an overhang. 

In season 3 episode 1 of Survivorman, Les Stroud uses a guitar and a can of some consistently shaped chips made from potatoes of an unknown brand <cough>Pringles</cough> to make a trap for mice or squirrels. My question is, since he has made snares for rabbits before, why doesn't he use any of the guitar strings to make snares for rabbits? 

I avoid water-resistant shoes for hiking since they trap moisture (your sweat) in as well as out. Kinda depends on hiking style, too - if you're ultralighting then you'd probably want trail-running shoes that breath and dry quickly as you walk. See Ray J.'s advice. They're light enough that people often carry a second pair. Another factor is weather - a bit of rain is no big deal, but if you're tramping through snow, then I'd think you'd want some water-resistant regardless of your style. I personally wear Chaco RedRock shoes. They're heavier than running shoes (about 16oz each), but they hold up well and have the high arches I need. Unfortunately, they take too long to dry, but it's usually not a huge deal. If you're conventional heavy-pack you'll probably want ankle support, which means boots. Whatever you get, do some trail walking in them before you go. Boots need break-in, and hiking in shoes means you want to strengthen your ankles before you go. Good arch support that matches your foot will help avoid ankle sprains. 

I've used muzzleloaders for years without a problem, but heard that the nipples can fail catastrophically, causing injury to the face. Is there a way to tell when it's time to replace them? 

There's a lot of variation between radios. There's even a great deal of variation for a given set. I own a pair of radios advertised as "35-mile range." I don't believe that's false, but it's probably under ideal conditions - a clear day with two people on mountaintops 35 miles apart, with an unobstructed view, for example. I did a test with mine where I left one radio at home and went for a hike in the woods. On a hilltop, I was able to carry on a conversation, though there was some static, at a distance of about 2.1 miles. There were trees and homes in the way for part of that distance. Hills in between would have made it impossible to talk. There are other limiting factors: Weather, being in a car or building, as a couple examples. Still, this is very useful for me for hunting and for backpacking. Furthermore, they have weather radios, which can be indispensable when you have no other way of knowing the forecast. In the US, they receive broadcasts from fixed towers, and my whole state is covered. 

Can I use my Sawyer filter when the city issues a boil order? Or could there contaminants such as viruses present that require boiling? How about other filters such as carbon filters? I'm confident that UV pens or bottles would be sufficient, but any commentary on those are also welcome. 

If I had done a little more homework, I would have found a manual online for this closely related bow. It describes drawing the bow either way. $URL$ It says: 

No, don't worry. At least in the US, and presumably a number of other countries, there are organizations that set the safety standards pretty high. As a result, IMHO, we've become much more suspicious of food that's not dangerous. You can backpack with unrefrigerated foods (like cheese and eggs) for a while, and they're still fine, but the safety folks would have to take deep breaths from a paper bag if they found out. ;) So...don't tell anyone, but I've left water in a bottle for months, drank it, and was fine. Now, I believe I have a pretty sturdy immune system, but I bet you're fine. 

Being in a hammock shouldn't change anything. A tent is not any safer, and may be more dangerous, since you don't have visibility of the area around you. Buy or borrow a copy of Trail Life, there's a good discussion of the issues with using a tent. A tarp is my preference over a hammock or a tent, because they make for a dryer and more comfortable night's sleep for me. The prime rule is to not cook near where you're stopping for the night. Cook and eat your evening meal a few miles before you make camp, and the bears will be drawn there instead of to your campsite. 

Notice that the ground is bone-dry, despite the rain. We're in the woods under good cover, so no surprise there. There is some TP left, but not much. It's almost completely decayed. What's left won't last long. The TP is well-rotted before any erosion has taken place and before any animals have dug it up. If you want to pack yours out, or use rocks or sticks or whatever, that's great. But I know how and where I can properly bury mine, so I'll keep doing that. I'm sorry if that triggers your righteous indignation, but it works if you know what you're doing. 

Based on Rickeyship's feedback, I'm changing my answer. Environmental Context The answer depends on your environment, so try to find out what makes sense in the context of where you'll be. My original answer works well in the woods of Missouri where your droppings will be subsumed into the environment, and you can make your catholes undetectable. However, if you're in a fragile environment, or an environment where droppings take longer to process, that approach would be problematic. Ricketyship gives the case of the western ghats as one such example. The arctic might be another, if I were to guess. In the fragile environments, follow his advice of a single, larger cathole. But overall, I think the right approach is to know the environment you're entering, and determine what the right answer would be in that particular context. Original answer Your cathole shouldn't leave a trace - that is, shouldn't be visible to anyone after use. So in that regard, maybe work on making your covered catholes invisible. When I use them, and when I've read about them, they're always small and only big enough for one use. Properly made, closed catholes shouldn't attract animals. Open ones might, but I've never left a used one open. One thing I've done that was helpful was to dig one before gong to bed so that I can use it first thing in the morning without need time to locate and dig one. Also, a cathole shouldn't damage the environment. So, save the top layer, whether grass or sticks and leaves, and put it back. Your droppings and toilet paper are fertilizer, and will become part of the earth quickly, benefitting the environment. 

That's the rule on the Ozark Trail and the Appalachian Trail, to the best of my recollection. However - many times the ground is just rock surrounded by bits of dirt. Do the best you can and use your best judgement. Remember that everything else dumps it in the woods without burying it, but they're not using TP, either. No one wants to step in it, see it, or see your TP scattered about by the wind. Try to make it so no one will know that you did your business there, and it should be fine. Edit 2013/09/07: Here's a cat-hole I dug and used the morning of 2013/08/11, that's about four weeks ago. The red ellipse encircles the cat-hole, just to make sure you can tell where it is: 

theJollySin is right. Your body adjusts to seasons by changing the viscosity of your blood. Thicker in winter to help stay warm, thinner in summer to help stay cool. Essentially, alcohol thins your blood, simulating what your body does to drop its temperature. Drink your whiskey, but sit close to the fire. Edit: The warming effect is not psychological. It's physiological. You feel like it's making you warmer, but it's not. 

From my comment - Some people keep a jar in the tent to pee in. I prefer not to. :) When the kids were young and we all went camping, my wife did this so she and the kids wouldn't have to leave the tent, warm weather or cold. 

Let's note a couple things. First, there's no erosion. It would be surprising to find erosion in a well-located cat-hole. Second, though it's been there four weeks, no animals have dug it up. There are 'possums, 'coons, deer, bobcats, pumas, coyotes, dogs, foxes, armadillos, squirrels and rabbits in the area. There's lots of scat in the area. I'm not sure what kind of animal might want scat, but there's plenty on top of the ground everywhere you go. Finally, notice that none of the TP is visible, and the cat-hole itself is pretty inconspicuous. So...the "erosion might expose the TP" and "animals might dig it up" theories are not born out here. Okay, now about the decay of the TP. This example is a worst-case example. When I'm backpacking, I use very little TP, because I start with leaves and finish with a little TP. But here, I'm on my own land, and did the whole job with TP. That means that I used a lot. Furthermore, it's not biodegradable TP, it's grocery-store TP. It's rained once or twice in the four-week period. Like I said, worse-case example, excepting that it could have been drier. What we see here should be far worse than the typical backpacking cat-hole. Let's dig it up and see: 

I'm assuming there won't be three parts of equal weight. Depending on the tent design, you could be talking main room, fly, and poles. You could break it into threes that way, then swap other items to equalize the load. So, if you're carrying the main room, perhaps someone could carry some of your share of the food, for example. 

I haven't used a wigwam, but I expect you'd have the same issues as with any shelter. You have to expect there to be some smoke, but you want the amount of smoke to be as low as possible. Perhaps the hole at the peak is not large enough, or perhaps you're not letting enough air in to feed the fire. Make sure you have a large enough crack at ground level to let the fire get sufficient oxygen. Any fire that's not getting enough oxygen will smoke more. I've been in old cabins where we had to open the front door to let air in when the fire was small. We could close it when the fire was larger. All of those issues relate to 'draw.' The fire needs to burn hot, or the smoke won't be hot enough to rise and escape through your vent. If your air intake isn't large enough, the fire won't burn hot, and you'll have lots of lukewarm smoke that won't go anywhere. If your vent isn't large enough, the smoke won't have anyplace to go, so it'll back up. So, try leaving the entrance open until the fire really gets going., and make sure you have good openings top and bottom to create sufficient draw. Oh, and it'd probably be good not to sleep between the air intake and the fire, or that cold air will run right over you.
