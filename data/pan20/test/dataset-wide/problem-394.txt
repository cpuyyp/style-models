Scientifically selecting germ cells and ensuring desired characteristics are in. (Keep in mind that identifying IQ boosting traits is hard and moreover some IQ boosting traits might have deleterious effects on phenotype functionality say via a predisposition towards neuroticism, so a high level understanding of the complexities of gene expression is required, currently outside our reach) Breeding in a small pool (i.e. Parsis or Ashkenazi Jews where many of the cascade components are ~100% prevalence); or Ensuring that the high-IQ parents also have high-IQ siblings, parents and grandparents. 

Funny thing, most of the rest of the universe is far, far more hostile to humans than the environment you describe. So, with gas masks glued to their faces (and absolutely no smoking) they might survive for a while, especially if they can build (fireproof) controlled environments where they can, for instance, safely take off the masks to eat, drink and complain about being sent there. 

Well, if the AI obeys Asimov1, there won't be a nuclear war. The AI won't allow it. It'll be all friendship and ponies. 

Imagine a laser capable of melting through a 1 inch steel plate in a second. Pretty impressive, no? Good, now make it 100,000 times more powerful. That's gamma rays. Recent tremendous advances in linear accelerator miniaturization (LAM) have completely revolutionized our capability to produce gamma* radiation cheaply and abundantly. Photon energy levels previously only attainable in distant cosmic object like magnetars, black hole accretion disks or as bremsstrahlung radiation in the most powerful cyclotrons of the previous decade (2010-2020) are now attainable in a vehicle-portable tabletop sized device. Due to the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the world, it is perhaps not surprising that the immediate application of the LAM technology is in the military area. With the involvement of DARPA and a number of secretive startups, the US has developed a lead in the field, and the most public of the startups has unveiled a prototype to US CENTCOM, where they estimate that a 1-meter diameter fixed-sentry (journalists quipped that it was shaped a bit like a Dalek from Dr. Who, minus the wheels) can be built for $50,000 and, with an appropriate power source, is capable of near-continuous (90-95% uptime) devastating fire in the MeV range ("fluorescence" is the current euphemism) with virtually no maintenance for up to 1 year unless physically damaged by enemy fire. The latest version also boasts impressive angular velocity and target acquisition and engagement speed is so fast that is it said that a human cannot actually see it move. While the US pioneered the technology, US adversaries are working overtime to replicate the technology, and the most advanced will probably succeed in doing so in the next few months/years. Already unreliable, overheating prone, lower-power versions have popped up in the arsenals of non-state actors in the never ending conflicts in West Asia. What would the main effect of such gamma-ray sentries be on the battlefields of the near-future? Can maneuver warfare persist under these constraints? *Gamma rays are extremely high energy, typically thousands to millions of electron-volts per photon, compared with 1.5-3 electron-volts per photon for visible light. So like light, except a million times more powerful, heh, heh.

Do this in a handwavium mine, and you’ve got parallel universes. You should look at the “Apprentice Adept” series by Piers Anthony.  It takes place in two parallel universes that have limited points of contact / overlap.  He doesn’t explain how this came to be; 

This is a little crude, in more ways than one.  Perhaps somebody can suggest improvements to (cough cough) clean it up. First of all, they’ll want to have a reservoir (or cistern) at (or, more likely, below) ground level.  This would allow them to capture and hold spring water temporarily, in case the spring and/or the pumping mechanism have varying flow rates.  (I’ll get back to that.)  If they’re collecting rainwater at ground level, they’re probably already doing this. As in initial capability, immediately after the apocalypse (or maybe even before), this could be as simple as a pond around the spring.  Given time to establish some infrastructure, there should probably be such a cistern in each building; this provides some security against bandits/raiders.  Rig something so that the water from the spring runs through pipes or other channels into the holding tanks in the basements of the buildings.  (Try to make it hard for attackers to slip poison into the reservoirs.) One added security measure is “security through obscurity” — after you have built a plumbing system that pipes the spring water into the buildings, bury it.  This may make it somewhat harder for adversaries to steal your water or tamper with the system.  Ideally, it will make the spring invisible. The question of getting the water to the upper floors remains.  Renan suggested a “bucketwheel”: 

To make is more traditional, I had an idea to be make it bigger. If the dragon can heat up scales at will (by a built in magic/biological mechanism) can it use this ability to facilitate flight (and therefore be larger)? As both heat and scales are magic, allow the scales to be comfortably be heated and maintained upto 1500C. If needed, older dragons could have thicker scales so hotter max temp. Realistic physics and biology allow it to be similar in size, wingspan, and flying ability to a shoebill without using magic. How big can I make it if it relies on your heating mechanism to fly? I included the following clarification in the comments: "I do not want an organic jet engine that has air passing though internal organs or an oversized air bladder" 

I think you need to figure out what your selkies are. If you want their folklore, you should ask this on mythology. As this is worldbuilding, your selkies are subject to your decisions. Selkies, to me, always felt like the result of either a fairie magic or the mystery of the sea taking people and turning them into seals. As they breed, some of their offspring can shed this magical skin and visit land. They, however, miss their family and the world they were born in. You could, however, easily reverse this by making true seals be turned into humans by their own or some third party's magic. Alternatively, you say they are a creation of nature the same as seals and fairies and have just always existed. If it is the first, they are essentially human but foreigners. They have all of the same instincts, feelings, behaviors as us but are not familiar with our specific customs. If they have no human origin, expect them to be mockups of a human. They may be kind and social but, for instance, they won't understand facial expressions or be able to learn language as a whole anywhere near as well. The first group may be able to talk immediately after leaving the water (if in a different tongue). The latter will be more silent. Personally, I would suggest you look to folklore and to the most familiar selkie story in modern times: "The Little Mermaid". Yes I know she is a mermaid technically. She is, however, a sea half-humanoid who shed her aquatic skin and came ashore looking human. Despite being from a different world and having difficultly communicating, she falls for and marries a human. This is clearly a "mostly human origin" version of course. This means that she behaves and acts like a playful (hey seals) young human who understands humans emotions and behaviors. She is, however, excited and vexed by what humans consider mundane. This is an easy but fun character to deal with. 

but handwaved the power source.  (For the record, I thought of this before I read the answers.)  If there’s power to spare, there are many options.  But the question said that all the solar power is accounted for, and that fuel (for the generators) is scarce, and I assume that the building complex isn’t within walking distance of a forest, a coal mine, or an oil well.  If the spring provides enough power to drive the bucketwheel (or bucket conveyor belt) and lift water 18 stories, that’s great, but that strikes me as unlikely. One idea that hasn’t been mentioned is to have a dual-track bucket conveyor belt.  One track would bring water up; the other would take waste material down, and thus provide the power to drive the belt and lift the water.  I am thinking specifically of toilet-type waste.  There might be others, but I imagine that these survivors would recycle as much as possible. The rate of disposal of waste varies with the time of day.  This is why it’s important to collect the spring water all the time, so the water that emerges from the spring overnight, and at other periods of low waste-disposal activity, doesn’t just go into the ground. Of course, if they’re using washing water, urine and feces in their gardens, this won’t work. 

The great Isaac Asimov seemed to think it was possible.  He wrote many short stories featuring Multivac, the ultimate supercomputer that spans the globe — and more — and slowly acquires control over everything, encroaching on personal privacy and freedom.  In his story “The Life and Times of Multivac”, one man analyzes Multivac’s structure and finds a weak point.  Then he physically attacks that point, triggering the downfall of the machine.

I am going to compare a 50kg and a 1g spider with a silk radius of .003mm. The breaking stess would be about 1000MPa for an average spider. Lets say the giant spider manages to get this up to 2000MPa which is the strongest in the world. Quick calculation shows that the 1g spider can hold about 3 times its body weight of a single thread of silk. How much would that need to be for a 50kg spider? Only .5mm This calculation is enough to show that in theory a spider with thin strands (say 2-3 mm) would be possible. In practice a spider often uses several strands of silk together. I have my doubts about the accuracy of the .003mm radius. Basically, however, this shows that a giant spider could still possibly use silk like a small one iff it were worth it. I don't believe that it is an evolutionarily favorable path which is why we don't see it. In your world, however, you could possibly make it work. Please note that there are likely many nuances that would make this more difficult for a larger spider. I don't want to lift myself by such a small part of my body. The thin diameter likely increases mechanical strength more than bulk properties would imply. There is likely evaporation which occurs in the thin strands which would not occur in a thicker one. There is potential to focus stress on a small region of the silk. Nevertheless, spider silk's properties are incredible and, while they would need to be thicker for a giant spider, they would not really need to be THAT thick. 

It depends on what you define as a legal person. Currently the punishment for animal cruelty is much less than murder. I think uplifted animals will almost immediately be seen as human for the case of being victims of violent crimes. A cute smart doggie should not be a victim. Likely capital punishments for criminal uplifted animals will remain in place for a long time even if your setting wouldn't otherwise have the death penalty. That is the current procedure for violent animals and it is easy to argue "the procedure didn't take properly". There will be some support for even punishment, however. There will be an even larger fight against animal-human marriage than with gay marriage (because ew). Which ever party gains the most by supporting voting rights for animals will heavily argue in favor of it while the other party may fight it. I essence with all this differentiation, laws will not be exactly the same for an elevated animal and a human. There are minute differences in laws for women and men (usually legal precident concerning paternity, divorce, sexual harrassment, etc.) and we pretty much the same. Between different species of animals there are differences. As a result, expect large protests fighting for these rights and a more silent majority against these changes. Expect that all species will eventually be viewed slightly differently under the laws based on intellegence potential, physical ability, and population. Insects will never be able to get an equal right to vote (can't ever be 18 anyways) while the voting age for dogs will drop to 2.5 human years (18 dog years). Final note: if a completely new country forms after this change with large enough populations of each uplifted species, you can expect voters to be represented by species in a simular way to how they are by state in the united states. Cats can decide their own appropriate voting age but their alloted number of seats in congress will be decided by some combination of total population, potential intellegence, and lifespan. 

Fun question. I'm guessing it would be a sword-fest, since you can easily render mages powerless. Why? You can always get a rival mage (or even a near-talentless squib) to flare out the mana in a region, and then you can safely go climb the tower, grab the uppity mage by the collar, and introduce her to your more stabby friends. The only way around that would be if mages were endlessly wandering, more like Tinkers than kings. At first glance, that could create a hell of a roving bandit problem, i.e. you'd get Genghis-Khan mages, who ride into a region, storm the forts, raid the vaults and move on. But better organized areas could of course have constant aura-flaring to prevent that, again sending the mages to the outskirts of civilization. So most likely you'd have quite powerful trickster roaming mages in marginal areas of wilderness, and powerless squib mages flaring out magic in "civilized" areas to prevent raids. Alternatively, instead of useless flaring, you can have roving craftsman-mages that use all the aura up for enchanting items as they move from city to city. So in conclusion Swordfest, with a bit of flaring/enchanting. 

No language is completely literal, and the very idea of concepts depends on it. When I refer to Michael Kjörling, I refer to a mapping metaphor, or an abstraction, since the real Michael Kjörling (♦) is an ever-changing collection of atoms and energy states organized in a meta-stable pattern, and thus different from millisecond to millisecond. Referring to Michael Kjörling (♦!!) by referring to the indices and Heisenberg-adjusted positions of all particles that comprise their body would be somewhat unwieldy in everyday conversation, and the abstraction of a continuing entity makes low-bandwidth lossy communication about that meta-stable pattern possible. Since we can only do lossy, low-bandwidth communication, that's a good thing (c). Same applies to rivers, trees, prey, etc. However, the species could have an aversion to unnecessary abstraction. English would be a pleasure to learn for ESL people were it not for the tens of thousands of blasted idioms. Could use a dose of no-nonsense carnivorous idiom-purging. 

If the people from history were still around, history would move more slowly. The idea that Racism is acceptable in the Western world is decreasing/dead because younger people don't think racism is okay (brought up that way with media and legal influence to ensure it) and the people who thought racism is okay are dying out. The morals/beliefs/stigmas of the past would still be present today even more than they currently are. I don't believe that religion is BS but water nymphs and mermaids are. Likely some people who claimed to have seen them in the 1500's would still be making that claims today. We would have more spread out children. We would still on average have roughly (+50 to 200% likely due to increased unnatural death rates) same number of children to maintain the population. Raising them would however take only 1.8% of our lives compared to 18% now. Our childhood would also be less large the same way. This would mean there would be about 10% the number of children in the world. This by itself is worth of a very long study. Easier to note, however, is that you will have fewer close age siblings. Unless you are twins or your parents are bad with birth control, you will not have siblings within 5 years of your current age. War would be worse. The horrible effects of war including the population decrease would last for 100s of years. Grudges would last longer. America would still hate Japan and everyone would hate Germany. That was less than the equivalent of less than 10 years ago. War would be less. "While I still remember the horrible things you did, I am still wounded from the last war. Our ideologies aren't really that different from the last time we fought." The rate of technological increase would seem larger. This would mean that people who thought the cotton gin was innovative would be trying to learn how to use an Iphone. That would be the norm! Our greatest minds would have 100s of years more to study the universe and (assumed) the memory to support it. If anything the actual rate of technological increase would be faster. Nevertheless, this means that a large portion of the population would be left behind to only do manual labor unless continuing education becomes more significant. Expect to return to school for a decade every 100 years to stay on the cutting edge of whatever exremely nuianced area you are actually an expert in. We would actually make things right! We wouldn't build houses meant to last 100 years... we would construct them of stone. The Rule for Life people would actually be the people who did something. The monarchys of our world have been the children of the children of conquerors. Most monarchs, would be the son of the conqueror who fought by his side. Increase unnatural death rates and death via disease would be observed for several reasons. If every time i go to the store i have some chance of dieing in an car accident, living to 1000 would give me alot more car rides. The same is true for fights with wild animals and older farmer brothers, floods, and extradimensional abductions. If we don't have kids till 200 then more people will die before having kids. More people will die of accidents and disease than old age. This also means more disabled people who survive the accidents living longer. With respect to punishment, if we became able today to live to 1000, I would demand loudly and aggressively for the death sentence for any convicted murderer. Currently a life sentence costs the amount to keep them alive for roughly 60 years. Death sentence costs legal fees plus the amount of time needed for due process (say 20 years). Life sentence is more economical is most cases. If you bump that up to 500 years+ of upkeep...
