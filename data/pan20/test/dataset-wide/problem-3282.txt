In other words, ergative/absolutive systems don't normally have a category "subject", just as nominative/accusative systems don't normally have a useful category "absolutive". Every clause has a subject in one system, and every clause has an absolutive in the other; and in both systems there are specialized cases that occur only with transitive verbs. As for the etymologies, ergative comes from the same Greek root as energy; with transitive verbs, the ergative is normally the agent (prototypically human), and in many languages this is generalized to a mark of agency or volitionality with various verb classes and constructions. Absolutive, on the other hand, is a generalized replacement for many other earlier names, including nominative, for the most common, default case in an ergative/absolutive system, which, besides being theoretically "the unmarked case", is often actually unmarked. Some preferred nominative because in split-ergative systems like most Pama-Nyungan languages, where the nouns use an ergative/absolutive system while the pronouns use a nominative/accusative one, the same morpheme often shows up as both absolutive with nouns and nominative with pronouns. 

So if that is a relative pronoun, it's an odd one. The thing is that that has been used for over 600 years to introduce tensed subordinate clauses. And it still is used that way for two out of the three kinds of subordinate clauses in Modern English. Tensed Noun clauses and Adjective clauses require or allow that, under varying rules: 

Just answering your headline question, in linguistics we usually talk about three basic kinds of subordinate clause (what you've called a 'nested sentence'): relative clauses, adverbial clauses and complement clauses. Relative clauses These are clauses (i.e. sentence-like constructions) that modify a noun. The first example in the question 'David hates the lizards who hate David' contains the relative clause '...who hate David', which modifies the noun 'lizards'. Adverbial clauses These modify another clause and have an adverb-like effect, for example: 'He went to bed because he was tired' where '...because he was tired' is the adverbial clause. Complement clauses Complement clauses are clauses that stand as subject or object in another clause, for example: 'I thought that you were going', wherein '...that you were going' is the complement clause. 

I think the standard definition of dialect makes this fairly clear: mutually intelligible varieties that differ in systematic ways. So 'Indian English' (if there is a single such entity and it is spoken as a complete linguistic code) is a dialect of English. I don't see why it has to be a L1 to be a dialect of English. 

This is an old problem within comparative Germanic linguistics. The main ideas out there have been: (1) Only Gothic has both þl- and fl-. The other Germanic languages must therefore have undergone a sound change þl- > fl-. (2) Gothic underwent a sound change fl- > þl-. The Gothic words with fl- are newer loanwords (or other ad hoc solutions). (3) Gothic underwent a conditional sound change fl- > þl-, but it's not clear what the condition was. It's not clear to me whether there is any consensus in the field here, to the extent that this topic has been sufficiently treated to allow a consensus to arise at all.

There's no need to invoke ordered rules in order to explain the vowel distinction between 'writer' and 'rider'. In both cases, the vowel is simply the same as in the non-derived forms 'write' and 'ride', where the distinction between /t/ and /d/ is still present, and it's this distinction between /t/ and /d/ that's responsible for the difference in the articulation of the /ai/ diphthong. The reason you can't detect any difference between the vowels in 'matter' and 'madder' is that these two words aren't derived from base forms where a /t/ and /d/ is present. You're actually being tricked by knowing their spelling. If you didn't, you wouldn't have any idea that one was spelled with 't' and the other with 'd', since these consonants are in fact always pronounced the same (as a flapped [ɾ]). This explains the lack of vowel differences in 'liter' vs. 'leader'. The word 'liter' isn't derived from a base with 't'. The word has a flap [ɾ], which is voiced, and vowels are lengthened before voiced consonants. Since both 'liter' and 'leader' (derived from 'lead') have the vowel before a voiced consonant, their vowels are the same. So what about 'sighter' vs 'cider'? Here you would expect the diphthong in 'cider' to behave like it does before other voiced consonants, since it has a voiced [ɾ]. As musicallinguist says in his answer, the 'Canadian raising' phenomenon typically affects /ai/ before voiceless consonants, but it actually affects some words where /ai/ is before voiced consonants as well. One of the words musicallinguist mentions that he has Canadian raising in is indeed 'cider', and I can verify that (not as a native speaker, but I have definitely heard people pronounce it like that). Other words where you have an 'unexpected' raised /ai/ include words like 'tiger'. I don't know if anyone has a good explanation for these exceptions. In 'slighter' vs. 'slider', you find a contrast in the vowels because they behave "normally", i.e. just like 'writer' vs. 'rider' (since they're derived from 'slight' and 'slide'). 

Here are some possibilities, I guess it depends on your test of telicity. In English telicity depends to a large degree on the semantics of the arguments. rent; allow; cause; cost; guarantee; leave; owe. 

The only grammar of Avar that I can find is this, in French: Charachidzé, Georges. 1981. Grammaire de la langue avar. Paris: Editions Jean-Favard. A Nook ebook version is, apparently, free from Barnes and Noble, but only if you're in the USA. You can see several pages of the grammar here. This review of the 4 volume 'The Indigenous languages of the Caucasus' mentions the Charachidzé grammar as well as several other works. I suspect they will all be difficult to obtain. A search of LinguistList gets this information, but no grammar. Ethnologue claims there is an SIL grammar (as well as a dictionary and Bible portions), but it might be hard to get. A search of SIL gets these results, but still no grammar. If you have a look at this paper on Avar from SIL the references might be useful if you read Russian (there's always Google translate). The paper includes the lead author's email address so you could try contacting him. You could also ask on the Caucasian studies mailing list CaucNet. Finally, you could try asking on LinguistList, or perhaps email Johanna Nichols, a linguist who has carried out much work on Caucasus languages. 

Mostly folks try out whatever they think will work in context, and they get to like some ways more than others. I know that doesn't tell you where each one originates, but there's very little direct evidence and therefore most of the possible answers are theory only. That's partly because there's a lot of syntax in English, and the vast majority of it has been innovated, at least in its present form, during the last millennium, since the grammaticalization wheel turned for English. For example, here's the table of contents, from p.3 of Haj Ross's list of The Top 200+ English Transformations of 2012: 

Probably the easiest one to talk about is Bahasa Melayu (Malay, Indonesian, Malaysian). As Jack Prentice put it in his review of Indonesian for The World's Major Languages, "pronoun" is an open class in Malay. Any noun that can refer to a human being can be used as a personal pronoun, and person, number, age, and gender (for example) are only a few of the many categories that are relevant to pronoun choice in Bahasa. Plus {Zero} is the most common pronoun, for all persons. By the way, much the same is true of related languages I'm familiar with, like Minangkabau, Acehnese, and Javanese. 

The answer is no. A palatalized /g/ is a different phoneme from a labialized /g/, and there is no obvious way that they are connected. 

And what is the definition of a syllable? Taking dictionary.com as an example, syllable is defined as "an uninterrupted segment of speech consisting of a vowel [...] (with or without preceding or following consonant sounds)". I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

My standard reference manual has always been Hans Krahe's "Germanische Sprachwissenschaft" from 1967. There's a later edition by Wolfgang Meid from 1969, but it is as far as I can see just a photographic reprint that Meid put his name on. Apart from that I'd recommend Streitberg's "Urgermanische Grammatik" from 1896 and Hermann Hirt's "Handbuch des Urgermanischen" from 1931-1934. 

The consensus is that Grimm's law occurs before Verner's law. You will in the field of Indo-European linguistics always find someone who claims the opposite of what the consensus says. So it's important to know what the consensus is. Here's an argument in favor of the traditional approach: Verner's law turns voiceless fricatives into voiced fricatives. You can read more about that in my 2011 paper "The phonetics and phonologization of Verner’s law". But, Verner's law also targets Proto-Indo-European */k/. How is that possible? Well, Grimm's law turns Proto-Indo-European */k/ into a voiceless fricative */χ/, so if we order Grimm's law before Verner's law, then the outcome follows: */k/ > */χ/ > */ɣ/. You can read more about that in my 2009 paper "The development of voiced labiovelars in Germanic". My papers are here: $URL$ I would like to know how those people who order these laws differently will explain these facts. 

This issue is discussed in some detail in this paper by the late, great linguist Larry Trask. The paper also gives a very nice introduction to argumentation in historical linguistics. The answer is that these terms are based on the earliest 'intelligible' babble of babies. The most common first syllable produced by babies is [ma], with [pa/ba/ta/da] following soon after. These earliest articulations are probably just play for the child, but are interpreted by parents as attempts by the baby to address them. As mothers tend to be the main early caregiver the earliest-occurring syllable, typically [ma], is interpreted as referring to them, while the next-occurring syllables are very commonly interpreted as referring to the father. This gives rise to the strong, but not invariant, association of [ma] with 'mother' and [pa/ba/ta/da] with 'father'. 

There is no evidence of a linguistic link between Dravidian languages and Australian languages and I haven't heard of a proposal for 'Dravido-Australic' superfamily. Typologically the groups of languages are quite distinct although of course comparing two groups of languages is always going to generate lots of similarities between individual languages. Taking Tamil as the canonical Dravidian language, it has a phonology which is quite different from Australian languages, having numerous fricatives and affricates (famously absent from almost all Australian languages), a large set of approximants. Tamil also has many more vowels than Australian languages, which typically have 3. While Tamil is superficially similar to Australian languages in grammar, both being agglutinative, it is much more so than Australian languages and can string together large sequences of suffixes to produce very large words. But as commenter @TKR points out, the comparison of the present-day languages, whether of phonological inventories or the grammar, are not useful as evidence of ancient connections as they would have changed substantially since that time. Australian languages fall into several quite distinct families. The largest one, Pama-Nyungan has had some reconstruction work and the results do not look like Dravidian languages. As well, proto-Pama-Nyungan is usually given a time-depth of around 5,000 BP, so it along is too old to be connected to Dravidian languages at 4,000 BP. And of course proto-Australian (if there ever was such a thing) has a much greater time-depth. As for the Indian connection of 4000 years ago, that was a finding in one genetic study, others have had different results, including a divergence between Australian and South Asian Y chomosomes of around 54,000BP. And of course Indians have been present in SE Asia for over 1,500 years, while over the last few centuries there has been regular contact between peoples of SE Asia (Macassans in particular) and Australia, so an Indian genetic link could have been brought to Australia that way. But even if an Indian genetic link was substantiated, evidence about a linguistic link is a quite separate matter. To summarise, a Dravido-Australic language superfamily has not been proposed because there is, at present, no evidence of such a connection. 

These are normally marked with the for...to complementizer, though the for that marks the subject of the clause is frequently absent, along with the subject itself. 

Which (kind of) language(s) is/are easier for a child to learn as the first language? (Or is there any difference at all?) Which (kind of) language(s) is/are easier to learn as a second language? (Does it make a difference whether it's before or after puberty?) Which (kind of) language(s) is/are easier to learn for speakers of ? (Almost always, "English" is understood, which is part of the problem right there.) 

Well, not simultaneously, no. Not in the same sentence. But as these exercises makes clear, it can happen that a particular English verb, like want, governs Equi (aka "Equivalent Noun Phrase Deletion" and "Control") in one context, 

The reason is that people, even people who're speaking the same language, are each doing it -- and each learned it in the first place -- in their own individual manners, for their own individual reasons, with their own individual strategies and histories and perspectives and beliefs, and all that may fit in nicely with the way a particular language is set up. Or it may not. There's no way to tell in advance. That's the reason why some people seem to pick up a language right away while others never lose their native accents in their native language, even after decades away from it. Some people feel more comfortable speaking one language in a given situation rather than a different language; this seems about as normal as feeling more comfortable with certain foods or clothing in a given situation than with other choices, and there's no way of predicting that, either. We can't even characterize language learning usefully, let alone describe it or predict it; everyone's language habits are uniquely their own; just like their microbiomes. 

The kind of structure you ask about is known as an interlinear gloss. It consist minimally of three lines: the first line being the language being analysed, with segmentable morphemes separated out by hyphens; the second line is in the analysis language and has a gloss (usually a grammatical category label) for each morpheme in the first line and is spaced out so that each glow lines up vertically with the appropriate morpheme in the first line; finally, the third line is a free translation. This sounds complicated so here is an example to clarify: 

Answering this question requires defining "language" and "dialect". It's easier to do this by using the non-technical word "variety". 

English (at least in the present-day) can be characterised in terms of VOT as having short-lag (voicing beginning soon after release) versus long-lag (voicing begin some time after release) plosives whereas some languages, such as Spanish, have lead (voicing beginning some time before release) and short-lag plosives. So you appear to be suggesting that plosives in the upper-class British English of a century ago were more like modern Spanish plosives. It would be helpful to understand where you get this impression. As @jlovegren says, a half-decent recording of Jones or someone else from that era could easily be used to test the hypothesis (so you could confirm or refute the claim). For what it's worth, my impression from listening to Jones is that the hypothesis is not correct. 

In /l/, there's a closure between the sagittal middle of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Air is released along the sides of the tongue. In /s/, more or less the opposite happens. The sides of the tongue are raised, and a groove is formed along the sagittal middle. If you move the tongue from an /l/ towards an /s/, and you don't time the formation of the groove correctly, you'll form a complete closure between the tongue blade and the roof of the mouth. The sound emerging from that configuration is a /t/. In short, /t/ is formed as a transition from /l/ to /s/ when the different tongue configurations are not perfectly synced. As a side note, the reverse happens in Icelandic, where the sequence sl- is pronounced /stl-/. 

According to some, yes. I was in the class provided in the link. The example I remember the most was this language somewhere in eastern Russia where all the nouns came from one language and all the verbs from the other (the two languages being a native language and Russian). 

First, your question at the end doesn't really make sense, because conjunction is not subordination. I think you're asking for languages without subordination, so you shouldn't add "or conjunctions". So to what I think is your actual question: Are there languages without subordination? Pirahã is claimed to be such a language. And of course your Latin teacher is right when saying that "that may have been the way people spoke in the past", because "that" here refers back to "parataxis and hypotaxis using coordinating vs subordination conjunctions". 

(Bowern, C. 2004. 'The origins of tense-based case marking in Pitta-Pitta and Wangkajutjuru'. Australian Journal of Linguistics, 24:2) There are a number of other Australian languages with similar behaviour. Another example is Gurnu: 

The use of motion verbs to mark tense and/or aspect and/or modality is very common across the world's languages, both as part of serial verb constructions or as auxiliary verbs. Below are some non-Indo-European language examples. Sùpyìré, Niger-Congo family. Serial verb construction with the verb sí 'go' indicating futurity: 

It's not possible to list all measures as it has been estimated (Rudman, 1998) that over 1,000 different measures had been developed up to that point. Some useful references are listed below. 

While I'm not aware of any such place or academics that specialise in constructed languages, it is possible to research them for higher degree studies in linguistics. This is probably most true of departments which have a focus on descriptive/documentary linguistics. I am aware of one person who is doing a doctorate on a constructed language that is used for religious purposes by a group in an Asian country. Being a constructed language (and not anyone's first language) it is not complete, in the sense that there are numerous gaps in what can be expressed (ie things that all natural languages can express). For this reason a lot of the analysis is on the sociolinguistics of the situation that led to the construction of the language and which continues to support its continued usage. It has been suggested that Classical Sanskrit can be considered a constructed language. Classical Sanskrit may be studied at many universities and it is quite possible to do higher degree research on it.
