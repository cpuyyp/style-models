The set theory example is a very good one in my opinion (I am biased), and can serve as a proxy for many other versions. What are we doing in our heads when we 'form a set'? Naively and intuitively, we are collecting together some objects (possibly an infinite number of them) and trying to consider them all at once. So when I say 'the set of all real numbers', I would like to consider all real numbers together at once as opposed to some individual real number. Similarly, when I consider 'a real number' I am actually considering an infinite subset of rational numbers, since each real number is isomorphic to a Dedekind cut of rational numbers. It turns out that we can naively form sets like this for a long time without much issue -- this was what mathematicians did prior to the revolution in set theory that occurred in the 20th century. But at a certain point, the collections we're considering become so large that paradoxes are foisted upon us if we do not explicitly create a new notion of 'forming a large set' in our head that is distinct from the 'forming of smaller sets' we were intuitively doing earlier. This is the basis for a distinction between a 'proper class' and a set. In MK class theory, a prominent set theory capable of handling and predicating upon proper classes, we say that all collections are classes -- sets are those classes which are already members of some other class, and a class is a proper class whenever it is not a set. This seemingly technical process allows us to legitimately avoid paradoxes like the one you mention -- the class of all sets which are not members of themselves is not a member of itself and not a set. We don't actually have to stop here though; we can then define a notion of 'super-classes' which contain proper classes as their members, and 'super-duper classes' which contain super-classes as their members, etc. This is all legitimate, however if we prove a statement A true for all sets that does not make it true for any proper class a-priori, and proving it true for all proper classes does not make it true for any super-classes, etc. All of this business is driving at the idea that we can sometimes create solid and rigorous notions of objects which are not well defined when approached naively, if enough care is taken. That being said, I would argue that we cannot coherently discuss objects with properties that are true and false at the same time in the same sense. If we try to form the set of all sets which do not contain themselves, then it is not a member of itself which implies that it is a member of itself which implies that it is not a member of itself... This object is incoherent in my opinion and accordingly ineligible for rational discussion, as is the class of all classes not members of themselves, and the super-class of all super-classes not members of themselves -- the super-class of all classes not members of themselves, however, is probably a well defined object. Some objects are only 'non-existent' as a result of our poor decision making for the logical context in which they are defined, like the class of all sets not members of themselves or unicorns or Harry Potter (in our universe). There are particular objects, however, which essentially do not exist outside of my ability to ask you to consider them and as such are actually logical red herrings, like the set of all sets not members of themselves. 

Society has a reliance on certain environmentally unsound practices. I don't think it should have this reliance. The problem is a deep societal problem. To change anything we need to change the structure of society - treat the cause not the symptoms. Being overly idealistic in every day life endangers my ability to change things (e.g. one might need to fly to get to a environmental conference), and in some cases can alienate me from those people whose attitudes I wish to change (no one listens to hippies). Therefore, there are limits to what I am obliged to do with regards to adopting an ecological lifestyle, though I am obliged to determine these limits conscientiously. 

This just means that he knows this is something that happens, the word see is often used like this in English. Generally, word see is often used to refer to facts which are more objectively true, or at least have some privileged position - compare with "I hear that ...". This association has roots that go back at least as far as Aristotle's Metaphysics (see Jonas, The Nobility of Sight). 

I'm going to go against the grain here and say that no, there is no coherent sense in which science necessarily depends on philosophy in and of itself. By the definition of scientific pursuit, when science has become sufficiently robust we will not need philosophy or religion to understand any facet of reality that we encounter. We will simply design an experiment that allows us to test conjectures about the behavior of the facet under consideration, confirming or denying various properties of it until we have answered our question empirically. Physics today is very far from being able to do this for questions like "what is consciousness", "what is the mind and how does it differ from the brain", "where does the law of gravity come from", etc., but it is an error of pride to claim that because we currently require philosophical conjectures to patch over scientific ignorance we will always need these philosophical patches (even if we cannot currently conceive of a way to do science non-phenomenologically). It is possible that the nature of reality and its link to our consciousness fundamentally precludes us from being able to answer certain questions, but we are nowhere near being able to claim this with any certainty. If we do reach such a point we could reasonably say that our understanding of science requires some philosophical conjectures, but I still believe it is incoherent to claim that science itself depends on philosophy. 

For an easy to read theory of consciousness I recommend Biocentrism by Robert Lanza. Engaging, accessible to the layperson, and, IMO, incredibly compelling. 

3 is correct. Time is a abstraction, a filing system used to arrange events and memories into a logical system of cause and effect. Per relativity, space and time are not discrete entities, but a single construct called spacetime. Saying something is X km long is equal to saying it is Y seconds long. All units of time are based on and can be reduced to measures of distance. Time is a mental construct used to make sense of movement. Movement produces the sensation and experience of time, not the other way around. 

"Biocentrism", by Robert Lanza presents a complete metaphysical framework of life and the universe with quantum mechanics at the center of his arguments. 

"Time is that which clocks measure" -Einstein The moving hand of a clock does not "prove" the existence of time any more than the markings of a ruler "prove" the existence of space. A ruler allows regular, repeatable comparisons of length, nothing more. The moving hand of a clock is just a regular, repeatable motion that allows people to synchronize their movements and activities. Additionally, because the first clocks were based on pendulums, and the definition of a second is based upon the wavelengths of radiation emitted by a Cesium atom, we see that our notion of "time" comes back to and reduces to distance. "The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion" - Einstein 

The quantity can only ever be smaller than or equal to one. So, you can disbelieve in the Christian God, even all existing specifications of a God, and still assign a probability 0.5 to the statement "there is a God". The probability above sets an upper bound for the probability assigned to any particular specification of a God. Of course, many naturalists would assign a much lower probability to ("there is a God") in which case I maintain that they hold a belief in the statement "there is not a God". 

The idea that the inductive process that happens in science is best modelled by Bayesian reasoning has been around for a long time. Edwin Jaynes' book, The Logic of Science (freely available online) is usually cited in this context. I'm not going to repeat the arguments here as they have been far better articulated by others and this answer is kind of long already. To your specific question: 

In order to have a really coherent discussion about these things, it is difficult to avoid some usage of mathematics -- the thoughts involved are very precise and esoteric, and mathematics is good at expressing such things without ambiguity. We typically model "spacetime" as a manifold; a collection of points together with a bunch of rules (coordinate functions) for assigning each point to some point in (usually) Euclidean space. In string theory, we can use 'compactified manifolds' which themselves have other manifolds packed into each point on their surface to model a 'higher dimensional' reality in which many of the dimensions (all but three) have been packed into these extra manifolds. The question of whether spacetime is continuous or discontinuous, in this context, amounts to a question of what coordinate function domain we want to use on the manifolds. If we use coordinate functions which map into the real numbers (or Euclidean space as above) we can determine 'what the manifold' looks like by checking its Gaussian curvature, looking at the local metric for spacetime represented as a tensor, so on and so forth -- this is largely the domain of general relativity. We can have the coordinate functions map into some other space, however, and this will produce fundamentally different types of manifold. These structures have points with nothing 'in between' them if we choose the correct coordinate domain besides the reals -- consider that for any two real numbers x and y such that x < y, there is always some third real number z such that x < z < y. If we move to the integers instead of the reals, however, for any integer n there is clearly no other integer between n and n+1. This is how we model the notion of nothing being 'in-between' two points in space time -- we pull the coordinates for our space time from some place with an ordering structure that permits two objects to have nothing ordered in-between them, then look at the corresponding objects on our space time manifold. The question of whether or not there 'is space' between two orbits can be asked clearly in this context -- we ask whether the coordinate functions for our space time are pulled from Euclidean space (so there is space between the orbits which is just inaccessible to the particles traveling on the manifold), or whether they are pulled form some discretely ordered space (in which case there is actually 'no space' to occupy in there). Hopefully this can help answer your question of how to think about the problem, as this is a an open problem to date in physics and as such has no widely accepted answer. 

In mathematics everything that is different is distinguished and one considers a totality of distinct things. This avoids the tricky part: human judgement. This judgement is often easy for us. It is clear that we perceive many things as distinct and that the world "crystallises" into objects. Although this perception is not always all that is needed for distinguishing between things, in most day-to-day situations it is enough. It is only in edge cases where we need to go beyond our the appearance of objects separated in space, and use some other mode of judgement. The ability to distinguish between things is the main topic of the scientific field of psychophysics, which really got going around the 1890's and continues to this day. There have been many philosophical writings about it this human capacity too, in fact I'm of the opinion that it is the main question of philosophy (others may not agree). To answer your question directly: mathematics excludes human judgement, so when constructing a formal system we must start after judgement has been made - we do it by assuming that its objects are all distinguishable from each other. If objects in mathematics are not distinguishable they are taken to be the same. This is not true of real things, which can be different but not distinguished. 

Perhaps it is better to deconstruct the notion of time altogether. Neither the past nor the future actually exist. The past is what we call a collection of memories. The future is speculation upon what memories might be added to the existing pile. Both are mental constructs, and have no physical characteristics. Time is simply the way we manage our pile of memories, and arrange them into a logical procession, a filing system and nothing more. Remember that space IS time, and time IS space. It is equally correct to say that something is X miles long as it is to say it is Y seconds long. Time is an indication of movement. Time is how we make sense of movement. Movement produces the sensation/experience of time, not the other way around. Indeed, if a giant button was pressed that stopped all movement in the universe, would we not think that time had stopped as well? How could we confirm time's "flow" or even its very existence with a universe in which no movement occurred? Without motion, the ability to compare two different physical states, time loses all meaning. That thin demarcation between the ideas of past and future is the present, and is the only thing that truly exists. To answer your question then, "time" "moves forward" because it is an accretive process, an idea that is relative to an individuals experiences. 

This would be described by a "correct" usage of the exception that proves the rule. By specifying boys when perhaps you don't need to (you could say "unruly children"), the contrary of your statement applies for those children who are not boys. Quite often "the exception that proves the rule" is taken to mean "X therefore not X in general", which is logically incorrect, but not what is meant here. Generally the utterance "boys can't play" does in fact imply "girls can". Because if both could play, or none could play, you either wouldn't say anything or would say "children". There is more information in what you say. It's less clear in cases where there is an adjective, as it is difficult to determine the assumptions that are implicitly made. If you say "boys can't play" it's clear this is applied with a group of children in mind. But if you say "unruly boys can't play" its unclear whether the group you have in mind: all the children, the unruly ones, the girls, or less likely the not-unruly girls and the unruly boys. So the "unruly" case is using the exception that proves the rule where perhaps it shouldn't. Is it a fallacy with a name, who knows. The exception-that-proves-the-rule-when-it-doesn't-fallacy?
