The alleged article is from 1986, though Dettman's publication list stops in 1983. The title of that article doesn't seem consistent with Dettman's prior publication titles. The journal doesn't seem consistent with Dettman's prior publication venues. This source lists Dettman's titles with both "BA" and "PhD"; it's incredibly strange to list a Bachelor's degree along with a PhD. 

Since the above was from Wikipedia, here's an excerpt from the Textbook of Clinical Pediatrics, Volume 1, "Hair Disorders and Alopecia" (2012): 

This finding seems to conclusively support Damore's claim that "Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males". Gender assignment practices appear to be changing It appears that the practice of raising biological males as female due to such structural issues is declining: 

While these patents seem to be targeted at different intellectual properties, the description of what blue scorpion venom's uses are seem to have changed despite being from the same author. This may reflect a changing understanding from someone heavily invested in the topic. It's also worth noting that their most recent description doesn't seem to make a particularly solid claim. 

3. In the probable context, this claim seems plausible According to an Australian government health website, smallpox hasn't appeared in Australia since 1938: 

Since the first paper claims that microwaving increases the amount of caffeine released from 76% to 92%, it stands to reason that microwaving tea can make it less healthy for some. Other potential issues The second paper cited above, on the potential health benefits of tea, also discusses some of the potential negative impacts (beyond that of caffeine). Figure 1 from that paper shows a pathway to potentially increased cancer rates, while they also discuss the potential for the sugars in tea to contribute to diabetes. However, these effects are also quite speculative. 

tl;dr- Yes, wearing hair such that it's pulled tight can cause hair loss. Wearing loose-fitting hair styles or head wear shouldn't cause as much hair loss; whether or not it causes none at all or just a little is unknown. A good overview of related conditions is provided in "Hair Disorders and Alopecia" (2012) from the Textbook of Clinical Pediatrics, Volume 1. 

2. If real, the context may've been the Australian population Glen Dettman lived in the pre-globalization days in Australia. His childhood, education, and professional career were all in Australia, and his publications seem to largely be in journals that explicitly have "Australia" in their titles. And as the earliest-found source of the quote claims, Dettman's work was largely with Australians and the problems specific to Australia: 

Caffeinated tea can be unhealthy for some The same author goes on to publish "Caffeine in Green Tea: Its Removal and Isolation" (2013) by Quan Vuong and Paul Roach, in which the abstract begins: 

However, Jeff Bezos's plan to buy the Washington Post wasn't announced until 2013-08-05. Since that time, most of the articles I can find are factual rather than advocating an opinion. One of the most directly related is from 2016-02-05, in which the Washington Post reports: 

The gist is that, if you leave things in contact with each other, they'll eventually reach some thermal equilibrium. Then, by definition, those two objects are at the same temperature. This means that, if something like a cucumber is left in a stable environment, then it'll reach that environment's temperature. No matter what that cucumber does - even if its molecules start bouncing around wildly, or teleport around the place, or start emitting an eerie, supernatural green light - its temperature is defined as that of its environment. This means that we can't observe a temperature difference at equilibrium because that claim literally doesn't mean anything. But temperature gradients are possible outside of equilibrium The above only applies at equilibrium. Obviously, if you drop a cucumber into an oven, the outside will tend to heat faster than the inside, allowing for a significant temperature gradient to exist If the oven keeps running, then the entire cucumber will eventually reach the same temperature, but it'll take time to get there. Source of the claim isn't scholarly The above question cites "Cucumbers: Natural Food", HowStuffWorks: 

Technical stuff This section's to provide further explanation of the original study, and some of the content's a tad technical. 

In other words, if a 1-year old scores as well as a 2-year old, then they'd have an IQ of 200. This leads to their claimed results: 

tl;dr- This claim is true. It may sound weird that some biological males are castrated and then raised as though they were female, however it's been done to address a birth defect where genitals aren't properly formed. A recent survey suggests that this practice is in decline. Other studies show that sex-specific biology affects behavior in ways that aren't reversed by genital reconstruction or social conditioning. These biological differences include hormone levels and brain structure. 

The quote's attribution seems dubious. If the quote is real, it may've been in the context of the Australian population and how they wiped out smallpox by 1938, not in the context of the global population in which major vaccination efforts were pushed after 1950. The limited information found so far leaves the claim that smallpox was eliminated in Australia without more than 10% of the population getting vaccination plausible. 

Ultimately, the $77/week isn't realistic, nor does the source claim that it is. Its primary problems are: 

Anyway, he's nonetheless started a non-profit organization called Novobiotronics, apparently with support from a GoFundMe campaign that claims 6,500 USD in donations. On that GoFundMe, Holland claims: 

Most people who earn minimum wage don't live on their income alone. (reference) Most people who earn minimum wage don't pay for their own single-bedroom apartment (reference), much less at average cost since low-income households spend a fraction of the average (Figure 5). For the minority of minimum wage earners who are poor, there are food stamps and other assistance programs. (acknowledged by the challenge source) 

Comments Poverty's a horrible thing, and this answer isn't meant to suggest otherwise. Merely, the $77/week challenge is political bunk, not factual reality. 

tl;dr- It's unclear where this quote originally came from. The earliest references to it seem to be in Spanish from 2001, while the earliest English variants seem to appear in 2008. English sources predominately attribute the quote to The World as I See It (1949), however the quote doesn't seem to actually be in that book. Earlier Spanish references attribute it to The Crisis, however no work by that name appears in any major listing of Einstein's publications. It appears that Einstein wrote letters to a magazine called The Crisis. It's possible that this alleged quote may've been from such a letter. Since this is possible-but-unverified, it's difficult to either refute or confirm the authenticity of this quote given only the information provided below. 

are their guessed values. What this means is that they don't have real data or anything like that, but rather they're making up numbers, and most of their numbers result in the equations crashing (non-"[s]ustainable oxygen production"). So, their strategy's to keep guessing numbers 'til their equations stop crashing, the range of which constitutes the "relatively narrow parameter range". Then, how does global warming affect that? They have no idea. In fact, any slight cooling or warming can throw off those parameters again. Alternatively, they could select parameters that're stable for extreme global warming, in which case their equations would predict that global warming is necessary to save the world. 

tl;dr- No, $77/week isn't a realistic figure for full-time minimum wage workers. There's not really much to debunk here since the figure's source doesn't claim that it's factual or even realistic. Note that the original website isn't hosted anymore; going to the same URL seems to lead to some sort of blog/advertising site. The below analysis is primarily based on the "challenge toolkit" PDF. The $77/week figure As noted in the question, the figure's calculated as the weekly income, less taxes, less living expenses, coming to $78.46/week. As explained by "LIVE THE WAGE CHALLENGE TOOLKIT": 

The above calls out "tight pony tails" and "tight hat bands". As noted in the question statement, there are some people who point out the uncertainty over loosely worn hats, e.g. from "Will Wearing Hats Make You Go Bald?" (2012): 

So, the original authors don't stand by this claim. They're being excessively generous in describing their prior paper as "theoretical", but at least they've conceded that it's "hypothetical". The original study was indefensible. They literally picked vastly oversimplified equations, kinda like trying to do a large quantum mechanical model with a linear regression, and then literally guessed values for their constants based on what seemed easiest. Then, when the equations crashed, they described it as predicting doomsday. As described in an observer's blog: 

Early skepticism The literature seems to show an evolution through time. Back in 2004, it was recognized as a folk treatment with uncertain effects: 

So, they're assuming that someone earning minimum wage is renting a 1-bedroom apartment at the average national rate. This isn't at all realistic; most minimum wage workers live with others, and there's simply no reason that someone struggling to buy food wouldn't tend to prefer cheaper apartments. However, the people issuing the challenge didn't claim that this was realistic in the first place: 

Given this background, along with the plausibility of the quote in this context (discussed in the next section), it seems likely that, if real, the quote may've been in the context of Australia. 

Finally, it should be understood that while the original claim, if real, may've been defensible, a misrepresentation of it taken outside of a context in which it may've been defensible doesn't necessarily enjoy the same validity. Of course the smallpox vaccination attempts were far more crucial to wiping out smallpox worldwide. 

Einstein's correspondence with The Crisis appears to have been a basis for a book, "Einstein on Race and Racism" (2005; on Amazon.com). The earliest date I can find for this book is 2005, while online sources in Spanish seem to date back to at least 2001, so it's unlikely that this book could be the original source of this quote, if it even shows it. However, it seems plausible that the alleged quote might be related to something that Einstein wrote to The Crisis. This would explain why it doesn't sound like Einstein's usual tone and why the earliest sources seem to call the essay "The Crisis". Since this is a plausible source for the alleged quote, it's difficult to refute the possibility that it might be real. But, it remains unverified. 

Since there's no English version on Google before late-2008, it seems likely that the English translation originated from these. 3. Claimed to be from Crisis or The Crisis The Spanish sources usually claim that this is from an Einstein work called "Crisis" or "The Crisis", despite the later English sources attributing it to The World as I See It. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any major Einstein work called either "Crisis" or "The Crisis". Searching Einstein Archives Online yields several works with crisis in the title, but none appear to match up. However, apparently there was a major magazine called The Crisis, which it seems that Einstein wrote to: 

tl;dr- Yes, it sounds like blue scorpion venom is recognized as a folk treatment for cancer in Cuba, but, no, it's not well-regarded in current medical literature. Below are a few papers that discuss both blue scorpion venom in specific as well as other scorpion venoms. While it sounds like there's an interest in finding possible uses, the scientific opinion of the folk practice seems to be pretty critical. A recent paper describes a product from blue scorpion venom, Escozul, as a "pseudomedicine", and a paper from 2017-03-21 notes that there wasn't any supportive data from clinical studies in peer-reviewed journals. 

While this quote is attributed to the author of the journal article, this claim doesn't appear in the journal. Rather: 

So, that study demonstrates that unambiguously male infants, i.e. those with XY chromosomes, still retain male behaviors despite castration and being raised female. 

Since the USS Nimitiz was first launched in 1972, that means that it went for about 26 years before refueling, and then the refueling process itself took 33 months. Likewise, the USS Carl Vinson (asked about in this question) was launched in 1980, but didn't start to refuel until 2005. Is that really "unlimited"? Seems close enough to "unlimited", given that it could've circled the globe more than 300 times in that time if it maintained 30 knots as-the-crow-flies. The 300-times figure appears to be generous, as there's significant reason to believe that the carrier can't actually sustain non-stop top-speed over this entire time period. A more informed ballpark figure might be on-the-order of 40-times-around-the-world-as-the-crow-flies. Please note that these figures are meant to estimate scale in appreciable terms from the given figures, not to serve as an actual claim about real-life performance. More in the comments below. [off-topic] Safety This part of the question is off-topic for SE.Skeptics: 

tl;dr- A cucumber equilibrates to the environment's condition, such that there's no temperature difference. However, cucumbers can resist temperature changes fairly well, such that if you just pull them out of a cool environment (or drop them into a warmer one, e.g. an oven), then they can be much cooler inside than outside. Ultimately, the claim appears to have come from a trivia fun-fact in a promotional pamphlet. Temperature differences at equilibrium are impossible by definition The scientific definition of temperature comes the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: 

Yes, in some cases. The risk seems to depend on the cell phone and pacemaker involved. Apparently there's no conflict in some cases, while there can be in other cases. The American Heart Association (ACA) does warn that some newer cell phones can make pacemakers less reliable. Given these risks, it makes sense that Japanese trains - which are notorious for having people cramped together - would warn about cell phones, as there's a lot of potential for someone with a pacemaker to end up smooshed against someone with a cell phone at minimal distance. Sources From "Interference with Pacemakers and Other Medical Devices", FDA: 

Obviously the study referenced above was very weak and far more likely explainable due to other factors, but since it happened a long time ago, people who heard it or studies like it may've jumped to conclusions that didn't pan out. Reference: What's kerosene? Kerosene isn't a simple chemical, so samples of kerosene can have significant variation in content. This makes it relatively difficult to discuss compared to chemicals that always have the same composition. In short, kerosene's like gasoline or diesel. It started out with ancient plant/animal life dying and turning into fossil fuels, which is then pumped out of the ground as crude oil. Crude oil is then split via fractional distillation, where it's boiled in a series of stages, each time at a lower temperature, until it ceases to boil.
