with the loss of the -mos desinence that marks the first person plural, and the change of the pronoun, from "nós" to "a gente". Nowadays both sentences are already considered standard, though, a century ago, the second one would be considered wrong, or colloquial at best. Now here is an intermediate sentence, in which the verbal ending is lost, but the pronoun remains unchanged: 

Superficial similarity is a very lousy index of etymological relation. For intance, take these two pairs of English/Portuguese words: 

For instance, in Portuguese, um chimpanzé gosta de bananas usually has not this generic meaning of "chimps love bananas", and would be used in different contexts. And o chimpanzé gosta de bananas is at least ambiguous, and I think would be used more like as "this chimp loves bananas". Furthermore, chimpanzé gosta de banana (for some reason, now the object needs going in the singular, too) is colloquial, not standard (which would be chimpanzés gostam de banana(s), with the object accepting both singular and plural. And, finally, as you see, banana in any case rejects articles. And so the usage is different from French, albeit both being Romance language. On further thought, it has to be different: French has three sets of articles, definite, indefinite, and partitive, while Portuguese (as English) has only definite and indefinite articles. Portuguese expresses the French idea of partitive by an "article 0" (though by no means this is the only use of the absence of an article). Colloquially: 

English does have that verb which is etymologically related to the Swedish heter, Icelandic heiti, German heißen, etc. In English it is to hight, only it is archaic, still sometimes it is used nowadays, mostly in poetry, for example in the 1943 poem I hight Don Quixote, I live on peyote by John Whiteside “Jack” Parsons, or in the name of the modern punk rock song Toni-I-Hight by the band The Arrivals. 

That is the Westertoren Tower in Amsterdam, the Nederlands. The numbers are regular Roman numerals, but written in a fancy way. The first one is what looks like , but that is how , 1000, is written, with a tall middle mast. The second one is , but that is actually , 500, again, with a tall mast. Then go the usual Roman , 100, and , 37, which should all be summed up, making 1000 + 500 + 100 + 37 = 1637, and that is the year written on the Westertoren Tower. 

It has no common meaning. Margarita is a Roman name, that word meant 'pearl' in Latin. Martin is also a Roman name, it comes from 'Mars', the name of the god of war. Maria is derived from the Hebrew name 'Miriam' (from the Ancient Egyptian 'beloved'), but later it combined with the Latin name 'Maria' which was the feminine form of 'Marius', both words probably derived from the Latin 'mare' - 'sea'. The Latin 'margarita' - 'pearl' - is a borrowing through Greek from a Middle Eastern language, perhaps from Middle Persian, but it's impossible to say for sure, since every Middle Eastern language seems to have that word to mean 'pearl'. 

As others have pointed out, the evolution, both in Latin/Romance and in Old/Modern English is contrarywise. The old masculine word (wer, vir) went extinct or archaic or suffered a semantic shift (Portuguese varão, male person, only used in literary register, but also barão, baron; English were, male person, now extinct); the old neutral word (homo, man) shifted to mean just male person except, but even this is going obsolete, in an abstract sense, as the name of the species) and was replaced by the Latin (grammatically feminine) word (personna -> English person, Portuguese (still grammatically feminine) pessoa), while the feminine word was kept (wyfman -> woman or replaced by euphemisms, neologisms or, like in French, just by the word for female (It. donna, Pt. mulher, Fr. femme). I suppose that this evolution is similar in English and Romance rather due to coincidence than out of some universal linguistic pattern, though my ignorance of anything beyond the already mentioned languages makes it impossible for me to demonstrate. But there are, or so I am told, languages completely devoid of gender, such as Japanese, Hungarian or Turkish, so it cannot be completely universal. In Romance languages, anyway, the whole masculine and neutral genders of Latin collapsed into what is called the masculine gender, but is perhaps closer to Latin's neutral. Also, there is some confusion between semantics and grammar almost always when speakers of English try to understand gender in other languages: a word can be grammatically of one gender, but semantically refer to something of the opposite sex - or with no sex at all. And such confusion tends to get politicised in English, with misguided attempts to root patriarchy into linguistic features of modern European languages, usually through anachronisms or false etymologies. 

They were standardized at some point, in the 19th-20th centuries, but many languages still keep their own ancient punctuation, e.g. the Armenian period is , the Armenian question mark is which is put above the last vowel letter of the question word, the Greek question mark is , Spanish uses the upside-down question mark at the beginning of interrogative sentences ( 'What?'), the same with the exclamation mark ( 'Hi!'). Japanese has specific punctuation, the period is . Amharic keeps the ancient Ge'ez punctuation, but it gets outdated now and often substituted with the European-style one. Many Asian scripts of Indian origin, e.g. Javanese, still keep their traditional punctuation. 

I think, the accent with which the narrator speaks in Frank Zappa's rock opera "Thing-Fish" is an example of a constructed English accent/dialect. Correct me, if I'm wrong, and that's a real dialect spoken somewhere, but I've never heard anything like that. The narrator says ['lembəˌtɔːriːz] for 'laboratories', ['pouʃəm] and [sə'luʃəm] for 'potion' and 'solution', [ˈgʌbnɪnt] for 'government', ['boɪdən] for 'burden', [mu'zɪʃnɪnz] for 'musicians', [rə'lɪdʒməs] for 'religious', and ['ʙɔːdweɪ] for 'Broadway' ([ʙ] is a voiced bilabial trill). Also, every [ð] is [d] and every [θ] is [t], there are also some grammar deviations. Here it is, the narrator begins speaking from the very first seconds: $URL$ 

[1]Albeit the more formal ele é falecido - "he is dead", or more properly "he is deceased" takes ser, as it should be, not estar 

Since the context is informal, they may call each other informal pronouns (você and its popular contraction cê). It would be more respectful of both to use formal pronouns, but it is optional. On the other hand, the use of formal pronouns in informal contexts may be intended as sarcastic, as in parents calling their children o senhor during reprimands (and so, depending on context, the usage can easily be perceived as less respectful than the use of an informal pronoun). Also, archaic usage often sounds formal to our ears, even though it was intended as informal at the time it was uttered. We tend to hear English "thou" as formal because it is in the Bible and nobody speaks like that anymore; but it was informal, as opposed to formal "you", a few centuries ago. 

The word "dialect" is unfortunate, because it means different things in speakers different, oh, ah, hum, "dialects". In the good old times, it used to mean a kind of "sub-language" or "quasi-language" - what was described, with some wit, as "a language without an army and a navy". In that sence, Venetian, or Hunsruekisch, are "dialects". More recently, and more politically correctly, in our troubled times when it is deemed improper to talk about some facts of life, including navies and armies, "dialect" came to mean any variant of a given language. The former definition became badmouthed for being "extra-linguistic" - but unfortunately the word dialect is still applied to things such as Pommersch or Neapolitan, while now being used also for very different phenomena, such as AAVE, the Portuguese spoken in Rio de Janeiro, the several non-standard varieties of any given language, slang, professional jargons, etc, etc, etc. So, is it possible to say that "Venetian is a dialect", and that, being a dialect, it is "inferior to Standard Italian"? Well, there would be a problem here; after all, "Italian" is just "Tuscan dialect" upgraded to national language through a political decision. If other factors had prevailed, perhaps the newly unified Kingdom of Italy would have chosen Sardinian, or Sicilian, or Piedmontese, as its national language, and now we would speak of Tuscan as a "dialect". So, both languages, Venetian and Tuscan/Italian were "born equal". But the fact is, the Italian State machinery is run in Italian, not in Venetian, Calabrian or Friulian. And this introduces a deep inequality between Italian in the one hand, and the other languages of Italy in the other, because the State, albeit being "extra-linguistic" in the sense it is meant when we say that the difference between language and dialect is "extra-linguistic", is a very powerful glossopoietic entity, that "produces language" everyday - especially through its courts and academic institutions, but also, even if less decisively, through its army and navy. This gives the standard language a decisive, if unfair, advantage against dialects such as Venetian or Hunsruekisch: the State speaks Standard Italian or Standard German, and if you want, or need, to communicate with the State, you will have to do it through the appropriate national Standard. In this precise sense, Standard Italian is "superior" to any other language of Italy: it is the language that is taught in schools, that you need to know to read the national press, to listen to TV, to demand in court, to write your doctoral thesis... and to properly communicate with your sargeant, nevermind if you are a footsoldier or a captain or general. But I suppose you are asking about "dialects" in the more modern meaning. Is Standard English "superior" to cockney, or AAVE? Or is Standard English "correct" English, while the other variants are "wrong" English, or perhaps different languages? I would say no. Those variants are part of a same language, English, and they serve different purposes. You don't write a dissertation in cockney, but you also don't address your buddies at the bar (or your family at home) in Standard English. You use different "registers" of the English language, some more formal, some more informal. The informal registers tend to vary more geography-wise than the standards, but that doesn't make the English spoken in Pennsylvania a different language than the English spoken in South New Wales (though, of course, if given a few centuries more, they very weel might evolve into exactly this, and become mutually incomprehensible). A traditional, prescriptive, point-of-view is that the standard is the only "correct" language. This is the reason people look at constructions like "it ain't true" and say they are "wrong". They do not conform to standard grammar, or standar lexic, or both. And since the standard is the only variant that is studied in school, and consequently, the only whose rules are aprehended consciously, people tend to imagine that the standard "conforms to the rules of language", while informal variants are like the Old Far West, a territory of lawlessness. But this is false; the speech of the prostitutes or the teamsters is not less regulated by rules than the English of the Queen - they are just different rules, quite probably not even less strict than those of Standard English, and those rules are not taught or even studied in the same depth as stardard rules are. So, there are sentences that do not follow the rules of Standard English, but the rules of other variants of English. Those are "wrong" only if your intention was to speak or write Standard English. If used in an informal social context, they are probably correct. The opposite is also true: to speak among friends like you were in court or parliament will result in you being told to stop; they probably won't tell you you are speaking "wrong" English, but the effect is the same: to enforce the rules that are contextually correct. But there are also sentences that do not follow the rules of Standard English, nor the rules of any other variant. Those would be wrong English by any measure. 

In the Bantu languages, like Swahili, there are also noun classes, but they are more numerous than in Archi (14 of them in Swahili), and the Swahili verbs are marked for the class of the subject, too. 

The language is always excessive, that is, it helps to understand the speech in several ways at the same time ­- there are other words that create the context, there is the grammar an the syntax of the sentence that help us understand the exact meaning of the words we hear and not to mix them up with their homonyms, also many languages, like English, have lots of dissimilative spellings that, again, help us to see which homonym is used, e. g. whole or hole, write or right or rite, etc. And when people speak, we can read the lips of the speaker which also greatly helps in understanding, since many consonants sound really very similar. Now imagine, when the radio appeared, you could now hear a person without seeing him or her, and when the words were spelled letter-after-letter, almost all that excessive features were gone, not to say about the quality of the sound on the radio (and even very often on the modern phones), so that 1898 spelling alphabet was created so as to add more excessiness to the names of the letters. Also, there's such thing as McGurk effect that shows how little is needed to make us hear a sound absolutely different from the one that was pronounced. Here's a great BBC video (3 minutes) that demonstrates the McGurk effect, watch it and you will see what I mean: $URL$ 

To take into account the comments below, Spanish Alemaña derives from Latin Alemannia, either through Frankish -> Old French -> Spanish or through Frankish -> Iberian Romance -> Spanish. The Arabic word must be a borrowing from Iberian Romance or Spanish (because a literate borrowing from Latin would result in word similar to Germania, which was the Classic Latin most common name for the region and its people), and the Turkish word must be a borrowing from Arabic (because if they acquired the word via Eastern Europe instead, they would most likely borrow from either German Deustcheland, Greek Γερμανία, or some slavic language, in which case it would ressemble something like Njemačka). 

This sentence is quite unfortunate; it is too innovative for those who want to keep the standard, and too conservative for those who want it to change. Plus it poses a problem: "Nós" requires the predicative to go into the plural (nós... velhos). But the singular verb, "está", requires the predicative in the singular, so it is hard for speakers to decide whether it should be "nós está ficando velho" or "nós está ficando velhos". Probably due to such inconsistency, nowadays this sentence would be rejected as agrammatical by most speakers in both standard and colloquial registers. It can only be considered acceptable in the popular register - but then it has to get the verb changed, too: "nós tá ficando velho" (or "ficando véio"). And here is a "Piltdown fossil" of this evolutionary process, ie, a hypercorrection: 

In the monumental Old Turkic Dictionary ("Древнетюркский словарь", Наука, Л., 1969) it is written that Kent/Kənd is really of the Sogdian origin. The dictionary reflects the words found in the Turkic written records of the 7th - 13th centuries. The word Kent is not there, but the word Kend redirects to Känd, to page 290, and here is the screenshot of the Känd (city) entry. Notice the remark "[согд. k'nδ] after the headword," 'согд.' means 'Sogdian': 

The two words are, actually, and . They are derived from the triliteral root k-s-f (kāf-sīn-fā, ك س ف) with the general meaning of "fragments, pieces, lumps, to shatter, to make into fragments". Both words are indefinite singular masculine nouns in the Accusative Case. The case ending, tanwīn fatḥ over the letter alif (ـًا‎) is an obvious sign the nouns are singular. Still, the second noun, , can be used as a collective noun, it can be translated like "a piece", "(in) pieces", "a fragment", "fragments". The first noun, , is "a portion", "a part", "a fragment". As for looking up words in Arabic dictionaries, you must find out their root first. It is easy with triliteral roots like in these words, but when the root contains y or w, those consonants can disappear in some forms, which makes looking up such words a bit more difficult. In Lane's Lexicon our root k-s-f is not found, it must be on this page of volume 7, and it is there, in the lower left corner, but without any translation, "See Supplement" is only written there. In the supplement, which is in the end of volume 8, there is again a reference (in the center of the page) to still another word (بال), its root is b-w-l with the w disappearing, it is here, but there is nothing interesting about k-s-f in that article. 

As pointed in other answer, starboard comes from Middle English sterbord. What wasn't pointed is that that would mean "steerboard" - the side of the steerwheel, relative to pilot of a ship, as opposed to "backboard". So, Spanish estribor (like French tribord, Italian stribordo, Portuguese estibordo) is a loan from some Germanic language, not the other way round. 

Is it usual to describe "not talking rough" as "hypercorrect grammar"? I wouldn't, because to me "hypercorrection" is a different thing, and is not "correct" at all, much less "more than correct". Those two claims seem to me to be the same, though. In this case, even if there was a difference, the visible trend for the last half century is not that men are growing more polite and quitting talking rough, but that women are definitely getting less polite, and increasingly speaking rough more often. 

Portuguese certainly has triphtongs: Paraguai - /para'gwai/ luau - /lwaw/ Since the former is an import from Tupi-Guarani via Castillian, I would assume that Castillian has triphtogs too (I would not assume that of Tupi-Guarani because the /gw/ probably originates in a glotal stop, /para'ʔajʔ/). Isn't "why" an example of a Standard English triphtong, /hwaj/? Or what we call tritongos in Portuguese is not the same as what you call triphtongs? 

First, diacritics are used in English, in borrowed words, sometimes optionally (like in the words café ~ cafe, façade ~ facade), but sometimes there is no alternative spelling without diacritics (like Übermensch). Diacritics and ligatures can be used in foreign names, like Æneas Mackay. Here is a list of English words with diacritics. In Asia and especially in Africa where most of the languages use Latin alphabet, there are several languages that do not use any diacritics or special letters. Here is a list of some of them: Asia 

As for [ɔə], to write it another diacritic sign is used, sanhyoŭk sannha (័), its o-series pronunciation becomes [ɔə] before final (silent) r.
