He was probably lucky that he managed to surrender to the British (strictly speaking he claimed political asylum) rather than the Prussians. Even then he had a number of political supporters in Britain that thought imprisonment was a bit severe! 

Those are all facts about its construction. The pyramids at Gisa are aligned pretty accurately north, if you are building something that big and you don't have theodolites and RTK-GPS then having a fixed star to aim at is a very easy way to get the sides parallel. If there is/was any religous significance to the Pole star I suspect it was invented by the royal surveyors. The golden ration comes from using a survey wheel. If you lay out a line by rolling a wheel a certain number of times, and then set a height by stacking the same wheel vertically you get an angle of 51 deg or 43 degrees (depending on how many high). Then the geometry of circles gives you pi and the golden ration without you every having to calculate it. They also knew that a 3:4:5 triangle gave a right angle (since 5^2 = 4^2 = 3^2 ) but didn't know about Pythagoras theorem in general 

Noble prisoners captured by other nobles would be held by them - in the proper manner- which frequently got so long and expensive the nobleman lost out on the deal. Since ultimately they belonged to the king, who in the 15th Century would be leading the army in the field, the noble would have to pay a fee to the king to keep them - essentially a cut. Or they would sell the prisoner on up the chain either for a cut of the ransom or for advancement. Because of the nature of warfare in this era a commoner was unlikely to capture a high ranking noble, knights sought out and fought other knights. Agincourt is an exception in that most of the French nobility were slaughtered in the mud by common soldiers and archers. There are a bunch of interesting brothers-in-arms contracts from the 100years war where people agreed beforehand to partner in capturing prisoners and guaranteed to pay a certain part of any ransom for each other. They read almost like car insurance deals. Juliet Barker has a couple of very accessible books on the era Conquest and Agincourt 

In the case of Conway (and most other places on borders) - it's more a castle than a town. There is no point in having a well fortified castle, if around it you have an undefended town to give your attackers a base to live in while they attack you. The walled part of the city is really just the first line of castle defence for a siege. Conway s part of the English king Edward's attempt to subdue the Welsh and was regularly, and occasionally successfully, attacked. Other walled towns in France and Italy are there because there wasn't a strong central government and each town was either constantly at war with the others, or was at risk from wandering bands of mercenary armies. At the first sign of a serious attack you round up all the animals and food into the town (and the farmers if you are feeling generous) burn all the fields and farms and wait for the attacking army to die of exposure,starvation and dysentry. 

By the time of the Napoleonic wars the odds seem to be on the side of the infantry and their rifles. Although cavalry were effective against a marching column and were lethal against a retreating army, once the infantry could form squares on a battlefield they were pretty much safe. IIRC none of the British squares at waterloo were penetrated by French cavalry and concentrated organised rifle fire from a square could stop a cavalry charge. When you consider transporting and feeding a horse in a campaign they probably cost the equivalent of a squad of a dozen infantry so overall probably a net loss 

"armour" is a bit general, from the fancy gleaming best tournement suit to the few bits of salvaged chain mail stitched onto an archers leather jacket. Generally the knights and foot soldiers wouldn't march in anything like full armour, medieval battles were fought on agreed sites when the armies were visible to each other - not ambushes or blitzkreig. So generally you would have a couple of days notice to get your armour on, sharpen your sword and say mass (all equally important to a knight) Harald Hadrada famously was killed at the battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 because he had left his favourite chain mail (called emma!) on the ship for safety. Henry V did order his troops to be in armour for the march from Honfluer to Calais because he did expect an attack at any time from the French and didn't have enough spare scouts or local help to spot an attacking force. You keep the armour clean with lots of elbow-grease. Squires spent a lot of time cleaning armour, which if you had been fighting in the mud alongside a lot of scared men and scared horses wouldn't have been a pleasant job! If you get the metal clean quickly it won't rust. chain mail was cleaned by rolling it in a barrel of sand. Where do you get barrels of sand on a march? Presumably the supply train contained forges, tools, spare parts, and barrels for rent. At least late medieval armour steel was 'blued' - you quench the finished steel in oil which coats the surface and protects it. I don't know how long working armour lasted - presumably it depended on how much fighting it's owner did and how scrupulous his squire was. The suits you see in museums and on tombs were special sunday-best sets for show. 

A lot of the records were lost when the Dublin Public Record Office was blown up in 1922. But see $URL$ 

For Germany it was unnecessary, they weren't going to be a threat and would be a useless ally. Occupying Spain even under friendly terms would cost men and equipement. Essentially the same as Vichy France. With Italy and France you already have all the Mediterranean bases you need. The North Atlantic convoy routes are further away from Spain than bases in France and you have further to move supplies from Germany. At the time the railways in France and Spain didn't match so it would be difficult to move large amounts of fuel/weapons/parts overland and shipping them means taking them through the English channel ! For the allies it's a long way to go to land an invasion force and then you have to get them accross the full length of a hostile country before crossing a mountain range and then having another hostile country (France) to get across. It's very easy to bottle up a army in the Iberian peninsular - as Wellington found. 

Not exactly an expert but I don't think the two religions can be more dis-similar. Zoroastria is a revealed religion, it has a distinct founder and prophet who historically existed (although whether really a prophet is another question). It's a monotheistic religion - arguably the first. Hinduism is a collection of much older (potentially several millenia older) local religions with no original prophet or founder none to history. The rituals, commandments and activities of most religions end up being pretty similar - there are only so many natural forces you can attribute to a god and the laws you need to live peacefully in a city have been pretty much the same for the last 10,000 years. 

Simple answer - it's complicated! The world was very different in 1776 than it was in 1867 or 1900. The US war of independance followed the movement/ideas that led to the French revolution and was a real political/philosophical difference in how you should run a country. It was also concentrated in a few large cities with a large established political class. At the same time Canada, NZ and Australia were much more sparsely populated by people who were mostly much newer immigrants and still thought of themselves as British so there was no real 'independence' movement. The formation of these three into separate countries was a much more gentle gradual process and generally fairly peaceful. I think there was a genuine feeling that their economies, population etc was big enough to stand on their own and there was no legitimate reason to stop them - better as friendly 'cousins' than prisoners. India, the remaining bits of Africa and the Caribbean following WWII was more a combination of, "we can't afford them", "we just fought a war for freedom we can't really justify our own Reich" and the Bomb+Cold war makes the empire pretty irrelevant anyway. 

When do you mean? Up until 1867 it was British - and you could make a reasonable argument that geopoliticaly it was pretty much British until after WWII. Really, the Suez crisis marks the beginning of a separate Canadian foreign policy. In the cold war it was/is a strong US/Nato ally. It's not really big enough in population terms or political will to be a major player and it's location is too strategically important to remain neutral. Post cold war, it shifts with the politics of it's ruling party and the US presidency. Why it didn't throw off the imperial yoke in the 18/19C and become a global superpower to challenge Britain and the emerging US? Well that would have been rude. 

When the chimney became popular, 12C for castles and high status buildings, 15-16century for regular houses. Without a chimney you have a central hearth and the smoke rises to vents in the eaves, so everybody who wants to be warm has to be in the large single room. Once chmineys are invented you need somewhere to build them. If you have a castle you can put them in the thick stone walls, if you have a house then you need to build a chimney from scratch out of stone. The obvious place to build it is where you have always had the fire, especially since the walls of the house are made of flammable wattle and daub, ie in the middle of the room. Now you have a massive stone structure in the centre with a fireplace in both sides it makes sense to continue the walls to divide up the space and use the stonework as the support for upper floors. 

At the time? Because either their economies and population didn't support it or were much much more interlinked with England's. Ireland is a bit of a special case - there were political/religious reasons for it being independent which overrode other concerns 

$URL$ has a very good description. Ptolemy suggested mapping a spherical earth with lines of longitude/latitude but didn't do very much field work. There are Arabic maps from C9-C10 which used astronomical observations to get their important cities in the right place. The maps from 1500 are essentially correct: 

Can we think of any reason why a major American Holywood motion picture would wish to distance it's hero from Islam? Most of his portrayal in 'literature' is from Walter Scott and the Victorians which tells you a lot more about their attitudes to themselves and what they saw as important values than it does about an actual medieval Islamic ruler
