Complely non-science based answer (due to a lack of being able to come up with a science-based way anything could draw nutrients of gems): Make your dragons a silicon-based life-form. Biological creatures need organic matter, a mineral based creature would eat minerals (note: this is not how actual, exobiological silicon-based life would work!) They extract crystalline molecules from gems to create their "flesh" and "bones"; they consume coal, oil, and wood to fuel the fires which are an important part of their digestive furnace, in addition to allowing them to breath flame. Probably will also use rocks as "grist", if the digestive system both grinds and heats. They could excrete a crumbly mixture of sand and ash, all that's left after they've absorbed everything they need from the minerals. 

The second question is more important than the first. If the important thing about history is considered to be the story, the theme, and the lessons to be learned, then the actual facts of the history would begin to be forgotten after four or five generations for an oral culture, or more slowly starting a few generations later for a written culture. Contrarily, if the emphasis is on factual recollection, then even a culture with an oral history would likely remember those facts for centuries, a written culture for millennia. 

All multi-cellular life as we know it is composed or eukarotic cells -- cells with a nucleus. Some single-celled organisms are eukarotic, some are prokaryotic (cells without a nucleus, such as bacteria.) Brief research indicates that prokaryotic multicellular life would be unlikely. But would some other form of non-eukarotic, but non-microscopic life be possible? If so, do we have any way of guessing what it's biochemestry might be like? 

It would make low-tech navigation immensely easier, which would likely result in more exploration / trade / conquest over wider areas happening sooner. The ring would give a clear east-west axis, and you could infer the north-south axis as perpendicular to it. You could infer latitude based on it's position and width. The most difficult part of low-tech navigation is longitude. If the ring were fully uniform, then it wouldn't help with that. But if there were any stable irregularities to use for reference, that would allow one to infer longitude as will. 

I'm not aware of any ships that can cross oceans at the desired speed, which implies that only those who can fly over the atlantic / pacific oceans will survive. And then, fuel will be an issue -- that many airplanes trying to make the same trans-oceanic journey at the same time will be difficult. So, many die stuck in traffic jams, trying to head west. Many on the western coasts, and in boats off of the western coasts, overtaken. Lots of airplanes that go down in the middle of the ocean: they didn't start with enough fuel to make the full journey, and all the refueling spots have been used up by airplanes that got there faster. And when those who cross the Atlantic from Europe and Africa get to North and South America, they won't be able to refuel to cross the continent and the Pacific, because the residents of the Americas will have used all the available resources in their own attempts to head west. Similarly, if the attack continues for more than a day, those from the Americas arriving in Asia will find that they have no way of traversing the continent at the required speed. The only way to survive would be to be close enough to the poles to have considerably less distance to go, and on the ice caps, modes of transportation will be even more limited. And that solution only works if the attack stops after 24 hours -- if it's ongoing, those who survived by being close enough to the ice-caps to keep moving would starve. In other words, in your scenario, humanity would be screwed. What if they had time to plan and prepare? Well, I think we'd last a little longer, but not for long. There is no way around the fact that traveling around the globe in 24 hours, regardless of method, will require a LOT of fuel. We'd need to set up robotic fuel extraction, production, transportation, and refueling stations, so this work would continue while humans were elsewhere. This would also require global cooperation to be sustainable, and maintenance would be difficult. Ditto with food. Even if we have custom boats/planes/vehicles fitted with hydroponics labs, they will need a consistent supply of fertilizer in order to stay viable. So, even with time to prepare, humanity would be screwed. I'm just not able to come up with a way that your scenario would be survivable. If it lasted only 24 hours, then there might be a few dozen survivors near the poles, and a few thousand from the Americas stranded in Asia and Australia. Longer? Everybody's dead, Dave. 

GoVisually is a possibility. You can mark annotations and place comments on any part of your project, and there is this pretty cool feature where you can click on each user and it will hide or display relevant content, so if you think some user is just trolling around you can ban him. Revisions can also be easily upload and it's simple to switch between different versions of the same document or project. And I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's still free. Here's a promotional video I found on google: Video 

I've seen multiple posts on destroying the Earth, but is it possible for humans to reverse the spin of Earth? In order words, considering modern technology at our disposal, is it possible for human beings to band together to reverse the spin of Earth? In addition, considering how much energy is required to do so, what if reversing the spin of Earth became the most important thing in our daily lives? A.k.a. all the money, all the governments working together. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on how to improve this question, or how to answer. Thanks in advance! 

The United States of America has 50 states and 14 territories (according to Google). In my story, each state is drawn far apart from each other due to conflicting interests. If all 50 states + 14 territories went to war against each other, which state would win? Conditions: I am talking about militaristic winning. The exact details, I'm not sure. I would prefer it to be conquering all other states, but I'm not sure if that is entirely possible. Time Period: Current Methods of fighting: Everything each state has, EXCEPT for nuclear war. So states with nuclear missiles would NOT have an advantage. Could you guys include specific details and facts? Thanks :D 

Bullets A machine gun that fires rubber bullets at high speeds would be enough to stop organisms from physically boarding the ship, unless their armor is as strong as the ship's hull. If it isn't, just increase the mass or speed of the bullets. Nets and Rope: Or, if there are few organisms approaching your ship, like maybe one or two, Nets and Rope would work. Keep it like the old times :P Light Blinding light (which wouldn't damage the ship) could also be useful. Considering that the outer hull of the ship should be resistant to the sun's rays, you could mount a high intensity light ray gun on the outside, aimed to blast anything coming near. Worse case, it hits your own ship, but then again, your ship is resistant to the sun's rays. Magnets You have magnets? Okay then. Create an entry way into your ship that combatants must travel through. Possibly a tunnel or something of the sort. Cap the ends of the tunnel with very magnetic magnets. They come barging in? Release the magnets and squish 'em. How to prevent a Mutiny: You said that all personnel wear magnetic boots? Well, make the floor an electromagnet, and if your crew mutiny's, just turn on the electromagnet and poof, they're all stuck to the ground. Does this help? Any questions? 

I'll put a few points here as to why this kind of spaceship (minus some of your requirements) will be able to exist with our current laws of physics but not be able to exist with our current technology (or any technology in the near future, anyways). 1) The energy required to accelerate a mass $m$ to $0.32c$. (Also as a minor point, dealing with a constant speed is pretty easy as the spaceship at constant speed is basically an inertial reference frame. I'll deal with the logistics of this later $$E=mc^2(γ-1)$$ where $$γ=1/\sqrt{1−v^2/c^2}.$$ Assuming that each room for a passenger weights approximately $400 kg$ (a.k.a a small car minus the engine and mainframe) and that there are $9000$ passengers, the total weight of structure one is a MINIMUM of $3,600,000$ or $3.5 \cdot 10^6kg$. And this is just structure 1. 

For structure 2, you say that you want a $900 km$ shell. I have absolutely no idea what you want inside it or how much it should weigh, so I am going to assume that it is an empty metal shell made of aluminum foil :). I'll make it approximately $1m$ thick which...if you want to know, would explode due to differences in air pressure in space. Note that this is all smaller than the actual measurements because I'm proving that it's going to take A LOT of energy. This would be a total of $$W = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h \cdot \rho \\= 450000m^2\cdot \pi\cdot 4\cdot 1m\cdot 2700kg/m^3 \\= 6870663133400878 kg \approx 10^{15} kg$$.
