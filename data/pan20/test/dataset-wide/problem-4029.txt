The property $∀x:x≤f(x)$ is also called „extensive“, especially with respect to closure systems or lattices. In general, a closure system is defined as the image of a closure operator, which is an idempotent and extensional endomorphism of an ordered set. 

Provable facts Statement 1 If $≤$ is a linear order then $(G,∙,≤)$ is a right ordered group. Suppose that for some $x,y,z∈G$, $x≠y$ the conditions $x≤y$ and $xz\not≤yz$ are true. The latter can be rewritten to $yz≤xz$ as $≤$ is a linear order. Then we know that either $xy^{-1}≤1$ or $1≤xy^{-1}$ is true. Multiplying the latter with $y$ leads to $y≤x$ which is a contradiction to $x≠y$. Thus we know $xy^{-1}≤1$. Multiplying this inequality from the right side with $yz$ leads to $xz≤yz$. Thus $(G,∙,≤)$ is right ordered. A remark to 2) from Boris' answer: An arbitrary order extension may change global properties, such as being a right partially ordered group. In fact a linear order defines that also those elements must be comparable with $1$ that have been incomparable. Thus, there are many ways to violate Xodaraps conditions. Statement 2 If $≤$ is the intersection of linear orders that fulfil Xodaraps conditions then $(G,∙,≤)$ is a right partially ordered group. By Statement 1 each linear order is a right ordered group. If $x≤y$ holds, then this condition is true in all of the other linear order extensions. Then in all of these extensions we get $xz≤yz$, thus this inequality is preserved by the intersection. Other remarks Searching the internet after “right lattice ordered groups” reveals some articles about “half lattice ordered groups”. This looks very promising in order to find an example of a group that fulfils the conditions but is not an $\ell$-group. The terms “partially ordered” and “ordered” are used synonymous as well as “linearly ordered” and “ordered”, depending on the focus of the author and context. 

As the comments point out there is no general algorithm to enumerate possibly exponentially many isomorphisms. Nevertheless, you can enumerate the isomorphisms in polynomial delay, which means that the time spent between two outputs is polynomial in the size of the graph. A rough estimation can be done using the following algorithm to find all isomorphisms from graph $A$ to graph $B$: Preparation: Enumerate all nodes with numbers from $1$ to $n$ and assign for each node a Graph $G_i$ that is a circle with $n+1$ nodes and has $i$ spikes (additional nodes that are directly connected to the circle. Thus these graphs $G_i$ are paiwise nonisomorphic. For each $G_i$ mark a connecting node. We mark a node in graph $A$ or $B$ by connecting this node to the connecting node of $G_i$. As we use two copies of $G_i$ (one for $A$ and one for $B$) we denote them with $G_i^A$ and $G_i^B$. If every node of $A$ is marked by a distinct graph $G_i^A$ and every node of $B$ is marked by a distinct graph $G_i^B$ these graphs are planar as $G_i^J$ is planar and connected by only one edge. Each of these graphs has $O(n^2)$ nodes. Thus, checking if they are isomorphic is polynomial in the size of $A$. Enumeration: 

An N-subset $\{x_1,\dots,x_N\}$ of a compact set $X\subset \mathbb R^d$ is called a set of Fekete points (named after Michael Fekete) if it maximizes the product $$\prod_{1\le k<j\le N}|x_k-x_j|\qquad (1)$$ among all such $N$-tuples. When $X\subset \mathbb C$, one can express this product in terms of the Vandermonde determinant. In this case Fekete points are of particular interest in approximation theory (as interpolation nodes). Generally, they have no explicit form and must be found numerically. But there are exceptions. When $X$ is a circle, Fekete points are equally spaced. This is well-known and can be proved like this: we may assume $x_k=\exp(i\theta_k)$ with $0=\theta_1<\theta_2<\dots <\theta_N<2\pi$. For a fixed integer $m$, $1\le m\le \lfloor N/2 \rfloor$, consider the product $\Pi(m)=\prod_{k=1}^N|x_{k+m}-x_{k}|$ with indices taken mod $N$. Since each point $x_k$ appears in just two terms of this product, it is not hard to see that $\Pi(m)$ is maximal when $x_k$ are equally spaced. (Indeed, $\log \sin$ is a concave function.) Now let $X$ be the union of two concentric circles of radii $r$ and $R$. Assume that $N=2n$ is even and that exactly $n$ of the points lie on each circle. With this additional assumption we are not quite in the Fekete problem anymore, but we have an obvious candidate for the maximum - 

The ultimate sparseness occurs when $Ax^*(\lambda)=0$, which is the case when the minimizer $x^*$ is the projection of $b$ onto $\ker A$. For this to happen, $\lambda$ must be small enough so that the restriction of $A$ to the orthogonal complement of its kernel is bounded from below by a constant greater than $2\lambda \mathrm{dist}(b,\ker A)$. Here the lower bound for operator is understood in the $\ell^2\to\ell^1$ norm. 

Men'shov proved in 1936 that if $f\colon D\to\mathbb C$ is continuous and approximately differentiable outside of a countable set, then it is holomorphic in $D$ 1 (Russian original with French summary). In the same paper he gives an example, attributed to Lusin, which shows that continuity cannot be dropped entirely even if the function is approximately differentiable at every point. Let $\varphi\colon\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ be an entire function that tends to $0$ as $z\to\infty$ within any sector $\{|\arg z|<\pi-\epsilon\}$ (approximation theory can be used to create such examples). Then $f(z)=z\varphi(1/z)$ has an approximate derivative everywhere in $\mathbb C$, but of course it is not differentiable or even continuous at $0$. Men'shov asked if continuity can be replaced with boundedness. This was answered affirmatively by Telyakovskii 50 years later 2. In fact, boundedness can be weakened to logarithmic integrability. Brodovich 3 proved that an injective function with an approximate derivative at every point is holomorphic. (MR review omits the injectivity assumption). A survey of results in this area was written by Dolzhenko 4, but it predates the work of Brodovich. 

The isomorphism is encoded by the permutation of the marker graphs $G_i$. The procedure goes into recursion only, if the marked graphs are still isomorphic. Thus, an isomorphism is found whenever the largest depth of recursion is reached. At each level of recursion at most $n$ graph isomorphy tests are performed. As we have $n$ levels, the delay between the outputs of two isomorphisms is about $O(n^2)$ times the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem of the marked graph, which is polynomial as shown above. Note: There are much more effective ways of marking the nodes than in this example. Edit: It is easy to see that a polynomial delay algorithm is polynomial iff its output is polynomial. 

I think the answer to Question 1 is yes, at least for finite graphs. Lets $(T,E)$ be a graph. You can choose a group $G$ that is large enough to do the following: For each node $x∈V$ choose a subgroup $G_x$ (called stabilizer) such that the intersection of all subgroups is $\{1\}$ and each subgroup has a different cardinality. Then you can form the graph in the following way: $$ V= \dot\bigcup_{t∈T} \{gG_t\mid g∈G\}, \mbox{ and } F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}.$$ Then each node $t$ is broken up into $|G/G_t|$ pairwise unconnected nodes. And each edge is split up into a complete bipartite graph connecting all equivalent vertices. By changing the group size and the size of the stabilizer you can ensure that any two edges in $F$ have the same valency iff they belong to the same node in $T$. For more information: 

This is still not the system you are talking about, as you forbid non-proper subsets and loops must be considered separately. But this may be a starting point. If you are interested in more insights you could investigate the problem with tools similar to formal concept analysis. You can consider $(2^Γ,Γ,J)$ where $⟨V,≤⟩\mathrel J G :⇔ G\cong ⟨V,≤⟩$ as some kind of formal context. As far as I know Sebastian Kerkhoff recently developed a categorical generalisation of that framework. BTW.: You are talking about a category. Thus, maybe category theory has additional results. Edit: And that it doesn't get lost: The problem of loops is not touched by the question whether it is a strict or reflexive preorder. As the category of graphs with a loop on each node is equivalent to the category of graphs with no loop on any node (removing all nodes is a functor and adding a loop to each node is its inverse, their combination is the identity functor). Using a reflexive order considered as small catgeory each loop can be represented as non-identity loop, which turns the induced subcategory of this node into a non-trivial semigroup. So we can see: Two equivalent Graphs are either isomorphic or have injective endomporphsms. The latter means the corresponding nodes have a loop. 

Any set of values of $u$ at the vertices of $\Delta_k$ can be attained just by adding an affine function to $u$, which does not change $M[u]$. To see that the solution of your problem is not unique, consider $u(x,y)=ax^2+a^{-1}y^2+\mathrm{(affine\ terms)}$ with $a>0$. Clearly $M[u]=4$ for any $a$. On the other hand, Theorem 1.6.2 in the book The Monge-Ampère equation by C. Gutierréz states that there is a unique convex solution of $M[u]=\mu$ (with $M[u]$ properly understood) with prescribed continuous boundary values in a strictly convex domain $\Omega$. Without strict convexity we can't allow arbitrary continuous boundary data; it must be at least consistent with some convex function in $\Omega$. (But I don't know if that's enough). The uniqueness part holds without strict convexity; see Corollary 1.4.7 in the same book. 

Maybe if you allow an exceptional set, as in "For every $x$ outside of some meagre set, there is a $\delta>0$ such that $B(x,\delta)$ is contained in one of the $\overline{A}_n$" (Indeed, the set of all $x$ where the above fails is a closed subset of $X$ with empty interior.) 

Have you tried the method of section 8.7, i.e., solving Abel's equation $\phi(P(x))-\phi(x)=1$? Here we expect $\phi(t)=t^{-1}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_n t^n$, and you can find the coefficients of $\phi$ one by one. For example, I took $P(x)=x-x^2+x^3+x^4$ and immediately found $c_1=-2$, $c_2=-5/2$, $c_3=-7/2$, $c_4=-17/4$... Not a general formula, but you can get as many terms as you want for a given $P$. 

The minimizer $m$ is the nearest point projection of $X$ onto the subspace of $L^p$ formed by the constant functions ($p=3$ in your case). This $m$ is sometimes called the $p$-prediction or $p$-predictor of $X$. Apparently, this terminology began with Andô and Amemiya. Some of later papers are Landers and Rogge (who wrote a few other papers, e.g. this one), and Cuesta and Matrán. The term "generalized (conditional) expectation" also appeared. 

It's sometimes convenient to have different notations for "$A$ is a subset of $B$" depending on what the inclusion map does: 

Let's rephrase the problem: $(Γ,≤)$ (with $G ≤ H$ iff $G=H$ or $G < H$) is a preordered set (transitive and reflexive). $<$ is not necessarily symmetric, $≤$ is not necesserily an equivalence relation. Then $R_<$ is the set of suborders that are Elements of $Γ$. For order relations the set of the principal ideals or the set principal filters form such constructions. If I'm not mistaken in a preorder the set the principal ideals ordered by set inclusion is isomorphic to the order relation that arises if you factor out the equivalence classes. An important fact is that the induced subgraph of a preorder relation is still a preorder relation. So if $G$ is an ordered set then it is $<$ representable in the ordered set of its primary ideals. For preorders we can represent an element $x$ by a set $I(x,G)$ that contains $x∈G$ and all elements $y∈G$ that are strictly below $x$ (those $y$ such that $x≥y$ and $x\not≤y$ hold). So 

Edit: I forgot to mention that each orbit in $(V,F)$ must be connected in certain cases (e.g. considering the lattice family $M_n$ as graphs). For each node $t∈T$ choose a (connected) Cayley graph $C_t=(G/G_t,E_t)$ and add its edges to $F$ so that the above formula reads $$F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}∪⋃_{t∈T}E_t.$$ Addendum: Size estimation. Assuming the node are numbered by $1,…,n$, one way to assure that each node has different cardinality is to split each node $i$ into the circle $C_{(n+3)k^i}$. So we get an exponential upper bound. However, in many cases a much smaller size can be achieved as you have to split up only as many nodes as a minimal system of generators of the automorphism group has (split up nodes instead of linking them to copies in Daniels Answer). E.g., for the complete graph $K_n$ the nodes can be replaced by circles of length $4$ to $n+4$ leading to a total size of $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+3n$ nodes, which is polynomial. This is probably not the lower bound as it should be possible to replace certain circles by smaller Cayley graphs.
