A little of both. You can go to your local gym or outside on routes that you feel comfortable climbing and once you get a few feet above a solid bolt or bomber piece of gear, let go. Read this article on practicing falling, and this one. Since you know you're going to fall, the fall won't feel the same as a surprise lead fall, but you can learn how to relax and react. You can continue doing this on various types of climbs (slab, crack, overhang, etc.) to get the hang of falling. After some practice, try pushing your limits (safely) on a project to get over the psychological aspect of falling. If falling is all you are thinking about when you're climbing, you won't enjoy the climb and you are much more likely to actually take a fall. 

Regardless of the type of slab, avoid any prolonged contact with the rock, try to avoid getting caught on anything, and if you ever get flipped as you're falling, tuck and roll. Crack Avoid any jams that might not come out if you fall so you don't break something or get flipped. If it's a wide crack (off-width), you may need to apply the same types of techniques for falling as you would climbing slab. Overhang Avoid any jams or positions that will keep you from taking a clean fall. Watch your footwork and hands so you don't get in a position that will cause you to flip or get caught in the rope. If you're falling into a wall, relax the knees and elbows to soften the impact. 

Practice and experience. Find some safe projects to push your limits on. Climb routes you are comfortable on, but place one less piece of gear. The biggest thing is learning to trust yourself and your gear. As you lead more, you'll start to develop the right mindset for it. 

This is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. It's not uncommon for climbers to take a 60 or 70 meter rope and cut a few meters off the ends (since the ends of a rope take a lot of abuse). You can either take it to REI, as you suggested, and tell them you are cutting it for climbing or check out this how-to on Climbing.com. A few things you need to consider before cutting your rope, though. If you are planning on climbing at other crags, I would check out what the height of the routes are there and make sure you'll have enough after you cut it. If you plan on climbing anywhere else in the country, I'd suggest having at least a 50m rope (and better yet, a 60m rope) to be on the safe side. I have a 70m rope and although I don't use more than maybe 50 meters of it at a time at my regular crags, it's been the difference between safely climbing a route and not when climbing at other crags. If it's a possiblity, you should look into buying a shorter rope. I say this only because I agree that it is annoying to use a rope that is on average twice the size of what you need, but nothing is more frustrating than realizing you don't have enough rope to climb a route. 

When I was a kid I repeatedly made simple bows from hazel trees/shrubs. The main advantage here is that it grows in very handy, more or less uniformly thick branches that are very appropriate in size to use as bows (also make good walking sticks/spears). As strength/durability of the bow was never an issue we used freshly cut, green branches - obviously a no-go for any serious longbow. If the latter is what you're going for, I advise using yew or ash stems (not branches) of at least 15 cm in diameter that have been stored and dried for about 12 months. But in this case you'll need to look into some detailed manuals on bow making anyway. 

Is there anything that would make dedicated GPS devices much better at geocaching compared to smartphones? 

A couple of additional points which I think have not yet got the attention they deserve. Time is of the essence. I've once seen a report that stated that the average swimmer can make it about 50 meters max in 4°C water before drowning. That is not a lot! Meaning, that if the person in distress cannot hold on to something which helps them stay afloat you have very little time at your hands. Ice is incredibly dangerous. If the person in distress just broke through a layer of ice it will be almost impossible for them to rescue themselves, unless they have the right tools and experience (or the water is very shallow). It should also be obvious that it is very dangerous for yourself to go anywhere near the place where the ice was broken. If you cannot avoid this, try to spread out your weight, i.e. lie on your belly and spread all fours. Use whatever you can to extend your reach, such as a belt/jacket/backpack strap. 

You should keep in mind: DEET is not an insect repellent that will prevent insects from landing on your skin! DEET is a contact poison that will be very unpleasant for any insect who gets into contact with your skin - they essentially 'burn their feet'. This prevents mosquitoes/black flies/knot/... from stinging you, but they will still try to land on your skin. So you can literally take a shower in 100% DEET and not achieve your wished effect of never being bothered by a single insect. 

Maybe barbed wire fences are built differently in different parts of the world - at any rate, nobody really mentioned the way that we as kids learned to cross them safely. Crossing on top in the middle between two posts: Most often barbed wire fences are not very tightly strung, especially if they're not very new - meaning that the individual wires will have some slack to them. 

There is one very efficient trick I will call reverse chopping. (No idea if this technique has a proper name, feel free to correct my answer.) The problem with a hatchet is that it is quite light weight, so there is not a lot of force available for splitting logs. The trick here is to inverse this scenario, so that the weight of the log will work in your favor, i.e. do the splitting for you. First place a goot hit with your hatchet/axe into the center of the log (it must get firmly stuck!): 

The answers regarding flammability (and the ensuing death trap) and carbon monoxide poisoning are correct. Even in foul weather, cook outside your tent. If you do lots of camping in bad weather (New Zealand's West Coast?) get a tent with a vestibule. There is one additional problem: In bear country, you never want to cook too close to your tent, because if you and your tent and everything inside it smells of food, guess who'll be coming to visit you at night? 

I'm currently looking to buy a new tent. The old one had a floor that was said to withstand a hydrostatic head of 10000 mm, but the tents I find in the stores here go to at most 3000 mm for the floor, at least in the light-weight category. Is that still sufficient to keep me dry in Pacific Northwest weather? What about camping on snow? 

This depends of course on the tools you have and what your overall situation is. For example, if you know that you are on a certain path and you have a compass, and if you are on a slope, you can try to figure out the direction of the slope and compare that to the slopes along the path you are on using your topographic map. 

There is really only one way to determine this, and that is experience. Do a few hikes in different terrain, different settings (dayhike vs overnight), different weather and different group sizes, keep track of your time and thus build up a "library" of situations and times. Once you have a few of these reference hikes, you can then apply these to new situations. 

When abseiling from an anchor during rock climbing, I like to use a backup prusik as a potential lifesaver in case I screw up. However, I have heard different advice on where to put it, both for where to attach it to myself and where to attach it to the rope: 

Some, not all, do indeed come in two sides, and which one you use depends on the reason you use it. One of the sides strongly reflects heat. A hypothermic person therefore wants to have that reflective side on the inside so that it helps keeping any warmth inside. A person suffering from heat stroke wants the reflective side outside so that heat is kept away from that person. Note that the latter doesn't work too well, because warmth is also trapped by putting the person into the blanket in the first place. But you can use it, for example, to keep the inside of your tent colder than if you had it in the blazing sun without that reflector, similar to what people put in their windscreens in parked cars. Which side is which might depend on the manufacturer and I'd suggest reading the instructions. In one example I could find, the gold side was the heat-providing side. However, it's questionable whether those blankets are suitable for outdoor use at all, see this link 

So far I only know of Blueberries and the delicious but rare Hjortron. What (other) foods can we forage while on our trek? Btw, we won't have permits needed for hunting/fishing (nor the required skills I might add ;)). 

This really mostly serves to make sure your joints and sinews are used to being used and can bear the load - you'll likely not build up muscles this way unless you do a lot more training. 

Preservation If you have properly skinned the animal and scraped off all the bits of fat/flesh/... from the back side of the hide (see here for example) there is not really a need to further 'preserve' it except for drying it. This can be done using salt or, more likely in a survival situation, over a fire. Tanning The real issue you'll have is with tanning the hide. A simple scraped/dried hide will be stiff as a board, nothing you could make clothes or a blanket from. There are plenty of rather primitive natural ways to make a hide softer, one of the easier ones is 

They might be confident to carry bear spray because it is the better and safer option than carrying a gun. This was discussed a bunch of times on TGO already, one example of it can be found in this answer here, which cites sources claiming that bear spray shows 98% effectiveness in deterring grizzly attacks in Alaska, whereas bringing a gun did not show nearly as good results. 

Normally the stiffness should go away soon if the items are worn/used: after a short while they should be quite supple again. In very bad cases it can help to apply leather softener. This is a product which is made specifically to soften stiff/hardened leather. I get mine from my local supplier of good walking boots (there it is used to speed up the process of breaking in new leather boots). 

I have hiked the entirety of the Kungsleden, did an 11 day Sarek crossing and have also been on parts of the Nordkalottleden and the Padjelantaleden - so you could say I am fairly experienced with northern Scandinavian mountain treks. Kungsleden I did Kungsleden in 2008 - 'crowded' meant for us that we maybe saw some 5 groups of people per day, sharing camp grounds around the huts with maybe some 5 parties each night. That was on the northernmost section (Abisko southwards), which is also the most popular one. If you go towards Kvikkjok/Ammernäs it gets far less crowded, most days we maybe met some 1-2 groups of hikers. But: Kungsleden remains very very beautiful, it is easy to reach and with all the huts if something goes wrong help is never too far (i.e. maybe half a days walk). Also, while expensive, you can resupply at the huts and mountain stations, meaning that you don't need to carry as much food if you don't want to (food is heavy :P). Sarek Sarek on the other hand is quite another experience!
