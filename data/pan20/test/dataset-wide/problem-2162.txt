Given that all your team-mates do this, it is likely either triggered by something you do without knowing it, or has become a cultural norm in the team. You don't need to figure out which one to solve the problem. Back in the days of newspapers, reporters would submit a story and then editors would decide how much of it there was room for. So a 12 paragraph story might run as 12, 11, 7, 4, or even 2 paragraphs. Editors didn't have time to rearrange the story either, so it had to be written in a way that still made sense no matter how short it was cut. Lead with the important thing, then add details, any of which can be chopped. You can take this approach in meetings. Start with the conclusions - "I can do that", "it will take 3 weeks", "the client hasn't told me yet", "it's all on schedule" and then add details in bite size chunks, pausing occasionally to see if that's all your teammates need. If they then pick up the thread of the conversation, it doesn't mean they interrupted you, it just means your turn served it's purpose and now it's someone else's turn. Saving your best point or conclusion for last leaves you frustrated when your turn ends before you got to make your best point or conclusion. Turn that around and you won't mind so much when someone else starts talking. 

Here is how to respond to every performance review component that doesn't seem to be about your performance: 

I'd keep it low key, but I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. Thinking that Ford has the greatest IT team in the industry and being a proud member of that team doesn't require you to also believe that Ford makes the best cars. Enjoying the work of answering phones and signing for deliveries at Coke doesn't mean you suddenly don't prefer Pepsi (though I don't suggest drinking it at your desk.) 

Being blocked is not a good thing. While I appreciate the initiative of someone who wants to learn, to improve old code, to add tests and documentation, I generally expect these to be used to backfill small unavoidable delays, the sort that occur when a 3-day task turns out to only need 2 hours, or the client suddenly says "never mind we don't want that", or you have to wait for an expert opinion before you can code something. They shouldn't be happening all the time. That they are suggests that someone is mismanaging your time. Whoever that is, you can correct the situation yourself by making sure you ask soon enough for your next task. 

What you are saying here is that your previous employer provided a wrong (lower) salary when asked, and that they admit they were wrong. That's what your email should say. It would be a much harder email to explain why you falsified your old salary, but if you didn't you don't have a hard email to write at all. I would write something like 

Since you've already noticed that phone screens don't go well when the interviewer isn't forewarned, you have little to lose by telling them. I recommend working on a sentence to include in the email when you agree to the screen. Something like: 

If you don't get any cues like this then you won't know anyone's names anyway, so settle for "hello", "excuse me", and "good morning" and watch what they call each other. You'll figure it out pretty quickly. 

That said, ironic laughing and anger are not appropriate in the workplace, even for a large mistake. You're always ok to point out you don't like that treatment. Try to separate it from the issue of whether or not this is a big deal. Saying something like, "I'm sorry that I've made an error. Laughing at me is making me feel much worse and I don't think it's fair." For anger, "I'm not your child, and when you yell angrily at me that's how I end up feeling. Can we talk about this calmly please?" Of course, in both these cases you need to speak relatively neutrally. You can't yell "DON'T YELL AT ME LIKE THAT!" to anyone, and especially not someone you wish would stop yelling or being angry. 

Some simple examples: teaching at a gym, walking or grooming dogs, mowing lawns, helping a caterer, modelling. The pay on those is spread over a large range, but all involve being paid only for your time, and have nothing to do with your employer's business. They are also services that are often consumed at the times of the day and week that you have free. Manage them with an email address you never touch from the work network (use your phone's data plan) and you should be in a pretty defensible place. 

Generally the person wants a yes and agrees to wait. If they can't wait, they get a no. This is of course risky for you. But it is generally the truth. If it's now-or-never on accepting their offer, will you go with now? Or never? Me, I would go with never. 

And then I would stare at him for a long time. But I'm in my 50's, I have technical chops that intimidate just about everyone I meet, and I will not tolerate poisonous atmospheres any longer. I'm not suggesting this is an option available to you. You could, however, try it. Don't take on the task of rephrasing his "joke". If you are up to it, continuing to take on the task of letting him know he's inappropriate is more than enough work. Also, if you can, object in front of others. I've found the simple phrase: 

There is no way he took any action in a single day (such as going out and buying a car or transferring his children into private schools.) He didn't ramp up his spending confident in his job, or do anything else in such a short period of time. Therefore there are no consequences to your wrong information reaching him. (He felt surprised and upset for 10 minutes instead of 5?) You simply apologize, repeat that what you told him was the truth (you'd seen the list, he wasn't on it) but was apparently not correct (you hadn't seen the final list as it turns out) and then resolve to keep your mouth shut in the future. Be glad you learned on a no-harm scenario instead of when someone might spend the two weeks before the layoff spending money they would soon not have. And it might not hurt also to resolve not to ask questions like that should the tables ever be turned, now that you know you can't actually take any action based on the answer. 

In my culture [white collar North American office jobs, over 30 years old, English speaking], it is never appropriate to ask anyone their salary, ever, in public or in private. Not someone below you, not someone above you, no-one. Occasionally there are exceptions but they must always be worded carefully: 

Demanding an answer is never smart. However, providing more information certainly is. You write and say that you have received an offer (or two or however many you have received.) You also say that the company you're writing to is your first choice. Then you ask "Have you made a decision? Can I expect an offer in the next day or two?" Implied, but not stated, is that if the person says no, or if they say yes and no offer comes in the next day or two, that you will take one of the other offers. You're not saying you'll decline the others if you get one from these people, but you are letting them know the window of getting you is closing. If they care, they'll do something about it. Alternatively, accept one of your other offers and move on. Not everybody gets back to you. If you do, though, it's polite to email everyone you interviewed with to tell they you're off the market. That will let them move more quickly to their second choice if you were their first, and it will make them think more highly of you (since someone else wanted you) as well. 

I suspect these phrases are a kind of trick, a bit like "limited time offers" that seem to have been available for years. By suggesting that they are expecting to be flooded with responses from people who aren't prepared to take the process seriously or put in the effort required to land the job, they make the job sound more alluring. Oooh, you are supposed to think, what is this mysterious animal vacancy that is hard to land and that everyone will want to vaguely try for in a non serious timewasting way? Maybe I want it too! There's a good chance that there is in fact no job, just an application process that somehow makes money for the placer of the small ad. You might need to pay some sort of application fee, or get photos taken that the ad-placer can co-ordinate for $100 or so, or work a free day doing deliveries or other odd jobs as a test, and these are the things that the ad is actually trying to solicit. People who balk at them will be called time wasters or reminded that only serious enquiries were requested. Your smart move is to snort with laughter and move on. 

I have fired someone who, if you asked him, would probably tell you that he was fired for no reason. This was a very personable, hard working, smart guy I was hoping would be a developer. He was hired to fill two roles 50-50: one he was objectively bad at and the other he was abysmally awful at. His self assessment on both these roles was that the first was "flawless" and the second "is getting there but I know it needs some work." He told me that he never made the same mistake twice, but he did, all the time - he just didn't realize it was the same mistake. For example, being given some tentative requirements for making an estimate, then hearing in a meeting that the project looked like it was was going to go ahead, and immediately getting started using those requirements, without waiting to hear that the project had been sold or confirming the final requirements. On being told it was sold, not looking in the location we keep requirements to see it had been updated, and not asking the person who said "do it now" whether anything had changed. The second time he did this, he said it wasn't the same mistake because one was a Windows application and one was a web site. I have many more examples which I will spare you. Eventually he was on the tightest leash imaginable: having to send detailed steps of what he planned to do each day, and loop back to tell us how he did against the plan. He never met the plan but he always had a reason and didn't see the pattern. Things would take twice as long as planned, or 4 times, or even ten times! I remember a task my other developer felt would take 2 hours that was taken away from this guy after a week, although as he pointed out, he didn't spend 40 hours on it, probably only 20. The other developer finished it in an hour. There was more than one meeting in my office with the door closed where I said "this can't go on, this cannot keep happening." He was not on any billable projects, only internal-use ones, because it was impossible to keep promises to clients if tasks were given to him. And when he asked me, while I was away visiting a dying relative, if we could meet when I got back to talk about what he needed to do to get the raise he felt he was owed because he had been with us a year and his wife was really pushing him to earn more money, I decided he would never realize how far his performance was from where it needed to be, and I fired him. He was utterly blindsided and furious. But he was not fired "for no reason." Should this happen to you, you can say it must have been personal, somebody must have been jealous, or whatever else you like but the chances are you were so bad at that job you didn't even realize you were bad. It might then be useful to look back over meetings and emails and try to look at them with new eyes: "what if all this is about my not being very good at this work?" Yes, there is praise in this email and this review, but now that I look closely, there is also some criticism. Hmmm..." You may learn something important about yourself. What do you say in the interview? One of my other former staff members suggested this employee apply to a specific job (at that employee's new employer) that needed something he was very good at, and had no need for the skills he was so abysmal at. He applied there and told them (truthfully) that our work mix and business model were not a good fit for him, which is why he was applying to something so different. He got the job and was a bit of a star there, promoted repeatedly to the extent the recommender was thought more highly of for bringing him to them. So a happy ending for everyone because he was doing something he was good at. I don't know if he told them he was fired or he quit, and I don't care. I only kept him around as long as I did because I liked him, and I was genuinely happy that he found something he was good at. But I bet if you asked him he'd say I blindsided him, fired him for no reason, and did it out of personal dislike or some other "politics" reason.
