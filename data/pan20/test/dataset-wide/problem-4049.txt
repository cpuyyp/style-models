There is a unique functor $\mathbf{Kl}(GF) \rightarrow \mathbf{D}$ commuting with the adjunctions from $\mathbf{C}$, since the Kleisli category is initial among adjunctions inducing the given monad; and this functor is always full and faithful, since $\mathbf{Kl}(GF)(A,B) \cong \mathbf{C}(A,GFB) \cong \mathbf{D}(FA,FB)$. So this functor will be an equivalence iff it is essentially surjective, and an isomorphism iff it is bijective on objects. But its object map is just the object map of $F$. So $\mathbf{Kl}(FG)$ is equivalent to $\mathbf{D}$ compatibly with the adjunctions from $\mathbf{C}$ precisely when $F$ is essentially surjective, and isomorphic just when $F$ is bijective on objects. 

At least in most traditional presentations, I think it’s defined as the latter, but some people here also seem to be using the former. The answer to this question depends on which we take. If we take the “a function is just a class” definition, then as suggested in the original question, and as stated in François’ answer, we definitely have some big problems without replacement: Set is no longer complete and co-complete, etc. (nor are the various important categories we construct from it); we can’t easily form categories of presheaves; and so on. Under this approach, we certainly get crippling problems in the absence of replacement. On the other hand, if we take the “a function must be a set” definition, we get some different problems (as pointed out in Carl Mummert’s comments), but it’s not so clear whether they’re big problems or not. We now can form limits of set-indexed families of sets; presheaf categories work how we’d hope; and so on. The problem now is that we can’t form all the set-indexed families we might expect: for instance, we if we’ve got some construction $F$ acting on a class (precisely: if $F$ is a function-class), we can’t generally form the set-indexed family $\langle F^n(X)\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N} \rangle$. This is why we still can’t form something like $\bigcup_n \mathcal{P}^n(X)$, or $\aleph_\omega$. On the other hand, such examples don’t seem to come up (much, or at all?) outside set theory and logics themselves! Most mathematical constructions that do seem to be of this form — e.g. free monoids $F(X) = \sum_n X^n$, and so on — can in fact be done without replacement, one way or another. Now… I seem to remember having been shown an example that was definitely “core maths” where replacement was needed; but I can’t now remember it! So if we take this approach, then we certainly still lose something; but now it’s less clear quite how much we really needed what we lost. (This approach is very close to the question “What maths can be developed over an arbitrary elementary topos?”.) 

Here is $H_\infty\not= E_\infty$, wherein Justin Noel gives an example of an $H_\infty$-structure on a ring spectrum which does not descend from an $E_\infty$-structure. 

$HH_*(CA) = 0$ and $HH_*(SA) \cong HH_{*-1}(A)$. There is a map $A[x^\pm] \to SA$ (selecting an infinite string of just-above-the-diagonal 1's) inducing a surjection $HH_*(A[x^\pm]) \twoheadrightarrow HH_*(SA)$. An external product with an element $\chi = [x] \in HH_1(k[x^\pm])$ induces an inverse $HH_*(SA) \cong HH_{*-1}(A) \xrightarrow{\cdot \chi} HH_*(A[x^\pm])$. 

Do I have the right characterization of localization? Assuming the answer to (a) is yes (or I guess even if it isn't), what is this proposition saying about localization? Replacing $S^0$ with an arbitrary $X$, in Switzer's setup we can hope for the ASS to give us $[X,Y]/\cap_{s\geq 0}F^{s,*+s}$ -- how can we pass between this quotient and $[L_EX,L_EY]$? Is there anything more geometric to say than that the denominator is the subgroup of maps inducing 0 in homology? 

As an exercise, I'm trying to show that for an $(n-1)$-connected space $L$ with $\pi=\pi_n(L)$, the map $\iota_L:L\rightarrow K(\pi,n)$ associated to the fundamental class $\iota_L\in H^n(L;\pi)$ induces an isomorphism $\pi_n(L)\rightarrow \pi_n(K(\pi,n))$. After playing with this for a while, I've found that this feels so tautological that it has to be true, although that doesn't quite constitute a proof. I'm supposed to use only basic definitions / first principles. Presumably, these are: 

Take $X$ to be the “infinite-dimensional dunce’s cap”, with a unique non-degenerate simplex $x_n$ in each dimension, and with every face of $x_n$ equal to $x_{n-1}$. Explicitly, $X_n = \coprod_{m \leq n} \mathrm{Surj}([n],[m])$. So it’s clear that this has finitely many simplices in each dimension, but infinitely many non-degenerate ones in total. 

Yes, it works well to take “functors into C” as the notion of “generalised element of C”. For groupoids, the Hofmann–Streicher model of type theory gives a strong precise statement of this: closed (i.e. non-dependent) types are interpreted exactly as groupoids G; closed elements of such a type are interpreted exactly as functors from 1 to G, i.e. as objects of G; elements in some other context are interpreted as functors from (the interpretation of) that context to G. For general categories, I don’t quite know any comparable precise statement — finding an internal language for Cat that is as expressive as Martin-Löf I.T.T. is for groupoids is an open problem. The best existing work I know is Licata, Harper, 2-dimensional Directed Type Theory, 2011. However, less formally, much work of the Australian school of higher category theory can be seen as taking the view that a “generalised element” of an object C of a bicategory K is a 1-cell into C; or perhaps I should call these “generalised objects” or “generalised 0-elements”, since 2-cells with 0-codomain C can also be seen as “generalised arrows/1-elements” of C. Your example is then the special case where the ambient bicategory is CAT. I can’t recall any specific discussion of the “generalised element” terminology in this context in the literature, but it may well be out there. One classic of this approach is Ross Street, Fibrations in Bicategories, 1980. 

I think my problem is that I don't really understand the defining way Eilenberg-MacLane spaces work. I have an intuitive picture of the Hurewicz homomorphism, and so I guess I have an intuitive picture of its inverse: it takes a homology class in degree $n$ and realizes it as the image of a bunch of based $n$-spheres (which is made possible by the Hurewicz theorem). We can look at this more or less as a cochain in $C^n_{cell}(L;\pi)$, and this is the element $\iota_L\in H^n(L;\pi)$. But then I have no idea how to actually turn this into a map $\iota_L : L\rightarrow K(\pi,n)$, or whether I'm even supposed to. Because I'd still like to work this out myself to whatever extent I can, a good hint (if one exists) is worth more to me than a straight-up answer. Of course, I'm happy with either. Thanks! 

First of all, I'm confused by the first sentence. Shouldn't it just say $u$ is a cochain, not a cocycle? Probably more importantly, I don't really see what's supposed to be going on in part (i), since those two addends aren't in the same cohomological dimensions. I'm getting that $\delta (u\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 u) = 4(a\cup u)+2(a\cup_1 u+u\cup_1 a)$, and I'm not sure how to cancel the last terms. The addends in the RHS came straight from the addends on the LHS, i.e. there's no interaction between the two terms as far as I can tell, which makes me doubt myself. This could be just a lot of silliness on my part, but I'd appreciate it if someone could clear this up for me. And of course I'd love to hear about fun or unexpected applications of this particular operation... EDIT Following Tyler's suggestion, I've found that changing the formula to $u\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 \delta u$ does wonders. Now that I've reached it, I'm having difficulty with part (iv). I have that $P_2(u+v)=P_2(u)+P_2(v)+u\cup_0 v+v\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 \delta v+v\cup_1 \delta u$. So somehow those last four terms are supposed to collapse into $u\cup v$ as computed using the non-trivial pairing. How exactly should this work? I have a vague sense that a representing cochain should only be spitting out the values 0(mod 4) and 2(mod 4), the latter only when the cup guys both spat out 1(mod 2)'s. So I'm slightly inclined to believe that the first two loose terms, which are equal since $\deg(u)=\deg(v)=2p$ and $\cup_0=\cup$ (the usual cup product), might sum to the desired "$u\cup v$" thing. Assuming we represent $u$ and $v$ by the same cochains throughout the equation, which I'm pretty sure is a valid thing to do(???), then if they evaluate to an even number then that sum will be 0(mod 4) while if they evaluate to an odd number then that sum will be 2(mod 4). So I'm thinking that somehow those last two terms should vanish. But why? And is there a concise way of writing everything I've just said, e.g. using notation $\rho:Z_2\otimes Z_2\rightarrow Z_4$ for the pairing, etc.? And probably more importantly, is there any significance to the fact that the cup product measures the failure of the Pontrjagin square to be a group homomorphism? 

(Note: this started as a different question that soon changed form, thanks to the answers.) Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \ltimes H_4$, where $H_4$ is the Higman group and $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $H_4$ in the obvious way (permuting the four standard generators cyclicly). The group $G$ is generated by two elements, $a$ and $t$: here $t$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, and $a$ is such that $t a t^{-1} \cdot a \cdot t a^{-1} t^{-1} = a^2$. As is well-known, $H_4$ has plenty of normal subgroups (though none of finite index). My question is about normal subgroups of $G$ other than $\{e\}$, $H_4$, $G$ and (thanks to a commenter for reminding me of this last one) $2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \ltimes H_4$. (a) Can you prove that the normal closure in $G$ of any word of the form $a^{k_1} t a^{k_2} t a^{k_3} t a^{k_4} t$ ($k_1,\dotsc,k_4$ integers, not all $0$) necessarily contains $H_4$? (b) Can you prove that the normal closure in $G$ of any set consisting of two distinct words of the form $a^{k_1} t a^{k_2} t a^{k_3} t a^{k_4} t a^{k_5} t$ must contain $H_4$? Note: I am saying "can you prove this" on purpose; a few lines of GAP code (sent to me by Kate Juschenko) suggest that what I am asking you to prove is in fact true. Note 2: Playing around with the code a bit more suggests that, in fact, the normal closure of $(a^3 t)^4$ does not contain $H_4$. Anti-note 2: the normal closure of $(a^3 t)^4$ does contain $H_4$ (unless I've bungled). The proof I can give for this involves words with powers about 2^256 - no wonder GAP couldn't find the proof. The same argument should work for $(a^k t)^4$. (c) Can you prove that the normal closure in $G$ of $(a t)^5$ does not contain $H_4$? (GAP fails to prove that this is false, on KJ's computer and mine, at least. Any further information on the normal closure is welcome.) 

(hence also, how we define subsequent things like “a small-category-indexed diagram of sets”) There are at least two main options here: 

Any non-discrete totally disconnected space gives a counterexample, e.g. the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. If a space $X$ is totally disconnected, then every simplex in it is constant (since the simplices are connected). So the singular set of $X$ is the discrete simplicial set on its points $|X|$; hence its geometric realisation is the discrete space on its points. Converting this explicitly to a counterexample to fullness: consider the identity map $|X| \to X$, where $X$ is totally disconnected and non-discrete. Then the induced map of singular sets is an isomorphism; but its inverse doesn’t come from any continuous map $X \to |X|$. 

The definitions are equivalent as stands; no extra conditions (eg majorants for infinite sets of factorisations) are needed. This is essentially because colimits in $\mathbf{Sets}$ are computed finitarily. One way to present the colimit $\underset{i}{\varinjlim} Hom(X,F(i))$ (see eg Mac Lane CWM) is as 

The common thread in each of these examples seems to be something like: The “skinniest widget” that you're looking for is the initial widget, if one exists. (Edit: actually, as Tom Goodwillie points out in comments on the OP, it's subtler than this; in some cases you're interested in widgets that aren't quite initial, but are nicer than just a random weakly initial one.) By the adjoint functor theorem, as you say, the construction can be done in two stages, given the solution-set condition and enough limits. First, take a product of the solution set to get a weakly inital widget $W$. Then take the intersection of all the sub-widgets of $W$; and this gives the initial widget you want. In the widest generality, this is the “intersection” in the categorical sense of being a limit of various subobjects of a fixed object, i.e. a limit in $\mathrm{Sub}(W)$. But in most common examples, e.g. in any algebraic category over $\mathbf{Sets}$, this'll be intersection in the normal set-theoretic sense (since the forgetful functor down to $\mathbf{Sets}$ preserves/reflects limits). [I'm not sure whether this is quite what you want! It seems to answer the question you asked… but pretty much everything I say is already implicit in what you've written in the question, so maybe you were after something more?] 

Let $A$ be a finite set of real numbers or integers. We know how to characterize, broadly speaking, sets $A$ such that $A+A$ is not much larger than $A$ (Freiman's theorem). I have a question that feels somewhat related but may or may not be. What are the sets $A$ such that there is a bijection $f:A\mapsto A$ for which $$\left|\{x+f(x): x\in A\}\cap A\right|\geq (1-\epsilon) |A|,$$ where $\epsilon$ is small? In particular, if $A$ is an interval in the integers (say, $A =\{1,\dotsc,n\}$, or $A=\{-n,-n+1,\dotsc,n\}$), is there such a bijection $f$? The related question of whether there are such $f$ altogether (with $A$ being initially unspecified) is easily settled. See below. The answer does imply that there are very many sets $A$ for which there are such $f$, but it is unclear to me whether there is a good characterization of such sets $A$ (and whether, say, $A$ can be an interval in the integers). 

(The question I asked at first.) In case (b), can one give a better bound on $\ell'$ than $O((\log n)^2)$? (Answer: no; see below.) (The question I meant to ask.) In case (b), can one give a better on bound on $\ell$ than $O((\log n)^2)$? Perhaps $O(\log n)$? (Answer: yes; see below.) 

In fact, it can be shown by (a whole lot of) brute force that the morphism of cospans towards the bottom of the question is actually a Reedy acyclic fibration -- at least with respect to the Reedy structure on $\Lambda^2_2$ described by $$ (\deg = 2) \rightarrow (\deg = 1) \leftarrow (\deg = 0) . $$ Since this induces a Reedy model structure on $\mathrm{Fun}(\Lambda^2_2,\mathrm{sSet})$ for which the pullback functor $$ \lim : \mathrm{Fun}(\Lambda^2_2,\mathrm{sSet}) \rightarrow \mathrm{sSet} $$ is a right Quillen functor, this proves the necessary claim. The full details will eventually appear in a forthcoming paper. In the meantime, I still would very much welcome an "invariant" proof of this seemingly simple fact! 

I'm trying to understand the following theorem, but I don't think I'm reading it correctly. Let $(\mathcal{C},J)$ be a site (with a subcanonical topology). Write $\mathcal{C}/X$ for the groupoid of objects over $X\in \mathcal{C}$. Let $\mbox{Sh}:\mathcal{C}^{op} \rightarrow \mbox{Gpds}$ be the functor taking $X$ to the category of sheaves on $\mathcal{C}/X$ and isomorphisms of sheaves, and let $\mbox{Sh-map}:\mathcal{C}^{op} \rightarrow \mbox{Gpds}$ be the functor taking $X$ to the category whose objects are sheaf morphisms $\mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}$ and whose morphisms are commuting squares of sheaves determined by isomorphisms $\mathscr{F}_1 \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathscr{F}_2$ and $\mathscr{G}_1 \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathscr{G}_2$. These are in fact both stacks on $\mathcal{C}$, and moreover they determine a category-object $(\mbox{Sh},\mbox{Sh-map})$ in the category of stacks. 

It is not possible in the case $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{sSets}$, $\mathcal{I} = (\cdot \to \cdot)$. To see this, note that since $\mathcal{I}$ is both an inverse and a direct category, the projective cofibrations (resp. injective fibrations) are exactly the Reedy cofibrations (resp. fibrations). So your condition would imply that any commutative square $\newcommand{\ra}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ #1\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\ras}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ \smash{#1}\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\bigg\downarrow\raise.5ex\rlap{\scriptstyle#1}}$ $$ \begin{array}{c} A & \ra{h} & C \\ \da{f} & & \da{g} \\ B & \ra{k} & D \end{array} $$ factors as $$ \begin{array}{c} A & \ra{h_1} & A' & \ra{h_2} & C \\ \da{f} & & \da{f'} & & \da{g} \\ B & \ra{k_1} & B' & \ra{k_2} & D \end{array} $$ with the left square a trivial Reedy cofibration, and the right square a Reedy fibration. In particular, if $f$ is a cofibration and $g$ a fibration, then $f'$ must be both a cofibration and a fibration; so (in $\mathbf{sSets}$) it must just be an inclusion of connected components, and in particular must induce isomorphisms on $\pi_k$ for $k > 0$. But $f'$ is weakly equivalent to $f$, so if $f$ acts non-trivially on some $\pi_k$, $k > 0$, this is impossible. For instance, take $A = C = D = 1$, and $B = S^1$; then such a factorisation is impossible. 

A $t$-design on $v$ points with block size and index $\lambda$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of a set $V$ with $v$ elements satisfying the following properties: (a) every $B\in\mathcal{B}$ has $k$ elements, (b) for every subset $T$ of $V$ with $t$ elements, there are exactly $\lambda$ sets $B\in \mathcal{B}$ such that $T\subset B$. The Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson inequality states that, for any $s\leq \min(t/2,v-k)$, $$b\geq \binom{v}{s},$$ where $b=|\mathcal{B}|$, the number of elements of $\mathcal{B}$. Question: what happens if you drop the assumption that all sets in $\mathcal{B}$ have the same number of elements? Can you still give a lower bound on $b$ similar to the above? Feel free to assume that every $B\in\mathcal{B}$ satisfies $|B|\leq 2 |V|/3$, say. (Notes: 1) the case $t=2$ is known ("nonuniform Fisher's inequality"); 2) there are papers by Frankl-Wilson and Babai on "the nonuniform Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson inequality", but they generalize something else from the same paper.) 

As far as I know, there is one way currently known to -- in principle -- compute the Mertens function $M(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} \mu(n)$ in time essentially $O\left(x^{1/2}\right)$, namely, a modification of the Lagarias-Odlyzko method. Mertens' function in time $O(\sqrt x)$ Computing the Mertens function The Lagarias-Odlyzko method's main variant is designed to compute $\pi(x)$ in time essentially $O(x^{1/2})$. In the last few years, it has been implemented and optimized: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Has the analogue for computing $M(x)$ ever been implemented? If not, why not? Are there significant ways in which this variant of Lagarias-Odlyzko would be much slower or harder to implement than the version for $\pi(x)$? (One guess is that evaluating residues of $1/\zeta(s)$ may be hard. I know that this is a difficulty when one tries to obtain explicit forms of analytic results on $M(x)$, but I do not know whether the issue is at all relevant to Lagarias-Odlyzko and similar computational methods.)
