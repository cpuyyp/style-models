There are plenty Potassium overdose can appear like a heart attack and is essential in the body. I believe it's odorless and tasteless. It can be extracted from bananas and or easily bought from a pharmacy. Because its critical throughout the body it wouldn't be easily detected in an autopsy though blood work would eventually reveal elevated levels of it. 

Here's the root problem with this scenario as well as all the answers here: Contradiction: These beings do not follow "logic or reason", all life as we know it follows some degree of logic, even animals. The closest relation one could draw to these beings are demons. So this post is more akin to how to justify demonic intentions as good from their point of view. Based on the information provided you could say that demon being X realizes that his technology is powered by "the screams of unborn children" (brilliant lol), so to help power humanity they trigger events that result in the slaughter of pregnant women. (would be some fun political parallels that could be drawn with that) The problem with that is, that follows a logical realization that because you can get power from that source so too can the humans. Contradiction: Even the beings desire to "help" the humans is a logical process. To help requires you to see a problem and use your knowledge to resolve it. The only way to fix this scenario is to change the notion of "help" to interact with, having the beings perceive humans as just different beings. Based on that analysis: The only thing that these beings can be able to comprehend is perhaps illogical things like raw emotion without the logical understanding of the cause and effect that led to that emotion. The hard part here becomes: how do you influence human emotion without relying on logical cause and effect. So you cant say money makes human A happy so we make money rain from the skies. It could be that these beings can read emotion telepathically and could communicate emotion back. So the beings language is emotion. Plausible Scenario A: Human A feels lusty and services himself then feels relief. (minor logic) Being A associates feeling 'lusty' with relief and then broadcasts intense 'lusty' feelings in Human B causing him to relieve himself publically or go on a forced loving spree. (can replicate this with other behaviors like eating, masochism, sadism, etc. to terrible effect) Plausible Scenario B: Being B perceives the emotions of 'happy','proactiveness', 'depression', and 'lazyness' something like 'hi','how','are','you' and upon greeting each human sends them into a bipolar spiral. 

Habitability is a very variable equation so first to answer your question, probably a volcanically active planet like IO whose core is constantly squashed by the other moons and Jupiter. That would keep the crust from solidifying too much. After that we need to create conditions where water is liquid and the atmosphere is breathable (for human habitability). Then the question becomes what to do with that heat and volcanic atmosphere. Like IO, put it far out in the solar system so the surface can cool faster. So the equation becomes a balance of supplementing solar heat for volcanic such that the average temperature supports liquid water. And the atmosphere Being a volcanic world the atmosphere wouldn't be good for photosynthetic organisms. However, plenty of terrestrial organisms are capable of making energy from volcanic environments. All humans need to survive is Air, food, and water. This is the crazy part. What if we would genetically engineer an algae capable of producing oxygen from volcanic energy. What if we could then reengineer our crops to produce edible foods from volcanic energy. The final variable for human habitability is having a crust stable enough to produce long-term structures. This is largely an engineering problem however they would have to identify plates and build settlements towards the center as the edges would be too chaotic. These edge areas would probably be ideal for agricultural areas though as they would have more farmable energy. This wouldn't be a lovely place for humans(as we know them) with the ash requiring masks but we could irk out an existence. With some self genetic engineering we could be adapted to thrive though. This answer does rely a bit on the magic of genetic engineering but realistically, that's the answer to any real terraforming attempt. Note: the engineered algae isn't too farfetched, algae was among the first organisms to survive the harsh early volcanic Earth so much so that it eventually changed the atmosphere. The only challenge here is making an algae capable of making oxygen from volcanic energy instead of sunlight. This would also be a great way to extract the harmful gases from the atmosphere as food sources for your air makers. Like our own ecosystem its likely you would need a spectrum of organisms to cleanse different toxins. 

Yes and No, Nano-materials could resist nano and larger materials from being caught in it. But might not be able to resist smaller than nano materials from being caught like reactive compounds. Take for instance that spray you put on objects so water based substances slide right off. How that works is by spraying on silica particles onto the surface of an object. Those particles work on a molecular level (smaller than nano) to repel water based substances. And even then it can be damaged by a scratch or bond with some other compound. Alot of this depends on the structure, chemistry, and end composition of the nano-fiber. For instance spider silk is a nano-fiber based substance formed from woven protein chains. Stuff gets caught in that all the time. What really matters here is what is your definition of clean? 

Is essentially impossible to determine as it is dependent on the source, energy of the neutrino, and scale and sophistication of the detector. As for the root objective of this being about energy production that is even more absurd as the electric output from these interactions is so rare and miniscule that often the hardest part in building these arrays is finding big enough and isolated locations that the external environment isn't releasing electrons that would contaminate the data. This is why they cant be built in the ocean with moving sea water against metal sources or lightning strikes. 

The force of impact alone from the slice would kill all life on its surface. As would pushing it back together as would exposing the core so basically all life on earth would be killed 3 times over 

In these situations the common conditional occurrence is called "Cabin Fever". Essentially when a human trapped in a confined space with limited social exposure for long periods, certain predisposed minds can snap in violent and/or psychotic ways. This rarely happens in deep sea or space missions anymore as candidates usually undergo psych evaluations to prevent exactly this scenario. So you would have to go with the cop out solution which is Person A suddenly decides he hates everyone because they small funny (or whatever) and does something about it. 

Not really As you said this doesn't prevent us from getting anything we wouldn't normally get. What this would change is it would make us more productive as a race. If we healed faster we would spend less time being sick or injured and more time doing things. But this doesn't really change our society. Perhaps employers would be more demanding and offer less sick leave but again that's a questionable impact on overall society. 

Society would Collapse permanently hard and fast Writing is the foundational technology that has made civilization possible. Without writing you don't have laws or accounting. Basically we would devolve to mere tribalism. In a tribe a chief can tell someone verbally what to do. In a government a leader cant verbally communicate with separate localities simultaneously. Its not possible. Even the ancient Sumerians wrote trade information on clay tablets. with all the warnings on everything now days it would be akin to releasing a caveman into a modern setting minus the small amount of buffer knowledge the initial generation of people had going into this. 

What is a currency? -All a currency is, is an item that society says has universal value such that it can be exchanged for goods and services. The problem with currency in general is what is that value and what happens when that value changes. Historically, currencies that are made with rare widely desirable goods (like gold) tend to be more stable, because everyone wants gold. The problem with those currency system is that you then have a finite resource that represents the entire economy so the value of the currency becomes prohibitive in small denominations. You also have the problem when someone floods the market with that good so its value decreases. Paper currencies have similar problems, so bottom line no currency is perfect especially across isolated economies. Your best bet is to have a currency that's difficult to produce yet universally needed. Perhaps: Units of Energy Perhaps: In the form of anti-matter as a storage option, or some other sci-fi energy storage concept Everyone needs electricity so it can easily be used as a universal futuristic trade currency. The trick is coming up with a reasonable storage method that is carry able, safe, and easy to use. 

Nothing inherently fears Fire Only when you are burned (or feel the excessive heat) do you become conditioned to avoid it. Because we humans (tool makers) have figured that we can use fire to achieve a goal, we embrace it. Another psychological aspect most fauna employ, is not a fear but an aversion to an unknown element. Treating the unknown with caution is a natural survival mechanic. So in the movies when you see arctic wolves attacking survivors. They are hesitating because they've never seen fire before and don't know what it can do. And/Or, they got whacked in the face with a torch or hot branch and already learned that that sucks. 

How this completely solves the question: The OP provided no limitations what so ever that would prevent him from employing this method. This is the method that we use today and its brutally simple. Fun fact Coincidentally this is also how 3D graphics work to an extent, lots of triangles forming a mesh that outlines an object. I also want to point out all the software links that people posted( this is basically how they work). 

Not much change really, The medieval period wasn't known for its adaptability. As long as these shields could be beaten with brute force, methods would largely remain the same. The tactical usage of the shields, on the other hand, would experience the most variability but that is a different question that impacts this one. One aspect to explore though. Cavalry would potentially be impacted by this. Cavalry was a huge component of this periods warfare. Cavalry works by quickly charging enemy lines in rapid singular assaults and then fleeing before they can counter attack. Being that these shields require successive damage cavalry can effectively be halted. However you said they could be pierced like steel and in this period the lance was designed specifically for piercing mounted knights. So potentially and potentially not would this affect the usage of cavalry.
