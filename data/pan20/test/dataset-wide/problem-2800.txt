I don't really get the argument here - it simply seems to say God is not necessary to create the universe if there are laws in place that can create it by itself. However, even if this is true, it could still be possible that God exists - God could have created these laws - even if they have always been true - by an eternal expression of his will, given God is timeless. The last argument says that the idea that God created the universe out of nothing is false because if it was truly out of nothing, God would be included in that nothingness, and therefore cannot create the universe. But I think this rests on a misunderstanding of creation out of nothing. Creation out of nothing I think states God created the universe out of nothing, but that does not mean created the universe with nothing else in existence. So are my criticisms on these arguments valid? Since Scientific American is a trustworthy source, I doubt these arguments would have such obvious pitfalls. Thoughts? Edit: They posted the article online. It can be found here. 

Therefore there must exist some intelligent entity which directs the universe (or everything in it) towards goals, and that entity is God. 

In mathematics there's a type of book, bordering on the textbook but slightly different, that compiles examples to demonstrate the necessity of various conditions on theorems and the correct directions of implication. For example, to show that a connected space need not be path-connected one can construct the topologist's sine curve. My question: are there any similar compilations in the philosophical literature? For instance, in epistemology the obvious set would be the Gettier cases (to show that JTB is an insufficient analysis), along with Armstrong's (?) barn facades and fake towns (to show that context seems to be important) and so on. In ethics we have Nozick's experience machine (the limits of hedonism). Further, potentially-not-site-appropriate question: do people think such a compilation would be in any way valuble in philosophy? 

To generalise a little, in case the moral of the above isn't clear, we 'prove' that two objects are distinct by providing some property that holds of one but not the other. It's an open question in metaphysics whether distinct objects can share every property (contenders might be the object of 52 cards and the object of the deck, I guess). Within logic, though, if two elements of your domain are distinct but the same predicates hold of them there isn't a way to prove that they are distinct - you could show that rigorously in a quite straightforward way; proof systems for first-order logic use (roughly) the above method for proving inequality. 

Buridan's ass states a problem where a hypothetical donkey has to decide between two equal choices (food and water, an equal distance apart from the donkey). Since they are completely equal, neither is chosen and the donkey dies. This may be solved by randomness, but God is not random. Would this create a problem for God (God cannot choose either one), given that such situations where two equal choices can exist for him? 

The SEP entry on perfect moral goodness states this argument against the possibility of a perfect moral goodness. Necessarily, God actualizes some world Necessarily, for each actualizable world w1, there is an actualizable world w2 such that from the moral point of view one would prefer w2 to w1 Necessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, there is a morally better world that God does not actualize yet could have (from (2)) Necessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, God's act of actualizing that world is not as morally good as some other act that God does not perform but could have (from (3)) Necessarily, for whatever world that God actualizes, God's agency is not as morally good as it could have been (from (4)) Necessarily, God's agency is not perfectly good (from (1), (5)) They seem to state the main discussion point is between (3) and (4), but I don't see why one must accept (2). What makes them think a best world isn't possible? 

Q1: From your experience how can mathematicians deal (or how they usually chose to behave) with this huge mathematical universe and be satisfied from a philosophical point of view? Generally, the same way most people deal with a huge universe; they don't think about the philosophical underpinnings. Almost everyone handles reality perfectly comfortably without confronting questions of whether possible worlds, universals, temporal parts and so on exist, or whether their conception of the world corresponds in a meaningful way with reality. Mathematicians have the structures they work with, and on the whole don't necessarily interrogate their assumptions about in what sense those structures exist and so on. Q2: How can a mathematician interested in the foundation of mathematics be satisfied by an always partial knowledge of the mathematic? I think someone interested in the foundation of mathematics actually has a good reason not to be troubled by their incomplete knowledge of mathematics: they are working towards a theory of the foundations, not what is built above them. Just in the same way a particle physicist concerns themselves with the fundamental constituents of matter and doesn't worry about their inability to predict the flow of chaotic systems, a foundational mathematician has no reason specifically to worry about their inability to solve some complex problem elsewhere in mathematics. 

I don't get the part where he says talking about nothing makes it something. Sure, nothing exists as a word, but a word that means the non-existence of something. So, we are talking about the non-existence of something - here, the non-existence of everything. 

The problem of animal suffering states that God wouldn't allow animal suffering because animal suffering is evil. Skeptical theism is the idea that God knows infinitely more than humans, and hence we cannot say what is good or bad for God because we do not know all that He knows. A skeptical theist typically responds to the human problem of evil by saying evil is for the greater happiness or overall betterment of that person either here or in heaven. These responses seem to not apply to animals. Since it is generally accepted God does not give animals heaven, the only argument left is for the greater happiness of the animals. This seems questionable, but I guess can be argued. So what is the skeptical theist's respond to this? Note: I'm mostly talking about natural evil for animals (i.e. forest fires), but human evil toward animals are also in the picture. 

As has been said, this is not a philosophical question. However, a few issues off the top of my head: 

If an almighty god is some entity which can cause any proposition to be the case, then if such a god existed it would be possible for it to express pi as the ratio of two integers. I would take that to be a pretty strong argument against such an entity existing, but I imagine there have been views to the contrary historically. If an almighty god is some entity which can cause any possible proposition to be the case, then since it is not possible to express pi as the ratio of two integers such an entity would not be able to do so. So yes, the answer relies on what you think an almighty god is. But not in an especially novel or interesting way, in my opinion. 

Limited as Google is as a tool for lexical research, the fact that Googling the phrase fails to turn up anything beyond this question suggests it's unique to the author. I don't think they've used it as though it's common, though; it's simply a reference to a relatively well-known visual paradigm shift. 

I suppose it is difficult to try to picture nothingness, but I think it is meaningful to discuss. It is simply the non-existence of everything, which seems perfectly coherent and meaningful to me. 

A Scientific American article I was reading (I couldn't find it online) has a one-page discussion about nothingness. Some of the discussion points seem a little questionable to me, and I'd like to ask people more knowledgeable about some of these. The first point I'd like to know about is his argument that nothing is actually something. He says, 

If time doesn't exist (this Wikipedia page and this SEP article provide some arguments for the non-existence of time), does that mean God doesn't? Given that it is impossible for God to exist completely outside any sort of time (how would he create anything if he can't change?), how could he exist if time can't? 

What to the Gettier Problems mean for God? Given my (limited) research, the Gettier Problems say if something is true (the T in JTB), one cannot always have knowledge that it is true. If God knows everything that is true, it seems that is impossible. Is this a sound argument? 

Clarification: I used the term 'counterexamples' since that's the popular term in maths; I mean what I've hinted at in the examples above: a case which establishes a conditions or bounds for a theory. 

A good starting point is to figure out the possible arrangements of people and properties, and then draw a table of what they would answer to various questions in each arrangement.after some trial and error you'll develop an intuition for the kind of questions that give you useful results. Note that as posed there are some questions some men can't answer (specifically, neither the truth-teller nor the liar knows what the random-answerer will say in response to any question). I think Boolos describes this as a head-exploding outcome. 

As has been pointed out already, if you are using logic to talk about apples and oranges you have already provided some model (say, a is an apple and o is an orange - formally speaking you've set up a function from constants in your logical language to objects or types or fruit or whatever). So I'm reasonably comfortable that the following proof is no less rigorous than what you've got already: let P (a one-place predicate) be assigned the meaning 'needs to be peeled to be eaten'*. Then Po is true and Pa is false, so then clearly ¬(x = y) holds. *obviously if you don't peel your oranges feel free to substitute some other predicate that fits 

Given a materialist view on things (the mind cannot exist separate from the body), it seems on the surface that an afterlife is possible. However, the SEP entry on afterlife seems to provide some pretty good objections to this idea. How can any of these problems be surmounted for a theist? One of the objections is this: if God created multiple beings the same as the one on Earth, how would our consciousness be preserved? This question is not asking if mind-body dualism is right or wrong, rather I'm asking whether afterlife is possible given materialism. Edit: When I say "materialist", I mean the idea that our bodies go to heaven with our minds, not just our minds "by themselves". And this question is mostly aimed from a Christian perspective. 

The multiverse seems to be gaining traction of the scientific community, even becoming the prevalent worldview. It seems some types of the multiverse theory, such as the many-worlds interpretation, seem to go against basic theological principles. But are these really a problem? For example, if every possible universe existed, God would have no control, and presumably universes with infinite evil and suffering would exist, and everything in between. I guess one could argue that the many-world interpretation requires the universe to be logically valid, but going against God would not logically be possible (?). Some other quick arguments such as this universe is not truly God's only plan, we are not unique, we have no moral choices because everything happens, other God-like (who could contest God on his decisions) entities existing in some parallel universes, etc. could be made. Is this, and presumably many others, argument valid?
