RAM, RAM and more RAM! Those are all RAM-hungry monster apps (I include WinXP in that), so before spending thousands on a new machine or hundreds on a new graphics card, I recommend trying a few tens on some more good quality main memory (which you can always re-use in a new machine later). 

I was about to say that I thought it would be easiest to bind the machines to the Directory domain using the Mac Directory Utility in Applications>Utilities, but I'll defer to duffbeer703 (cos my practical AD experience ended with 2000 Server). If you get stuck, there's some good info at MacWindows.com and there's a specific forum at afp548.com. As for your plan about using limited rights accounts for a temporary period, that sounds very sensible to me. 

I used to run a video company back in the 90's when everyone had 56k modems and ISDN was, like, really cool!! Sneakernet (or Taxinet we used to call it) was the only way to get many things done... 

If you have any control over the running applications, why not have them log to syslog and have syslog output to the serial terminal? Having said that, asking screen to start all the applications in separate sessions using e.g. the at or exec commands is an interesting idea. However, there are two concerns: 

low upstream latency and high link uptime Asterisk server uptime; use separate UPS. People tend to get cranky if they can't call the janitor and tell that there is a power failure in the house. decent end-user equipment 

Which means, that you can mail to e.g. www.mydomain.com and mail servers will try to deliver to that web server. EDIT: To clarify: the MX record can live in any DNS server whatever. Or, put differently, it must live in exactly the DNS server that is master for the domain the MX record wants to be in. 

You can't have a DNS record for some other zone (mydns.com) in your mydomain.com zones. That record belongs in the zone for mydns.com. This won't cause some kind of critical failure or explosion, BIND's just saying that it's going to ignore this line. ====== Checking your listed DNS servers for the A record of mapvivo.info seems to indicate that they don't have any data at all for your zone (both return results like this): 

invokes a login shell, which among other things, ensures that root's and other shell startup scripts are run, just like as if you'd logged in directly as root via console or SSH. root's profile usually sets your path to include which is where generally lives. 

Try running before starting tomcat. If this works, you can probably add this to one or both of the startup scripts, or in , or some other shell profile script. 

However, this time it failed to do the trick. I rebooted the box in the hope that the BIOS interface would have something, but nothing obvious. The current state of the RAID1 set is as follows: 

Your immediate problem is that you declare a default gateway on both entries. I suppose that this will result in whichever comes up last to "win" and be default gateway. However, if you remove the one on eth1, you will have the problem that the box will reply on eth0, even if the packet arrived on eth1. In order to tell the box to reply on a particular interface, you need to do what is commonly referred to as source routing. I have the following set of commands on a box: 

I assume that you are referring to $URL$ . For what it is worth, I use it to warn for numerical intervals to good effect. Don't know about graphing. 

Obviously, the advantage of DiskUtil is that it's free and currently does everything you need it to. The disdavantage is that the users don't like it (fair enough, it's not very friendly). The advantages of Toast are that the users will be happy and if their requirements change in the future, Toast is good for just about any burning task a Mac User can throw at it. The disadvantage is that it costs money. My advice is to compare the cost of the licenses for Toast with the cost of the time you will spend doing DiskUtil support for grumpy users, and pick the cheaper! 

You can use Cat5 for really short runs in a Gigabit environment, but it isn't recommended. Cat5e is fine in almost all scenarios, but if you're wiring from scratch, use Cat6, it's only fractionally more expensive. Good Wikipedia info here - particularly the link about "far-end crosstalk". 

I thought 0.0.0.2 is a valid IP? UPDATE The issue is indeed periodic and has been going on for several days (since 2015-12-20 according to my nagios): 

I think you should be able to solve that by using svn switch to tell Subversion that you are talking to "another" repo. --relocate may be needed in this scenario, I think. 

Solution WARNING: Below solution to issue 1 is DANGEROUS. If RPM upgrade breaks you are likely to end up with a broken system. Solution to issue 2 may result in installation of broken packages! Issue 1 can be circumvented by backporting RPM 4.6 from source RPM. See $URL$ Build dependencies for soure RPM: 

Quality In my experience, your company suffers in reputation from bad phone lines, so make sure you get get decent quality from your installation. Quality is among other things: 

It looks like you got it right the first time with The problem seems to lie in ; you may try using instead, or otherwise fix 's permissions or ownership. Out of curiosity, can you do: * for us? Is the partition or drive where you are trying to build this mounted noexec, like /tmp or similar? The output of should show us whether that's the case :) *edited 

I just had to test this out in VirtualBox. It turns out you're limited by the size of the smallest disk in the pool. Thus 2x500GB and 1x250GB in raidz1 will yield only 250GB of usable space. Once you upgrade the last disk (and ensure ) then you gain access to the extra space. Regular zpools stripe the data across as many disks/vdevs you have in your pool and if one is larger than the other, it just stops striping when the smaller disk is full.
