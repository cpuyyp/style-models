When I was in my twenties I experimented for several weeks by surviving only on milk mixed with a well-known British energy drink (Lucozade) supplemented with vitamin pills. At the time I used to cycle to work ending with a hill. At the end of the trial I felt fitter and was slimmer than when I started. I had no adverse symptoms at all. (see disclaimer) The biggest effect of all came from joining colleagues at mealtimes. After only four days I lost any cravings for what they were eating but it was just so boring. The whole business of eating is important socially or alone and was the reason I stopped. I had a huge desire to chew and swallow and even to use eating utensils. 

We have to consider the history of this world. Let us suppose there was a time when the primitive inhabitants weren't aware of there being a god and simply didn't pray. Maybe they didn't even have language at that point. As soon as they discovered how to speak and how to pray they would start to ask for things. At first these would be simple things because they are a primitive people. They might ask to have a successful hunt for example. Any member of this race who didn't get the hang of the system would simply be eliminated by natural selection. As time went on, the survivors would learn how to handle things. They would keep their children under careful protection until they were able to pray properly. Maybe they would have to be gagged so as not to speak childish prayers. As the society became more sophisticated, people would start to realise there are rules to these prayers. Scientist-priests would experiment by trying out different forms of prayer to see what effect they had. They would become experts in manipulating the system. My answer Get the best education you can. This world would definitely have the equivalent of a University of Prayer. One of the most important classes would be Formal Logic and its relationship to Prayer Logic. Answer edited in accordance with justified criticism. 

Bajau sea nomads For generations they have lived on the ocean, diving and fishing, and rarely setting foot on land. But now these marine nomads risk destroying the reefs that sustain them Diana Botutihe was born at sea. Now in her 50s, she has spent her entire life on boats that are typically just 5m long and 1.5m wide. She visits land only to trade fish for staples such as rice and water, and her boat is filled with the accoutrements of everyday living – jerry cans, blackened stockpots, plastic utensils, a kerosene lamp and a pair of pot plants. 

The only way to get infinite money is for there to be infinite money for you to get. Exploit the multiverse theory. Move sideways between universes and con your alternate selves into lending/giving you money. Get each of them to visit two other parallel universes and do the same and pass half their gain on to you. This is pretty much a standard pyramid scheme. There are infinite universes in the multiverse so there is no limit to the amount you (and in fact your alternate selves) can make. 

History and mythology are full of characters who were credited with having superpowers. It is quite likely that the acclaim he gets will go to his head and he will encourage people to worship him as a god. In any case they would see him as a hero. Women would flock to him. People who were seen as superheroes in their day or even today. Alexander the Great’s army was well, great. It consisted of more than 48,000 soldiers and at times grew to over 90,000 soldiers. Buddha There are 376 million followers worldwide. Buddhists seek to reach a state of nirvana, following the path of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, who went on a quest for Enlightenment around the sixth century BC. There are of course many more. 

All combatants should wear a number of these on their wrists. As soon as there is even a hint of trouble they deploy them. I have noticed that women can do this remarkably quickly and change styles in a matter of seconds. All serious fighters would practise the art of instant hair-management as part of their training. It would be as important as a quick draw with a gun or a blade. 

If you simply want to preserve numbers regardless of politics, ethical considerations or anything else, you could kill Einstein. Then the atomic bomb wouldn't be made. It wouldn't be dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and many Japanese people would have survived. 

Question What method could our commander use to control the zombies enough to send them against the foes rather than attacking his own soldiers? The Clegg have no knowledge of zombies. How can our commander ensure that the Clegg don't learn how to create and control their own zombies and mount a counter-attack? Is there any point in our commander even trying? Should he just give up, destroy the zombies and carry on with conventional fighting? Note Zombies will not attempt to bite or attack other zombies. They are only attracted towards live humans who they detect by sound and movement. They can walk or break into a shambling run. 

That isn't going to work for my aliens when grabbing onto other spacecraft. There are no sound waves in space. How can they use electromagnetic or other physics to create their tractor beam? 

The bartender picks up the phone and calls the local mental institution to see if an inmate has escaped. 

You haven't described the level of technology. I'll assume (for no particular reason) that 'tribespeople' indicates the technology is not advanced. If the person returns from a mountain with tablets of stone that God gave to them, it presumably couldn't have come from a hallucination. People might think that the prophet had had the tablets faked by a craftsperson but, if the returnee was charismatic enough, they would be believed. So any happening that resulted in the appearance of solid objects would not be mistaken for a hallucination. You could object that they also suffered from mass hallucinations and they all imagined the tablets, but if that was the case no-one would ever have any clue what was going on. It would be like living in a mental institution. The fabric of society would break down. Either that or the whole of existence could be one big hallucination (a possibility) in which case it would probably have its own laws of physics and so be predictable. Much like our own world in fact. 

It's the future and oil resources have run out. A scientist has suggested using personal fart power to meet our individual power needs. World governments are seriously considering this. They have identified a strain of genetically-modified bean that is easy to grow and results in an incredible degree of flatulence. Additionally they are developing some 'friendly' bacteria that show signs of being able to fartify pretty much every kind of foodstuff. Crucially it doesn't produce smelly farts - just very voluminous and flammable ones. A study is in progress whereby volunteers are wearing fart-packs strapped to their rear ends whilst driving, and these are connected to their car engines. At the moment the fart gas is being used to supplement the conventional fuel. However the scientists hope eventually to power cars entirely by the farts of the driver and passengers. Other applications are in the pipeline. How workable is this? How would society react? Bearing in mind that, with the new bacteria, the smell is negligible and also that the equipment is designed not to let the farts escape into the atmosphere, what would be the downsides? 

I'm assuming that the image can be light emitting rather than simply light-reflecting. Any normal video or picture on a computer monitor is light emitting. The victim is instructed to look at the image. It is a very large image occupying much of a wall. The pixels are in fact lasers. To begin with their intensity is kept to a minimum. As soon as the victim is standing in the right place looking at the picture the intensity of the lasers is turned up to eleven. Two of the lasers are directed into the eyes to blind the person. However the rest are all focused on the external carotid arteries. The blinded and disoriented person has no chance of stopping the blood flow and bleeds to death.
