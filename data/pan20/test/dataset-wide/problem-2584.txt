A woman can become a Buddha in a future birth. Gautama the Buddha was once a woman when 1st thought becoming a Buddha was planted in her mind. [p8 Practising the Dhamma with a View to Nibbana, Ch1 Eminent Buddhist Women by Karma Lekshe Tsomo] The Bodhisattva and Buddhas are always male so you have to be born in latter lives as a male to complete your Bodhisattva career and become a Buddha. After the definite prediction of future Buddhahood you will always be male. Before that there is a chance Bodhisattva may change between male and female. Though is modern times this might seem controversial Bahu Dhātuka Sutta mentions certain things a woman cannot achieve: 

More you meditate less sleep you need. The need for sleep is based on how energetic you are. Meditation stirs up more energy and you become energetic.

Everyone is fooled. We are also ways fooled by stimuli which is in short ignorance (or miss identifying or perceiving what is felt). We choose not to see that it will end. We attach a false sense of permanence. These are distortions of reality. (Vipallasa Sutta) 

Being ignorant of the repercussions is the very reason what we accumulate Karma which will give future experiences which the receiver perceive as unfavourable or painful, hence this this sense it can be considered a sin.

The people who have done the most for you are your parents. Also if you take a Buddha he has done lot of work in fulfilling the Paramis for our sake. Hence any actions against such a person from you have benefited would mean we should generate a lot of negativity. Buddha and Arahat are enlightened hence their mind is pure and full of compassion to others. With regard to parents also this is the case when it comes to children. Hence going against someone who loves you and is compassionate towards you generates a lot of bad karma. In this case something we cannot overcome in this life time. The Buddha has put in lot of effort to create the Sasana so doing anything incremental to this generates a loot of bad karma as we are going against the will of one of the purest minds and decrementing the possibility of other getting benefit from the efforts of the Buddha. Like wise schism generates a lot of negativity. 

In addition the commentarial literature has the 5 antaradhāna which is mentioned in another answer. They are: 

Even mercy killing is considered bad and also breaks the precepts. The dog is going through its pain due to karma. Say you kill it and goes to a worst hellish state by killing it you are putting to a far worse experience. If you treat the dog's wounds and try to heal it you are creating good karma for yourself and also easing the pain for the dog. This is be best avenue to consider. 

Under the 10 recollections there is a Kammaṭṭhāna which is recollection or death. This is can be used to develop spiritual urgency. This is similar to the near death experience, which changes the priories in a person. Upajjhatthana Sutta and related Suttas discuss in more detail. In my opinion, you should place the attention on the spot (between your nose and upper lip) and start the breath meditation upto the 1st 3 steps in the 1st tetrad. Then with each in and out breath contemplate you might not live to have the next breaths. You are growing older with each breath passing away. You do not know what calamity (death, illness, accident, death or parting of a loved one, etc.) might befall you in the next moment. This fuels some level or urgency either spiritual or in other activities in life. 

Source: Dhammapada Verse 5 Kalayakkhini Vatthu In Buddhism forgiveness is between one another than by an external agency. Having said this no external agency is behind Karma. It is only your tainted or pure mind. And once done the results follow. 

One part of your bodily sensations are due to food we take. Light vegetarian food can help concentration and meditation including Metta. This is beneficial but not necessary. Buddhism is not an extreme ideology and centres around intention. If you do not have the intention of killing and also the situation is not such what you would be tainted by the guilt that an animal was killed on by behalf, then there is nothing wrong to eat non Veg. food. The main thing is keeping your mind pure and conducive to meditate hence if you find yourself uneasy or guilty about eating non Veg. food then it will be beneficial to give up. But if you are a monk you have no choice but accept what has been offered. 

Sloth and torpor => large areas, effort directed towards see arising and passing of phenomena in an area, mental movements, mental chattering / contemplations, physical movement / walking meditation, light Also in higher stages of Breath meditation you can experience Passadhi or equanimity which there is hardly any sensation and perhaps the breathing stops. 

I am not sure if there is Sutta which mentions this but the following does have something like what you mentioned above which is called the 5 perception (pañca saññā) which appear in Metta,sahagata Sutta (quotation below), Indriya Bhāvanā Sutta, Tikandaki Sutta, etc. 

Do to Metta Bhavana you should wish everyone well from Bottom of your heart. The objective of this is to: 

As long as you have been diligent and taught the right way and tries to correct misunderstanding then what can you do? It is not your fault. Make sure you do not contribute to the disappearance of the Dhamma. See: Sugata Vinaya Sutta, Candûpama Sutta and others which deal with decline of the Dhamma and impure ways to teach.
