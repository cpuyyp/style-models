You would need to cost it out, as it pretty much comes down to the dollars cents. With a wheel at that price point its worth considering a rebuild, presuming you have a good wheel builder at your LBS. If you buy a new wheel, ensure the cost includes having the new wheel tuned up by the LBS. (If you not buying through a shop, add the cost having a shop tune it when it arrives). Unless the hub has low miles, consider a full service with new bearings, or at least put the cost of this into the rebuild of the wheel. In terms of if its worth it, you may decide reusing the hub rather than adding it to a landfill adds to the worth of a rebuild over a new wheel. 

With the lower to mid range bikes I believe they use Alloy for all frames. 900/910/920 in some ranges (e.g. Scale and Spark) are Carbon and there are a couple of different frames in these high end products, so you need to do homework to know the differences. Lower end bikes such as 960 are Alloy, which I understand is the same frame speced with different components. In the soft tails - such as the Spark, the mid range use an alloy rear triangle and carbon main frame. 

There is significant debate over the statistical benefit of wearing a helmet or not. My guess is most of use wear a helmet just in case the "Helmets are safer' camp is right but wonder if they really are. I cannot imagine the difference between helmets from a safety perspective being statistically significant. "Road. XC etc are just marketing terms - the helmets meet standards, and these tell you how much protection you get. Much better to sell two helmets and make twice the profit, easy to do by making them look different enough that peer pressure has people buying a helmet for every task - I bet someone sells a "Commuter" helmet and a "Bike Courier" helmet somewhere. You have not mentioned the most important aspect of helmet purchase - fit. A helmet that fits you is significantly better than any stickers as to what standards it meets. Presuming then you are choosing from a range of helmets that meet published safety standards, and are happy with the manufacturer as far as their honesty around this (Many standards are declarations of conformance rather than independently tested), choose a helmet that fits first, and has the features you are after second. 

Yes - Altus are a step up from the Tourney lineup, but is considered a very entry level MTB product. I would encourage you to consider a higher spec model if you can afford it - I suspect the price difference will be small if you shop around. Derailleurs are rated by the capacity and maximum tooth size. As you are run a x1 setup, you capacity requirement is 22-16 = 6, and the maximum tooth size of 22 is smaller than a typical road cluster, so any derailleur will do the job. As such, using a short cage will give better performance. You don't say what spacing the three cogs are - If you are using an indexed shifter make sure it matches the cog spacing of your cluster. As always Sheldon Brown has all the info you need 

Ever had that "this has to.... be the top.... oh sh$%.... it's a crest.... there's more...." feeling. Knowing altitude lets you pace your climb and arrive the the top without over (or under) doing it. Imagine riding flat roads without knowing speed or distance - it can be done, but to maximize training effort or race performance you need to know speed/distance on the flat and altitude/climb rate on the hills. 

Remove the wheel from the bike and check the freewheel. It should be moving freely in one direction and locked up in the other Check the rear derailleur - is the chain running freely though it. If not, check the chain line and make sure the small sprockets are free spinning. Check the chain line though the front end. Is the chain clear of the derailleur and sitting properly on the chain ring. Spin the pedals and check the bottom bracket is not jammed up somehow. check the pedals and cranks are properly aligned and attached to the bottom bracket. 

Pretty much been done to death with evangelistic enthusiasm on many forums. Smaller wheels - more agile and responsive, lighter/stronger, easier to control Larger Wheels - roll better over small obstacles therefore considered faster in straight lines, lower tire pressures (due bigger tire) provide more traction off paved roads. Slower to accelerate (debatable how much the difference really is) due more rolling weight. Don't for 650's - between 26" and 29" I grew up on 26", and switched to 29er a few years ago, my wife recently got a 650B. On the road the 29er is better, on tight, technical (i.e. have to slow down significantly into corners then accelerate) the 26" has it all over the 29'er in every way. My current preference is my wife's 650B as it suits my current riding best, but bike geometry probably plays as big a part. You height will play a part - I would not recommend a 29er for someone under about 165cm. 

You may want to read up on how to tune a rear derailluer, but if you just want to get going, all that is needed is a minor adjustment using the barrel screw (clearly seen in the video) where the cable comes in. Turn the screw clockwise 1/4 turn at a time, and the chain will move away from the cog (The cassette is the full set of cogs). Trick is not to make big adjustments - no more than 1/4 turn at a time, and count the turns so you can go back to where you started. Once this is just clearing and not catching, check the gears are all working properly. Sometimes, especially with cheaper bikes and old worn out gears, its not possible to get it perfect, and you need to compromise a bit. 

I definitely does hurt relations, however legalizing it will make limited difference. Legalizing it would be equivalent to the euthanasia debate, however Darwinism theory lends some support to the idea of legalizing it for those who have not yet procreated. The "claim of right" (a legal defense in some countries where you can do illegal stuff if you truly believe it is for a greater good), is probably around it is safer for the cyclist to clear the intersection ahead of the cars and allows the traffic freer flow etc - something that is supported in some jurisdictions by special lights and road rules. It sort of fails when you consider the safety issue of what happens when a cyclist is T-boned by a couple of tons of steel racing to (illegally, but the result is the same so its irrelevant) clear an intersection. 

Pro XC racers often like a responsive bike. 'Twitchy' in the hands of a pro is fast. My guess is you are used to the 29er and the new bike is a 650B - 29ers like straight lines and turn like beached whales. If you are used to a 29er, anything remotely responsive will feel twitchy and take a bit of getting used to. I had the opposite problem moving from 26 - 29er - same end result - crashes and swearing for the first few rides. There are things you can do nothing about -geometry, wheel size, things that cost a fortune to change - fork rake, and low cost fixes. Low cost fixes I would look to first are stem length (Increase to reduce responsiveness) and wider handle bars. Tires and tire pressure..... Zero cost fix is to keep with the bike till you get used to it... Edit: Play with shock set up and tire pressures and see if it helps. "Twitchy" could be too much rebound (not enough rebound dampening) - are you experienced enough to have a feel of how the shock/tire/track interactions are working? Its really hard to provide an answer as there are so many things we cannot know about you, the bike set-up, the trails you ride etc. In the end the fastest way to a solution is visit your LBS and get a bike fit, explaining your problem. A good bike shop will be able to sort you out, or at least, tell you what is wrong. 

Effects of age would be initially be the most important issue to think about. Brake pads (presuming rim brakes) harden and lose effectiveness. These are cheap, easy to replace and safety critical - at 9 years old, I would suggest should be replaced. Tires are similar, the rubber can harden and crack. If they look ok, use the bike but do keep a close eye on them as old tires can look great one ride and fall apart then next. Cables are possibly corroded and stiff, affecting braking and shifting performance. If there is is any doubt about cables, especially with brake cables, replace them (cheap and not too hard to do) Rust is obvious, and dried grease on headset and bottom bracket may cause some minor, but not safety, issues. For the rest, look at the answer by @Daniel 

If you are inclined to think about other people, social norms and whats considered acceptable then Lycra is not the best clothing in some situations. If you don't give a hoot what people think of you, lycra it is fine in most situations. (This comes to mind..... Non- cyclists don't really cares about Lycra or not when you are on the bike (togs). Its off the bike it counts when Lycra looks the same as underwear to most people (undies). 

The calliper and pad choices are more important than the disk as far as performance. Bigger discs increase performance cheaper than better callipers. At some point, bigger discs are needed to get enough performance, but mostly disc size choice is about the cost vs weight trade off. In your case, I expect the current 180F/160R is a nice balance of cost and performance. Better callipers and 160 on the front would save grams but either loose performance or cost $$$. 180 on the rear (if it fits) wont help much with braking power, so the cost to change is pointless Given the front and back wheels are not interchangeable, there is no disadvantage of different size discs. As such, its probably a lot easier (and cheaper) for you to keep your existing discs 

My guess is cords were damaged on the ride creating a weak spot. Threads held together long enough to get you home and a bit longer, then ripped apart. This kind of delayed and catastrophic failure is not uncommon. Heating vent might have softened them enough to make a difference, but the tire was damaged anyway (assuming warm, not very hot air). More puncture resistant tires may help prevent it in the future, but you cannot prevent it completely. The size of the hole in the tire, and the hole in the tube are irrelevant, its a symptom of the tire failure, not the cause. Once the tire fails, there is nothing stopping the air pressure inside the tube expanding - the tube cannot stop it, it gets pushed though the tire, making that hole bigger and blows up and pops just like a balloon, hence the bang. If you were listening closely, the bang was preceded by a short ripping sound. 

If you are a casual weekend warrior like me, you got to the LBS, ask them for a tire for the trails you regularly ride (which they should know) and hope they gave you something half decent. 

I am talking about Electric assist MTB's (typically under 250W), not electric MX bikes. The ones in the middle (MTB's with 1000W motors) are really a new style MX/MTB hybrid bike that cause the most debate. Not everyone is healthy and fit enough to enjoy, or even attempt some of the best MTB rides. Electric MTB's enable a greater proportion of the population to participate in a fantastic sport and not be relegated to the boring, short, flat tracks built for beginners. What if I want to share my mountain biking experience with my 70 year old father, or 12 year old son, or 120kg couch potato best mate, and electric bike is the best (and sometimes only) way they will enjoy the experience. What happens when I, as a keen MTBer, get too old to ride my favorite trails? Whats wrong with evening up the field by allowing those less capable to use electric assist (how does it differ from Golf Handicaps). Perhaps in teh next few years we will start to conversations at bike races around around "Whats your handicap... 20 Watts- whoo, your good, mines 50". The only concerns I hear on Electric MTB's mostly come from young men , who are still fit and healthy and not had their first knee or hip replacement, and have the liability of too much testosterone. They argue all the same arguments, once used by walkers and hikers to try and keep mountain bikes on the road, that Electric Assist bikes are the devils spawn and hell will freeze over if unfit blobs are allowed on the trails. What does need to be considered is while the assistance allows you to go further and longer, it does not always translate to faster. The weight of E-Bikes is high enough to affect their agility, it would take a very skilled rider to ride an EBike fast over technical, tight single track. There are some invalid concerns about tracks getting destroyed used as arguments against EBikes.
