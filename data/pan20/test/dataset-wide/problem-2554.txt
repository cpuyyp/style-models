There is no universal Buddhist funeral but some customs have developed in Buddhist countries around Buddhism. Following may be of some help: 

This is the practice aimed at developing insight before wisdom. Ideally you should aim a system of practice which both can develop but taking a natural course in which develops first as both are needed. E.g. practice of Anapana. 

Whatever addressed to monks and applicable and relevant to laypeople also. Whether you are in robes or not you get stressed and getting out of stress you get peace. When the Buddha addresses as Bhikkhu this includes lay people. 

Remove any sensations triggering the negative thoughts and emotions. Break the polifration of thoughts due re enforcement of sensations created by the irritating from previous thoughts by replacing the sensations with Piti Dissolve the formations and lighten the Karmic effects of the negative emotions. 

More effort and energy you put into it lesser distraction you will get from external distraction going forward. Being mightful about the breath should be inline with the techniques in Anapanasati Sutta to get the benefits. Also if your mind gets distracted then you have to: 

Well this form of meditation is not well established or part of the more common meditation object but Bhanthe Vimalasiri does teach forgiveness meditation. The instructions are here: $URL$ 

The Importance of Vedana and Sampajanna in Vipassana Meditation by VRI The pleasure or gratification one gets from sense objects are temporary and end in unsatisfactoriness when it changes. By not seeking pleasure in temporary things you are trading lesser pleasure for a more lasting and higher pleasure of Nirvana. Until you get there at least you are not in emotional rollercoaster if you see impermanence. Not seeking pleasure is that you do not react to sensations mentally noting their impermanence. For house holders the the restain one should practice is the 5 precepts. You can seek pleasurable things within this confine. But while doing that if you practice insight a time will come where you will start giving up on things you might consider thrill seeking. But this should be a gradual process. This should not be an ideological or philosophical belief that you should give up on such activities, in which case it is attachment to a concept or ideal, which on itself in not ideal as it will result in misery. 

Accumulation of merit will only give favorable conditions. If you are born and able bodied person and the ability to access the dhamma this purpose is already served. If you miss this opportunity the conditions perhap many not be as favorable again for a long time. So practice hard to achieve the final goal. This effort will not be in vain as if you miss the goal in this life your most likely be in a more favorable position to practice and also your past practice will help with help mastering the teachings and technique easily. 

If you commit any of the 1st 5 (panchanathariya) you still can liberate your self from Samsara. If you have committed the 5 grave offenses, you will get definite results in the next birth. Most likely result is that you will be born in Avichi Hell. (Ajasath being a exception after doing so much good after words. ) At some stage this karma will end and by practicing the Dhamma you can come out of Samsara. If you hold on to wrong views and do not practice the Dhamma. Then there is no way out of Samsara. In order to practice of course your should have confidence in the teacher, the practice and your ability to practice and get results. If your faith is else where your will not practice the path leading you out of Samsara (you will be going something else instead), hence will be struck in it for ever, even though someone have done a grave offence in a part life can get enlightened in a later life getting inspired to practice the right path leading out of Samsara. 

You don't have to defend Buddhism. There is no deity to offend. Sure, pay your respects to Buddha as a great teacher, but you should do the same for everyone anyway. But I digress. So to sum it up: No, Buddha doesn't shelter you from offence. Offence doesn't exist, only your perception of it. If you choose that something will be offensive it will be offensive. Only you have the control over that, never the person "being" offensive. Buddha doesn't shelter you. He handed us the tools and an instruction manual. It is up to us to use them to the best of our abilities. "Taking refuge" in the Buddha doesn't mean hiding under his arm. It means trying what he taught and discovering reality for the first time. 

I guess the biggest difference is imposed by those that aren't either a beggar or a monk: "I see you as a monk, therefore you are allowed here. I see you as a dropout from society as therefore you aren't allowed here." The monk may have more knowledge of the Dhamma, and may live his life according to it, but who's to say the homeless person doesn't? He may be a devout Buddhist, which is why he was drawn to stay in the temple. The label of "homeless person" comes associated with a whole host of negative connotations. A monk is a "homeless person". He chooses to gather (as Buddha suggested) with others of the right mind (Right Association). By coming to the temple, is not this other "homeless" person merely enacting Right Association? Kudos to him/her, I say. 

In this case I think we can associate "human" with "higher power or morality" - be that suttas, kamma, laws, or whatever. 

You should have at least a copy of the Dhammapada. I would also recommend "In the Buddha's Words" (978-0-86171-491-9). I'd also recommend subscribing to BSWA (Buddhist Society of Western Australia) on Youtube. They broadcast all their dhamma talks and sutta classes, as well as guided meditations. A brilliant resource for the beginner and more advanced alike (as long as you don't mind Ajahn Brahm's corny jokes). 

The best posture? Simple: The posture that is most comfortable and affords the least distractions to your mind (aches, pains, etc). 

Also that you take offence with/at something? Offence is only ever taken, never given. In other words, it is your choice to be offended by something or someone. Most offence is "taken" when someone talks about something about yourself that you aren't comfortable with or disparages a view our belief that you hold and aren't necessarily OK with and you feel the need to violently defend it. The offence comes from your own insecurities, not the malice of the other person. That's not to say they may not have intended malice, but the offence you take comes from you not them. If you truly accept who and what you are it is impossible for anyone to offend you. It is often said it is impossible to offend a Buddhist. And it's true. Not through any great stoicism, but because they know exactly who and what they are. And they choose not to take offence. People say I'm fat, and I am. I know that, and I accept that. I have tried losing weight, but it hasn't worked. Many times. But that's fine. I am what I am, and no one can offend or upset me by calling me fat. They're just stating the obvious. The best way, if someone intends malice, of completely removing that malice is to turn it into a joke and completely reverse it. If you accept yourself for who you are you can laugh at yourself with impunity. And in laughing at yourself any malice intended is instantly gone. So much suffering in this world is caused by people's insecurities. Mostly their religious insecurities. Wars are fought over inconsequentialities. And all because religious views are so tenuous and fragile and easy to offend. That's why there has never been a holy war in the name of Buddhism. We are comfortable with what we are. You can't threaten our beliefs because they aren't based on faith in some beard in the sky. And that's what sets Buddhism apart from every other religion in the world. Buddha basically said (and I'm paraphrasing here): 

I use a form of concentration practice called zhine that is used in Tibetan dream yoga. It is similar to kasina, in that it involves sitting and staring at a little coloured disc. You're supposed to keep your eyes from blinking and gaze constantly at the disc. If the eyes move it's very noticeable! But, you do learn to deal with it effectively. What I have noticed is that the movements of my eyes correspond with movements in my mind. As I become more concentrated, my eyes move less. The eyes are the windows to the soul, after all. (Note: the eyes are constantly moving, but in very small, generally imperceptible ways. Just to be clear, I'm referring to the movements that we would actually call movements in general life.) I also find that when "on the precipice" before a deeper level of concentration, extra mental energy occurs. I think this is because the energy being wasted in unconcentrated mental activity becomes available as that activity ends. It feels good and can manifest as joy, and/or can be overwhelming and distracting. If I make an effort then these changes are not distracting and actual form the basis for entering the next level. Greater mental energy allied with good focus are, naturally, what you'd require for a deeper level, so it would seem to follow. The main thing I try to remember is that it is not the goal to become concentrated, it is the goal to practise concentration. Concentration is a by-product of concentration practice. Just as stronger muscles are by-product of physical exercise. What's important in both is to focus on a) doing it, and b) following the correct technique. Nowhere have I ever seen a practice include the directive "and when you lose concentration, become annoyed with yourself". Distraction is normal, all you need to do is to be aware you've lost some focus, and then refocus. Hope that helps. 

I'm being a tad simplistic in the depiction of the flavours of Buddhism, but the main thing is, it works as an explanation. Once you know to separate out the framework from the religion it's easy to see why it gets confused as a philosophy by some and a religion by others. 

I'd add to that, that the main difference between a philosophy and a framework is that a framework provides or suggests tools/methods based on its philosophy. Buddhism the framework is the 4 Noble Truths, a collection of observations and logical conclusions (the first 3 "truths") with the methods/tools supplied in the 4th Noble Truth. To accept/follow/implement the 4 Noble Truths is what makes something "Buddhist" - not just for a person but for any system of thought, including religions. Several religions have incorporated this and become Buddhist religions: 

When most people use the word "think" they are referring to discursive thoughts, and these are the ones you mention, but thinking is more than that. On a neurological level, you're (obviously) capable of doing several things at once. Not all the systems rely on others to work - you don't need to think discursive thoughts to breathe, but it does rely on mental activity (you won't be doing much breathing after death;) It is quite possible that discursive thought has no effect on physical actions directly, but it is eminently possible that it can have the effect of removing attention from what is being done, and in performing actions attention is incredibly important If you are well concentrated then discursive thought would not be a problem, but also, it will be less likely to arise of its own accord, and is probably unnecessary. (Right) Intention will drive attention, and attention will aid the quality.
