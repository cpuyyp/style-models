Actually you needn't send over the whole mass converted to energy; the relevant information should be sent instead. A reasonable account of problems can be found here. In general there are a lot of theoretical problems with teleportation, including possibility of duplicates, precision errors due to several cause (including Heisenberg Indetermination Principle). Mass conversion to radiant energy poses a lot of engineering problems due to sheer amount of energy involved (if memory assists Hiroshima bomb converted to energy less than a milligram of matter), but not only: recoil from sending such a quantity of photons in a single direction would deorbit a fairly-sized asteroid. 

It all depends on actual engine technology used. If reliable and cheap enough (better than SpaceX) the benefits, from military point of view, are: 

It is very difficult to imagine higher degrees of symmetry because of specialization. On Earth we have several Classes (Coelenterata come to mind) that have higher symmetries, but they are invariably at "low end" of complexity with a very rudimentary nervous system. Note these animals do not have a "brain" but rely on distributed nerve ganglia. As soon as complexity rises we see two things happening: 

As you say 100% is a very difficult number to get when target is planetary big. There are, however, several possibilities to get very close to that, depending on the kind of catastrophe you are willing to pull unto the unsuspecting planet. 

Utopias are such because they are very nice ideas that go against what is our ingrained instincts. All tentatives to go in that direction inevitably find some "unexpected" side effect frustrating the purpose. Your Utopia is no exception. Even allowing there's some way to do what you propose (currently there is not and we have no idea if and when that could become feasible (likely answers are "no" and "never")), the first problem that comes to mind is: "who controls the process"? Any system can be controlled, hacked, has backdoors or, simply is governed by some humans; who will prevent the generic Joe Programmer to rewire system to put himself (and, possibly, some friends) into the wealthiest bodies that are around? Even admitting the system is perfect and really randomizing, how can a society work when people is swapped around and a medical doctor is inhabited by a woodcarver or a priest? Even if you manage to sort out such problems there remains the ultimate: nobody would have the reason to work hard and you would get a mass of Socialist Workers with no real push and no real future. Sorry. 

I'm not completely sure I understand what you want from us, but perhaps this could help, otherwise correct me via comments. I will repeat in a very abstract way what (I understood about what) you described: 

Assuming such a thing (the 10x speedup, I mean) is actually possible it would mean signals on neurons travel much faster and synaptic neurotransmitters bridge the gap in (much) less time. In such a situation, even if bone/muscle infrastructure doesn't change much, it is very likely such a (super)man would be able to pick an arrow in flight. As noted in comments there already are people who, through long training, are able to stop an arrow. These men, however, are pulling the feat in a completely different way. They, through training, learn exactly how much time it will take the arrow to be in the right position and send their hand to the "meeting point" just in time, like a pianist sending his fingers to hit keys in the exact time frame. Fact is all these (and many other) gestures are "open loop": brain evaluates situation and start gesture; after that it's not possible to modify gesture because, simply, there's no time for feedback to go back to brain. A sizable signal speedup, like that you envision, would completely change the game and allow direct feedback. This means gestures can be more precise and "reasoned" (in the sense gesture can be modified "on the flight"). Note: this speedup could allow arrow-stopping to be used in actual combat situation; what "normal(??) human" arrow catchers rely on is exact knowledge of where the arrow is going (archer is compliant), it wouldn't be possible if archer is free to chose his target. 

It is difficult to give an idea if You don't develop some infrastructure first. In general I would think to something like a series of "apartments" with balconies for take off and landing. Something like this :) Wealthy people would live in the upper floors where they can reach the skies without need to escalate the busy canyons between buildings. Problem with this setup is Roman Empire technology required heavy tooling difficult to transport in flight. In fact also Roman products (warfare and other things) tend to be heavy and unsuited for use by flying creatures (most likely obsessed with lightweight); something like the "eggshell ceramic" from ancient China would be better. Did they invent the wheel? Do they have carriages? Who pulls them? animals? Are they plying oxpecker? If so then You need some ramps at least in the lower layers of the "urban cliffs". In general You need to think a bit better this society which is bound to be much different from what we know and surely different from Roman Empire ;) 

If you do not change atmosphere and get higher polar temperatures just by increasing sunlight you may have problems: 

From there evolution of "sex" as we know it is a "natural consequence", but may well not be the only possible consequence. So the answer is: Yes, it's conceivable to have beings exchanging genetic material in a "aequalitarian" basis, but what it could be is really pure speculation and I won't venture in it. 

First attempt would surely be to use hand signaling, while not really a deaf language (they are not deaf, after all) it would evolve into one quite rapidly. This, especially in combat situation, has many drawbacks and would quickly be complemented with some kind of acoustic signals; many armies still have a well defined set of signals given with trumpet or whistles (these are nowadays reminiscence of the ancient times when orders on the battlefields were given exclusively with such means, so your medieval world should already have them). These predefined signals would likely be augmented to cope with present situation. 

I suspect You may find of interest this Answer to a similar question (I'm unsure if I should mark this Question as a duplicate). General idea is saddle depends on usage and relative size between mount and rider. If You are using a predatory animal as mount I suppose you want to go to battle and thus you'll also want to use as much as possible you'r mount's offensive power. This would mean you should move saddle front in order to weigh over shoulder blades with direct support of forelegs and have some kind of retention for rider legs to avoid disastrous falls when mount leaps or rises on hind legs to fight. You also might need some effective way to prevent tendency of cats (if mount is a cat) to roll over in a fight. 

Wormholes are not in the realm of science, even though science doesn't forbid them. Is it thus impossible to say what would really happen if and when such a technology would become available. One safe bet, however, would be Newton still holds true: this means the projectile would emerge with the same speed vector. Positioning accurately the wormholes endpoints it would thus be possible to "aim" incoming projectiles with correspondingly high accuracy. 

Hydroponic and similar techniques need a lot of water very careful dosage of nutrients in it. They are suited to carefully controlled environment and to avoid contamination. They are (normally) used in "factories" where everything is artificial and controlled, including sunlight. If you have that much water and fertilizer your best bet is to setup normal soil cultivations, possibly in a greenhouse to minimize water dispersion. You would gain nothing from hydroponics, while needing a stricter control. 

You asked for science-based and reality-check, so You can't really travel through time and parallel universes are unlikely at best. If You want your character to get his wife back IMHO You have two options: 

Actually the root reason why there is a male favoring in most of "modern" societies is connected with the (wrong!) idea the female is "just" a (hopefully fertile) field male has to "inseminate". The discovery sexual act is needed to procreation completely overturned balance from matriarchal societies to patriarchal ones; if you add to this that, till very recent times, women needed males for muscle and protection (males were expendable! see: "women and children first!") the idea a male son would "continue the lineage" much better than a female is clear and "obvious". As nothing of this is actually true (surely not the biologic part, but also the need for stronger muscles is not so felt anymore; as RAH once said: "wheels under luggage did more for women freedom than all suffragettes"), the customs are slowly changing (note: dowry, now alive almost only in India, was a worldwide custom no more than a century ago) just follow the path and differences will be watered down to oblivion (but it could take centuries!). What You need to do to have a female-preferring world is to revert again child "ownership" giving women complete control not only over when and how to give birth to a child, but also to his/her nurture... it could really suffice just return to matrilinear families (child takes the surname of the mother). All the rest would follow naturally. 

Unless you plan to suspend Newton's Third Law (with an enormous dose of wandwavium) or you will have the Gravity Generator pulled in the opposite direction of ship internals, with exactly the same force. Net effect should be null (otherwise you could use this effect to accelerate the ship without reaction mass). If you have the G.Generator solidly fixed to spaceship You won't have any course deflection as the two pulls will even out. 

Many (if not all) plants in our Earth adapted to season cycle, it's not the other way around. This means that, unless you are thinking of "straightening" our world axis, somehow, the plants in that world would have adapted to the no-seasons situation. It is unclear (to me) what You exactly need: 

I am assuming you're not really meaning "all metals" because they compose the vast majority of the Periodic Table; I assume there's scarcity of some metals, namely: Al Fe Cu Zn Sn Pb. Most likely technical history of a world with low metal resources would diverge right at "bronze age". It is very difficult to guess what "would have happened" with any degree of confidence, but I can give a few ideas: 

Fossil fuels are central to the way we actually booted our Industrial Revolution. Without them the path we followed simply wouldn't be there. It is difficult to "foresee" (strange word, when applied to the past ;) ) what would have been the path in that case. A few considerations apply: 

No. If You see the "sun" (however eclipsed) you cannot see the cone of shadow projected by the planet where you stand (it's below the horizon), so you cannot see the eclipsed moon and vice versa. You could see both eclipses from a third body, but then the body from where you see the solar eclipse is not the same eclipsing the second moon. You need four bodies (plus the star). 

There is a third plot alternative: you don't want any of the devices to be found (presumably to avoid incrimination); in this case you should minimize the number and keep them together (as in the first case (pun intended)). 

Bottom line: If You can define "good government" then there's a good chance computers will, in a reasonable future, do it better than humans, otherwise we'll have to wait till some AI is smart enough to devise definition itself (hoping it won't decide it can do without all humans altogether, of course) 

One of the simplest ways is to let Homo Sapiens continue his current job and hope to have something better than cockroaches among survivors. ... but this may not be what You're looking for ;) It really depends on what You need for your plot. If you need "natural events" then asteroid hit, huge supervolcano eruption or a global pandemic are good candidates. If you want something willingly done You can think about a gang of super-terrorists targeting all oil production sites at once (or some other way to have oil production stop). Strategic reserves will last few months and in the meantime global transports would come to a grinding halt with a terrifying domino-effect (almost no country in the world is self-sufficient to feed its own population, even countries that are (e.g.: U.S.) would be hard pressed to maintain the same production levels without oil). Rogue A.I. is not really out of the way. For generic "good reasons" for Civilization to fall see also Wikipedia 

The suggested "cure": lower (a lot!) surface gravity (i.e.: have either a smaller planet or a lighter core... or both) is mandatory in your case because mountains "several hundred vertical miles" would otherwise collapse under their own weight and thin air is the last of your (scientific) concerns. There are good geological reasons why tallest peak on Mars (mt.Olympus) is significantly (>20%) taller than any Earth counterpart. What you propose is quite extreme and I sincerely do not think is achievable without resorting to some "magic". What You should be concerned, though are other factors I don't know if You accounted for: 

Since the women in your setup do not need a male to create a fertile egg you think to be in trouble with biodiversity (including how to produce a male). This would be true with straight parthenogenesis, but you state pregnancy needs magical interaction with "aether" and during the whole period you have a very strong spell running. Solution is to postulate that when starting the spell mother sends to ether a copy of her genetic material (or half of it, if that suits better to your plot) and receives back a new set to be inserted in the egg. This way you can control how much of the genetic material will be changed merging it with genes floating in the "aether". As a special twist you can say very strong sorceress can "protect" their genes getting a copy almost identical, while "less gifted" women get a random copy, perhaps even very different from the original. Process can also be influenced by "feelings" of the male, which may have an indirect influence on gene selection, either conscientiously or not (depends on plot). Many variations on the theme are possible. Have fun! EDITED TO INCLUDE COMMENTS FROM OP Conception is a very powerful spell that lasts (at least) till childbirth and it consists in several phases: 

IMHO you are trying to reconcile two things that are not reconcilable. In order to have small "free" communities you have to make them self sufficient and that means they should own their own equipment, otherwise they will always be dependent on whoever (literally!) own the air they breath. OTOH, once you stipulate spatial and temporal separation (long and somewhat dangerous travels) you will almost automatically get competing individuals/small communities. Dropping transport costs (goods, people and information) inevitably leads to "globalization" where larger companies will always have an edge on smaller ones. Multiple competing "firms" can only exist in a fragmented world. No amount of legislative effort can prevent people from doing what is economically favorable for extended periods of time. In a system where travel/transport costs are low there is space for very few entities occupying the same niche. I suggest You have a situation where colonies were started via unmanned, auto-replicating factories that replicated so well (before their owners would realize the danger) that certain basic commodities are essentially free so colonists could concentrate on developing higher return products which can be traded over long (and somewhat dangerous) routes. 

It heavily depends on local climate, but bottom of a N/S crevice half a mile high by one mile wide would get very little direct little sunshine (around midday); this means having your wastes to evaporate naturally is probably not feasible. To get water in you can rely on rain, if available, or on some (small) river flowing into the abyss. In both cases your problem is how to avoid this basin to get filled with fresh water. You can handwave it away saying the mage who prepared the Wall of Force spell made it unidirectional, so that anything leaning on it from the north side would be instantly pushed unto the south side of the wall (2500 feet under water, you need a good breath to escape that way!... not to speak about your eardrums). [Side Note: in this case you have a very nice way to produce "moto perpetuo" and get free energy just by having a pipe siphoning sea water in, use its 2500 feet drop potential energy with some kind of mill and then shove it through the wall returning it to sea; OTOH such energy might come from the spell itself, which may be weakened and, perhaps, fail after a while (if not "renewed")] Otherwise you'll need to pump it up, most likely with an Archimedes screw. Note that this freshwater-filling problem is completely independent from city. Such a closed crevice, if not in fully desert climate, is bound to be filled in reasonably short time, so Magician must have solved it when he built it, somehow.
