objectively, moral nihilism leads to careless behavior, which often leads to conflict and suffering. subjectively, adhering to good morals is a nice rule of thumb for reducing mental afflictions - while moral nihilism would give free reign to the blinding passions. Right Dharma by its very nature has to be based on reality of how things work - and being based on how things work means its principles can be observed throughout a wide range of human activities - which is why worldly ethics and Buddhism go along 90% of the way. Moral nihilism goes contrary to worldly ethics, which means it's not in accord with how things work. the entire Buddhist path is based on the idea that some states of existence are "better" (more peaceful) then others, Nirvana being "the best", with better behavior leading to better states, and better views leading to better behavior. Dharma is that "better view". To claim that moral nihilism is the right teaching would imply that moral nihilism is a better view, which is logically inconsistent, since from the standpoint of moral nihilism there cannot be such thing as "better view". our ideas and results of our actions continue to exist after our death. So whatever we do has influence beyond this life, just like we have inherited actions of previous generations. Moral nihilism denies this factor, this denial being obviously false. 

I have a very vague memory of a sutta in which Buddha mentions graceful posture, in passing. Somehow in my memory, he specifically commented on someone's manner of sitting down. He said, one should sit down slowly, not crashing down. This may be a fake memory though, could come from another source, not sutta. Buddha also gave specific instructions for behavior during an alms round. This included upright posture, looking down instead of staring or rubbernecking, not throwing one's arms randomly like a child, eating carefully etc. As far as oral tradition, the explanation goes that your posture & grace is tightly connected with one's emotional energy and the state of mind. In Vajrayana the entire emphasis of mid-to-higher tantras is on one's energy expression, so there they practice extensively to have the right type of "deity pride" including corresponding posture and mood. In my opinion, this is actually a very important part of the Teaching that deserves more attention. The three separate phenomena we call "body", "emotions" and "subconscious mind" are in fact facets of the same continuum. So the way we carry around our body, move our hands, use our facial muscles is a very direct expression of our awakening (or lack thereof). Although, for a student, the body practice is mostly about internal benefit of overcoming one's bad emotional habits, for a teacher it becomes a tool of external influence and motivation. The right posture, grace, smile, demeanor are all parts of the rainbow body experience, utilized to arouse in students confidence in their teacher and entice them to imitate and develop similar wholesome qualities of mind. 

"Treasury of Precious Qualities" by Jigme Lingpa, Volume One. A concise summary of the entire curriculum studied by Tibetan Lamas. 

Craving (lit. "thirst", ) is a technical term that means that very phenomenological moment when you (here!) daydream about something (over there!). Buddha says "unsatisfied craving IS dukkha" (suffering) - note how he does not say "craving is the cause of suffering", he says "unsatisfied craving IS". That's because dukkha isn't exactly "suffering", it should be more precisely translated as "unsatisfactoriness", or, as I sometimes translate it, "the feeling of wrongness". So as you see, to say that "unsatisfied craving IS the feeling of wrongness" is almost a truism, a statement that is obviously and self-evidently true. This way Buddha not as much identifies the cause of suffering, as illustrates the nature of suffering, brings it into light and shows it upclose so we can see it for what it is. Indeed, suffering is nothing else but the painful experience of the unsatisfied craving for another experience. As for "attachment", I feel like this is a long-standing misunderstanding that crept in since the earliest days of Buddhism, when the term / (to attend) got mixed up with (fuel). In my opinion, the sequence here is that what one craves for, one attends to, thereby fueling the craving. In other words, as you keep obsessing over the object of your craving, you only make it worse. This makes it clear that (to-attend/to-fuel, usually translated as clinging or attachment) is not really the direct cause of suffering, but only a sustaining factor. The direct cause of suffering is craving. Four Noble Truths (at leat the first three) are focused on the immediate experience of suffering, as it occurs and can be ceased in the present moment. That's why they talk about craving being the cause. The Twelve Nidanas cover the big picture: how entire experience of "I" and "The World" arises. In that context it's more appropriate to talk about Upadana being a fuel for Bhava, and Avidya being the root cause of it all. Avidya (invalid/confused understanding ~of the experience) causes reification of experience as external objects which then become the object of craving. This craving causes dukkha, sure, but more importantly for the big picture it leads to ego-centric imagination (Upadana) which leads to individuation (Bhava). I hope this analysis of the terms and how they relate to the phenomenology of suffering clarifies the topic. 

In terms of how they affect the path, obviously, these are holdbacks. The goal is to get free from them. Here is the instruction I received from my teacher about this: In meditation, when memory comes up, do not replay the event that caused the pain. Do not think about it, thoughts don't help. Instead, stay with the pain itself. Feel it in your body. Stay focused on it and get a full taste of the feeling, thoroughly. Then go inside the feeling. Accept it and feel its texture, thoroughly. Despite the pain, go all the way inside until you get out on the other side. Accept. Go through. 

Bhava-tanha is a craving to be a certain way. It's a wish or a dream of having oneself occupy a certain position in the future. This is exactly what this is, a desire to be enlightened, achieve Nirvana, become Buddha etc. 

Well the path "I" have chosen is the householder's path, as I think it is the more difficult and honest of the two. After all, how can I help people, most of whom are lay "householders", if I don't live their life? 

They are moving fast because they don't think. Acting on your non-conceptual (pre-conceptual) knowledge/wisdom/intuition is one of the most important Zen practices. So important that sometimes the word "Zen" itself is taken to mean such action. When action is mediated by thought it has an element of calculation in it, an element of doubt, an element of worrying about personal profit. Wu-wei -- literally "no action" -- actually stands for action that is not based on dualistic mind, not targeted at attaining (an egoistic) goal, it is action without an actor and therefore fast. 

First, they need to establish the right ground: that the problem is fixable, not unfixable. That they can make it worse, or they can make it better. If they repeatedly try to make it better for a long enough time, it will get better. Once they are in the right frame of reference, they should make a commitment to only acting with that goal in mind, not reacting emotionally. Every time there is a problem, they should do something that will make things better, not worse. This should be their mantra: act purposefully, try to quickly calculate the basic results of your action before you act. Specifically, in terms of what they say, they should not speak from emotion, because when they speak from emotion, they don't think clearly and can only make it worse. Everything they say should be constructive, meaning it should not just criticize but offer some positive next steps that will improve things. Same with anything else they do: going somewhere, buying something, etc. Especially if their action is motivated by the emotion of being upset/frustrated - they should force themselves to sit on their hands, or distract themselves with something, or express the negative emotion into singing or drawing or dancing or yelling in the closet - just don't do something that will make things worse. If they have some daily routines or life cycles or people influences that keep on feeding the negative patterns - then they should change the circumstances, move somewhere, get rid of those friends, stop watching those particular movies or listening to that music - in short whatever in their lifestyle is part of the nutrient for the pathological patterns should be removed. So, in summary, they should get in the habit of watching their mind for destructive intentions and replace them with constructive intentions. They can't act positively if their mind is negative - so they should get in the habit of only thinking useful thoughts, and stopping useless/negative thoughts. First, they will forget this and get carried away by the emotions - but they should keep repeating to themselves, every day, for a long long time until it gets better: "only do what will help, don't do what will make it worse" - and then with time it will become second nature. Eventually, (once they get used to NOT acting negatively) it becomes an exercise in always being in good mood. Your entire life becomes a game of accumulating good mood. The more good mood you have, the more opportunities you will see for getting even better mood, through healthy and creative means. And when you are in good mood, it becomes contagious and people around you get caught in your good mood too - and then you can help them by teaching this same principle.
