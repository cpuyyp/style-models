1) No, there are many places in the ocean that receive more sunlight hours than many deserts. For instance, the west coasts of southern Africa and central South America. These locations are influenced by the very cold antarctic currents and high pressure from Hadley cells. 2) That very much depends on location. In general, a warm ocean will be cloudier than a cold one. The equatorial waters are particularly cloudy, while subtropical waters are generally less cloudy. Meanwhile, some land areas are very cloudy much of the year. For instance, Washington state is cloudy more often than not. Mountainous regions are also often cloudy. 3) Most of the incoming reaching the Earth's surface falls on the oceans. That is mostly due to the surface area of the oceans (~2/3 of the Earth). 

the cold air advection from the north east has driven temperatures down the cloud cover traps longwave radiation sort of like a blanket, keeping the night time temperatures from dropping also, the cloud cover prevents solar radiation from reaching the surface and warming it the relative humidity is near 100%, indicating that the dew point is nearly the same as the air temperature. Dew point serves as a minimum possible temperature, so this also prevents the air temperature from dropping precipitation traveling through the lower atmosphere will evaporate, having two effects: cooling the atmosphere and maintaining a high dew point 

There are a number of factors that went/are going into the population explosion, food is only one vaccination and antibiotics are a big factor as well. within food fertilizer is again only one of many factors. Better crop strains, mechanized and better farming techniques, soil science, pesticides, refrigeration, and a dozen other factors contributed. Keep in mind artificial fertilizers get less important as you go back in time as well so calling it the detonator is incorrect and misleading. Now when considering crop rotation, crop rotation has pros and cons, there are several nutrients plants need and rotation only helps with some of them, and it relies on having compatible crops to rotate which not every crop or environment has. Keep in mind the piece wikipedia is quoting is not a peer reviewed paper but an essay in nature, which explains it is referring to several modern countries that fertilize almost exclusively with artificial fertilizers. It is not claiming they cannot use other fertilizers. 

Sonar (passive or active) or ground penetrating radar with both work, it can also be estimated from a published geologic profile of the area which are often built from both in addition to drill data. 

Basically oceanic crust is guaranteed to be reworked eventually, check the age of oceanic crust, while continental crust has a more random factor involved meaning some in the more stable regions of some continents has not been reworked. That is why they are only small scattered areas. 

(5) is only really a factor during the day when temperatures would normally be on the rise. The precipitation will keep the diurnal heating to a minimum. 

Yes, these are the correct terms. The first equation is generally termed the 'surface radiation budget' and the second the 'surface energy budget'. As @Deditos pointed out, additional terms for biological storage and flux can be added and are in fact important sources when considering a microclimate, and these would generally be placed into the surface energy budget. Another form of the first equation is Rn = ϵLW↓ − σϵT_s^4 + (1−α)SW↓ Where ϵ is the longwave emissivity of the surface, σ is the Stephan-Boltzman constant, T_s is the surface temperature, and α is the albedo (see Huber et al., section 3.2). In certain circumstances, it is useful to set them equal to each other by solving for Rn, so you may also see ϵLW↓ − σϵT_s^4 + (1−α)SW↓ = G + H + LE + (S + B) Where B is the biological flux. 

Examining two extreme cases, one very cold and the other very warm, the amount of precipitable water in the very cold one will be far less than that in the very warm one. Even fully saturated, the very cold air mass would need to be lifted quite high to form large enough ice crystals or water droplets to have enough mass to begin falling. Meanwhile, the warm air mass would produce larger droplets very quickly. Thus the warm air mass would begin to produce precipitation at a lower altitude, and with greater intensity. Because the air masses begin precipitating at different altitudes, the point of maximum intensity would also be lower for the warm air mass. 

the first one would have been the entire planet soon after it formed (~4.4 billion years), the planet had to cool quite a bit before liquid water could exist. deserts basically predate all the other climes on earth. 

It mostly has to do with three factors, numbers, fecundity, and behavior. Let's start with the last, certain behaviors that increase your chances of surviving are far more likely in smaller animals things like burrowing, and hibernation. They are also more likely to be generalists able to eat almost anything, specialization is a death sentence during a major environmental change. They also require less total amounts of food as individuals, it is far easier for a rat to find enough food to survive in a wasteland than an elephant, This is also true in comparing cold-blooded vs warm-blooded animals. Second you have numbers, there are several billion rats in NYC alone, even with the total destruction of the city it is very easy for a some rats to happen to be lucky enough to survive, small animals will die in larger numbers but there are so many of them they are more likely to have some survive. They literally have the law of large numbers in their favor. Last is reproduction, size is connected to reproduction, an elephant reproduces once every two years under ideal conditions, while a rat can breed every 24 days, so even if a few elephants do survive they repopulate so slowly they may never recover and some other minor event may finish them off. So if you combine these not only are small animals more likely to survive they can recover far faster than most large animals, so all things being equal you should expect small animals to be better at surviving and diversifying after a event. 

The full question is: Is it possible that the recent, successive, long droughts from Australia to the West Coast of both American continents are signs of epic crust failure? The question is aimed specifically at the possible link between droughts at those specific areas and the weakening/loosening of lateral stress between tectonic plates. The reasoning is based on the following observations: 

The crust is not rooted in the mantle, and is cut in numerous crustal plates. Tectonic plates are held in place like an arch, so the gravity and lateral stress and friction are the main forces holding them up. Mantle flow provides uneven support to continental plates and is actually the main destabilizing force according to current theories. Based on the idea above, if humans dig up too much underground materials around the fault lines, the edges of the fault lines are weakened: there is less material to keep up adequate lateral stress. Then, the soil around the softer/weaker side of the fault will deform and be compacted, or fail and result in earthquake. Deformation/compaction and fault failure do happen naturally too, but humans may have extracted too much underground resources for the natural healing process to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. It is known that the fault of the West Coast is lacking stress and the soil is deformed in the Amos et al. (2014) study. If this keeps up, the arch structure of the crust will crumble down catastrophically, and in chain reaction too. And it doesn't take "much" edge weakening to fail an arch. 

biologically produced ones like coal and other petrochemicals. Marble, limestone, Diatomaceous earth, and other such minerals are candidates as well. Manganese oxides may be a good candidate the biologically formed ones have several unique industrial applications due to having an unusual microstructure. It is also most easily mined from seafloor sediment. 

the great oxygenation event was caused by the evolution of photosynthesis, photosynthesis turns CO2 and water in to sugar and oxygen. so the oxygen came from CO2 and water. keep in mind CO2 levels were many many times higher (~20X) than today. Hydrogen was not released it was combined with carbon and oxygen to make sugars 

the trick is not all isolated rocks are produced the same ways. Of the two in your pictures the first is an old volcanic events; intrusions, dikes, ect. depending on which rock in the region you are talking about. The whole deccan plateau region is full of them, some have been exposed on the surface via erosion. Basically everything else eroded faster than they did leaving them sticking out. 

looks like tar, It could come from any number of sources. oil spills, roads, old piers, ect. The light weight just helps confirms it. Depending on what is mixed into the tar getting a correct hardness may be tricky. 

Most likely a crinoid stem, there should be a central dot on each end caused by matrix filling in the central cavity. 

Additional information: The Amos study says that California lost 160 KM^3 of groundwater in the past 150 years. Now, add the amount of oil extracted. Then, add the amount of oil, water, minerals that are extracted along the West Coast of North and South America, Australia, Japan, South East Asian Islands. This should give some idea of how big are the holes human dug underground. 

The scenario may correspond with the Pacific plates. There are numerous oil, and water extracting operations all around the Pacific. After decades of intensive and continuous resource extractions, it may be showing terminal signs of the natural healing process failing to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. First, there are quite a few very strong earthquakes concentrated in the last ten years ($URL$ This alone may be trivial since the Pacific Ring of Fire is well known to churn out earthquakes. However, combined with the recent persistent droughts of Australia, Chile, US (especially California), and this year, Canada, the situation may be really concerning. Droughts alone can be caused by weather patterns. Climate change can cause it too, but it is a global factor, as opposed to more localized factor such as weather patterns. However, I think that underground processes can also cause drought. Aquifers can store a lot of heat, so the lack of underground water means that the geothermal energy will dissipate into the surrounding soil, basically slowly baking it. Less water also means that the soil is more prone to compression. Compression, especially continuous, even if it's slow, also generates heat. Oil reservoirs are also similar, but since oil is more reactive to heat by transforming into gas, and continuously extracted by humans, their pore pressure varies more. The presence of oil reservoirs around the fault lines may serve as springs. By extracting oil/gas, humans lessen the expansion force of those liquid and gas and reduce the pore pressure, which stabilizes the fault line. But in the long term, as is the case now, the reality is that there will be not enough oil to provide adequate pore pressure/lateral stress/counter-compression force. This may be the cause of the recent frequent strong earthquakes; the plates are loosening. Eventually, all the edges of the Pacific ring will all fail in an epic catastrophe, as the arch structure of the crust crumbles. Also, by removing oil, it liberates more space for gas to form. Gas is more compressible and heated by compression; it is another source geothermal heat. It is like a bike air pump/air suspension system. The idea is that the excess of geothermal energy causes surface water to dry out faster. Another possibility is that the fault line of the West American continent is already caving in and is dipping deeper/entering into more contact with the mantle. The mantle is a way stronger source of heat, and without adequate of underground heat absorbers, the surface soil becomes baked. I think that it's also the cause of the Blob ($URL$ The heat of the soil is escaping into the ocean, forming the Blob. Combined with El Nino, it worsens the drought. 

It mostly has to do with the type of convergent boundary the Himalayas are, continental crust to continental crust. Most convergent boundaries are oceanic to continental or oceanic to oceanic. In both cases there is a dense oceanic plate that can get subducted. But in a continental crust to continental crust collision neither can really dive under the other and get reworked*, since both are low density, thick, and roughly equal in density, so they just compress together like pushing two wads of clay together. They build both up and down since they sort of float on the rock below. Think of it kinda like a geologic iceberg, it is too light to sink. All compressive collisions thicken like this to a lesser extent, due to the compressive forces, it is just far more intense with continental to continental collisions because there is no other outlet for the energy but compression because all the material involved is to light to be subducted. . the Eurasian and Indian plates are both large continental plates so as long as they are getting forced together they can only get thicker and thicker. This is the only boundary like this on earth right now, so it seems weird to us, but this type of collision has happened before they are just rarer. *sometimes one does go down more than the other but it does not get reworked, they just get fused together in a lopsided fashion.
