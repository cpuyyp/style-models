In the case of perfect competition, the firm can sell any quantity at the market price, so marginal revenue equals the price (MR = P). It will choose to sell a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC). From these two equations we have MR = MC = P. 

The monopolist will restrict output to be able to charge a higher price. It is true that if the monopolist reduced the price, it could sell more units, but the benefit of selling more units is more than offset by the fact that the monopolist would have to charge a lower price on all units that were previously sold at a higher price. Profits are maximised when marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). Producing in a region where marginal revenue is lower than marginal cost lowers profits. 

Yes, it can, but... it can't just eliminate any liability. It couldn't eliminate any deposit liabilities, for example, because it still owes money to depositors. This doesn't change just because a loan is written down. It would have to eliminate 100 from shareholder equity (a liability). Shareholders would take a loss as a result of the bank writing down the loan. The end result wouldn't be the same as how the bank started out. In the most simple case the bank started out with: Start: 100 shareholder equity (Liabilities) and 100 cash (Assets). It made the loan from cash: 100 shareholder equity (Liabilities) and 100 loan (Assets). After writing down the loan: 0 shareholder equity (Liabilities) 0 loan (Assets). The bank blew 100 in cash, which ultimately came out of the shareholders' pockets. 

Turkey had an estimated military spending of $14.8 billion in 2016. A 30% increase would be a $4.5 billion increase. That's 0.5% of GDP. Turkey's government budget deficit was 1.1% in 2016. All else equals, the budget deficit would rise to 1.6% with that kind of increase in spending. Either that or they cut spending elsewhere. 

For the monopolist, marginal revenue is lower than price (MR < P). This is the crucial point. When the monopolist sells an extra unit of output, it earns price, BUT it also loses some money as it has to lower the price on all units previously sold at a higher price. This is why the monopolists marginal revenue at every quantity on the chart below is lower than the price. This is why on the chart below the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. 

Check out sunk cost. Although this might seem completely counterintuitive, the investment you have made should be irrelevant to your decision to stay or quit, if this investment has already been made and cannot be recovered. What matters is whether the benefits you are yet to incur outweigh the costs (that you are yet to incur). So the decision should be a forward-looking one. The above reference mentions that in the real-world, people often do not behave in this way. According to sunk cost theory, this is irrational, but this is only one theory. 

Aggregate supply is typically modelled as $$ Y = F(A, K, L) $$ where $Y$ = total production $L$ = labour input $K$ = capital input $A$ = total factor productivity Investment in infrastructure can increase both capital input $K$ and total factor productivity $A$. In a standard $AS - AD$ model, the aggregate supply curve would shift to the right, as a result, and the equilibrium output of the economy would increase. 

No, banks don't directly profit from selling bonds to the central bank. These bonds are sold at face value, there is no discount or premium, this is not part of the system. My best guess of what the author means is that by selling bonds to the central bank, commercial banks get cash, which they loan out and make a profit on the loans. So commercial banks profit from selling bonds to the central bank in an indirect way. Attributing banks' profits from lending to the central bank is a bit of stretch though and not a very appropriate statement in my view, so I fear I might have misunderstood the author. What the article seems to promote is already a reality in communist China, where state-owned banks lend at favourable rates. There can be significant problems with this approach of cutting out private banks, as the Chinese bad loan problem shows (although private banks can also accumulate bad loans, but maybe less so due to competition), but this is a different discussion. 

The interest rate is (1) the price needed to take on risk and (2) the price needed to delay consumption. The reason there is a positive risk free rate, even though there is no risk, is because of the time preference typical of any economic agent. It is preferable to consume today, than to consume tomorrow. To put off consumption today and invest in the risk free asset instead, the agents want to earn interest, otherwise they will consume instead of saving. Normally, if the risk free rate was zero, nobody would buy the risk free asset, but spend everything on consumption. E.g. nobody would buy government bonds. The government has to offer a positive interest rate to find buyers. Current negative interest rates are actually a reflection of how our classical assumption, that agents prefer to consume today rather than tomorrow, has been turned on its head. Nobody wants to consume today despite zero or negative interest rates contrary to the classic theory above (and people buy government bonds with negative interest rates). This can happen if agents are apprehensive enough of the future to want to increase their precautionary savings instead of consuming. If they are worried enough, they will do this even if they lose money on their savings (due to the negative interest rate). 

From a purely economic perspective, it doesn't make sense to feel resentful when a national company is sold to foreigners. Imagine a company in my country is sold to a German investor. This shouldn't be a problem, as from the sale price my country could go to Germany and buy a German company instead. So it's all fair game. However, some countries are growing in influence relative to others. For example, China is growing in influence and economic power relative to the rest of the world. When Chinese companies buy European companies, this is a very obvious sign of that growing influence and this is one reason it raises concerns in the countries that are being targeted. It is hard to accept that one's country might be losing in relative influence. From a strategic point of view, it might make sense to try and protect national companies from foreign buyers. If the Chinese buy a German company, they might get access to new technology, which can help them develop their own industries. This can lead to increased competition for the German industry. By protecting national companies and proprietary technologies, Germany can limit competition and stay more competitive on the world stage. The above discussion covers the buying and selling of existing assets, which is usually more controversial. Foreign investment in greenfield projects (when a foreign company builds a completely new factory) is generally considered positive for the national economy as it creates jobs and generates additional tax revenue for the government. 

Yes, it is possible to peg any currency to the USD. The big question is: at what rate? To peg the Congolese franc to the USD, the central bank needs USD reserves. This is necessary to maintain the peg. (If the currency depreciates, the central bank will sell some of its USD reserves and buy the currency to prop up the exchange rate and thus uphold the peg). As per the article cited in the question, the Congolese central bank doesn't have much foreign currency reserves. Based on the chart below, it appears to me that the Congolese franc was in fact pegged to the USD until early 2016. It seems the central bank couldn't maintain the peg at that rate and had to let the franc slide. To have a strong currency, the central bank needs to limit the money supply. However, the government will often pressure it to do the opposite, i.e. pressure the central bank to print money and buy government bonds, so the government has money to spend. (The article mentions plans to slash the government budget in order to limit the supply of francs in the economy). For this reason in advanced economies central banks are typically strictly independent from government. 

The monopolist will choose to sell quantity Q* corresponding to Point A, where MR = MC < P. This quantity is lower than the quantity were price equals marginal revenue (where the D curve intersects the MC curve above), which is the quantity chosen in perfect competition. So the quantity sold by the monopolist is lower than the quantity sold in perfect competition. This is why a monopoly is undesirable from the consumer's perspective. Look at the chart above to the right of Point B. There are people (represented by the D curve) who are willing to pay a higher price for an extra unit of output than the marginal cost. Still, the monopolist will not produce that extra unit. 

I haven't followed this particular rate hike, but here is a basic explanations why the dollar might weaken after an increase in interest rates: The rate hike was widely expected and already priced in by the market, As a result, it didn't have much of an effect on the exchange rate. Keep in mind that the dollar can fluctuate quite significantly even on days without a Fed decision. The move you refer to might be one of these fluctuations and have nothing to do with the rate hike. Or a small move due to the rate hike might have been overshadowed by a bigger move due to a different factor. It's worth keeping in mind that it's not the events themselves that matter for exchange rates (or stock prices), but how these events turn out relative to expectations -- markets are forward-looking. 

A little inflation is better than zero inflation (or deflation), because wages are "sticky" - they don't usually get adjusted downward. If a company is facing a year that is a bit worse than the previous year due to small fluctuations in demand, wages should actually be decreased. Companies typically don't cut wages though, so they might even choose to let go of some of their staff. Now, if there is 2% inflation and wages remain flat in nominal terms (nobody is getting a raise), wages will be down 2% in real terms. So the company is better able to cope with the slump in demand (its real costs are lower) and it might not have to let staff go. Moderate inflation also makes it possible to have negative real interest rates. This gives central banks more flexibility to stimulate the economy. Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation If inflation is zero and the nominal interest rate is zero, the real interest rate will be zero and the central bank won't be able to make interest rates go any lower (assuming nominal interest rates can't be negative). However, if inflation is say 2%, if the central bank sets the nominal interest rate to zero, the real interest rate will be -2%, giving a significant stimulus to the economy. In general, moderate inflation also helps keep the economy going. If there is inflation and consumers or companies sit on cash, their holdings are being devalued in real terms. This gives them an incentive to spend and invest instead of hoarding cash.
