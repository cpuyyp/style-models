This lacing pattern is actually explicitly recommended by Shimano and Magura for rear disc hubs. Under braking, the leading spokes will be in tension, while under drive the trailing spokes will be in tension. The tension acts to straighten out the spokes, pushing the spokes on the other side of the flange outward from the flange centre line. I don't know if anyone has measured this effect, but I imagine it's negligible for most purposes. Nonetheless, according to Roger Musson, old-fashioned disc brake designs used to have very tight clearances between the caliper and the NDS spokes, so you would want the leading NDS spokes to be on the outside at the final cross to avoid contact with the caliper under braking. This is irrelevant to your wheel because it doesn't have disc brakes. Conversely, there's an argument that the DS spokes should be laced the opposite way around to avoid contact with the mech cage under drive load when on the biggest sprocket. This seems even more tenuous to me, given how small drive forces are in comparison with braking forces. Either way, it's consistent with what's observed on your wheel. I'm not sure how much merit any of these arguments have – would be nice to know if someone's measured it. But in any case, asymmetric lacing patterns have some favour among the big names in the industry, at least for disc brake set-ups. 

If you want a saddle that takes pressure off your sit bones (ischial tuberosities), this design is probably appropriate: 

Not sure what to call it, but a couple of my wheels are missing the grippy washer thing that sits on the lock nut. They seem to be attached to the lock nut to begin with, but they just fall off after a while and get lost when swapping wheels. Can they be replaced? If so, where can I find the replacement part? With: 

Yes, you can, although you'll need a longer chain to go with it. The important thing here is the capacity of the rear mech you're using. However, since your bike already has 50/36 11-32 gearing, changing the chainset for a 52/39 actually reduces the amount of chain slack the rear mech has to deal with (52-39 < 50-36), so there shouldn't be any problem. Just remember to adjust the position of the front mech (move it up the seat tube) to accommodate the larger chainrings. 

I'll just comment on chainrings, since the other responders have already provided good guidelines regarding rear cogsets. My ways of "measuring" chainring wear, without any tool, would be to first wrap a new chain around the suspect ring, then inspect it carefully, to see if the chain sits tight in the bottom of the gap between the teeth (good, so far), or if it appears as if it "lifts" out of the gap (not so good). A worn ring will usually have an irregular, asymmetrical appearance. You will see that the tips of each tooth look as if they are beginning to look sharp & pointy, and the ends of the teeth will have lost some of the nice, square edges where they were originally machined & finished. The worst effect of a worn-out chain is that it stretches over time with use, and so the pivot bushings are no longer correctly spaced at 1/2-inch intervals. This is what causes the eventual failure of the teeth to grip the chain. The chain will tend to "ride high" on the teeth. Perhaps the best way to see if your rings are really all that worn is to compare them visually to a new ring of the same brand. Bring your crank to a bike shop and look around. Some types of rings feature somewhat-odd tooth profiles. Do a careful comparison of your rings with some new ones and pay particular attention to the leading edge of each tooth, where it does the work of pulling the chain along. You'll almost certainly see some wear here. Another way of checking is by merely giving the ring a good cleaning. Does the black gunk built up on the teeth come off easily, or is it practically ground into the metal? Do the teeth have good, square edges, or do they seem as if they were rounded over? Is there a semblance of a flat end on each tooth, or do they look like shark's teeth? Are the teeth finger-friendly, or are they riddled with sharp burrs ? Compare the way a new chain will stay close to the rings of a new bike when you attempt to lift a section of the chain up and away from the teeth. It should only lift a tiny amount. If the chain can lift off the ring excessively, then it's no longer fully seating between the teeth during rides, and this will cause wear. This is because a stretched chain will ride near the tops of the (worn) teeth, and will chew into the leading side of each tooth. The chain's contact region is being concentrated on a too-small area of each tooth. Finally, the last one I can think of is to try moving the chain lengthwise, back-and-forth on the ring. A worn ring will allow some movement, while a new ring & chain will seem stuck together. In the end, it's a matter of cost, convenience, and whatever you deem as acceptable ride quality, and you'll have to be the one to make the decision. It may be seen as the right opportunity to replace & upgrade, or it may be the sound of the death knell, and you may move on to another bike entirely. Or, you may find that your rings still have a lot of life left in them. A lot of it depends on the worth of the bike itself. I'll assume we're asking this question because we have a bike that we love & wish to preserve. But a lesser ride may not be worth the investment in new components. The point I hope to make overall is that it's not usually an easy thing to determine, and you need to use your best judgment. These are most of the guidelines I've used in my 47 years of bike repairs. Hope this helps. 

The cycle computer will over-report your speed by a factor of , which amounts to about 2%. The speed calculated by the computer is , so if the circumference is 2% too big, then the speed will also be over-reported by 2%. Conversely, your actual speed will be about 2% smaller than what your cycle computer reports: a factor of . So if the computer says you're moving at 30 km/h, you'll actually be moving at about 29.3 km/h. The average speed will scale in exactly the same way as the instantaneous speed. In general, if your true wheel circumference is , the value you've put into the computer is , and the reported speed is , then the true speed will be . 

I noticed after mounting some new tyres that part of the side wall, just above the bead, seems to have been damaged while I was fitting them (see photos below). These tyres were especially difficult to mount, even with the bead seated in the rim's bead well all the way around. So tight, in fact, that the only way to get the bead out of the well and seated under the bead hook was to pump it up to a much higher pressure than I would ride it with and wait for it to "ping" into place. I think it's this process that ended up causing the damage you can see in the photos. The tyres in question are these (folding version). Have I compromised my tyres, or should I not worry about it? 

There may be others brands that use a similar design, but I think ISM is the best known. The idea is that most of your weight is supported on the frontal prongs, rather than the flat area at the back. They have a gap in the middle to avoid putting pressure on your perineum. For this reason they're especially popular among time triallists and triathletes because they allow you to rotate your pelvis forward more comfortably. They feel quite different to conventional saddles, mostly because of the extra width at the front, and will probably take some getting used to. The image came from this review. 

How exactly to clean it depends on the type of dirt, so try to figure that out first. If it's just regular dust, possibly mixed with moisture and some grease/oil to make it sticky, regular household cleaners should work well. Try to get something mildly (!) abrasive, such as a metal cleaner (used for cleaning stainless steel metal sinks) with a mild abrasive component. The dirt could also actually be a different paint (maybe someone tried to repaint the frame at some point?). That will be a lot more tricky. Solvents would likely remove the original paint too; here your only option is probably to gently work with sandpaper. Finally, there are special erasers for cleaning hard surfaces. They look and work similarly to pencil erasers, but are harder, to clean away stuff that is difficult to remove. They should be available at stores for household goods, or at hardware stores. 

The second point is the main risk. A foreign object on its own is usually not strong enough to completely lock the wheel, but if the fender itself gets pulled in, a complete lock-up is quite likely. This is a problem mainly with the (softer) plastic fenders, so it only became a real concern when metal fenders were phased out in favor of plastic fenders. I seem to recall reading about some nasty accidents with early plastic fenders. 

The main detail you will have to watch out for (as indicated by Kibbee) is whether the two cranks use the same bottom bracket. Crankset attachments are standardized; however, to paraphrase Tanenbaum, there are many standards to choose from :-). To check whether a specific crank and bottom bracket match, you'll need to know some details about the bottom bracket, such as shaft length, attachment type (square, most common, or spline) and chainline. There are compatibility charts online to help you; a good one is Sheldon Brown's Bottom Bracket Size Database, which also lists the Shimano Sora and Ultegra. Also, check whether the new crank is compatible with the chainrings. There are different attachment mechanisms in that area, too, so you may need to swap the chainrings along with the cranks. If you want to play it safe, it's best to buy the part at a local shop. They can tell you whether it matches or not, and, most importantly, if they tell you it definitely matches and are wrong, they'll have to take it back. Also, they'll be able to answer your questions about mounting it - or mount it for you for a fee. Finally, note that for some attachment mechanisms, you will need a special tool for removing the cranks, called an "crank puller". I think you don't need one for the Shimano Sora, as it is "self-pulling", but better check to be sure. 

For XC and trail use it'll be fine. It's really only downhill bikes that require especially strong stems, I think (and in that case you'd likely be using a shorter stem anyway for handling reasons). 

That looks like a Cervélo RS (from some time around 2008) with an aftermarket Easton EC90 fork and DT Swiss wheelset fitted. You can find a review of the bike from when it was released here. 

It really depends how deep the scratch is. If it's deep enough, then a new CSU (crown-steerer unit) is the only sure-fire fix. However, here are some steps I've taken in the past, which have given me some success: 

You've essentially just described the 100 mile time trial, which is fairly popular event in the British time trial scene (and perhaps elsewhere, too). The idea in a time trial is simply to complete the given course as quickly as possible. They're ridden on specialised TT bikes and are usually held on roads that have as few junctions as possible, so as to minimise traffic interactions. Most people manage to complete the course without ever coming to a stop. The 100 mile TT is probably the longest milestone in TT distances where it's practical to keep riding without any stops (the next one up in the British TT scene is the 12-hour TT, although the cycling part of an Ironman is 112 miles). Many competitors have helpers stationed along the way to pass up drinks as they pass. While this sort of event will take a decent amount of training (it's probably similar in effort to running a marathon), it's certainly doable! The record for this distance, set in 2015, stands at 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 54 seconds – although most people will take over 4 hours. 

Modern chains have inner and outer links. On a conventional chainring, all of the teeth are the same width, and therefore have to be narrow enough to fit into the chain's inner links. This means that there's enough space for the chain to move about a bit from side to side on the chainring, which can cause it to fall off. Historically this hasn't been much of a problem, since on geared bikes the front derailleur cage tends to stop it from falling off, and on single-speed bikes there's no chain slack or gear changing at the rear to cause chain-drop. However, when you remove the front derailleur, but keep the rear derailleur (as is becoming common with single-ring setups), dropping the chain becomes more of a problem. This can happen when changing gear on the cassette, or when a bump causes the chain to go slack momentarily. Narrow-wide chainrings have alternating narrow and wide teeth that fit into the inner and outer links respectively. This makes the chain more secure on the chainring and less likely to fall off. A narrow-wide ring is only necessary if you have a single chainring at the front and a rear derailleur. They won't work at all if you have more than one chainring at the front, since you won't be able to change gear. You don't need a special cassette, but you might benefit from using a clutched rear derailleur (particularly on a MTB), which prevents the chain from going slack on bumpy terrain. A well-established alternative to a narrow-wide ring is a chain guide, which behaves somewhat like a front derailleur in keeping the chain from falling off:
