In your example, Mary's watch is not a DP 'predicate', but the second argument of an 'identificational' verb be that expresses identity between its two arguments, not class-membership. Since 'identificational' be is a two-place predicate - not a copula linking a monadic nominal predicate to its subject - its two arguments can be initially projected, under X-bar assumptions, in its 'complement' and 'specifier' position, respectively, which means that the 'XP-internal subject hypothesis' can account for cases like this without the slightest difficulty. You should, instead, have used an example like John is an engineer, where is does express class-membership and an engineer is, indeed, a nominal one-place 'predicate', but note that, in that case, the specifier of D (= a) is empty, and, again, there is no problem whatsoever in initially projecting the eventual subject John in Spec D in case you should want to adopt that analysis. (You need not, though, because there are other, and arguably more attractive, possibilities, such as the 'predication hypothesis' that P Elliott refers to). 

Addendum 2 (March 2018) I think I better tell you the context. (What do I want to do with this list?) I am writing a fantasy story. There was a small group of aliens traveling through space, and they got lost. They had technical problems and they stranded on a planet that turned out to be our planet earth. This happened thousands of years ago, and all humans on earth are descendants form this small group, and all languages spoken on earth today derived form the language of this small group of invaders. I want to construct a language, that could be the proto-language of the first humans on earth. My second goal is to make this language as easy to be pronounced by everybody on this planet, as possible. I want that people from China find it as easy to pronounce as people from Saudi Arabia, from Russia, from the USA, from Namibia, and so on. I think that i don't need a set of common phonemes to combine, but a set of very common syllables, because even wide spread phonemes can be hard to be pronounced, when you use unusual combinations. I want to try to build an artlang that is made of common syllables, and this is why I am looking for the most frequent spoken syllables on earth. btw: When two syllables are similar, I want to count them as identical. For example the english words "I, eye, ay, aye" and the German "Ei" are all the same syllable (/aɪ/). 

The answer to your question is no. If a language had a word like whon? standing for what on?, first, that word should, if anything, be described as a 'wh-postposition', not as a 'wh-preposition', and secondly, and above all, if such a word existed in any language, its wh+Q-operator would have to 'question' just the preposition on, not its complement, and the result would not be a 'partial' wh+Q-question, as in your What did you put the toy on__?, but a polarity (= a 'yes/no') question similar in meaning to what B replies to A in the following dialogue (say, between somebody who has arrived at his shop at 8 a.m., before his shop attendant, to find all the lights on and the shop attendant supposedly in charge of closing the shop and turning them all off on leaving the day before): A: Do you know how you left the lights when you went home last night? B: On? (= Did I leave them on? = a yes/no question) The reason why presumably no human language has an interrogative word like whon? meaning what-on (< on what?, after 'P-stranding', a very rare feature of English) is that, as Katz & Postal in their (1964) book argued, a) the wh+Q- morpheme behaves as an interrogative determiner, b) what wh+Q- 'determines' is necessarily a (pro)nominal element (i.e., it cannot be a 'predicate', say a preposition - or a verb, for that matter), and c) what the wh+Q- operator correspondingly 'questions' is the identity of a) a human individual, as in who (approximately analysable as the surface form of *wh+he), or b) a non-human individual or substance, as in what (approximately the surface form of *wh+it), or c) a time interval, as in when (the surface form of *wh+en), or d) a place, as in where (< wh+ere), or e) a way of doing things - as in how (roughly, < *wh+(s)o)), or,finally, f) a reason for doing things, as in why (< wh+y), basically. In sum: what can carry an interrogative wh+Q- determiner is, at bottom, an NP/DP or an equivalent pro-form (which may happen to be a 'bound morpheme') denoting an 'entity' (an 'object' in Frege's sense), and, since a preposition does not denote an 'object', it cannot carry a wh+Q operator. (In this, I fully agree with Eleshar's answer above). Note that the (informal) Logical Forms of Who wrote Hamlet?, When was Shakespeare born? Where was Shakespeare born?, etc. are, respectively, Which x, x = a human being, Wrote (x, Hamlet), Which x, x = an interval of time, Was Born (Shakespeare, at/in x), and Which x, x = a place, Was Born (Shakespeare, in x)]. That classical analysis of interrogative wh-items has never really been challenged because several of the abstract bound morphemes on which it depends, particularly -en, -ere, -ow, and the -y of why, do occur elsewhere: in the corresponding th- 'deictics' then, there, thus (< *th + so < Middle English swa), and in the Early Middle English instrumental thy - roughly meaning 'for this' (note the contrast wh + y <> th + y). Hence, I am sorry to have to say that neither German wo+von, wor+auf, wo+mit, etc., nor English where+to, where+abouts, etc. (nor their Dutch counterparts) are, in fact, examples of what the OP is interested in. To start with, because all of them would be post-positional, not prepositional expressions, but above all, because in none of such cases is the preposition itself 'questioned' by the wh+Q- operator. Spanish por qué, French pourquoi, Italian per che, etc. would at least be 'prepositional', but again, even in those cases, what the wh+Q- operator 'operates' on and 'questions' is not the preposition, but its '(pro)nominal' complement, whereas in the OP's hypothetical wh+on example the preposition has no complement and the wh+Q-operator would have to operate on the preposition itself (= a two-place 'predicate'), which, as far as I can tell, is impossible on conceptual grounds. That does not mean that it is impossible for a predicate, in general, to be the apparent focus of a question, of course. In a yes/no question like Did he marry her? the VP marry her certainly counts, informationally speaking, as the focus of the question, but what the Q-operator really 'binds' (informally: 'questions, focuses on') in that clause is not the VP itself, but the polarity variable - ranging over the two t-type values {'true', 'false'} - associated with all clauses. Hence, the meaning of that question can be paraphrased as 'Is it true (or false) that he married her?', and, even more tellingly perhaps, the natural 'tag' that can be added to it is didn't he (or just not), as in Did he marry her or not/didn't he?, which clearly points to the clause's polarity value as the real focus of the Q-operator. Interestingly, in Old English, presuppositionally 'marked' yes/no questions could still be introduced by the wh+Q-word hw+aether (a direct ancestor of our present-day whether) that could be transparently analyzed as the wh+Q- operator (spelt hw- at the time) plus a determiner, either, that introduced a proposition with the canonical structure of a positive statement (as in E. Closs Traugott's example [HES, p. 73] Hwaether ge nu secan gold on treowum? = 'Is it (really) true, or false (as I believe), that you now seek gold in trees?'), which made the logical structure of all OE questions, both polarity-focused and non-polarity-focused, look more uniform than it seems in Modern English (although, of course, we still have whether, possibly followed by or not, introducing 'indirect' polarity questions with the syntactic SVX form of statements (= propositions). The only case in which a predicate can be the real focus of a Q operator, then, is in 'alternative questions' like Did he marry her or leave her?, but note that those are neither 'partial' nor 'polarity questions': they resolve, though, into two coordinated (contraposed) polarity questions, i.e., Did he marry her or did he leave her?, in each of which a separate Q-operator 'binds' the polarity variable (not the VP!) of the respective coordinate clause. 

I'm not interested in the 4th column. English: $URL$ This list has only 3 columns, where #1 and #2 are identical with the first two columns of the German list. Columns #3 is the same as the German col#3, but in the German list you have counts per million, in the english you have percent, which is just another representation of the same thing. How would I use those lists to create an all-language-list? In the english list I would convert the numbers in column 3 into counts per million like in the German list. Then I need the number of native speakers per language. Such a list can be found here: $URL$ As you see, English had 360 million native speakers in 2010, and German had 89 million native speakers in the same year. So I multiply the (converted) english numbers by 360, and multiply the numbers in columns #3 of the German list with 89, and then merge both lists. If there are syllables used in english as well as in German (like [ɪn]), I add both wighted numbers. Then I sort this list again by those numbers. The result is a list of the most frequent syllables of the German and English spoken part of the world. And because I am interested in the most frequent syllables, it is safe to ignore rare languages, among which you will find all languages, that not have been studied. And to give you an example what I am not looking for: $URL$ There you find numbers of digrams and trigrams, but this are not phonetic syllables! 

The Spanish equivalent of It seems that they hate each other is Parece que se odian. In both languages seem/parecer are one-place predicates (well, both can optionally accept a second argument with the role of an Experiencer, as in It seems to me that they hate each other/Me parece que se odian, but this is irrelevant to the present question and can be ignored here). Thus, again, in both languages, under the monadic reading of seem/parecer, the only real argument is discharged by the clause introduced by that and que, respectively, which appears post-verbally and, in English at least, clearly occupies the 'complement of V' position. Whether that is also the case in Spanish is less obvious, and will be the focus of this question, but allow me first to briefly complete the scenario in which doubt may arise in this respect. In both languages, therefore, the subject position is non-thematic (no argument = no theta role), but a difference arises at this point: English being a non-pro-drop language (= the Extended Projection Principle of Chomsky's early GB/P&P Theory), in English the subject slot must be occupied by a pronounceable 'dummy' (it, in this case), whereas, Spanish being a pro-drop language, no 'dummy' is required - nor possible, under Economy - (cf. *Ello parece que se odian) and so Spanish clauses of this type apparently have nothing in subject position. Also, in both languages, raising the post-verbal that/que clause into subject position cf. That they hate each other seems and Que se odian parece, respectively, leads to ungrammaticality. The reason, however, has nothing to do with the raising of the clause itself, which is allowed when the predicate is 'heavier', as in That they hate each other seems evident/Que se odian parece evidente; what blocks the promotion of the clause to subject position in such circumstances is the 'lightness' of the predicates seem and parecer, i.e., that constraint is a matter of not leaving an informationally 'light predicate' like seems or parece in the VP Focus (= default end-focus) position, which, by definition, must add informationally 'substantial' content. Having said this, I think, my readers will be ready for the issue that interests me and the question(s) that I want to raise. The fact is that whereas, in English, as stated, the clause undoubtedly sits in the complement of V position, in Spanish, where focused subjects are regularly post-verbal (cf. Ha telefoneado tu marido = lit. Has phoned your husband) the que-clause might arguably be either a complement or a post-poned subject, and, therefore, evidence is needed to determine which of those hypotheses is right. Now, in English, a standard test for the complements/attributes of verbs like seem is that they can be replaced by so. Hence, in a dialogue between A and B, A might remark It seems that they hate each other and B might, in case s/he agreed, say (Yes,) So it seems, or, in case B did not agree, s/he might reply It seems so, and perhaps add but [I know that] they do not [really hate each other]. In any case, however, what is left in situ/raised into the Focus position at the front of the clause is not the subject, which remains it in both cases, but the pro-form so standing for the that clause in complement of V position. In the case of Spanish, the standard pro-form for definite direct objects of transitive verbs is one of the paradigm le/la/lo, and, clauses being neuter gender, it would be lo, and the standard pro-form for attributes of stative verbs like ser or parecer (this case) is also lo. Spanish, unlike English, completely neutralises the D.O./Attribute opposition (in this respect). Hence, if we wanted to translate the English dialogue between A and B above into Spanish, one of the possibilities would contain the exchanges A: Parece que se odian. B: Sí, lo parece, and, in that case, the Spanish que-clause would reasonably be analysable as the complement/attribute of parece. However, that rendition of the English A<>B dialogue is not the only possibility; B might also reply Eso parece, where eso could just as easily be understood as a pro-form for an (in this case post-poned) subject, rather than an in-situ complement/attribute of parece. Furthermore, at least according to my (and my wife's) native speaker intuitions, that choice is not a free one: the 'unmarked' choice is eso, and lo is only an additional 'marked' option. In other words, Lo parece would be the Spanish equivalent of English It seems so (but...), and compatible with B's addition of something like pero yo sé que, en realidad, no se odian (= ..., but I know that they don´t really hate each other), whereas Eso parece would be the Spanish equivalent of So it seems, and (in my and my wife's Spanish), incompatible (or not easily compatible) with any addition of B's like , pero yo sé que no [se odian/es así]. This leads me to the conclusion that, in the unmarked case, the Spanish que-clause that follows parece is actually a post-poned subject, not a complement of V in situ, although there is a marked construction that allows it to stay put in the complement of V slot (and, in that case, be replaceable by the pro-form lo characteristic of all Spanish neuter and definite direct objects and attributes). Unfortunately, under the traditional view that such that/que clauses are initially generated as complements of seem/parecer, that analysis leads to a serious theoretical problem, because the would-be unmarked construction (i.e., that in which the que clause is raised from its complement of V position and postponed, with or without an intermediate 'stay' at the pre-verbal subject position) actually requires more computation than the would-be marked one (i.e., that in which the que-clause stays put after parece and no further computation is needed). This unexpected result puzzles me, and I would like to know, first a) whether other native speakers of English and Spanish share the intuitions described above (because, if no other native speakers do, the theoretical problem changes, it becomes 'How can my Economy-driven Language Faculty have allowed me to develop such an uneconomical construction?'), and then b) whether there is any way to avoid my conclusion that Spanish que-clauses following parece (but not parallel English that-clauses following seem!) are postponed subjects in the unmarked case and complements only in the marked one, and thereby to remove the Economy problem just described. 

I am looking for a list of the most frequent syllables of all languages spoken on earth, sorted by frequency. I found such lists for english and for german, but I want to get a list across all languages. Suppose you can count every syllable that is spoken on earth within 24 hours. Syllables from languages with many speakers like Chinese (Mandarin), English or Hindi are more often used then syllables from rare languages like Esperanto or Klingon and so are ranked higher in the list. And within one language there are syllables that are more often used then others. I know, what I want will be hard to realize. So I also would be happy with separate lists of the languages with many speakers, lets say with the top-200 syllables. (I'm not interested in rare syllables, my focus is on common syllables. For the same reason I'm not interested in rare languages.) And I really want spoken syllables, not written di- and tri-graphs ("" is a trigraph, not a syllable. It can be the written representation of the syllable but also part of ) 

I suspect that the internal VP structure that Carnie presents in (28) corresponds to an early 1990's analysis of the 'event structure' of active VPs according to which such verbs contain an abstract ('do-like') 'active' component which is absent in the case of verbs describing non-agentive events (e.g., 'processes' like rain, bare 'change of state' verbs like die, or non-active 'accomplishment' verbs like reach in reach the summit, etc.). The basic idea is that the Agent of active verbs like eat is projected as a specifier of that [ACT] V head (i.e., under VP1) - instead of as a specifier of eat itself (under VP2) - or, more intuitively, that eat is the surface manifestation of a complex predicate meaning 'do eat' or 'perform an eating act'. Although that analysis immediately raises difficult theoretical questions like what, then, if anything, occupies the specifier of eat under VP2, or, if he is indeed first projected as the Spec of eat under VP2, what kind of thematic role it receives from eat and how can it subsequently raise into the specifier of the 'do-like' V under VP1 and receive a second? theta role (i.e., that of Agent) there, and why is that compatible with the Theta Criterion, etc., the fact is that there is some empirical evidence in support of that analysis. Pairs like * What you didn't was educate your son properly vs. What you did´t do was educate your son properly show that there is a do verb 'hidden' under active verbs that is different from the 'dummy' do auxiliary and shows up only in such contexts. The fact that non-agentive verbs like die, see, etc. cannot be used in that construction (cf. * What he didn´t do was die/see the accident) suggests that they do not 'contain' such a hidden 'active' do verb and therefore lends support to abstract analyses like Carnie's (initially due to Hale & Keyser, if I remember correctly, but very popular in the late 1990's; see e.g. Malka Rappaport Hovav & Beth Levin's influential 1998 paper 'Building Verb Meanings'). 

I there a resource that lists the phonemes that are used in different languages? I would prefer a ranking of the most common phonemes within each language like in this example: German: 1 /ɛ/ 2 /ə/ ... 15 /x/ If no explicit ranking is available, grouping ("very common", "common", "rare") within each language would help to. The more speaker a language has the more important is this ranking for me. My goal is to identify phonemes that appear in many words of many languages and phonemes that are rarely used across all spoken languages of the world (weighted by number of speakers). I want to find a set of phoneme of which one could construct a language who's words are easy to pronounce for as many people on earth as possible. 

This list is sorted by the 3rd column, and this is exactly what I want. This column answers this question: 

As is well known, the verbs need, require, lack and want, on the one hand, and deserve, justify, merit, warrant..., on the other, can exceptionally take -ING complement clauses with ‘concealed’ passive interpretations whenever the verb of the –ING clause allows passivisation. Such ‘concealed passive’ gerunds (Huddleston & Pullum's terminology) can, in fact, even be followed by agentive by-phrases and/or adverbs, as in Your hair needs cutting by a professional, or This draft needs checking carefully by the editor, all of which seems coherent enough with the claim that they are, indeed, a) passive in meaning (although ‘active’ in form) and b) real verbs (rather than de-verbal ING-nouns), as the presence of carefully in the latter example shows. Although such subordinate gerunds must allow passivisation and, therefore, be at least two-place, it is clear that they need not be ‘transitive’ in the strict sense of taking direct objects, because dyadic verbs taking prepositional, instead of direct object complements (e.g., look at x), can also receive passive interpretations after need, etc. (cf.The ignition needs looking at). The appropriate descriptive generalisation, then, seems to be that gerunds of ‘active’ (= non-stative) two-place verbs can receive passive interpretations when they complement verbs like need or deserve. What is rather less clear is whether (and, if so, why) such gerunds must be two-place predicates, as, obviously, many 'active' verbs that allow passivisation are not dyadic, but polyadic (e.g., 'ditransitive'), and others are ‘complex transitive’, but still take bona fide direct objects. Verbs like appoint, call, compare, distinguish, give, make, offer, persuade, send, to name but a few, are either ‘complex transitive’ (cf. appoint x + Predicative, make x + Predicative, make x + do y) or straightforward three-place predicates (cf. x compares y to z, x distinguishes y from z, x gives z y/x gives y to z, x offers z y/x offers y to z, x persuades y to do z, x sends y to z/x sends z y, etc.) I therefore recently asked in a very large English language forum whether the 'passive gerund' construction was possible with polyadic/multi-predicate gerunds like appointing, comparing, giving, making, offering, persuading, sending, etc. in cases like (1-10) or not and the unanimous answer of all the British and American speakers who replied was 'no', with the possible exception of example (7), which some - to their surprise - found more acceptable than the rest: (1) John deserves appointing __ Professor (=to be/being appointed ...) (2) Fauré deserves comparing __ to Prokofiev (= to be/being compared...) (3) This present deserves giving __ to somebody you really like (= to be/being given...) (4) Bill deserves giving __ this present (= to be/being given ...) (5) The children need making __ work harder (= to be/being made to ...) (6) Tom deserves offering __ tenure (= to be/being offered...) (7) I need persuading __ to marry again (= to be/being persuaded...) (8) I need persuading __ of the truth of such a claim (...to be/being persuaded...) (9) She deserves sending __ an invitation (= to be/being sent...) (10) She deserves sending __ to prison (= to be/being sent...) [Of course, the reason why some speakers found example (7) more acceptable than the others probably is that, in (7), the clause to marry again need not be interpreted as the third argument of persuade; it can also be understood as an adjunct of 'purpose', and, if so, persuade remains a dyadic predicate.] In sum, my guess is that dyadic active gerunds can be constructed as passive complements of need, deserve, etc., but higher-adicity ones cannot. My question to this community, then, is why? Can anybody here point me to a principled explanation of this restriction? Thank you in advance.
