Is there a difference between putting Directory tags inside or outside VirtualHosts? I found a configuration file that has several VirtualHosts all with the same Directory tag inside, and the same outside; so I'm thinking of getting rid of this duplication but I don't totally understand the semantics involved. 

What's the proper way to define optional attributes in a define in puppet? Right now I'm doing this: 

Is there a more proper way to define optional attributes? Something more akin to nil or null instead of "none"? 

Is there a way to automatically synchronize all zones between BIND (9) servers so that I don't have to add zones to the slave when I add them to the master? 

These lines actually worked, I was just testing them wrong. These lines correctly try to cache only timestamped resources (those with ?id at the end) and I was looking at non-timestamped ones. 

and it did create /var/lib/bacula/bacula.sql, but when I run the job it gets deleted. Any ideas what's going on? The whole output looks like this: 

Using Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04, how can I prevent an upstart service from starting until a couple of network volumes (GlusterFS) get successfully mounted? 

I know this used to be a bug in GlusterFS 3.2 for Ubuntu, but I understand it was solved in the PPA packages for GlusterFS 3.4 as shown here: $URL$ I also remember this working in an experiment I run with some virtual machines (but since it just working, I didn't look too deep into it). I see that the gluster-client packages provides an upstart job called mounting-glusterfs.conf which contains: 

but when cron runs, it somehow tries to connect to the public IPs of the machine, which fails, because they are not bound by postfix: 

Imagining your input is saved in a file called "test.txt", you can use "awk" with the following syntax: 

So, to create a split zip archive, you could do the following (the "" is the "recursive" switch to include subdirectories of the directory): 

So, that part basically matches everything between and the next ocurrence of . As we see, this part seems to be returning what we want... PLUS two things that we do NOT want: the "" in the first line -AND- the last line. So, we pipe this first output to another "sed" instruction that only applies to the first line, and we replace the string "" by nothing, effectively removing it: 

First of all, I knew about WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation - but I must admit I did NOT know about WMIC - WMI Command-Line :) I have found the following blog post that I think helps here: Rich's Blog - Get Process CPU Usage Using WMI $URL$ In that blog post, the author uses the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process class to get the CPU usage of a process (in several ways). For instance, if the name of the running process is "iexplore" (Internet Explorer) then you would run: 

(note that the commit switch to sign off is lowercase "-s" and NOT uppercase "-S", as you typed in your question). After having done this, you can start doing your commits using your newly created "c" alias. Here's an example of creating and commiting a file called "test.txt" that will be signed off by the committer: 

To sign automatically all future git commits, you can define a global alias. For example, to create a global alias called "c", you would do this: 

How can it be 11G? What's going on? Just rounding up? but then why does it fail to fit on the other machine? 

Are there any guides, howtos, books, etc about installing and maintaining a publicly-accessible Windows Server 2008 (with IIS and SQL server) for programmers (that want to deploy their own apps)? 

How do you install SQL Server in a remote server where you don't have the option to put a CD or DVD on the machine (or have anybody do it for you)? That is, having the ISO image. I can think of installing a CD emulator, but most of the look like nasty software I wouldn't want on a server. 

How do I set all volumes into Append mode in a Bacula server so it starts backing up from scratch? I have 70 volumes which are file volumes and due to a mistake it backed up too much and run out of space. I want to have everything reset to initial, like if the volumes were just created, so I could run a full backup and take it from there. I'd like to start backing them up in alphabetical order so I know that Volume-02 comes after Volume-01 chronologically. Any ideas how to do that? 

In that case I ended up nuking the database and rebuilding it, without changing anything in the configuration and it worked. I'm not sure what happened. Since then I've had the same issue several times and it was solved by restarting directors and storages. 

when I try to change the permission of the directory that contains that directory, recursively, I get an error about the previous directory not being found: 

In a rack-mounted HP ProLiant DL380 G5 server, running Linux (RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - version 5.9, 64-bit): after a shutdown and power on, one of 4 hard disks of a Logical Drive using "RAID 1+0" started "Rebuilding". I was able to check the status using hpacucli ("HP Array Configuration Utility CLI") After a few hours, the rebuild was completed successfully (the previously defective hard drive was "physicaldrive 2I:1:2"): 

Here's a basic explanation of this awk command: : defines "|" (pipe symbol) as the field separator : only matches lines that start with "VAR_3" : prints the second field / column (that, in this case, contains the value that you want to print) UPDATE (Dec 3, 2015): So, the OP has added a clarifying comment, which leads to conclude that he wants the search to be multiline, considering the lines between two "tokens" as part of the value of the first token. Here's a revised version for the initial example, this time using the "sed" (2 times!) and "head" commands: 

The IBM website has several articles about installing Linux in the "IBM System x3850 M2" model, specifically about installing RHEL 5 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5), RHEL 6, SLES 10 SP2 (Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 2) and SLES 11. So, I guess that those Linux distributions, at least, are (or were) supported by IBM for that particular model. The articles are the following: IBM Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (Type 7233, 7234) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP 2 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7233) and System x3950 M2 (7233) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Regarding the keybind combinations to start the installation, it seems you may find them in the section 4 of the articles above. Let me quote here the "4.0 Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6" section from $URL$ 

As you can see it not only enables OpenSSH, but also opens up the firewall for it. The problem is when OpenSSH is used in a server that doesn't have a firewall. There I get: 

Since I needed this only for development, I ended up using smtp4dev, which is exactly what you need when developing an application that sends emails. The project description: 

Is it possible to install the SMTP server that you can install in Windows Server 2008 in Windows 7? Or something similar? I'm developing an application that will make use of it and I want to be able to test it and try it locally. 

Is there a way to require a resource so that it's executed first, but if it's not present, just drop the current resource all together? 

I want that when people access my web server with the ip address, like $URL$ be redirected to the domain name, like $URL$ I'm using Apache Web Server and I've tried: 

I've configured some sites on IIS pointing to E:\WebApps and subfolders. In basic settings when I click the Test Settings... button (connection as the application user) I get the error: 

but it seems there's some issue because Puppet keeps trying to install Mongrel in every run. I get tons of these from Puppet: 

I have around between 3 and 8 upstart jobs in various Ubuntu boxes that I wish to easily start, stop or restart all together. It seems that upstart would make it easy to do that, but I'm not sure how. Should I use dependencies to make a single dummy job that depends on all the others? One of my requirements is that I wish to still be able to stop some without them restarting because others are started. How should I go about doing this? 

You can use the "split archive" functionality of "zip" itself using the "--split-size" option. From "zip" manpage (""): 

Maybe you can do the following: have one open "Command Prompt" window where you run the "ftp command" and have another "Command Prompt" window where you run the query. I hope this helps. 

Great. So this seems to be working in several cases (although I guess there may be more efficient solutions). So, how does this work? Here's the basic rundown for the "VAR_3" example... The first part - - returns the following output: 

My question is the following: is there a way to see the RAID events history / log of the RAID internal controller (a "Smart Array P400")? I would like to be able to use "hpacucli" for that, but I can't find any related command in the Hpacucli Utility for Linux - All Commands Guide I may try to use other tools for this, if required (but not HP iLO - "Integrated Lights-Out" because I don't have that access), preferably avoiding any reboot. I have checked "/var/log/messages" but I haven't found any seemingly related entries there. 

I'm not really a user of Acronis Backup 12, but the following quote from Vasily Semyonov (Acronis Virtualization Program Manager) in the Acronis Forum seems to confirm that product version doesn't have a "classic" traditional GUI anymore, but only a web interface / web console (the bold emphasis is mine): $URL$ 

Good. So it also works for single line cases! Does it work well if the string searched is NOT in the input? Let's try it for (that does NOT exist in the given example):
