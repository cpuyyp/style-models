As pointed out in other answers, only length metrics can be Riemannian and there are plenty of non-length metrics satisfying your condition. If your metric is a length metric, then yes, it is Riemannian. Indeed, for every $x\in M$ the function $f_x=d(x,\cdot)^2$ is smooth near $x$. Since it attains its minimum at $x$, its derivative at $x$ is zero. Therefore its second derivative at $x$ is well-defined as a quadratic form on $T_xM$. Define the metric tensor at $x$ as one half of this second derivative. Now from the Taylor expansion it is easy to see that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is a neighborhood of $x$ where the original distance and the new Riemannian distance are Lipschitz equivalent with Lipschitz constant $1+\varepsilon$. Since both metrics are length metrics, this property implies that they are $(1+\varepsilon)$-Lipschitz equivalent globally. Since $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary, this means that they are equal. 

The conjecture as you state it is false. The variational argument (that can be interpreted in terms of fluid pressure if you like) shows that the surface has constant mean curvature and is orthogonal to the boundary. In dimension 2, this means that it is a circular arc, but in higher dimensions there are many more examples of constant mean curvature surfaces. A small perturbation of the standard ball can produce a convex body such that no sphere is orthogonal to its boundary. For such a body, the surface in question just cannot be a spherical cap. 

No. There is a length metric counter-example in dimension 3. See Theorem 1 in this paper. Let me briefly explain the construction here. For a large $n$, consider a unit segment $[p_nq_n]\subset \mathbb R^3$ and let $U_n$ be its neighborhood of radius $2/n$. Inside $U_n$, consider a "chain" formed by $n$ small solid tori. Each solid torus is a $(1/10n)$-neighborhood of a circle of radius $1/n$, and each of these circles is linked to the next one. The first link in the chain is nearby $p_n$ and the last one is nearby $q_n$. In each of these solid tori introduce a conformal Riemannian metric as follows. At the middle circle, the conformal factor is very small, so that the length of this circle equals $1/n^2$. And the conformal factor equals 100 almost everywhere between the middle circle and the boundary of the torus. So despite the fact that the middle circle is very short, the distances between points outside the torus are no shorter than the Euclidean distances. It follows that the distance between $p_n$ and $q_n$ in the resulting Riemannian metric is at least 1. Repeat this constriction for $n=10,100,1000,\dots$, choosing the segments $[p_nq_n]$ so that they converge to some $[pq]$ (but the neighborhoods $U_n$ are disjoint). This yields a length metric on $\mathbb R^3$ which defines the standard topology (i.e., the identity is a homeomorphism). Restrict it to a compact ball containing all the segments of the construction. There is no Lipschitz homeomorphism from this ball with this metric to $\mathbb R^3$. Indeed, suppose that $f$ is a 1-Lipschitz homeomorphism. Consider the image of the neighborhood of $[p_nq_n]$. The images of the chained circles have lengths (and hence diameters) at most $1/n^2$, Since they are linked, each next circle is within distance $1/n^2$ from the previous one. So the endpoints of the chain are mapped to points at distance at most $2/n$ or so from each other: $|f(p_n)-f(q_n)|\le 2/n$. It follows that $f(p)=f(q)$, a contradiction. 

No. Consider solid angles in $\mathbb R^2$. They all (except the half-plane) are isomorphic, yet one may be strictly included in another. Furthermore, a generic cone in $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 3$, has a trivial automorphism group, so you may have $Aut(C)=Aut(D)$ in the strongest possible sense but $C\ne D$. 

No. Consider a rotation-symmetric metric on $\mathbb R^2$ resembling a small spherical cap extented by a flat cone. A sufficiently short geodesic segment at the origin is totally convex in your sense. But a small neighborhood of such a segment is not convex due to positive curvature. 

The uniform distribution on the circle is optimal. Every probability measure on the disc can be approximated by the sum of atomic measures with equal wieghts, that is, by measures of the form $\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n \delta_{p_i}$ where $p_1,\dots,p_n$ are points in the disc. For such a measure, the average distance equals $\frac1{n^2}\sum_{i,j} |p_i-p_j|$. It suffices to show that for every $n$ and every collection of points $p_i$, this quantity is no greater than the average distance w.r.t. the uniform distribution on the circle. Let us show that, for every fixed $n$, the maximum of the sum of pairwise distances $\sum_{i,j} |p_i-p_j|$ is attained when $p_i$'s are vertices of a regular $n$-gon insribed in the boundary circle. This implies the desired inequality. First of all, the maximum exists by compactness. Then, since the distance is a convex function, the maximum is attained when all points are on the boundary. Now re-enumerate the points according to the cyclic order on the circle and split the sum into $\sum_i |p_i-p_{i+1}|$ (the sides), $\sum_i |p_i-p_{i+2}|$, etc. For each fixed $k$, the sum $\sum_i |p_i-p_{i+k}|$ is maximized by a regular $n$-gon. Indeed, we have $p_i-p_{i+k}=2\sin(\alpha_i/2)$ where $\alpha_i$ is the angular measure of the arc between $p_i$ and $p_{i+k}$. So our sum equals $2\sum_i\sin(\alpha_i/2)$ where $0\le\alpha_i\le 2\pi$ and $\sum_i\alpha_i=2\pi k$. Since the function $t\mapsto\sin(t/2)$ is concave on $[0,2\pi]$, by Jensen's inequality the maximum is attained when all $\alpha_i$'s are equal, q.e.d. 

Concerning the non-complete case, there is no hope for a classification. Any local diffeomorphism $f:M\to\mathbb R^n$ (non-injective and so on) induces a flat metric on $M$, this gives a lot of examples that are not subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ or anything. But there are good news: every simply connected flat manifold can be obtained this way (i.e. admits a locally isometric map to $\mathbb R^n$). There are more examples that are not simply connected. Consider any 2-dimensional polyhedral surface (e.g. the boundary of a convex 3-polytope). Remove the vertices and you get a flat Riemannian metric on a 2-manifold. 

The problem is much simpler than the general Kneser-Poulsen case. Here is an elementary proof of the fact that $B/A\le r^2$ for all $r\ge 1$. To simplify technicalities, I assume that the family of circles is finite (the general case follows as a limit). Let $p_1,\dots,p_N$ be the centers of our circles. Let $V$ denote the union of the unit circles and $U$ the union of the circles of radius $r$. Divide $U$ into Voronoi regions $U_i$ of the points $p_i$. Namely, $U_i$ is the set of points $x\in U$ such that $p_i$ is nearest to $x$ among $p_1,\dots,p_N$. (For convenience, remove the points having more than one nearest center; this is a zero measure set.) Each $U_i$ is star-shaped w.r.t. the respective point $p_i$. Indeed, if $x\in U_i$, then $|p_ix|\le r$, hence the segment $[p_ix]$ is contained in $U$. And obviously $p_i$ is the nearest center for every point of this segment. Now apply the $(1/r)$-homothety centered at $p_i$ to each set $U_i$. The resulting sets $U_i'$ are disjoint and contained in $V$, hence $$ S(V) \ge\sum S(U_i') = \frac1{r^2} S(U_i) = \frac1{r^2} S(U) $$ where $S$ denotes the area. Thus $S(U) \le r^2 S(V)$, q.e.d. The same argument works in $\mathbb R^n$ (with $r^n$ in place of $r^2$), in Alexandrov spaces of nonnegative curvature, and in Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature (just combine it with the proof of Bishop-Gromov inequality). 

Such a sequence has a limit $f$ in $C^\infty$, and this limit is a diffeomorphism satisfying $f(\mathbb Q)\subset\mathbb Q$ and $f^{-1}(\mathbb Q)\subset\mathbb Q$. The sequence $\{f_i\}$ can be constructed by induction. To construct $f_{2k-1}$ from $g:=f_{2k-2}$, consider $g(r_k)$. If it is rational, let $f_{2k-1}=g$. If not, let $I$ be an open interval containing $r_k$ and not containing any of the points $r_i$ and $g^{-1}(r_i)$ for $i\le k-1$. (Note that $r_k$ is different from these points due to the fact that $g(r_k)\notin\mathbb Q$). Then define $f_{2k-1}=g+\varepsilon\cdot h$ where $h$ is your favorite smooth function with support contained in $I$ and such that $h(r_k)\ne 0$, $\varepsilon$ is so small that the above derivative estimates hold and is chosen so that $f_{2k-1}(r_k)\in\mathbb Q$. To construct $f_{2k}$ from $f_{2k-1}$, do a similar perturbation near the pre-image of $r_k$, assuming it is not yet rational. 

You can define $A(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)=B(x_1,x_2)$ where $B$ is a solution for $n=2$. As for $B$, one can e.g. define it on the unit circle by $B(\sin t,\cos t)=\cos 3t$ and extend by homogeneity. 

A complete space without isolated points has at least continuum cardinality. At least if you agree to use (some form of) Axiom of Choice. Choose two disjoint closed balls $B_1$ and $B_2$. Inside $B_1$, choose disjoint closed balls $B_{11}$ and $B_{12}$. Inside $B_2$, choose disjoint closed balls $B_{21}$ and $B_{22}$. And so on. At $n$th step, you have $2^n$ disjoint balls indexed by binary words of length $n$, and you choose two disjoint balls of level $n+1$ inside each ball of level $n$. This is possible because the balls are not single points. Make sure that radii go to zero. Now you have continuum of sequences of nested balls each having a common point. 

No, such functions do not exist. More precisely, let $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ be an arbitrary function, $\Sigma$ is the set of $x\in\mathbb R$ such that $f'(x)$ exists and equals 0. Then $f(\Sigma)$ has measure 0. By countable subadditivity of measure, we may assume that the domain of $f$ is $[0,1]$ rather that $\mathbb R$. Fix an $\varepsilon>0$. For every $x\in\Sigma$ there exists a subinterval $I_x\ni x$ of $[0,1]$ such that $f(5I_x)$ is contained in an interval $J_x$ with $m(J_x)<\varepsilon m(I_x)$. Here $m$ denotes the Lebesgue measure and $5I_x$ the interval 5 times longer than $I_x$ with the same midpoint. Now by Vitali Covering Lemma there exists a countable collection $\{x_i\}$ such that the intervals $I_{x_i}$ are disjoint and the intervals $5I_{x_i}$ cover $\Sigma$. Since $I_{x_i}$ are disjoint, we have $\sum m(I_{x_i})\le 1$. Therefore $f(\Sigma)$ is covered by intervals $J_{x_i}$ whose total measure is no greater than $\varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary, it follows that $f(\Sigma)$ has measure 0. 

The answer is yes. Suppose the contrary and rescale the picture so that $r=1$. We may assume that $P_1$ and $P_3$ are the endpoints of the graph. There must be points on the graph that are outside the circle - otherwise the curvature at $P_2$ is at least 1. WLOG assume that there are points below the circle. The lower half of the circle is the graph of a function $f_0$ defined on an interval of length 2. Let $q$ be a point where $f_0-f$ attains its maximum, then $f'(q)=f_0'(q)$. We may assume that $f'(q)=f_0'(q)\ge 0$, otherwise reflect the picture through the $y$-axis. I claim that $f(t)<f_0(t)$ for all $t\ge q$ such that both $f(t)$ and $f_0(t)$ are defined, contrary to the fact that $P_2$ lies on the circle. To prove this, consider arc-length parametrizations $\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ and $\gamma_0(t)=(x_0(t),y_0(t))$ of the two graphs, where $\gamma(0)=(q,f(q))$ and $\gamma_0(0)=(q,f_0(q))$. Then $$ \gamma'(0)=\gamma_0'(0)=(\cos\alpha,\sin\alpha) $$ where $0\le\alpha<\pi/2$. Since the curvature of $\gamma$ is less than 1, we have $$ \angle(\gamma'(t),\gamma'(0)) < t $$ for all $t>0$. Therefore $x'(t)>\cos(\alpha+t)$ and $y'(t)<\sin(\alpha+t)$ for $0<t<\pi/2-\alpha$. And for $\gamma_0$ these inequalities turn to equalities. The integration yields that $x(t)\ge x_0(t)$ and $y(t)< y_0(t)$ for all $t\in[0,\pi/2-\alpha]$. Since $f_0$ is increasing after $q$, these inequalities imply that $\gamma(t)$ is below the half-circle (or has already left the domain where $f_0$ is defined). Since $\gamma_0(\pi/2-\alpha)$ is the rightmost point of the circle, the inequality $x(t)\ge x_0(t)$ for $t=\pi/2-\alpha$ means that the $x$-coordinate of $\gamma(\pi/2-\alpha)$ is already outside the domain of $f_0$ and one does not need to care about larger values of $t$. 

Hopefully this follows from the fact that $X$ has an open dense connected subset which is a manifold and whose complement has dimension at most $n-3$. Someone who knows something about AS cohomology is needed to clarify this. We also have $H^{n+1}(X)=0$. This and the second property above and the exact cohomology sequence for the pair $(X,X-x)$ imply that 

Let $M^n$ be a smooth manifold equipped with a nondegenerate Lagrangian $L:TM\to\mathbb R$, $L=L(x,y)$, $x\in M$, $y\in T_xM$. The stationary points of the corresponding integral functional on curves are the solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation, which in coordinates reads $$ \frac d{dt} \frac{dL}{dy_i}(x(t),\dot x(t)) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}(x(t),\dot x(t)) = 0, \qquad i=1,\dots,n . $$ Consider a smooth curve $t\mapsto x(t)$ which is not stationary. Plugging it into the l.h.s. of the equation yields coordinates of a co-vector (from $T^*_{x(t)}M$) which depends on the curve but not on the coordinate system. The invariance of this co-vector can be seen e.g. from the first variation formula for the functional. Question: Is there a coordinate-free definition of this co-vector? Actually I am interested only in the case when $L$ is the Lagrangian associated to a Finsler metric (i.e. $L$ is quadratically homogeneous). Notes 

The following 6 distances between 4 points $a,b,c,d$ can not be realized in a Euclidean space of any dimension: $d(a,b)=d(b,c)=d(a,c)=1$ and $d(a,d)=d(b,d)=d(c,d)=0.51$, although all triangle inequalities are satisfied and even strict. Adding any number of points and assigning any set of other distances to be equal to 1 does not change this fact. So no $k\ge 6$ is good if $m\ge 4$. As Will Sawin showed, $k=4$ is not good either. For $k=5$, add a point $E$ and the relation $d(A,E)=1$ to Will's example. Thus the answer to the question as stated is $k=3$ for all $n\ge 2$ and $m\ge 5$. If $m=4$ and $n\ge 2$, one can take $k=5$. If $n=1$ and $m\ge 3$, the answer is $k=2$, obviously. In the remaining cases ($n\ge 2$, $m\le 3$ and $n=1$, $m\le 2$) one can define all the $m(m-1)/2$ distances. 

There are such functions. Moreover any diffeomorphism $f_0:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ can be approximated by such $f$. For the sake of simplicity I assume that $f_0'\ge 2$ everywhere. Enumerate the rationals: $\mathbb Q=\{r_1,r_2,\dots\}$, and construct a sequence $f_0,f_1,f_2,\dots$ of self-diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb R$ satisfying the following: 

This is known as Tietze theorem: if $A$ is an open connected set such that for every boundary point there is a locally supporting hyperplane, then $A$ is convex. I don't know what is the standard reference, internet search gave me the following one: F.A.Valentine. Convex sets. McGraw-Hill, New York, 1964, pp. 51-53. There are easier proofs than fedja's (at least to geometer's eye). My favorite one is the following. Take $a,b\in A$, there is a polygonal path from $a$ to $b$ in $A$. Suppose this path has $N$ edges. Then there is a shortest polygonal path of at most $N$ edges in the closure of $A$. If it is not a straight segment, the first edge must touch the boundary of $A$ (otherwise one can shorten the path). The first point where it meets the boundary has obvious problems with local supporting hyperplane. Update. As Zsbán Ambrus pointed out in a comment, vertices on the boundary cause problems, so one should restrict to polygonal paths contained in the interior. But then it is not clear why a minimum exists. Rather that considering a minimum, one can do shorthening by hand: begin with any polygonal path in the interior, choose consecutive serments $[a,b]$ and $[b,c]$ and move $b=b(t)$ to $a$ along the segment. If a segment $[a,b(t)]$ touches the boundary at some moment $t$, observe a contradiction. If not, then the final segment $[a,c]$ is also contained in the interior, so we get a polygonal line with fewer edges. Repeat this procedure until it becomes a single segment.
