Ok, now we have all the complications. The crew will have to manually guide the ship according to external conditions and current goals. You'll need a GUI with hundreds of buttons and input fields which is no way better than a console. Besides, there's no need to use good old MS DOS, right? It can be a super powerful CLI that supports some easy-to-use scripting engine Sci-Fython and it allows the crew to write smart navigational and maintenance scripts on every day basis. The GUI can still be used but in read mode in order to display readings. It's quite convenient since most important parts can be highlighted and plot-charted. And it's better than typing "sys.fuel-monitor.getXXXparam()" anyway. 

In addition to other answers, GUI exists but no one cares Even though I'm a software engineer myself, I don't believe there will be absolutely no gui in space. It's just not practical. But... most of the time gui is a limitation. So, consider the regular interplanetary voyage. There are various aspects at work that should be taken into account by crew: 

Actually, there are examples of fantasy items that can indeed increase your intelligence. The Diadem of Ravenclaw in Harry Potter, for example, or tons of +XXX to Intellect items in various RPGs. I believe this can be explained in two ways. First of all, the enchantment on your magical staff can stimulate the brain activity and make you more concentrated and focused. Well, we have drugs that do this in the real world! So in fantasy world (with fireballs and stuff) the charm that makes you, let's say, less sleepy and more concentrated would be an amateur spell. Of course by equipping these artefacts you won't know more, but your mental capabilities will be expanded. So, in the example with fireball, you won't be able to transform it to meteor because the staff doesn't contain any knowledge about it. But you can still perform the good old fireball better because you're well concentrated and can process a dozen of magic formulas (or whatever) in your head which may be required for successful cast in your setting. The second way of explaining it is making your artefacts alive to some degree. I'm not talking about... er.... talking items, but rather 'bout something similar to the One Ring from LotR. This ring was able to change the size, make the person lose it or, on the contrary, to find it, it could even attract the wearer to itself to insanity! So magical staffs in your world might as well be that intelligent. When one equips such an item, the item somehow alters the wizard's spell-casting behaviour to make the output nicer. It guides them. Or not, in case of "bad" staff. This may also explain the "dark" artefacts. Good wizard cannot properly use dark item, because it kinda interrupts with his or her movement/casting/etc. 

Speech helps thinking There is a theory that many years ago humans developed tools because of speech, not the other way around. If we're to follow this approach then necessity of verbal communication can be easily explained. While formulating their thoughts using words, human develops the ability to think rationally. This allows us to understand abstract ideas and complicated concepts on language level. I can hardly imagine a bunch of speechless scientists trying to share their understanding of quantum physics. Though I do agree, that mind sharing with ability to speak can make wonders. Besides, there may be no way to store thoughts except literacy. What will happen to the culture without it? So, in this telepathic world people study language and use it pretty much the same way as we do it. It's natural. So I believe that mind sharing will be used more often when one needs to show something emotional, like "duuude, I got one hell of dream last night..." or "their costumes are lame, no one wore this stuff in sixteenth. Here's how they definitely looked like..." and so on. This also can be used to share some general idea, like "let me show you the main concept of string theory.... er...urgh... done! Ok, now when everyone has the general idea, let's look at the blackboard and do some maths". 

In short, there are tiny tunnels all over their body surface called tracheae. Since there are no lungs for insects, trachea work both as a "nose" and lungs. This empty tunnels go deeper into the creature's body, splitting and branching multiple times pretty much like our capillaries do (I mean, visually, not functionally :) ). For oxygen to reach the deepest dead-ends of trachea you need highest O2 concentration in the atmosphere. There is even a theory that larger insects existed about ~300 million years ago particularly because of 35% oxygen concentration at that time opposed to 21% present time. I'll agree that mountains won't do well in this case, I suggest putting them somewhere near hills so that they will be protected from winds and still be not far above the sea-level. 

Security AI won't know it has been hacked unless there are some side effects of such intrusion - data loss, weird messages, rogue processes etc. I mean, Hacking AI can bruteforce passwords or try sql injections or try sending some data via integration interfaces and so on... but unless it succeeds, there is no way for Sec AI to know for certain if it's a hacking attempt. Even if AI suspects so, why should it do anything, if all hacker's actions led to nothing? I believe hacking is not like a game where you can do mistakes. It's more like puzzle - you stare/think a lot, and then you solve it (or not). So in the end, either the hacker wins, or they don't. If it's the latter, the AI has nothing to learn from. What I see as more plausible is maybe some kind of anti-virus AI or something, that collects info about all known successful hacking attempts in the world and learns from it. 

In real world we consider orcs as a mythical creatures. We are not used to them (I mean, it's extremely unlikely for you to meet a real orc, let's say, on your way home from work). So when we look at them now, we see tusks as a distinct facial feature. On the other hand, if we were to grow up as a race along with orcs, we would've got used to them and tusks would appear as something quite natural and non-questionable. For example, we do not expect white people to change the colour of their skin to better fit in african societies or women to change their sex when working in male-driven communities. The same applies for tusks, I believe. 

So what we have is a potentially rogue AI waiting to be unleashed on non-suspecting humans. Now, how does it get the root access? Easy enough - the IT did so. Imagine that the Overseer needs additional grants, for example, for folder XXX to defragment it and make that data more organised for job YYY in there. The IT guys see the automatic request generated by the system and allow the modifications there. Next day, the Overseer wants us to allow access to ZZZ stuff. On the third day it's AAA thing. And so on. It composes requests hundreds of times every day, trolling the hell out of IT support. So eventually admin gets bored with it and writes a script to automatically allow every grants-request from the Overseer. Long story short, I believe that a job can go rogue on unix like systems only with help from humans. Also, as per my experience, some large software solutions sometimes avoid security checks and performs some parts of code in "do as system" blocks. Generally it's not tolerated and should definitely never pass code review, but hey, we're in a real world with angry customers and burning deadlines. So as another solution you can try the scenario "once upon a time junior software engineer inserts doAsSystem block in Main() function of super smart job...". 

The main limiting factor would be an oxygen concentration. Here you can read about how insects breath. 

Depends on the job. Maybe you can come up with some specific piece of software. Some kind of super-smart neural network designed specifically for computing the effectiveness of it's sub-jobs. Let's call this program "The Overseer". I wouldn't call it the best solution since almost everything from below is far-fetched to be in a good reality-based story. Still, I'm sure there are worse examples in books that brought the millions of dollars. Key points: 

I believe that sustaining an electrical current long enough to use devices continuously would be quite difficult and inefficient. This article says that only 15% of the energy obtained by eating can be used as electricity by electric eels. So perhaps the idea of powering your pc while you're gaming might not work. Still, if most people don't starve bad enough for every buzz-up, some interesting technological pieces may appear. Devices that don't need continuous charge Electrical toothbrushes, mixers, E-readers (on e-ink) and similar stuff don't usually take more than a few seconds of continuous charge. Well, the toothbrush does, but I think this tool needn't too much energy, even if it's required for some longer time. E-reader needs electricity only while switching pages. Mixers even in our world are overheating after 15-20 secs and need a break, if anyone have ever bothered reading the manual :). Interpersonal New kind of interaction between humans appear. People who know each other well enough may strike each other with friendly shock blasts. Like, you know, sometimes you just want to bite the loved one. Might as well be used in a combat, too. Disabilities People, who can't use electricity like that are considered handicapped. Various tools are created to help them fit into the world of electrocuting men and women. There are special gloves, for example, or any other tools powered by batteries that allow them to use the same devices like the rest of the world would use. 

In addition to other's answers, you can make powerful projectiles such as holy arrows or bombs to be quite uncommon. Maybe only the most advanced angels should have those because such weapons are hard to create or it takes much time (or it costs much)... etc. Make the regular weapon suck, so that most of the angel army has to land and clash with demons in melee combat. You can also come up with some kind of holy material from which weapons are to be created. The saintsteel. Or angeloferrum. Or holytanium. The demons can be killed only with this particular metal. So creating, let's say, frag grenades or arrows is ineffective since well protected demons only get injured with those at best. The only reliable way to slay them is to cut them with saintsteel swords, axes or spears. This way you can combine air forces (suppress the bad guys with grenades and rain of saintsteel arrows, maybe even cripple them badly) with ground units. And it's the latter who will get all the kills eventually. 

Again, no lethality information provided, but it's still worth mentioning, I believe. Besides, this shot was slowed down by the tree, so the original impact force would've been much greater otherwise. So, without hard science, my educated guess is that a piece of a space rock with 5-10 gramms weight can effectively kill almost any human, 100+ gm meteorite can do it even through the roof/car/etc, but that won't appear as a gun shot, I'm afraid. Edit: all assumptions are made at the moment of the considered impact. As stated in the comments, the original size of meteorites is lot bigger before they burn away. Since we're talking about a detective story, I assume we're more interested in its size upon impact. 

According to the linked article I can see that blue body parts have no hair or have very little of it. My guess is that this additional layer of collagen may somehow prevent hair follicles from appearing there. Also, our skin's outer layer is basically dead cells. Cells from deeper levels of skin are constantly reproducing to restore the outer layer. For each dividing cell its "children" go upper and... die there, creating a protective keratin protein. If there is an additional collagen layer it may affect the restoration process. I believe that this blue skin will regenerate and renew itself at lower rates, it might become quite delicate and sensitive even though it's thicker, because there will be less of keratin. 

According to this lovely page one of the smallest reported meteorites is 340-gm (12 ounces) piece of rock that penetrated roof of a house. It is still quite big, though, about a size of a tennis ball as far as my imagination goes. There is no record as to whether it was lethal or not, but if this thing is capable of going through the roof, there is no doubt that a direct hit would kill a human. This page also mentions 

They are exiles Imagine that stars, sun and moon are not celestial objects, they are exiled powerful beings. Sun was their leader who ruled YourWorldNamium with his ferocious hand, burning everyone and everything that dared to oppose him. Lune was his beloved one, but she was cold as ice and cruel to everything that lives. And there were many of those who followed them silently in their wake. But their reign didn't last long since YourPowerfulGoodGods engaged in a war with them and won it. The leaders and their countless followers were exiled far away to the cosmic emptiness, allowed only to see the world they once ruled. Later, YourGoodGods left YourWorldNamium, seeking retirement in some higher plane of existence. That left the world with Sun, Lune and the stars hanging in the sky. Exiles can only see their former land. But even now people feel the chilling wind in the freezing desert during the Lune's night; they also feel an unbearable heat that comes from enraged Sun during the day. Your tribe still carries the memories of old days and they know who are those beings above them and why these beings shouldn't be referred by their names. These are exiles.
