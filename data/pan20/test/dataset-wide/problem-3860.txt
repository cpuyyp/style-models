The Three-Squares-Theorem was proved by Gauss in his Disquisitiones, and this proof was studied carefully by various number theorists. Three years before Gauss, Legendre claimed to have given a proof in his Essais de theorie des nombres. Dickson just says that Legendre proved the result using reciprocal divisors. I am a little bit surprised that I can't seem to find a discussion of Legendre's proof anywhere. Reading the original is not exactly a pleasure since the material in Legendre's book is organized, if I dare use this word, in a somewhat suboptimal manner. So before I'll start reading Legendre's work on three squares I'd like to ask whether anyone knows a discussion of his proof (or its gaps). Edit. I have meanwhile found a thoroughly written thesis from Brazil on Legendre's work in number theory by Maria Aparecida Roseane Ramos Silvia: Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) e suas obras em teoria dos Números, which has, however, preciously little on Legendre's "proof". One gets a better idea of what Legendre was doing by reading Simerka's article Die Perioden der quadratischen Zahlformen bei negativen Determinanten, although Simerka is doing his own thing; in particular, he uses Gauss's definition of equivalence and composition of forms and describes parts of Legendre's work in Gauss's language. BTW I have only recently learned about the existence of this Czech number theorist, who discovered Carmichael numbers long before Korselt or Carmichael, and who factored (10^17-1)/9 using an algorithm based on the class group of quadratic forms discovered long after by Shanks, Schnorr, and others. 

The answer is no. Take $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[4]{-5})$. Then $Cl(K)$ is cyclic of order $4$, and its Hilbert class field is given by $H = L(i,\sqrt{1+2i})$. This field is the compositum $H = KF$ of the two dihedral extensions $K$ and $F = {\mathbb Q}(i,\sqrt{5},\sqrt{1+2i})$, hence is normal over the rationals. Edit (2015). You can construct a lot more examples along the following lines: take a number field $K$ with finite nonabelian class field tower $L/K$, and let $F$ be a subextension with $L/F$ cyclic of prime degree such that $F/K$ is not normal. A typical example: let $K$ be a cyclic cubic field with class group of type $(2,2)$ and Hilbert class field with class number $1$; then any of the three sextic subextensions is not normal over the rationals, but its Hilbert class field has Galois group $A_4$. For explicit examples see J. Théor. Nombres Bordx. 11, No.2, 387-406 (1999). 

Grunwald's Theorem on the existence of extensions satisfying local data was well known and widely used; Whaples even gave a second proof of this result before Wang found a counterexample and closed the gap. A similar mistake occurred when Shafarevich proved that solvable groups are Galois groups over the rationals - the case of 2-groups was "problematic". On a more fundamental level, Kummer's proofs of unique factorization into prime ideal numbers had gaps because he did not know about the concept of integral closure. This gap was noticed and closed only by Dedekind. 

Abelian extensions of complex quadratic number fields are generated by division points of certain elliptic functions (which I guess you can translate into the language of torsion points on elliptic curves with complex multiplication - see Pete's answer). Their rings of integers were studied in 

Functions satisfying such replicative identites are the cotangent, Bernoulli polynomials, and the logarithmic derivative of the Gamma function, to name a few. The equation for n=2 is part of the Herglotz trick (see Aigner and Ziegler, the BOOK). Replicative functions are discussed by Schroth (Aequ. Math. 20 (1980), 73-79), Jaeger (manusc. math. 56 (1986), 167-175), Walum (Pac. J. Math. 149 (1991), 383-396), Yoder (Aequat. Math. 13 (1975), 251-261). The concept of distributions in this sense was developed by Kubert (Bull. Soc. Math. France 107 (1979), 179-202) and Lang; see also Milnor (Ens. Math. 29 (1983), 281-322). Eisenstein's proof of the reciprocity law via the sine function essentially involves the replicative identity. In physics, the map on the interval $[0,1]$ defined by $x \to 2x \bmod 1$ is called the Bernoulli shift, and its associated Perron-Frobenius operator is related to replicative functions. 

The result Fermat is using here is the following: if a number $n$ is represented primitively by the quadratic form $x^2 + my^2$, where $m = 1, \pm 2, 3$, then so is any (positive) divisor of $n$ (primitively represented means $\gcd(x,y) = 1$). Fermat had descent proofs for these claims. Lagrange later showed that if a number $n$ is represented primitively by the quadratic form $x^2 + my^2$, then any prime divisor of $n$ is represented by some (reduced) form with the same discriminant $-4m$. In Fermat's examples, the class number is $1$, and the only reduced form with discriminant $-4m$ is then the principal form. Gerry's idea will also work, and it is instructive to find out where the method of parametrization for $m=5$ differs from the case $m=2$. 

I am writing an article on Fermat's work in number theory and feel uncomfortable everytime I have to write "Fermat's Little Theorem": it's clumsy and belittles the fundamental character of Fermat's result. "Fermat's Theorem" is too ambiguous, and I don't really like acronyms such as Flt or Flit. Has anyone ever seen a better name for this result (or a new suggestion)? 

Is this congruence for $(T/N)$ known? How would I start attacking this result using known results on L-functions? 

The extension K(j,E_{tors}) is abelian over the Hilbert class field of K, hence over K if K has class number 1. Silverman (Advanced topics, p. 138) says that, in general, the extension is not abelian. For getting a counterexample, looking at ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-15})$ is the right idea. Instead of factoring the quartic you might simply want to compute its Galois group, which you probably can read off the discriminant and the cubic resolvent. The field generated by $E_{tors}$ is the union of the fields generated by the $E[c]$, so for $c$ large enough you should see the nonabelian group already there. 

I am currently trying to understand Euler's article E71 on the Riccati differential equation and its connection with continued fractions. Apparently Daniel Bernoulli had shown that the equation $$ y' + ay^2 = bx^\alpha $$ can be solved by elementary functions if $\alpha = -2$ or $\alpha = - \frac{4n}{2n-1}$ for integers $n$. The proof proceeds by reduction: using a series of transformations (which you can find e.g. in Kamke's classical book on differential equations), the differential equation is transformed into $$ y' + Ay^2 = Bx^\beta $$ with $$ \beta = \frac{\alpha+4}{\alpha+3} = \frac{4(n-1)}{2(n-1)-1}. $$ Bernoulli claimed and Liouville proved that the equation cannot be solved by elementary functions for other exponents except $\alpha = -2$, the limit point for $n \to \infty$. To a number theorist, this looks a little bit like descent: every exponent $\alpha$ for which there is an elementary solution can be reached from $\alpha = 0$ by a finite series of transformations. What I would like to know is: Is this a superficial resemblance, or is there something deeper going on? In particular, can we attach some algebraic curve to this differential equation in such a way that its rational points correspond to the exponents for which the Riccati equation has an elementary solution, and can the transformations be explained geometrically? For what it's worth, in Liouville's article we can find the singular quartic $(2n+1)^2(m^2+4m) + 16n^2 + 16n=0$. Edit. I have just discovered an article on the Riccati equation from a group theoretical viewpoint which seems to confirm my suspicion that there is a lot of algebra beneath the integrability of the Riccati equation. 

I guess that the most special number field sieve (working with a quadratic or cubic number field) can definitely be explained at a very elementary level. Pollard's first example used, if I recall it correctly, the field generated by a cube root of 2. 

As Sesiano writes in his book, the first three books that once existed in Arabic translation (by Qusta ibn Luqa) are lost. But al-Karaji quoted extensively from Diophantus Book III (and gives almost all of Book IV) in his work Fahri, which proves that the Books I-III must have been known in Arabic times. The situation has not changed since the publication of the Arabic books by Rashed and Sesiano: Rashed and Houzel do not mention any new discoveries in their book Les Arithmétiques de Diophante from 2013. 

There are dozens of articles in the mathematical literature giving a rather strong correlation between the ranks of certain elliptic curves (for example $y^2 = k^3 + k$ for certain values of $k$) and the $3$-rank of the class groups of quadratic number fields (Quer, Top, DeLong), or the $2$-rank of the class groups of pure cubic fields (Frey et al, Schneiders). By Lenstra-Cohen, we certainly expect the former to be unbounded; I don't know whether Cohen-Martinet predicts that the second set is not bounded since $2$ is some kind of bad prime in this connection. I do wonder, however, whether there really are (not were!) experts who suggest that these ranks are bounded. I have also seen attempts at transferring the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics to the Tate-Shafarevich group of elliptic curves (C. Delaunay); I do not know whether these heuristics are strong enough to predict that sha is small often enough to give a large rank of the Mordell-Weil group. 

Only the second proof below is new. In 1., I explain where the units in the cubic field are coming from, and 3. is a variation of Paul Monsky's proof. 

I once used Callahan's "Spacetime geometry" as the background for a course on differential geometry. If you concentrate on what you need for deriving Newton's laws of motion from the curvature of time you can actually make it work, at least in a course for physicists. 

Weil's approach is the historical one: during the early 1930s, Hasse (with the help of a lot of people too numerous to mention) succeeded in building up class field theory using central simple algebras. Later, in the 1950s, people realized that for getting class field theory, the theory of algebras could be replaced by the formalism of cohomology: Brauer groups, for example, which had a very concrete meaning, turned into abstract cohomology groups. For Hasse, and perhaps also for Weil (?), the purely cohomological approach was "all bones, no meat" - see Hasse's comments in his history of class field theory in Cassels - Fröhlich. Personally, I'd rather read the dry cohomological version (for example in Neukirch's "Klassenkörpertheorie", which has a good chance of being translated into English soon) than Weil's book for pretty much the same reasons as you. In this book, Neukirch builds up a full grown version of cohomology for finite abelian groups (I always liked the book by Weiss - Cohomology of Groups - as a first introduction to the stuff you need for class field theory), whereas in his later book he manages to do everything with just H0 and H1 (and profinite groups). Introductions to class field theory using algebras are rare; the book Algebra II (Springer 2008; Engl transl. by S. Levy) contains an introduction to local class field theory via algebras. 

The fact that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ and its brethren have a pole at $s=1$ is responsible for the infinitude of large classes of primes (all primes, primes in arithmetic progression; primes represented by a quadratic form). We cannot hope proving the infinitude of primes $p = a^2+1$ in this way because the series $\sum 1/p$, summed over these primes, converges. This implies that the corresponding Euler product $$ \zeta_G(s)= \prod_{p = a^2+1} \frac1{1 - p^{-s}} $$ converges for $s = 1$. But if we could show that $\zeta_G(s)$ has a pole at, say, $s = \frac12$, then the desired result would follow. Now I know that there are heuristics on the number of primes of the form $p = a^2+1$ below $x$ (by Hardy and Littlewood?) Can these heuristics be explained by hypothetical properties of $\zeta_G(s)$ (or a related Dirichlet series), or can the domain of convergence of $\zeta_G(s)$ be derived from such asymptotics? BTW, here's a little known conjecture by Goldbach on these primes: let $A$ be the set of all numbers $a$ for which $a^2+1$ is prime ($A = ${1, 2, 4, 6, 10, $\ldots$}). Then every $a \in A$ ($a > 1$) can be written in the form $a = b+c$ for $b, c \in A$. I haven't seen this discussed anywhere. 

In Über die Bestimmung asymptotischer Gesetze in der Zahlentheorie, Dirichlet proved his theorem on the asymptotic behaviour of the divisor function using a Lambert series: let $d_n = d(n)$ denote the number of the divisors of $n$; then Lambert (actually this is due to Euler) observed that $$ f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty d_n z^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{1-z^n} . $$ This series converges for $|z| < 1$, and diverges for $z = 1$. Setting $z = e^{-t}$ we obtain $$ g(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{e^{-nt}}{1-e^{-nt}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{e^{nt}-1} . $$ Dirichlet writes that "expressing this series by a definite integral one easily finds" that $$ g(t) \sim \frac1t \log \frac1t + \frac{\gamma}t $$ as $t \to 0$, where $\gamma$ is Euler's constant. Dirichlet then claims that the asymptotic behaviour of $g(t)$ would imply that $d_n$ is, on the average, equal to $\log n + 2 \gamma$, which in turn implies that $b_1 + b_2 + \ldots + b_n \approx (n + \frac12) \log n + (2\gamma+1)n. $ He mentions that he has used the integral expressions for $\Gamma(k)$ and its derivative $\Gamma'(k)$ for deriving the first property. Knopp (Über Lambertsche Reihen, J. Reine Angew. Math. 142) claims that Dirichlet's proof was "heuristic". I find that hard to believe, and I am convinced that Dirichlet's sketch can be turned into a valid proof by someone who knows the tools of the trade. So here are my questions: 

In addition to Hunter Brooks' answer let me mention that C. Maire has constructed number fields with class number 1 that admit an infinite unramified extension. See also D. Brink, Remark on infinite unramified extensions of number fields with class number one, J. Number Theory 130 (2010), 304-306 for a recent modification of Maire's idea. 

In the case you're interested in the answer is yes: just replace the modulus $q$ by $q\pi^3$, where $\pi$ generates the prime ideal with norm $3$. In general number fields, the question is not meaningful as it stands because the unit group has infinite order except when $K$ is complex quadratic. 

See this short note by Brumer and the book Elementary and Analytic Theory of Algebraic Numbers by Narkiewicz, in particular Section 3.3. 

There are two different types of cubic fields: cyclic cubics and cubics with Galois group $S_3$. Cyclic cubic fields are, by Kronecker Weber, subfields of cyclotomic fields. There is no cyclic cubic field with discriminant $5^2$ since the field of $5$th roots of unity does not have a cubic subfield; the cyclic cubic field with discriminant $7^2$ is contained in ${\mathbb Q}(\zeta_7)$. Nonnormal Cubic fields can be explained by class field theory: the existence of the field with discriminant $-23$ comes from the fact that the quadratic number field with discriminant $-23$ has class number divisible by $3$. More generally, there is a cubic number field with discriminant $-4f^2$ if the order in ${\mathbb Z}[i]$ with conductor $f$ has class number divisible by $3$. All of this was worked out by Hasse (Arithmetische Theorie der kubischen Zahlkörper auf klassenkörpertheoretischer Grundlage, Math. Z. 31 (1930), 565-582). For related material in English see Daniel Mayer, Multiplicities of dihedral discriminants, Math. Comput. 58 (1992), 831--848. 

Explicit constructions of infinitely many examples seem to be difficult. Looking at a table of factorizations of $N! \pm 1$ I noticed the following pattern (and now I see that this is essentially what Dror suggested in his comment): Assume that $q \equiv 3 \bmod 4$ and $p = \frac{q+3}2$ are prime numbers. Then for $n = p-2$, we have $p \mid n!-1$ and $q \mid n!+1$ if $h(-q) \equiv 1 \bmod 4$, where $h(m)$ denotes the class number of ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{m})$. Probabilistically, the class number of $h(-p)$ should be $\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ in half the cases.
