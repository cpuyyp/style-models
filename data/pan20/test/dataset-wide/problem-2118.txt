Our typical annual review process is coming up in which we get to meet with our supervisors and discuss our performance. I am at a point in my current job where I have received nothing but positive feedback for several years however I feel like my career may be suffering since I am the opposite of your "squeaky wheel". Getting to my question, I would like to discuss salary increases and career paths with my manager however I am unsure of when the most ideal time to do this would be. I have consistently gotten yearly increases and bonuses during the review (as has most of the company to my knowledge), I am concerned that if i try to address my concerns around the same time any increases would get "bundled" and thus I would end up losing out of the full potential. A good portion of my salary (>25%) is from bonus which I have yet to been informed of. I don't want my negotiations to just come out of my potential bonus. I don't however want to annoy my supervisors with coming to them with this discussions right after this yearly process has taken place. One of the primers for this was that i was recently moved to a different role within the company (they explained that this was meant to be a positive reflection of my skills). However this new role is not as beneficial for my career outside of the company as it is what i would consider non-transferable skills that i am now learning, where previously i was learning things that would be widely used by many companies. I am concerned about investing my time in this position without the possibility of growth within the company. Two things I hope to have addressed with my discussion: 

Acquire New Employment Sometimes, especially in business, it is better to just cut your losses and move on. This is the easiest and least painful solution to both you, your career, and your family/life. You are never obligated to stay with a company forever and deal with an extremely disruptive and toxic work environment and team. Rebuild The Team If something is not working, then fix it. You are going to play office politics now, but be warned this a dangerous game and it is wise to have a backup plan or job offer. Your main gripe seems to be with the Junior member being inexperienced and playing office politics with the Team Manager. I would suggest that you get rid of the Junior first as you are the senior level developer and team lead. Document your evidence of the issues and show how you and the team have counseled him and given him training and experience on the projects/language. Discuss it with HR in private and then discuss it with your team manager in private, and then bring both together and make the motion to dismiss the employee and hire another candidate. This will fix a large part of the issue. If the manager is not improving after a new candidate is found then you should strongly consider moving on, changing teams/departments, or raising complaints to your boss's boss or senior level management. Note to upper management the serious issues facing the team and company and suggest that the manager is causing the issues. Suggest that it might be better to move on from him or have another manager run the team (BE WARNED: This CAN cost you your job. Managers usually stick with managers.) 

@user33445 Your HR department has the tools for you. When an employee is insubordinate or does not perform, there are steps that are taken. E.g, the first written warning along with clear explanation of the disciplinary process. You've already given him verbal directions which he's refused to follow. You can do it once more verbally along with description of your company's process — or you can go to the first-written-warning stage — documentation which will go into his personnel file. There need to be consequences. If the company doesn't have a system for this; then they're not giving you what you need to manage, and you should leave the position. 

Solid software engineering practices and wisdom, which she is not learning, are universally applicable. And learning those is what she signed up for — that's the benefit of the bargain that she entered into. It's the promise that this company (and the school by extension) are breaching. There are plenty of exploitative and mis-managed tech companies out there. It's the rule, rather than the exception. OP would be better off quitting this "internship", and dedicating herself to contributing to a high-profile GitHub-hosted open source project for 6 months. Because: she'll gain real universally applicable app engineering and teamwork experience. And she'll have public commits and comments to point to in job applications. 

I have been recruited by another company and requested to come in for an interview. I am considering going in for the interview however I have no intention of leaving my current job for at least 3 months due to Bonus payouts. Should I mention this fact prior to coming in for an interview or wait until they actually offer me a position. 

Define a career path that may have possibility for promotions / growth Increased salary related to performance / flexibility / value to the company 

I was recently offered a job in which I was sought out as a candidate and I hadn't originally applied for the position. At this time I was made aware of a salary I was not interested in, and in the interest of everyone's time I expressed that I made a salary of $X and would not be interested in leaving unless the salary was noticeably higher. I realize this is not how these things are typically done (first time for me). Anyhow I was asked to come in for the interview after having expressed this request and was subsequently offered a salary of exactly $X. While on the phone with HR I expressed that the salary requirements I had put on my application ($x + 20) reflected what I was hoping to get given the difference in benefits however I would be willing to negotiate for additional vacation time etc. They came back to me stating flat out they are "unable to be flexible on salary or vacation time". Does this mean my offer is a final offer and I should make my decision accordingly or should I write a formal counter offer? 

I mentioned these issues in a quick moment with one of my managers (my true manager is on vacation at the moment) and he said the company will reimburse my mileage or I can use one of the company's operation's department automobiles if I get approved by the insurance carrier and he said we will go over it tomorrow. I have 2 issues with this "solution": 

If you have access to financial records/statements then I suggest you keep that on the need to know basis. Remember your obligation lies to the owner, shareholders, and government. Employees who are not cleared to know those statements or accounts are not to be included on that information without approval from the owner or shareholders (or board of directors if applicable). I would just keep quiet and depending on your position in the company, maybe talk to a higher up financial director or CFO and see if what the owner said is true. Try to throw it into a casual conversation as a per chance kind of thing (around the water cooler): "Hey [name], I heard a rumor saying that we recorded a loss last [year/quarter/month]. How bad is it?" The response will tell you if things are going badly or what. Be careful of asking this if you are supposed to know. Try adding a small amount of humor to lighten it.
