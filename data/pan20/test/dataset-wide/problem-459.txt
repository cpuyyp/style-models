16" steerer isn't going to be found on any second hand frame except one just like yours. I think your best bet is to get a welding shop to extend a standard fork. That's basically what I did with my bikes that need long steerers, like this one: 

(edit to add) Picking Tyres My impression is that many (most?) cyclists I know go to a local bike shop and talk to people, see what's available, and buy something they can actually touch. At least once, anyway, before going "I can get these much cheaper online". Having decided on a brand or brands, and a preference for fat/slick/kevlar-studded and so on, they then grind through a few options over the next few thousand kilometres of riding before developing either very strong preferences (like the bike geeks here), or a complete lack of interest. Working in a bike shop I really did get people who brought bikes in and said "tyre. flat. replace. bye" then walked out, leaving me holding a bike going "can I at least get your phone number?" Availability is also important. If you're going to try some tyres with a view to picking one you like, pick a manufacturer that's been around for a while and doesn't change their darn tyres every year. Otherwise every time you buy a tyre you have to work out which one best matches the one you bought last year. If you're buying online, try to pick a store that keeps stuff in stock. It's annoying buying something only to wait a month while it gets shipped from a warehouse in China when you chose a "local" online store. So, my preference is for puncture resistant to very, very puncture resistant slicks, with more puncture resistance on my commuter and less on my touring bike (where rolling resistance is more important). On my velomobile I went for extreme puncture resistance because going much faster also meant that the time taken to stop and fix a puncture stood out a lot more. Spending 10 minutes fixing a puncture on a 20km ride that should have taken under 30 minutes is more annoying than I expected, so after it happened once I went for serious puncture resistance. I also prefer a brand (Schwalbe) and apart from a few older Maxxis tyres that haven't worn out yet, all... 6... bikes in our shed have Scwalbe tyres. Marathon Plus through to Marathons, with Duranos on my 700c "lazy bike" (takes less effort to go faster than by other bikes, therefore "lazy") Somewhere there's a photo of a 3" nail sticking through a marathon plus on my bike. Not, I emphasise, puncturing the marathon plus, just "zombie tyre" poking through it, with one side of the nail head ground flat where it had hit the ground every time the wheel went round. That's freakishly unusual, but it's one reason why I like the marathon plus tyres. 

That's a metal tool chest weighing about 80kg on the back of a loadbike, with my Rohloff wheel under it. The burly guy riding it found it hard to hold upright... it was heavy. 

Going fast on unlit roads you definitely want a decent light. Personally I find the combination of my 100 lumen dyno headlight plus another 100 lumens on the handlebars to be enough, but I ride relatively slowly and on a manoeuvrable bike. On a faster bike with handling and brakes designed for speed you want more. Perhaps not 2000 lumens - that's off road singletrack territory. And price. If you get a better quality 200-300 lumen light that actually puts out 200 lumens you'll be much better off than with an off-brand "500 lumens" that is actually 200... One consideration is how people coming towards you. While it's annoying to hit a small, dark-coloured lump and end up on the road, it's worse to blind an oncoming motorist and end up as a hood ornament. It's not as bad on bike paths, you're more likely just to get beaten up if you blind someone. Paying a little attention to how much light, and where you're pointing it, is important. With a high powered helmet light it's really important not to look at people's faces... when normally you should be looking there. My preference is to have a relatively low-powered helmet light for that reason - I can still look at faces, and people will see me but not be blinded unless they're already very close. Nathan's Bike Light Database is a good place to start. 

In the diagram the orange is the strap which comes in, goes under the release tab, under the blue "wrap bar" that's actually part of the one-piece fastener, then comes back over that bar and under the tab. Pressure down where the red arrow is results in friction where the red oval is. That's what holds the strap. But if there's no matching support/pressure underneath, there's not much friction and the strap slips. 

This is how I would approach your problem, simply because panniers are all smaller than even a small backpack. It wouldn't be too hard to make a shelf at the bottom of the rack (probably below axle height) that would support the bottom of the backpack. It would be easier to use a travel pack to get the cover over the straps (straps and spoked wheels are a bad combination), but you could attach a sheet of ripstop nylon to the rack to get the same effect, or just put the worst of the straps facing out like this guy did. My oversize panniers (bigger than an Ortleib rear pannier) are still only 60 litres or so, and they're ridiculously large by bicycle standards. For comparison, my ultralight backpack is also 60 litres and it's explicitly "extreme" and designed for people willing to spend their way out of size and weight problems. For real walks I use an 80+ litre pack and often strap extra stuff to the outside. 

edit in response to imel96's question in comments: explain more about gear ratio selection (sorry, can't do tables here so you're seeing a spreadsheet turned into preformatted text) When riding people care about pedal rpm, which is determined by gearing. Humans have a power/speed curve. The further from their optimum cadence they are, the less efficient they are (and in a time trial efficiency is what matters). The closer the gear ratios are, the closer to the right gear they can get so the closer to their peak efficiency point they can stay. This wee table shows what's likely to be the next 4 cogs lower than the original question on the two cassettes we're discussing. The question I'm looking at here is "going up a slight rise, what gear options are available".
