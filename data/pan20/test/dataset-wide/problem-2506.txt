Some times monastic life may not be calm as you think. Also austerity of vinaya will make it harder than lay life incase your have significant attachments. So best is: 

If this also do not work bring you attention to the upper plate (sensation and arising and passing of phenomena on this area) and place you tongue on it. (You can also try the plate and philtrum or more broadly the upper lip if this is generally the resting area when doing breath meditation.) This may cause a lot of vibrations. (If you generally place you attention in this area when doing breath meditation and arising and passing of phenomena is clear, a lot of old formation will start surfacing.) If your teeth start rattling slowly grind you teeth to stop the rattling. This intense Piti can: 

Karma is one of the things that only a Buddha completely understands. We can only have a rough idea of its operation. 

Yes this can be done if you develop abhiññā. It will be through ceto-pariya-ñāṇa. In order to do this you have to develop at least the 4th Jhana. Also there are more recent documented instances where this has been done in Venerable Ãcariya Mun Bhuridatta Thera's biography. The general training that was followed recorded in Patipadā Venerable Ãcariya Mun’s Path of Practice. (Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta Thera was a teacher of Ajahn Chah) Also refer: 

In Vanijjā Sutta it is said a lay follower should not engage in 5 types of trades which include Trading in humans (satta vaṇijjā). Some forms of slavery is still persist today. 

Skilful as skillful and unskillful as unskillful The context of the Sutta is what you should have fear and terror which is unskilful means. Buddha says he has the opposite quality hence there is no fear and terror. 

head and around the heart Also keep in mind. When something happens in the mind also bodily sensations arise. When something happens in the body metal sensations arise. 

What you believe in may just be your perception and not reality. Whatever you should be able to verify at the experiential level then you should look up to it. Since you know it from experience no external person needs to convince you of it. 

Even outside Buddhism there is a saying your past catches up with you. In the Buddhist perspective this is termed Karma. 

calms your breath if you practice correctly calms your body and releases tension if you practice correctly makes your bodily feelings more pleasant and tranquil 

When if comes to the Buddhist concept of God (Deva) the main characteristics differentiating them from similar concepts in other religions is: 

I came across a well referenced blog which seems to have merit in par with a paper or article. Just A Little Dust. Also though not a the site The Dharmafarers has a lot of articles and well researched Sutta translations. 

Samsara is the tragedy. If everything happens is determinable by Karma or other deterministic set of laws then there is no motivation and perhaps the chance to leave Samsara. In this case it can be combination of Karama & randomness and wrong view and motivation at play. Such events can be inspiration to strengthen your practice so that such calamity does not befall you in Samsara. 

which covers most part of what is the right way to practice. You can complement this with other Sutta readings. In the Satipatthana Suttas it is mentioned that Satipatthana is the one and only way (ekāyana maggo) for purification of the beings. Also at the end he Buddha gives a guarantee that if it is practiced the right way (as per the instructions given) you can get the fruit or Non Returner or Fully Liberated within 7 days. When i concentrate on that feeling, i will either yawn/ tears coming out or even deep sign. Then i will feel better after every 'reaction'. This can be due to past Sankhara. Past conditioning causes unpleasant experiences when they surface and manifest themselves. E.g. you have past Karma to break a leg. But you are in meditation. This may surface as a severe pain in the leg but since there is not other conditions for an accident this will pass away. When some feeling arise in me, most of the time, i can noting the feeling was somewhere in the body( example: scare feeling near my abdomen/ back of my body). Getting sensitive to sensations is a good thing. You have to see how this lead to unwholesome states. 

Longer the better as more you rub two sticks together then you can get fire. But for people to watch out for is if you are putting too much effort. So if you feel mentally or physically wore out or tired after a session you are doing it too long and perhaps you should reduce the time. Generally 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening / night is good enough. 

(Magga) Vibhaṅga Sutta So you should be mindful of body, feelings, mind and phenomena without attachment or aversion. Attachment and aversion arises due to sensation / feelings (Vedanā) so when any sensation arise just know impermanence and be equanimous to any feeling which arises. Also you should guard you sense doors. 

The going to war is in many cases beyond your control and even if it is it is governed by norms and even law. Say another country declares war then you might not be able to do nothing. This these case if you have exhausted the avenues to stay away you might have to participate. This is not justifiable by the Dhamma but you have to comply with the laws of the land. Also be mindful of the Karmic repercussions and try to do somethings to counteract this perhaps like Metta Bhavana, helping the wounded, etc. when you can. If you look back at Buddha's time, even his devoted disciples hard to go on war. E.g. Ajatashatru. This is a worldly norm. You can not endorse them, as any for of offensive is not endorsed in Buddhism, but they cannot be avoided and eradicated. 

Dukkha is the characteristic of all human experiences (or what is felt) either pleasant, painful or neutral. Pain is Dukkha in it's own right. Parting with pleasantness is Dukkha. Also any conditioned existance is Dukkha even in the neutral experiences as becoming is present which has inherent suffering like birth, aging, painful life experiences and death . 

Each of the 4 triads corresponds to the above. In the process you have to calm all the fabrications. 

Source: Piya Tan's Summary of (Pacchā,bhūma,gāmikā) Deva,daha Sutta The teachings should encompass cultivating and promoting which is the true purpose of teaching the Dhamma: 

In Buddhist meditation there are also techniques to recollect past lives. For this you have to develop abhiññā through Jhana. 

Similarly craving which is not explicitly a part of the 4 Nutrimens but found in the explanation hence an integral part of both: 

Pahāna Sutta Many disturbance during mediation originates due to a physical sensation of mental sensations. Say past memories come up, this also is due to the sensation a stimuli has brought about. Also when fabrications arise due to distraction your breath will lose its smoothness. How to handle this is: 

Perceptions don't completely disappear until enlightenment. Sensations is the mind conditioner, hence any volitional formations or mental reaction due to perception will have a sensation associated with it. What you have to do is to look at the sensations equanimously without craving and clinging. This way you are not creating new fabrications due to perception and volitional formations. You cannot get rid off perception altogether until the final leg of the journey. Mental activities will have an impact on your bodily fabrications also, hence when possible, while engaging in your normal activities, have a look at your breathing, heartbeat, perspiration (not due to external influences like weather). If there is an irregularity start looking at the full cycle of breathing noting it's speed and length also watching the sensation on the upper lip. As the bodily function calm you will experience better sensation in your body hence better mental state. (Don't crave or long for either.) Also when you see something look at the sensations around your eyes and your head as you perceive it. Similarly to other sense inputs. When you are sitting in some posture by sensing the outline of your body though feelings on the body. Similarly when you walk, in which case you can see the sensation when your feet touch the ground maybe clothing touching your body when you move around the moving parts of your body. Then look at your body part by part by moving your attention to the relevant part, without trying to visualize, verbalize, imagine the part (otherwise you are dealing with concepts and / or verbal fabrications) Also you meet people you will form perceptions about them. If it is not good try to develop compassion. It is is good do not get attached. If it is lustful think if their parts are separated whether you would consider the person beautiful (including you self). Again for food craving imagine excretion. When doing this be mindful of the sensation such actions create. If companion or sense of morality has made you loose the balance of your mind like you do not want to walk fearing that you might step on an insect then your perception has polarised in the opposite direction. The reason to practice antidotes to certain perception should generally be done in a situation when a stimuli causes a sensation which triggers associated memories or thoughts which further trigger sensation snowballing. The antidote is to neutralise the sensation to manageable levels so you mental balance is restored. If you perceive food as repulsive in a office party so you do not become glutton, but in effect loose apatite or feel like throwing up or even worse like become anorexic then you are going overboard in the opposite polarity. In either cause repulsiveness has sensation associated with it which can tell you if your have gone too far. You have to do all this in such a way that others don't see something odd in you. Also you should not slack in order to do this or in anyway compromise on your work and responsibilities. Most of all sensation is the most important thing to pay attention in such a situation and it where all the aggregates meet and the bridge physical fabrication and metal fabrications. Your mind is always in touch with sensations and activities driven by sensations. Things trickle down and up from these ends (Kaya to and from Dhamma). This is the best you can do while engaging in another activity at work in my opinion. 

You simply have to know the presence of the sensation, know it is arising and passing and be equanimous without getting attached to it. Attachment to pleasant sensation gives arise to the unwholesome root of craving. [Pahāna Sutta] 

When you meditate there are sometimes "storms" or big mental disturbances that happen. So it is generally advise to have a guidance of a teacher through this is not necessary. What generally happens is you react and worsen the situation. No matter what you should not loose the balance of your mind. You should be always equanimous. If you can do this there then you are fit to do meditation through books and other sources without a guidance of a teacher. 

From what I think, stomach juices from if you keep thing about food or feel hungry. Whenever hunger arises if you are equanimous then and do not have this lead to thoughts about food and food craving then your stomach will become inactive and also hunger will subside. You can use the sensation of hunger as an object of insight meditation. This is how I whether it you when I am in retreats. Also when you are occupied there is tendency you feel hunger less. In such situation if thoughts about food does not arise I guess your body will not react by producing stomach juices. Also one purpose of not eating after noon is to make time and also make practicing meditation easier. So if you are in mediation for most of the day you do not tend to get these issues. You do not burn much calories to get hungry. You would not be thinking about food. You would also had a lite diet. Hunger is a flavor of aversion which you should try to avoid arising.
