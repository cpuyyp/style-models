Bicycles, like many machines, are efficient, but a large amount of energy converted by them is not in fact used for their "intended" purpose: The largest energy sink is air/wind resistance, which you can only very marginally improve on a "normal" bike†. However, wind resistance squares in relation to your speed, so maintaining a more leisurely pace would improve your efficiency. For example, people riding on cross-continental tours actually ride pretty slowly compared to e.g. people riding a road bike for training: They do this so that they can put in longer distances over the whole day rather than pushing themselves as hard as possible for e.g. 5 hours and then being destroyed for at least a day. The second biggest contributor to the bicycle's lost efficiency is rolling resistance, as you seem to already realize; Therefore, getting a bicycle with proper road tires will drastically improve your riding speed and efficiency over riding a bike with heavy-tread mountain bike tires. As a real-life example, I can easily handle 50+ km in a few hours on a 40-year-old ten-speed without really "pushing" myself past my limit but on a mountain bike this would probably kill me. Lastly, weight is very important when riding over hilly terrain but less important on the flats. However, you stated that you are riding over hilly terrain, so reducing overall bicycle weight might actually make a big difference for you even if it doesn't improve actual mechanical efficiency much: Humans are extremely complicated machines and we only have a very narrow power band, quickly becoming exhausted once we leave this particular "sweet spot" of cadence and load: If your cadence is too high you run out of breath but if your load is too high your body starts using anaerobic power and builds up lactic acid in your muscles, which wears them out. TL; DR If you have the money, go look for a decent used road bike (even if it's old, it's likely going to be more efficient than a fancy new mountain bike)-- if not, go look for decent road tires for your current bike. However, no matter what you do, ride your bike at a casual pace because you'll go further without getting worn out. 

I have very little living/working space of my own and so, in order to keep my personal bike in working order, I need to be able to transport "bike mechanic stuff" (e.g. tools, screws, cables, inner tubes, etc.) in an efficient, safe way to places where I can work on my bike and have access to bigger things I can't own (e.g. repair/truing stands). Additionally, I need to be able to have these assorted things well-organized and easy to move without a lot of packing/unpacking: I've had stuff stolen† from me while using communal workspaces which were busy because I either had stuff spread out so far that it wasn't quite within my "personal bubble" of control or I had to leave my space looking for something and, when I came back, something important was missing. Finally, even without the threat of theft, I nearly always lose at least one washer/screw/annoyingly-small thing when working on my bike. Since I assume I'm not the only person in the world who has this sort of situation, are there any sort of guidelines on ways to quickly and efficiently store/transport bike repair/maintenance gear on one's person (e.g. in a backpack)?-- I haven't got a car, so I need to be able to easily carry it myself. 

How can I fit a bell to my bike which is durable enough to survive lots of vibration and yet still be easily accessible from the drops? 

but I can't seem to reproduce the sound when not riding. What might it be? What steps can I take to diagnose this? 

Are there any modern road/light touring tires which look like the gumwall tires of yesteryear? In particular, I'm looking for all-weather road tires with serious puncture resistance, i.e. a more-or-less-direct competitor to Schwalbe's Marathon line. 

I'm trying to identify the exact year/model of a Motobecane called the "Special Sport", which was bought in France. I don't know if the parts are all original, however: It has a Huret Svelto rear derailleur, but I can't tell what model the Huret front derailleur is. It has Motobecane-branded center-pull brakes. Lastly, it has a Maillard Helicomatic rear hub, which would suggest to me that it's an early-'80s model, but the rest of the bike doesn't look very '80s at all. 

I've got a cheap LED lamp running on three AAA NiMH batteries which stops working when exposed to near-freezing temperatures; is there a likely reason for this? 

This is definitely not what a mountain bike is for: They are intended for serious trail use, i.e. broken paths with lots of obstacles/debris. Given what you're describing and your beginning riding "style", I'd personally recommend either a lower-end touring or hybrid bike with tires more meant for off-road use: They will be more comfortable to ride for longer periods, will be easier/more enjoyable to ride fast (less rolling resistance) and can be easily used for stuff other than trail riding such as hauling groceries with a rack and panniers. Mountain bikes are a pain to use for anything other than, well, mountains†. However, in order to get a new bike which you will really enjoy riding and can depend on for a long period of time without it breaking, you'll unfortunately have to spend a lot more than $350 USD (cf. a 2015 ranking of good entry-level mountain bikes, on which most start at around $500). Unfortunately, although bikes at e.g. Walmart may be in that price range, you will regret spending that much when just a few hundred more will get you a very respectable machine. However, you can find a great deal on a used mid-range bike on sites such as craigslist: By buying used, you save the instant "drive it off the lot" depreciation which comes with a brand-new machine. If you don't know anyone who can help you find a good deal on a used bike, however (it's like buying a used car: be careful and always be ready to pay for repairs after buying it), many reputable LBSs will have a few used bikes for sale or will know someone who does. 

† You can significantly reduce wind resistance by riding a bike with full fairings but, for your stated purposes, this would be a bit ridiculous. 

On this old road bike, Bianchi's famous "celeste" color has a pastel-ish hue and a metallic luster. New (2015 Bianchi Specialissima) 

I've (supposedly) got a 1976 Motobecane Le Champion with what appears to be the original center-pull rim brakes, which unforunately are not in one piece and need to be re-assembled: 

In the photo above, I threaded the strap in the "opposite" direction to that of how Sheldon Brown threaded leather straps in order to try to keep the large amount of extra length "inside" the pedal rather than going down and "away from" the bike frame, which might lead it to e.g. dragging on the ground (my bottom bracket is rather low, as can be seen in the photo). However, just like Sheldon, I twisted the strap 360° as it passes through the pedal in order to keep it from sliding out of position. However, I have a feeling I'm "doing it wrong" because I've never seen pedal straps with this much slack before. Furthermore, on the web there are photos of very similar (but not identical) straps which have the rest somehow "tucked" away: 

Lastly, on the right side of the fender, as pictured above, there is a somewhat shallower and "wider" dent which also appeared after transporting the bike. How can I re-shape the fender so that it is not "creased" and not dented? 

It turns out that the "washer" is upside down in the photo: The flanges on the sides of the washer are perfectly flat on one side but are slightly curved on the other. By flipping the washer over so that the flat side faces the bell and the curved side faces the handlebar, the flanges then protrude ever-so-slightly away from the handlebars. With this slight difference, there is enough friction between the edges of the flanges and the respective edges of the holes in the bracket to catch and hold the bracket in place. In order to put the washer in place on the screw so that it can be tightened, a flathead screwdriver can be placed between the handlebar itself and the washer, gently pushing the washer upwards towards the screw and holding it in place while the screw is tightened. Once the screw is tightened enough, the flanges will catch on the holes in the bracket and then begin to pull the ends of bracket together, which will then keep the bell securely on the handlebar through this tension. 

Are there no "baby steps" I can try to do in order to get myself to corner properly and aggressively and yet to trust myself/my bike at the same time? 

Unfortunately, I've got the fine motor skill of an elephant. This in combination with wearing thick winter gloves, being tired during/after riding and everything being wet and slippery means that I drop bike lights a lot. Somehow, I think that I might not be the only person to have these struggles in winter, so what can I do to attach/detach/carry bike lights in winter without dropping them? — I can't leave them on because they will get stolen. The temperatures are often below -10°C, which means that taking my gloves off even for a few seconds is extremely painful and they go numb... and then my hands are even more useless than before. 

Disassemble both arms. Start with the innermost arm, squeezing the arm into place so that, when it is in its "resting" position, the spring lies inside the two respective hooks on the inner plate and the arm itself. Screw the retaining bolt for the inner arm all the way, so that the arm remains on the bike without falling off. Grab the second (outermost) arm. Put the retaining bolt into the arm and then push it just barely through so that you have enough space to put the washer on the other side, and do so. Adhere the bolt to the arm temporarily by covering the head of the washer in adhesive tape and then wrapping it around the arm so that it holds the bolt in place by itself. Cut a ring in the tape inside the washer so that the bolt can be screwed in easily. Squeeze the second arm into place in a similar fashion to that used for the first arm and hold it in that position with your hand. In order to keep the spring from "jumping" out of place, push the retaining bolt through the washer and into the retaining plate. Hold the entire assembly together by pushing on the head of the bolt with your thumb. With your thumb on the bolt, it is now possible to release your hand grip on the arm itself and then to use the hand to properly position the bolt into the plate and then screw the bolt securely into the plate.
