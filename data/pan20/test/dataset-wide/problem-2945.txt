Since the ordering them, guided by the rulebook, creates a structure that contains meaning for the reciever. The key point seems rather to be an unawareness/unintrestedness of/in the structure by the person in the room. This creates the clear cut between syntax and semantics. This clear cut also is caused by the rulebook containing 2 languages, which are superimposed by someone who isn't the person in the room that just understands one and shuffles expressions of the other language around. This unintrestedness poses the question, that given the temporal structure of the sensory input, does the person in the CRA have the desire to derive the semantic property? Seemingly not he just does his work. Note that the part where you discuss software you seem to distance yourself from what Searle seems to mean since you are arguing about the structures used in the rulebook to transmit the desired semantic properties. Not the CRA itself. To me it seems as if the CRA would mainly focus on the analogy of a single CPU core. So demanding an intresed for the mechanism flipping bits seems problematic. Due to the mentioned above intuition pump your approach seems appropriate but inappropriate aswell. Appropriate since you restructure the intial CRA to make it give better intuitions for possibly more complex computers. However the intial CRA still holds for sympler systems like normal calculators. Others have chosen simular approaches f.e. trying to identify the overall system as relevant, laying more importance on the structure of the rulebook(software). I myself tryed this by reformulating the CRA to appear more like a nervcell and adding it with other modiefied CRA's together to get a 3D brain like structure. My conclusion is that the CRA illustrates the wrong level of analysis for complex systems. Therefore I view your approach as inappropriat since the choosing the CRA as model seems unnecessary to general questions you seem to express. Like how does a semantic in a system arise. Or what exactly is semantics, how does complexity affect semantics ect. 

As far as I am aware, its a standard distinction. The idea is that the appropriate reference of lots of terms is not directly known by everyone, but we all use those terms correctly because we interact in some more or less direct manner, with the experts. An example might be `brain'. Putnam is a semantic externalist, so he holds that there must be some connection between brains' to refer to brains. However, I have never seen a brain not had anything to do with one. This does not stop me from referring to brains because I have an appropriate, indirect, connection to people who do see brains etc. Thus, there is a division in linguistic labour: I rely on others to ensure that the reference of some of my terms is correct. 

The way I think about it is as follows: the ontology of a theory is given by the variables we quantify over to express the theory. The ideology is given by the semantics: what we take the predicates to be referring to (hence, not just truth-conditions). 

Let ZFC2 be the Second-Order formalisation of ZFC. The Second-Order Axiom schema of Comprehension (part of the deductive system for SOL) says that for every formula (of SOL) there is a relation with the same extension (shapiro 1991). If we formalise ZFC2, then the domain is all sets and the second-order quantifiers range over all the subsets of the domain. But then, what stops Russell's Paradox from arising? I know it doesn't because ZFC2 is equivalent to Morse-Kelley set theory. 

I do not know Sanskrit, but from the context and nature of the discussion taking place, I do not believe that corruption here means 'sexualy fallen'. This sounds like a modern and rather coarse interpretation, put forward by someone what fails to recognize what is undoubtedly a metaphorical reference. I will attempt 'transpose' from Judaic Kabbalistic tradition, with which I am intimately familiar. Many scholars consider this tradition closely related to Hinduism - either derived therefrom or springing from the same source: In very general terms, 'women', the feminine principle, represent 'Earth' - the physical manifestation and implementation of the stage God erected to afford Man the opportunity to Act. 'when women are corrupted': when the tenets of 'the natural order' and innate morality are violated (call them "the Laws of Earth"): 'Disorder is born in societyâ€™. Edit: Michael Dorfman has weighed in with what is apparently an authoritative Hindu source that translates the verse differently. Based on that translation, my interpretation here is incorrect - although the foundations on which I based it are not. 

I have always believed that they are indeed one and the same. My own observations, acquired through years of working in the world of big business and finance (Wall Street) support this. But to take this a bit further, and perhaps to counter Dzmitry Tsapkou's learned and astute contention, 'The Law of Jungle', as one might call Hobbes's principle, has produced a very balanced, albeit savage, ecosystem: In the rain forest, and in the natural world at large, we do not find that monopolies develop. Instead we find that many organisms live together, both in competition with one another and in symbiotic relationships, each finding its own niche and means of survival. Perhaps this is the best example we have of 'perfect competition'. I object to those who claim 'capitalism' and entrepreneurially oriented economic systems come about 'by design' and can be replaced with others, such as Marxism: Smith's model is simply 'the natural order of things' when groups of humans congregate and engage in business and commerce. 

Therefore the Tyranis(Dictatorship) is generally seperated from Democracy based on the Amount of citizens having a say and possibly the Form (depends on your understanding of Democracy). The Dictator focuses on his Egoistic Goals enriching himself on the cost of the citizens. The understanding of Democracy varies depending on who you read. While Aristotle sees Polity as the legitimit form and Democracy(random selection of officials common in ancient athens see: Demarchy) as the illegitimit form. Polity is understood in this context as Constitutational Parlamentary Governement decided by enlightend citizens. This section is mainly to show the broadness of the Terminology. I support more the distinguishing with the Terms of Polybios to address the modern situation. Where Democracy is a positiv Term. In opposition to democracy you have Ochlocracy or "mob-rule" as the negative form of "All". We arrive at grave Problems when looking at communism, since A) communism is again a very broad often used and missused term and B) establishing the Form of Communism. I want to focus first on B) here. Polybios describes a Anacyclosis(cyclical theory of constitutions/political evolution). Since communism sees it self as "freeing of the cycles of the past" it is debatable if the forms used to describe historical cyclical occuring patterns can be used for communism at all. Or in other words if forms of state organisation can be used to describe something thats not a state. (Now comes the rather personal understanding of me part.) However if we view forms as relational structures between a group of people the application is justified. To simplify matters in this regard it seems to be the easiest to conceptualize communism as special form of anarchism. The relations between the people are power relations. Power has the characteristic of not being distributed equally in any given time. Furthermore power can be subdivided into authority(accepting someone freely) and violence(usage of physical intimidation to generate acceptance). State forms organize the power distribution in a certain way using usually authority and violence but to different degrees. Anarchism/Anarchistic states(f.e. revolution or civil wars) (often) do not organize or organize to a lesser degree. Leading to a more "law of the jungle/mob-like" power structure that is prone to demagoges (Robespierre/Hitler/Lenin/Mao/Pol-Pot/Kim Il-sung/Mussolini ect.). Making it's form the bad "All" form, where basically anyone can rise to power, where traits needed are bruttality and deception to hold your position. Polybios describes in his Anacyclosis that 1 monarchy becomes(->) 2 Kingship -> 3 tyranny -> 4 aristocracy -> 5 oligarchy -> 6 democracy -> 7 ochlocracy ->1. I however think the 7 -> 1 part is questionable. It seems to be the case that out of 7, 3 arises aswell/or at least rather quick. Since you need violence to cement your position. (See Party Purges under lenin 1921, aswell as founding f.e. the cheka) We can therefore conclude that communism understood as anarchistic is a very unstable state of powerrelations that tends to lead to tyrany and violence seemingly following the Anacyclosis more or less. However to have a bit a clearer understanding of communism we should look at it a bit more closley (A). Communism is an Idealism, based on an idealized view of reality(humans are per definition good, power can be evenly distributed, ect.) and fundamentally fails at this part. Positive intention does not implie positive outcome. The supporters of this totalitarian ideology fail to see the necessary leading to totalitarianism due to the idealized nature of communism. Because the supporters imply that the positive intention is sufficient. The idealization itself makes communism force people to being something their not, demanding a control and forcing structure (communistic parties) that guarantees that they stay something they are not. This structure accumulates power and as history shows missuses this power(f.e. killing mentally retarded people for "not being equal enough"). Consider that communism is not based on the usage of violence(violence is only used to transition to communism), since violence seems to imply an illegitimate state like powerstructure. It rather is based on authority of certain ideas that should be morally ensured. However we know that based on variations of Individuals in morality of Populations that there exist extreme cases of moral frameworks despite the moral dominant frameworks not supporting it at all (f.e. serial killers, pedophiles ect.). If the state doesn't exist as a framework of violent power negating/punishing this acts of violence by individuals, theres either no structure to prevent murder, or it is based on initiative of self proclaimed protectors, that themself have a specific moral framework which themself justifiy their violence and accumlate power. However unlike democracy that limits the competence of the people with justification to use violence, this is not the case for the "communist case" where it's unrestricted and mob-like vengeance actions like killing the pedophile/serial-killer can take place. Which itself leads to overextensiv use of force generally leading to a tyranny of "one" or "some" powerfull people. The acummulation of power does never end since the idealized state is never realised, therefore one can always justify new restrictions torwards possible opponents by drawing the lines closer and closer to ones personal view. So a communist state is an utopia that can not be reached. It also seems to attract people who see themself as godlike figures that could, if only given the chance, create a real communist utopia and cure the world. Overestimating themself by idealizing themself, this is not only arrogant but also false. There are plenty of countries that have become communist states, they all are expieriencing simular outcome despite vastly different cultural backgrounds. If the result is always the same thats what communism looks like. Just because it's not how you expected the process to turn out doesn't negate the fact that it is what happens when you implement communism. The result is that it is a failure with tens of Millions of Dead people in just one century, everytime leading to totalitarian dictatorship and godlike person cult. Breading on the positive intentions of the naivie dreamers to create a fall of the current structure to allow powerhungry maniacs, that don't want to obey conventional moral/cultural laws, to rise to the top, and rather use violence to achieve their goal namley being in power. Making Democracy a just and legitimate system, while communism is a demagogic illegitimate system that leads to unnecessary harm and death. I personally hope this ideology is dead for good. 

I am aware that a similar question was asked about the type theory in the principia, but I'm more interested in what the relationship between, say Martin-Lof Type theory and intuitionistic logic is. 

The clearest example, in my opinion, is `on denoting'. There, a logical analysis of the definite description in language is used to offer an account of how we can meaningfully talk about non-existent objects, such as unicorns, without having to commit ourselves to their existence (as abstract object, for example) - see meinong for such a view. The way Russell did this was to analyse a proposition such as `the present king of France is bald' as, there is an x((x is the king of france and x is bald) and, for any y, (if y is the king of france then y=x)). This then allows us to talk about the present king of france or unicorns without having to commit ourselves to the existence of such things. 

There is a large literature on this: priest has two relevant chapters in his doubt truth to be a liar. It is true that there are many logics, all of which are more suited to some purposes than others. However, this does not preclude there being one true logic in W's sense of the term. The thing to bear in mind is what the purpose of logic is. The philosophically interesting one, which W plausible held, is to capture logical consequence (See Dummett's Justification of Deduction for an argument that this must be prior to any other concept). Hence, if we are not pluralists about logical consequence (Beall and Restall are an example of such pluralists) we should think that there is a single notion of logical consequence we are attempting to capture. The logic that does this would be the one true logic. The other logics we have are appropriate for other purposes, or where the domain allows us to add further restrictions on the consequence relation. But from the mere fact that there are different logics we are unawarranted in concluding that there is no one true logic. I think this is all irrelevant to concerns about the supernatural. One should always, in my view, be careful about reading too much into logic -see for example those that misuse Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems. 

The first philosophers had no sources and no vocabulary other than what their own powers of reason could muster. But the attitude many on this site seem to take regarding "philosophy" reminds me of the attitude of classical musicians: Anything that does not fall within their accepted tradition and uses their accepted terminology is not worthy of serious consideration, ignoring the fact that much of what is today considered "classical music" was once "popular music". (Beethoven as a pianist might be categorized as a jazz musician today, based on his inventive and improvisational approach.) It seems that such an attitude endangers the pursuit of "philosophy" and risks bring about its eventual extinction - much as classical music today is limited to a very small audience relative to the population as a whole. This is a loss both to the public at large and to the 'classical community'. To quote the well known jazz musician, composer and critic Leonard Feather: 

Punishment for murder is meted out for the action, the deed, of killing someone, not for the intent to do so, demonstrated by the attempt to murder: Intent to kill is reprehensible, but no physical harm has been inflicted on the intended victim. So morally, the iniquity is less than when the deed has been committed and the intended harm is inflicted on the victim. Therefore attempted murder is a less severe crime. As a less severe crime, it is moral and just that the punishment for attempted murder be less than murder itself. 

As far as I know, there is no specific branch of philosophy that deals with superstitions. Philosophy, within its various subsets, can be thought of as the study and justification of beliefs so, for example, within theology religious superstitions will be assessed. However, there is no specific discipline tasked with finding superstitions and debunking them. 

As an addendum to Alexander's answer, what you find sometimes is that what is denied is the reality of the future. The idea, that can be linked to Dummett, is that, because statements about the future (e.g. tomorrow it will rain) do not have a fixed truth-value, we should be anti-realists about it. This should not be interpreted quite as saying that the future doesn't exist or that talk of the future is illegitimate though; one might, for instance, think that we ought to reason intuitionistically about the future. Of course, fatalists deny that statements about the future don't have a fixed truth-value. 

Haacks Philosophies of Logics (or something similar, I don't remember the exact title) is a classic. Dummett's Logical Basis of Metaphysics, which Mauro Allegranza suggested, is one of the most exiting texts in the field, in my opinion. However, it is also difficult - very difficult in parts. So before reading that I'd suggest Dummett's philosophical basis of Intuitionism (also the final chapter of his elements of intuitionism) and justification of deduction. [Both of these papers are available in `Truth and Other enigmas]. 

In his "The French Revolution, a History", 3.3.II, Thomas Carlyle writes the following: "for all battle is well said to be misunderstanding" He is speaking in reference to the terrible conflict between the Girondins and the Jacobins, after the execution of Louis the XVI in 1793. Both sides envisioned a grand Republic of France, but according to Carlyle, they fought to the death because they misunderstood each other's visions of how that republic should be implemented. I am troubled by this passage: I understand that many 'battles' are indeed the result of misunderstanding - often our words or actions do not accurately reflect our thoughts and emotions, or are misconstrued by others. The result is often conflict. Perhaps that was indeed the case with the Girondins and the Jacobins. My gut reaction to Carlyle's assertion is that he's unquestionably wrong: There are many battles, perhaps the greatest battles that have been fought, that are not due to misunderstanding, but arise from deep seated conflicts of interest or world views that are in direct opposition: "Good vs Evil"; "Haves vs Have Nots"; "Conservative vs Progressive", etc. I found that Kant in "Metaphysical Elements of Justice", states: "in the right of nations to go to war and to carry on hostilities is the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured; and this is done because in that state the method of a juridical process, although the only one proper to settle such disputes, cannot be adopted" This point of view seems clearly at odds with that expressed by Carlyle: Can we say that "the legitimate way by which they prosecute their rights by their own power when they regard themselves as injured" can be interpreted as simply a misunderstanding? A state regards itself as injured because it misunderstood the intentions of its enemies? If State A cuts off the water supply of State B and State A goes to war with State B because of such, what misunderstanding is there? Nietzsche: Ecce Homo - "It is nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism to expect very much (or even, much only) from humanity when it has forgotten how to wage war." Can Nietzsche's assertion here (and in many other places) that the waging of war is a fundamental and essential component of the human spirit be resolved with Carlyle's contention? Carlyle's opinion seems quite clear: if people would simply take the time to sit down and talk to one another and clear up their 'misunderstandings', the conflicting points of view that lead to conflict could be resolved - 'understood' - and there would be no need for 'battle'. It seems that Carlyle longs for state of affairs that Nietzsche would deem "nothing but fanaticism and beautiful soulism". One quite graphic historical example that seems to fly in face of Carlyle's statement is WW II: Hitler's belief in Aryan supremacy spawned in him endless ambition and a sense of entitlement, and so he set out to conquer Europe and eventually the USA, in the belief that such was the destiny of the Aryan Nation. There was no misunderstanding about it: Hitler's idealogy (his madness....) spurred him to attempt to conquer the Western World (eventually the entire world...) and if other nations did not go to war against him, he would have proceeded to do exactly that. I could cite numerous other examples from History. Thought Experiment: Two adjacent states, one in the north, and the other south of the first. There is a river that runs north/south and supplies water to both states. Over time, the population of the northerly state increases such that they deem it necessary to dam the river to supply water to their growing population, thereby cutting off the water supply of the southerly state. As a result, the southerly state wages a war against its northern neighbor, to prevent it from damming the river. How would Carlyle explain such a conflict? Where is the misunderstanding that caused this conflict? The actions of the northerly state are in direct conflict with the interests of its neighbor to the south, simply due to its own need to supply its grown population with water. There was no misunderstanding that seeded this conflict. (And I believe that my thought experiment is far more than just that: Throughout History, wars have been waged due to exactly such circumstances) From what I know of Carlyle, his roots and outlook were decidedly Christian. Is his assertion a reflection of a Christian or Utopian point of view? The longing for a day when there will no longer be 'misunderstandings'? Do the lessons of History refute Carlyle's assertion? Who expresses a philosophical position in direct opposition to Carlyle's? What is the basis for their position?
