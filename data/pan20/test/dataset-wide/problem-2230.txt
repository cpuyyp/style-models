Based upon the IIHF's records of registered hockey players by country, Finland and Sweden have nearing 10 times as many people participating in organized hockey leagues compared to Norway. Additionally the average attendance in the top level hockey leagues are: 

I've got no particularly interest in what the game was, but dug into the stats a bit... a couple good ones that stand out from this SB Nation article: 

and that the play-by-play shows Bryant's shots being listed as pullups 12 times tonight. If anyone has any access to better stats from tonight's game, that'd be great to compare to. But while he chucked a ton of threes... he also scored a lot inside tonight. And from the few highlights I saw, they were reasonably contested shots. So it probably wasn't quite just catch and shoot ball, despite the insane number of shots. Coincidentally, the Lakers did shoot 48% on the night, quite a healthy number (41% is their season average). So their offense was working reasonably. Kobe took a lot of shots, and his 44% FG was fair, but he also allowed the rest of the team to get off real quality shots (or they just had a lucky night?) playing this way. The offense running well when Kobe shot a lot... that's what I think we all remember his championship teams were known for. Coincidentally, the Jazz were the 9th best defensive efficiency team this year [Sporting Charts]. So generally a good D. That the Jazz' six 10+ ppg guys played 63 minutes less tonight than they did against the Mavs Monday is noticeable. And on defense, specifically noteworthy is that starting SG Rodney Hood... the Jazz' only guard [still with the team] forcing a lower shooting percentage to the players they guard compared to their average... only played 18 minutes tonight, compared to 34 on Monday. And certainly cannot forget, the Jazz were eliminated from the playoffs shortly before the game. So the perfect storm for a passionate Kobe against a heartless Jazz, certainly. Still, you'd think if it really was just the Jazz playing poor defense, whether against Kobe to honor him, or in general just as a product of the situation... the Lakers would've ended up shooting more (and probably better). The Jazz led almost the entire game. So it doesn't seem they just absolutely failed to show up entirely. The Jazz gave up 95.9 ppg while averaging 97.7 this year. The Lakers gave up 106.9 ppg while averaging 97.3 this year. Final score 101-96 The Laker D was the big surprise. And so it doesn't really seem the numbers support that the Jazz gave the Lakers huge favors by playing much take-it-easy-defense. But you can analyze single game stats to death, not sure you can ever make absolutely definitive judgements on them.. but the suggestion seems to be that while the deflated Jazz team (and slightly weaker roster) played some part... it was probably more that Kobe took control of the ball a bit more tonight, and played with a passion a bit more like the "good old days". Consider this: Tonight he shot 44%. That was below his career average. But this year, he only had 13 better shooting games. And 47 worse ones. So, it was really Kobe of old. 

I used the 2016-17 NBA and NCAA (click download PDF) rulebooks, and the 2012-13 Iowa HSAA rulebook (apparently the NFHS rulebook is now pay protected????) The closest definitive rule in American rulebooks appears to be on "disconcerting" during free throws. The NCAA and NFHS rulebooks only mention the term, but the NBA goes on to detail it: 

It would seem these would really help quantify teams that scraped through the tournament and teams that controlled the tournament. Getting a list of at least a few teams at each end of the spectrum, and perhaps average values, would help compare the different victors. 

(There were plenty of cries about the remote possibility of a coin toss in the World Cup group stages a couple years ago. And likewise when it is used to choose the home team for the rare single game MLB playoff qualifier. But to choose who advances to the final?!? And they call PKs a coin toss! Also happened to notice... it just happened in the 2015 African Cup... where the second team to move on from Group D, after tying across the board, was indeed decided in this strange drawing of lots.) Certainly surprising to me to see such parity between the two possibilities. Additionally, 71 goals have been scored in those extra time games, 0.87 goals per extra time on average. 

To extend Fillet's information... to hit a winner, ΔKE would be Δ1/2mv^2, or a total of mv^2 (if players hit at similar speeds). I see suggestions [1] that typical shots are in the 60-80 mph range in men's tennis, and some winners get near 100 mph. So .057*30^2 (for 70ish mph) is 50ish Joules per winner. 41 winners would only be 2 kJ or 0.0006 kWh. Even 100 mph for every winner, that's only 5 kJ = 0.001 kWh. So that doesn't work as anything significant. I'm not sure what Fillet was taking from cyclingweekly (seems to be basically W/kg and to get to kWh, so you'd need to multiply out by mass and then hours expended to be useful)... but alternatively [2] shows 300-600 Calories per hour is a reasonable amount exerted playing tennis. That'd be 1/3 to 2/3 of a kWh each hour per player. So a three hour match easily could burn 3-4 kWh combined between the two players. Can probably get to around 10 kWh in a long pro match, but still an order of magnitude off. One thing Fillet didn't consider is the total shots in the match. I found $URL$ and looked through quite a few... most I got was the Djokovic-Murray 2012 US Open, with just under 2000 shots (add the listed total of shot types for the two each players). At the 70 mph earlier estimate, we're still only talking about 0.02 kWh. Still no useful contribution (makes sense, considering how light a ball is). Seems we're usually tired at the end from running, not from swinging our arm. So, I too can find no way to get near the values they show. The only guess I can think of is that they actually mean kW (power) rather than kWh (energy). I saw rough estimates that the impact of a shot lasts a few milliseconds [3]. That seems reasonable. A 70 mph winner could thus be about 13 J/0.004 seconds, ~ 3 kW. 133 kW total for 41 winners. Finally a number\unit that sounds similar to their answer... though that would vary hugely by speed and contact time, and be tough to reasonably calculate? Long story short, I'm as confused by it as Fillet. 

So, combined with Coach-D's answer on how a snap must be performed, I believe this narrows it down that a person who usually plays as guard can take the snap... but only after they report as eligible (since all backfield players are eligible, and you must be in the backfield to take the snap). That player also cannot return to playing guard until they skip a play (or a timeout, possession change or similar events). 

An option is the choice to continue the deal. So a player option means the player can force the deal to be continued another year (assuming the money is guaranteed, they'll get paid another year... usually used by players who aren't going to find any better contracts), and a team option means the team can force the deal to be continued (the player must stay another year, usually used on players who would be worth more in free agency). There's also early termination options, which for all intents might as well be player options really. Just means the player can leave early (or choose to play the final year). Restricted free agency is similar to a team option... except that they must match any other bids (or let the player go). But they still can ensure you are kept by agreeing to the value others offer. Coincidentally, in many (all?) cases, the team a player is leaving can offer MORE money than any other team can in free agency. So the system is slightly slanted to the team that drafts a player (well, quite a lot, when rookie salary structure is considered). But not enough to prevent the superteams of recent! It's humorous you'd hear it a lot this year... because now would be the one time in history more than any other when player options should basically never be picked up (unless the player's ability has fallen a ton)! There was a 35% increase in money designated to go to players this year... and as you probably saw, that money goes into huge salary increases all around as teams try to spend what they must (see the reactions) (in fact, teams HAVE to add at least about $14 million to their salaries for this year, going from a cap of $70 mill to a minimum payout of $84 mill). (* Basketball Reference suggests 20 teams haven't met this minimum salary as of right now..... they would end up doling the leftover money out among their current players evenly if they don't get to this $84 mill salary floor by season's end [teams like Miami are almost $30 million short right now!!! Equal to a $2-3 million "bonus" per player... all for players value-wise tending to be underskilled and on bad teams! A bonus for putting up with being on a bad team, that's a first!]) But imagine you're a player... you can stick with what you were getting paid last year... or get around 35% more in free agency, basically for free (because everyone has more money and it's there to be spent). And if things aren't lined up right for you this year with the right teams, you could just sign a one year contract with someone, at a significant raise, then try to hit the bank again next year when it's all supposed to rise another 8%. This nba.com story shows a paltry 3/29 (10%) of players took their option [and one was Tim Duncan, who retired afterwards... the others: Caron Butler and Mo Williams, both aging guys who played small minutes last year, and might've struggled to get signed at all (Butler was since waived)] 3/6 (50%) of team options were picked up. Because it's a deal when you can still pay last year's price. 25/37 (68%) of restricted free agents had their contracts matched (I guess if you have the great excess of money, and like a player enough to have played him last year, you're probably going to pay to keep him generally). Long story short, not a year for seeing player options exercised. And probably won't be for the next three offseasons either, as players with long-term contracts that are across-the-board 40%+ under market value end, and they'll want that same raise the rest of the league has gotten! Here is a list of upcoming options at Spotrac. Looking at Duncan, Williams, Butler, and Durant (yes he really does have an option next year... and so he'll almost certainly be opting out... and we could be seeing all this again in a year... to go with Curry, James, Griffin, Westbrook, Paul, Lowry, Ibaka, Rose, and Wade), it seems there's no set number or percentage of how much an option goes up, but indeed it can't go down. Most follow the trend of their contract for the first 4 years... go up a few % each year. But up to how teams set up the initial deal. Also came across $URL$ which has an absolute PILE of salary details that blow the mind! According to that, can only put one if player option, team option, or early termination in a contract, and only for final season. And finally, coincidentally, turns out, though you don't hear about them nearly as often (commonly due to other big buzz terms more unique to each game), the NFL (I hear franchise tag morel and MLB (I hear arbitration more) have option contracts as well. And apparently they're showing up more often in baseball too. 

While the NFL hasn't had many even occasional one-platoon players in the Super Bowl era, Arena Football was rather popular doing so. For its first 20 years [1987-2007], most players played offense and defense [it appears it was 8 on a side, only two of which were one-way players (QB+offensive specialist vs 2 defense specialists)]. The league had an Iron Man Award to celebrate the best two-way player. Found $URL$ which lists a committee's 25 greatest of all times. Barry Wagner apparently holds both the career records for most receiving yards... and for most fumbles caused? Not bad! 

This indeed has a mean just over 6'7". Mode as indicated is 6'9". Median is 6'7". And a standard deviation of about 3.5" inches just for good statistical completeness (even looks loosely normal, which is a tad surprising). Would be nice to break down by position (or limit it to starters), but the wouldn't do that for me despite suggesting it would. Unfortunately there also was no minutes played option. Gotta be pretty tall, eh!?! 

But that's only free throws. As to shooting itself... funny enough, there's more clarity on another form of distraction that is often uncalled or not known about: 

So, what is the best way to respond if the offense elects to go to a 3 wide receiver set (replacing the fullback with a third receiver, usually lined up in the slot [somewhere inward from one of the other two wide receivers])? Pulling one of the cornerbacks in to cover the slot receiver leaves a big question mark of how to cover the receiver he is leaving. It is unlikely anyone else on the team can match up with that receiver one-on-one. Pulling a safety in leaves less protection and more room for the primary receivers or running backs to bust huge plays. Linemen are usually too big and slow to be much help on a receiver. So as I understand it, that often leaves the linebackers as often the best option. Usually the matchup doesn't work out to be too bad. Because unlike the two standard receiver positions... the weak-side receiver (which generally has little focus on strength, since most runs are to the other side [where the tight end is] means this receiver rarely has to get involved in blocking)... and the flanking receiver (who usually has a lot of reliance put on size, working to give him dominance even in the tightest coverage by his single defender), the slot receiver is usually built to be pretty tough and physical. This is so that he can take the punishment he'll often get, since he generally attempts to catch balls in the intermediate region between the line and secondary... meaning many guys will often be nearby to quickly unload big hits as soon as he catches the ball. If somebody too light and athletic plays the slot, the general thinking is be quite prone to injury. And also may struggle to keep possession after the catch without the strength to face the hits and hold onto the ball. So usually a linebacker will at least line up fairly with a slot receiver. Whereas diverting a cornerback (or safety) to cover him usually risks big play touchdowns. Now, all this isn't to say the matchup is always great. Indeed, just because it can lead to more injuries doesn't mean a team won't play such a formation! And, as noted, linebackers really tend to be built a bit more towards dealing with the bigger guys inside and making lots of tackles. Just a bit of a speed edge might be enough for the slot guy to reap great rewards. Plus, the linebackers also must often help cover the tight end and running backs coming out on passing routes as well, plus contain mobile quarterbacks. This high quality Denver Post explanation and this equally high quality post on FieldGulls.com go into a lot more detail breaking down some of the different positions and matchups within the receivers and secondary. The troubles often really are more indicative of the overall team skill as well. If you have cornerbacks that can be relied upon to hold single coverage with the main wide receivers, then your safeties can play up more. Or if your defensive linemen can really occupy the offensive line, you can drop more linebackers into coverage, giving less room for the extra receivers. But if those guys are struggling, more attention needs to be paid in those other areas. Now, as you hint at, the best response often actually ends up being switching out one (nickle) or two (dime) of the linebackers for more of those faster secondary players. If you have the preparedness and players to make those switches. But this may expose other problems as well. I'm certainly no football mastermind... but maybe the offense was running the ball well with the RBs or QB, preventing the defense from making a LB-to-DB switch, which would further reduce their effectiveness against the run (or that making the switch would fairly obviously set matchups that would unlock a previously contained run game). Or perhaps the slot receiver was just a bit too physical for a safety or cornerback, and a bit too fast for the linebacker, given the amount of time and room he was getting to operate (in other words, the play calling was giving the QB and slot WR too much time to operate). Maybe they just thought that the linebacker they'd take off would cost them more overall than the DB they'd put on. Who knows! But the defense was most likely making changes they thought would help contain the slot receiver, they just weren't working. But indeed, mismatches often do seem like one of those things commentators like to obsessively harp on... even though they often really don't know the complexity behind them! These coaches certainly weren't born yesterday, they've probably been facing slot receivers for decades! It just didn't work out that the coaches choices or the personnel they used were as sharp as they have been on other days, and they came up against a coach/team/player that really showed it up!
