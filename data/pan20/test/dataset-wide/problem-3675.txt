Alcohol, poor sleep is against your training anyway. So one more, or less - is not much change anyway. Note that every well done training is better then sitting at home, even if you would not take 100% of it. Moving from obvious to less obvious things. Usually people decide not to drink, but that works for older... Young people, like you... Heh - please take care, and do things properly, keep yourself far from injury. Just train. I'm a bit jealous seeing young people training, and their progress. But there is one potential problems - it is quite easy to get injured, and that will stay with you... Note that you are training for particular reason, not to take more then others. Just slowly progress, no shortcuts are here, and potential fast forward can lead to serious problems. Please ask another questions about your goals, describing what is your plan, maybe that way someone can better help you. 

First you need proper technique. Elbows close to body, forearms still, back stretched, blade-bones proper position... Kelly Starrett did some videos on that. According to muscles - when I'm failing, I know where the pain is located. From that, usually I know what to train. If I have to bet - deltoids, upper chest, triceps. But if someone argue about abs - I agree as well. 

Sorry for not giving direct answer. Partially that is because it is not my way, partially because I fill there is not enough information here. First of all. Read. Watch youtube channels. How to distinguish if that particular one is good? Well, if they are PHDs, or referring other sources of information, that goes higher. If they say that advices are for all - they go down. All of us are different, and everyone needs to check what works, what is not - that is why I can't provide plan for you. So first advise is to build your own knowledge, by looking others, and trying their advices. Write notes - to see progress. To have evidence what works what not. Our brain can be easily fulled, so notes are much better. Buy a book. Something that gives you some kind of background, on which you can build your knowledge from blogs, vlogs. It can be Kelly Starret, or something like that. Be sure to read criticism - to have better understanding... For the moment I'm reading about Myer's fascials. If you do something do for both - antagonistic muscles. I mean you should train biceps, as well as triceps. That is important, since you don't have access to gym, equipment. Think about push-ups, if you can do pull-ups - it would be great. Since that way you would train chest, and back. For abs I would propose plank. For legs - you can start with wall-sit. That is quite static set. But as starting point should be OK. Try to do 3-4 sets with 10-20 reps - for push-ups. For other exercises - try to have filling of same effort. Note that, and treat as starting point. Having that of some time, perhaps 2-3 months I would advise to buy kettle-bell. Think about 15-18kg. Go to the shop or some other place, where you can grab one and try, which weight, and style fits you best. Idea is that you should not be able to keep it in your straight arm at eye level. To see exercises - find Pavel Tsatsouline. There are many videos at youtube, also there are his books, about kettle-bell, stretching. So we have last point. Read about stretching, and do it. Long, full body stretching is quite stressful for your muscles, so do not put it with your normal load. To deal with it. Spend 10-20 min. at start or at the end. At start do fast, dynamic moves, to get more energy. At the end - slowdown, think about breathing, more yoga style. :) Stretching and mobilization can be something else. To mobilize buy roller, or small ball like for lacrosse. Fast moves on that will activate muscles, and your brain can imminently use new range of move. Do not do ballistic stretching, a specially at the end. That can end your training, or stop you for 2-3 months... Additional question: I've watched so many vids, read so much information that Ive skipped workouts reading etc. I will definitely write notes. I don't quite understand the streatching point. Should I stretch before or after workout? Should those stretches be standard ones or is are there specific vids of it? Also I found this plan on forum. I will do this until I found something better. - Thom :) ... and answers I see you point. There is so much different videos saying "do this", "do that", or "ten steps to have great abs". What to do with it? Try, give it a try. Be careful, watch your body, but... if you don't have clear clue, just try it and check if that works for you. About plan from gyazo. In first section I would move Burpees just after Jumping Jacks. Start with something easy like jumps, and then use most complicated exercises. That, which are heavy, or that which uses many muscles, moves many joints. I would use same start for second part. Later on you can change / shuffle it. Your body will learn the order, so please be sure to change it - let's say every 2-4 weeks. About stretching. I can't recall the book. But I've red that strong, static stretching gives more stress to your muscles. That can pull down your scores, and give more soreness. However if you do mobilization - like with roller - it can be beneficial. For squat you can do something like this - just 10 moves of a kind, without that 30s and longer holds. Concentrate on correctness, and speed. Deep of move will come later. Then jumping jacks ... After training you can do slow stretching, concentrate on position, breath. Going a bit deeper when exhaling... But be careful, and do not do too much. I've tried to do 45 min stretching after normal 50 min training soreness was doubled, so I've stopped. Idea is that not always more is better. As @JohnP spotted. By stretching you give some motion range, and it is good idea to let your brain, and body be aware of that. So separate stretching session can give less then short, fast sessions before actual training. To get it - you need to concentrate on muscles you are going to train, and use dynamic stretching. As a side note. Dynamic stretching and static are addressing different problems. What I wanted to say is to be aware that when you train your muscles it is good to stretch at same time. another question I've found this video for pre workout, and this one for after workout, are they ok/good? This is how my workout looks like now. and answer. Start doing, and watch your body. Do not stress yourself too much. Your initial target is to hold on doing it for 2 months. In that time, you will develop better understanding, muscles, neural connections - all that is needed to carry on. According to pre workout stretching. Be careful with straight leg kicks. That is ballistic move, you are young, so it should not be a problem, but do that at the end of stretching, when your legs, are wormed enough. Other point - try to kip pelvis in a line. When one leg is in front, it should not influence on pelvis, spine. That is why there are mirrors at the gym. :) On the other side - you are training under your weight, you are young - so just start, and do. Remember about notes. Hope to see some comments from you in a month or so! And some more links from NSCA youtube: 

As a first impression. It that is main exercise, for strength I would do 4-6 reps, with weight that guarantee no more reps. There is no plan that would guarantee progress in long time. That is why people have plan for two weeks, and from that small blocks they build phases. So let's say you are in building strength phase. And you planned it for 2 months, so you have 8 smaller blocks. You can think in opposite direction. You have plan to be in perfect shape next summer. You know that - let's say 3 mounts are needed to cut out fat. So you have 3 mounts of mass training, and another 3 of cutting. Any of that phase you divide into 2 weeks, and plan for them. To better track where you are. In terms of final result. In other words idea with that smaller blocks is to have some kind of stability, but also be able to adjust. Phases on the other hand are to give your body different impulses, so at winter time you can build mass, eat a lot, and going to summer, you can cut calories and work on definition. Other option is to work on strength, and then on stamina, speed, coordination, technic - depends on sport. For plan preparing... Try with , or . Search over internet, there are Excel spread sheets, but also good explanations why that way. Just try them see how it goes. 2 weeks, and you will see. Usually I'm just performing exercises to maintain more-or-less same level for most muscles, and targeting particular group. Then switching to other group, and so on. That way I can progress, but maybe not that fast.
