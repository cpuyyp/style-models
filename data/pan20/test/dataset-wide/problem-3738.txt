Yes. See the beginning of section 3 of "Compactifications of subvarieties of tori" by Jenia Tevelev. He has a finitely generated integral domain $A$ (he calls it $\mathcal O(X)$) over an algebraically closed field $k$, and states that it is "well-known" that $A^\ast/k^\ast$ is a finitely generated free group. I Googled a little and I found other statements of this result, but I couldn't find a better reference. Note that if you accept the statement for integral domains, it's not hard to show it for reduced algebras more generally. 

Part of your question is about the relationship between primary decomposition and localization. Here, I think the basic connection is that if $I$ is an ideal in a Noetherian ring $R$ whose minimal primary decomposition is $I = J_1 \cap \cdots \cap J_n$ and $S$ is any multiplicative set in $R$, then a minimal primary decomposition of $(S^{-1} I) \cap R$ consists of those $J_i$ whose associated primes are disjoint from $S$. For example, in Karl's answer, this statement gives two equivalent definitions of the symbolic power by taking $I$ to be a power of a prime ideal $P$ and $S = R \setminus P$. The point is that one way to look at the usefulness of localization is that it simplifies ideals by replacing them with the intersections of only some of their primary components. From this perspective, primary decomposition seems like a more useful way of analyzing ideals since it gives you each primary component by itself. However, the limitation of primary decomposition is that it is not unique (Eisenbud's book explains this very well if I remember correctly). Thus, primary decomposition gives you a mix of useful information about the original ideal together with some information coming from some arbitrary choices you made during the computation. Which aspects of the primary decomposition are uniquely determined by the original ideal? Well, it's the set of associated primes as well as the intersections between any subset of primary components whose associated primes form an downward-closed subset of poset of the associated primes of the original ideal, i.e. exactly those ideals which show up as $(S^{-1} I) \cap R$ for some multiplicative set $S$. I think that some of the distaste for primary decomposition on the part of, for example, Bourbaki, comes from the non-uniqueness, whereas localization can be seen as a way of capturing exactly the unique part of primary decomposition. As came up in the comments, primary decomposition is very useful computationally. Here, the non-uniqueness is not a problem since computations typically depend on many choices anyways. I suspect that in most cases, primary decomposition in and of itself is of less interest than other questions which can be answered from it: the irreducible components of the scheme, which of these are generically reduced, the irreducible components of the non-reduced locus, or whether or not the projective scheme corresponding to a homogeneous ideal is reduced (which is not necessarily the same as whether the affine scheme is reduced). Each of these questions could be answered from the set of associated primes together with the localizations at the minimal primes, but the primary decomposition provides a convenient presentation of all of them. 

This is essentially the vertex enumeration problem in convex geometry. Let $A$ be an $n \times m$ matrix whose columns form a basis the vector space $W$. Then the vectors you're looking for are exactly the products $Av$, where $v \in \mathbb R^m$ generates a ray of the polyhedron defined by $Ay \geq 0$. Thus, up to a linear map, this is the problem of converting from an H-representation to a V-representation of the polyhedron. By duality for convex polyhedra, this is the same as enumerating the defining hyperplanes given the vertex set. I'm not an expert in the algorithms for this problem, but there seems to be a good discussion of the complexity of some algorithms at $URL$ and some further information at other pages on that site. 

No, it is not true. I'm going to describe everything in terms of commutative algebra, so take $X=Y=\operatorname{Spec} R$. Let $G$ be the group $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ with the lexicographic ordering. Let $R$ be any valuation ring with value group $G$ and then $R$ has dimension $2$ since it has exactly three prime ideals, forming the chain: $$\mathfrak m = \{ r \in R \mid v(r) \geq (0, 1) \} \supset \mathfrak p = \{ r \in R \mid v(r) = (a, b) \mbox{ where } a \geq 1\} \supset 0,$$ where $v$ denotes the valuation. Let $t$ be any element of valuation $(0,1)$ so that the vanishing set of $t$ is the single closed point $\mathfrak m$. Thus, $1/t$ is a regular function on $U = X \setminus \mathfrak m$, but $1/t$ is not in $R$ even though $\mathfrak m$ has codimension 2. I think about the result for Noetherian normal rings in terms of two separate results: First, if $R$ is a Noetherian domain, then $R$ is the intersection of $R_{\mathfrak p}$ as $\mathfrak p$ ranges over all associated primes of principal ideals. Second, in a normal Noetherian domain, all associated primes of principal ideals have codimension 1 (this is condition S2 of Serre). I suspect that the first might generalize to non-Noetherian rings, provided that you have the right definition of associated prime. The second fails pretty much as badly as possible, since a single element can generate a prime ideal of arbitrary codimension, or even infinite codimension. 

No, the cardinalities alone are not enough to identify a local commutative ring. For example, you can take $R = \mathbb F_p[x]/\langle x^3 \rangle$ and $S = \mathbb F_p[x,y] / \langle x^2, xy, y^2\rangle$, which both have cardinality $p^3$ with maximal ideal of cardinality $p^2$. A more refined invariant you could ask for is the cardinality of all powers of the maximal ideal instead of just the $0$th and $1$st powers, which is the same information as the Hilbert function. This will distinguish the above two rings because in the first $m_R^2$ has cardinality $p$ but in the second $m_S^2 = 0$ has cardinality $1$. However, again, the Hilbert series alone is not enough to distinguish isomorphism classes of finite local rings. For example, $\mathbb F_p[x,y]/ \langle x^2, y^2\rangle$ and $\mathbb F_p[x,y] / \langle x^3, xy, y^2\rangle$ both have the same Hilbert function, but they are not isomorphic. In general, the problem of classifying finite local rings is impractical for large prime powers. 

Yes this is always possible. What you do is you start with a simple normal crossing resolution $M$. Let $D_1, \ldots, D_k$ be the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor. Then, by the simple normal crossing assumption, for any set of indices $I$ of size $n$, the intersection $\cap_{i \in I} D_i$ is a finite (possibly empty) set of points. Blow up all of these points as $I$ ranges over all sets of size $n$. Now take the strict transforms of the $D_i$ and the $(n-1)$-way intersections of these will be a disjoint union of smooth curves, which we now blow-up. Repeat by blowing up the intersections of the strict transforms of the original divisors in higher and higher dimensions. The final result will have the property that the intersections of any set of divisors (not just pairs) will be either empty or connected. I learned this procedure from Remark 2.1 in a paper by Sam Payne. 

No, this is not true. A counter example is the ideal $\langle xz, yw, xw+yz \rangle$, which has $3$ generators, but has an associated prime of codimension 4 at the origin. I'm not sure how much it explains, but I remember this example as being the ideal of pairs of linear forms whose product is zero, i.e. the coefficients of $(xt + y)(zt + w)$, considered as a polynomial in $t$. This at least lets you see right away that the minimal primes are $\langle x, y\rangle$ and $\langle z, w \rangle$.
