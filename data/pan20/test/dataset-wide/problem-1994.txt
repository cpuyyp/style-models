While this is lengthy, it does cover a few points to ponder that I hope are useful. Take some time to look up each of the capitalized terms and consider how you'd apply the concept that is being discussed as I suspect these questions are intended to be tests of communication skills as well as if you know these terms. Is Safeguarding a company, an application, or merely a process for protecting something? There are a few ways to interpret the term and this is worth doing some digging just to see if it is what you think or don't think as some terms could be company names like Oracle while others may be referring to the use of something like Incident Reporting. As this is for an apprenticeship, it is worth considering that some background information may be expected. For example, restoring from a backup may be part of Data Protection for some people. IT Security could be an alternative part of Data Protection from a rather high level for another way to view this. Last but not least, be careful with your language as things like spelling and grammar may count a great deal. If you have an application with a bunch of typos that may come across as unprofessional. Similarly, if you take a specific interpretation of a term that isn't what they were expecting that could also set a bad impression as you have to remember that context can be quite important. For example, consider the case if they asked, "Please describe your understanding of Diamond." Now, how many different kinds of Diamond do you know? I know of at least a few: 

Something else to consider is when your manager does take vacation, who takes over his stuff? How well do your manager and you work together? It could be worth considering to see what aspirations does he have. Perhaps he wants to remain more technical and not get into a role that may deal more with office politics. 

Usually, I'd talk with the PM and see if there is a way to work out some kind of arrangement. Perhaps I work extra hours for this deadline and later on take off some time so that I'm not billing overtime but merely shuffling around hours. Perhaps there is some other kind of favor system that can be set up. While this may be seen as "working for free" there is the side that I could see this as helping a friend in some cases. If my relationship with the PM is close enough, this is a factor in how I'd handle the situation. The key here is to know a couple of the basic rules here about no overtime that impact's the PM budget, get the project done and try to have the best relationship that I can. 

This may be their preferred application system and they'll use this first. This is more of a possibility than anything else. Additionally, there may be numerous applicants for this scenario that may make it less than great. 

First, figure out what is your intention in having this list on LinkedIn. Is this merely to be a group of people that you know or worked with in the past? Is this to be a concentrated group of co-workers that you want to stay in touch and know well? Set up an intention before moving onto the other stuff. There are more than a few possible ones here. In starting a new job, depending on the intent it may or may not be normal. If you are merely collecting names and they're OK with that then you could try to add them as remember there is something to be said for the other person accepting the connection here. On the other hand, for some people, they would rather you worked with them directly for at least a few months before adding them. 

My personal opinion would be yes it is ethical. There are a few parts to consider for what skills may be refined in posting answers to questions: 

I'd likely think there are more than a few hurdles that I'd be sure of getting past. While language can be an issue, I'd likely put it as a second or third-level barrier here where the easiest way around it is to find people that speak whatever native tongue you do have that work in IT. Overall, I'd consider it an interesting idea to explore further. In a way, I could see this working out well or going disastrously though in either case it is worth knowing what barriers you'd face in trying to get something somewhere. 

Consider what do you want to have happen and what kinds of suggestions could you make after telling this story to your current manager. I see 3 likely options: 

The one year isn't going to count as a year. It could count as a partial if there are aspects of your experience that would translate into a new position. For example, what source control, bug tracking, software development methodology, project management methodology, testing, and other tools did you use? Those you do have experience which may be worth something. 

Depending on how you present this, I could see this going well or quite badly. Consider the question of how can you vouch that when the PC is locked he isn't at meetings with other clients? How are you to know that this project is his sole responsibility in the company? Do you know whether or not you are being groomed to step into a bigger role down the road? In a sense, I can see where you have frustration though I'd argue be careful as chances are your boss may have a different perspective here. Are you out to tell your boss, "Hey, Bob isn't pulling his weight! Fix this, now!"? If so, that would likely not go over so great while at the same time, if you are too subtle your boss may not even understand your problem here. 

I'd likely suggest having weekly 1 on 1 meetings with the superiors rather than a team wide meeting to determine expectations. This is different than a daily Scrum where each side risks embarrassment as if it seems like someone isn't clear about what is happening this doesn't get picked up. 

No, I'd argue whether or not you suggest improvements isn't an indicator one way or another. Someone may enjoy working at a company and not make suggestions yet get experience to put themselves into the next level while in other cases someone may offer lots of suggestions and be what makes them get promoted that they can see issues and should be given more responsibility. 

Depending on the purpose of the e-mail, yes and no. If the e-mail from the recruiter was for specific positions, those may well be unavailable. At the same time, it may be worth apologizing for not getting back sooner and trying to mend some fences along with sending an updated resume that you now have. While you may get some people that are ticked that you took so long to reply, there are some recruiters that may be OK with reconnecting at this point. The key point is to be prepared to stay on top of this and not have it become a pattern that you become known as the person that takes a month to respond to an e-mail. 

While not having a scheduled time means that you can't be late, there is the potential for there to be a wait in some cases if there is a rush of people all coming at the same time. Around here there a couple of different situations that come to mind like this. Medical appointments can be scheduled in some places and others will take walk-ins so that the latter can end up waiting until a doctor is available. The other case where I see this is for salons where some people can have appointments and other people will be walk-ins. Depending on the size of the company, the HR representatives may or may not be possible. The boss would be quite likely unless it is a large company where senior developers would be the ones doing the hiring decision. 

This is rather hard to answer without a lot more details. For example, if the company just got acquired then there could be mass layoffs and thus your offer could go bye bye as part of how the deal is structured. There could be hiring freezes or other stuff that may be going on that since you don't specify a field or the kinds of companies here it is hard to answer. For example, here in Calgary, Alberta there are lots of layoffs from the oil and gas companies where if your offer was from a big oil company that may be killed. If the company is doing well and all the people involved in your hiring are working their regular hours fine then this should be resolved soon. However, if someone got sick or went on vacation it may take some time. 

Take a look if there are any Code Camps in your area where developers will get together and build things during the camp that could be quite illuminating. There may also be user groups or Meetups where developers could gather that may be useful to socialize with other developers to get a better feel for them and try to make generalizations to some degree, though one does have to be careful about dependence on generalities that aren't universally applicable. 

Part of the organization's brand may be for people to look alike and thus the uniform does achieve this result. For example, some schools will have students all wear the same uniform. Now, there may be a lot of school days where there aren't visitors yet children are still expected to maintain a certain image as part of how a school operates. At least that would be how I'd look at it for an understanding. 

The grace days is a tricky one as you're asking for more time yet it'll still be rather limited. This is a rather odd catch-22 in a sense that I'm not sure how you'd convince the employer that you'd still be of great value if you stay for another week or two. While you can ask for a recommendation letter, this can go a few ways. He may ask that you write the letter and he simply signs it. He may turn you down. There are a few unknowns here though I would consider asking him to be a reference as well as getting the recommendation letter. You could ask for other opportunities that depending on how well he knows you, he may or may not pass along your information. Again, it is worth asking but understand that there are lots of different possible results here as it could be that he doesn't have many contacts where there are openings for you. The pioneers can sometimes be the loose cannons as they discover new fields and go into uncharted territory. If you require a work permit to work in the country legally, this could really be a challenge to overcome in some places since different countries may have different policies on how to handle foreign workers.
