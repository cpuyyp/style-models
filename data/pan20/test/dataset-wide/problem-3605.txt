This question requires a general answer since the two types of training, as they are, can have many variations in training parameters. By doing circuit training you can complete the training session in a shorter time while maintaining the intensity: by working out another muscle group while the first one rests you effectively shorten the time spent working out. Shortening the time of a training session leads to lower levels of cortisol post-exercise, which shortens the recovery time between sessions. Circuit training puts a greater total stress on the body (partly due to shorter rest periods, but even with equally long rest periods) since more muscles are in a fatigued state at the same time. This can possibly contribute to the stimulation of anabolic hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone. Doing complete sets allows for a more complete recovery between sets of the worked out muscle, as well as lowers total body fatigue (build up of lactate etc. in the blood) compared to circuit training. This allows for higher power outputs during lifting, and as such greater gains in strength. As a sprinter, focusing on pure strength without hypertrophy, I only employ complete sets. However, if striving for hypertrophy, or strength endurance, then circuit training can be of more value. Advantages of complete sets 

Cellular oedema would reverse rather quickly after exercise. As far as pump goes, there is one simple explanation, and one complicated one. Cellular oedema due to an influx of Na and H2O probably contribute, but not as much. The simple one is that while exercising, there is local hypoxia and hypertension. This causes the vascular resistance to decrease, due to vasodilatory substances such as NO, leading to vascular congestion. After exercising, there is an overshoot of production of vasodilatory substances due to which the pump doesn't go away immideately. The complicated one I can't really go into depth about, because there are many factors involved. But generally, during and after exercise there is an increased influx of nutrients, such as glucose/glycogen, amino acids etc. (also some electrolytes as you mentioned). There are also some waste products still present. All of those substances by themselves have an osmotic pressure (like sodium) which makes water enter the cells (not to the point of bursting though). That is the reason why creatine supplementation makes muscles larger (engorge with water); despite not increasing sodium, it goes into the muscles and the increased number of molecules inside the cells draws in water. So to sum up, I personally think that the vasogenic effects are the main actors in "pump". More so than the osmotic due to how pump behaves (how long it lasts and why it occurs). It is hard to find anything on the topic because it is extremely hard to study. The vasogenic and osmotic effects go hand in hand after training. We can't really test their individual effects in humans on particular muscles. From what i've heard and read, people who use NO supplements get an increased pump that lasts longer, speaking in favor of blood engorgement being the cause. But people who use creatine get a similar effect, speaking in favor of an osmotic effect and water engorgement. Personally I see this question as a mere curiosity. I'm still to think of anything we could use the knowledge about "pump" for. Mostly because it is a byproduct of training (that is, the "pump" is not what causes sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar hypertrophy in the long run. However, it could be an actor in the acute phase, which initiates the anabolism that occurs after). If anyone can think of any way we could use the knowledge about the etiology of "pump" for (assuming it has a benefitial effect in training, other than the psychological one when you look in the mirror), please write it in the comments :) 

Exercising after eating is safe. The other answers here are based on personal opinions. When you eat, the process of digestion is aided by the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest). When you exercise your sympathetic nervous system releases adrenaline, which inhibits the peristaltis in your gut. This in terms makes the food move more slowly through your intestines and causes indigestion. Some of the effects of this are heartburn, bloating and diarrhea. However, this is very individual, as it depends on the ratio of activation of your sympathetic versus your parasympathetic nervous system when exercising. Some people can eat right before and not feel anything, while others need at least 2h before practice. Just doing pull ups will not get your adrenaline pumping as much as doing whole body training such as sprinting or doing contact sports. Try doing pull ups after your meal and see how you feel. Purely medically there are no dangers of doing pull ups after eating. 

The central idea of explosive training is that is utilizes the anaerobic alactic energy system. This energy system has enough ATP for about 7s of sustained high intensity exercise. This is the system that the fast-twitch muscle fibers use. After 7s, there is not enough ATP for sustaining contraction and the muscle switches to the anaerobic glycolytic (less capable of generating force, and produces lactic acid which inhibits contraction). To answer your question there are three aspects that have to be taken into consideration 1) Duration of contraction - The contraction should not last longer than 7-10s. That means that you would do about 9-10 jump squats in a set, about 7-8 chin ups etc.; you are constrained by a time limit, not a number of reps. 2) Force of contraction - The force of the contraction has to be as high as possible. The best way to achieve this is to increase the weight which you exercise with. However, since you are doing bodyweight exercises only, the execution is crucial for adaptation to occur, since after a couple of weeks your muscles will get used to the training stimulus and no further increase in strength, hypertrophy or explosiveness will occus. To activate as many motor units as possible (=a greater part of the muscle) you have to perform the exercise as quickly as possible. I.e. try to do as many reps as possible within those 7-10s. Just make sure you use the proper form; don't cheat your way to a higher rep count. 3) Number of sets - When training the anaerobic alactic system you do not have the same adaptation mechanisms as during hypertrophy training. When aiming for bulk, you do 3 sets of 8-12 reps at 4 seconds per rep, totalling a set time of about 40s. However, when training for explosiveness, you do not produce lactic acid, and the muscle does not fatigue as easily, so you have to perform more sets than for hypertrophy. - Firstly because of the lower volume of training; the total number of reps per training is much lower when doing explosive training than for hypertrophy. - Secondly, the muscle hardly fatigues, so theoretically you could perform as many sets as 15-20 or more. In my training (I am a professional sprinter), I usually keep doing sets until my form deteriorates, which usually occurs somewhere around the 7th-9th set depending on the muscle. So to answer your second question directly, you do not cross over to endurance training by increasing set number, because you actually rest between the sets. You increase the endurance aspect of training by increasing the number of reps within each set. Just make sure you have about 5min of rest between sets so that your ATP has time to replenish. 

To answer your last question. Yes, it can be trained. Although not to that extent. To sum up the research, it seems that the higher the tension in your muscles and tendons when you exercise, the more the function of the GTO is inhibited, and the more the muscle spindle responds to stretching. Weight training has this effect. Power lifting and sprinting more so. Plyometrics seems to be most effective at it. 

There are several reasons for your tremor, ranging from Parkinson's (for which you, according to incidence statistics, are too young) and cerebellar ataxia (unlikely without other neurological deficits or a previous history of trauma) to benign muscular apraxia. The only way to know would be to perform a physical examination. You say that your whole body shakes, and that is, in its literal sense, a neurological symptom. However, seeing that you just started working out after a long period without physical activity, the most likely etiology is that you have poor inter- and intramuscular coordination. Basically, your brain and muscles aren't used to performing those movements smoothly and efficiently. This always happens during the initial phases of training, even for experienced athletes after years of training with a short detraining period, but also when doing a new exercise. In case your tremor does not subside within the next 5-6 training sessions, or at least improve, then it is likely something else. If it does, then you have nothing to worry about, there is no need to control it, and it will go away on its own once you get more used to performing those movements. 

You say that you see it when sitting on a chair. Most probably, what you are seeing is skin. And maybe several layers of subcutaneous fat. That is normal, even for skinny people. Everyone has excess skin on the stomach. That allows the body freedom of movement so you can extend your spine. If you were to have less, your skin would stretch and not allow you to extend backwards. Those recordings that you do on yourself are not entirely reliable, especially if you perform only one measurement. However, assuming you do have 8% BF, then what you are seeing when flexed at the hip is actually mostly skin. 

I had the same thought when I watched some documentary about that. Unfortunately I couldn't find any references either. What I did, though, was to start studying medicine, and things started to make sense. When you exercise there is an acute increase in heart rate. That increase is short lasting, and depends on your oxygen debt (thats what exercise physiologists call it) during and after training. Once that oxygen debt has been repaid, there is a slight increase above baseline as the body is in a higher metabolic state (anabolism to repair and to build muscles, organelles and the like). When you compare the total number of increased heart beats during exercise and after to the lower number of heart beats throughout the day and night, due to increased fitness and oxygen utilization efficiency, the result is a lower total number of heart beats. I do not have any studies to back this up. However, you can read about these phenomena in exercise physiology books. For one side of the coin you can compare heart rates of athlete populations and sedentary individuals (I did just that; kind of like a meta-study), and for the other you can yourself measure (with a pulsmeter) your total increased heart beats, from baseline, for a training session, and you will see that it adds up. Furthermore, the last 6 years I have been recording my heart rate several times per day, together with every kilogram I've lifted in the gym, and every meter I have run or sprinted. Having gone through periods of both maximal fitness and injury periods with total rest, I have found the total number of heart beats to indeed be lower the more you exercise (unless you become overtrained as I was for about 3 months). This could be a good study to publish. However, since athletes differ widely in their physiologies and types of training, a case study wouldn't be as good as a prospective study with at least 10 participants. 

Actually, height is largely genetic. However, nutrition is what impacts it from en environmental standpoint, and not exercise (it has a slight effect, assuming you are not a professional powerlifter, marathon runner or the like). So no, you cannot increase height by doing certain exercises. The notion that training basketball or volleyball makes you taller is wrong; professional basketball players are an artificially selected population, that is, if you are tall, you are more likely to play ball. For example, doing heavy weight training in adolescence can negatively impact growth as nutrients are directed away from bone growth and toward muscle growth and maintenance. Chronic diseases affect growth similarly, by affecting nutrient supply. Your height is determined as your parents' average +7cm for males, -7cm for females. There is some wiggle-room; in case your "genetic potential" is 170cm, then your resulting height will be a couple of cm's above or below, depending on external factors. In case you have a large supply of calories, and all necessary nutrients, then you can reach your maximal genetic potential. 

I would say that it does have the effect of lowering life span. My main argument for that hypothesis is the fact that calorie restriction has been scientifically shown to increase the life span. What happens when you are on calorie restriction? 

There is a very important aspect of your question. To answer it we must consider what happens during exercise. When exercising a muscle, its energy supplies become depleted, it becomes fatigued and creates by-products such as lactic acid which go into the blood stream. All of these changes stress the body, in response to which the adrenal glands produce cortisol. Despite common belief, and the fact that it is a steroid, cortisol is a catabolic hormone; it suppresses protein metabolism. How does this then relate to rest periods? When doing an upper body/lower body regime on alternating days, each individual muscle will get a full 48h of rest. Which is adequate for regenerating the energy supplies within the muscle. However, the body will still be in stress from the previous workout, with increased blood levels of cortisol. By maintaining this sort of protocol, you eventually risk becoming overtrained (depending on training intensity and volume). However, when you have a full day rest between two trainings, the levels of cortisol and other stress hormones falls, the body regenerates and the risk of overtraining reduces significantly (if this holistic approach is followed regularly). For an optimal training schedule, you must weigh the benefits of a high frequency of trainings (such as increased strength, endurance and hypertrophy) with the risks (overtraining, fatigue and injury) in order to find an optimal balance between resting and exercising. Also, as some other answers to this question have stated, there is localized fatigue in stabilizing muscles, such as the core, with any type of exercise. So a full day rest is often needed. The best way to utilize this knowledge is to do block periodization. That is, to exercise on alternate days for a couple of days, say 3-4, and then to take a whole day off. This way you stress the body in waves, but also allow it to adapt and regenerate on the resting days. 

The answer by LarissaGodzilla is very good. But I would like to add one thing that you can do that actually increases your vascularity, independent of genetics (which nevertheless influences the extent of this effect). Doing interval training, such as HIIT, increases vasogenic factors into the blood, which subsequently causes blood vessels to proliferate. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8790589, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258658) When doing long distance running, this effect is somewhat lower, and occurs more centrally in the muscle (in order to supply more blood and oxygen for energy). However, in intensive interval training you activate the muscles forcefully, which presses the blood from the muscles to the superficial veins. That increases the pressure inside them, which acts as a stimulant for vasodilation and vasogenesis in itself. But it also increases the delivery of vasogenic factors specifically to those veins, which leads to further vasogenesis. I would also like to add an explanation to LarissaGodzillas argument on temperature. It is indeed the temperature that causes the vasodilation. That is why it is bad for people with varicose veins to shower with hot water. When the temperature is increased, the body responds by vasodilation. This moves the blood superficially, so it can emit more heat and as such prevent overheating.
