One thing that should be clarified is that it is a fact that Saddam Hussein's Iraq had WMD's at one point. We know this, because he used them on his own Kurdish population in 1988. At issue in 2003 was if he still had them, or if he'd dismantled them all, and his production program, as he'd agreed to do at the end of the first Gulf War. Now, it would perhaps be easier to list who didn't think Iraq still had WMD's in 2003. One name on that (much shorter) list would be Hans Blix, the guy in charge of weapons inspections for Iraq. In other words, the person most in a position to make that assessment. He made a statement before the war started that he thought they pretty much had all of Iraq's WMD source material accounted for. This was much derided by the right wing in America at the time. A large part of the problem was that Iraq acted like they had WMD's. They were constantly refusing inspectors access to certian sites, then waiting a while and letting them back in. They were refusing access to scientists. They were just not cooperating in a way that didn't make much sense unless they had something to hide. The explanation I've heard for this since was that Hussein felt like the weapons were a deterrent to Iran, and wanted Iran to believe he still had them. Sadly for him (and many others), he ended up decieving the wrong people. 

The currently accepted answer is a good one*. However, it leaves out one very important beef that the Republican Establishment had with Reagan: racial politics. The Liberal wing of the Republican party was actually instrumental during the 50's and 60's in getting Civil Rights legislation passed. There was essentially a coalition of moderate Democrats and Liberal Republicans that pushed through things like the Voting Rights Act. There was a large block of very conservative southern Democrats who were dead set against the entire Civil Rights package, and for every such bill there was an attempted filibuster in the Senate. Senator Sam Earvin (D-NC) made what became a typical argument that it violated the principle of States' Rights. In other words, States should have the right to oppress a certain class of their citizens if they so choose without interference from the Federal Government. This is how the "States' Rights" argument in that era became a proxy argument for the upholding of Jim Crow. These bills eventually passed, of course, but the Southern conservative Democrats did not forget, and largely started to abandon the Democratic party in national elections. At first this took the form of third parties, exemplified by the States' Rights Democratic Party, which won 4 southern states in 1948. This large electoral block of voters was ripe for the picking, if only the Republicans could reconcile themselves with the racist policy positions it would require to do so. The short story here is that the Liberal and Moderate Republican establishment was not up for that, but the Conservative wing was. Thus was born The Southern Strategy. The name was first used with the Conservative-friendly Nixon administration, but the strategy itself was first employed by Ronald Reagan's mentor and idol, Barry Goldwater. He ran against the Civil Rights Act, using (as per form) the coded "States' Rights" argument. Goldwater lost badly, but he still won his home state, and swept the entire deep South. As I said, Reagan was a supporter and admirer of Goldwater, and ran in 1976 and 1980 as the standard-bearer for the "Goldwater" faction of the party. Being from California he didn't have a huge track record on the racial issue though. So he made sure to shore up his cred in that area by actually opening his campaign by going all the way to Philidelphia, Mississippi, the site of the Mississippi Burning murders, and delivering a speech on "State's Rights". This was obviously a bit of political gymnastics for the party that had initially freed the slaves, and created and nurtured the Constitutional Amendments that the various Civil Rights acts were trying to enforce. It also meant a loss of black support for the foreseeable future, as well as the entire liberal faction of the party. However, its really tough to argue against success, and the new party alignment certainly brought that. * - I upvoted 

Given that both are thought to date back to the 4th or 5th centuries BCE, and the poetic verse structure strongly implies a long history as an oral tradition before it was committed to writing, this would be very much like asking how true the Iliad is. The purpose of epic poems is not really to act as a historical document like we think of them today. The purpose is to tell a good story, and perhaps also teach a few lessons. For instance, it is common that they include a hero that is meant to "embody the values of the civilization". 

IOW, we are talking my proverbial random people off the street here, not people who actually understand physics. Then there's this (quoting Goddard): 

Forbes is owned by multi-milionarie Republican (demi-Libertarian) Steve Forbes. It is not a friend of Democrats in general, and Liberal Democratic icons like Ted Kennedy in particular. Still, it was restrained and friendly compared to some other right-wing sources. The letter the article refers to did appear to happen. The hostile analysis you quoted though, is just that. There's nothing in the letter itself about a "quid pro quo", and no request for help in the upcomming election. If anything, Kennedy seems to be saying he'd have credibility on the subject precisely because he wasn't running in the upcomming cycle ('84). Another perfectly reasonable cynical political interpretation of this letter is that Kennedy felt that anti-Soviet feeling strengthened Reagan's hand, so anything he could do to help promote understanding and cool tensions would therby weaken Reagan. Here's what Kennedy's wiki page says about this incident: 

Most of the government changes in the wake of the French Revolution were at the point of Napolean's (very effective) sword, and were ultimately undone by the sword as well. Where you get dramatic internal-driven change wasn't really after the first French Revolution, but the Second (1848). This touched off a series of Liberal revolutions which today we might call a "European Spring", although over 50 countries all over the world were affected. England itself escaped, probably because it already had a relatively Liberal government. Ditto for the Netherlands. Russia, I'm guessing was not quite ready. Their definitive revoultion had to wait for 50 years. The Iberian penenisula also escaped relatively unscathed, chiefly because they'd just finished similar wars a couple of decades earlier. One of the lessons a lot of leaders (Bismark prominently excepted) took from 1848 was that having a relatively liberal government, like England and the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal, actually appeared to make your country more stable in such times. This caused a lot of "Liberal" reform to be voluntarily instituted over the next few decades. 

Once slavery had been ended, and the Republican Party gave up on trying to push civil rights in the defeated South (in the wake of the election of 1876), that only left the "pro-business" platform of the party standing. Here, according to wikipedia, is what that looked like in the late 19th Century: 

There's a fair debate that the release of some dispatches by Wikileaks was responsible for the ouster of Ben Ali in Tunisia. I have to say "partially responsible" though. Obviously the Tunisian people did most of the heavy lifting. But it is said that one of the things that enabled them to even think about it was the revelation that the US, far from supporting the guy, actually looked upon him as somewhat of a corrupt buffoon. 

The UK Parliament at the time was run by the Tories, the Whigs being the opposition party. This meant that the war was essentially the Tories' baby. Meanwhile the opposition Whigs being were inclined to blame the entire situation on Tory misjudgment and incompetence. If the voting public came to believe the Whigs' view, then the Whigs might get to take over Parliament again. The Tories' theory for how they would win the war was essentially that when the going got tough enough, the colonists would give up their silly grudge and come crawling back. So to them, a turncoat American general represented one small step for their strategy on the path to victory. That not being a productive path for the opposition party, they'd be more inclined to treat him as a simple foreign traitor. So in effect, by going back to England Arnold made himself into a political football. 

In a parlimentary system that does not use first-past-the-post voting, it is not at all uncommon for no one party to have an outright majority. So somebody becoming head of the government with barely a third of the vote (as Hitler did) is quite doable. For example, the current head of the Isreali government heads a party that only polled 21% in their last election (and came in second). Whenever Greece manages to finally get a government, it will probably be minority led in some similar fashion as well. Hitler just used this parlimentary effect. At the end of the Weimar Republic's last free elections, the Nazis and the Communists did so well that there was basically no way of forming a government without one of them. Not a great choice there from the Republic's perspective, as both parties were against the very idea of the Weimar Republic. But the Nazis were deemed the lesser of the two evils. (Its an interesting speculation if the Communists would have tried the same thing if they'd been tapped instead. I'm guessing yes). Hitler's price for being part of any Coalition was to be named Chancelor. That was deemed a relatively powerless position, so they agreed. But then he managed to scare President Hindenburg into essentially declaring Martial Law, disempowering the Reichstag (parliment), and that was all the opening Hitler needed. So yes, he did achieve office initially democratically. However, he never had the (free) electoral support of a majority. 

This youtube clip contains a dramatization of this from the 1981 Ghandi biopic that is worth seeing (although it is far too antiseptic). That is what is meant by "do or die". Walking willingly into harm's way rather than submit. 

Most ink used was black (just like with everyone else's writing). According to archeologist Michael Coe, this was most likely derived from soot "scraped off the bottom of their cooking pots". In the four surviving complete codices we have, they also used a lot of red, which appeared to be hematite(rust)-based. There supposedly aren't a lot of known good sources in the Mayan areas*, so nobody is sure exactly where they got it from. There were also a few pages floating around using green and blue. The latter I find particularly intriguing, as the blue typically used in the west was expensive (to the point where many argue the concept of that color simply did not exist until recently), while the Codex piece I've seen with blue used it as a background color. Its a slightly different blue ("maya blue"), that is derived from a native plant mixed with a specific clay. * - We know they had some small access to Iron, as they were also known to use it to make mirrors.
