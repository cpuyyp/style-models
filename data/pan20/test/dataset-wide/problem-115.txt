If the black hole is stationary the net change to your speed is 0. That is to say, once you are as far away from the black hole as you started, you'll be moving at the same speed you started at. We use planets that are already travelling in the general direction we want to go. See Gravity_assist. During a close pass you could certainly pick up some extraordinary speed before shedding it as you move away from the center of gravity. EDIT: Loren Pechtel pointed out the Oberth Effect, which I don't believe is usually what is meant by a "gravity slingshot", but may certainly be relevant to the story idea. Note, this just means your have a greater exit speed from the gravity well than by using the same thrust in empty space. Your maximum speed will still occur around the closest point of your pass by the black hole. As for what happens when you get close, well first there's frequently a lot of matter in the accretion disk that is getting sucked in pretty fast. If you get close the gravity on the side of you that is closer to the black hole is actually greater than the gravity on the opposite side, resulting in a stretching force. This force is enough to tear anything apart before you even reach the event horizon. In other words it's never the event horizon that really kills you. See Spaghettification 

Grand Absorber needs fuel: Grand Absorber can absorb another item to acquire new effects OR you can use it to gain more magical fuel to power the magic the Grand Absorber already has access to Grand Absorber has limited versatility: Grand Absorber can only remember a few spells or one spell at a time or only the most few recent spells absorbed or Grand Absorber memory is bounded by tiers of magic it is storing. Grand Absorber time limit: After your Grand Absorber has eaten a new item, there is only a limited number of time (you can spam a spell 24/7 for a month for example) or the spell can only be cast X number of times Grand Absorber is intelligent and greedy: Grand Absorber isn't too fond of freely handing you a crap ton of magic that it has absorbed. You're going to need to pay a price (this could be anything from your memories/gold/lives of loved ones) as tribute if you wish to use the magic Grand Absorber is TYPE limited: Your Grand Absorber can only take in spells of certain schools at a time. For instance your Grand Absorber can only eat magical items that are part of the evocation school. If a user wants to store a new type of magic (like swapping to abjuration/transmutation), the user has to drop all the spells the Grand Absorber uses. 

Although, Pliny the elder wrote that it may give you magic powers, but that has yet to be determined 

Imagine you are dragging a giant rubber tractor tire across the ground by reeling it in with a steel cable at a rate of 2 to 5 centimeters per year. It wouldn't really be a continuous movement. When the tension in the cable got stronger than the static friction of the tire against the ground it would scoot a tiny distance, maybe a few millimeters, across the ground and rest again. That's essentially what an earthquake is scaled down. Now imagine an angry ant pounds on the cable with it's tiny fists. That's what your conventional explosives are doing. The forces involved in a tectonic plate moving are enormous even when compared with nuclear weapons. The best you can do is trigger that tire to move again just a little bit earlier. In doing so you may actually be lessening the severity of the earthquake by releasing that tension earlier before it builds up even more. There's not much information on the possibility of triggering earthquakes with conventional explosives, but luckily nuclear munitions are often measured in their equivalent TNT tonnage, and people have worried about the potential to trigger earthquakes with nuclear testing in the past. "The elastic strains induced in the epicentral region by the passage of the seismic wavefield generated by the largest of the nuclear tests, the May 11 Indian test with an estimated yield of 40 kilotons, is about 100 times smaller than the strains induced by the Earth's semi-diurnal (12 hour) tides that are produced by the gravitational fields of the Moon and the Sun." - $URL$ Note the nuclear tests are not conducted at the fault line, but relatively distant. 

If you read Soviet literature, e.g., science fiction from the decade following Stalin's death, it was full of hope. And it was genuine hope, not communist party propaganda. These hopes were eventually killed, suffocated perhaps is the better word, by the stagnation of the Brezhnev era. Instead of the stagnation, allow economic reforms in the 1960s in both the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Allow Hungary to go through with its 1968 New Economic Mechanism unimpeded. Reintroduce and strengthen the reforms of Lenin's New Economic Policy and insist on the satellite states following suit. Allow private enterprise, foreign investment, market forces and the free flow of capital. Tear down the stupid Berlin wall (or better yet, don't build it in the first place); a good economic policy is a much better way to retain manpower. In short, do what China did under Deng, and what the Soviet Union dared not do under Brezhnev, for fear of losing direct and complete control over the economy of the totalitarian state. With the human and economic resources available to the Soviet Union, it could have become an economic powerhouse by the 1980s, even as it maintained a one-party state and totalitarian control over the political sector. China's example shows as much. And the occasional political revolt could be put down with ease (see Tiananmen Square) when the people, by and large, are satisfied with your governance. The Prague Spring of 1968 might not even have happened. Solidarity would have been just a blip on the radar, if it even formed in the first place. Oh, and don't let Reagan bait you with Star Wars into a spending contest that you are destined to lose. And, of course it goes without saying, don't get suckered into the Afghanistan adventure. Don't waste the space program's resources on a shuttle just for prestige, when it was glaringly obvious already that the universal, economical "Space Transportation System" was anything but. But you know what... even with these rather bad political mistakes, the Soviet Union could have remained intact and more powerful than ever, if its septuagenarian leadership only had the courage to allow its economy to flourish. 

With a long enough and strong enough rope, and enough animals, certainly you could pull any load. I think the real challenge would be getting a wagon made of stone that will not break. To simplify things I'm going to assume that modern structural concrete is similar to a best case scenario for something carved out of solid stone, because they have similar properties and it's harder to find data about the structural strength of stone. It is brittle and handles compression forces well, but not other forces. Concrete's breaking length, the maximum length of a vertical column of the material suspended from the top, is about 1/25th that of oak. Structural engineering has since antiquity used quite a lot of structural features, like arches, to distribute forces in a way that stone in structures primarily endure large compression forces. This might be harder to achieve in a wagon, and at the very least might merit some redesigning. Additionally it's brittleness would be less able to handle the shocks of a moving vehicle without fracturing. $URL$ Some redesigning ideas: 

I don't believe you would really have to do anything. Imagine sending a book on modern computer engineering back in time a hundred years. I would guess they would be able to develop semiconductors sooner and maybe, just maybe, iterate a bit faster than Moore's law, but you wouldn't see the internet appear mere years after the knowledge in that book was disseminated. You always need infrastructure. You need the tools to make better tools to make still better tools.
