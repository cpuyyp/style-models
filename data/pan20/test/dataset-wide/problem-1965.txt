Not sure it would help to handle it any differently. I'd like to think your interviewer picked up on the problems the two of you were having with this conversation and may take that into consideration in his evaluation. Maybe they should consider sending questions to you in writing? That would have helped. This stage of the interview could be a formality. As a former special education teacher, I was exposed to several childern with speech difficulties. Over time, I was able to understand them pretty clearly. I wouldn't be too concerned working for a company with team members who may not be fluent in my language. Unfortunately, as a job candidate you don't get to spend as much time with this person as his/her coworkers, so they may not be aware of the problem. Whether you get an offer or not, I would make the company aware of the situation. This does limit their pool of potential candidates, but they may not care. 

Identify a portion of the meeting for the manager and then make it shorter. Focus on what is important to the manager. Cover broad areas. Don't be technical unless the manager is technical. Avoid the details. Schedule any other meeting for those who need more details and/or something more technical. You're trying to sell the manager on this system. Find out why he/she needs it. If the manager wants absolutely nothing to do with any new system, you could be in trouble, but you're better off with shorter and to the point presentations instead of long and boring sessions. 

You can only get the top level in your performance review if you and the reviewer both agree/understand what it takes. It helps if this can be objectively measured. Hopefully, you're getting feedback along the way. Even for an annual review process, wouldn't it be nice to have known the first 3 months you were only getting a 4. Or maybe you were getting a 5, but slipped the next quarter. The review process is a formality and a game. The mysterious bonus is dangled in front of you for 12 months in hopes you'll continue to strive and at best, not leave the company until that period is over. You could have been the victim of No one gets all 5's - one can only imagine the ridiculous logic applied here. Are the goals set so high? Nobody is perfect? If you get a perfect score, there's incentive for you to do better or you'll always expect it. Can't remember where I heard it, but if you want to increase the effectiveness of the annual review process, do it every 2 years. Amazing how prevelent this absolute waste of time is (And we want governments to act more like businesses?). 

If you're going to share a room with someone, you better negotiate. Instead of looking at the situation like you have to be a subordinate, think of it as she owes you a favor on a daily-basis. Is there anything in life you want? She gets the window, but has to bring you tea every morning. How about buying you lunch once a week? Getting you a better chair or a lamp for the dark corner. She wants the window, what's in it for you? Edit: Feel free to ask for anything you want. I only gave an example. Getting something in the future isn't really the key point here. Just ask for something in return, so you don't feel like you always have to give in. 

I think the biggest issue here is this is "always" the way it is done. For whatever reason, the analyst feels a need to stretch everyone's skills. There's nothing wrong with that. Avoid getting into what is the better solution. You've already made the simple solution argument, but you're losing. Instead, ask that you be allowed to come up with some of you own solutions as part of the learning process. I'm sure he can remember how frustrating it is to not be allowed to experiment and come up with your own designs. If you don't get it into some level of production, you're never going to learn if this truly works and is easy to maintain. Another part of your training argument is to learn when and where to apply a more complex solution. Of course you need to learn how to code the more complex solution in order to compare and contrast with a more simple one. He may not truly be concerned about everyone's learning, but is just promoting his capabilities with sophisticated designs. If that is the case, it is going to be difficult to debate someone with an ulterior motive especially when they have more authority. 

Why don't you just ask? You've interviewing candidates and going through salary negotiations. If they want a higher salary, ask them what they would accept instead. It could be things like flexible work scheduling, training/mentorship (like you're already offering), other benefits that may be perceived in larger financial amounts than what the company pays for (e.g. company gets group discount on club membership, insurance, etc..). Each candidate can be different, so you may not be successful offering them all the same thing. 

Eventually, you'll learn how things work at a particular company and can determine if there's anything to be gained. 

Change your thinking for your own sanity. Everybody works for someone else and delivers more than they get paid. Your job is to help your boss get his/her bonus. Otherwise, why do they need you? If you make a million dollars for your company, don't expect them to give you a million dollars. I think it is counter-productive for a boss to do this without you getting any bonus because there is the risk you leaving or worse not performing in the future and being a waste of a salary. Everyone wants to get credit and be recognized and appreciated, but it won't happen with every single thing you do. If you want to sign your name to all of your work, become an artist or work on a movie. The key is for your boss to do what is necessary to keep you productive. The company isn't going to compensate you if you don't have anything to offer. The boss who is doing well and recognized in the company (and gets a big bonus) is in a much better position to help her team. Bad bosses aren't able to get you a raise because no one values their opinion. If you don't get what you think you deserve, let them know. Unfortunately, you may have to start looking for another job. 

Based on many questions about a potential employee disclosing their salary history, I'm under the impression this is common and a little undesirable. Would this practice be a little more equitable if the employer disclosed salaries of past employees at this or a similar positions within the company? It could be considered a privacy issue (Especially if only one person ever held that position.), but my guess most employers don't feel obligated. Does it seem fair to ask what were the previous or current salaries for a similar job when asked to disclose salary histories during the interview process? 

I've worked in several different industries and there were few intentional requests to "silo" our data. Even a payroll system gets linked to other benefits and healthcare tracking. Any by that I mean having no need to move data in or out of a particular data store. This is different than security which should allow the access and flow of data "as needed" and rarely needs complete isolation. It's a matter of degree. Silos get created because different parts of an organization need apps for specific tasks. During the growth of the business, many of these come in at different stages. A simple accounting system is put into place. The one person doing any sales has all the clients in his or her contact manager. Different industries have apps specific for their needs (building houses, managing stocks, insurance policies, scheduling deliveries) and then there are off-shoots like, inventory, project management, payroll, document management. The need to integrate or connect the silos doesn't happen right away. Few companies will take the time and cost to prepare for this early on. Sort of a premature optimization. If you close one sale a week, it's not that hard for everybody to manually enter that in their system, but along with the increase in volume, comes other complexities. You need to avoid duplication. How do you cross-reference the same customer when no one even managed to spell the name the same? A silo can be the most cost-effective choice to offer the security you need, but in my experience, they usually occur because of a lack of need, planning, technical expertise which all boils down to time and money. 

Hopefully they're applying the same evaluation methods to the other employee and he's not doing as well. You don't know, he may be on the way out. If they're not rewarding/recognizing the good employees, they're probably not weeding out the bad ones. 

What appears professional and procedural on the surface of the actual business, isn't what happens in all of the other departments that are really not part of the financial business part of the company. HR is one of them. Maybe when they recruit college grads they can follow all the nice protocols because they know all the students are looking for jobs and some universities may have over-site on the process, but this recruiter is trying to poach you from another firm. They're probably a little more sneaky about it. They'll try to get you to put your guard down by telling you there's no reason to follow the rules. It's dog eat eat dog. Unfortunately, they're rewarded for hiring people and they will be willing to be a little less professional if they feel it is necessary.
