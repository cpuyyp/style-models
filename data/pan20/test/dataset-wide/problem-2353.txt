Looks like scaling to me, the way scaling is dealt with when forging depends a bit on the composition of the metal and the heat that is used (lots of heat=lots of scaling, you can eat away a lot of the material just in scaling if you work too hot). Normally after you acquire practice working scaling wont be a problem. These days "hand made" forging doesn't necessarily mean a guy hammering away on the piece over an anvil. Its usually open die forging: the guy moves the piece from one hydraulic hammer to the other, as each has a different shaped head and the metal can spread at the sides, until the final shape is obtained. That's opposed to the close die forging where there is a die with the final product shape and the metal is formed into it by one single hammer and this one can be all automated. They both are forms of drop forging but the first one often falls into the "hand forged" just because there's a worker moving the piece to shape it. While scaling can be just a surface thing, so it wont matter much and can still be removed by you (and btw, some can be left on purpose as hand made sort of aesthetic reason), what would worry me is what is visible in your first picture, right at the back of the ground edge, forming a sort of C, it seems like the edge of a rather big chip (unless its just the picture that fools the eye). Can be that is somehow fused or a proper crack, its hard to say on the ground side because grinding moves the metal over a bit but it shows the depth of it. Also the darker corner (up and left) on the edge would make me think that they started grinding there and it got too hot while doing the rest. Others might have different opinions on that. 

Use your finger. Equally to using your finger to cover the sun when trying to spot something in the sky you can use the principle to cover the bright spot. You will be closing one eye and putting the finger between your eye and the bright spot to cover it just enough to not bother you I used that system several times both with the sun but also if I had to do a couple of tack welds and someone else was using my welding mask (my face was protected and me mentioning doesn't mean I advocate this system for regular welding). I would also suggest you use a charcloth, besides catching fire easily the general glare from a charcloth is much less than from a white piece of paper. And yes, I lit fires with a magnifying glass but, in those cases, I never felt a particular need to protect my eyes. In your requirements you say it must allow looking at the bright spot. Honestly, unless you are the kid burning ants with the magnifying glass, you don't really need to look right at it. And if you are worried about looking directly at the bright spot then don't consider a mirror, you wouldn't want to reflect the light right in your eyes by some freak accident. 

Heating can help, but you have to be careful, infact an "insert removal tool" is basically a brass bolt as tip of a soldering iron. However if you have a soldering iron with bent needle tip for electronics you will be able to work it only where you need running into the threads, you will clean it but its slow. Dental picks (metal ones) work too if you have them and if you have the patience, it takes time, more than with the soldering iron. What are the shafts made of? If they are carbon whatever chemical you use can also ruin the shaft if it goes on that. BTW acetic acid works well for cleaning epoxy, plain vinegar is enough but best the pickling one that is a tad more concentrated. Use acetone, MEK, or all that stuff only if you are sure it will stay within the threaded part, its much more aggressive than vinegar and it will ruin any plastic or carbon it comes in contact with (some people use it to clean carbon shafts, but it ruins them). There are tools made for cleaning and re-tap the inserts threads, or you can just use a normal tap of the right size from an hardware store , works the same, lasts forever, and since its not "for archery" costs less and will take any tap you will need to retap other parts of your bow if compound etc (or make your own cutting 3 grooves along the side of a metal bolt since it would be just for cleaning out an existing thread and not cutting a new one. The grooves are necessary to collect the waste to be cleaned out or it just gets packed at the end of the thread, obviously clean the burrs off the tap once cut the grooves). From the hardware store you will find 3 kind of taps, you want the "bottoming" ones, that will clean all the way down even on blind inserts Some inserts are sold with burrs, other times some points wont fit properly, so having a tool like that at hand is always useful. Otherwise just take everything apart, if necessary restore to length with a sleeve and rebuild compensating for the extra weight (but must be really messed up to do that). As prevention, beside immediately cleaning with vinegar where needed, you can protect the thread with a nylon bolt (hardware store) coated with vaseline before gluing, glue wont stick to it (you actually can "cast" inserts that way). Remove it when the glue is not fully cured (green) while holding the lip of the insert. If you dont find the nylon threaded bolt, or if you are worried it will get stuck and break inside the insert (in which case a drill bit held in the tap tool to practice a hole in the nylon will give room to the tap for cleaning the rest of the bolt off) just heavily coat the threads of the inserts with vaseline on qtip/toothpick (no vaseline? can use a crayon, grease pencil, lipstick, string wax, shoe polish... basically anything greasy that coats the threads wont let the epoxy stick to it, for the same reasons be careful to not smear it on parts that need to be glued, and that's also why its best to avoid oil) PS: If you want to buy the tool specific for archery be aware that some sold online are pretty much worthless. If you want to be sure the tool works for you, go to your store with the shaft and tell the person at the counter what you want and that you want to be sure it works, they will probably demonstrate it right there and then. Costs more but you are sure to have something that works. 

The sound you are referring to is probably a plaintive call used to attract attention (of a mate or from the little ones to the parents for feeding) it might just be them wanting to be fed. You can find a better explanation with sound samples here: $URL$ 

Amine blush is something you will have to deal only on new repair. In old and exposed repairs the blushing would likely be long gone. Basically amine blush is salts of amine carbonate, they will combine with CO2 and air moisture to form hydrates of amine carbonate. They are a result of the curing process and the hardener is largely responsible of this, in fact you can have hardeners that wont blush and some that will (for example West System 207 vs West System 206) paired with the same resin. It looks like a white-ish smudge and given enough time it becomes sort of powdery. Depending on the formulations you can have epoxies that will blush and some that wont (non-blushing... they all will blush to a certain extent but in some you simply dont have to worry about it, I worked with some brands that left nothing at all, however rinsing cured laminations before recoating becomes an habit when you are used to work with different epoxies) The chemistry itself, shape of the amine and how they relate to different formulations and strength of the final product isn't something you want to care about as what is available to a backyard builder ends falling all within the same performance envelope that pretty much exceeds the requirements of our applications (things would be different if you were to repair an airplane). In the picture you can see a set of test panels with different epoxies, the one in the bottom left shows some bad blushing The problem is that they are surface contamination that will prevent proper adhesion of following coats of resin (to fill the weave of the cloth for example) or varnish/paint coatings. That is dealt with by letting the resin cure then simply washing and scrubbing away the amine (warm water with mild soap and scotchbrite type pads) and rinsing. Wet sanding also removes the amine provided the surface is rinsed well during and after the sanding. Other ways to eliminate them are more typical of industrial processes rather than what one does at home. Dry sanding is not suggested as will end pushing the amine inside the sandpaper scratches making them very difficult to remove even with a wash. Using solvents on resins as cleaners is never a good idea due to the possibility that contaminants are left by the solvents themselves, that the solvent wont eliminate contaminants already present on the surface and that they will reduce the performance properties of the resin. Another method to deal with the amine on several recoatings is to apply the following coats before cure "wet-on-wet", so the the amine will end only on the final layer, and this can include brushing the gelcoat. This is very different from the other kind of wax that shows off in polyester resins. Since this kind of resin has difficulty curing in the presence of air a bit of paraffin wax is dissolved in the resin formulation. This wax rises to the surface during the curing process and forms a thin film that separates the resin from the air allowing it to cure hard. Polyester resins are non air-inhibited (they have wax in) or air-inhibited (they dont have wax). The polyester resins without wax are used for layup schedules that have different layers applied at different times as they wont cure completely (without the wax the air inhibits the curing process) thus permitting chemical bonds with the following layers, they are laminating resins and the final lamination with waxed resin or gelcoat will seal them permitting full cure. The polyester resins with wax instead are used for single laminations, final laminations, or pieces that will need to be sanded (cleaning off the wax then sanding and cleaning allows for mechanical adhesion of following coats). Applying a following coat over uncured resin method (hotcoating) comes from the polyester resins: due to price in the past they were the main resin people worked with and many of the techniques have been ported to epoxies now that they are more affordable, not because the two resins work in the same way but because of work habits and often there are different advantages (i.e. wet-on-wet permits the hotcoating of polyesters where the wax can be pushed up across the layers and still have chemical adhesion and in epoxies permits chemical bonding and saves the time of washing the cured layer but mostly saves the need for sanding) So, for different reasons and different substances, both polyester and epoxy resins need a bit of care when multiple laminations are applied one above the other. You will find that epoxies are a lot easier to work with than polyesters. In practice the problem you are facing is not the amine, which is easily taken care of and patches are laminated in one single shot most of the times. Rather your doubts of possibility of failed adhesion is the fact that you have previous repairs made with who-knows-what. Remember that, waxes and amines aside, while epoxy adheres rather well on polyester resins, polyesters have lousy adhesion on epoxy resin and should not be used on top of it otherwise you risk to have delamination overtime. Commercially you can more or less tell the kind of resin used even looking at the cloth (mat for example is used only with polyesters, its fibres are prepped for that resin), but when you are talking about backyard repairs that could have been made using all sort of material at hand you can never tell, so you will be limited to epoxies as they will stick to almost anything already there. Humidity isnt a big problem for the resin itself, but clear epoxies in applications where you are looking for it to be completely transparent, can fog up if laminated in high humidity days. (Epoxies specifically formulated for clear laminations show little to no blushing but they will fog if someone scared by what they hear about amines tries to wash before they are completely cured, and often people dont realize that, depending on hardener used and temperatures, it can take weeks) On old resin surface preparation involves a good sanding with rough sandpaper to obtain a mechanical bond, chemical bonds are not possible anymore and using acetone to soften the existing surface only compromises the strength of that resin. Sanding that way there wont be anything on the surface of an old repair to be re-finished with gelcoat. If possible, repairing close to or over old patches, try to eliminate completely the old patch and re-do the whole. For very big patches might be necessary to take a mould of the section, prepare the piece on that and once cured cut off the area on the boat and replace it. If you need to shape the outside of a patch to reduce the final sanding epoxy wont adhere to packing tape or saran wrap but still cure under them. With epoxies acetone is pretty much used for cleaning only, duty that can be easily accomplished with simple vinegar. Metal tools like rollers to eliminate air etc are not used with epoxies and a good 90% of the tools needed are single use (measuring cups, spatulas, mixing sticks... all can be found between regular items much cheaper than the dedicated paint store versions) 

These are precautions, you always need to keep in mind that there is the abnormal rare case, unfortunately. More or less, these principles are also valid for a lot of the other animals you will find around, from coyotes to moose and others, each region has their own wildlife, predators or simply dangerous Edit, concerning bearspray: I just finished a chat with some friends from CA and I mentioned to them Ben Cromwell comment about it since its their area. The opinions they gave me was mixed but was also raised the issue of legal/illegal including that a Park Superintendent could have the power to allow it. Not having any reliable source one way or the other I would like to suggest to keep the issue of legality in mind and check with park authorities about that. Here in Canada its legal only as bear deterrent (and suggested by park authorities). 

Keep in mind that any water you are cooking with is still liquids you are intaking. A pantry full of dehydrated food is an awesome weightsaver in places were you always have water available but in a dry place you need to carry it with you. Efficiency-wise, I personally found the scout kelly-kettle type stoves ( kelly kettle + pot on top) great for boiling water while cooking another at the same time in the pot on top of the kettle, not much fuel needed. And one way to conserve the water is to rinse the cup you ate in and drink it before washing it If you were to use the precooked rice with warm water it takes about half hour to bring it back and you still should bring it to a boil after. I know of people that just soak it for a long time and eat it as it is but I think they must be crazy. Since from your question it seems you think you cook rice boiling, draining and throwing the water out, be aware that many kinds of rice don't work that way. If you take uncooked Jasmine rice, for example, the ratio is 1 part rice and 1 1/2 part water and all the water is absorbed by the rice (so way less than a liter, 250 ml of water will be even too much for one person). Forget Arborio or similar as they take long time to cook. Precooked rice works the same as it will absorb the water and at 1 to 1 ratio usually and faster cooking. You might want to redo your calculations then and probably find out you can expend the fuel to bring the water to a boil ;). Also Dhara gave you an excellent suggestion in the comments as there are recipes for eating the flakes raw it seems. Then, if what you mean is the ready to eat kind that comes in a bowl or similar to cook in a microwave or stovetop, that usually involves boiling the unopened container in water for more than just a few minutes. I suppose you could reuse the same water over and over as Aravona mentioned in the comments but then that stuff needs to be in the water at high temperature and for a certain amount of time to heat up or its like you didn't heat it at all. Its not the best option as weight saver, or the cheapest IMHO and with those you better stick to the cooking instructions. Also consider couscous, it cooks really fast, or thin rice noodles. For the instant mash potatoes in powder those can be made with cold water, you have to get the worst kind that have only powder with no flakes. The powdered stuff is not that great so you might want to give it a try at home (on a trail all the food is ok even if disappointing at home) and maybe add some milk powder, gravy powder and butter powder (if you can find it) and some spices to turn them from barely edible to barely passable. I dont know your tastes in food but going with all the normal grocery store instant foods the more spices you have at hand the better because they tend to be very bland. Also remember to keep an eye on proteins, as you will have to add those too and keep in mind that instant food has less nutrition than what you would have cooking it yourself from raw. Or you can go the MRE way, those with the self heating chemical pack, the only water needed in those is the one for the chemical reaction, you dont drink it, dont keep it and its not in direct contact with food so can be any water you find. They are not cheap if you dont have a "direct source" and for a whole week it will be sad but covering 2 or 3 days with those might mean the weight savings you want. Or FSR for extremes, but only if you plan to be too tired to be thinking about how sad is the meal you are eating ;) With a diet of instant rice and instant potatoes (and the military stuff) for a week you better bring some form of fiber supplements or you will cut down on bathroom breaks quite a bit ;).
