Coupling refers to communication and interchange of information between models. For example a typical standalone atmospheric model may be initialized with information about sea surface temperature. Depending on the model the ocean may be treated as a heat reservoir and may or may not affect any change to the SST. The ocean itself is not modeled. Similarly an ocean model may parameterize the atmosphere and only care about surface temperature and moisture fluxes (and perhaps momentum fluxes for waves) which may be static or prescribed values. Contrast this to a coupled model where the atmosphere and ocean models exchange data with each other so that they can evolve as a whole. Rather than the atmosphere seeing a static SST, it sees the modeled SST from the ocean model. Because the ocean is modeled even more information than just SST is available to the atmosphere model. CESM in particular is a family of models that all talk to each other to model earth, air and water as a whole system. 

The blue points in the map above are drifters than can report sea level pressure. Summary Weather models that assimilate these observations will use sophisticated algorithms to "fill in the gaps" and produce a continuous field of global sea level pressure. Aircraft can report pressure, but knowing pressure at altitude won't yield sea level pressure without knowing (or making assumptions) about the state of the atmosphere between the airplane and the surface. Upper air observations are good though, and quite important to forecasting and generally much more sparse than ocean surface observations are. 

Humidity will increase during a rainstorm as rain and puddles evaporate. Temperature will decrease toward the wet bulb temperature. As noted in the answer, there isn't a magic number of %humidity that causes rain to start. 

The primary mechanism at work here is the type of clouds that exist at different altitudes. Low clouds of the cumulus or strato-cumulus variety are optically thick and reflective. These types of clouds will scatter more light than they transmit or absorb, and the energy scattered upward and back into space will not contribute to warming. High clouds outside of convection tend to be cirrus clouds, which are icy and not optically thick. These clouds let light pass through freely (you can see the sun through these clouds). This lets solar energy through but they will absorb longwave (terrestrial) radiation, and this is what will contribute to warming. This is where a lot of the uncertainty in cloud feedbacks in a warming climate comes from. If we get more clouds -- low, bright clouds, then this could contribute to cooling, wheras high, transparent (to shortwave) clouds would contribute to warming. Again, it is not so much the high vs low that matters here, it is the properties of typical clouds at these heights. 

The first bullet point is going to be modified by energy transfer between the ground and the air (conduction) and radiative losses (radiation emission). These changes are on the scale of how temperature changes between morning and afternoon -- nothing too radical. The second bullet point is where the radical changes can take place. Temperature is a property of the air, so if new air moves in to your location with a different temperature, that will strongly determine the local surface temperature. 

This a type of arcus cloud called a shelf cloud and is caused by moist air rising over cool thunderstorm outflow. These clouds can look quite dramatic but do not pose any threats themselves. However, they can signal the presence of strong winds behind the gust front. These clouds can often be associated with strong convection -- squall lines, supercells, etc. These storms often have strong inflow coming from ahead of the storm supplying the storm with moisture. The storm is producing rain-cooled air and this dense air wants to spread out along the ground. If the outflow becomes too cool (relative) or the inflow weakens, the storm outflow can race ahead of the storm. This will produce strong winds as the gust front surges ahead and if the inflow is moist enough it will produce a cloud as it rises up and over the cool outflow. This cloud marking the gust front as it the rises up and over is a shelf cloud. These definitions are taken from a NWS storm spotter glossary: 

This shows a tongue of moisture being advected by the southerlies out of the gulf. Surface temperature (F): 

There are a couple reasons for this. First, Lake Michigan is still cold this time of year, relative to the land that surrounds it. Warm air flowing over the lake will exchange heat and cool, reducing its buoyancy, which will alter the heights at which clouds will form and inhibit lift for surface parcels to achieve that height. That helps explain the cloudlessness over the lake, but this extends a bit inland as well. I'd have to do a little digging to verify this, but just from that image it looks like that demarcation of cloud/no cloud around the lake is a sea breeze front (or in this case, a lake breeze). The daytime lake breeze flows inland from the water, rises over land and then flows back to the lake where it descends. This will promote clouds where the circulation rises and inhibit them where the circulation falls. There may also be an orographic effect on along the northern portion of western MI shore, as there are large sand dunes and hills in that area. The upslope flow could be the reason the clouds hug that shore a bit closer than other regions around the lake. In summary, that looks like a really well defined lake breeze circulation, which explains the shape and location of the clouds. 

Robert Cartanio's answer makes very good points, and I'll accentuate them with some examples. Thunderstorms tend to produce "hard rain" and larger scale organized convection will have areas of hard rain and areas of weaker rain. Air-mass thunderstorms are the type of daily convection you see in Florida and elsewhere. These tend to appear somewhat fast, rain out and be gone in short time. The other answer dispels the idea that the clouds rain themselves away. The reason for the short duration is that the rain cooled air underneath the storm blocks new moist warm air from entering the storm cloud, and it as the moisture is cut off, the storm dies. A contrary example is a supercell thunderstorm, which will have extremely heavy precipitation and hail near the updraft. These storms can persist for hours, but your perception of how long the "heavy rain" lasts will be a function of the storm motion. A fast-moving supercell may pass by at 70 knots and you'll experience the heavy rain for a few minutes. A stationary supercell will give you the impression that the heavy rain lasts for an hour or longer. If you follow both of the storms they may have produced heavy rain for the same amount of time. Similarly, a squall line will produce heavy precip with lighter precipitation behind it (usually, the stratiform rain can precede the convective rain or be laterally offset from it). How long this precip lasts (from your point of view) will depend on how fast it is moving. Regardless of how long you observe it for, it will likely last much longer as it moves. The stratiform region will be larger than the convective reason, so you will observe the lighter rain lasting longer than the heavy rain, but both will last for similar time scales. In the cold season it is not uncommon to find stratiform rain, drizzle or snow that seems to last all day, and this might give the impression that light rain lasts a long time. In the hurricane season, strong convection can persist for weeks (though it might only observe a timescale of a day as it makes landfall where you live). The point of all this is that the duration and intensity are strongly a function of the dynamics and your Eulerian point of view observing at a fixed location as a storm moves by. In the Lagrangian sense you'll find the correlation between duration and precipitation intensity is dependent on the dynamic and thermodynamic environment they are in. 

The balance of the two forces you mention (gravity and the pressure gradient force) is called hydrostatic balance and is given by the equation: $$\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g$$ This holds for the large scale atmosphere but commonly invalid in the troposphere at the mesoscale where regions of large vertical motion are present (cyclones, thunderstorms, forced lifting, etc). Below the turbopause (~100 km) the atmosphere is well mixed and is relatively homogeneous in its chemical makeup. Above the turbopause the atmosphere becomes heterogeneous and stratifies into layers with the heavier elements lower and the light elements higher. Tow W's answer explains the escape methods well, and I wont recap them here. I'll just add that due to the atmospheric composition above the turbopause, we tend to lose the lighter elements to space such as hydrogen and helium more than the heaver ones. 

In general if $\alpha$ is the mathematical angle and $\beta$ is the meteorological angle, then the relation between the two conventions is given by $$\alpha = 270^{\circ} - \beta$$ where angles are specified in degrees. 

From another perspective was the DC3 project, which I provided nowcasting in support of aircraft operations. This project didn't use dropsondes, but instead used aircraft in vertical flight profiles to collect observations from near-surface to tropopause levels. These profiles were in the vicinity of deep convection, but not within. This project was primarily interested in how the chemical composition of near-surface air was modified by convection and then transported in upper air outflow. These aircraft were not dropping dropsondes but I'm not confident a UAV would have been able to fly too much closer to convection to drop into the storms. 

Both the Fujita (F) and Enhanced Fujita (EF) scales measure damage and then use damage as a proxy for wind speed. Wind speed at the low levels is not directly measured unless the tornado is either very close to a doppler radar site or there happens to be a mobile radar sampling it. This provides very few tornadoes with directly sampled wind speed and is the exception rather than the rule. Where the F and EF scales differ primarly is that in the EF scale construction methods may be considered, not just the damage observed. Damage is used as a proxy for windspeed by examining damage, construction techniques and methods (EF scale only), materials, and other factors and then determining what threshold wind speed could cause that damage. This means that identical damage can result in different windspeed estimates. For example, a house that is completely destroyed and leaves behind a clean concrete slab is generally considered EF-5 damage, but some houses with poor construction have been found to not be physically tied to the foundation. A particular case in northern GA, USA had tornado winds blow down a garage door and then lift the house directly off the slab and take it away. This also leaves a clean concrete slab, but the construction methods will cause a lower wind estimate and a weaker tornado determination because less wind was required to cause the damage. The only other difference between the F and EF scales are that some of the wind speed estimates have been lowered in the EF scale and more descriptive damage indicators are used for wind speed estimates to help standardize those estimates. In summary, the EF scale differs from the F scale: 

The Rossby radius of deformation ($\lambda_{R}$) is a length scale over which adjustment will occur while a system approaches geostrophic equilibrium. In my class noted I have this defined as the distance at which buoyancy becomes as important as rotation. Some examples are given here but do not show their derivation. 

Part of cyclone self development is a positive feedback between surface temperature advection and pressure changes at the tropospheric mid levels. As the cyclone matures the advancing surface cold front will correlate with low 500 mb heights and lower 300 mb heights. This response will perturb where the jetstream lies and indeed, the jetstream tends to lie over the fronts extending from a mid-latitude cyclone. If you conceptualize the fronts from one cyclone extending back and forward to the cyclones next to it, this is the "polar front" and gives you a rough idea of where the jetstream is. An additional factor in how the jetstream propagates is the particular shape of the jetstream. There are a number of blocking patterns (e.g. Omega block, Rex block) that tend to persist as a stationary feature once setup. Finally, remember that in an atmospheric column, pressure is just the weight of all the air above a height, and anything that can modify the column (e.g. surface heating, cooling, mid-level changes) can modify the 300mb heights and subsequently affect the positioning of the jetstream.
