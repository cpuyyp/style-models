I've been interested in the strength world for a long time. While I don't limit myself to any specific muscle groups, I never gain much strength. And when I do gain strength, I tend to lose it very quickly, even despite continuation and progression. In other words I will get a tiny burst of strength increase some days, but it fades away and I go back to "neutral" very soon (few days). I also have no balance of strength, as some days I'll feel much stronger and energetic in lifts, and other days I'll fatigue from almost nothing. Factors that could be considered: 1.I breathe through my mouth, not nose; very little breathing through nose. For this reason I don't breathe much, meaning I have adapted myself to breathe less to avoid gaping like a fish for breath out of my mouth, which looks stupid. Also, I have been made fun of for doing it, so I've learned to do it much less often, and in smaller amounts, etc. 2.I have no endurance and never train for it. Since I don't have any goals in the fitness world, it is pointless to me to consider doing reps since my only goals are strength, power, and ability to apply large loads of force. Fitness isn't crucial, but I don't know how "not important" it may be in the long run, since I see hugely fat and obese, out of shape, lazy people that can lift 600 lbs. Often I'll slowly try to increase the weight over every week or so, but I'll just do a few reps. If I lower the weight I do too much sarcoplasmic training, which I don't care for and doesn't show strength results. If I "moderate' the weight I just fatigue moderately, but don't see long-term gains. I've tried mixing the exercises around, changing types of weight, angles, doing bodyweight exercises, etc. There's no real improvement no matter what I do. I see people lift a weight twice a week and they're gaining strength instantly, and I do it for months and there's no noticeable progression. I eat what I can, but roughly 2,000+ calories a day at 5'9" tall. Probably 60-100 grams of protein, decent nutrients, but diet could improve if I had the option to improve it. I get 6-8 hours of decent sleep every night; sleep isn't great, but it's decent. I do static/dynamic stretching, warm-ups, have normal levels of testosterone, start with light weights to get a good "feel", then work up. What could be wrong here? I was advised to consult a physician by some people, but it sounds kind of stupid since there's no noticeable problems with me that would impede strength gains. Programs? I don't follow any, but any decent regimen of training should increase strength. People got stronger before "strength programs" existed, so I will not consider any, including Starting Strength. 

I have been climbing and competing in this sport for a long time. I am not a mountaineer but I have done a lot of sport climbing in the past and have been primarily bouldering for the last 8 years. For hand strength I suggest being very cautious in how hard you push yourself in this regard. Always use open hands when doing training specific to finger strength (no crimping). Be cautious of your tendons in your fingers. They take longer then your muscles to improve. For hand strength I use a rice bucket about 5 gal filled to train both grip strength and the antagonist muscles in my hands. I push my hands as deep as possible and squeeze the rice. Near the bottom of the bucket should be quite a lot of resistance. For the antagonist muscles I use my wrist and fingers to push the rice back. This should engage the back side of your wrist and forearms. This is an odd but fairly common tool in the climbing community. The following workout I do not recommend if you have not been working grip strength regularly for at least 6 months. I also do dead hangs to train hand strength. Because you do not have access to a climbing wall and I am guessing you do not also have access to a hang board for climbing a sturdy door jam will likely work. For sport climbing I usually hung with an open hand grip for 30 sec then rested for 30 sec for ten reps and I would do this three times. For lock off strength without access to a wall I am sure someone here can help you find a routine with weights for that. If you have a pull up bar you can train most of the range with frenchies. This is a modification on a pull up where you hold the up position for 4 - 6 sec and then hold the half way down for the same time and then if you want repeat holding at the 3/4 and 1/4 positions. Obviously this is only part of what you need to climb hard but I think other people on this site are more qualified to help with those aspects. 

I would like to expand on Megasaur's post and say that most of the reading I have done agrees with my experience and that is that a climber should avoid campusing on this type of board until they have been climbing for about a year and a half or more and is climbing in the range of V7. If these requirements are not met I would recommend a system or Moon board to train on in the mean time. I have seen strong climbers end their climbing careers on these boards by getting on them too soon. 

As far as I know, people who spend 8 hours stainding still (like shop personnel, assembly-line workers or standing security), have got problems too, mostly with their feet and legs: edemas, etc... I haven't conducted any serious research on it, but this makes sense. And in the beginning standing long will definitely be inconvenient or even painful. So in my opinion the best thing would be to make standing/sitting shifts, like 2-2-2-2 or what your body will "tell" you. By the way, if you start standing and abandon breaks/walks (which you are having every N minutes, aren't you?), it might be not good for your eyes and limbs. 

Unfortunately, just participating in any kind of sports can't help you with determination (internal fortitude) by itself. I've tried mountaineering, running, aikido and yoga, and each of them can help with this goal if you have the right state of mind, but each of them can make you even weaker (mentally), when you are practicing with wrong thoughts. My own method to improve determination is to state goals for yourself, which are just a little above your skill/strength, as you are feeling it. And successfully accomplishing these goals. For example, if you are in the middle of your (say, 10 km) running workout and sprain your ankle, you can choose to run home (though slower) or even to take a slightly longer route, instead of calling for help. I mean no torturing yourself, but just fighting with difficulties which are hard, but have no real danger (I've been in this situation a couple of times, last time yesterday, and all was well afterwards, but "your mileage may vary"). Being on the mountain and having to climb on and on because storm/night is coming, you find that you can go further (and even make right decitions) even when yor last sleep was 30 hours ago. All this can make you believe, that you can handle a lot of difficult situations, and shows you that your effort gives its result, even if it takes time. So in the next difficult situation you'll just fight longer - this is internal fortitude. On the other hand, this "going over your head", if overused, can be unsafe and lead you into trouble (or plainly make you feel weaker, if you fail to accomplish your goal again and again). Here you should use your common sense and wisdom. You can begin experimenting with this by exercising longer. In particular, when you feel that you can endure no more, give a promise to yourself to exercise +10% of what you have done already. Running is ideal for this type of experiments. 

So, first, you need do save energy for kilometers 2-5, thus do not run your maximum during the first km. Second, you can just stop and relax after you finish the 5-th km, so you can spend the remainder of energy on your last 1 km or 500 meters. Just remembering this will help. Speaking about tricks: you can train with a GPS-enabled sports watch or a GPS-enabled phone (e.g. iPhone or Android phone) with a sports app (e.g. Endomondo, RunKeeper, ...). They usually show (or speak out) your "lap" pace. You can set lap length to 1 km or 500 m and try to keep all the laps with the same pace as the first one. It will need some experimenting to find the pace which is not too high and not too low for you. Then stick to this pace and maybe try to improve it gradually. During the competition you can go for a little higher pace - you will probably know how much you can allow before it kills you, if you have had enough experience training.
