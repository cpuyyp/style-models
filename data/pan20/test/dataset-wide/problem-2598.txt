According to the Girimananda Sutta, the Buddha teaches the ill monk Girimananda ten contemplations, through Ananda, which healed him of his disease. I take it here, that the Buddha wants to get the monk to contemplate on these things that helps him to overcome cravings. 

So based on the image below, when craving is ceased, the rest of the "present causes" are terminated, resulting in the "future effects" also being terminated. However, the "present effects" still persist as long as the Arahant is still alive in the current life. 

In this video, Ven. Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu says that the whole of the Buddhist teachings could be summarized as Appam훮da (heedfulness), at the risk of oversimplification. In the Mahaparinibbana Sutta (DN16), the Buddha conveyed the last message of his life: 

You can call yourself a Dhamma follower or Dhamm훮nus훮r카 in Pali. Please see this answer for details. The term is used by the Buddha himself in the Kitagiri Sutta (MN70) and the Okkanta-samyutta (SN25). In the Kitagiri Sutta, a Dhamma follower is defined as: 

The above excerpt and this video featuring a talk by Ven. Dhammavuddho, implies that the Five Hindrances (panca nivaranani) not just affect meditation. They could also habitually obsess one's mind and prevent progress even outside meditation. I also see that they are among the ten fetters (samyojana). Questions: 

It doesn't say that those are offences. It says that a stream winner is not capable of these acts. Since a stream winner is fully convinced in the Buddha and his teachings, he is not capable of taking another teacher. A stream winner has also reached the level of spiritual maturity that makes him incapable of committing matricide, patricide and murder of an enlightened person. Not just matricide, patricide and killing arahant, according to the Cakkhu Sutta, the stream winner "is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades." Also in this verse, The Buddha said "the sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish others to get killed." 

The above discusses emptiness from the perspective of the Pali Canon and the Theravada tradition. If you want perspectives from other Buddhist traditions, please see the wikipedia page on Sunyata. Here is a related quote by Sogyal Rinpoche from the perspective of inter-dependence or conditioning (Sogyal Rinpoche (2009), The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, Harper Collins, Kindle Edition): 

A monarch or ruler should not be violent, but he should not be "impotent" either. He should be competent enough to protect and take care of his people. Gandhi was in his own way, a "wheel-turning monarch" who brought independence to his people and founded a nation, with little or no violence. The following comes from DN 26: 

So, although the dhamma is our teacher, but a living teacher (who is experienced) would be able to answer questions. The earlier part of the sutta explains why it is good to gain a correct understanding and grasp of the teachings. 

There are different types of meditation. For basic insight meditation based on the mindfulness of breathing, you can consider starting with Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu's "How To Meditate" series for beginners, which is available as a YouTube video playlist or as an online booklet. This meditation is based on the four foundations of mindfulness. It comes in the varieties of sitting and walking meditation. Thanissaro Bhikkhu's "A Guided Meditation" and "Basic Breath Meditation Instructions" instruction sets combine mindfulness of breathing with body scanning (or sweeping). There's an audio version of these instructions in this YouTube video. This meditation is quite suitable for beginners. I like the fact that it begins with some thoughts of loving kindness (metta) before proceeding to the rest of the meditation. 

You've been here since forever due to craving and ignorance. Ignorance of not knowing the Four Noble Truths. There are 3 types of craving - sensual, becoming and unbecoming. Basically, you're here because you deeply want to be here, you want to enjoy sensual pleasures, you want to become somebody, you want to live a full happy life and you did not know about the Four Noble Truths till the "man with good eyesight standing on the river bank" told you. There's no need to blame Mara or anyone else. You're here because you craved to be here. From Itivuttaka 114: 

Regardless of the type of caste one is in, all have an equal opportunity to become enlightened. From the Gihi Sutta: 

This basically means that you should have determination and perseverance towards achieving your goals, in this very lifetime. And don't compare yourself to those much better than you, for their path would be different from your's. Of course, some goals may not make sense, for e.g. if I wasn't born in the USA, then I cannot become the President of the USA. In MN57, the Buddha said of the ascetic who had taken the vow to live like a dog, that if he lived his life behaving like a dog, thinking like a dog and having the mind of a dog, fully and without break, then he will be reborn in the company of dogs in future, if his vow is successful. So, similarly, I would surmise that if you vow to become an actor, and take the effort to try to become an actor, study acting, practise acting, thinking like an actor etc., fully and without break, then you could be reborn in a destination where it is conducive for you to become an actor and also possess the talent of acting. Such is speculated of child prodigies too. 

There is nothing wrong in using personal pronouns like I, you, me, he, she etc. or addressing oneself or others. After all, the Buddha used personal pronouns and addressed others too. For example, from the Akkosa Sutta, the Buddha said: 

In the Yuganaddha Sutta (AN 4.170), there is described the four paths stated below. Insight refers to vipassana and tranquility refers to samatha. 

So, reading both parts of these suttas together, one withdraws from sensuality and unskillful qualities, and enters the first jhana, in which he can only experience the pleasure and joy dependent on what is skillful. He would not experience pleasure or joy or pain or distress from sensuality and unskillful qualities. According to the "Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines" by Nyanatiloka Mahathera, on kilesa: 

If every single person in a city or country practised the first precept with heedfulness, and also practised Right Livelihood, which prohibits trade in meat, then nobody would work as a butcher. Those practicing Right Livelihood would also not be meat importers, suppliers or retailers. The first precept is not about vegetarianism, or any type of diet. It's about allowing sentient beings to live with ease. However, if you observe the first precept, it is still ok to buy and consume meat that was frozen in the supermarket. The reason for this is that you did not have the intention to kill and in fact, you did not kill that animal. You're simply buying frozen lifeless meat that was long dead before you arrived at the supermarket. Please also see this question for a detailed discussion on this topic . 

There are many techniques that were taught by the Buddha and also later, other techniques were developed by Buddhist teachers over history, that are based on the Buddha's teachings. You are right that some of these techniques may be mutually exclusive to each other. However, we must understand that each technique is used for a particular purpose, for a particular situation, to cater for a particular need. It is just like how a master chef uses various techniques to craft the best results based on the needs. Sometimes you need to boil, sometimes you need to bake, sometimes you need to fry and sometimes you need to sautee. These techniques are mutually exclusive but used at different times to achieve different results. I'm not sure, but I guess Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness is similar to insight meditation (vipassana). You can find guidance on the basics of insight meditation in the booklet entitled "How To Meditate" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. This technique is used to gain insight into the workings of dependent origination. Also read "The Way of Mindfulness" by Ven. Soma Thera, which is an essay that discusses the Satipatthana Sutta. But you can't progress in insight meditation, if you are strongly assailed by the five hindrances. To solve this, one technique is in the Vitakka-Santhana Sutta which teaches the forceful removal of unskillful thoughts. Forceful removal of thoughts is not part of insight meditation, but if you are too disturbed by unskillful thoughts, then you need to forcefully remove it. To eradicate the hindrance of ill-will, you can use Loving Kindness (metta) as the technique for eradication. Intentionally generating thoughts of loving kindness is also not part of insight meditation. For overcoming lust (as a hindrance of sensual desire), you can use the contemplation on unattractiveness (see this question). But too much of it may lead to negative thoughts of suicide, in which case, use the mindfulness of breathing (see this answer) to counter it. Intentionally contemplating on unattractiveness, is also not part of insight meditation. Also, samatha meditation (see the article entitled "Entering the Jhanas" by Leigh Brasington) is yet another technique used to calm the mind, and create focus and concentration. This is yet another technique that could help insight meditation. But it can be developed on its own too. If you are continuously disturbed in every way in meditation and cannot progress further, then the technique to solve this, is the development of virtue (sila) outside of meditation - see this answer for details. So, although different approaches appear to be mutually exclusive, they are actually complementary. The Buddha taught the practitioner to be multi-skilled. That's why there's the Noble Eightfold Path, rather than a Noble One Single Technique to End Suffering. No one technique is sufficient to achieve the results. 

If you consider the ability to concentrate the mind, as a kind of mental energy, then according to the Mettanisamsa Sutta (AN11.16), metta or loving kindness is one way to gain mental concentration easily: 

To me, it does not matter if the mind arose neurologically in the physical brain or not. My analogy is that software or data is composed of the bits of 1s and 0s on the physical media of a computer, for example, harddisk and RAM. So, it is electronically and chemically originated. However, software can be copied or transferred to other computers or other physical media over networks. So, while software depends on physical media, this does not impede it from moving to other physical media. So, my second question is, does it really matter (in terms of holding the Right View) if the mind is neurologically originated or not? I think if the mind is neurologically originated, it does not matter and does not impede the notion of rebirth or continuity of the mind stream, just like in the case of software. 

The five forms of fear and animosity are stilled by the relentless practice of the five precepts. The four factors of stream-entry are verified confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and having "virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration." The noble method is the understanding of how suffering is ended by the realization of dependent origination. The one who has fulfilled the above, becomes a stream winner, who is guaranteed freedom from rebirth in lower realms. 

This shows that only a Sammasambuddha has the psychic or supernatural ability to recognize the attainment of others. Even one Arahant cannot recognize another Arahant. 

You have to differentiate the goal of science from the goal of Buddhism. Science aims to understand nature empirically, while Buddhism aims to end suffering. You have to differentiate the method of science from the knowledge of science. The scientific method is empirical, which is quite the same in spirit, as the Buddhist method. The knowledge of science however, is continuously updating. For example, Newton's Laws of Motion predicted most of the observations of motion, but could not explain them precisely. Einstein later was able to explain it precisely and also calculate almost all motion and gravity except for those at the quantum level. All these were empirically proven. However, Einstein's theory has now been improved with String Theory for quantum gravity, but this is difficult to prove or disprove. This shows that science is continuously updating. The Buddha's methods only need you to prove to yourself that you can end your own suffering. If you became enlightened, it's hard to definitively prove that to others, but that's not needed. The scientific method needs the scientists to prove or disprove hypotheses to others. And unfortunately, the Buddhist enlightenment is not something that can be easily physically proven to others. Retired physics professor Richard Muller wrote here a few days ago: 

From your description, your problem is mainly increased mood swings, anger and depression when you're not meditating. For this, insight meditation could be helpful. Ven. Yuttadhammo writes in this chapter entitled "Daily Life" of his booklet How To Meditate (which in my opinion is primarily based on insight meditation): 

The Noble Eightfold Path is like a summary that contains the whole boundary of framework for the "right teachings" and the Buddha is fine with other doctrines and disciplines, taught by others, as long as it is compliant with the Noble Eightfold Path. And as far as I can see, the main traditions of Buddhism are definitely compliant, though appearing divergent on the details of concepts and practice. In fact, if I were to reduce the doctrinal framework to the bare minimum, it would be: 

The immaterial world has beings with mind but no body. This world is above or beyond the gods (brahmas and devas). The realms here include: 

In Udana 7.2, Ven. Sariputta (the Arahant) tried to teach Ven. Bhaddiya without realizing that he too was an Arahant. The Buddha saw this and exclaimed the verse, describing Ven. Bhaddiya: 

I'm not sure how he knows this. When I read it, it sounds to me like the world of microbes. Your amoebas and paramecia and millions or billions of other types of microbes definitely come in all shapes and sizes. Until the invention of the microscope, we couldn't see microbes, but that does not mean that they do not exist. So, it's good to keep an open mind. 

A brief history of Gautama Buddha's life can be found here. The Buddha also described his noble search for enlightenment in the Ariyapariyesana Sutta, including the shramanic (ascetic) teachers he studied under, before his enlightenment, but wasn't satisfied by their teachings. The first disciples were a group of five monks (according to this sutta):
