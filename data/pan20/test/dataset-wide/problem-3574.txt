I am practicing myself on the Total Immersion style of swimming, as I am practicing for long distance triathlon. After a lot of practice I am doing the 2 beat kicks with little difficulty. Can someone tell me the optimum angle the body (core) should turn during the raise of an arm? Sometimes I feel that I turn my core less and sometimes more. Please let me know if more detail is required on this question. 

Enjoy running Edit My understanding on heart rate and interval training: Resting heart rate is calculated by counting the pulse rate or heart rate after you lie down for half hour or so. Your maximum heart rate is approximately 220 - age. The difference between max and resting heart rate is taken as diff for further calculations. Generally long runs are run at a heart rate between 50 to 60% (resting heart rate + 50-60% of diff)comfortably. If the this percent is close to the max heart rate then the person will get tired soon. So the resting rate is to be reduced in order to reach greater speeds with ease, for long runs. For a normal man the resting heart rate is 72 bpm (beats per min). In order to reduce the resting heart rate, one does interval training, during which the heart rate is pushed close to the max heart rate (or held near the threshold limit for a long time) while sprinting (fast runs) and reduced to very low rate (as low as possible) during the resting period (or slow jog). This kind of subsequent peaking and reducing heart rate, results in lot of fat burning and over course of time reduces the resting heart rate. Thus the above method of intervals reduces resting heart rate and allows us to run fast for a long period of time (distance). 

What type of exercise? If it's short burst exercise such as the anaerobic exercise of body building, then simple carbohydrates are better: baked potato with cheese. For long aerobic exercise such as marathon running, slow burning complex carbohydrates work best - pitta breads, pasta. This book goes into a lot more detail: 

So the easiest way to immediately stop the stitch is to leave 1.5 - 2 hours after eating before running, and slow down to a speed where you don't get stitch. Usually it was the former though, and reducing how much I ate also helped (switching to a single pita, baked potato or cereal bar). If you want to relieve it while running, bending over forward with your hands towards the floor helps to relieve it, although you do look a bit stupid running down the road doing this. A simple breathing technique can help - breath in and hold your breath for 5 seconds, then as you exhale breath in as you're exhaling. It definitely gets easier if the two reasons I gave are the cause of the stitch. If the eating timing doesn't make any difference then a trip to the doctor or physio would be best. 

A marathon is altogether different league when compared to a 10 km run. There are many things to consider... 

Now the 3rd session is what I am thinking about. Shall I make it a sprint training with spike shoes on? Will it work good? If yes what regime shall I follow? If not what should I do in that session? If required I can cut one swim session and make it a run session. Please comment if more info needed from my side. 

I have a very hard hamstring. I can stretch my hamstring to a good extent, i.e., touch the floor without bending the knees with my knuckles but not beyond that. At that stretch point, I feel a stone-hard hamstring. Is it normal? Should I stretch further to obtain a loose and flexible hamstring? Or is there something other than stretching, which I should do? I jog some 1.5 km per day and do floor exercise (stretching and strengthening all different muscles) before hitting the pool. I some 2.5 km per day after the jog session. Will this help loose hamstring? Please help... 

You can't target the fat in your belly as everyone has pointed out, however you can do certain exercises that are best for fat burning. High impact aerobic exercise is better for fat burning than low impact - an example of low impact is swimming. A great high impact activity for fat burning is interval training. There's a 1001 variations on it, just Google "sprint training". Alternatively a sport like 5-aside football, tennis, basketball. You'll need to do those 2-3 times a week though to get any noticeable benefit. Here's a training routine from Men's Health a few years ago (which also re-iterated the paragraph above) 

This is wikipedia's answer, which I've been led to believe are the reason for the sensation both during and after exercise. 

Avoiding alcohol is the other obvious way to lose the belly fat. If you drink 2-3 pints of beer three times a week, being alcohol free for a week will lose you 0.25kg. 

I have started to run barefoot because no shoe suits my feet perfectly. I ran a half marathon yesterday and made my PB too, I am happy. But during the course of running I developed blisters. I enjoy the pain but I am scared that it may lead me to a bad injury, if I continue this. So my question is, is there any tape for barefoot running? I have heard of some tape but I don't know how they refer to it. How do they refer to it? Or is there any better ways to avoid blisters? I can't afford the five fingers shoe. Please help 

Has anyone got experience swimming in the sea? I live in India and the sea near my house is Bay of Bengal. This sea is madly violent. Crossing the initial waves is really tough. Being the first day today, I crossed them successfully but then suffered a lot. After crossing the initial waves, it was a little calm comparatively. So I feel I can do swim practice in the run up for my International triathlon coming up in Malaysia this Sep. Can anyone please suggest some good swim drills for sea swimming? Or is it necessary that I practice in the pool for speed rather than sea and that the sea swimming is just to get the feel not for speed training? 

The evidence for post-workout protein shakes increasing your performance for running isn't conclusive, so this is somewhat anecdotal advice. I've been running for about 4 years regularly and in the past 6 months tried protein shakes after the long and mid runs. I've increased my speed from 8.1mph to 9mph in that time, and up to 9.5-10mph for 5k runs. I've also lost weight in that period from the eating less via the protein shakes, A 500ml serving keeps you sated for an hour or so later until a main meal, and is about 120 calories. The protein powder I used is by Bio-synergy, which is whey powder (basically dried milk). The cheaper stuff you get at a discount seems to be missing not only taste, but some amino acids and bulked out with soya. The one chose is also targeted at lean muscle growth rather than body building/bulking up, which helps. It's an easy and fairly cheap experiment to try, just be sure to stick with a good brand that is carb free, and avoid the soya shakes. 

I have a new set of Resistance cord that I bought. Assuming that all brand resistance tubes are quite similar, what is the length of extension that I can give to it? Each cord is of 4 feet length. While doing a few exercise, I am required to pull it overhead(while standing), placing the cord under my feet and using both hands to pull. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall. I am afraid I will break the cord and injure myself while exercising. Hope this is not off-topic. 

Previously I had asked about carrying hand weights while running. Can we pull weights while running? Tie a rope to our hip and the weight. I am planning to run on the beach sand nearby. My question is, is there any use in doing this? Will I improve my speed or my strength or both? 

The advice they give you at runner shops: 6 months (I wonder why?!). Obviously it depends on how many miles you run per week, but you will notice the difference if you change them at least once a year if you do a lot of treadmill running, which is like rubbing them down on sandpaper. 

40 km per week sounds like enough training miles to do a 1/2 marathon comfortably, but 30km doesn't. Could this just be a case of not doing enough miles of training before the main event? Or alternatively you're running too many miles the week before? The general advice is to reduce the mileage to the short-run amount during the final week, and skip your final training session, replacing it as rest. $URL$ is showing a week between each training session. Is this correct? If so that is not the recommended* way of training for long distances. It should be atleast 3 sessions per week (short, medium, long), or 4 if you're going for PBs. The long run should eventually be around 11-12 miles in the final week before the race. * Recommended being Runnersworld.com and this book 

Please refer image for the cartilage I am talking about. On the outer side of my left leg I experience pain after running very long distance (marathon). My doctor said that this pain is common for endurance athletes. A year back I got this pain after I finished my first half marathon. After some good running practice, I didn't get this pain at all for half marathons. But then I am getting this pain for full marathons now. Is there any specific strengthening exercise that will address this issue? I think there will be many of you having or had the same issue, so can anyone -who overcame this- help me? Or will I just get used to this? 

I am currently training for marathons (half & full) coming up in quick successions. My best is 1 hr 44 min for a half marathon. I haven't attempted the full marathon yet. But I have got the endurance to do it because I have done up to 3/4 Ironman. Right now I am doing only one HIIT session in a week. I do up to 5 cardios (mainly running, sometimes cycling) in a week. I strengthen my muscles (calisthenics or using resistance ropes) before or after every cardio session. In the HIIT, I warm up (jog, 900 - 1000 m) for 5 minutes. Sprint 200 m in 35 s & jog 200 m in 70 - 80 s and I repeat them 4 or 5 times. Then again cool down jog (800 m - 1000 m) for another 5 min. Now my question is how many times can I do this in a week? If I use the HIIT (eg: Tabata Protocol) for strengthening, not the same day as HIIT run schedule, is that considered as a separate HIIT session? Keeping in mind the recovery run schedules(0 - 1 session after the HIIT) and the Long distance schedules (I do once a week), can anyone guide me? By the way my age is 25. My resting heart rate ranges between 55 and 60. 

It has various studies to back it up but from experience is a bit of a pain to clean - you have to buy baby milk bottle sterializer to clean them with. 

The secret to feeling full is combining protein with carbohydrates, which also gives you the added benefit of aiding the transport of the increased Tryptophan from the protein. There's a tonne of studies to support this, to quote one: 

Use a running track. Sprint 100m as fast as you can, then jog the rest. Repeat 5 times. Treadmill version: 20 second sprint, 60 seconds jog. "Enjoy a metabolism increase of 40%" 

In my (limited) experience I would recommend using the Smart Coach to set yourself speed goals. The tool speeds you up gently over a 12-16 week period (or less amount of time if you're feeling like a challenge). It gives you an indurance run, a gentle run and speed training each week. I only use it for 10k running so I can't speak for half or full marathon running, but it really improved my pace a lot - down to about 46 mins from 50+ mins.
