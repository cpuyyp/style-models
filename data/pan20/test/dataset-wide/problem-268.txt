One possibility - but not sure how to execute it - would be to use steam. Dig a hole, put a sealed metal cylinder with water in it and fire it up. Steam has tremendous power and if there will be enough pressure in the cylinder it would be much like explosion. But someone would need to run some pretty neat equations on cylinder size and water content and I'm not sure you can build one with only blacksmith-level metal craft. Any other way in a short form: not bloody likely. A bit longer answer: unless it's a really small dam, good luck! Long answer: there is a reason why most of the Roman-built dams are still around, with a lot of them still in use. You'd think that engineers who built roads and aqueducts that are around today and are definitely pieces of finest engineering would build a dam that is a simple wall? Yes, there are a few - like subiaco dam, which are like that, but they are exception to the rule. Subiaco especially, as it's said to be built so that Nero had a lake next to his villa. But most of them were lime or concrete (yes, concrete) core, with compacted earth and masonry to protect it against erosion. First of all you can forget catapult or trebuchet. Yes, they would crack the "outer layer", but will be completely ineffective against earth underneath. With limestone or concrete core you can forget burrowing. The only way to break solid Roman dam is with good-old earthworks: spades, picks and shovels. 

On Earth, snakes evolved from lizards mostly via simplifications. The most famous of those is the loss of legs. But the ears were also affected: when lizards actually hear sound in the range 500-4000 Hz (some up to 10000 Hz), snakes typically only respond to vibrations that they feel through they bellies in the 50-1000 Hz range (see here). There's Dollo's law: evolutionary losses are unlikely to reemerge. So I see 3 options for your snakes: 

Actually, who cares about defending anything? Nothing in the question says that the library can't have "regenerative" properties. It's already somewhat alive, so it can probably completely "heal" itself, replacing missing scrolls with copies and repairing any shelves, walls, ceilings, etc. Since triggered by damage, the "healing" can be done by "spells used as a trap", so it's involuntary (like in humans) and doesn't need any conscious act from anyone sentient. The library could be built with a healing factor so great that it could regenerate itself from a single sliver of its shelves (no mana is needed, helpers can be temporarily summoned, so really, are there any limits?) In this case, it probably will welcome raiders, not stop them, so any garbage from breaking things will stick to their clothes, and then will get carried away by the raiders. And then new clones of the library will grow in other places all over the world, spreading the knowledge. Thus fullfilling the purpose of the library better. 

Energy is energy, but the origin matters. Kinetic energy of a projectile comes from somewhere, that is: there needs to be energy expenditure in the first place. However, in contrast to projectiles laser cannot be easily deflected nor absorbed. Plasma energy is much harder to achieve, and is - at least theoretically - much easier to defend against (simplifying: strong enough e-m shield can dissipate it). SO in conclusion: d.e.w. actually needs only reliable high-capacity power storage to be technologically viable as of now. And, thinking on it, if one wants to trade some of the combat readiness time for power levels, capacitors+batteries setup is possible even now for something reasonable. Kilowatt laser (equivalent to roughly 2x45.ACP)? There are capacitors now available allowing for 8 shots, in the size of two shotgun shells and weighing much less than that (I know; simplification). 

for starters let's look at powering Earth from orbit in 100%. So 200 TWh Current level tech +20 years caveat means no space industry in place. So let's say I want to start working on it next year (2018). Any way of sending and/or form of energy goes. 

As other answers point out, the 1st area is not reachable. Every phone must transmit radio waves, and it must identify itself to the network to receive calls/traffic. If your special phone doesn't do it, it can't function within the network. Cloning the phones of the normal people isn't reliable (they will receive your calls sometimes), and in the end, traceable. You could get somewhere near the 2nd area, however. With cooperation of the entire industry and government, a side channel can be built into the network that would use onion routing to throw traffic of some select phones randomly across the whole network, hiding the original phone. It requires cooperation of another parties, however, as otherwise your side channel won't be kept in the system, and you can even be punished for being sneaky. And such cooperation is unlikely: 

Yeah... A mundane medieval army is at huge disadvantage against this Army X. It's just not possible to do any lasting harm to them or deprive them of any significant amount of important resources. And there's no magical way to stop them, like summoning a bigger fish or holding the whole world hostage. Which leaves few paths to the victory open, one of them being to Surrender to the Army X And after that, use non-military means to make holding you and your resources bad for them. If those sword and shields can't bring you a victory, just don't use them at all, and don't waste your people in the process. Use them in another way, applying social and economical pressure against the Army X that the winner of the war wouldn't be able to avoid. Like: 

D.E.W. is any tacticians wet dream. I believe they will be developed parallel with advanced projectile weapons, but I think absent some technological breakthroughs in high power projectiles area it will be laser weapons at first. Why: 

It's instantly vacuum-rated, recoilless, non-ballistic characteristic, reactionless etc. Power source for them can be unified across the board (that is: no different calibers, calibres etc.) 

All answers missing very crucial point: there is a fundamental difference in approach to building exoatmospheric vessels compared to endoatmospheric. Spaceships need to have reinforced hulls to prevent EX-plosion, while air- and sea- borne vessels are reinforced to prevent IM-plosion. One atmosphere of atmospheric pressure seems like not much, but in space it's actually a tremendous force just on it's own. Those two goals can be jointly pursued in construction, but that means excess mass. Space shuttle is not big because why? There is also a world of difference in power requirements to move spaceship in space and to move it up (and down) gravity well. I know mass is mass, but for the purposes of the question it's suffice to say there is a difference. So that means high power requirements, which also means size of the PGU (Power Generating Unit), which cuts into capacity of a spaceship's hull, as is extra reinforcements and quite possibly some aerodynamic requirements. Space combat vessel needs to be armored in some way. If you elect atmospheric braking it means that outer layer - i.e. armor - is exposed to extreme conditions not unlike combat (depending on weapons used in warfare, of course), thus weakening it enormously. Armor in spaceships has dual-purpose: prevent/absorb combat damage and shield from all sorts of radiation encountered in space. Current space tech relies on E-M shield of Earth to work in space, but spacegoing vessels have to have this sort of protection. Weakening that every time you enter atmosphere sort of defeats the purpose. Thus we get to a bottom line: I recommend dropping the idea unless you give your civ enormous power source(s) (or other techs like force fields reinforcing hull or reactionless drive of some sort) to accommodate for all the requirements of the concept. 

In quantum mechanics, no true omniscience is possible, and all "practical approaches" to omniscience are inherently limited. Wavefunctions are fundamentally separated from observables, and only observables can be known by any observer, even by a god. There's an inherent behavior within the wavefunction that adds non-removable randomness to most observables. It cannot be suppressed or removed in any way without breaking the fundamentals of existence. So the whole situation could be like the Schr√∂dinger's cat to Chronos. He could literally not know the outcome until he observed the actual result. All his godly knowledge would be powerless to penetrate into the wavefunction, as it was not possible at all. He only could know probabilities of various outcomes, and had to take a bet, hoping for the best. Him being god of time would not help him in the slightest, as the passage of time can't remove indeterminism from quantum observations. Forcing a deterministic outcome would destroy all balance in the world, at the very least. 

What would be the best way to send energy that is generated outside the Earth's atmosphere, possibly in the asteroid belt (nevermind the means), so that it can be used on the surface of the planet? Let's say solar power generation. With enough mirrors you can get really high output. The energy thus "gathered" can be "transmitted" down to Earth's surface, but it will be, in essence, a laser beam (i know, it will be concentrated sunlight, but I mean effect, not the naming details), that will be dangerous to anything in it's path, including the atmosphere. Assuming level tech of today but include current experiments in all stages of advance, what would be the best - that means safest, cheapest and most efficient - way to supply energy to the grid on the Earth's surface? Additionally: what would be the upper limit of the power levels to be transmitted? To clarify after some very good comments: 

Answer is, as most often is the case with "what if" questions, complicated. But in short it can be said: no problem understanding the theory, Replicating the machinery is a different matter. Simple steam engine was known in 1st Century AD - look up - and Romans had excellent understanding of parts of hydrodynamics - dams, pipes, aqueducts, pumps. So they would have no problems grasping the concept. But building a working engine requires more than just knowledge. I would say that it's possible to build very simple steam engine using Roman tech, but it would be very heavy and unreliable. As sphennings points out it requires high quality of metal alloy and a degree of precision manufacture not available to Roman tech base. I believe they would quickly found out that and after maybe several decades (on the fast end) to maybe a century at least (on the slow end) to be able to produce stable output. But the issue is not the tech, but the culture. Romans were uninterested in such things simply because they had enormous excess of power (slavery). Steam engine gained in popularity after it became light and small enough to build locomotive, for example, thus Romans would not have any use for their version. You would have to put this "discovery" in proper context (warship, i.e. ironclad maybe?). Industrial revolution in England began as a attempt to address the labor shortage that plagued (no pun intended) the Europe since.. well, the plague. Add wars (most notably the 100-years war, 30 Years War and 1000 Years Muslim Invasion) and the labor shortages are a fact of life until end of 19th century. In fact, the wars were mainly why the Europe was so poor for so long, as they sucked away lives needed to improve livelihood across the continent. What Roman need would a steam engine address? Most of the Roman trade is water-borne. Mediterranean is rather small sea, there is no economic nor political reason to invest huge capital to shorten the travel times by half - it sounds impressive until you realize that it means 3 days from Alexandria to rome instead of 7 or so (admit, I'm guessing here), and there are huge grain ships plying this route already. Sail ships, cheapest possible type. Rome-Londinium route? Again - current tech is enough and speed is not economically explainable. Raw materials needed to equip Roman legions and address needs of the population are there in sufficient numbers... The only way to improve average roman life is to increase supply of raw materials, but there is no way to do it. Last thing - for widespread use of steam engine supply of coal is needed. Wood is not good source of fuel. 

Simply put, neither Julian nor Gregorian calendars have holes in their own dates. They have a point in time that is the same date for both. After that, the 2 calendars are in sync for some time, but later start to diverge. For any single day after the divergence, 2 different dates exist, one Julian and one Gregorian. Since only one of the dates is normally used in everyday life, switching between the calendars requires to change the current date non-continuously on the switch day, creating the gap in the numbering. The gap was 10 day initially, but some countries joined lately, and their gap is larger (13 days in Russia, for instance). On the switch, there was never any intent to synchronize the calendars at the switch date. The point was to synchronize the spring equinox to its traditional location on the calendar, stopping its drift accumulated over a millenia. So the gap was expected and allowed. For some time after the switch, people tended to use dates from both calendars simultaneously for same days (sometimes called "old style date" and "new style date"). Although the Gregorian dates weren't really used before its establishment, the calendar can be extrapolated back in time; it's called proleptic calendar. With this system, most days in history have dual dates, but in practice it only confuses everyone, so it's not normally used. Please note that the divergence between Julian and proleptic Gregorian is not actually at the year 1, so 0001-01-01 dates in the 2 calendars don't match. So the best way to date a day before 1582 would be to just use its Julian date. That's what people actually used then, and that's what was written in any historical document.
