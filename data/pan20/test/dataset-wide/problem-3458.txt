If a stationary distribution exists, the time index no longer matters as t goes to infinity. Replace x_{t+1} and x_{t} by x and solve for x. What you obtain is a random variable whose distribution you can infer. In your case you get x = b/(1-a) N(0,1) which has normal distribution with mean 0 and variance (b/(1-a))^2. 

A Ponzi Scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading. Hence, cryptocurrencies are not Ponzi Schemes, since this would require some central authority falsifying records to mislead investors. Cryptocurrencies are specifically designed to make this type of fraudulent activity, which relies on information asymmetry and trust in a central authority, mathematically provably impossible. Nobody is buying shares in an investment scheme, investors are trading an asset among themselves in the most transparent way possible (Everyone has access to an immutable public ledger, the Blockchain, containing details about every transaction that has ever occurred). So in some sense, cryptos are the exact opposite of a Ponzi Scheme. On the other hand, one could make a case that Fractional Reserve Banking and Social Security are Ponzi Schemes. EDIT: Other answers have suggested that fraudulent activities are not a necessary condition for a Ponzi Scheme. Other objections to my answer include my use of a non reliable source. From a legal perspective, the last word on whether something is a Ponzi Scheme lies with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose definition should therefore be considered: A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters focus on attracting new money to make promised payments to earlier-stage investors to create the false appearance that investors are profiting from a legitimate business. Furthermore, it has been suggested that a group of actors attempting to drive up the price of cryptocurrencies by engaging in leveraged buying, are effectively running a Ponzi Scheme, and therefore cryptocurrencies are a Ponzi Scheme. I strongly disagree with this claim. Apart from the fact that it does not meet the definition, it is also not a claim about cryptocurrencies but about rogue actors using crypos in an attempt to implement a Ponzi Scheme. Any arbitrary asset could be traded in this way - this is not a specific characteristic of cryptocurrencies. Such "strategy" qualifies as deliberately creating a bubble, (an ill-conveived undertaking, exposing the creator to ever increasing market risk), rather than running a Ponzi Scheme. 

The feasible region is made up of the x and y axis, the blue line from the y-axis up to the crossing, and the orange line from that point on to the x axis. Let us now relax your constraint $K+2S\leq6$ by one unit, as you propose. In essence this means that the constraint becomes $K+2S\leq7$ and when we draw the new constraints we get: 

Not a real answer, but a few thoughts. (1) In principle I think it can be done as long as the preferences changes relate to current consumption trade-offs e.g. sweets versus bread now, rather than sweets now versus sweets tomorrow. The latter is the problem of time inconsistency you link to in your comment. There's a large literature on time inconsistency, hyperbolic discounting etc., see for example also Laibson's classic. Incidentally, if the consumer can somehow commit to a certain path, that solves the problem of the inconsistency. (2) If you're looking at the whole economy, a way around the problem is to work with a representative consumer that incorporates both the preferences of the young people and the elder people. As long as the relative proportions of the population do not change over time the representative consumer should make the same choices in the aggregate. (3) How to do this in a practical way in the utility function: you could include time dependent weights on the different goods, where one increases and the other one decreases. It would definitely become more difficult to solve, but would be doable for small problems, and if the weights are simple functions of time perhaps even possible for larger problems. 

Your y2 needs to be the output associated produced with those inputs. Given that you have a CES production function and you use World Bank Country data as inputs, you need output of the countries in that specific year. Typically we use GDP as a measure of output at country level. You can get it a.o. from the World Bank. 

In principle it's a plane for 2 independent variables or a hyperplane for more. An exception is when your independent variables are a continous and a dummy variable. In that case the dummy basically changes to the intercept only so you could show two lines with different intercepts. A work around if you have 2 continuous independent variables is to show the relation between the dependent and one independent for several values of the other independent. 

You are right that most discussions talk about complementarity in consumption, which is why this question is all the more interesting. Demand falls for potatoes, which causes the price of potatoes to fall, which causes the supply of potatoes to fall. This means there is less starch available. This in turn means that we can make less packing-peanuts, hence supply of packing peanuts falls. You are right that demand for packing peanuts does not change. The supply will nevertheless change however. This is because the supply of starch falls and the input factor of packaging peanuts is more expensive, so less is optimally produced. I.e. the supply curve of packaging peanuts changes, in this case shifts to the left so there is less equilibrium supply even though demand for packaging peanuts has not changed. 

A negative externality: Smoking. If everyone in the cafe would decide how much the smoker should smoke it would be very little as everyone has a cost (health har,), but no benefit. The smoker doesn't take into account other people's costs when he makes his decision. He smokes until: His own private marginal cost = his own private marginal benefit. However socially optimal would be marginal social cost = marginal social benefit. Since social cost is larger than private cost and social marginal costs are increasing in smoking, the socially optimal amount of smoking is less than the private optimal amount. So private decisions (as in a free market) do not lead to a socially optimal outcome. A positive externality: The producer of a good with positive externalities could be the builders of nice buildings which eveyone enjoys, because they're nice to look at. The builders gain a certain amount from the buildings. However everyone else also gains, but does not pay the builders for this benefit. Therefore that desire of the people is not priced in the builder's benefit and therefore the builder does not take it into account. So if society would decide they'd want more buildings than if the builder decides. 

My suggestion would be to try fixed effects/first differences with the qudratic terms if you have good reason for both. Otherwise use the specification you think has the most merit. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with R and cannot comment on the code. 

I'd expect both the employers and unions to fall for sunk cost arguments (can't quit now, we've gone so far...), which a rational player wouldn't do Repeated games in the presence of uncertainty often have multiple equilibria that can be supported by trigger strategies. Although these trigger strategies are subgame perfect, they are also non-renegotiation proof, and that is probably exactly what you're interested in. 

You make a mistake in setting up your individual profit functions. Given that the total revenues from sales are $y=K+L$ and they share revenues equally their revenues are $1/2*(K+L)$ 

What you need is the future value of an annuity. If you have a payment P paid for N years, compounding at an interest rate i, the future value of that is: $FV=P*( (1+i)^N - 1)/i$ This will give you the future value at the beginning of the year. To get it for the end you multiply with (1+i). In your example filling in P=8000, i=10%, and N=2 gives you 16800, which when multiplied with 1.1 gives you the desired 18480. 

The Penn World Tables for those countries goes back to 1990. Some of their indicators may even go back further but I haven't checked. Access to them is found here 

In principle it would be possible to do so. In fact this is exactly what we do if we convert a marginal effect at the mean to a willingness to pay. We calculate it for the average person in the dataset. One can also distinguish the average WTP by subgroups and socio-economic characteristics such as gender. The reason why academic papers do not often go beyond that (I guess) is that the predictions become so specific that they are hardly interesting anymore. Who would be interested in the willingness to pay of say "a 27 year old male with 12 years of education, an annual income of 24000â‚¬, voting republican and an interest in violent video games"? What about when he is 28 years old? Given that these models are typically non-linear their WTPs are going to be different. Moving to a practical point of view price discrimination at such detailed level is impossible at the moment and for a number of products it may even be illegal (insurance is an exception). Finally, a problem with any contingent valuation problem is that is willingness to say rather than willingness to pay. This is less of a problem in markets for goods with which the participants have experience with the good in question, but there will always be a bit of hypothetical bias. 

There is no universal definition of a modified IS-LM framework. There are several modifications out there. Some such modifications include adjusting the model to capture the last financial crisis or opening the economy with the BP curve as you said, or kore explicitly considering the role of banks. Another modification is the IS-MP model, which represents a more realistic version of monetary policy. 

I am in need of a variable measuring "demand for banking services" in general, on a country level. Specifically the (maximum) size of the market for banking services for a given country. This will be used as a control variable. Does anyone know any standard proxies or measures used in the literature to measure something like "total demand for banks"? I need something general, not a specific banking service. Something that summarizes the different sources of demand for banking services, such as some kind of constructed index or so. Something that summarizes everything/most services through which banks make profits. If that is not possible, are there maybe two standard measures that each cover demand for deposits and demand for loans? What variables are generally used? If nobody knows what is standard, does anyone have any plausible suggestions of proxies/measures for "demand for banking services"? Further, any suggestions on data sources I could use to get country level data (preferably a panel starting around the '80s or '90s) for such a variable? The proxy/measure need not be perfect. The only important thing is that it captures "the size of the market for banking services (in general)" in some way. Especially a measure of demand that would determine the (maximum) number of banks in a given country. 

There are no major models that come to the conclusion that idiosyncratic risk can drive positive returns. The reason is that idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable. The models, however, do in fact consider idiosyncractic risk. The theories don't forget or ignore them. It just turns out that this risk doesn't matter. In this sense, CAPM actually does consider idiosyncratic risk. In this model, if you are perfectly rational, you will diversify your portfolio to minimize risk. This leads you to hold the whole market portfolio, in which case idiosyncratic risks are diversified away in your portfolio and therefore no longer matter. In simple terms, market risk then is not diversifiable, because once you hold the market portfolio, there's no way to diversify further. What drives returns are risk, but rational investors can remove the idiosyncratic risk through diversification. Hence, what matters for returns in the CAPM therefore is just the market risk (which you refered to as systemic risk, but that term actually means something else). That's why under CAPM, the returns are driven by the asset correlation with the market. EDIT: The CAPM model does not put any explicit assumptions on the number of assets available, hence the model does not require an infinite number of assets. However, the derivation is based on the decision to add an asset to an already well-diversified portfolio, i.e. adding an asset to the market portfolio. Nevertheless, if only a handful of assets exist, then it might not be possible to diversify away all idiosyncratic risk. In that case, the CAPM does not work, because it implicity assumes enough assets exist, since it assumes a well-diversified portfolio exists to which you can add an asset. In such a case idiosyncratic risk may become relevant. Such considerations are unlikely to be relevant in practice though. It is difficult to put a number on how many assets are necessary for idiosyncratic risk to be diversified away completely. Often, a number that is mentioned is 30-40 assets. The number required in practice is usually very realistic and far below infinity. The number of assets required for idiosyncratic risk to be completely diversified away becomes larger if assets are more correlated with each other or very volatile. Lastly, an asset with such high idiosyncratic risk that no investor would want to add it to their portfolio cannot exist in equilibrium, because supply of the asset could never equal demand.
