Tires will change the ride more than anything else, including changing the actual frame of the bike. The stock tires on your bike are very durable but also very stiff and harsh riding. They feature thick casings and steel beads to hold the tire on the wheel. Nicer tires have more supple casings and lighter Kevlar beads (often referred to as "folding tires" because the tire can be folded flat, unlike ones with steel beads). High end tires such as Grand Bois, Schwalbe, Panaracer, Pacenti or Compass have very supple casings which turn results in a much smoother ride. Your bike can take just about any 700c tire. I'd strongly suggest something in the 30-38mm wide range. This will give you plenty of cushion but still be light enough that you won't feel like you're riding a tractor. Expect to spend $70-120 for a set of nice tires. The Panaracer Pasela Tour Guard in 35mm width is readily available and can be had for ~$40/each and is a nice mix of durability, lightweight, price and comfort. Clipless pedals and shoes are going to be more comfortable and safer. Cycling shoes are like any other pair of shoes: what works for one person may not work for another. Try on several pairs. Like good running shoes, they should be snug but not tight. One tip (and this applies to all shoes): don't try them on in the morning. Your feet swell as the day goes by, always best to try shoes on at the end of the day. As for pedals there are numerous clipless pedal systems. Some people swear by one brand over others. I've ridden several brands and worked on pretty much all of them. They're all largely variations on the same theme, I wouldn't worry too much about one brand over another. Saddles are also highly personal and costs can be as little as $20 or as high as $300+. I've worked with World Champion professional racers who are perfectly fine with riding cheap $20 saddles and I also know casual cyclists who absolutely swear by their expensive Brooks/Berthoud/Selle Italia/etc. Price really is no indicator of comfort. Replacing saddles is a pretty simple process and a good shop will take the time to let you test ride several different models. Do ask what their return policy is on saddles. A saddle which might feel fine on a short ride could become unbearable after a couple of hours. Handlebars are a tougher one to fix. Most road bikes have drop handlebars which offer more hand positions and are more ergonomic. However, you really can't easily swap out handlebars as this requires new shifters and brake levers and that gets quite expensive. A simpler, less expensive solution are bar ends (example: $URL$ These bolt to the end of the handlebar and help put your wrists in a more ergonomic position and provide you with an additional position to put your hands. You could also swap out the straight bars for a set with more hand positions and more swept back hand positions. You can see several examples at: $URL$ You will probably want to work with a shop on this as you may also need a different length stem. Beyond this you start getting into things like replacing wheels which will cost a lot of money and result in very minimal returns. Ditto for brakes and shifters. 

The nut is most likely suffering from galvanic corrosion in which case penetrating oil won't work because penetrating oil does nothing to break the chemical bond holding the two parts together. Instead of penetrating oil you can try a mild acid (think lemon juice or vinegar) which might help eat away at the bonds without damaging the finish on your fork. The wood block method descried by biker12 is the safest solution. 

It impacts weight distribution which in turn can impact handling. It also impacts front center. Bike geometry is more complicated than people think. I hear people all the time say a frame with a 57cm top tube will have more reach than a frame with a 56cm top tube. This isn't necessarily true because of the seat tube angle. Team mechanics usually rely on a form similar to this one: $URL$ When a team switches bike manufacturers or a rider needs a new bike built up we'll pull out this sheet and use it to assemble the bike. The most important numbers are the distance form the center of the BB axle to the top of the center of the saddle and also the horizontal distance from the tip of the saddle to a line drawn straight up though the center of the BB axle. These two numbers determine where your butt is in relation to the pedals. The next most important numbers are saddle to bar reach and horizontal drop from saddle to bars. The chart above shows saddle to bar distance being measured to the stem clamp but most pro mechanics I've seen prefer to measure to brake hoods to account for differences in forward reach from one bar to another (important if switch bar brands) The important thing is to figure out the position the rider needs to be in and adapt the bike to that and not the other way around. Even if you're not a pro racer it's handy to have one of these forms filled out. It's surprising how even a minor change can have a major impact. I've known more than a few riders who developed knee pain after switching shoes or pedals. Turned out the new shoes/pedals were a few mm thinner/thicker than the old models and they failed to adjust their saddle height accordingly resulting in strain on the knees. 

You will need to respace the rear end of the frame to 130mm. This should be done by a bike shop and even better by a frame builder. 10 speed cassettes and modern hubs are spaced to fit 130mm frames. It's not an expensive or difficult process but does take a certain degree of skill and specialized tools. Yes, you would need to build a new wheel to convert to 10 speed. Your wheel uses a freewheel hub. This means the cassette cluster also houses the freewheel/clutch mechanism. Modern 10 speed drivetrains use a cassette hub in which the freewheel/clutch mechanism is part of the hub and the gear cluster simply slides onto the hub. You can still find 27" rims, especially in Japan. Unless the rims are very worn out I'd probably stick with the original rims and just change the spokes/hub. Panaracer still make some nice 27" tires. Ideally, you would also replace the chainrings. Modern 10 speed drivetrains really work best with the special chainrings designed for them. These rings have cut away teeth, pins and ramps designed to help the chain move smoothly from one ring to other (especially from small to large). You can often buy a crankset with rings for not much more than just the rings themselves. You will need a new chain. 10 speed drivetrains require a much narrower chain. 

You answered your own question: it's not sporting behavior. It's also considered to be deeply unprofessional. You might gain an advantage that one time but after that everyone would be gunning for you. Also every rider has bad luck at some point. The professional courtesy you extend to a rider will one day be returned to you. 

One last note: the 27" Araya rims you mention are almost certainly a hookless design. Most rims have a small lip design to help hold the tire on when it's inflated to high pressures. These rims almost certainly do not. I would advise against inflating the tires past 75 psi/5.2 bar. 

Just off the picture I'd say it's fine. Aluminum is more durable than many people think (you know they build airplanes out of the stuff?!) That said, I would carefully look at the areas where the tubes are welded together. Use a bright light and look for any small, hairline cracks in the paint. Most of the aluminum bikes I've seen fail usually snap at the welds (outside of horrible crashes of course) 

Bottecchia are an Italian brand who sell everything from BMX bikes to professional racing bikes. Here in the US the brand is probably best known for being ridden by Greg LeMond in his historic 1989 Tour de France win. It's hard to say the exact model of this bike. It's a low end model from the 1970s "bike boom". The crankset appears to be a Nervar cottered steel unit. The shifters and derailleurs look like low end Huret models. Both are typical of early 70s bikes. Depending on your budget you could almost certainly do better than this. Bikes have made tremendous gains since the late 80s. Not only have they gotten lighter but they've also become more reliable. I would look for something more recent. 

Most likely situation is the wheel isn't full seated in the frame. With the bike standing upright on the ground loosen the wheel bolts and lean a bit on the bike which will force the wheel all the way into the dropouts. While still leaning on the bike tighten the wheel bolts. Be sure to alternate bolts when tightening. A lot of times people tighten one side first and the torque causes the other side of the axle to slide slightly out of the dropout resulting in a wobble. 

A lower gearing range. This means a smaller chainring in front and bigger cogs on the rear wheel. Batman nicely outlines this in his post. An external power source such as an electric motor. 

100% Clincher. Nobody makes a production bike with tubulars - way too much of a liability issue. An improperly glued tire is extremely dangerous. Also gluing tubulars on is a very time consuming process which isn't possible in a mass manufacturing environment. 

It's a fairly generic, machine built wheelset with Bontrager branding. They're almost certainly OEM which means you won't be able to by a replacement set. Most likely Alex or similar rims. As you noticed, they're not the lightest wheels out there. A set such as this would typically retail for well under $300. The Shimano R501 or Mavic Aksium One are both good replacement wheels to look at in this price range. Either would be a nice upgrade without breaking the bank. There are some fantastic deals to be had on wheels these days. 

One thing to keep in mind is that a hub that feels a tiny bit loose when out of the bike will likely have no play once you put it in the frame/fork. The clamping force on the axle nuts will tighten things up, removing the excess play. 

What kind of frame is it? These days many frames have a replaceable derailleur hanger. The derailleur hanger is the little bit of metal that the rear derailleur bolts onto. The hanger is then in turn bolted to the frame. Often times the factory doesn't apply any grease where the hanger and frame interface. This dry interface can often result in creaking, especially when a lot of torque is applied (like when you're in a low gear). Unbolt the derailleur from the hanger and then unbolt the hanger from the frame. Apply a thin layer of grease to where the two meet and reassembly the bike.
