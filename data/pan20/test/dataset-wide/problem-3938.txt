I have asked this question on MSE, but besides earning a TumbleWeed award, there was no feedback. My question is, where I can download all optimal tours of the TSPLib95 library? I already did a lot of googling and found that the original resource of the University of Heidelberg hasn't been upated since 2008 and has not all optimal tours available. Also the distance calculations of the X-ray problems are hard to understand/find online. I would be a bit surprised if the standard collection of TSP problems were not maintained and available anymore; I am currently checking new heuristics for the TSP problem and would like to be able to provide results that are based on a collection of standard instances. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

I want to draw finite planar graphs in certain canonical ways. My idea is to use a stereographic projection of the convex hull of points placed on the unit sphere in a way, that the graph induced by the edges and corners of their 3D convex hull is isomorphic to the planar graph to be visualized. A further requirement, to make the polyhedron somehow canonical, would be that it be optimal in some respect, e.g. that it has maximal volume or surface are and, that the center of projection has maximal distance to the nearest face. 

With the above construction, we have created a negative cycle of length $-2k-2+4\ < -2$ that contains two non-tree edges. The shortest cycle containing only a single non-tree edge and both negative edges is however $\ > (-2k)\ +\ (2k-2)\ +\ (2) \ge\ 0$. This demonstrates that negative cycles may go undetected with the $MST$-heuristic; it may however still be useful as a fast sufficient check for negative cycles. 

When investigating the properties of least detours of edges in complete, weighted graphs, I noticed an interesting phenomenon in the visualization of graphs where the nodes correspond to points in the Euclidean plane and edge-weights to Euclidean distances between points. Out of curiosity, I depicted the edges $e_{ij}$, that satisfy $$\ k^*\notin \lbrace i,j\rbrace\ \wedge\ \forall k\notin \lbrace i,j\rbrace:\ \|e_{ik^*}\|+\|e_{k^*j}\|\ \le\ \|e_{ik}\|+\|e_{kj}\| \quad \implies \|e_{ik^*}\|\gt \|e_{ij}\|\ \lor\ \|e_{k^*j}\|\gt \|e_{ij}\|$$ Here is a visualization of an instance with 3000 points: 

The reason for asking is that I supect, that the calculation of the initial vertex weights is subjected to constraints derived from the weight of individual edges and maybe also non-negativity constraints, e.g., letting $\pi_i$ denote the weight of vertex $v_i$ and \omega_{ij} the weight of edge $e_{ij}$, $\max \sum_i\pi_i$ $0\le\pi_i\quad\forall i$ $\pi_i+\pi_j\le\omega_{ij}\quad\forall \lbrace{i,j\rbrace} $ and the essence of my question is whether constraints based on $k$-tuples of adjacent edges and maybe dropping the non-negativity constraints would leverage. the potential of vertex weights. Example $k=2$: Hamilton cycles are special (i.e. connected) two-regular spanners and consequently it seems more appropriate to determine the vertex weights $\pi_i$ via the weight-sum of pairs of edges that are adjacent to $v_i$, i.e. $\max\sum_i\pi_i$ $\pi_h+2\pi_i+\pi_j\ \le\ \omega_{hi}+\omega_{ij}\quad\forall\lbrace h,i,j\rbrace$ and analogous for $k\gt 2$ In the $k=2$ case it is also tempting to suspect that the set of edges $e_{ij}$ that satisfy $\omega_{ij}-\pi_i-\pi_j\ \lt 0$ constitiute to the minimum weight perfect matching for graphs with an even number of vertices. It is further tempting that the resulting vertex weights yield the graph, that is critically free of negative cycles. 

today I found the following paper, which comes closest to what I had hoped for: $URL$ In it incarnations of IP/ILP formulations for certain non-linear integer optimizations can be found, however not one specifically dedicated to the integer factorization problem. So I supply it as an answer in hope for better/further suggestions. 

As there seem to be no kown formulas for calculating elements of arg max and, as the existence of such a formula would seem to come as a surprise, I'd like to present such a formula for discussion. Provided the formula isn't demonstrated entirely wrong and interest is expressed, I can also provide ideas for proving its correctness for certain classes of functions. Before presenting the formula, some clarification regarding terminology is necessary. Especially different flavors of argument-sets need to be defined; to this end I introduce new operators with the following meaning: $$ \begin{align} & \essSup(f_{|\Omega})\quad := \inf\left\{y\in\mathbb{R}\ |\ \mu\left(f_{|\Omega}^{-1}\left(y,+\infty\right)\right)=0\right\} \\ & \valArg(f_{|\Omega},y) := \left\{x\in\Omega\ |\ f(x)=y\right\} \\ & \essArg(f_{|\Omega},y) := \left\{x\in\overline{\Omega}\ |\ lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\essSup\left(f_{|\Omega\cap U_{\epsilon}(x)}\right)=y\right\} \end{align}$$ and it is the second set of arguments, that is compatible with the formula of Kantorowitsch and also applicable in cases, where the definition of $\valArg$ is too strict and renders $\valArg\left(f_{|\Omega},\essSup(f_{|\Omega})\right)$ empty. Now, assuming $$\begin{align} 0 & \lt f_{|\Omega} \lt +\infty \\ 0 & \lt g_{|\Omega} \lt +\infty\quad \wedge\quad x\not = y \Leftrightarrow g(x) \not = g(y) \end{align} $$ a candidate formula for an essential argument to a function's essential supremum is this one: 

What you are actually looking for, is the Spigot Algorithm which is also known as "droplet algorithm". That algorithm has been described a few years ago in the german "Spektrum der Wissenschaft" and should thus also have been described in the "Scientific American". Especially the algorithm for $e$ is known and an implementation in R can be found here. 

Sorry for the coarse description of the ideas, but maybe they can serve as source of inspiration for others. 

It is a well known fact, that ellipses can be defined as $$\{x\in\mathbb{R}^2\ \ |\ \ \|x-A\|+\|x-B\|-\|B-A\|=e\in\mathbb{R}_0^+;\ A,B\in\mathbb{R}^2\}$$ 

To be more concrete: it would be an obvious idea to interpret the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the real instance as the complex zeroes or poles of some complex function and then try to express simple closed tours e.g. as certain conformal mappings of the unit circle. As it is often the case, that a real-analytic problem is easier solved in the complex plane, it seems justified to put some hope into an easier solution of the ETSP by transferring it to the complex plane or, maybe even to quaternian space. 

Now, just out of curiosity, I would like to know the "story" behind those "celebrations". Is there a common understanding of what is worth celebrating and who are/were the persons that honored theorems or algorithms with the celebrated attribute. In this respect, the last two listed theorems are interesting due to their authorship, resp. date. 

Refering only to the question as formulated in the title and, ignoring the clarification that aims at giving a precise definition, the answer is yes, namely the non-smooth Reuleaux Triangle if one is willing to accept the Envelope Curve as the curve that is generated by the rolling curve. Further restrictions are of course that in the initial position a corner of the rolling curve must coincide with a corner of the containing curve and, that the rolling curve must be a copy of the containing curve that is shrunk by an integer multiple of 3 in the case of the Reuleaux triangle. Smooth Reuleaux triangles will fail to generate a scaled copy of itself because the envelope is an offset-curve, which in turn means that a constant value is subtracted from all curvature radii, whereas are a scaled copy would require that all radii are divided by a constant value. 

I am currently working on a problem that may be interpreted as recovering an unknown function from its Radon transform. Unfortunately I don't have any background in Radon transform, but need to quickly get what I need for solving my problem. The questions are: 

So the essential question would be, under what conditions such a mapping exists and whether it can be calculated exactly or to arbitrary precision. 

rethinking the suggestion of Joonas Ilmavirta, to use characteristic functions of the convex sets, the following recipe seems to yield a method to calculate the integral of a function over the outcome of some set theoretic combination of a (finite) collection of compact regions of the respective euclideans space: 

I recently faced the problem of efficiently approximating a very large set of data points and, neither having a model of the empiric function, nor of the error distribution, my method of choice would have been a least squares fit with B-Splines. The resulting system of equations would however have been forbiddingly large and a peculiarity of my problem was, that the value of the approximating function had only to be determined for a small set of clustered arguments, which means, that there were large intervals, where the function would never have to be evaluated. My idea was then to approximate the sets of datapoints, that are inside the support of the B-Spline basis function, by an individual polynomial. The evaluation of empiric function would then be done via a convex combination of the approximating polynomials that are associated to those supports of the B-Spline basis functions, that contain the argument point. The weights for the convex combination would be obtained from an evaluation of the B-Spline basis functions for the argument. The advantages of the method would be that there is no need to completely determine the approximating function if only a few function values are needed and, the effect of outliers is limited to a small neighborhood, which could be desirable, if an approximation of shape is more important than error minimization (eg. in case of a local deformation due to damage). Question: has such a kind of approximation already been described and, where can I find information about it? 

hectoc is a puzzle, where one is given a sequence of six decimal digits and the task is to intersperse arithmetic operations from the given set $+,-,/,*$ and matching brackets $(,)$ in a way that the resulting valid arithmetic expression yields $100$. The example on the homepage illustrates the task: $123456\mapsto 1+(2+3+4)*(5+6)=100$ 

Is there a way to integrate over the intersection of a finite collection of convex regions, using only the definition of the regions (i.e. without actually calculating the intersections)? The concrete problem I have, is to integrate over the intersection of two ellipses and a parallelogram, all centered at the origin (the ellipses and the parallelogram also depend on additional parameters). While it would be possible to calculate the intersection, it lacks elegance and mathematical beauty and I wonder whether there is something analogous to lagrange multipliers. edit In view of the answers and comments, I see the need of stressing, that calculating the intersection of regions refers to determining the intersection of the respective point sets of the given convex regions and not to determining the measure (i.e. area or volume) of the intersection. The motivation is to avoid tedious calculations of the intersection of region boundaries in order to determine the region-intersection via a description of its boundary. 

Is there a name for linear transformations of the plane, that make $4$ points in general convex configuration co-circular, with the biggest circle through those points and, how can they be determined for a specific sample of such a quadruple of points? edit: In reply to Michael Renardy's comment, I add the further restrictions, that the eigenvalues of the linear transformations shall be positive and one of them shall be $1$. 

Yesterday I needed to do some calculations with circles and "ventured" to calculate the arc length via the $\int{\sqrt{1+\left(f'(x)\right)^2}}$ formula and was baffled to see that in the case of unit half-circles that amounts to $\ ds := \sqrt{1+\left(f'(x)\right)^2} = \frac{1}{f(x)}$ Stuffing that differential equation in WA yields the four solutions $f(x) = \pm\sqrt{-2 c_1 x - c_1^2 - x^2 + 1}\ $and $f(x) = \pm\sqrt{2 c_1 x - c_1^2 - x^2 + 1}\ $ 

My motivation is to identify "fat" triangles, for which it is guaranteed, that their corners are elements of the convex hull of some finite planar point sets. 

There are also articles available online, that are related to that topic: $URL$ $URL$ and a lot more are reported when feeding "distribution of vertex degrees in triangulations" into a popular search engine. 

The problem is essentially equivalent to asking for the complexity of calculating the vector $$ \mathcal{V} := \{ \mathcal{A}_0\cap \mathcal{x}, \mathcal{A}_1\cap \mathcal{x},\ ...,\ \mathcal{A}_{mn+m+n}\cap\mathcal{x} \}$$ where the $\mathcal{A}_i$ are the sets of indices corresponding to the non-zero entries of the $i$-th row of $A$ and analogously, $\mathcal{x}$ corresponds to the non-zero entries of $x$. The number required multiplications in the general case (i.e. if that the entries of $x$ are not restricted to $0$ and $1$), is then $$\sum_{i=0}^{mn+m+n} \mathcal{card}(\mathcal{A}_i\cap\mathcal{x}) $$ whereas an upper bound for the number of additions (the complexity you are interested in) is $$\left(\sum_{i=0}^{mn+m+n} \mathcal{card}(\mathcal{A}_i\cap\mathcal{x})\right)\ -\ (mn+m+n+1) $$ $$ $$ The complexity of the problem depends however also on further assumptions, e.g. 

Can every Halin graph be visualized as the union of a planar, strictly convex polygon with its Voronoi Diagram? It is true, that every union of a strictly convex planar polygon with its Voronoi diagram corresponds to a Halin graph], but is the converse also true? 

You could try to repeatedly remove the vertex, for which the sum of distances to other vertices is minimal, until you are left with S vertices. 

The description of Fermat's method seems to indicate that he is the original source of the technique of reducing the problem of removing square roots (or even general radicals) from equations to solving a linear system of equations, where the monomials of radicals are the unknowns. Question: what kind of problem did Fermat exactly solve and how has that influenced later work of other mathematicians; apparently Moivre solved the general case? 

Let the edge set of a Optimal k-Tour Spanner of a graph $G$ be equal to the edges of $G$ that lie on at least one optimal tour through exactly $3<k<n$ distinct vertices of $G$. I would like to know, whether such spanners have already been investigated and, specifically: 

That heuristic manages to restore a full upper triangular square-matrix and thus seems a good starting point for further improvements. 

This question is in the vein of my former question Fast Comparing of the Volume of Simplices Defined by Sidelengths, but it has a different twist, that may allow for an easier answer: 

Given: $G:=\{V= \{v_1,\ ...\ v_n\},E\subset V\times V\}, n<\infty$, a symmetric complete, simple graph $w:=\ \ E \ni e_{ij}\mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$, a weight function for the edges of $G$ $K:=\{c_1,\ ...\ c_m\},\ 2\le m\ll n$, a set of colors to be assigned to the vertices of $G$ Question: Are there any algorithms known, that color the vertices in $V$ with colors from $K$ in a way that minimizes some norm of the vector of nearest color-neighbor distances; i.e. if $c(j)$ is the color assigned to $v_j$ and, $\mu_{ik} := \min\limits_{c(v_j)=c_k}w_{ij}$ the least weight of the edges that connect vertex $v_i$ to a vertex $v_j$ of color $c_k$, are algorithms known, that minimize $\|(\mu_{1,1}\ ,\ ...,\ \mu_{1,k}\ ,\ ...,\ \mu_{n,1},\ ...,\ \mu_{n,k})\|$? In the context of this question a vertex is considered to be none if its neighbors, but feel free to assume the contrary.
