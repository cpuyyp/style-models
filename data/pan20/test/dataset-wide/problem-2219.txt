First, a minor correction in OP's understanding of the grouping In the ATP World Tour Finals with regards to the first two seeds. 

On top of this statement, Winter also lays out the sequences of Chamberlain dunking from the foul line as an eyewitness at approximately 3:50 in this video Wilt himself even confirmed stories of himself dunking from the foul line when on February 12,1989 in a Los Angeles Times piece, Wilt is quoted saying: 

So, this is indeed not random, but the systematic selection method for determining the 1st seed being placed in the first group, and the 2nd seed being placed in the second group. From this point on however, The 2017 ATP Rulebook does not prescribe a specific order of play in which the seeds of each group must play, nor on which day of the tournament the seeds will play, but only states that each seed must play 1 match against the other players in his group; 3 matches in total. Traditionally yes, the way the matches have been broken down is that within Group 1 and 2's first round of matches, the (1) or (2) seed will play the lowest seed (7) or (8), and the two middle seeds will play each other; (3) plays (5) or (4) plays (6). The 2017 ATP World Tour Finals follows this format as well! Indeed, it appears the 2013 World Tour Finals is the only instance in which this format was not followed, and the reasoning for this is ultimately conjecture. However, we can deduce from the absence of Official ATP Rule direction on the matter that the order of play is ultimately up to the discretion of the venue hosting the event. Also, as long as each player plays the other three in their respective groups, the event is still abiding by ATP rules, so the tournament organizers really have the ability to schedule the order of play however they see fit, perhaps with player feedback. The rationale behind this sort of information is rarely disclosed to the public though, and is shrouded in doubt and ambiguity; as seen with this year's controversy in Rafael Nadal supposedly asking tournament organizers to push back his day of play. Ultimately however, the ATP has produced no official order of play that The World Tour Finals must abide by and has left this up to tournament organizers and directors. 

Surely it would what most sports people see immediately... Hall of Fame. Except not. It appears from a search of the time and name on Google, that it's the name of the track, and thus the track record? $URL$ shows: 

(In fact Sweden's second tier has a higher average attendance than Norway's Get-ligaen!) So the objective answer appears to lay in the lack of participation (at least at organized levels) in Norway. And that likely also lines up with a lower degree of funding and overall support. Why lowered interest? Seems a part of it may lie in increased interest in alternative sports. Norway has a big history in skiing and even speed skating, one that puts them atop the historic worldwide medal count for the winter Olympics (despite no hockey medals). Additionally, there is a large interest in soccer in Norway, which may be well shared by Sweden, but not as much so in Finland. 

It appears this page on the DDTB-tennis website may be the path towards more details for Germany. Google translate suggests that it says: 

After much research, and with the help of the Wayback Machine, I was able to compile a list of pdf's for most of the rulebooks since 2001. To understand where we're getting these rulebooks from, we must first dive into the history of the ATP's websites, with respective rulebooks. The chronology of the internet presence of what is currently the "ATP World Tour" goes a little something like this: 

The article is based on a source-less example which narrates Chamberlain's "unorthodox" free throws: 

One possible term to describe this phenomenon is a "Stand-in." The usage for this term is more common in eSports than traditional sports, but it nonetheless holds a similar connotation. 

After watching many Wilt Chamberlain dunk compilations and reading many articles on The Big Dipper, I can say with a large degree of certainty that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk the ball from the free throw line. For the second question, if by "proof" the OP means "video evidence" then I'm afraid it simply cannot be found if it even exists. On the other hand, in terms of proof, a strong case can be built that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk from the foul line via Witness Testimony and Wilt's Self Proclamation. On November 28th, 1956 the "Toledo Blade" (a Northwestern Ohio newspaper) published this article which details the "Big Seven" conference's 2 rule changes based on then sophomore Wilt chamberlain: 

Are there any complications, other than the player concerns of adding more games, that would hinder this scheduling change option? 

Though we all do certainly struggle with all of them (even regressing to failing at the basics occasionally after many years of improving golf)... enough to drive (haha) us nuts plenty! Nothing to feel embarrassed about (though we all do feel it occasionally when we hit one of those ugly shots, even as we're all in the same boat). Hopefully shots like this one will remind you it's natural! But that's an idea of what will drive you nuts. And you'll likely seek clubs to help as they match those stages of peak frustration. But you're really fine to give it a try. The exact number or the cost of the clubs at the start don't mean anything at all. You don't need a seven gear Lamborthink with 100 settings to learn to drive. It probably just makes it harder. Likewise with golf. And then SW\Driver\LW will likely be the two or three clubs that you look to seek out sooner than the other irons. The missing irons are just used for more precise distance selection later down the line. You'll already soon be working into the basic idea... the longer the shot, the higher on your list you'll look towards for a club. A 3-hybrid goes a lot further when hit solid than a 9 iron. But a 7 iron vs an 8 iron is (for example) the difference of hitting it 150 yards versus 140 yards. Just not a giant issue worth troubling with until you can hit them solid fairly consistently, as you won't be able to apply it helpfully. Either has a fair shot of getting near or even on a green from that range. For most golfers their first few range sessions and rounds, it'll be more about finding a club or two you feel most comfortable hitting. Many seem to really take a liking to a 7 iron, but each has their own. Whatever you feel gives you the best chance of hitting it good, even if it doesn't go quite as far, is your best friend... both in terms of using fewer shots on the course... and in terms of making it enjoyable. And then work into more and more clubs as you improve and you find need to start tuning the distance aspects. But it sounds like you're ready to give it a go! Hope you hit em well! 

So basically once the batsmen complete the first run (which is the only run required to win) then the match ends. If the ball goes to the boundary then that won't count, and therefore the batsman will only be credited 1 run not 4. However if the ball goes to the boundary before they complete the first run then 4 runs will be given to the batsman (and the team score also), since once it reaches the boundary the match ends. 

Now if you are attempting to run out the batsman a fielder wants to hit the stumps. A ball that bounces actually takes longer to get to the wickets since the bounce slows the ball and the trajectory is slightly further. However a bouncing ball has more accuracy than one on the full. It is harder to hit the stumps on the full than a bouncing ball. This decision is a split second decision. Now as far as a returning the ball just to reset the game (no run out) a fielder should throw the ball on the full, and not hard either. A bouncing ball may make it more difficult for the wicketkeeper to catch and may risk overthrows. As for damaging the ball Law 42 (FAIR AND UNFAIR PLAY) has a clause: 

Although this may put the definition of "professional" in question, there exists a North American club team that's existence does date before the Cincinnati Red Stockings. Some lesser known history, there exists a sport in North America that has been around for many centuries. That sport is lacrosse. Believed to have originally been played by the Native American Iroquois people, historians have traced the general sport of lacrosse back to the 1100's.1 The game was predominately played by those Native American people in what would become the North-Eastern United States, and lower parts of Ontario and Quebec. Explorers and missionaries have recorded details about the game as early as 1637.2 As time wore on, the people of Canada grew fond of the game and began to play it themselves. According to the "Canadian Encyclopedia": 

After collating the Eagles 2004 Roster with the Eagles 2017-2018 Roster, There were no returning players. The method performed to calculate this was to prioritize the 14 years that have advanced since the 2004 roster. Using this criteria, we can eliminate any players that were over the age of 26 on the 2004 roster due to the striking unlikelihood of any players over the age of 40 still playing other than the Kickers and Punters (both were checked, and both retired before the 2017-2018 season). So, we are left a handful of players 26 or younger from the 2004 roster. Of the 32 players from the 2004 Eagles roster aged 26 or younger, none of them even made it to the 2017-2018 NFL season. In fact, most of the players from that great 2004 team didn't even make it out of the 2000's. 

In terms of minimum clubs for the. driving range, it's whatever you want to work at. I've taken One before, even after having golfed a couple decades. A single iron or wood is plenty to learn and reverse the swing until you're getting good contact, and even after that you only need to practice whatever clubs you'll be seeking to use during the round. Won't hurt to take them all and give each occasional tries, just to find what you like and are good using, more than anything. But no club is a wonder drug, so it can be helpful to remember not to become too focused on what club you're using on the range when learning. Changing clubs every time you struggle on a few shots is a welcome distraction... but boy if golf isn't about perservering and patience! Remember hour very first goal at golf is to just get good at hitting the ball. It's not easy! So it doesn't hurt to just work at it with one or two clubs. So you're set for that! No need to practice any of the clubs you don't have yet on the driving range until you've decided they're going to be helpful and needed on your round of golf. You also have a reasonable range to try around the putting green or on a pitch and putt. You may well even be content at a full layout with those to begin with. Heck, I've played entire rounds on a full-sized source with just a putter! Though that's a good way to break one! (and good luck on holes that require you to hit over water... or out of bunkers!) But many a kid has started with a putter, a wedge, and a 7 iron, or a putter, a wedge, and a driver, and done just fine for a first time. You don't need a lot, and you are already fine in that account. In terms of clubs you may be wishing to look towards sooner than later: Perhaps a more lofted sand or lob wedge, as getting out of deeper bunkers can be very difficult (even for many longtime players). Generally for bunkers near the green (and at times even those in the fairway) you'll likely use wedges rather than hybrids, as the angle is more favorable. Sand and lob wedges have additional loft that will aid you in getting the ball out. Additionally the "bounce" of a sand wedge is designed specifically designed to help the club rebound up in the sand, and help ball leave the bunker, instead of digging the club into the ground. It is most likely the next club most would look to because of its noticeable benefits. Most beginner's I've played with have enjoyed at least borrowing a coplayer's SW for a shot or two by the time they've played a handful of rounds. And most go that way for their next club purchase. In addition, once you have some consistency hitting the ball, a driver or normal (non-hybrid) 3 wood may be helpful to adding distance consistently off the tee on longer holes (mostly on par 4s and 5s). With the giant driver face many drivers have these days, you may also find it easier to hit than some of the hybrids. And once you get decent at hitting it, a lot of the fun for most comes in hitting it far. So often that is an early purchase for people too. But, neither club is particularly vital right off the bat, you don't need a ton to start with. The frustrations of golf for many seems to sort of fall loosely into a progression of: 

Tex Winter (a rival coach at Kansas state) seems to affirm Wilt's ability to dunk from the foul line by stating: 

They enjoyed it so much that a few decades later in 1856, enthusiasts banded together and formed Canada's first ever lacrosse club the "Montreal Lacrosse Club." 3 Now, it was around this time that the Prince of Wales traveled to Canada and grasped the merit of holding sporting exchanges between Britain and Canada. As a result, tours began developing in Britain pitting the Native American Khanawake players from Montreal against white gentleman amateurs from Scotland, Ireland, and England.4 It was then, in 1867, that one of the first ever "professional" sports teams/ clubs was formed. The Montreal Lacrosse club, then led by team captain W.B Johnson, began organizing matches in the British nations primarily as a profit making enterprise. The team was comprised of 16 Khanawake players who were each paid $25 dollars for their play (roughly $1600 dollars today).5 Given OP's qualification of "professional" as " (a team) that paid its players as professionals." These Khanawake players would've fit the category. As for the club still being in existence it is complicated. The club itself is not in operation like the Boston Red Socks are, but it exists in an almost ceremonial way. This article outlines the 150 year anniversary of the Montreal Lacrosse Club's existence. The anniversary was celebrated by an exhibition game between the sports two oldest clubs, one of which being Montreal Lacrosse Club. So yes the club is still in existence, but does not operate as team which is comprised of players who are paid a salary by it. Sources: 

There has long been team discomfort in Thursday night and international games because teams have a reduced rest period. A 2 bye-weeks schedule was attempted in 1993, but was dropped, it seemed in large part due to the excessive disruption within each team's schedule. Thoughts of expanding to an 18 game schedule (likely removing two preseason games) were hinted at by Roger Goodell during the 2016 season, but were tabled for the time being. The big barrier was likely player agreement given the increase in games played and wear-and-tear on the bodies, but an additional issue was that the scheduling would become imbalanced relative to the symmetric format used now. However, if the NFL instead added 4 extra weeks to the season made up of 3 games and a second bye week, it would 

Based on the fivethirtyeight dataset (and hand-analysis of 2016-current), suggestions are that the Pacers became the 79th series loser to outscore the series winner in an official playoff series (1 of those is a BAA playoffs matchup in 1947... there were also 8 ABA matchups, but those are not officially recognized as NBA data). However, the series marked the greatest disparity in 59 years, way back since the (St Louis) Hawks returned the favor to the (Minneapolis) Lakers.

Wizards lost to CLE Cavaliers 2-4, but outscored by 1 points (Note I cannot absolutely ensure the lack of errors... the dataset doesn't indicate where playoff series start and end.... which happened to be a problem in the 56 season, when MNL and STL actually played 4 playoff games in a row.... but turns out the first was a division tiebreaker! I fixed that issue, but there could feasibly be similar small errors, either in computation, or in the dataset itself) (Apologies for team monikers like Seattle Thunder, but it's how the set was laid out to maintain franchise records) And for those wondering: 

Which means throwing the ball down at the wicket (which is much harder than the grass) could damage the ball. The umpire may warn the player (and captain) of such behaviour according to this rule. 

In the 4 majors of Tennis, the men in the singles competition need to play the best of 5 sets. From what I have seen, is that if a player plays a 5 setter and wins, they are going to have less of a chance of winning the next match than if they had won by 3 sets (just my observation). This is considering more about endurance, stamina and fatigue rather than skill or who they play against in the next round. Have there been such analysis done and if so what is the probabilities. Like saying that the same player against the same opponent in the next round is a % greater chance of losing if they played a 5 set match beforehand instead of a 3 set match. 

And how does this skill vary during the season? For decades we've heard the presentation that polls are biased, especially in preseason, and lazily voted on. Does empirical data generally bear this out? 

as the track record for the 1500. And $URL$ indicates the current Olympic trials are at Hayward. If some are like me were just as unclear on some of the others, seems they could be: WR: World Record AR: America Record MR: Meet Record (at the location... this specific competition\event?) WL: World Leader (for the year) AL: America Leader (for the year) OS: Olympic something or Official Speed??? Why use the quirky track abbreviation I know not. But I can't get the links you gave to show the records anymore, they're all blank. So maybe this whole topic is gone to history 8-) 

Watching golf today, the commentators were emphasizing that finishing with a good 18th hole was critical towards the next day's play. Got me wondering if there's any statistical evidence of that? Whether it's a basketball player finishing with good points, a golfer finishing with birdie(s), a batter finishing with a hit (or pitcher with a strikeout), whatever... is there any data to show what happens? I could also imagine a player coming off a previous roll to end a round/game/match... coming back and having a letdown snowball because an early stumble feels worse given the heavier euphoria coming into the day. Seems like a lot of these sports clichéd beliefs end up being hard to quantify or blatantly disproven, but wonder if this one is any different?
