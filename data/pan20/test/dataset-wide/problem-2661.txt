A priori truth is a knowledge obtained before and independent from experience. The issue of a priori truth for any kind of science has first been investigated by Aristotle in Book 1 of his Metaphysics. From today's point of view the only a priori truths of science are the rules of logic and the syllogisms of logic: The law of non-contradiction has already been stated by Aristotle. Kant - deeply impressed by Newtonian mechanics - claimed that natural science like Newtonian mechanics also disposes of a priori knowledge. See his work Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786). Today his claim is rejected by the scientific community. Today's science is much more cautious. As you write, science always starts by observation and experiment. All general knowledge is considered hypothetical. It can be confirmed by observation but not proved. It can can always be refuted by new experiments. Then the underlying theory has to be improved or replaced by a new theory. Hence the only a priori truths of science belong to the domain of logic. 

No, proofs do not exist for the hypothesis that we have been created by an other being – besides our human parents :-) Philosophy of religion has used the so called watchmaker argument: If one finds a watch, then one assumes that a watchmaker has crafted that watch. Watches do not exist by change. Also they do not grow just by natural forces. The watchmaker argument has been stated in favour of creation by design. It should support the view that intelligent design needs an intelligent designer, i.e. the Christian god. Of course a parable like the watchmaker parable does not prove anything: … analogies prove nothing, that is quite true, but they can make one feel at home (Sigmund Freud) A scientific explanation of the development of humans and other animals has been given by the theory of evolution. Like all scientific theories also the theory of evolution operates without the concept of a creator. In addition, the theory is not based on any teleological principle which would make the whole process goal oriented. In a broader context, the severest rival of the concept of creation is the concept of self-organisation. Though, the old concept of being created by a higher being finds a revival in the concept of Mathematical Reality: We humans and our whole environment, i.e. our whole world, is a computer program with artifical intelligence. It is designed by a programmer and installed on his computer. See Chapter 10 in „Green, Brian: The Hidden Reality. Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos.“ See also Are we living in a simulation? The evidence 

The basic premise of "1" is understood, and transcends specific semiotics. If you can differentiate one thing from another to any degree, then you can grasp the basic premise of numerals, and therefore mathematics. 

Turtles my dear boy, turtles. This concern has been around since before the modern computer. Rene Desecrate contested a similar concern in his Meditations, though for him the illusion was made by a mischievous demon. We have also seen portrayals of this in "The Matrix". Unfortunately, the logical necessity for a Primary World cannot quite overcome the existence of an infinite regression. Much like aligning two mirrors towards each other, the image appears in an infinite regression. This is the plot of ##Spoiler Alert## "The Thirteenth Floor". Another example that may put the concept into perspective is the old problem in cosmology posed by the "unmoved mover" paradox. As phased jokingly by Steven Hawkins; 

While the dualist and materialist do not agree on the origins of the mind, I believe that both hold agree that it is the existence of a mind that establishes personhood. Descarte described an animal brain as a clockwork mechanism devoid of a mind. Therefore, the sheep's brain in a human's body is an animal. In the reversal, where a human brain in transplanted into a sheep, personhood could perhaps be transferred too. For a Dualists it would depend on if the mind is also transferred. For the Materialist, the mind necessarily transfers where the brain goes (if the brain maintains its functionality). This is also true for a literal "brain in the vat" scenario. However, to ask if the mind could be "downloaded" into a computer, rather than transferring the brain to a vat frames the question slightly differently. It poses little issue to the dualist, since the mind is separate from the brain, and the computer would simply replace the mechanical portion of the current role of the brain. However, to a materialist, each mind is the result of a specific brain, therefore begs the question of how the same mind could exist outside the specific brain of its origins. 

Here Leibniz reviews in an affirmative way one of King's claim. 3) Whether Leibniz' Theodicy solves the problem of evil is controversial between theists and atheists. Concerning the problem of pain I do not know whether any contemporary theologian considers King's claim a valid argument. 

That's a description on the level of neurobiology. On the opposite, "having an idea" is a description on the level of philosophy of mind. These are two different levels of explanation. Anyhow I must admit that I consider Kaye's statements a bit cluttered. I do not adhere to her use of the terms. 

IIT is a proposal to explicate the concept of consciousness by information theory. More precisely, by a mathematical formalization and a prescript how to determine the degree of consciousness of an information system. In a survey article, "Reggia, JA: The rise of machine consciousness: studying consciousness with computational models." ($URL$ compares four current approaches to study consciousness with a computational model. In characterizing IIT he writes: 

Time, space and spacetime are concepts we use in the context of physical theories to denote objects and events. According to both the Special and the General Theory of Relativity, the basic concept is spacetime, a 4-dimensional manifold. Events are points in spacetime. They are determined by 4 parameters. After choosing a coordinate system we decompose these 4 parameters into 3+1 coordinates. They denote the space where the event happens and the time, when the event happens. This fact can be taken as the meaning of the sentence "to be in time". But immediately we have to face the fact, that decomposing the 4 parameters into space and time has a certain arbitrariness due to the choice of the coordinate system. Hence the absolute statement is "to be in spacetime". Only the latter is independent from the choice of the coordinate system. While "to be in time" is a relative statement. When restricting to gravitational interactions every object which is "in spacetime" always moves through spacetime on a distinguished curve (geodetic line). This fact can be denoted as "being subject to spacetime". As a consequence my answer to your original question is: Yes, everything, which is in spacetime, is subject to spacetime. Of course there are things which are not in spacetime, e.g. laws of nature or mathematical objects or propostions. 

The deceiver is primarily a concern because Descartes acknowledges that his senses are prone to defect. So when Descartes argues that his doubting is evidence of his own self, it is more a reflection that only "the fact that thought exists" confirms existence. This is how we derive "I think, therefore I am". It is not really important whether the doubt is a programmed characteristic or not. Its that doubt inherently implies an internal consideration that is beyond that of the senses and the external world. 

I would consider this very closely aligned with Martin Heidegger's theory posed in "Being and Time". "She never achieved her authentic self; Dasein." 

I have not read Milan Kundera's "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", but I have come across it in a class. It seems quite similar to your description. I am unclear of the exact argument, but from what I recall, he draws on Nietzsche's concept of the "unbearable weight" brought on by the burden of eternal return. I believe Kundera refutes this burden by challenging that, without being able to affect any change in this ever repeating cycle, we have only the one life to live. Thus, we can shed the weight of the return, by ensuring we are constantly seeking the best in our own action. It's that endeavour alone which can set us free. This may fit perfectly with what you are investigating because it does not award any unique rights or responsibilities to humanity. It merely provides certain people, who can internalize this view, with the added ability to achieve happiness. If I am off base in my understanding of the novel, please feel free to correct. 

I think one cannot derive the veil of ignorance from Kant's Categorical Imperative. Both do not contradict, but they follow different aims. Rawl's veil of ignorance is a means to generate fair decisions in case of a conflict of interests. It can be used for all votings where the consequences of the result affect at least some of the voting people. Kant's Categoric Imperative on the other hand states a formal condition which any maxime for action must have. The condition is a kind of universalization. Hence both concepts live on different levels. But one can use the veil of ignorance when a group votes, whether a certain action adheres to the Categoric Imperative. 

Added due to Frank's comment: The real-valued probability function is not sufficent because the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics and of all types of quantum field theories are wave-equations. A wave is characterized at each point in spacetime by its amplitude A and its phase phi, see John's answer. That property corresponds to the characteristic of a complex number z when written in polar coordinates: 

According to utilitarism your last implication is right "If surveillance doesn't increase happiness of the public, then it would be immoral." But the problem is to determine which kinds of surveillance are to be considered and which additional effects - possibly increasing security - also result from surveillance. Not until answering these questions one can decide, whether surveillance should be terminated or continued. 

Heidegger would certainly agree and would argue that these people have not achieved "being" in the true sense of it. *this answer needs expansion, and I will add later. 

There are several interesting documentaries that deal with this topic of art appreciation vs art curation. "My Kid Could Paint That" directed by Amir Bar-Lev and "Who the *$&% Is Jackson Pollock?" directed by Harry Moses both deal with the incongruence of art value as an intrinsic quality of art versus a value determined by the curator and "high art community". This is not a new trend, as its much the same in classical art patron who supports and commissions art. I think the difference is a change in society. We are less divided in a socially enforced aristocracy. Instead we are increasingly using economics to define this division. Thus, we have professionalized this divid using curators. Additionally, the availability of social media and internet access has made it so that art can be disseminated by and to the mass public. As a somewhat opposing force, there are communities that employ credentialism in order to create a qualitative differentiation, and this relies on the institutionalization of curating. 

I believe that the phrase explains that beauty in aesthetics is an a priori knowledge that is simultaneously the highest positive value and personification of truth. Aesthetics is an experiential phenomena that is external to ourselves and, ostensibly, is an appreciation for the truth of beauty (which is perceived as a universal concept in the author's theory). It is not related to one's person satisfaction, but an a priori truth and value accessed through this appreciation. Therefore, it is intrinsically "unselfed". 

We know that Aristotle was a student of Plato. But Aristotle emancipated from his teacher. Aristotle in his Metaphysics, Book 1, Chapter 6 and 9, critizises Plato's theory of forms. And also most distinctly (Analytica posteriora, Book 1, Chap. 22): The Forms we can dispense with, for they are mere sound without sense. Aristotle was 37 when Plato died. At this time, both were active 20 years in Plato's academy. I would ask Aristotle: How did Plato respond to your objections against his theory of forms? 

Nietzsche hated any form of compassion, his ideal was the strong man. Buddhism became known in Europe during Nietzsche's time. Buddhist ethics emphasizes compassion. Therefore Nietzsche rejected Buddhist ethics alike rejecting Christian ethics. Nietzsche does not think that Europe misunderstands Buddhism. 

According to the well-known model from special relativity (Minkowski space) an event is a point in spacetime. Expressed in common language: An event is at least characterized by 4 components, namely 3-spatial components: Where does the event take place? - Crossing of 48th street with 5th Avenue, 35th floor. And one time component: When does it take place? Tomorrow, 4 p.m. Hence: 

There are few examples of persons active in both disciplines mathematics and philosophy. The two most eminent are Leibniz and Russell. Kant - in reply to Leibniz - published one essay on a certain topic from mechanics. He also has been thinking on the origin of the planetary system. But because physics is not the topic of the present question I will not go into the details. Instead I want to emphasize the differences between mathematics and philosophy and between the methods employed in each field. 

Usage of adages like "Bigger is always better" in this way may be considered a faulty generalization, and more specifically a "thought-terminating cliche": 

Jean Jacques Rousseau agrees with the OP criticism; "the notion of human rights is imaginary and reducible to absurdity (that humans by virtue of being born are magically entitled to certain things)... [and] that human rights are a human invention" Rousseau argues in the introduction to "A Discourse on Inequality" that human rights, if they do in fact exist, are not accessible to man, and therefore a declaration of them is flawed. An abridged version of his argument is as follows: 

Referring to the work of Thomas Hobbs (b. 1588 - d. 1679), John Locke (b. 1632 - d. 1704), and Francis Bacon (b. 1561 - d. 1662), the innate concepts of right and wrong boil down to "Might equals Right". This is the rule while living in the "State of Nature". To move out of the "State of Nature" (i.e. To form a society) people must collectively form a social contract that replaces the "Might equals Right" concept with what ever social order the community is founded on. However, even the truth of "Might equals Right" remains, except we forfeit some of our individual freedom and strength over to the "Sovereign" who is now the apex of "Might" in society. It can be argued that Charles Darwin (b. 1809 - d. 1882) proposed additional insight into the regular behavioral incentives exhibited in nature; survival in order to reproduce. However, his theories were not exclusive to "intelligent" creatures. In fact he argues that it is the environment that dictates much of the "rules" we come to abide by to survive and procreate. Lastly, you may want to consider the topic of Utilitarianism, starting with John Stuart Mills (b. 1806 - d. 1873). In Utilitarianism, we abandon the qualitative evaluations of good versus bad. You instead quantify them in terms of increased utility (which provides parameters on how to distinguish and calculate good). This is not a universally excepted definition, but in quantifying utility you demonstrate your reasoning, rather than arguing based on the subjective qualitative features.
