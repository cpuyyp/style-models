Why is DNS using the DomainDNSZone and is that acceptable considering _msdcs... is in the ForestDNSZone? If so, should I just delete the DC=1.168.192.in-addr.arpa and DC=supernova.local from the ForestDNSZone? Or should I try to get those to be the ones in use? What are those steps? I understand how to delete. That is simple but if i must move zones some info would be appreaciated there. Just to confirm. from my understanding. I can delete the two duplicates in the ForestDNSZone and leave the _msdcs.supernova.local as thats required there. This will resolve the erros I see. 

Do they actually have to be physically removed? Could them not appearing in the address book be acceptable? There is a setting to "Hide from Exchange address lists". It is under the "Exchanged Advanced" tab in the user properties. It can be toggled at the admins discretion. Takes a little while to sync with everyone's Outlooks. Seems like you are doing this for security reasons so I don't know if its acceptable. But if users cannot find the mailboxes they wont know they exist. Security by obscurity.... 

Use multiple namespaces to get the shorter path. So instead of having a share and then your folders for DFS inside. Make each individual folder its own namespace and publish those. Though I feel having all the replicated shares in one place makes it easier for the users to visually pick the folder they want out of the many. They only then need to remember one path. The users can check our wiki if they forget it. Our DFS namespace is \\DOMAIN.LOCAL\datastore and all the replicated shares are inside there. There may be a slight performance increase in going everything in one namespace but I don't feel it is significant. Hope that gives you a little insight. 

I wrote this for my company on installing SQL 2005 on Server 2008. They may have had an older version SP but same principal applies you just may not need the hotfix or get the compatibility warning. Microsoft SQL Server 2005: Warning: SQL Server 2005 will give you issues when installing on x64 Server 2008. This can be worked around. Please follow these steps in the right order and do not proceed to install SQL Server 2005 with errors or warnings you most likely will need to uninstall and start over. Understand that SQL server installation will post a known compatibility warning. This is fine and is not an issue. The first thing that is required is to enable IIS to run 32bit applications. Specifically ASP.NET. This is accomplished with 2 adjustments in IIS Server Manager. You must globally enable 32-bit applications. 

We currently run Symantec Antivirus Corporate 10.2. The software is really easy to manage on a network but the actual virus detection isn't bad but the malware detection is crap. We recently were infected with a email bot that got us put on some block lists. This has been resolved. I cannot have that happen again. I would like to find a program as easy to manage as symantec that I can install on all the user's workstations as well as the servers. We run a windows 2003 domain. We have a couple 2008 test servers in the environment. Most of the workstations are xp though I am using windows 7 and symantect is not compatible with this OS... So we need a solution that would cover all those operating systems. If it could be installed on macs too that would be a bonus though not necessary at all. This software must detect: Viruses AND Malware I am looking for something that combines the features in anti-malware programs like malwarebytes or spybot with an antivirus program like symantec or AVG. Alternatively if there is a piece of hardware that is a firewall, router, and packet inspection for virus/spam that would be the most ideal solution. I then could supplement with a piece of software that could pickup what the hardware misses. Thank you for your suggestions. UPDATE: I am in talks with AVG for their AVG Internet Security Business Edition. Have others used this program? How did they find the admin panel for it? Any suggestions for removing Symantec to install AVG? UPDATE2: I am waiting to get AVG approved for our servers. Any input that is against this decision? Any horror stories? 

We are trying to make a rule where if a message has XXXXX in the subject then move to the Junk Folder. I have granted my user full access rights to all mailboxes on the server. I have confirmed I can create the rule with users individually The issue is that the command works for some users and not for others. Similarily the command is creating multiple copies of the rule for some users and not for others. There does not seem to be any pattern to this at all. Here is my command 

I accomplished both using ASDM and "Public Servers" How this is not mentioned online anywhere is beyond me. By configuring this one setting it configures all necessary firewall rules! It is simple and straight forward. I was able to accomplish all my questions with this one section. Here is a screen shot. 

Go to where the computer object is located in AD and right click and select Properties. Under the security tab you can specify who has access and their rights on the machine. 

Right click on the attachment Click "Save link as" Done! Just tested this with a .docx EDIT: Screenshot alt text $URL$ If that is to hard to see click here 

I have an exchange server 2003 running in Windows 2003. I have an unnamed program that listened for incoming mail, signs it with DKIM and then should relay it back to the Exchange server. I am a little lost on how to configure the SMTP in exchange 2003 system manager to relay sent mail through the proxy and then listen for it to come back signed. Once that is complete it is to send the mail to the specified address. I know it involved relay and possibly connectors but the exact steps have eluded me. Lets assume the proxy works perfect I just want to know how to relay to a specified IP and port then listen on another port when it comes back and then send it out. Thanks, 

UPDATE: I have not properly Installed AVG Business Internet Security 9.0 on my Windows Server 2003 R2 with Exchange 2003. Seems like it needs to be added/Installed to the application Servers section in the admin console. Can anyone shed some light on how to do this? **FINAL UPDATE HERE IS AVG reply :) Dear customer, The file that you had referenced, avg_ipw_stf_all_90_839a2960.exe, is the installation file intended for workstations and file servers. The file you should be installing on an Exchange server would be the Email Server Edition (file name avg_msw_stf_all_90_839a2960.exe, which comes with plugins for scanning Exchange and Antispam plugins). Please download and deploy the following file to your Exchange server to have it correctly display in the Application Server group: $URL$ 

I am going to answer in the "What Else" Section I am not a security expert but have noticed a recent trends in viruses and malware is moving away from the PC market in general towards, Smartphones, Tablets, OSX.... 2010 was the first year that there was a noticeable drop in spam levels... This is very dangerous as more and more are users doing mobile banking and online transactions, etc... while the devices have absolutely no or very little security. To compound that the user feels immortal owning that OSX device "that can't get a virus" so they say.... But to be honest that could not be further from the truth. As for repositories of virus infected files just take a look at Symantec or AVG or any other antivirus site they all publish their signatures. Or even Google a particular malware will usually produce sites that track these sorts of things. Hope this helped you to expand your presentation a little to cover emerging targets. 

I have done this and it worked fine. This was the environment; Windows Server 2003, WSUS, SQL 2005 Express and we also ran Standard for a while. We eventually had a disaster and made that computer the DC and AD as well. It all ran fine. Until the disaster I had full confidence in the setup. After the disaster I felt is was best to offload the DB. The DB was for ACT a horrid sales force like program. 

Open IIS Server Manager Expand server in Connections Pane Select Application pools In Actions Pane select Set Application Pool Defaults... Under General find Enable 32-Bit Applications and change from False (default value) to True Next Ensure that all the installed Application Pools have 32-Bit Applications Enabled. If they do not you will receive a warning when installing SQL Server 2005. 

What are some solutions to this issue I am sure this has come up many times in the past. I can see his user account or workstation computer in it's own OU with its own GPO but I am unsure where to go from there. 

I feel that is an option when the user sets up the account. Here are my directions Account Settings > New Account > Internet E-Mail > Check Manually configure and click next. Type in your settings and click the "More Settings" button. Then click the "Advanced" tab. The last section in there is "Delivery". Check the "Leave a copy of the messages on the server and make sure the Remove options are NOT checked. This should do it! 

Most modern hard disks have a built in monitoring called S.M.A.R.T. (wiki) There are many tools for your OS that would be able to monitor that. For windows look into Active@ Hard Disk Monitor Freeware just as a starting point Your RAID controller may have built in S.M.A.R.T. monitoring as well so look there if this is for a server. 

If you cannot install as an upgrade and warning are asking you to unistal and instal fresh then that is what you should do. 

Seems like the users group policy is not being applied. Is there an event log on the error? Are you sure you have your group policy setup on the OU that this computer is part of? @ SMOAK Seems like he is logging into the domain as his user account would not work on the local machine. Unless he has a local and domain user with the same user name and password. EDIT/ADDITION Seems like they are pulling the Group Policy from the domain not the virtual domain. Go to AD in the OU that contains the computers right click the OU then go to properties then select the "Group Policy" tab. Add your group policy there. Group policies are applied from bottom to top and override each other. 

I have a security policy question: I want to know how other admins handle the WIFI password in the office. 

We have two servers. They are both HP DL 380 G6 servers with the same hardware and specs running Windows Server 2008. Currently the second server is a warm standby for the first with an automatic fail over cluster for SQL 2008 Enterprise. I would prefer to have both servers running and serving requests. Therefore if our staff need heavy reports generated from the database they can use the secondary server without slowing down the web requests from our users. The idea would be to have a dfs style replication for the databases files to assure symmetrical databases in real or near real time on both servers. Only one server would be serving the web requests. There are no plans for a load balancer currently. I am familiar with fail over clustering but this sort of simultaneous clustering has eluded me. can someone shed some light on this? Maybe I am looking at this all wrong. Thanks! Addition: Thanks for the responses. I find it hard to belive with 25,000 dollar software you cannot scale out to multiple servers. How do large companies deal with ever growing requirements? No one machine can handle a large site like Facebook if they used MSSQL (which I'm sure they don't but its just an example) ADDITION2: Still looking for a little more feedback if anyone would be so kind. Remember to look in the comments too.
