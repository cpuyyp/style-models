There are several reasons why the bulk of the people are only awake at night that haven't been touched on yet. Camouflage - They don't want anyone to know they're there - The city is too far away for others to harvest the crops, and the city specifically looks abandoned so people will leave them alone. Alternatively, the buildings may themselves be blending in with the environment Food - Nonstandard crops which have specific cycles that grow or bloom at nights. Nonstandard herd animals that happen to be nocutrnal. There could also be a particularly vicious/deadly type of insects in the area (think bees/wasps) that operate during the day, so harvesting and planting at night is a means to that end. Extenal Forces - You spoke of markets, merchants and tradesmen - perhaps they are nocturnal because another neighboring area is also nocturnal, so they trade with each other in the darkness. Perhaps the area is very expansive in addition to being very tropical, with both high direct heat and punishing humidity. Moving at night limits allows quicker travel that's easier on not only the people, but work animals (horses, mules, et cetera) as well. Darksight - Mining is an important part of religion & society, so having good darksight is incredibly important. People who need the sun to see could be considered weak. They may also worship the moon as an extention of it. Glowing - Perhaps this society has some basic or tribal understanding of radiation or magic, so they are constantly on the look for glowing rocks. This could be something they collect to craft (think of the old radium watches) or magic (think Ioun Stones) or worship, or something they're scared of and avoid. War - You've mentioned they're in a war-like state with a neighboring area. If they operate in a guerrilla manner, that would work best with a nocturnal defense force. Perhaps the neighboring country also has nocturnal forces, either out of tradition, one of the above reasons, or they fight that manner out of honor, similar to the Ol' West's fascination with "High Noon". 

Make it track something that people normally don't, such as only preying on the second child. It will appear random, as lots of people are second children but only the firstborn is celebrated. They will all be different ages, in different stages of life, be men & women. There will also be a built-in throwoff for any family whose actual firstborn was stillborn or otherwise lost very early. Certain families will be completely unaffected (they either don't have any secondborns, or they have already perished or left the area), while others will be absolutely devastated (for example, if both father and mother were secondborn as well as their secondborn child... even more confusing with blended families). 

Funnily enough, this was already done. Prior to the transition of Fiat Currencies, a common form of currency in the dark/middle ages was Grain Receipts. Farmers would deposit their grain in a silo, get a series of receipts and then exchange them for goods & services, and the recipients of those receipts could exchange them again for grain. Being grain, it does go bad over time, so the receipts were dated and could "go bad" and become worthless. However, this limited the influence of nobility, who couldn't really use grain receipts to fill coffers or have taxes, so the creation of the feudal states also came alongside the introduction of currency based on precious metals... something the nobles had in abundance. The impact of the two systems were very different. While a fiat currency would be accepted everywhere in a certain realm, Grain Dollars were highly localized based on the location of the grain storage silos, and while they could potentially be traded further away, there was a risk for anyone receiving that currency that the amount of grain would be worthless if they waited to long to retrieve. This created a very diverse economies that were segregated from each other, still operating on a bartering principle for people passing through, or going between townships. Because there was no single bank in the middle, each township would rise or fall depending on their own behest, not the influence of outsiders, nor were there much by way of faceless syndicates controlling things because everything is hyperlocalized. Some differences to our economy: Savings are only good for hard assets - Stocks could still function, but bonds would not. Real estate, education and heirlooms would be more powerful as investment vehicles. Pensions would be replaced by things like REITs, CMOs, and profitsharing/dividend investments. Credit would be de-emphasized or be in a different execution than what we have now. If you would like to do some research on systems such as this, you can look at the Ithaca Hour, an existing hyperlocal currency, as well as research on the ancient Jewish economy, which was based on 7-year cycles where all debts were cancelled, and all lands were returned to their original owners. 

Without some sort of illusion field generator, there's no way a cybernetic prostheses would make the entire body in non-reflectable... Unless the prostheses was the entire body (insert Iron Man quote here). In that case, you could have a device that physically reacts to the location around it, changing colors automatically, to blend in with the background like an octopus, changing colors and patterns to that of surrounding objects. This would be very off-putting, so you tie in a holographic decide that projects the "skin tone and clothing" to other people in the area. However, to save power consumption, the illusion is compressed, like the difference between live music and an mp3, but in a visual sense, almost like a polarized lens. It just so happens that mirrors are also slightly polarized due to their construction, so they don't reflect the projected image, just the camouflaged one... Basically the effect of looking at a tinted car window through polarized sun glasses makes it opaque, executed in reverse. The reflection of vampire prostheses in the mirror wouldn't technically be invisible whilst moving, as the camouflage would refresh and show something obscured moving, but as soon as he or she stands still, the reflection vanishes. This would have an interesting effect that it would only work with mirrors that are mounted or otherwise upright... Reflective surfaces on the floor, such as pools of water outside, would show the prostheses in stark contrast to the sky. The wielder could also turn off the illusion to become mostly invisible if need be. Again, this explanation only works for full body prosthetics... If you have it for any less than 100% portion of the body, the camouflage wouldn't apply to the remaining amount. For example, if the prostheses only covered one from the neck down, mirrors would show a floating head. 

This has happened all over the United States, and thus there are ample examples and stories of both... be it the logging, fur trading, milling, or mining industry, more than a couple cities have been forced to adapt or go belly-up. Also, a variation of this is the setting of the Pixar movie "Cars", which is amusing. There are towns drowned by damming, still others that gave up the ghost when the river moved. Here's a similar situation, where a series of towns surrounding a canal system were rendered obsolete by railroads, and of course there are many stories of "company towns" in the coal or auto manufacturing industries. You would choose whichever makes a more compelling story. Do you want the peoples to be fighting for their survival, either by becoming self-sufficient, or inventing a new industry to replace the old (we lost the river but have this marble in the hills that we hadn't bothered with)? Is it more interesting to have these people understand that this chapter of their life is over and have them explore what's next? They could move to the city, join the new route to follow the job, get hired on with the Baron, shift to trapping or logging, or go deeper into the fields to make it on their own away from the city. 

If I'm understanding the question, you're looking for a point where the normal perceptive time-dialation effect is not only experienced by people at the center of it but also all people in the immediate area. For lack of better explanation, I'm guessing this is some sort of 'hive mind' awakening. The initial feeling would be a combination of disbelief, concern, panic, people looking for the cause of it. There would be a trickle-up effect similar to the beginnings of Torchwood: Miracle Day or Children of Men. Once this is awakened in the general populace and become normalized, you'll see certain things rising. There will be people who are thrillseekers, trying to trigger the dilation effect as often as possible. Others will seek out situations to avoid it. Due to various brain chemistries, there may be people who can trigger the dilation through focus and/or meditation, or people that better/worse at experiencing or otherwise reacting to the dilation. Overall, people will have slightly better reaction times - while they aren't physically able to move faster, the time dilation would allow them to plan and move their body more finely with the time that they do have. As for impact, there really won't be a major overhaul without other factors. There may be a sharp decline of certain types of accidents, but not on others - for example, it'd be easier to grab people stepping in front of buses, but have no (or even a negative) impact to the elderly falling down in their homes. If you were adding some sort of supernatural element to the world, where there are fairies/angels/demons/spirits that exist that are normally too fast to see, that could definitely impact religions, but that won't move the needle on most, save using it to increase productivity in meditation & prayer. You could definitely see research from scientists to try to exploit the time dilation, as you could effectively replicate "flow state" if used properly, which could have application everywhere from the schoolhouse to corporate to factories to the battlefield. Magicians would have a harder time practicing their craft, while surgeons would probably find it easier. Police and soldiers would trigger the dilation frequently, giving them more time to assess the situations that would have turned deadly without that added focus. There may be a portion of the population that has adverse reactions to the dilation - the added perception of time may exhaust people, mentally or physically, over multiple exposures. PTSD and similar syndromes would be more severe, as the event that triggers the disorder, the initial traumatic stress, would feel like it lasted even longer. I'm sure there are some other impacts to society, but the overall change would not be as large as one may think. 

It really depends more on the type of generational starship. If we're talking about a Traditional Generation ship, a massive one-way vessel designed to keep hundreds or thousands of people alive for hundreds of years then colonize, there are very few reasons to engage in piracy. Since a Generation ship is so massive, you'd have to have an equally massive empty ship to take on the spoils... if you have anything smaller, the generation ship would just grow back the loss over time. It would be different if it is a Suspended Generation Ship (Such as in Hugh Howey's Half Way Home), because the colonist's ship is going to be growing the colonists in a vat, matrix-style, only when they get close to the destination. Pirates can board and take what they like due to a skeleton crew (if there is a crew) onboard, with almost no pushback. Going back to a traditional Gen Ship, the massive time difference would psychologically impact both crews, not just the colonists. Over twenty generations (~500 years), the "incoming pirates" may 

I could see a creature with an Ant-Man or Wasp - style suit or capability to decrease the size, becoming more dense when it transforms. This could be a biological creature or a collection of microbots that can shift forms... or some combination of both. 

There are multiple tropes and answers to this, but I'll draw from my favorite medias that concern this issue - The books Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, Cory Doctorow's Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom and Rapture of the Nerds, and the short TV shows Caprica and Sword Art Online. What would life be like? It would just be life. In a post-scarcity society, there is no direct need to work - only an innate desire to work, for either internal or external reasons. Terrible people would still be terrible, freeloaders will still freeload. While all people with mental deficiencies or disorders could be catered and supported individually, you may also see a rise of narcissism, sociopathy and psychopathy. There's still going to be schooling, although public, private, and home schooling would blur together, with a vast amount of variations on learning taking effect. Society would be a blend of socialism with capitalist frosting, with the only people lacking the basics would be of their own volition. As you mentioned, there would still be various things to do, from tech or social support, science & engineering, software & hardware, research and development, government & law enforcement. "Quests" would appear as a style of on-demand freelance work, an evolution of the 'gig economy' that's rising in 1st world countries currently. The quest for meaning will have different effects on people, but with the benefit of any pursuit could be simulated. As we see in the virtual worlds in Caprica, through holobands, Raves that don't end, wars with no resolution, hundreds of miles of hunting or fishing, entire virtual cities to build, manage, and destroy if desired, wardrobes to match, virtual clothes to design, spiritual pilgrimages to complete, with room for everyone. Depending on the style of the virtual world, as seen in Sword Art Online and Ready Player One, there may be monsters to slay, puzzles to solve and treasure to find. What sorts of social groups would form and what hobbies would people have? All of them. Once the world gets sync'd into that main virtual world, you'll have existing hobbies evolve and entirely new ones arise. You'll have suicidal skydiving groups who want that rush of jumping higher and higher to slam into the ground, knowing they'll respawn (or bounce). Fangirls and fanboys will tirelessly create and live in the objects of their desire - Enterprises, TARDISs, Death Star's, or, like in Down & Out in the Magic Kingdom, Disney World. You'll see people theorycrafting and min-maxing to empower their virtual characters in variations on video & tabletop games, and applying those in different manners - Maybe a group that gets together to rob virtual banks, over and over, so that bank security can be upgraded. You'll still have painters, crafty people, remixers, adrenaline junkies and the like - but they'll evolve with the medium. Where would their interests lie? There are no interests that are unknown to man already, just those that have been suppressed for one reason or another. You'll have people that embrace the shift wholeheartedly, those who pine for ye olden days, and others that pair them together. The spiritual may think of the change as an abomination whilst others will see it as a form of afterlife or even eternal life (this is one of the themes in Caprica). You'll begin to see outliers with interests formally taboo converge together - people experimenting with virtual cannibalism, trying to set themselves up as prophets from unknown gods, people creating virtual worlds devoid of certain races, colors or creeds. On the other hand, those with more familiar interests will continue to evolve on multiple levels, whether that be environmentalism, fatalism, idealism, romanticism, antidisestablishmentarianism, et cetera. This is explored in Revenge of the Nerds. Where would they go from there? Society would of course continue to evolve. If you're writing a story, you probably want a faction to break away from the status quo, rebelling from the lifespurned by of machines similar to the resistance in the Matrix, or the members of the Dread Reservation from the movie Surrogates (there's also a comic, but I don't have first hand knowledge of it). This could be a source of conflict, like the stories mentioned above, or a peaceful division, such as the existence of the Amish in our own world. Like you mentioned, the society in question hasn't dived towards the stars, so after a whole lot of playing of Kerbal Space Program and Elite Dangerous they may actually pull that trigger as well.
