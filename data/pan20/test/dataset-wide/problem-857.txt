At the time the Big Bang happened the matter had enormous density. According the GR (I may be wrong here) such density dilates time. If so, could it be that the time periods just after Big Bang which are usually considered happening in small part of a second (such as the Planck epoch), in reaity took billons of year (or may be, infinity) but due to time dilation appear to us as spanning only microscopic parts of a second? Could it be that the age of the universe is dramatically underestimated? 

Alpha Centauri Bb is an exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri B. It is asserted that given the close distance to the star the planet should be tidally locked. The orbiting period of the planet is about 3.2 days. If the planet has no atmosphere (which is very possible due to proximity to the star), its dark side should experience low temperatures like permanently-shadowed areas of Mercury do. At the same time the planet is about 11 AU from the other star, Alpha Centauri A. This possibly means that the planet should experience quasi-day/night cycle each 3.2 days. My questions are: 

I have been researching this on google, and I think there is a process. What is this process called? I have forgotten. 

The best way to tell the difference between planets and stars is: (From here) Early astronomers were able to tell the difference between planets and stars because planets in our Solar System appear to move in complicated paths across the sky, but stars don't. That is, if you observe the sky night after night, the stars will all appear in fixed positions with respect to each other. They will rise and set a few minutes earlier each night (an effect that is due to the Earth's motion around the Sun), but otherwise nothing will change. This is why the background stars are sometimes referred to as the "celestial sphere" -- from our point of view, it looks like the stars are "painted" onto a gigantic sphere that surrounds Earth and therefore are unable to move with respect to each other. Planets, on the other hand, are observed to move in very complicated paths with respect to the background stars, sometimes even appearing to go "against the grain" and reverse their directions. Therefore, they are easily distinguishable from stars if you look at the sky night after night. Although ancient astronomers did not have a correct explanation for this phenomenon, we now know that the complicated motion is just a projection effect -- it is due to the fact that Earth and the other planets are physically moving in orbits around the Sun, so the planets' relative positions as seen from Earth (with respect to the fixed background stars) change as time goes on. There are other observational differences between planets and stars too, by the way -- such as the fact that planets almost never twinkle. Like the text said, if an object doesn't twinkle, it's most likely to be a planet. If you observe it every night, and it appears to change its position more than stars do. Although stars also change their positions, they don't change their positions in the sky as much as planets throughout the year. Stars maintain positions relative to one another, constellations are a great to tell the difference between planets in stars. What I mean by maintaining their positions is that each night they are usually in the same pattern and usually the same distance apart in the night sky. 

Is there a theoretical limit on what we can see with a telescope of fixed size based on Earth's orbit or the Moon, that is in Earth's region of Solar system outside the Earth's atmosphere? Why not instead of sending probes to Pluto and Ceres, just invest efforts into building better telescopes, so to photograph the surfaces of these bodies in greater detail? I suspect that all necessary information in fact reacheds Earth's region, it is just matter of sensibility and exposure to fix it, am I right? 

To what temperatures the dark surface of such planet could be heated? Is there possibility of liquid water? Will the radiation of the second star be enough to provide normal day-like illumination and heating? Will the calendar on such a planet differ sufficiently from a calendar of a planet that experiences day/night cycles from the nearest star? Will such planet experience seasons and how they would be arranged? 

I was looking at a wikipedia article ($URL$ and I came across an interesting aspect that said pulsars turn off from rotation. What I don't understand is why emission of EM waves would slow a pulsar down? 

If I understand correctly, red dwarfs consume all of their hydrogen and will eventually shrink into helium white dwarfs, whereas the higher mass stars will consume a fair amount of their hydrogen fuel, not necessarily all of it. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

Keep in mind that there are probably more ways for binary stars to form. Also, a collision isn't very likely to form these systems. 

Usually, when a star dies, it will usually form a planetary nebula or supernova and most of this matter will reach the interstellar medium. When it collapses due to some disturbance, a protoplanetary disk forms, it will cool off eventually. Once it is low enough temperature to form compounds, usually molecular hydrogen (H2) will form first. Here is something that may help you: No, H2O cannot exist in stars, but H and O separately can. Hydrogen is the basic building material of the universe, created in the Big Bang. Oxygen is created by nuclear reactions in stars. If you put H and O together in the cold of space, you get H2O. There are enormous amounts of water in space. In fact, nearly all of the oxygen in space is in the form of water or carbon monoxide. Similarly, most the carbon and nitrogen in space are also in their most hydrogenated forms: methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). (Source) Since water is H2O, it is likely to form because nebulae contain so much hydrogen and some oxygen. The Earth was most likely hit by comets and asteroids that contained water, and when our planet cooled off, we got our oceans. 

I have not studied this galaxy cluster specifically. However, I can speak about systems like galaxy clusters that have a large number of bodies that are in close enough proximity to have a non-negligible gravitational effect on each other. For any such n-body system, where n is large (a solar system, a galaxy, a galaxy cluster,...), it can be assumed that, 1. there is a net angular momentum of the system, and 2. it is reasonable to assume that this angular momentum is non-negligible. I state 1 and 2 based on the following (very general model of solar system and galaxy cluster formation). Such n-body systems form by the collapse of a very large amount of gas, dust, and other minerals. When fully extended, these clouds are cold, the the velocities of any given molecule or atom in them is comparatively slow. However, it is very improbable that the total angular momentum of the cloud of gas is zero, and more importantly, that it is close to zero. From this point, it is easy to reason that, so long as no angular impulse is applied to the system and no mass is added or removed from the system, the gas cloud can collapse or disperse in whatever way is consistent with the conservation of angular momentum, and the angular momentum of the system will not change. Thus, a galaxy cluster like Abel 1689 should have a non-negligible angular momentum. But I have skipped over the most important logical step in the above argument. I simply assumed again that the angular momentum of the gas cloud would not be even close to zero, effectively shifting the level of the explanation up one level. Unfortunately, the best answer to "why do the gas clouds have non-negligible angular momentum?" requires explaining where the gas clouds came from. The extent of my understanding here is that the gas clouds that formed galaxy clusters only existed during the very early universe. Once they collapsed into galaxies, there is no process that could have caused a galaxy cluster (or even a galaxy) to disperse so completely that it forms a new very low density gas cloud that can re-collapse. Thus, the gas that made the galaxy cluster must have had an angular momentum if the galaxy cluster system is to have angular momentum. I do not know if the sum total of the angular momentum in the universe is said to be zero or some finite value. However, I do know that even if it is zero, localized regions of matter in a system that has zero angular momentum do not also need to have zero angular momentum. Thus, the Abell 1689 system could be one such local region with non-zero angular momentum. Continuation: According to The Cosmic Perspective: Seventh Edition, when considering galaxies that have not yet collided with another galaxy, the initial angular momentum of the protogalactic cloud is a large contributor in determining if a galaxy will be spiral or elliptical galaxies. Regarding elliptical galaxy clusters, TCP has this to say: "Observations of galaxies in clusters support the idea that at least some elliptical galaxies result from collisions and subsequent mergers. Elliptical galaxies dominate the galaxy populations at the cores of dense clusters of galaxies, where collisions should be most frequent. This fact may mean that any spirals once present became ellipticals through collisions." Thus, TCP suggests in this paragraph that at least certain clusters contain dense cores of elliptical galaxies that resulted from collisions and mergers of galaxies that had markedly different angular momenta, resulting in a new galaxy that has much less angular momentum. But this doesn't really answer your question either. I have looked also for scholarly articles to find some consensus on what the typical angular momentum characteristics are, and found very little. Most discussions of galaxy cluster formation discuss filament formation and collapse. The one article of note I found was from Tom Crawford at the University Of Chicago: askanastronomer.org "The most obvious and uncontroversial class of structures beyond the galaxy is the galaxy group or cluster. These structures consist of tens to thousands of individual galaxies that are bound by gravity to one other and orbit a common center. That center is not defined by some huge central object, as the Sun defines the center of our solar system, but instead by the center of all the mass in the cluster, including dark matter. In fact, the dark matter dominates the mass budget of galaxy clusters, outweighing the normal matter by about a five-to-one ratio." This description suggests more than just "random" motions of gravitationally bounded objects (galaxies), but does not definitively say anything about the net angular momenta of these systems. 

Black holes decrease as they evaporate and their radius decreases as well. So what is with a cosmological horizon? If cosmological horizon is just a black hole centered at the opposite side of the universe, we should see the radius of the external space groving as the radius of the BH decreases. But if the radiation decreases the horizon entropy we should see the area of the horizon decreasing. What is the correct conclusion? 

Why Earth's perihelion occurs 3rd January rather than 1st January? Is there any effort to correct this discrepancy? 

It was suggested that we could cool down Venus by putting a powder cloud in the Lagrange point between it and the Sun. This will cool Venus in a few months to the point where its atmosphere will start liquify, creating a global CO2 ocean. The surface of an ocean is much easier to colonize than creating flying cities. 

I know that a a planet or moon's rotation will slow down or speed up until it is tidally locked with a body, is Pluto's rotation being affected by the sun or is it being forced by Charon just to to be tidally locked with Charon? 

After doing research it said that nebulas are made of gas and dust. Are they actually gases and solids, or are they plasma? 

The moon will never spiral away. In case you did not know, the moon is moving away from Earth a tiny bit each year due to tidal effects and when Earth always has one side facing the moon, the moon will stop moving away. When they are tidally locked (always have one side facing each other) the will rotate at nearly the same speed. 

When planets are forming, does the densest material sink the core and the less dense material "float" on top? What I'm asking is that are the more dense materials more likely to appear in the core rather than the surface. I'm also wondering, can a planet have an iron surface and still have rock beneath the surface in its crust and core? 

If Great Attractor were the center of a black hole to which we belong, we would approach it at speed greater than speed of light and there would be no way to move away from it, even temporarily. Also we would observe it in any direction. 

If all trojans from the Greek camp and all the trojans of the Trojan camp were combined into two bodies respectively, what sizes and masses these bodies would have? Would they qualify as dwarf planets? Would they be greater than Ceres? 

I do not know how it is in your country, but here in Russia, astronomical articles and news very often report astronomical distances in kilometers, million kilometers, billion kilometers, trillion kilometers etc. It is just we do not use units like gigameters, petameters and the like, but kilometer is the standard unit in astronomy. 

P.S. I know real universe is not de Sitter but it is usually asserted that it approaches de Sitter state asymptotically. 

The specifics of the Pluto Charon system are complicated, so I will answer more generally for now. A single body orbiting the sun can be tidally locked with the sun if its rotational period (its day) is equal to its orbital period (its year). The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth because the period of one orbit of the moon around the Earth takes the same amount of time as one rotation of the moon about its axis. (Note that the Earth is not tidally locked with the Moon. One Earth day does not correspond to one lunar orbit.) A binary (dwarf) planet system (like Pluto and Charon) is considered to be tidally locked if their respective orbital periods about the common barycenter of mass are equal to their respective rotational periods, and all of these periods, for both objects, are equal to each other. You specifically asked about the tidal effects of the Sun on Pluto. Unfortunately, the complete answer depends on the orbital parameters of Charon and Pluto's orbits around the barycenter of mass. I will assume the orbits of Pluto and Charon are such that their orbital plane about the barycenter is not perpendicular to a radial vector drawn from the Sun to the barycenter of mass for the following explanation. (i.e. one body is slightly closer to the Sun at a given instant in the same way the Moon gets closer and farther from the Sun as it orbits the Earth). With this assumption, tidal effects from the Sun should slow the rotation of the Pluto Charon system about the barycenter (the orbital period of each body about the barycenter of mass should decrease over time). This slowing would occur because the radially inward (toward the Sun) side of the closer body would have a greater gravitational pull on it that the farther side of that body. Thus, the Sun's gravitational pull would attempt to slow the rotational period of that body (equivalently: increase the length of that body's "day"). This process I am describing is the same as the process that caused the Moon to become tidally locked to the Earth. The Pluto Charon system introduces complications to this explanation because of the highly inclined and atypical orbital parameters of the Pluto-Charon-[Other Plutonian Bodies] system, the varying masses of the system bodies, and the system's extreme distance from the Sun. The large orbital distance of the system from the Sun means that any tidal effects on Pluto and Charon are mild at their strongest. Thus, measurable changes due to tidal effects are next to impossible to measure over human time scales. 

I've read that Uranus has a lower surface gravity due to its lower density than Earth. However, does this mean Uranus has a weaker pull on its moons than Earth does for the same reason? 

This may sound a little bit confusing, but I will try to explain. (I have done research on this topic already) I have looked at the temperatures of planets and I was wondering, is there a point where a planet is at perigee and it's temperature cannot reach any higher? Let's just say the planet is tidally locked, and is currently at perigee. Would the planet be at a point where it's temperature can no longer be increased at the current distance from its star? 

That's a really good question. I'll explain as best as I can, there are about a number of ways this can happen. 

Yes, that is what it means. Pretty much each star in the Milky Way that does not orbit another star or object revolves around the SMBH. All planetary systems (solar systems) in our galaxy revolve around that point. It'a likely that most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, so usually each system orbits the SMBH(s) at the center. There actually may be more than one at the center, and in that case, the the stars and other objects will revolve around that system of supermassive black holes. But however, the SMBH isn't enough to keep the galaxy together. It also needs some of the gravity from the stars, nebulae, planets etc. that make it up.
