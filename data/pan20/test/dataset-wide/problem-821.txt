The HST orbits the Earth roughly in a plane. Also, the moon orbits the Earth roughly in a plane and the Earth orbits the sun in roughly a plane, and all three of these planes are within 30Â° or so of each other. So there's actually a rather large slice of sky (or two slices in opposite directions, if you prefer) where there are no regular interruptions to viewing. Furthermore, without knowing the exact design of the telescope, I'd nevertheless assume that it could through means of a shutter or other methods self-interrupt during times that a known interruption would obscure the intended shot. There's no particular reason for the telescope to take a single continuous exposure, after all. As far as your concerns about targets becoming "out of alignment," keep in mind that the HST is designed to be very sensitive for imaging very distant objects (with low apparent brightness). This means one of two things, depending on which end of the distance spectrum you're considering: 

"Cosmos" is the English cognate of the ancient Greek word which refers to the entirety of existence. It is equivalent to the Latin-derived word "universe;" the only difference between the two is the language of origin. 

The aspect of the universe described as "flat" is the spacetime curvature. In General Relativity gravity isn't treated as a force but as a curvature of the spacetime manifold. At large scales the universe is expanding: negative curvature like the top of a hill, where things roll downhill away from each other. But mass causes a positive curvature like a bowl, where things roll together, toward the bottom of the bowl. On average the two regimes of curvature appear to be balanced - i.e. the universe is, on average, flat. 

Gravitational pull is determined by only two things: mass and distance. The greater the mass, the greater the pull. The shorter the distance, the greater the pull. At the same distance (measured to the center), objects with the same mass will exert the same gravitational pull, no matter what they are. A black hole, a neutron star, a normal star, a giant marshmallow - they all pull the same at the same distance if their masses are the same. The only difference is this: normal stars are quite fluffy and bloated, you can't get too close to their center because pretty soon you'll run into their surface, and that's where the formula for the pull changes. So the maximum pull from a normal star is not too big, simply because you can't get "close enough" to the center. Neutron stars are much more dense. You can get a lot closer to their center before you hit the surface. So at the same mass, a neutron star lets you get closer so as to generate a greater pull. Black holes are the most dense of all. In theory you could get arbitrarily close to the center, because the BH is all in the center (sort of, not really, probably). So at the same mass, a BH could theoretically generate the greatest pull. 

Buy a book called Turn Left At Orion. It will get you started with how to find and observe DSOs, complete with instructions on which time of the year is best for each object, how much magnification (this is a bit subjective), etc. It's a very good book, I highly recommend it. $URL$ I would go with either a sturdy hardcover edition, or the spiral bound one - something that works well out in the field, not some snowflake paperback. A planisphere is a good thing to have. You only use it 5 or 10 minutes each night, but it will quickly get you oriented in the sky when you do. $URL$ When reading the book or the planisphere, use a red light at the minimum intensity that allows you to read. This will preserve your night vision. There are many red flashlights out there made for astronomers, that allow you to dial down the intensity. This is only needed for DSOs. Night vision does not matter for the planets or the Moon. 

Based on a Simbad search, it looks like the most distant white dwarf is WD J0106-0014, which was measured in Debes et al. 2011 to be at 6442 pc. Here's the Simbad page: $URL$ 

It is indeed possible to measure the AU using transits of Mercury, and Edmund Halley tried to do just that in 1677. However, there are two advantages to a transit of Venus. The first is that during the transit, Venus is only 0.28 AU from Earth, whereas Mercury is about 0.7 AU away. This makes the parallactic effect twice as big. The second difficulty is that you need to measure the time between second contact and third contact (i.e., the first and last time that the planet is entirely in front of the Sun). Mercury is so small that it is hard to determine when second and third contact are. (In fact the limiting effect for the measurement of the AU during the transit of Venus was the so-called "black drop effect", which made it impossible to measure the times of second and third contact to a precision less than about ten seconds.) A former professor of mine from when I was in graduate school has a really excellent writeup of the history of these measurements: $URL$ 

Stars less than about 0.3 solar masses are fully convective, so hydrogen throughout the entire star can be transported to the core and consumed. At higher masses, the core is radiative, so only hydrogen that starts in the core is consumed. 

I think the best answer is that there is no particular reason. In any planetary system, most orbits tend to stay close to a common plane - close, but not exactly there. Even the big planets are slightly out-of-plane with each other, but the differences are tiny. As you move away from the bulk of the planetary system's mass, smaller bodies tend to be more random. They are more easily deviated from encounters and near misses. Their origins might be different from the rest. If they get close to the outskirts of the system, that's a more unruly place, and orbit-changing events are more likely - especially for small bodies. Finally, the whole distribution of orbital planes has a bit of a stochastic (random) component anyway, and there will always be outliers that are quite different from the bulk. In theory, even some larger planets could be significantly "out of plane" (much more than they are right now), but that's unlikely and it tends to be smoothed out over large periods of time. So, Pluto is different because it's smaller and it's not really a planet, but don't attach too much significance to it. Try to install Universe Sandbox and play with some of the included scenarios. Big systems bound by gravity can be pretty complex, and completely orderly configurations are rare. 

Optics can take a huge amount of damage (chipping, scratching) before it really starts to affect performance. You'll be surprised at the amount of abuse a telescope can take like that. As long as it's not properly cracked in two, don't lose any sleep over it. 

The short answer to your question is no, there is not dark matter between galaxies, at least at any appreciable level. There is ordinary matter between galaxies, called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM is an extremely dilute, hot gas that pervades the space between galaxies. The typical density of the IGM is about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter and its temperature is somewhere around 10^6 K. These high temperatures keep the IGM in pressure equilibrium with any galaxies and prevent it from collapsing onto galaxies. Dark matter, however, is cold, and lacks the pressure support of the gas in the IGM, so it condenses onto galaxies. [1] One interesting difference between dark matter and ordinary matter is that dark matter lacks any sort of cooling mechanism. As a result, when ordinary matter collapses onto a galaxy, it can cool and condense into a relatively compact space and later form stars and planets. The dark matter, however, remains extended because it has no way to shed its gravitational potential energy. Galaxies therefore exhibit a substantial dark matter halo, where the ratio of dark matter to ordinary matter increases substantially a few galactic radii away from the center. Within the galaxy itself, ordinary matter is dominant by at least an order of magnitude, but the density of ordinary matter falls off exponentially while the dark matter falls off only with the cube of distance, leaving dark matter dominant a few galactic radii away from the galaxy. One interesting question is whether or not dark matter halos exist in intergalactic space without a corresponding host galaxy at the center. As far as we can tell, the answer to that seems to be no, or at least, such structures must be quite small and exceedingly rare. There are dwarf galaxies (only 10^6 solar masses or so) which have enormous dark matter halos (much out of proportion to their size, relative to the Milky Way), but nearly every halo seems to have at least some ordinary matter present, no matter how feeble. Cosmic voids are an even more extreme example. Voids are dominated by dark energy and therefore expand more rapidly than the rest of the universe. Voids tend to push any matter (dark or otherwise) into walls that separate them from surrounding voids. In a real sense, the universe is made of voids, and everything we know lies on the walls and filaments that separate them. This paper examined dark matter halos in cosmic voids and essentially found that there weren't any. In other words, they found that dark matter halos in cosmic voids have host galaxies just as often as dark matter halos outside of cosmic voids (which is to say, almost always). [1]: To be absolutely pedantic, I wouldn't doubt that there are a few dark matter particles whizzing about in intergalactic space. But I would be surprised if its density exceeded the (already puny) density of ordinary matter in the IGM. 

Let's say I'm floating in space with two toy tops. I spin them in opposite directions at the same speed. Each of them has angular momentum but the total angular momentum of the system is zero. On a larger scale the same thing could happen universe-wide. As stars and galaxies formed they would end up spinning every which way, but the total angular momentum would be unchanged. 

The term "superficial" means "on the surface," so "superficial gravity" is the same as surface gravity. As @pela pointed out in the comments, the author of the article is Portuguese and in that language the word for surface is 'superficie.' 

The only places around one black hole where gravity would be strong enough to pull an object out from inside the horizon of another black hole are all inside the horizon of the first hole. Remember that at minimum an object just inside the horizon of a black hole is traveling toward the center at the speed of light (as its speed would be measured from outside the hole, if we could see it) and getting faster. For a second black hole to catch up to the object to pull it out, it would itself have to be moving faster than the object - faster than light - which is obviously impossible but anyway would simply merge the two black holes, without rescuing anything. 

This is actually a very subtle question, much more so than the answers to the similar questions provided in the comments give it credit for. When I was in graduate school at Ohio State I routinely asked this question to visiting dynamicists and invariably got different answers. The very basic answer is that if you have two sufficiently strong resonances sufficiently close together, then the resonance will be unstable. Otherwise, the resonance will be stable. But what determines "sufficiently strong" and "sufficiently close" is where things get very complicated quickly. A basic criterion is the Chirikov criterion. (The Scholarpedia article is somewhat more detailed.) However, the Chirikov criterion is not universally valid. If you have overlapping resonances, then an object gets bounced back and forth between these two resonances chaotically. These different resonances perturb the orbit in different ways, and eventually they will perturb the orbit into an unstable orbit, thus leading to depletion of the resonance. If a resonance is "distant" from other resonances, then the resonance tends to keep objects locked in place, leading to an excess of objects in the resonance. Most of the resonances in the asteroid belt are fairly close together, which leads to them being unstable. The Kirkwood Gaps are the most prominent manifestation of these instabilities. For example, the Alinda family of asteroids are in a 1:3 resonance with Jupiter, and are very close to a 4:1 resonance with the Earth. This leads to instability, and hence very few asteroids in this family. However, in the outer Solar System, the resonances are generally far apart, and so are mostly stable. The plutinos are one example of such a stable resonance, being in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune. 

First off, the human eye is a wonderful device, but it's no match for modern cameras. We can't see colors at such low levels of light. We're all colorblind in those conditions. Only cameras continue to see color when illumination is low. As a result, when looking at objects such as nebulae or galaxies, including our own, all you see is a black-and-white image. Even with telescopes, the human eye still doesn't see colors in these objects. There is exactly one single exception - the Orion nebula, which is by far the brightest of all. Some observers, after a bit of practice, can begin to distinguish a few shades of color there. Planets, and some stars, are different. These objects are much more bright. The human eye has no trouble seeing color where color exists here. E.g. Jupiter is a slight shade of yellow, Betelgeuse is quite clearly red, etc. 

Yes, there are triple star systems, bound by gravity, that seem stable. See a list here: $URL$ There are also systems with 4 stars or more, although these are fewer, of course. One could argue that star clusters and galaxies are the ultimate N-body problem, for very large values of N. 

Of course, with a bigger barrel the eyepiece is larger, there's more glass in it, it's heavier and it can be more expensive. This is why manufacturers try to use the smaller barrels when it makes sense, and switch to bigger barrels only when physics and math force them to take this step. If you need a certain focal length combined with a certain field of view, and that requires a bigger barrel, then by all means use that size. It's kind of a mix-and-match situation. 

Andy Gould proposed a classical derivation of Hawking radiation in a somewhat obscure paper from 1987. The essential argument is that a black hole must have a finite, non-zero entropy (otherwise you could violate the second law of thermodynamics with a black hole). Moreover, the entropy of the black hole must depend only on its area (otherwise you could change the area of a black hole via the Penrose process and lower its entropy and make a perpetual motion machine). If a black hole has an entropy and a mass, then it has a temperature. If it has a temperature, then it must radiate thermally (otherwise you could again violate the second law of thermodynamics). Of course, if you look at the Hawking radiation temperature, there's a Planck's constant in there, so it has to know something about quantum mechanics, right? But it turns out that it's actually thermodynamics in general that knows about quantum mechanics, not general relativity --- Planck's constant is only needed to keep entropies finite (and therefore temperatures non-zero). This is true of black holes and blackbodies alike. 

There just aren't any other mechanisms to keep the population excited in a Stromgren sphere. In principle collisions can also lead to excitations, but if you do an order of magnitude calculation you'll find that the time between collisions is much longer than the time to receive an ionizing photon. In a laboratory setting you might be able to coerce some particles into remaining in an excited state using the Quantum Zeno effect, but that won't happen in interstellar space. So without something to keep the atoms in an excited state, even if you start with everything in the excited state, in time $\tau$ you will find that everything has decayed to the ground state, with the exception of some very small fraction $\tau_{\textrm{ion}} / \tau$, which may have moved up to a higher energy state. Assuming the lifetimes of those very excited states are comparable, after a few more times $\tau$, you will find that even those will have decayed to the ground state.
