Do vipassana, a retreat if possible. In every moment you have a memory, know that it is a memory, know about feelings which are coming up and so on. Your mind is in the habit of believing the images, but in fact what you see is just mental noise. Maybe you had past lives like that, but it does not matter (I bet you think it does matter; that's exactly the power these images have over you). The training in returning back to the present moment (by acknowledging whatever is happening and letting it go, time and again) will gradually break the attachment of mind to those images, so you will be able to stay more stable even if these images come. Whatever in the mind is not a hindrance to be present, if seen clearly for what it is (body sensation, feeling, mind, mind object -- technically speaking); present cannot be destroyed but we are sometimes unable to tune in back to it, and that's why we train. As a side note: if your condition is psychiatric (you are not able to take care of yourself in regular matters, often can't distinguish hallucinations from reality etc), do seek proper treatment first. 

Drug obsession is a problem of the first training; get rid of that obsession using suitable means (I'd give +50 points to Jeff's answer, it is great); they are designed for that -- by smart people who knew something about drugs. Meditation is not designed for dealing with drugs; while it could theoretically help (since it cleanses craving in general), in practice one would not be able to handle the strain of suffering being brought up, since a relatively stable psychological basis is missing. Even MBSR will not let you in unless you are 1 year clean; and that is relatively light practice. 

Ajahn Tong Sirimangalo (who is the teacher of @yuttadhammo, mentioned in other answers) was a student of (among others) Mahasi Saydaw and developed a course structure using Mahasi-style noting and walking/sitting meditation (2-4 weeks foundational course, 10-day retreats). He was an abbot of several temples in Thailand (Wat Ram Poeng, then moving to Chom Tong). The international section of his monastery in Chom Tong, Thailand, headed by Thanat Chindaporn, coordinates a number of teachers and retreat centers around the world: Germany ($URL$ Israel ($URL$ Czech Republic ($URL$ IIRC Mexico, plus a number of occasional retreat events elsewhere (Brazil, France, ...). 

To each of the various planes of existence is naturally assigned a definite age-limit, irrespective of the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma that has yet to run. One must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit is reached. It may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is extremely powerful, the Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some higher plane as in the case of the devas. 

The first three types of death are collectively called kālamarana (timely death), and the last one is known as akālamarana (untimely death). An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owing to any of the following four causes, namely, the exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, and some extraneous cause like the gust of a wind. Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the aforesaid four ways. 

Recollection of the memory is not attending to the present but attending to sanna (past perception that has been stored). The best the recollection of the memory can do is inform one of the path that one has travelled and probably one can help other people along the same path. The continued perception of arising and passing away of dhammas will deepen the insight into the three characteristics. Each stage of the breakthrough occurs because one has clearer and clearer insights of the 3 characteristics and able to let go of further attachments until nothing sticks, and everything slips like "a drop of water on a lotus leaf". Even at the stage of an Anagami, Khemaka still watch further the arising and passing away of dhammas. 

Vajrayana(Primordial mind, clear light and Primordial Buddha) In Vajrayana the primodial mind ((Wylie: 'hod-gsal, 'od gsal), Clear light (Sanskrit prabhasvara)or "Radiant Light": 

If I strike a white cue ball hard on a billard table, someone without an understanding of the transfer of momentum would say every thing that happen subsequently, happen by chance. Someone who sees the cue ball approaching a pack of balls could ask why should we expect any thing to happen to the pack of balls, there is no reason for it. When subsequently all the balls come to rest in a particular configuration, someone else would say God arranged it. So it is understandable when God strike the white ball rolling he meant it to send some balls into the pockets of hell an others in perpetual purgatory. Someone else who have encountered both these views, will say that the view that the transfer of momentum from one ball to the rests that it come into contact are no different from the view of god. The function of the transfer of momentum is no different from the function carried out by a personal god. And the transfer of momentum is still a supernatural agency, and so on... What can you say to that? They are views that arise without an understanding of transfer of momentum or kamma. This is just an analogy! Please don't take me to task on this analogy. Some times when we don't SEE for ourself (Paccattam Veditabbo Vinnuhi) an underlying truth. Every view is possible! So when we "see for ourself"(Paccattam Veditabbo Vinnuhi) the workings of kamma then certain views are impossible, others are not plausible and we arrive to right views. The only convincing evidence is to see our own past lives and if we are unable to do that, the other alternative is to have some faith in the saying of someone like the Buddha. If we can't do both, as in having no ability and no faith and no practice, we remain as we are full of delusion/confusion as to what are the right views. Practice leads to knowing for ourselves and also results in more confidence in the dhamma. It starts with practice and ends in knowing (vijja or bodhi). 

Mental labeling is the act of saying 'sad' or 'happy', when such thoughts occur, without wanting anything to be different. The last part is important, because it means we are recognizing our states for what they are, but not judging them from the perspective of generating aversion of craving. Judging always has a little flavor of wanting or 'not wanting', or at least an opinion about something being good or bad. Labelling on the other hand is recognizing (and being with) what's there without any of the attached filters of the mind as Joseph Goldstein calls them. Perhaps not directly related to your question, but cultivating the right state of mind does sometimes involve discerning. However, the difference is in what we discern. We only discern our own state of mind as either skillful or unskillful in dealing with what is arising in the present moment. We do not judge that which is arising however. 

I read somewhere (don't remember where) that the Buddha mentioned, that he has taught only a fraction of what he could discern with his eye of wisdom (about existence). Does anyone know which Sutra describes this? 

I feel a little stressed out when I move my attention through the body to observe the sensations. I am able to meditate far better if I focus on the entire body as a whole and feel sensations wherever they come up. Is this acceptable in the S. N. Goenka Vipassana technique or is it important that a mediator scan the body part by part? 

Most things that we read about in Buddhism describe aspects of the conditioned world: Three Marks of Existence, The Skandhas, The Hindrances, Defilements, and the practice to overcome these and gain insight into the true nature of reality and enter the unborn to gain final freedom from the cycle of birth and death. I would like to read about the unborn: what it is, how/why conditioned existence comes into being (perhaps from the unborn?), etc. I think this is one of the things which the Buddha left unanswered, but did he describe it indirectly perhaps? Are there descriptions in the sutras (from any school of Buddhism) about the unborn/deathless state? 

I find this helpful (Ajahn Tong: Path to Nibbana, complete edition, pg. [some thai numeral, sorry!]): 

Theory: if you don't acknowledge positive state, you are likely to become more attached to it and have suffering when it ceases (that's what the mind does automatically: liking → craving → (later) disappointment). You've known this for sure. Practically speaking (but I am only guessing based on what you write) you should acknowledge/note very carefully: 

I would suggest you try another vipassana lineage. Goenka goes for body sensations only (AFAIK, later they add mind objects, but I only have 2nd-hand knowledge about it). Use a technique where all 4 foundations (body, feelings, mind, mind objects) are used from the very start could be useful; I am personally doing Chomtong-style practice (Ajahn Tong, a variant of Mahasi, dry-vipassana with lower concentration) and being exposed to e.g. difficult feelings and learn to acknowledge them and let go is extremely valuable for me. What I also find very useful is to have regular interviews with teacher on the retreat. Meditation has good results if you have more clarity, understanding or yourself and others etc; in short, if your life is better. Experiences come and go and have little long-term relevance (despite the mind trying to persuade us this is it in that moment). 

Start with a Vipassana retreat. Buddha sates clearly that the goal is the attainment of Nibbana by the practice of Vipassana. I am fan of Thai-style (Ajahn Tong) Mahasi tradition (don't worry if this means nothing to you), they do a 3-week "basic course" which is suitable even for people who never meditated before. Something like that will give you a good taste how meditation makes you a better person and will build up your confidence (in the practice and in your ability to meditate), something books will never give you. Good luck! 

The supramundane state (cessation) is termed magga-ñana the first time attained, and phala-ñana any subsequent times attained (on that same level -- 1st path, 2nd, 3rd, 4th). The path knowledge (magga-ñana) is attained only once for each path, ever. The first attainment is thus stream entry (sotapatti). The cycle of insight then starts over, and you may attain the fruition (phala-ñana) of the path which had been attained any number of times, and for extended periods of time, if desired and trained. When the mind attains the knowledge of arising&passing (udaybbaya-ñana) of the second path, the cycle of insight will happen again on a higher level, possibly culminating in knowledge of the second path (magga-ñana; and the yogi may then again re-experience fruition of the second path many times. Don't ask me how the fruition differs between 1st and 2nd path, when it is utter unconsciousness (everything ceases: including space, time, consciousness) without anything to be said about it -- I don't know. 

In Mahayana schools of Chan/Zen Buddhism, the alaya-vjnana is identical with the tathagata-garbha, and is fundamentally pure. Mahayana other schools, starts with the interpretation of the Luminous Mind (Prabhasvara citta) 

In a bit more detail of the conditions that leads to one practising or not: “If I arise and cease dependent on other things then where does my own effort come into it? If I decide to practice the Dharma how does that come about? Isn't my decision to practice just the interplay of causes in a big interconnected web?” It is not only our effort which gets us to continue our practice, there are lots of skilful/unskilful conditions that conditioned us. I’ve listed them down with their conditions. It is not exhaustive but just an indication of how complex are these interplay of conditions. There is also the repetition (habit) condition (Asevana paccayo) when we do our practice daily. i. There are six Roots Condition (Hetu paccayo): 

There is no samatha jhana nor is there vipassana jhana mentioned in the suttas, I may have missed it! There are the 4 rupa jhanas mentioned with each containing various jhana factors and 4 arupa jhanas. IMHO, the distinction is made to rationalise some meditation practices which dispense with the development of jhanas as a necessary step. 

Commentary and critique: Kapstein (2004: p.124) in mentioning the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā and Haribhadra states: 

Definitions Patrul Rinpoche et al. (1994: p.410; p.403) define 'Clear light' (Tibetan: 'od gsal) as the: 

So Tantrayana as far as I know is another name for Vajrayana which is different from Shingon and other Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. Tantrayana or Vajrayana is the latest 10th century tradition which includes the highest yoga tantra (Anuttarayogatantra). 

The Ariyas are "breast born" sons and daughters of the Buddha and they sometimes address each other as elder brother or sister as a mark of respect, according to their accomplishments. Given that it is a council of Arahants, would it even occur to them to notice that there is a distinction, even in terms of class or sex amongst them, and that distinction is marked enough to make a separate representative body, which participation somehow adds or detracts something on the authority of the council? The council of Arahants would look more suspicious if it was thought that some of those distinctions were relevant and recorded. The patimokkha is different, in that, later it was made up of ariyas and putthujannas and the rules of the women were slightly different and more than the men. 

Acoording to the Theravada tradition (or more precisely, the Mahasi tradition), Nibbana is state which is achieved towards the end of the insight cycle (magga-nana and phala-nana, fruition, called also "touch of Nibbana"); it is a state of extinction of consciousness, so there is nothing which can be said about it, there is no experience at all, and only when consciousness reappears, there is the knowledge that something has happened. It is said to have profound effect on the mind in destroying defilements. The state is termed supramundane, since there is nothing "mundane" (no time, no space, no consciousness). Kenneth Folk talks about this in his excellent inverview at $URL$ . 

Some insight into 3 characteristics is gained at every stage, though the depth (and thus the transformative power) of this insight is different, and also type of objects in which 3c are seen are different as one moves through the stages of insight. One goes forward through the stages by understanding more and more of 3c. 

Personal opinion based on my experience: go for a retreat again, if you can. It has more benefit (as a rule of thumb) to do intense practice than the same amount of time diluted over a bigger timespan. Rather than 1 hour every morning, do 20 minutes every morning and a one 10-day retreat a year. I am a big fan of the Mahasi-style practice, and it was developed primarily for retreats; works in daily activities as well, but the foundation is intense practice. 

The Chom Tong tradition (linked in the answer above for Thailand already) also has a number of centers in Europe and around (incomplete list): 

When training mindfulness (Vipassana), there are 4 foundations of mindfulness: body, feelings, mind, mental objects. "Mental objects" (also "mind objects", or "mind qualities") are usually sub-divided into 5 hindrances and 7 factors of enlightenment. Fear (also under the name of anxiety, worry, depending on translation) is one of the 5 hindrances. When practicing Vipassana based on 4 foundations of mindfulness (such as in the Mahasi tradition), fear is definitely something to be contemplated (acknowledged), acquainted with, mindful of. By acknowledging it every time it arises, it loses (some of) its magic power it has over an untrained mind, and is seen progressively more and more as a "mental object", something which passes through the mind; thus is the mind purified of fear.
