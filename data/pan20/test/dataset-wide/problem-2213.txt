The match is over as soon as the batsmen complete their first run, so the last five points (from "Player X turns back for another run") are irrelevant. Quoting specifically Law 21.6 Winning hit or extras: 

In the men's 1500m at the 2012 Olympics, Abdalaati Iguider ran 3:34.00 in the 2nd semi-final. The final was won by Taoufik Makhloufi in a time of 3:34.08. In the men's 5000m, Mo Farah won with a time of 13:41.66, a time which would have placed him in the middle of the field in either of the heats. The fastest time was Dejen Gebremeskel at 13:15.15, 25s quicker than the winning time in the final. Your criteria are also met in the women's 1500m, women's 5000m and men's 3000m steeplechase. Given how easy it was to find those (I just started with the track and field events at the most recent Olympics and worked up through the distances), I suspect this is a not uncommon occurrence, particularly in the longer distance events where races can be more tactical. In particular, the "fastest N losers qualify" rule will tend to force qualifying rounds to be quick to give athletes the best chance of making the finals, but there's no such pressure in the final. 

then by all means keep doing it. However, if you are interested in moving up to a higher standard of play, you'll probably find players and/or teams who are adept at shutting down a one-dimensional player, either by putting a "shut down" defender on you, or by adjusting their team defense so that you're denied the ball in the first place. At that point, if you've got nothing else to fall back on then you're going to struggle. 

so India will have been given an allowance of three minutes for the wickets which did fall in the last over. 

The libero has not definitely committed a fault. As you note, the crucial rule here is 11.2.2.2; quoting from the 2017-2020 rules: 

That answers the general question for "international matches". For more specific tournaments, The 2018 World Cup Regulations (Section 24.4) contain similar language, but unhelpfully make no definition of "host team" that I can see. I can't see anything in the 2016 European Championship Regulations about kits. Just to add to the confusion, there was at least one World Cup match, the Brazil vs Sweden semifinal in 1994, when both teams wore their away kits. I can't find a reference at the moment, but my memory says that their was a coin toss to determine who would wear their home kit (as both teams traditionally wear yellow and blue), but the away kit of the losing team still clashed with the yellow and blue, so both teams played in their away kits. 

That's the idea. You'll get fitter and therefore be a better player by doing them. When it gets to double overtime in a playoff game, you'll appreciate those minutes doing conditioning because you'll have the extra step on the opposition. 

I think it's simply not the case that soccer players die of cardiac issues more than other sports. Quoting from this New York Daily News article: 

Assuming that the contact between the players occurred on the Brazilan side of the net, my understanding would be that this is a blocking fault by the Italian. Specifically quoting from Rule 14.3, "Blocking within the opponent's space": 

As of May 2018, there have been three Test matches won after a team followed on (winning team listed first): 

Merckx also won all three individual time trials (excluding the prologue), three other stages, the "combativity" classification, and somewhat unsurprisingly by this point, the combination" classification. His team, FAEMA, won both the team competition and the team time trial. Eric Leman did win the intermediate sprints classification so it wasn't a complete clean sweep. 

Yes, there are cricketers who play with prosthetic limbs, for example Tom Carter who plays recreational cricket in Wales. In the near future, I suspect it's very unlikely that an athletes with a prosthetic limb will compete with able bodied athletes at a much higher level than that due to the limitations that even the best prosthetics place on movement and balance. On the other hand, there are of course various forms of cricket designed for athletes with disabilities, whether they be physical disabilities or mental disabilities; of particular note are blind cricket and deaf cricket. 

The ladies semi-finals at Wimbledon are, unless delayed, played on the second Thursday of the Championship so the match will have been on the 1st July. (The men's semi-finals follow on the Friday, followed by the ladies final on the Saturday). I don't think there are any situations in which the ladies semi-final would be pulled forwards to the Wednesday. This is supported by the BBC News report of the match which is at 15:25 GMT on the 1st July. 

The point is that a tie does affect your net run rate in that it pulls in back towards zero. Consider a hypothetical example where a team has played one match, scored 200 in its 50 overs and conceded only 100. Their net run rate is now (200 - 100) / 50 = 2.00. Now add in a tie where both teams score 150 (doesn't actually matter what the score is): the net run rate is now ((200 + 150) - (100 + 150)) / 100 = 1.00; while the absolute difference in the number of runs has not changed (that's the definition of a tie!), the number of overs being considered has increased, so the net run rate always has a smaller magnitude after the tie than before. As Cricinfo point out, the situation is different if the match is abandoned as that Ireland's run rate does not change. 

I'd disagree that MLS has really begun to draw high caliber European players. Both of the two examples you cite, Steven Gerrard and David Villa, are players approaching the end of their careers, which isn't that different from the previous higher profile European players who have played in MLS like David Beckham or Thierry Henry. I'm not aware of any current European internationals who play in MLS. There may be one or two from some smaller countries, but I think that's fairly indicative of the level of players currently in MLS. 

This means that the first example (kicking and then hitting the chest) is not a fault as it was part of one action. However, this exception does not apply to an attempt to play the ball overhand, so the second example (attempting to set and then hitting the face) would be a fault. Note that even if the attempt to set were successful, that would likely be called a fault due to how the "catch" and "double touch" rules are interpreted in beach volleyball. 

Well, it depends on the rules of the competition! But if as per your title, you're concerned about away goals, then your team will have lost: 

A ball cannot stump a batsman; that can only be accomplished by the wicket-keeper. If you mean the ball hits the wicket and permanently dislodges the bails, then the batsman is out bowled. 

As such, there's no need for any markings on the pitch, as it is determined by the information from the DRS cameras, not by the on-field umpires. 

Run rate is defined as runs / (legal deliveries * 6) - i.e. runs per over. As the number of legal deliveries is zero, the current run rate is undefined. This is just the same as (e.g.) how a batsman's average is undefined if they have played only one innings and were not out - but frankly, it doesn't matter because everything fixes itself once a legal delivery occurs. 

Yes. The NHL spent 25 years with only six teams (the "Original Six" era), and to some extent only three of those teams were competitive, so this has happened many times. Going even further back (to the 1920s), the playoffs were just a matchup between the top two teams, so this was guaranteed to happen. 

All we can really tell you here is what Durant himself said about the move. Quoting from this ESPN article, Durant said: 

On 27th June 2017, Spencer Foo signed with the Calgary Flames as a "college free agent". My naive understanding of the NHL was that entry-level players came in via two routes: 

The Laws of the Game make no mention of what happens when a match is abandoned. The result will be determined by the governing body responsible for the match - note that exactly the same applies if only one team is reduced to fewer than seven players, although in that case the governing body probably has an easier job sorting things out. 

That is just a bad definition of "passing yards" - as can be seen from (for example) this boxscore, passing yards are most definitely counted for individual players (Flacco and Mallett for the Ravens in this case), rather than just for the team as a whole. As you've noted, finding a formal definition of this is a bit tricky. The best I can do at the moment is the "Passing & Sacks (Offensive)" section of the NFL Guide for Statisticians; this has multiple references to "the passer" being credited for pass attempts, rather than "the team" or any other language. The other half of your question is somewhat easier to answer: 

As for why that was the rule chosen by the NFL, you're into the area of speculation, but a challenge is in some ways similar to a timeout in that it gives players a chance to catch their breath, make substitutions etc. Obviously it doesn't stop the clock, but there has to be something to stop teams being able to throw a spurious challenge flag purely to slow things down. 

At the moment, this isn't standard equipment for umpires; only Bruce Oxenford is using it at the moment as far as I'm aware. As such, I'm guessing this is a personal piece of equipment that Oxenford is using and as such it doesn't have a formal name, but yes, it's obviously for the umpire to use as protection from the ball. For what it's worth, this isn't the first time Oxenford has used the "shield" - he also used it in the Australia vs West Indies World T20 warm up match earlier in 2016. 

This depends on when the hand and the bat became separated. If the bat became separated before the batsman made their ground, then the batsman is out as they never made their ground. If the batsman made their ground with their bat but then dropped the bat, they are considered to still be in their ground; quoting Law 30.2: 

Yes, although it may not be explicit. Every sport has structures in place which allow the governing body (the NHL in this case) to penalise teams for conduct "detrimental to or against the welfare of the League or the game of hockey"1. Deliberately losing matches would be a prime example of this. What actually happens if the league decides to go after a team on these grounds is either undefined or not public - perhaps the closest analogy is when the NHL fined the New Jersey Devils both money and draft picks for attempting to violate the salary cap; at that point, even ESPN were unclear as to the exact details: 

What happens if two (or more!) teams are still tied after all four tiebreakers is possibly an open question. 

Specifically, in that match, there were 220 shots of which only 46 were made (21%) - and that includes shots from all distances. Looking at "long distance" shots, the ratio drops to 22 / 141, or just under 16%. That's significantly below the three-point shooting percentage in the NBA (around a third). Unless some hard statistics are provided which show that korfball players really do make a much greater percentage of their shots than in that match, I'm not seeing any strong evidence (or really any evidence at all) that NBA-quality shooters would be better off shooting from significantly beyond the three-point line. This also fits with what the statistical analysis of the NBA tells us: while the stats heads may be correct in pointing out that the three-point shot is an underutilized tactic in modern day basketball, we're not talking about a few points per game, not a "world changing" tactic that everyone would adopt in seconds. While professional sports coaches may be somewhat conservative when it comes to new tactics, they're not stupid - if something is so clearly better than the current tactics, they'll do it. 

No goal. This is a basic rule of football: it's the position of the ball that matters, not the players. Specifically quoting from the Laws of the Game, Law 10 - The Method of Scoring (page 35): 

Because there's no restriction on how long the first team can bat. Imagine a ridiculously flat track where batting is very easy - the team winning the toss decides to bat, and bats for four days, scoring 1000 runs or so. The second team now begins their innings, and by the end of the fifth day has reached 300 without loss. Why should they be declared the loser? Test Match cricket, or more generally timed cricket, involves a different set of skills from limited overs cricket - building pressure and taking wickets is paramount, run rate less so. 

Welcome to the "Art of Refereeing"! I think the best answer to this is from the foreward to the FIVB rulebook (page 10): 

In particular, this means that you can't score runs by kicking away balls which pitch outside leg stump. 

(my emphasis). In your example, the whole of the ball has not crossed the goal line, so no goal is scored. 

Practically, the question pretty much comes down to whether there was any deception on the part of the fielding side or not - if they made it clear that the play was over (for example by throwing the ball around, shining it, etc), then 23.1(b) applies, the ball is dead and the batsman cannot be dismissed. If the keeper just kept the ball and waited for you to wander out of your crease, that's fair game. As 23.2 makes clear, it's for the umpire to judge what happens here. Nothing here matters if it was a wide or not - the ball explicitly does not become dead on a call of wide; see Law 25.4: 

To a large extent, a utility player is still a utility player and is still valuable. In analytic terms, even if a player is only replacement level1 at the positions he plays, then it still carries value to the team in terms of roster flexibility. To take a slightly more specific example, imagine two teams: 

No. As soon as a batsman is out, the ball is dead so there is no way to get two run outs in one ball. The only exception is to get a "regular" run out on a ball, and then to run out the non-striker backing up ("Mankading") before the next ball is delivered.
