It is classical that $L^1(G, m)$ is a Banach algebra when $G$ is a locally compact group with Haar measure $m$ by using the operation of convolution via the integral $$(f*g)(y)=\int_Xf(x)g(yx^{-1})\,dm(x)$$ I'm interested in knowing if there is a natural Banach algebra structure on $L^1(X, \mathcal{B},\mu)$ for a locally compact, Hausdorff measure space $X$, with a Borel sigma algebra, $\mathcal{B}$ and radon measure, $\mu$ with the added assumption that the measure is induced by a (say normalized) Haar measure on a compact abelian group, $G$. In particular, the situation I'm most interested in is $$X=\coprod_{n\in\mathbb{N}} X_n$$ with each $X_n$ a compact space topologically a homogeneous $G$-space, i.e. a quotient space $G/H_n$ with $H_n$ closed subgroups of $G$. With these assumptions I can define just such a measure on $X$ by first taking $f\in C(X_n)$ and selecting any point $x_n\in X_n$ and using the normalized Haar measure $m$ on $G$, setting $$I_n(F)=\int_G f(\tau x_n)\,dm(\tau)$$ Since $G$ acts transitively on its coset spaces, this integral is independent of choice of $x_n$. Then, on $X$, I define for $F\in C_c(X)$ $$I(F)=\sum_n I_n(F\cdot 1_{X_n})$$ Since $F$ has compact support, this sum is well-defined (being finite). I know that, since $I(F)$ is a linear functional, it is represented by integration against a Radon measure, $\lambda$ on $X$ and by construction and the transitivity on the pieces, this measure is invariant under the action of $G$, that is to say, there is a radon measure $\mu$ on $X$ and a $\sigma$-algebra, $\Sigma$, containing the Borel $\sigma$-algebra so that for every $F\in L^1(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ $$I(F)=\int_X F\,d\mu.$$ Moreover it is clear from the definition that this has the property that $$\int_{X_n}F(x)\,d\mu(x)=\int_{X_n}F(\tau x)\,d\mu(x)$$ for every $\tau\in G$ and $F\in L^1(X)$. By writing $$F=\sum_n F\cdot 1_{X_n}$$ we can see now that $$\int_X F\,d\mu=\sum_n F(x)1_{X_n}\,d\mu(x)$$ $$=\sum_n\int_{X_n}F(x)\,d\mu=\sum_n \int_{X_n}F(\tau x)\,d\mu(x)$$ $$=\int_X F(\tau x)\,d\mu(x).$$ This establishes that the measure $\mu$ is invariant under $G$. Now, $X$ itself lacks a group structure, but can we still somehow define a Banach algebra structure on $L^1(X)$ by using the fact that the measure $\mu$ is essentially pushing forward the measure $m$ on $G$ and $G$ does have the structure of a compact group? Edit (Adam): I've added the fact about the $X_n$ being homogeneous spaces of $G$ by subgroups and clarified the invariance of $\mu$ under the $G$-action. 

That should only be true for things which have $\mathbb{R}^n$ as their universal covering space. In particular I think it fails for things like Lens spaces. 

I recommend $\lambda$-Rings and the Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group by Donald Knutson. It helped me a lot. It's #308 in the Springer Lecture Notes series. 

If you look at Steve Awodey's book Category Theory (Oxford Logic Guides * 49) you'll see that on p. 22, Definition 1.12 is that a category in which $\hom_\mathbf{C}(A,B)$ is a set for every pair of objects $A$ and $B$ is called locally small. 

Say I have a ring, $R$, with 1 which I consider my universe, and I know its group of units $G=\mathbb{G}_m(R)$. Then given a subgroup, $H\le G$, can I determine if there is there a subring $S_H$ such that $\mathbb{G}_m(S)=H$? If so, is $S_H$ unique with this group of units? If so, is there in fact a--canonical in the sense above--1-1 correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and subrings of $R$ with 1? Preliminary attempts at a solution don't indicate any problems with the truth of the statement, but naturally one should be skeptical of limited data especially in a subject with so many intricacies as groups and rings. The motivating example is $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}$, due to some interesting number theory that could come out of such a correspondence. In the case of fields the question is supposed to collapse into the question "Can I add 0 to a subgroup of the group of units of some big field and get a subfield without doing anything else?" There is no possibility for general rings, but are there assumptions on $R$ or $G$ which can ensure existence or uniqueness? And it is also fine to induce assumptions on what kind of $S$ we are allowed to have as well, fields instead of just rings for example. 

Wiener's theorem gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of translates of a set of functions to be dense in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which translates algebraically into a statement about the closed ideals of the $C^*$ algebra, $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$. It is known that $L^1(G)$ is a $C^*$ algebra for general groups, and that the algebra is commutative iff $G$ is. In the case $G$ is abelian, the result implies that the PNT is equivalent to $\zeta(1+it)\ne 0$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}$ after using Wiener's theorem to prove the Wiener-Ikehara theorem, and ultimately provides a very efficient proof of this result, ultimately depending on the fact that functions with non-vanishing Fourier transforms (on $\mathbb{R}^n$) are those which are not in any maximal ideal of the Fourier algebra. In the case $G\ne\mathbb{R}^n$ but is still abelian, there is still a notion of "Fourier" transform, more appropriately called the Gelfand transform, which is a genuine generalization of the classical Fourier transform. In the case $G$ is not commutative, then this paper provides a notion of Gelfand transform for the algebra which generalizes the one for the case $G$ is abelian, now with characters of $G$ replaced by unitary representations. If one has, say, a compact group, $G$, which is not abelian, what kinds of analogous results can be obtained from a set of functions $\{f_i\}_{i\in I}\subseteq L^1(G)$ such that their generalized Gelfand transforms have no common zero? What kind of tauberian theorems come out of this, if any? 

Is there any way to tell the number of distinct ways to factor $a\in\mathcal{O}_k$ (up to units, of course) when $k$ is not a PID? A simple investigation in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ with integer ring $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ and Galois group $G=\langle\sigma\rangle$, with $\alpha = \sqrt{-5}$, gives, for example (and this is incredibly basic, but in case we have algebra people not familiar with the computations of number theorists or outside interested parties to motivate the question). $6=\begin{cases} 2\cdot 3 \\ (1+\alpha)(1-\alpha)\end{cases}\qquad (*)$ Since $\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ is integrally closed, we can look mod 2 and mod 3 to find factorizations for $(2)$ and $(3)$, which gives $m_\alpha(x)\equiv (x+1)^2\mod 2$ and $m_\alpha(x)\equiv (x-1)(x-2)\mod 3$, and so $(2)$ ramifies as $(2,1+\alpha)^2=\mathfrak{p}_1^2=\mathfrak{p}_2^2$ (the reason for using two labels for the same ideal will be clear later) and since $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}}(1+\alpha)=6$, we know $(2,1+\alpha)$ is not principal, so $2$ is an irreducible integer, and similarly for $(3)=(3,\alpha-1)(3,\alpha -2)=(3,1-\alpha)(3,1+\alpha)=\mathfrak{p}_3\mathfrak{p}_4$ to show 3 is irreducible, and $1\pm\alpha$ are irreducible by norm calculations as well. So in this case we'd like to see that $(*)$ produces all of the factorizations of $6$ into irreducibles. So we need only look at ideals above 2 and 3. Since $h_k\,(=|\text{Pic}(\mathcal{O}_k)|)$ any pairing of two of the four (we need to count the ramifying prime twice, of course, and this is why we double counted it earlier) ideals we've produced multiply to an irreducible in some factorization of 6 so we see that of the ${4\choose 2}=3$ ways to do this, but clearly matching 1 with 3 is the same as matching 1 with 4 because $\mathfrak{p}_1=\mathfrak{p}_2$. I'd like to know if there is a general way to tell the total number of factorizations of a given number in an integer ring, $\mathcal{O}_k$ for a number field, $k$. If this is too hard, then I'm also willing to settle on number of factorizations for a rational integer where we are allowed to use integers from $\mathcal{O}_k$ in the factorization. Obviously the combinatorics of the problem mean that there is not just one number for the entire field, simply looking at the number 12 in the example above illustrates why this is. However some easy reductions: If we look at the ideal factorization, we can always ignore inert primes, as they clearly have no contribution to making more factorizations, moreover we can ignore principal primes, but these are harder to detect with simple tricks if the norm of the element given to us by a factorization in some reduction with a coprime conductor (this also illustrates the problem when we cannot find a ring with trivial conductor in our integer ring). If the class number (again, I don't know if algebraists use the same terminology, so I'll clarify: this is the number $h_k=|\text{Pic}(\mathcal{O}_k)|$) is 2, then we know we can select non-principal ideals and their product is principal and that the product ideal is generated by an irreducible element without any further information about the exact structure of $\text{Pic}(\mathcal{O}_k)$. One might argue that one need only pair inverse (non-trivial) classes of primes together to get more information, but as far as I know detecting the exact ideal class of a non-trivial element when $h_k>2$ is a non-trivial feat, but then this is not my prime area of expertise, and I would love to be proven wrong on that front. EDIT: It seems reasonable that if you have an ideal $\mathfrak{a}=\prod\mathfrak{p}_i^{e_i}$ that if you could detect the ideal classes of the $\mathfrak{p}_i$ you could manage to pair them up based on the abelian group decomposition of the class group into a direct sum of cyclic groups and reducing the question to finding group inverses with minimal exponents for the representing ideal powers, but it's not clear if this would be a prescription for every possibility or not. 

I've been scouring google and asking friend about something I was certain must be absolutely the easiest thing to people who do homological algebra, and none seem to know the answer to this, so if it's something really easy, I apologize. The setup is relatively simple, I have a profinite group, $G$, and a sequence of $G$-modules--that is to say $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ modules-- $$1\to X_0\to X_1\to X_2\to 1$$ Given a trivial $G$ module, $R$ which is injective as an abelian group, I'd like to analyze the Galois cohomology groups, $H^*(G, R\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} X_i)$ given knowledge of $H^*(G, X_i)$. If it helps at all, one can assume I'm talking about $R=\mathbb{R}$, as even that case would be of great use. As far as I can tell, with a trivial $G$ action, $R$ is a flat $G$ module, so the snake lemma still applies to the modified sequence. The main problem I have is finding any result which indicates how the new cohomology groups relate to the old ones. Furthermore, if I have a $\mathbb{Q}[G]$ module, $V$--that is, a vector space with a continuous $G$ action--how can I compute $H^*(G, \mathbb{F}\widehat{\otimes}_{\mathbb{Q}}V)$ where $\mathbb{F}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and the hat means I intend to complete my vector space $\mathbb{F}\otimes V$ with respect to some topology (my case is a norm topology if that helps at all). Is it just the same as $H^*(G,\mathbb{F}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}V)$--i.e. does completion affect anything? (I'm inclined to think not, as the $\mathbb{F}$ are endowed with a trivial $G$ action, but I'm not enough of an expert to be confident of that.) If so, is then $H^*(G, \mathbb{F}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}V)$ the same as $H^*(G, V)$ or a simple operation away from $H^*(G,V)$? Edit: The answer posted by user 43326 makes me realize that I must have gotten the wrong tensor, it should be over $\mathbb{Q}$ (or even $\mathbb{Z}$) and not, $\mathbb{Q}[G]$ since the latter trvializes the $G$ action, which should not happen.
