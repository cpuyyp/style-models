Only in non-text search The vast majority of the internet is already very well indexed by key word and can be searched in "a fraction of a second" a quick sample of google searches shows they complete in under 3/5th of a second. Most of the time spent learning from the internet is not in finding the information but in understanding it translating it from words on a screen to structures in you head. When you want to look up what quetzalcoatl was what fraction of the time do you spend getting to the Wikipedia page and what fraction do you spend reading it? Any student of foreign language will tell you that reading mi llamo es means my name is not the same as knowing it. Max can remember the contents of the page but does not necessarily understand them. Its like having instant recall of all physics text books you won't instantly become an expert, because most fields call on you to apply knowledge not just regurgitate it. He will be great at trivia though. He is also limited by processing power and encryption. Just because he has more memory than a server farm does not grant him the thought/processing speed of a computer. He may be able to look up a formula for a math question quickly but then he has to solve it at the same rate as the rest of us. His normal math ability also means he not have any special ability to break into encrypted information. What will he be good at? Current search systems are really bad at searching anything that is not text. Image based search is still very inaccurate. Audio search only works on a very carefully defined limited data set, published recorded music. There is no smell or taste search. Max would be amazing at any field were recognizing things other than by text was common. Doctor does this spot look cancerous? Spotting spies like Chuck with the intersect. Where was this picture taken? These are questions he can answer well. 

We farm and work in loop groups We need to grow food to have a large surplus of food to allow for civilization. We have to move every 48 hours and can't return in the near future (at least a few weeks). If it is safe for others to be in these areas then our crops that are left unguarded they will be eaten and destroyed either by animals or other humans. We will evolve to have rotating groups. Say we can't return for 4 weeks (then we need 14 sites) we stay and work and farm at a site for 48 hours then move to the next one. If the reason we move is because the old site becomes unsafe, we just leave it and assume our crops will not be touched by other humans, we just come back and get them 4 weeks later. Perhaps hiding or fencing off our food and tools to protect them. If the area is safe for other humans just not us then we split the tribe into 14 groups. Each works and guards a site for 2 days and then moves on to the next one. That way all sites are guarded at all times The cycle avoids us having to carry all our possessions with us and still lets agriculture and construction develop. We would develop a huge sense of trust since most or our possessions are guarded by someone else most of the time. 

Fabricators remove the need for goods but not services A fabricator will make you a new car but it doesn't preform services like collecting trash, making new songs, giving haircuts or doing surgery. Manufacturing jobs and companies would vanish but service jobs would continue. People in your society would still desperately need the services of garbage collectors, artists, hairstylists, doctors and the vast set of service professions. Some services might be preformed by robots but from the description robots are like current robots and can preform few tasks. Currency would still exist since people need other to pay other people to do services for them. Since currency exists the government hires employees to preform the service of collecting taxes. Currency would have to be something nonphysical or hard to replicate, like electronic bank records today, valuable information, or energy. None of which a replicator could duplicate. 

There are tons of other areas where science is thundering ahead not just Computer science and medicine. And there may be great inventions in those fields that we donâ€™t see coming, Einstein was famously told not to go into physics because all the great discoveries had already been made in that field. For space the most interesting fields of research are in material science. As the techniques for making longer and purer carbon nanotube chains are perfected to possibility of constructing a space elevator can become a reality. That would reduce the cost of space travel by a factor of a hundred or a thousand and make thousands of commercial applications of space travel viable. Another area of growth could be the refinements in oxygen based batteries which could be 2 x3 times more power dense than our current lithium ion batteries. PS the fields of distributed and parallel computing are actively building ways to continue to build more powerful computing systems without using faster chips. 

Bridging the air gap First why are you shooting projectiles to hack? Well it must mean that you have limited / no access to the system and you are using this odd tool to open a new attack vector. The simple version of this is an air gapped or firewalled system. It is also true that some newer operating systems offer different authentication methods for a local user rather than remote (camera authentication is now available) these might be easier to attack then the modes accessible through the internet. How does the projectile interface with the machine? This is the hard part computer parts and ports tend to be small enough so a miss by more than a millimeter will make the system fail. So you need to be freakishly accurate but also "hit" lightly enough to not damage the port or component you are attaching to. The first idea that springs to mind is to have a frame the pads the landing and attaches to the outside of machine the frame then detects the location of the port (usb or whatever you desire) and connect to it. This gives you a stationary and stable platform to preform the delicate connection. The added weight of the frame and the high accuracy requirement make this a better candidate for launch by computer sighted launcher than a human archer ... unless the archer has the super ability of ludicrous accuracy. 

What do you mean nonmonetary system? There are 2 major uses of money. A medium of exchange: You are paid dollars which you have no direct use for, unless you really like paper with president's faces on it. But you know other people will trade you other things for the dollars, so you take them with the plan to trade it latter. This was addressed by O.M.'s answer. A unified bench mark of value: How much is that chicken worth? 5 gallons of milk 1/4 a cow or $50. There are thousands of things in the world instead of remembering conversion rates between any two items we just remember the conversion rates for everything to money. O.M. Addressed removing the first. You either need a command economy or a post scarcity economy so there is no barter, or you start trading some type of I owe you which then becomes money. The second is also hard people naturally want to figure out relative values and there will be some metric. Number of hours spent in line getting it, how few are produced every year, how long the list of prerequisites is. And that metric will serve the place of money and if it is tradable it can become a currency. The one exception is a post sacristy society where every thing has the same value.
