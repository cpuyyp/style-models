My customer is running MS SQL Server 2000. I completed a project, but I failed to realize that MS SQL Server 2000 will not allow a select inside insert into values thus giving the error: 

According to this MongoDB tutorial which explains how to manually deploy MongoDB on EC2, one of the steps states that you should have: "Individual PIOPS EBS volumes for data (1000 IOPS), journal (250 IOPS), and log (100 IOPS)." Why do I need individual EBS volumes for journal, log, and data? Can I just combine these into one EBS volume? 

I have a table by name ItemProperties with 15 columns. Columns names are like Feature1, Feature2, Color, Length, Width, Height etc... It has 10K+ rows. I need counts from this table where any 3 columns are filled (Not Null). Can we do this through a query? 

No Matter how many number of fields available, this code will work fine. I have taken help of cha's UNION ALL Query and developed the code. The results will be stored in a new table created by name "Result". 

Is there a good ratio for drive sizes for MongoDB? For example if you have a 8Gig drive for the data, then how big should my drive for the log be? How about the drive for the journal? Just a little more background I'm following this tutorial, which states: According to this MongoDB tutorial which explains how to manually deploy MongoDB on EC2, one of the steps states that you should have: "Individual PIOPS EBS volumes for data (1000 IOPS), journal (250 IOPS), and log (100 IOPS)." 

But I am missing few items with my queries. Note: I have 6 million records with 300K GroupID's in my table. Please give an efficient query. 

I am here answering my own question. After so many observations and experiments with searching over the internet, I found solution to this issue. You need to run this simple query 

After several experiments I am here answering my same question. This works as our traditional method. Run queries one by one as below to understand the flow of task. Example1: Query 1: Below query returns . Meaning @a = 

I have a DB2 database and I'm using Control Center. I've found a procedure in the 'Stored Procedures' folder, which I need to modify. In MS SQL Server and Oracle you can accomplish this right from the DBMS. Is there a way I can modify this procedure with an editor in DB2 (9.7.0), similar to SQL Server and Oracle? 

According to this document from the MongoDB documentation, there are various data types in MongoDB, but again, How do I explicitly define data types for a MongoDB collection? 

You can see the information how SQL tables are linked. Keep the mouse pointer on the link table. You can see all the information like 

I have a database created in SQL Server 2008 R2. I have upgraded to SQL Server 2012. I was trying to execute below query to calculate percentile 

The setting takes effect immediately without restarting the server. Please refer Configure the remote query timeout Server Configuration Option and sp_configure. 

I have a CentOS (Linux) server and looked at the /bin directory, but don't find the applications listed below. What folders should I check to see if these applications are installed on my server? I'm reading a MongoDB book and it states: After you install or extract MongoDB successfully, you will have the applications show in table 2-1 available in the bin directory (in both Linux and windows). 

I need to identify and update co-related records under Co_Related_Item column as depicted below. Table name is CoRelated. Scenario explaination: In the first group i.e. [GroupID] = 1 we can see b=c, c=d and e=d, hence b=c=d=e and need to be flagged 'YES'. They are co-related. But x is not co-related to any item with in the group and hence it is a different item. So we can ignore this record. 

I'm calling this query from coldfusion10. I've already realized a solution utilizing coldFusion10 for this problem by replacing the select statement calling the query and storing the results in a coldFusion list variable, then iterate through a loop that inserts the contents of the CF list variable to its respective record, but this takes much more processing then a simple SQL statement. I've found solution like this: 

I received a MS Access form client. It is in access 2007 format. Initially Navigation Pane was not available. Only form was visible. Then I choose options->Current database->checked Display Navigation Pane check box. It is visible now. But It is suppressed and not able to resize or access it as shown in below screenshot. I checked the code by pressing Alt+F11. I could not find script related to navigation pane. Please advise. 

How do I explicitly define data types for a MongoDB collection? I understand that in Mongo if a collection doesn't exist it will create it when you insert the document, but I know the fields and data types of the collection before hand and I want to create it. I have created an example collection using: 

But I don't think coldFusion will allow this in a query (will try after the weekend) Is there a way to re-write not using Transact-SQL Variables?
