Edit. I have not realised that this question is on Birational automorphisms, and not on automorphisms, so what I wrote below does not really answer the question. But I will leave this for a background to the question. This answer concerns automorphisms of complex projective manifolds (and more generally Kahler ones). Statement. If $X$ is Kahler then $\mathbb Z[1/2]$ action on $X$ extends to an action of $\mathbb R$ on $X$ unless it factors through the action of a finite group (thanks to Yves). This follows immediately from Lieberman's-Fujiki theorem (thanks to YangMills for a refernece to Fujiki, see his comment), which I will state now (D. I. Lieberman. Compactness of the Chow scheme: applications to automorphisms and deformations of Kahler manifolds, 1978). Denote by $Aut_0(X)$ the connected component of identity map in the group of automorphisms of $X$. Lieberman-Fujiki Theorem. Consider the action of $Aut(X)$ on $H^*(X,\mathbb Z)$, $\phi: Aut(X)\to GL(H^*(X,\mathbb Z))$. Then the group $Aut_0(X)$ has finite index in $ker(\phi)$. Proof of the statement. Clearly if $\mathbb Z[1/2]$ belongs to $Aut(X)$, then a finite index subgroup of it belong to $ker(\phi)$ (indeed $GL(H^*(X,\mathbb Z))$ does not have infinitely $2$-divisible elements apart form $Id$). So by Lieberman-Fujiki theorem it belongs to $Aut_0(X)$. But $Aut_0(X)$ is a Lie group. This finishes the proof. I don't know if the same reasoning can work in the real case (one might first look closer into the proof of Liebermann's result). 

To complement the answers of Sasha and Damiano I would like to give one (completley non-generic) example of a very specific configuration when a quadric contains exactly $3\cdot 2^{n-2}$ points. Take in $\mathbb C^n$ the collection of $2^n$ points $(\pm 1,..., \pm 1)$. It is clear that this collection is the intersection of n quadrics. Indeed, we can obtain these points by taking intersection of $n$ degenerate quadrics $Q_i:=(x_i+1)(x_i-1)=0$, then we perturb a bit each quadric by adding a little multiple of $(\sum_i x_i^2-n)$. This way we get $n$ smooth quadrics that intersect transversally in the above $2^n$ points. Finally take one more singular quadric $(x_1-1)(x_2-1)=0$ it contains exactly $3\cdot 2^{n-2}$ points. 

Let $\bar M_g$ be the Deligne-Mumford compactifiction of the moduli space of complex genus $g$ curves $M_g$. Is this correct that through every point of the boundary $\bar M_g\setminus M_g$ passes a rational curve that lies in the boundary $\bar M_g\setminus M_g$? 

I would like to add one more piece of information and some pictures concerning the snake like tube. All this was communicated to me by Peter Panov. To analyze the movement of a ray in the tube we will study instead the movement of a ray in the billiard depicted below. To get the billiard from the tube one should cut from the tube a piece included between two vertical segments of length 1 passing through two neighboring "cusps" of the tube. The picture below shows one particular trajectory in the billiard. 

This question is a more than 100 years old problem and it is called in the litearture "Hurwitz exitence problem". This is an open problem. Though many partial cases are solved. For example you can check the following article On the existence of branched coverings between surfaces with prescribed branch data, I Ekaterina Pervova, Carlo Petronio $URL$ Of course, you can give an obvious formal answer, (in the first case that is not irreducible) that the cover exists if and only if the product of the elements in the group algebra of $S_n$ corresponding to the permutation that you chose contains $1$ in their decomposition. But this is just a reformulation of the problem. Here is a different example of a recent article on Hurwitz existence problem, it contains in partcular a lot of references on the research in this topic. Solution of the Hurwitz problem for Laurent polynomials $URL$ Also notice that there is a whole branch of math nowadays where people try to compute the actual number of ramified covers, and not only to answer the quesiton wheather a cover exists or not. Here is a typical example Gromov-Witten theory, Hurwitz theory, and completed cycles Authors: Andrei Okounkov, Rahul Pandharipande $URL$ 

The answer to this question can be formulated in the following way. All maps from $\Omega$ to $P$ are classified up to homotopy by the elements $\alpha\in H^1(\Omega,\mathbb Z_2)$, and maps from $\Omega$ to $P$ are classified by the elements $\beta\in H^1(\partial\Omega,\mathbb Z_2)$. Since we have the inclusion $i:\partial \Omega\to \Omega$ we get the map $i^*: H^1(\Omega,\mathbb Z_2)\to H^1(\partial\Omega,\mathbb Z_2)$. In order to be able to extend any map $\partial \Omega\to P$ to the map $\Omega\to P$ we just need to check that $i^*\alpha=\beta$. 

EDITED. Since the queston is modifyied a bit, here is the modified answer. Let us start with an example. Conisder the flat cone $C$ with cone angle $4\pi$. It can be seen as a double cover of flat $R^2$ with ramification at point $(0,0)$. Let $x$ and $y$ be two preimages of point $(1,0)$. Let us first show that on $C$ there is no smooth geodesic that joins $x$ and $y$ and does not contain $0$. Indeed if there were such a geodesic $\gamma$, its projection to $R^2$ would be a straight segment with bough ends at point $1,0$, so such a segment would have zero length, which is an obvious contradiction. On the contrary, we have the "broken geodesic" that joins first $x$ with $0$ and then $0$ with $y$, it has length 2. The moral of the story, is that if would be wrong to define the distance between two points as the lenght of the shortes SMOOTH geodesic. Such geodesic may not exist. We are dealing with a singular metric and so should admit that some geodesic should be "singular" too. The correct defintion of a geodesic in this case can be "shortest continuous path that joins two points". Notice that for a flat cone with angle $2\pi$ and more there is always a unique geodesic in this sense, because this is a space of non-positive curvature. Sometimes the geodesic is a "broken geodesic", sometimes just a smooth segment. And surelly this is a metric space, so triangle inequality holds. 

If you want some non-existence results, you might be interested in the work of Beauville who proves the following theorem: Theorem. A smooth complex projective hypersurface of dimension $\ge 2$ and degree $\ge 3$ admits no endomorphism of degree $> 1$. $URL$ Note, that this theorem holds as well for quadrics of dimensions $\ge 3$. You can easily conclude from this theorem that any hypersurface $X$ that is not Calabi-Yau (i.e. $X\subset \mathbb P^n$, $deg(X)\ne n+1$) don't have self-maps of positive entropy (of course, we impose $deg(X)\ge 2$, $X$ is not a quadric in $\mathbb CP^3$). On the other hand Calabi-Yau manifolds (in particular Tori) have self-maps of positive entropy quite often. This is especially well studied in dimension two (for K3 surfaces): $URL$ Apart from this, I would like to give a reference (that you probably know) on one preprint of Gromov on this topic, that you can find on his webpage: ON THE ENTROPY OF HOLOMORPHIC MAPS: $URL$ 

These two symplectic manifolds are canonically symplectomorphic. Notice first, that the map $\mu$ vanishes on the sub-bundle of $T^* M$ of 1-forms vanishing on the fibers of the fibration $M\to X$. Let us call this sub-bundle by $T_h ^* M$ (h- for horizontal). To construct the symplectomorphism notice that there is an obvious projection $\pi: T_h^* M \to T^* X$. The restriction of the symplectic form of $T^* M$ to $ T_h^* M$ equals to the pullback of the symplectic form of $T^* X$ under $\pi$. The projection $\pi$ commutes with the action of $G$ and $G$ preserves the symplectic form on $T^* M$. Since the projection $\pi$ just produces the quotient of $T_h^*M$ by the action of $G$, now everything follows from definitions. 

As far as I understand not all experts in birational geometry would agree that Siu settles in his preprint Abundance conjecture, and this conjecture is considered for the moment as open. When Kawamata mentions in his recent paper the work of Siu On the abundance theorem in the case $\nu=0$ $URL$ his says that in his work Siu using analytic methods reproved the abundance conjecture for a non-minimal algebraic variety whose numerical Kodaira dimension is equal to 0. I would guess Kawamata would not write his paper if it were accepted that Siu gives complete proof of abundance conjecture. So for the moment it should be conisdered that for $X$ of dimesnion $4$ and higher it is unknown if $H^0(nK_X)=0$ for all $n$ impies that $X$ is unirulled. As for analysis been stronger than algebra, there are examples when this is not quite the case. A famous one is bend and break, that uses characteristics $p$ and is a corner stone of minimal model program $URL$ The existence of minimal models is still unknown even for 3-dimensional Kahler manifolds that are not algebraic... 

As far as I know your question is completely open. At the present moment no one knows if for $n>2$ there is a symplectic structure on any manifold homotopic to $\mathbb CP^n$ but not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb CP^n$. In fact our knowledge in these type of questions equals to zero. Namely, the following is open: Question. Let $M^{2n}$ be any closed manifold ($n>2$) admitting an almost complex structure $J$ and a class $h\in H^2(M,\mathbb R)$ with $h^n\ne 0\in H^{2n}(M^{2n})$. Is it true that there is a symplectic form $w$ on $M^{2n}$ in the class $h$? Your question about $\mathbb CP^{n}$ is open as well for $n=2$. We don't know yet if there exist manifolds homeomorphic to $\mathbb CP^2$ but not diffeomorphic to it. The only thing that can be said is that if such a symplectic $4$-fold exists it would be of general type. But if I would bet, I would say that the answer to your question is no... 

Let me say first, that I really like this question. Very unusual question about such well known things (in fact I did not know even that the real quintic $\sum_i x_i^5=0$ is $\mathbb RP^3$). This is not an answer, but more like my interpretation of this question (hopefully correct one). The first comment is about vanishing cycles. Usually, when we speak about vanishing cycles in symplectic geometry, we speak about lagrangan spheres in a fiber of a Lefshetz fibraton constructed using parallel transport given by the symplectic connection on the fibers. But Lefshetz pencil is just the most simple object of algebraic geometry. We can consider instead other one-parameter families of algebraic varieties, that can have singularities more complicated than double points $A_1$. In this case again we can ask what will be the shape of the vanishing cycle constructed via symplectic parallel transport? How does it look like? The point that I want to make is that in a large case of situations, this vanishing cycle will not look at all like a manifold. Namely, we will consider the example coming from a function on $\mathbb C^n$ with isolated singularity. I.e., we have an analytic function $F:\mathbb C^n\to \mathbb C$ with isolated singularity at $0$ and consider its level sets: hyper-surfaces $F_t:=F^{-1}(t)$ intersected with $B_\varepsilon(0)$ (the ball of radius $\varepsilon$). Then we know that the homotopy type of $F_t\cap B_{\varepsilon}$ is a bucket of $k$ spheres, where $k$ is the Milnor number of the singularity. Now, I think (and here I can not provide the proof), that the vanishing cycle is a deformation retract of $F_t\cap B_{\varepsilon}$. Hence it can not be diffeomorphic to a manifold unless $k=1$. In this case it has to be homotopy equivalent to a sphere, i.e., homeomoerphic to it (by Poincare). In the case when the singularity of $F$ is non-degenerate (double point), the vanishing cycle is of course diffeomorphic to $S^n$, but maybe if we consider Brieskorn singularities we will be able to get vanishing cycles that are exotic spheres as well? The above situation concerns the case when the total space of the fibration is smooth. In this case we does not seem to be able to get $\mathbb RP^{n-1}$ as a vanishing cycle. But if we allow singularities in the total space of the fibration, we can get it. Indeed if we consider the function $\sum_i x_i^2=0$ on the total space $\mathbb C^n/\mathbb Z_2$, where $\mathbb Z_2$ is acting by $z\to -z$, the vanishing cycle will be diffomorphic to $\mathbb RP^{n-1}$. In sum, it seems to me that the following question is interesting: can we describe the class of manifolds what appear as vanishing cycles of algebraic one-parameter families? As for the question itself, I don't know what is the answer... 

Edited. For the definitions that you mention "Simplectic Fano" can be non-montone. For example, you can take a $4$-dimensional Kahler non-agebraic torus that does not have complex curves at all. Such a torus does not have complex curves at all and it is has no symplectic structure for which it is monotone. The same trick can be done with K3 surface 

Let $X$ be a complex manifold with quotient singularities, and let $\tilde X$ be its resolution (that exists, for example, by Hironaka). Then I am pretty sure that $\pi_1(X)\cong \pi_1(\tilde X)$. 

Proof. The idea of the proof is simple. We will cover $X$ by a collection of contractible neighbourhoods $U_i$, such that all their mutual intersections are also contractible. In this case the homothopy type of $X$ equals the homothopy type of the nerve of the covering. In particular, $\pi_1(X)$ equals the fundamental group of the nerve. In addition we will chose $U_i$ so that for each resolution of $X$ all preimages of $U_i$ together with their intersections are simply connected. Then again we can calculate $\pi_1(\hat X)$ as the fundamental group of the nerve (surely, this will not work for higher homothopy groups, since the preimages of $U_i$ will not be contractible any more). Choice of $U_i$. Since $X$ is an orbifold, each point $x\in X$ has a neighbourhood isomorphic to $\mathbb B^n/G_x$ where $\mathbb B^n$ is a unite complex ball in $\mathbb C^n$ and $G_x$ is the finite stabiliser of $x$ that is acting linearly on $\mathbb C^n$ (and hence on $\mathbb B^n$). Now we chose a finite cover of $X$ by such neighbourhoods. Now by the above lemma $U_i$ has a simply connected resolution. Hence each of its resolution is simply connected by the above proposition. End of proof.
