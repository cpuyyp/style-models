I've never heard that claim before. Where have you heard it? To me, that makes no sense. Interviews serve several purposes. 

Talk with the person who arranged last year's party and (as @ErnestFriedman-Hill points out) anyone who attended that party. Learn what worked well then, and what didn't. And take the "bowling" hint to heart. 

Well of course you can! You are simply choosing not to. It doesn't sound like the larger corporation, your new manager, and you are a good fit. That might be temporary, as often situations come up for new managers that require a bit of fire-fighting which hopefully won't continue in the long run. Or it might be an indicator of what is to come on a regular basis. Either way, it sounds like you have already concluded that your boss doesn't understand you, and isn't using your skills the way you want them to be used. You seem to have decided that you want to concentrate more on what you have been doing than on what your new manager wants you to do. 

Yes. Maybe not blatantly. Maybe not much. Maybe not consciously. But certainly anyone who is late for an interview starts off on the wrong foot. The interviewer must factor that into things. The fact that the interviewer went ahead with the interview anyway tells us that the mistake was most likely not fatal (I know several folks who wouldn't have continued with the interview if you were late at all.) Likely it won't matter that much. And if your interview went well, it may quickly be forgotten. Promptness is only one attribute of many against which you will be judged. And depending on the nature of the job, this may not be a significant attribute. As @DarkCygnus wrote "There is no second chance to give a first impression." Interviewees should try hard not to be late. Hopefully, this will be a good lesson for your future. Be more careful using Google Maps. Whenever possible, do a dry run to the interview site. Leave much earlier, so that you can arrive on time even in the face of obstacles. Basically, make it a priority to be there on time. For now, put your arrival in the past - you can't do anything about it now. If you get called for a second interview, arrive promptly and knock it out of the park. 

If this potential employer is as odd as this one sounds, I'm not sure you can decline without risking the job offer. I've never heard of a company asking someone to represent them at a trade show as a condition of employment. I think you are correct to be wary of that. What if you do a bad job - is the employer okay with having their company portrayed in a bad light at this show? Very odd. And I think you are correct that you cannot effectively be seen working for another company, while being employed at your current company. I would suggest that you talk with the hiring manager. Indicate that you are not comfortable representing a company you don't work for at a trade show. Then be prepared to deal with the consequences. It's possible that there is some confusion here, and that what you indicate isn't exactly what the hiring manager is asking for. It's possible that the hiring manager didn't think this one through, and will drop that as a condition of employment once you bring it to his attention. But it's also possible that this individual thinks it's okay to ask candidates to do this sort of unpaid work. You'll need to decide if this is a dealbreaker for you or not. (For me it would be, your mileage may vary.) 

Yes. This isn't uncommon. Small business owners often must make rapid changes, as their business fluctuates. And lots of overtime pay can be a significant strain on a 5-man business. Talk with your boss/owner. Explain how much you like the job, but that you were expecting more hours. Explain how this 20-hour cut puts you in a difficult situation. Then listen. If you sense that the job will be permanently reduced by 20 hours, and that it no longer fits your needs, then start looking for your next job. 

You talk with them. Preferably you meet with them and talk in person. If that's not viable, then you talk by phone. You ask enough questions until you get a sense of what they need you to do, and what kind of time and effort it might take to help them. You basically act like a consultant in the discovery stage. You may have to engage in a conversation. Even if you asked "what do you really want" non-technical folks won't know the answer. You have to learn what is bothering them. That starts with a discussion. Think of a doctor trying to diagnose and treat an illness. A doctor wouldn't ask "What do you really want?" A doctor would ask about the problems. If you cannot get that, then either they can't really express what they want, you aren't capable of delivering what they need, or both. It's possible that you might not have the skill for this job, if it requires this sort of diagnostic ability. And in that case you walk away and seek a different part-time job. 

Huge mistake! You must never sign anything (electronically or otherwise) without reading it - even the yada, yada documents. Don't repeat that one! 

You avoid this by letting your new boss worry about your assignments. If your old boss tries to co-opt your time, just make sure that approval goes through your new boss first. You may indeed be asked to help transition your previous work to someone new. As long as your new boss approves, you just do it. Don't be petty - that won't be good for you. 

It's very reasonable, if you approach the discussion cautiously. Ask them if they would be willing to give you some honest feedback as a way for you to understand what really happened and to try to prevent similar things from happening in the future. Ask in private and individually, rather than in a group setting. Be sensitive to their responses, both verbal and non-verbal. Remember that these people still work at your former company, so it's difficult for them to be completely objective while they are still in the middle of things. And be sensitive to the fact that people often don't feel comfortable being brutally honest - even if that is what you are asking for. If any of them hesitate to share their understanding, you may not have made them feel safe about such a conversation, and you may need to back off. Assure them that everything they tell you will be held in the strictest confidence, then follow through on that promise. Don't talk about one former colleague with another. Don't repeat what your colleague says about a former boss to another. If they are willing to share, remember that they can only provide one viewpoint, and that it is never the whole story. Never blame them for any part of your situation. And refrain from blaming anyone else or trying to get them to blame anyone else. Try to focus on you and only you. Never get angry at what they tell you, even if it hurts you personally and professionally. You have asked for feedback - accept it as helpful, constructive advice; even if it may include criticism of you. Thank them for being candid and for their help. Asking for this kind of feedback is a great way to learn, to understand, and to move on. 

Just be direct! Send a note to HR with something like "I'd like to propose plastic plates and cutlery for our kitchen, rather than ceramic and silver, and here's why..." Then explain in a bit more detail. Make your tone friendly and professional, don't call out individuals, and don't nag. While this may not trigger the desired change, it give you your best chance. When you want something done in a professional environment, contact the ones who can make it happen, state your case in a friendly manner, and hope for the best. 

First something like "I'm sorry. I haven't heard that Project B was ready for testing. I'll check into it and get right on it." Than, you might wish to use this as an opportunity to discuss the process with your boss. Indicate that this slipped through the cracks. Ask about the process in this shop regarding how you can know that a product is ready for testing. Perhaps there is a status board somewhere. Or perhaps you are supposed to look at the code checkin status daily. Perhaps there is a real QA Team with whom you should coordinate. Perhaps you aren't being invited to status meetings where testing readiness is discussed. Or something else. Or perhaps it's not really your issue at all, and the developers are supposed to tell you whenever something is ready for testing. In that case, indicate that you'll work with the developers in question to make sure they know and understand your role and have your email and phone number. You'll only know by asking. And if the process seems inefficient or ineffective, eventually you may wish to propose an alternative process.
