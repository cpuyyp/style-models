From my research, the Garmin Edge 800 uses a 1Ah lithium ion battery. In general, these do not have a memory effect like older rechargeable batteries. But some care is still worthwhile, for example storing the battery completely charged (in a hot environment) or completely discharged is damaging. Partial discharge cycles are generally seen as good for them. A full discharge and recharge every 30 uses is recommended by some sites. 

The next thing is training. Although you didn't ask here are my suggestions ... but firstly the good news ... hauling your body mass up a hill like Mont Ventoux means you have a serious level of strength and fitness. The key is to loose some of the mass while keeping the strength and endurance. From my observations for most males (it doesn't work the same for females) the best thing for weight loss is a 40 minute training ride before breakfast. To maintain strength, do hill repeats or efforts on gradients of 8 to 15% Find a steep and climb it once a month to track progress. Mix these rides with Long Slow Distance rides to maintain aerobic condition. Be careful not to overtrain; 3 rides per week is enough. I'm sure you don't need advice for the actual climbs, but for others who read this, such climbs should be started slowly, they get hard enough soon enough! Enjoy! 

By my calculations, if you pedaled at a cadence of 100 then you'd be doing 33 kph. But there's a different problem that you are not addressing: how much power does it take to do what you suggest? To do 33 kph takes about twice the power of 25 kph, because the amount of power required rises as the cube of the speed. To go at 40 kph takes more than three times the power that 25 kph does. So, in the end, my advice is learn to pedal faster. It costs nothing, and while you're doing it you will build up the muscular and aerobic capacity to get to those higher speeds. At some stage, an upgrade will be required, but you'll still have the money to do it. Happy cycling. 

You can extend the life of your bike by switching to a longer headstem if the bike starts feeling too small. You already felt that the smaller bike was better for you, and a couple of answers here support that view. It's important that you feel you've made a sound choice. It helps to have confidence in your equipment. But I recommend talking to the guy who recommends that smaller bike and asking questions such as 

All these factors are inter-related, but it all boils down to the fact that you are using a lever (via your pedals, gears, and wheels) to lift your weight X meters up the hill in less time than your competitors. Lower gears give you a longer lever. Lower weight means you don't have to push as hard. Your strength and aerobic capacity determine how fast you go and how long you can keep it up. Plus the X factor: in competition it's not the fittest, or strongest who win, because at a given level everyone has often pretty much the same physical capabilities. In this situation it's the most determined, the one who can stand the pain the longest, who wins. One family member became a national champion saying just one more tree, or just until that post, and the next. And the next. And smiling to psych the others out. So, to be competing, either with friends or in open competition, if it's comfortable, you are doing it wrong! If you think lower gears will help, then you are right. They will help; it will be a self-fulfilling prophesy. For a while. But in the end, you will need to address the central issues. Your strength. Your endurance. Your pain threshold. It can be a great journey. Enjoy. 

Since the guard is "beat up" it seems to have been doing it's job. So the derailleur is, or was, out of adjustment. Making sure the derailleur is properly adjusted is the first thing to do. The next thing is to ride the bike for some weeks to see if it stays adjusted. If the derailleur stays adjusted then you could remove the spoke guard rather than replace it. But if you have any doubts about it then keep it. If the derailleur gets caught in the spokes then it can be ruined, along with a bunch of spokes. Answering your direct question is difficult without a photo, because different tools are needed for different bikes. So take it to a shop for this. 

The last two are clearly just for variety. They have obvious dangers. There are other positions you can use for variety. 

In general, yes it is rude. But there can be times when it's acceptable. I'm sure we all understand that you are trying to maximize your own safety. It is a tricky balance to achieve. Especially since how you ride depends on the local driver and cyclist cultures, and local laws. In many places we cyclists struggle for respect and acceptance by the motoring majority. There are multiple overlapping factors / factions involved: 

By my calculations, at 25 kph you are pedaling at a cadence of 76 to 77 pedal strokes per minute. That's low. By far the cheapest option is to learn to pedal faster. Aim for at least 90, preferably 100 (or more) strokes per minute when you're flat out. Depending on whose opinion they follow, most road cyclists (ie people who ride road bikes fairly seriously) aim to cruise at 90 or 100. The big downside of what you're currently doing (it's called mashing) is that it can cause knee damage in the long term. The downsides to aiming for a higher cadence are 

It would help if you mentioned what unsuccessful searches you've done so that others don't have to repeat those steps. I didn't find much for 17 inch solid tires. Google shows results for 16 inch solid tires and 18 inch solid tires. If those don't help, then one solution is to make your own. I have not done this, but there are resources out there that may get you started 

I suggest undoing the bolts that hold the rubber piece in place. Obtain an old car tire, and with heavy shears, cut a couple of pieces the same size and shape. The idea is to put them back to back to make up the width. You'll need to make holes on each end for the bolts. A large drill could be used for this; I suggest a drill press, rather than a hand-held drill, for safety reasons (the drill bit may bind in the rubber). You may need to have a few tries to get it all to work right. Good luck :-) 

The main thing is that the child feels comfortable and confident that they have control. At the start most kids want to be able to sit with their feet flat on the ground and their knees bent slightly. Others may be happy with their knees straight, but it's better to start too low than too high. It's all about developing their confidence. As they gain confidence and want to go faster they will need the seat to go little higher. Of course they also need it to be raised as they grow. I recommend adjusting the seat by very small amounts, about 1 mm, at a time. Do it while the child is asleep, so that it does not become an issue. 

To quote David Richerby: You're over-thinking this. Most people close their bottles most of the time. I'm not one to worry about a little "gunk", but I close my bottle more than half the time. I almost never wipe it (heh, I almost never wash it :-) Not fanatical about it though. If I'm taking a quick swig before a corner then I'll just jamb the bottle back, whether the top's open or closed, before I get to the corner. That can happen a lot, because I drink a little, often. 

The answer to both parts of you question is yes. Climbing is easier with a lighter bike, and easier with lower gearing. But several factors that you don't mention interact to determine which bike is better for you. These are your weight, how steep the hills you'll be climbing are, how strong you are, how hard you want to work, and how the bike fits you. And maybe I've left some factors out. Firstly, consider some simplified physics. You use the cranks, chain rings, rear gears, and rear wheel to essentially lever your weight and that of the bike up the hill. If you weigh, say 150 lb (68 kg), and carry 2 lb of water (about 1 kg), the total for the first bike is 175.2 lbs (79.6 kg) and for the other bike it's 172.7 lbs (78.5 kg). Now we use those levers. Since everything else about the bikes is same, we only need consider the lowest gears - 32 on the first bike, 28 on the second. For the first bike, divide 172.7 by 32 gives us 5.4 (lbs per tooth, for those who like units). For the second bike, divide 175.2 by 28 gives us 6.3 (lbs per tooth). Main Conclusion So we see that the gearing dominates the result. The bike with the lower gearing will feel about 15% easier when climbing a hard hill, even though it's the heavier bike. Other factors The next question is: will you actually use this lower gear? What happens when climbing a hill is that your strength (how hard you can push the pedals) multiplied by your cadence determines the power you produce. It's your power output that gets you up the hill, and since your strength is limited it's your cadence that determines your power output. Assuming we have a maximum steady power output, then as the hill gets steeper, our cadence (and road speed) drops. We change to a lower gear at that point, until we run out of gears. Until this point we have been able to produce our maximal power, but now that the hill is steeper we don't have enough strength to keep turning the pedals that fast. So our cadence, road speed, and power output drops away. So if you're strong enough and the hills you climb are not too steep, then you will not need that lowest gear. That's why the Pros don't have granny gears - they are strong for their body weight. But for most of us, that lowest gear will always get some use. Is it worth putting lower gears on the lighter bike? Firstly, will they fit, or will it be extra expense? If the lighter bike costs the same (unlikely) and the lower gears fit, then go for it. Finally, which bike fits you best? There is absolutely no point in getting a bike that does not fit you properly. A poorly fitting bike can quickly lead to pain and injuries. 

If your brake hoods are positioned correctly, you should be able to commute sitting up with your hands on the hoods, and brake from there. Braking is certainly not as strong from this position, but it's effective enough, and is quicker than getting into the drops to brake. The problem with a flat bar for commuting, compared to a road bike with drop bars, is that the flat bar is wider. So when you say slaloming between cars, I think you'll be restricted by the extra width. I have commuted with drop bars this way for 30 years in heavy traffic, and never had a problem with being able to brake hard enough. And that's using traditional cable actuated rim brakes. If you have not been used to braking from the hoods then it will feel strange at first. Practice, and maybe build up some hand strength in the process. And ride with a little more caution until you gain confidence in your ability to stop. At best, you'll have developed a new skill and saved your money. At worst, you can switch to a flat bar later (with a different bike, because the geometry will be wrong on this one). Finally, it could be that your brake hoods are positioned too low. They should be set up so that braking is possible from the drops and the hoods. 

Change gears before you need to You can do this two ways. Change to a higher gear before you stop. Get out of the saddle when you start. You'll accelerate faster and shouldn't need to change gears until your doing 30 kph (20 mph) or so. Or change gears regularly as you start, say every 3 or 4 pedal strokes. 1, 2, 3, change. 1, 2, 3, change. 

The highest speeds on bike similar to road bikes is the 200m track sprint, where the record is 9.347 seconds, for an average of 77kph. 

Don't expect or force yourself to ride beyond your skills and new found level of respect. And don't let anyone pressure you either. The key is confidence. Not over confidence. Without confidence, like me skiing a steep slope, you are certain to crash. But with well-founded confidence in our skills we can do much better. 

The point I'm trying trying to make in each of these is that rehabilitation is a partnership. Each therapist has their strengths, weaknesses, interests and focus. To get to your goal, you need someone whose goals match yours. More importantly, someone who admits where their knowledge or experience ends. And a willingness to call in others who may have the necessary knowledge or skills to help you. So you'll have be open about your goals, and openly search for a therapist who you can really relate to. Communication is key Oh, and one more thing. Indoor training has come a long way. Check out BKOOL and Zwift. 

There are multiple causes of back pain; it's the most common human ailment, and the solution is unlikely to be simply given in an Internet forum answer. Just because you've ridden the same bike for years does not mean it fits you. For example a slightly incorrect fit could be causing the problem. And your body can change over time; perhaps you've gained some weight, or lost some flexibly. So what used to fit may not fit now. So I would definitely recommend a professional bike fitting. Another cause of back pain is low core strength. Do look into this one. The third thing to consider is gearing. Perhaps you're trying to pedal too hard, especially before you're thoroughly warmed up. Perhaps you're trying to be too quick on those short rides. This is easily overcome by using a higher cadence, or to look at it another way, use a lower gear. Get a sports medicine person involved, such as a physiotherapist. Some of them can do the bike fit as well as diagnose causes and treat symptoms.
