The NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award was first awarded for the 1982–83 NBA season, whereas the NBA Most Improved Player Award was first awarded following the 1985–86 season. Since the 1982-83 season, 19 different players have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, which are listed below. 

Such a match did take place, but a few of the facts as stated in the question are incorrect. The visitors were Dynamo Moscow and not Spartak as claimed in the question. And the year was 1945, after the Second World War when football was suspended. British magazine FourFourTwo have an article on the games Dynamo played in Britain, which confirms the occurrence of this match. The section on Arsenal's website covering the years 1941-45 also mentions the occurrence of this match. Many claims in the question are false or exaggerated, but here are some of the facts from the game: 

Going by this definition, any player can legally receive the hand-off. However, if the wide receivers, center, guards or tackles fall back to receive a hand-off, it would leave the quarterback susceptible to an attack. Therefore, it is usually the running back who receives the hand-off and makes the offensive play. Oftentimes, the running back is an agile player who can successfully execute an offensive play from a hand-off. 

You are outlining the scenario where the batsman edges the ball before it hits the stump, so the decision would still be that the batsman is bowled out. In the modern game, umpires sometimes spend a few seconds after a bowled decision to verify that the delivery was not a no ball. Perhaps this is the confirmation that the umpire is seeking, which you seem to have confused with something else. 

In tests, a team can enforce follow-on if they must have a minimum lead of 200 runs after the second innings. However, often the leading team will decide not to enforce follow-on and go on to bat in the third innings, with weather forecasts, condition of the pitch, number of overs bowled in the second innings and bowlers' and fielders' fitness being important factors swaying the decision. What is the percentage of matches where the leading team chose not to enforce follow-on? I am focused on international cricket, but domestic records can also be included. 

When a hand-off takes place, the ball is not advanced towards the opponent goal line, so any player who reaches the quarterback would be eligible to take a hand-off. 

There seems to be no rule against hitting an opponent and many players have included body shots in their repertoire. (This assertion is validated by the fact that players like the Bryan brothers and Ivan Lendl are patrons of this strategy and there appears to be no record of any punitive action against them for using it.) If you are looking for more examples of players who used this strategy to win points, you can find a lot of examples in this 2013 article from Sports Illustrated. 

According to Law 27 of cricket, a batsman cannot be adjudged out unless there is an appeal for the wicket by the fielding team. 

So it looks like an own goal is worth two points only, irrespective of the location from where the ball was released. PS: NCAA uses the term 'opponent's basket' while FIBA uses the term 'his team's basket'. This is down to the definition of own and opponent's basket which is contradictory for both. For FIBA, refer Rule 1 Article 1.2 and for NCAA, refer Rule 1 Section 1 Article 2. 

The crucial criterion is whether the ball was going to make contact with the table or not before your opponent volleyed it. In your case, it seems it was not going to make contact with the table, so the point is awarded to your opponent even if he volleys the ball on or off the table. 

There is a method a group of friends and I used to follow when playing table tennis at school. Due to the availability of only 2 tables and too many players, we had to play doubles all the time. So we devised a ranking method to keep track of the best players and learn if our individual game improved or lagged behind the rest of the group. Whenever we got together to play, we paired up with someone. We played a game and the winners each got 1 point, while the losers got 0. For the next game, every player had to necessarily change his partner and pair up with someone new. No one could again pair up with someone they have already played with until they have paired up with everyone else. Each individual player kept a record of number of points and total number of games played that day, which was then added to a common book we maintained. At the end of every week, we would draw up the latest rankings, based on percentage of wins (number of points divided by total number of games played). This way, we could see weekly rankings and cumulative rankings at the end of every week. Players who improved were higher in the weekly rankings and slowly climbed up the cumulative rankings too. This system has one major requirement though, that the pairings should be truly random, or a system of rotation is enforced. If this is not followed, the rankings could be skewed if an average player frequently pairs up with their best buddy, who is a very strong player, and achieves a much higher rank than their ability would merit. In an enforced rotation system, the ranks would stabilize within a few weeks, whereas in a truly random system, the stabilization would take a little longer to reflect a true picture. 

The line which you have highlighted in the image is the wide marking. They provide the limits within which bowlers have to bowl and assist umpires in adjudging if a delivery can be called "wide". Sources: 1) $URL$ 2) $URL$ 

None of the above players have won the NBA Most Improved Player Award or the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, the lists of which are available at the Wikipedia links provided above. To answer the second part of your question, James Harden won the Sixth Man award for the 2011-12 season and in the 2014-15 season, came second in the MVP award voting, losing to Stephen Curry by 262 points(Curry 1198, Harden 936). Here is the official release from NBA for the voting results for the season. I have not combed the data for past years much, but second place seems as close as one can get to the MVP award. 

In cricket, I have often seen that incoming batsmen come in and mark the off-stump line with assistance from the non-striker. This is done by holding the bat in line with the stump till aligned, then scratching a line in the pitch with their shoes. It makes sense when done by openers, but I have often seen batsmen coming in at number 7 or 8 and performing this ritual before facing the first ball on that end of the pitch. Why do incoming batsmen mark their line even if they come in lower down the order? Shouldn't the line marked by the previous batsmen be enough? 

The Umpire Decision Review System (or DRS) is designed so that teams can review decisions that they feel the umpire may have got wrong. However, there is a catch, in that the team that asks for a review loses the review if the umpire decision stands. In a test match, each team gets 2 reviews per innings for the first 80 overs, and should they exhaust one or both of them, their quota of 2 reviews is replenished. By providing a limited number of reviews, which are lost when unsuccessful, the teams are forced to judiciously use their reviews. Suppose a player had a way to know every single time if an umpire's decision is correct or not, would that not be unfair to the other team? Unlike the players on the field, the players and support staff in the dressing room have access to TV replays, which often show Hawk Eye predictions for leg-before dismissals. A batsman can be given a signal from the dressing room, where TV replays are easily available, on whether he should review his decision or not and this would make it easier for the batting team to get the review correct each time. This way, the risk associated with the use of reviews is lost and players can always look to the dressing room to review successfully each time. 

It is a common sight in football that when a referee calls a foul and shows a card to an offending player, that player as well as other players from the offender's team surround and argue with the referee. What is the motive behind the exchange with the referee? The three questions I have are 

Returning the ball before it makes contact with the surface is called volleying in table tennis. I found this article on volleying which does a great job of explaining the rule for points awarded for a volley. The exact rule regarding volleys has been mentioned in the article but I have decided to add an excerpt of the explanation of the rule here, which is much easier to comprehend. 

Comparing that with the list of Olympic medalists in basketball shows only one of those eight players has won an Olympic medal (any Olympic medal), i.e Klay Thompson who won Olympic gold in Rio in 2016. So to answer your question, there are no father-son duos who are both NBA champions and Olympic gold medalists. Interestingly, had you posed this question four months earlier, there would have been no one from a father-son NBA champion duo to have claimed an Olympic medal. 

The team picked up 3 wickets, although Clint McKay was only credited with the one in the middle. Here is a video of the three wickets taken in three successive balls. 

Disclaimer: Wikipedia lists cannot be considered the ultimate reference, although my limited research has shown no discrepancy in case of this record. This Wikipedia list covers the second generation basketball players in the NBA, and mentions four father-son duos to have won the NBA Championship (in that order). 

You understanding of this rule seems to be right, except for one minor detail. Here is the rule in question, in its entirety (emphasis mine) 

If the ball breaks mid-air as you suggest, the play will be stopped and the ball will be replaced where the ball was broken. Even in case of penalties, the penalty is retaken if the ball bursts before making contact with any player or any part of the goal. To answer your query regarding the integrity of the ball, Law 2 Section 1 covers the parameters to define a ball: 

There are several articles that outline the benefits of taping a hockey stick. Check out this article and this one from livestrong.com. I am posting below some excerpts from the former article to cover the benefits of taping a hockey stick. 

In the page component that shows these numbers, there are navigational buttons that let you navigate from one tournament to the next. I hope that clears your confusion. 

Such an incident of a team hat-trick happened in the final of the 2016 Big Bash League. Melbourne Stars who were batting first, lost 3 wickets in the last 3 balls of the innings. Here is the match report of the final. 

However, one risks losing the respect of fans and opponents on using this strategy often. In my opinion, opponents with good reflexes can sometimes return the shot thus making it a not so viable strategy in the long run, but the above examples show that it is a strategy that is used to some extent.
