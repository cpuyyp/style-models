A simple huge loss of population If 95% of the population is gone and the rest is scattered around the world and can't get along (raiders, different factions,...), I doubt the world will progress much, especially if past technology is hard to recover and resources are scarce. Concerning the potential causes of such events, a virus is a good candidate. It can kill a lot of people and have a huge effect of area denial (quarantined areas) that can prevent people from accessing fertile lands for crops, lakes and rivers for water or any kind of resource. This virus could potentially affect plants and kill a lot of common crops. This would keep the struggle for survival constant and a lot of rivalries would occur, especially around viable land. 

You could do it with one hand on the blade and the other on the hilt (aka Half-swording), but doing with with both hands on the blade would not work. You would not have enough grip to hold the blade firmly and it would just slip off your hands. That's why cross-guards were made, so you can have a point of contact when you thrust. That part gives superior grip and prevents the hand from slipping on the blade. Even if you had a good grip, the damage would be superficial, you would only "scratch" your opponent, no serious injury. In fact, you might hurt yourself more than you hurt your opponent if you lack hand protection. 

This line is the real problem. The humans can never keep a secret from the computer. They can't have passwords or cryptographic keys. They can't even discuss means of encryption without the AI finding out about them. All current cryptography works by assuming that some information can be kept secret from an attacker. It might be the details of how the algorithm works, or a very large prime number, or a one-time pad, or a seed for a pseudo-random number generator. But there has to be a secret of some sort, so that a person with the secret can open the message, and a person without the secret can't. So, what's a secret that the AI wouldn't know? Try something video surveillance can't pick up on. This will depend on what technology the humans have available, but for the sake of argument I'm assuming they have advanced (though not AI-level) equipment. Suppose they each take a hair from one particular person, and encrypt it with this algorithm: sequence three particular genes from that sample, interpret the nucleotide sequence as a base-4 number, convert to binary, and XOR with your message. The AI might know that you're doing this, and the exact details of the algorithm. But video surveillance can't see someone's genes. (Keeping the message secret once it's decrypted is a different matter.) 

The Latin root for "moon" would be lun(a)- (lunars, lunites). The Greek root would be selen(e)- (selenites, selenians, selenes). The Sanskrit would be chandr(a)- (chandrans?). Or, pick a language spoken where these people were first discovered, and build off the word for "moon" in that language. 

If possible, I want this armor to be effective against bullets, but much less against melee weapons and heavier projectiles like bolts, arrows or darts of any sort. My hypothesis would be that scientists have a created a non-newtonian fluid or jelly, that "hardens" very well at the energy spectrum of typical bullets. However, it does not "harden" enough for lower energies (melee weapons, arrows, bolts,...) or extremely high energies (railguns, coilguns,..). Keep in mind, this is the future (we are talking centuries ahead, possibly millennia). Therefore, these melee weapons can be far from primitive (rocket hammers, chainsaw blades,...) but we are focussing on mechanical melee weapons here. There are such weapons like light sabres (based either on plasma or laser technologies). I have created this separate question in response to this one because conversations tended to go towards the feasibility of the armor instead of towards the main subject. This question is NOT about the feasibility of using melee weapons over ranged, please refer to the linked question for that. 

You have fungi species called cordyceps that parasite insects and change their behaviour drastically. For the case of ants, once the fungus finds its way into an ant, the ant will tend to leave the colony and find a nice place for the fungus to grow (if possible above an ant colony to help the spread of the fungus). There is also toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that makes the host attracted to felines. For example, mice infected by this parasite will not fear cats and will be somehow attracted to them until the cat basically kills and eats them. This is due to the fact the this parasite only multiplies once in a felid's body. By the way, this parasite is transmitted from the mother to the foetus. Both of these parasites alter the host's behaviour in a somewhat drastic way. I'd suggest you invent a reason for the parasite to make the host violent, some way that would benefit the parasite. 

It's possible, with some changes to history. The biggest obstacle in making a compound bow is the cam system. Simply put, there are a lot of things that can go wrong with it. It took until 2005 for someone to design a twin-cam system that wouldn't need frequent tuning, for instance. There was nothing in this design which couldn't have been invented by Leonardo da Vinci; there just wasn't much of any experimentation with pulley-based bow systems until the 20th century. However, in a world where clockwork was used significantly earlier, leading to the development of more mechanical weapons, it's not inconceivable that the idea could have arisen around the Renaissance. (Consider the Antikythera mechanism: a clockwork device with differential gears, from the second or third century BC. If that sort of technology had been more widespread, clockwork might have become prominent significantly before Renaissance times.) Without the cam system, there's not really a point in having detachable limbs. The strength of a non-compound bow comes from the bow itself acting as a spring; finding a way to make the limbs detachable, while keeping the entire bow sufficiently springy and not breaking under stress, is not trivial. If your dwarves are able to work aluminum, which is a notoriously difficult metal, the materials themselves are less of an issue. You may not be able to make wood as strong and light as fiberglass, but it can certainly be stronger and stiffer than is conventional for a longbow. Or even hollow metal components might be used as a substitute. 

Their body would require tremendous force to move through sand relatively quickly and it should be able to withstand the pressure of all that mass of sand above them. Other than that, I do not doubt on the ability of their scales to resist sand "grind" while moving. By the way, some reptiles already have a second eyelid. I think they would move more easily if they dug with their frontal claws rather than "swimming". 

In a futuristic setting, nations have invented a way to create armor just a bit heavier than cloth. This would be worn like chainmail and would be available widely. I am looking for a way to make this somewhat realistic and avoid deus ex machina as much as possible. 

First, to reload a decently powerful crossbow, you need a stirrup to have enough strength. It might not be practical to attach a bayonet. Second, a bayonet is basically a dagger, and daggers do not do well against things like plate armor. Daggers only do well against armor in very close combat or to finish off someone by stabbing armor weakpoints or by having specialised daggers like Rondel daggers to stab through mail or other soft armor more easily. By attaching a dagger to a crossbow, you lose the agility and manoeuvrability a dagger has. Third, why attach a dagger to your crossbow if you can have a more handy backup sword? It's like attaching and underslung 9mm single shooter under a rifle when you can have a semi-auto pistol as backup. Fourth, it makes you crossbow more unwieldy. You have more weight on the front so less stable shot, your weapon is longer which might be a bad thing in close quarters, in corridors or tight spaces. Fifth, there are usually melee units to "take the aggro" for you as a crossbowman. Therefore, it is very rare when you have to use melee yourself, making the bayonet kind of a gimmick. Sixth, unlike with a backup sword, you can hardly parry any attack. You can still somehow block with your crossbow, but it would likely be damaged or unusable after a while. Seventh, you lack any reach to be intimidating. Muskets and rifles are pretty long (especially muskets). This makes them usable as spears, albeit kind of short ones, but they are still somewhat viable to keep an enemy at a certain distance. A crossbow being pretty short, you just cannot have enough reach to be intimidating. I think you would barely have the reach of a longsword, but without the agility or the parrying abilities. Eighth, your opponent can easily break your "guard". Many medieval techniques strike the opponent's weapon to set it aside, breaking the opponent's guard, and then strike at the now vulnerable opponent. Due to the nature of the crossbow, and opponent can do this both horizontally (as you would do against other weapons) and vertically (by striking on the bow itself and potentially disarming you or breaking your weapon). 

It might never happen again. The problem with starting from scratch is, we've already used up all the easy-to-get resources. The Bronze Age and later the Iron Age started because early humans found those metals effectively lying out in the open. That's not going to happen again: all the deposits that close to the surface have been emptied, and the deeper ones require more technology to get access to. Now, the fact that some implements of modern life stick around does help things. No need to make a crude bronze axe when you have a nice steel one sitting in the shed. But those won't last forever, and getting coal out of the ground with no mechanical assistance whatsoever is a much more difficult task now than it was during the first Industrial Revolution. This doesn't mean that nothing can be accomplished: agriculture, for example, is entirely feasible (…as long as you're feeding a very reduced population), and wouldn't need to develop from scratch. I'm assuming all our domesticated and carefully cultivated crops would be untouched, since they're living organisms. But I doubt they'd ever reach the level of computers and internet. 

Human evolution didn't start at the Big Bang: there was a very long period before the first stars were formed, and then two generations of stars were born and died before our Sun. After our Sun formed, it was even longer before the planets were created, and then for the Earth to cool down and become habitable. At that point, life itself had to form, and only then did the actual evolution happen. Alien life probably couldn't have started before the third generation of stars, because of a lack of metals ("metals" in the astronomical sense meaning "anything that's not hydrogen"). But their planet could have become habitable much earlier, and the random processes that created life and then created intelligent life might have happened far faster through pure chance. All in all, it's been estimated that an alien civilization could be approximately a billion years ahead of us without any unknown chemical elements. EDIT: To respond to your updated question, evolution doesn't have much to do with technology once you reach a certain level of intelligence. Genetically, modern humans aren't much different from the ancient Egyptians six thousand years ago. But in that time we've gone from the bare beginnings of agriculture to space travel. As soon as humans evolved a way to communicate abstract ideas, cultural evolution outpaced biology. 

Assuming you could combine these elemental shards to make more complex machines, you could create railguns. You use air shards for electricity to power up your railgun and earth shards for projectiles like tungsten with ferromagnetic rings. Because of the high velocity of their projectiles, you can hit any kind of vehicle (planes, boats or land vehicles) from really far away. The main problems for a railgun are rate of fire and energy consumption. You could make smaller railguns with permanent magnets instead of charged rails to remove the need of air shards and potentially increase the rate of fire. This would however reduce power and range, which would complement the bigger railguns. You could also use lasers which would only use air shards (for gas and electricity). They would have very good range but would require a lot of power and continuous exposure. They could potentially be deflected easily as well though. You could use shards themselves as land mines and for area denial, but winds might not be in your favour and push the toxic fumes towards the city you're trying to protect. Speaking of which, you could create elemental mines using different shards. For basic guns, this would probably use air and earth shards (propellant and projectile) A big problem with all of these weapons is damage done to them as damaged shards would kill or seriously injure the user and people around it. 

Freezing a dying person can definitely help: as the saying goes, "they're not dead until they're warm and dead". The problem is that this causes serious tissue damage (in the present at least). If you just throw Bob into a vat of liquid nitrogen, water will freeze inside his cells and cause them to lyse. So you'll have to be a bit more careful. If he's frozen slowly, the water will leave the cells through osmosis as the ice forms, so you won't have that problem. However, this means you end up with a lot of ice in the space between cells. As this ice expands it will push the cells apart and cause damage to the structure of the tissue, and when the cells thaw they will have lost a lot of water. Also, most chemicals dissolved in the water will not be incorporated into the ice, so the concentration will increase as the amount of liquid water goes down. Not optimal. A small number of animals can survive freezing by replacing some of the water in their body with cryoprotectant (antifreeze) chemicals: waterbears use trehalose, wood frogs use urea and glucose. If you fill Bob's body with cryoprotectants the water will vitrify instead of freezing as it gets colder, avoiding most of these problems. The difficulty now is that most cryoprotectants either don't go through cell membranes, or are toxic in high concentrations. New cryoprotectants are always being developed, so it's not much of a stretch to assume we've found something less toxic by the time we're fighting full-on space battles. Bob's comrades could fill his bloodstream with our fictional new preservative, then freeze him very quickly in a tank of liquid nitrogen. The water in his body would go into a glassy state (hopefully) without causing further damage. Then when they got back to the hospital he could be revived and treated for his injuries. This probably wouldn't be very pleasant for Bob, since it would effectively kill him for a time, but at least he would get better in the end. 

First, you would have to engineer a Ophiocordyceps species that is interested in human targets, which may be a challenge as human are significantly bigger and might be harder to infect, or at least maintain the infection. The parasite would have to be able to either neutralize the host's immune system or avoid it. However, since humans are much bigger animals, the fungus would probably have access to much more nutrients and therefore produce much more spores (or at least you could engineer it to do so). To infect more humans, you could "teach" the fungus to lead the host to ventilation systems but it might be a bit cold and dry for the fungus to grow. Doing so would allow the infection to spread into a whole building. It needs to be able to find a "comfortable" place to grow from which it can spread its spores. From what I know, it needs to be a shady, humid and warm place. As for the mind control, I do not have sufficient knowledge to know in details how the fungus controls the host. Maybe it could act on synapses to modify brain signals. I am not sure if the fungus would benefit from an aggressive host. Judging by the original fungus' behaviour, it kills the host once it wants to spread its spores. Maybe it is because it needs as much energy as possible to create spore. If so, maybe the fungus would only need to consume part of its host to start producing spores and aggressiveness would allow the host to get closer to non-infected humans and ensure the spread of spores directly on non-infected individuals.
