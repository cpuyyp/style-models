There is really on two kinds... The Nature of Economics It is well-known that Austrians disagree strongly with other schools of economic thought, such as the Keynesians, the Monetarists, the Public Choicers, Historicists, Institutionalists, and Marxists… The ultimate difference from which all disagreements at the levels of economic theory and economic policy stem… concerns the answer to the very first question that any economist must raise: What is the subject matter of economics, and what kind of propositions are economic theorems? Mises’s answer is that economics is the science of human action… It is this assessment of economics as an a priori science, a science whose propositions can be given a rigorous logical justification, which distinguishes Austrians, or more precisely Misesians, from all other current economic schools. All the others conceive of economics as an empirical science, as a science like physics, which develops hypotheses that require continual empirical testing. The views of Mises’s predecessors, Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, and Wieser, are the same: They, too, describe economics as a discipline whose propositions can in contrast to those of the natural sciences be given some ultimate justification. But Mises by no means merely notices this rather obvious difference between economics and the empirical sciences. He makes us understand the nature of this difference and explains how and why a unique discipline like economics, which teaches something about reality without requiring observations, can possibly exist. It is this achievement of Mises’s which can hardly be overrated. — Hans Hermann-Hoppe, ESAM. Now why is this school of thought (what used to be indistinguishable from the orthodox) no longer so mainstream? Why Academics Hate A priori University instruction in an a priori science presents special problems if we are to adhere to the principle that an instructor ought to be a researcher as well. In every field there are very few who can make actual contributions to its intellectual treasury. In the a posteriori sciences, however, pioneers and followers work together with the same told, and there exists no outward distinction between them. In his laboratory, every professor of chemistry can compare himself with the great pioneer. Although his contribution may be modest, his research methods are the same. Things are different in philosophy, in economics, and in a certain sense, in mathematics. If academic positions were contingent upon independent contributions to economics, barely a dozen professors could be found throughout the world. If positions are awarded only to those researchers who had made original contributions, care must be taken to take into account research done in related areas. In effect, this makes the appointment to academic positions dependent upon scholarly activity in other areas: the history of ideas and doctrine, history of economics, and especially the economic history of the most recent past, which is often erroneously labeled economic problems of the present. The fiction perpetrated in scholarly circles that all professors are equal does not permit professors of economics to be divided into two classes: those who work independently as theorists, and those whose work consists of economic history and description. The inferiority complex of these “empiricists” has led to a campaign against theory. — Ludwig von Mises, Memoirs 

Your idea was proposed more than 100 years ago by Silvio Gesell ($URL$ He wanted to create a National Currency Office, in charge of money. No private banks. Money would be created in accordance with amount of wealth available. It would also depreciate, to make people spend it. Read his book "Natural Economic Order". It is online. You might be interested also in Social Credit ($URL$ I am reading about this at the moment. Very interesting. 

The "common man" conception of money is not helpful to think about these issues. Money is not ONLY currency and notes anymore. These are just a TOKEN used to distribute goods and provide exchanges. They are not the real stuff. For example, when you make a bank account transfer, you are not moving TOKENS. Why would you? Banks are given these tokens by the central bank in order to keep a smooth movement of payments. So Apple does not have 80% of all tokens of the US economy in a vault somewhere. Why would they? It's dangerous! They have such ownership of wealth, but in the form of a current account and other assets. So you need to think differently between a claim on wealth, WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO TOKENS, and the TOKENS THEMSELVES. 

In a world where one unit of X good is sold, it would go to the highest bidder. The second unit would go to the second highest bidder and would cost more to produce (marginally) than the last unit. If you carry this logic forward, at some point the next unit's marginal benefit (to the consumer) will be equal to the marginal cost (to the producer)**. The last consumer flipped a coin when purchasing since she got the same profit from purchasing and not purchasing. Similarly, the producer also was indifferent between producing and not producing the last unit. What if we supply ONE MORE unit than the equilibrium price? It would mean that the marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit. The world and the individuals transacting are worse off after this transaction because the costs exceeded the benefit. This is known as dead weight loss. Marginal benefit: 

You could represent the game in simultaneous form (matrix) to see all possible equilibria. If there is only one, then that's your subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (since there are no other equilibria). If there are multiple equilibrias in the simultaneous representation, the extensive form allows you to see if some paths would never be reached given the structure of the game. Essentially, the extensive form "proves" which paths would never be reached through ruling them out. The one path that is reached is your SPNE. An SPNE has a more strict definition. There is really no shortcut around the arithmetic in the extensive form since the definition of SPNE forces you to check for the one viable path. 

Page 75 of document: $URL$ I see, as Alecos suggested, that debt includes both loans and bonds. Itwas my mistake to assume debt is only bonds. 

Thank you Brian for the suggestion, and the others too. It took me a long time to find it in the Coca-Cola report, and it was under Current Liabilities: 

Risk is important. A bond (or even a credit) is backed up by the company's assets. Companies go bankrupt because of a mismatch between assets and liabilities maturities (e.g. cannot pay a bond of a loan), but not because they are unsustainable in the long run. If a company goes bankrupt, debtholders are the first on the list (after workers, in some countries) to receive compensation. Sometimes they do assume losses, when the debt is negotiated at a lower value. The shareholder is the last one to get any money out of the assets of the company. So being a shareholder is more risky than being a bondholder. 

But debt is bonds, accounts payable refer to money owed to suppliers ($URL$ Is it under "Other Current Liabilities"?. How can I know? Anyone has experience looking at balance sheets? I'm learning this. 

I am looking at the balance sheet of Coca-Cola ($URL$ but I cannot guess where loans with banks are. These liabilities accounts are:
