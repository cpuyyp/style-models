According to The Last Lion - Defender of the Realm 1940-1965 by Manchester & Read (page 334), 40,000 British and ANZAC troops were evacuated from Greece in April 1941. That would leave about 15,000 total casualties - Killed, unevacuated wounded, and POW. Still from that source (page 356), Casualties in Crete a month later were 1,700 killed, 2,000 wounded, and 12,000 POW. Churchill himself in The Grand Alliance (page 232) lists attendance and evacuees in Greece as follows (from which my calculations give total evacuees and casualties on the last two lines): 

This mechanism would have had limited use in a naval vessel, because of the absence of a reversible gear drive. (The first such was invented by Filippo Bruneschelli during construction of the dome for Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence about 1420 AD.) Changing direction without one involved unharnessing all the oxen, reversing them on the platform, and re-harnessing them. Clearly performing such a maneuver in the midst of naval combat was impracticable. One exception to the above might have been for driving a fire-ship into an opposing fleet without risk to one's sailors. 

Note that the 9th and 10th open-sea explorations of the Norse were entirely performed in coastal waters or north of the North Atlantic Westerlies, and over the fairly short hops from Norway to Faeroes to Iceland to Greenland to Labrador - this is not accidental. Getting home was always easy by simply reaching (or rowing) south into the Westerlies and hoisting the square sail. Even over a short hop such as from Iceland to Greenland, comparable to a sail from Jutland to Scarborough, The Fate of Greenland's Vikings The combination of these advances - large ships able to sail upwind; better understanding of global wind patterns; and improved dead reckoning through the use of mechanical clocks and sand glasses together and a traverse board - were all unique to European sailors for over 200 years starting about 1450, giving them a complete monopoly on reliable long-distance open-sea ocean navigation through the period. Prior to this time, though limited open-sea navigation was performed by other cultures, the inability to reliably and predictably return to the origin limited its usefullness. 

In Book Two, Chapter 3, of The Gathering Storm, Winston Churchill quotes from his Cabinet memo of September 25, noting that he "struck a cool note". 

The American Civil War seems the obvious answer to me - expect for perhaps the English Civil War; or the Thirty Years War; or the Eighty Years War (Dutch Independence) depending on definition of mutiny. Perhaps the question needs to be closed 

Hitler was undisputedly mad but, in his madness, was an inspired orator with a natural intuition of how to leverage crowd psychology for his own evil ends. He also, as a flame attracts moths, attracted to himself those like Himmler with similar intentions, intuition, and madness, and who in turn were able to implement and manage the petty details of the Nazi Party's evil agenda. So to address your penultimate question ("Who developed such a great range of various deception and compelling techniques?") it was not a great range of compelling techniques, but a very simple and narrow technique - simply tell the biggest and most outrageous lie imaginable about your intentions and actions that claims to soothe the listener's fears. 

Because those other pennants already had internationally recognized meanings, that would have resulted in dangerous ambiguities: 

There were two Babylonian kings named Nebuchadnezzar, accepted to have ruled respectively c. 1125–1104 BCE and c. 605-562 BCE, and three Kings of Tyre named Hiram who are accepted to have rules respectively 980 – 947 BCE, 739–730 BCE, and 551–532 BCE. The only overlap or close between these dates is of Nebuchadnezzar II (c. 605-562 BCE) and Hiram III (551–532 BCE), but the accepted chronology has Hiram III ascending the throne a decade after the Nebuchadnezzar II and ruling for another two decades. This significant discrepancy in the dates is sufficient for me to discredit the cannibalism tales as being apocryphal. 

For reference, here is the official classification from Wikipedia of the conditions necessary for a "pleasant" Antarctic day: 

Churchill's reference to the line held by the Russians as "necessary" is to earlier discussions the previous summer between Poland and the Soviet Union, on the terms by which Russia would ally with Poland. The Soviet demand was to be allowed to advance their troops to this line as a suitable defensive measure by which to assist Poland. Poland refused this demand, subsequently leading to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Churchill states that he finds both the demand and the refusal reasonable stances for the respective parties, though mutually unfortunate. It is clear from these contemporary statements that Churchill is well aware of the violent hatred between the Communist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and fully intends to leverage that to British and Allied ends through the struggle against the Axis Powers. 

Given the pandemic anti-Semitism of the time, prevalent even in (more enlightened than Nazi Germany) countries such as the U.K., this criteria was certainly not met. It seems to me that this was a gesture known, even by its participants at the time, to be ultimately futile, but which was driven by the need to make a stand somewhere. 

The Highland Games Hammer Throw event for men uses either a 16 or 22 lb (7.2 or 10 kg) metal ball at the end of a 4 foot shaft, and is thrown with the feet in a fixed position (unlike the better known Olympic Hammer Throw, where the thrower can spin). This event is the direct predecessor for the Olympic Hammer Throw and seems likely to have evolved from the Medieval weapon of the same name. It seems unlikely to me that a hammer significantly heavier than the 10 kg hammer used in the heavyweight version of this event was ever more than a decorative or experimental weapon. 

This site estimates European Jewish population in 1935 to be 9.5 MM, about 1.7% of Total European population. It is unlikely that the Jewish percentage population in North America was much different than that, and worldwide would have been much smaller still. In regards to a boycott organized by such a small percentage of the population, I see a key prerequisite to it becoming more than a trivial nuisance: 

The Battle of Britain - The cream of the Luftwaffe fighter force was crippled in this battle because of suffering all their casualties over enemy territory. A bailed-out RAF or RCAF pilot was usually back at his aerodrome within 48-72 hours. A bailed-out Luftwaffe pilot would spend the next 5 years at Old Fort Henry, Canada, in a POW camp. Population Base - Fighter combat is very much an individual test of skills and will, especially when compared to ground combat. Reflexes, marksmanship, initiative, creativity and sheer determination at a very high level are required for success, and these combine in only a small proportion of the population. Germany had a population base of roughly 80MM to search through for these skills in combination, while the Allies had a population base several times that to search. Germany's advantage in command and control that played such a decisive role in ground combat simply was irrelevant in most air combats. Technology - Other than a brief period after the FW-190 came out, the Axis never had a fighter plane that surpassed those of Britain and the U.S. The Japanese had better technology a bit longer with the Zero, but still only until the F6 Hellcat came out. Without superior technology to compensate for a lower skill base, the normal attrition of combat was always going to increase the edge possessed by the Allies. 

The First partition of Poland is the only one (of the three) to occur before Frederick's death in 1786. From Encyclopedia Britannica: 

Well, there is little doubt about the door. This image of the South face taken in late afternoon (from here) clearly shows the entrance in the lower left: 

The most obvious single battle that was influenced by ENIGMA may, ironically, be the (early stages of the) Battle of the Bulge. Hitler's paranoia had finally advanced to such state in 1944 that he was convinced the Allies were eavesdropping on his intelligence; so he insisted that all plans drawn up for that attack NOT use the cracked cypher. It is likely that the Allies had become used to never being grossly surprised, leading to a degree of over confidence that cost lives in December 1944. Note that even though Hitler's conclusion was correct, this is still really just Hitler's paranoia showing though. The use of ENIGMA intelligence by the Allies was so sparing that he had no logical basis for this conclusion. Other than in the North Atlantic, where the battle was truly existential for the British, it was kept as a reserve to prevent exactly the scenario that occurred Dec. 16, 1944 - a massive German surprise attack in a weakly defended sector. In the Allied favour the key battle/campaign would be that of the merchant marine convoys in the North Atlantic through the dark days of 1941 and 1942. The British never realized that the Germans had broken the merchant marine codes in the mid 1930's, so it was only with the help of ENIGMA intelligence that sufficient convoys got through to keep Britain afloat as it were.
