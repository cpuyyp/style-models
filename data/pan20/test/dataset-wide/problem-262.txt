So this translates to a near-coastal swamp, perhaps partially brackish with mangrove-analogues, and dense forest cover. That being said, I can’t think of any natural location which could 100% match this setup, as well as give enough room for our sauropods to live. Odds are, you’d have to terraform/later the landscape to suit them, which would be very noticed. The closest natural matches are the mouths of the Congo and Amazon Rivers, but the problem is both of those locations are still travelled enough by humans that people would notice a couple sauropods in the area. This leads us to problem number two: Google Maps. Satellites will notice these areas, and will also likely spot any dinosaurs living in there. Frankly, unless you’re willing to spend money to make an underground swamp habitat, you’re not hiding these sauropods. Humans have eyes everywhere. Now, if you wanted to hide something smaller, say, a Hypsilophodon? That might work... 

Charlie here is right, in that this is a fairly ridiculous theory. However, the sheer ridiculousness of the concept reminded me of something that, while not quite as absurd as dinosaur fossils on Luna, is very similar in some aspects: Panspermia. For those who need reminding, Panspermia is the concept that tiny and simplistic microbial life forms can be 'ejected' from their homeworlds by way of impact ejecta, hitch-hike on these wayward meteoroids, and then spread to other worlds when their host meteor impacts another planetary body. Scientific experimentation on this theory (as of this date) has proven a bit iffy, but it's still a popular idea in sci-fi stories and video games. That being said, let's look back at the lunacy (nyuk-nyuk) of the Dinosaurs on the Moon idea. Suppose an incident similar to this happened earlier on in this planets history - say, when only microbial life forms exist on the surface. As several documentaries have claimed, there are potential places where life forms can survive extreme heat, even in nigh-apocalyptic conditions. Could a "Rapid Centrifugal Disintegration" event similar to this result in a planet and a moon with life forms derived from the same common ancestors? How could life survive it? Assuming they don't, could fossils of these microbial survivors even be found/survive to the civilized age? 

You're probably gonna hate me for this...but suppose that you just go with the obvious solution: the asteroid misses, and non-avian dinosaurs don't go extinct. Could humans evolve in an environment such as this? Well...probably? 

This is an answer I found while looking up random factoids. And it's gotten me wondering. ((If I should take down the picture, and just paraphrase the text, please let me know.)) 

I've got one good idea: quiz them on local news. If this time traveler really is from the future, he'd know about big historical events, like wars, country elections, mass-murderers, etc. What they DON'T record is small-time news, like celebrities, store/school closings, etc. So kids, if you suspect that you're speaking to someone from the 24th Millenium, just quiz them on the latest celebrity break-ups! If they don't know who you're talking about, then they're obviously from the future! Well...at least that's just one idea. 

Long ago, in the distant past of their homeworld, four separate species were able to evolve sentience on the planet Alpha Tucanae b: The Zoq, the Fot, the Pik, and the Zebranky. While the Zoq, Fot, and Pik were quite content collecting raw nutrients from their environment, the Zebranky were carnivorous, and took a liking to devouring the other three. This pressure from an outside threat caused the three separate species to put aside their differences, and band together to form an alliance; eventually, their combined efforts were able to completely eradicate the Zebranky. So what could happen is perhaps the civilizations could unify, and integrate into one society? Just some ideas. 

I'd advise looking to flying squirrels and bats for a good start. Similar pressures for those species could lead to primates doing the same thing. 

What folks typically mean is that Supercontinents tend to be dryer in the middle. What that means is that, as rainclouds flow from the sea inland, they'll drop all their rain closer to the coasts. This goes true for most continents, though: in North America, forests line the coasts, and prairies and deserts are nestled in the center. In Asia, there's a desert in the middle of the continent northwards of the Himalayas. Heck, Australia is a desert surrounded by shrub forests. The key to understanding this is geography and climate. 

Depends on the mass of the planets and the speed of the orbit. The larger the companion body, the more their gravitational pull will affect how long the days last. Essentially, a day and a "month" would last the same length for equal-sized tidally locked bodies. For more info, I'd recommend checking out this videoabout terrestrial moons; they briefly cover orbital mechanics, and it can also apply to co-orbital bodies. 

Turns out, water is a pretty darn good insulator from radiation! They use the same stuff to store old nuclear fission rods, when they go bad. And this useful trait has been considered for a lunar colony. Imagine an inner "safe room", surrounded by water to keep out harmful solar radiation during solar flares. That's basically the idea. Now don't take this as me saying your spaceships should be water-ships. Far from it, ya don't have to go that far. But consider this: during those longer treks, close to large gas giants and during heavy solar flares, your crew will need a little more protection from radiation. So a yellow alert sounds, and all staff are sent to the rad-bunkers: special rooms on the ship surrounded by a tank of water, with enough supplies and tools to wait out any high-radiation zones. Then, when the danger is passed, the crew exit, and return to their posts! Just an idea, but one with some basis in reality. And who knows? It might come in handy! 

3. While I myself am not one for violence or senseless hunting/killing, selectively reducing the populations of large dinosaurs in given areas could give humans room to build up stable and sturdy fortifications. Whether they can KEEP those locations is another matter. Like I said, a lot of this depends on which groups of dinosaurs you have in this environment, and how they have evolved. 65 million years is a long time to make evolutionary advancements, so there's a lot to consider here. Hope this helps. 

I kinda hate to say it in some was, but it might be impossible, in this day and age. Consider the following: Firstly, we must understand what Giraffatitan needs in its environment to be healthy and stable. Looking up on Wikipedia gives us: 

Here's a diagram of how winds work on a rotating planet (let's call it Earth, for simplicity's sake). As you can see, there are places where wind flows to and away from, due to the convection of air currents. Where winds tend to flow towards, there'll be greater chances of rain, and thus forests. Where the wind flows away, there'll be less rain, and therefore more deserts. You can see this in the simulated image of Pangea above. even though it's all one continent, there's a clear band of forests dividing the desert where the equator roughly is. In addition, whenever rain hits a mountain face, there will be a rain shadow. The rains will all be deposited on the windward side of the mountain, whereas the opposite side will be considerably dryer. The best example of this is the Himalayas; the Monsoons of India are all bottled up by the mountains, which leaves the Gobi Desert to the north dry and barren. 

Well, that depends on what you're expecting the turtles and varanids to do with their niche. But in general, it can definitely help. While I see a lot of the ideas in The Future is Wild to be a bit...too far, the Toraton is nearly exactly what you're describing for tortoises. They shifted their gait to be fully straight-legged, as opposed to sprawling, and thus it allowed them to get much, much bigger, turning them into sauropod-esque behemoths. 

As for monitor lizards, it can help, but based off their evolutionary history and biology, I'm skeptical. Personally, I could see varanids re-evolving into a new mosasaur lineage more than completely changing their gait. If you're really looking into active predation for varanids, then while it might be a bit of a stretch for varanids, a point of comparison I'd draw to are certain members of the early mammal lineage, like gorgonopsids and therocephalians. Similar body plan, similar diet, makes sense. 

See, proto-primates did exist during the Late Mesozoic. The question is, could they have evolved into proper primates, then apes, then hominids with dinosaurs running around? Well, considering that most arboreal dinosaurs ended up becoming actual birds, it's probable that Primates and other mammals could have "beaten" the dinosaurs to the punch in evolving a primate-like form. So considering this, there's a veeeeeeerrrrrrrry slim chance that, assuming they all kept out of reach, Humans could have evolved. Ultimately, it'd depend on which groups of dinosaurs made it to the present day. Since humans never would've evolved in Asia/the Americas, Tyrannosaurs and Deinonychosaurs could safely exist in this world, as could Ankylosaurs, Therizinosaurs, Hadrosaurs (heck, they're everywhere), and Ceratopsians. African Sauropods and Chacharodontosaurs might make this scenario harder, but hominids were able to last alongside Deinotherium and the like, so whose to say they couldn't against larger beasts? Bigger isn't always better, eh? As for those theories stating dinosaurs would probably stick closer to warmer climates, I say NAY! Assuming you have properly feathered dinosaurs, you could have dinosaurs in all climates, cold to hot, dry to swampy, high and low. Ultimately, for a world where humans and dinosaurs coexist, one of three things would need or have happen. 

So ultimately this is what determines your world's climate. It depends on the shape of the land, and how the winds hit it. Even if all the continents are together in one great landmass, it's rarely so simple as it seems. If you can determine where the mountains and lakes exist, then that'll determine the deserts and forests. Hope this helps, I'd love to help more if ya need it! 

As someone whose only understanding of economics comes from a single year's worth of a high school source on the subject, I have only this to say: Economics doesn't necessarily need to have currency. It does help, though. Trade as a whole just needs an imbalance. If I make pizza and you make pizza, then there's nothing really to trade; but if I make pizza, and you make burgers, suddenly we have reason to trade! You give me burgers, I give you pizza, and we both thrive from the trade. Where currency comes in is when value enters the picture. I mean, how many burgers is a pizza worth? What if I cut pizza into slices; how many burgers are worth a pizza slice? What if we add different things onto the burgers and pizza? We need a standard unit to attach value to, so that we can make sure nothing is gained or lost. Basically, all currency is is a placeholder. Something you attach value to, so that you can pay/be paid without having to trade actual goods. What that currency is can be anything of convenience: seeds, rocks, teeth... heck, the first minted coins came into existence in the year 600 A.D., a good 30,000 or so years after the earliest confirmed international trade began. So to answer your question, anything that can be easily recognized by a society can have value attributed to it. The possibilities are endless! 

Firstly, How dare you? Secondly, I'm not sure which toxins would fit best with those awful demonic entities, but whatever you find, make sure it will be compatible with the hornets' physiology. Wasps and hornets are carnivorous, so they can't afford to be poisoned by the very poison they used to kill their food. Then, breed a queen with the poison gene, and she'll make a new hive to devastate the world. Congrats on creating the worst apocalypse ever. ...have I mentioned I have an immense phobia of wasps and hornets? Also, HOW DARE YOU!? (Just joking, I'm sure you're very awesome and that this'll be an awesome bit for your world. I just saw this, and thought I'd give my two cents on this.) 

The Hill Sphere is a zone in which an object can safely orbit another body. Outside of that, the body will fling off into space. So the solar system as we know it exists within the sun's Hill Sphere. Now, as mentioned before, gravity is also a function of mass. So if two similarly-sized objects get close to one another, then they both enter one another's Hill spheres, and thus will become gravitationally attracted to one another. And if they're in stable orbits before hand, then they can possibly be knocked out of orbit, sending them flying away or crashing into the parent body, which brings me to... 

Short answer: ...eh? Maybe. ...but I'm sure you're wanting more details than that, so here's some research! Roche Limits & Hill Spheres Or: How I Learned to Respect Gravity . 

2. Humans could take a page from Dinotopia, and basically have mobile towns atop Sauropod herds. Imagine houses on individual dinosaurs. Traveling together in a herd. The humans could hunt smaller species which hang around sauropods, or even take a couple of the great herbivores for themselves once in a while, and in turn protect the herd from other threats. ...fanciful, I know, but hey. It could fit in your world! :) 

I'll bring out a little idea that's been considered for lunar colonization; while it might work better for a station than a ship, it's still worth considering, I say. Water 

Roche Limit There's an inner limit to the Hill Sphere called the Roche Limit. Past this limit, the gravitational forces experienced by any orbiting body become so great that it literally rips the body apart. Within this limit, either a body will become shredded into a ring system or just crash into the planet. Those of you reading this may remember the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which was ripped apart by Jupiter after it got too close. This is why it was ripped apart. As the comet drew closer and closer, the gravity of Jupiter overpowered the gravity c=holding the comet together, ripping it into pieces. Conclusion So now that you know about these two forces, let's look back at your scenario. One star, two Earth-size planets within the habitable zone, and 5 moons split between them. The scenario is doable, but there's a catch. The planet should have to be far enough apart that their Hill spheres do not cross one another, yet close enough to both fit into the Goldilocks zone. Otherwise, their moon systems will become entangled, and the moons will careen into either of the planets or the star. Then ya won't have any habitable Worlds. Very rare setup, definitely. But is this scenario doable? Absolutely.
