For each point x of the curve C, π(x) is the intersection of the line through p and x with L. The fiber π^-1(y) of π over a point y of L is the intersection of the line through p and y with the curve. Thus fibers of π correspond to lines through p. This suggests that the number of points on different fibers of π is a constant equal to d, and that the fibers vary in a “linear family”. Lines through p tangent to C meet C in fewer than d points, so π represents C as a “branched cover” of degree d over L, which is a covering space except over images of those tangential intersections. Algebraically we are taking a polynomial in x and y, fixing y, and representing the fiber over y as the solutions of the resulting polynomial in x. That polynomial generically has degree d in x, and branching occurs when it has multiple roots. Rational functions of y which are regular at y0 pull back to (the same) rational functions on C, regular at points (x,y0) over y0, as in Hartshorne’s definition of morphism. 

Here is a simple example. Someone asked me if the unit disc is an affine variety. the answer is no. To see why not, assume yes, and take the projective closure. then one gets a projective curve which is a compact 2 dimensional surface with some points identified, and which differs from the original surface by at most adding a finite number of points. But this is impossible. No compact surface can be reduced to a disc by removing a finite number of points, even topologically, except for removing one point from P^1. But that does not give the disc by Liouville's theorem. A more significant and pervasive example is the fact that at every singular point of an affine variety, the tangent cone determines a projective variety. Thus projective geometry is the local aspect of affine geometry. Put another way, blowing up an affine variety, at a point say, introduces projective geometry into it as a picture of its infinitesimal structure. One can sometimes use this trick to compute the degree of a proper map of affine or other varieties, by restricting to the behavior over the projective normal bundle of a single fiber. See e.g. Friedman - Smith (Inventiones, 67, (1982)), who compute the degree of the prym map by showing that a single projective fiber of the proper prym map is embedded in projective space by the derivative of the prym map acting on the normal bundle to the fiber. 

this seems to be the kodaira vanishing theorem. i.e. any line bundle of form K+A where is ample, has no higher cohomology. for an abelian variety K is trivial, and Theta is ample. qed. 

To supplement these expert answers, I want to give one that at least to me shows how to use geometry to think of the algebraic proof. Not being an algebraic thinker this sort of thing is crucial for me, and indeed by thinking in these terms I was able to do this initially puzzling, although elementary, computation in my head. The key idea is that of a partition of unity, that allows one to decompose a global element into a sum of local elements. I apologize for revisiting this old and elementary question, but it is basic and I think it is worth trying again, as Georges did, to expose the geometric idea behind the algebra. To prove: if R is an S algebra and spec(R) has an open covering by basic open sets Ufj j=1,...m, such that each affine ring Rfj is finitely generated as S algebra, where the functions fj generate the unit ideal in R, then R is also finitely generated as S algebra. proof: To take advantage of the hypothesis, we want to restrict an element h of R, thought of as a function on spec(R), to each open set Ufj, then write each restriction in terms of a finite number of elements of R, and add back up to get h itself in terms of a finite number of elements of R. But since the sets Ufj overlap, the naive restrictions will not add back to h. Thus we want to use the more subtle restriction obtained from a “partition of unity”. I.e. if we write the constant 1 as a sum of functions each supported in the Uj, then by multiplying h by these functions, we can write h also as such a sum. Since the fj generate the unit ideal we have functions gj such that f1g1+...+fmgm = 1. Thus given h = h.(f1g1)+...+h.(fmgm), it suffices to write each “restriction” h.(fjgj) as an S linear combination of monomials in terms of a finite number of elements of R, which are independent of h. If we restrict h to Uj in the naive sense, we have by hypothesis that h is an S linear combination of monomials involving a fixed finite number of elements of form r/fj^s, with r in R; hence for some t, h.fj^(s+t) is an S linear combination of monomials in a fixed finite set of elements of R, if we add fj to the finite set of elements r. Now using the fact that 1^N = 1, for any N, we can form our partition of unity using any power of the fj. Thus for any n, we can write h = h.(f1^n.G1)+...+h.(fm^n.Gm) where each h.(fj^n) is an S linear combination of monomials in a given finite number of elements of R, hence (after including the Gj among the finite set of elements) also h.(fj^n.Gj), hence also h. 

It depends partly what you are more interested in, geometry or analysis. There are two relevant categories: compact complex manifolds of dimension one (and holomorphic maps), and algebraic complex curves (and rational maps). The approach in the wonderful book of Miranda is to consider the functor from algebraic curves to compact complex one manifolds, although he never fully proves it is well defined. The more analytic approach is to begin with compact complex one manifolds and prove they are all representable as algebraic curves. This is probably the approach of Forster. Another excellent analytic monograph from this point of view is the Princeton lecture notes on Riemann surfaces by Robert Gunning, which is also a good place to learn sheaf theory. His main result is that all compact complex one manifolds occur as the Riemann surface of an algebraic curve. Miranda's book contains more study of the geometry of algebraic curves. Riemann himself, as I recall, took an intermediate view, showing the equivalence of the categories of (irreducible) algebraic curves with that of (connected) compact complex manifolds equipped with a finite holomorphic map to P^1. Another extremely nice book, a little more advanced than Miranda, is the China notes on algebraic curves by Phillip Griffiths. Mumford's book Complex projective varieties I, also has a terrific chapter on curves from the complex analytic point of view. After you learn the basics, the book of Arbarello, Cornalba, Griffiths, Harris, is just amazing. Of course Riemann's thesis and followup paper on theory of abelian functions is rather incredible as well. Thanks to Georges Elencwajg for significant corrections to this answer.
