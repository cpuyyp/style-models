Intuitively, this type of Euclidean pseudo compactification would only work for countable ordinals such as ωω, pictured here. One can (almost) imagine extending this picture to a higher countable ordinal by replacing each ordinal in this depiction with a copy of ωω to obtain something like ωω2 perhaps(?) (I'm not sure). Imagining further substitutions beyond that, things become less clear. The first uncountable ordinal ( ω1 ) would be at the "limit of the limit of the limit ..." of this process - if that makes any sense. This sort of doodling is fun, but unfortunately it does not say anything about the formal, topological view of compactness among the ordinals. 

I'm still not sure that your question is clear enough to answer, but I'm willing to give it one more go. Your question is : Are there two different mathematics in philosophy? On the surface the answer would appear to be no. However, it is possible to make a case for yes. If you take a Platonist view of the subject, which I believe would be the majority view amongst mathematicians, then mathematics exists independent of ability to articulate its truths. So from this point of view, clearly there are two different mathematics - the real and the human. Although we have articulated some of the truths, it is not clear that we have done it correctly. When I say "correctly", I don't mean we have made errors, I mean that our articulation may not be a true representation of the subject. For example, in the 1950's, people noticed that our theory of elliptic curves could be considered to be part of complex analysis, and not a separate theory at all. (I believe this follows from a result called The Modularity Theorem.) Accordingly, both theories might actually be articulations of the theory of L-functions. Maybe this is the true nature of the mathematics. L-functions also appear to indicate that the algebra of Galois Theory and the theory of analytic functions in the complex plain are different articulations of the same mathematics. But what makes us so sure that L-functions are the correct view. Maybe they are manifestations of some deeper mathematical truth. Etc.... As you have noted in your comments, our mathematics, no matter how abstract or remote, can be seen to be rooted in our real world experience. You mention string theory, which is rooted in geometry. Similarly, our theory of large cardinals is demonstrably remote (provably undecidable), but it is rooted in the act of counting. Surely reality includes aspects well beyond our ability to experience, just as it must surely be the case that mathematics includes provable truths which are beyond our ability to imagine or root in our human experience. So my naive reading of your question leads me to the answer YES, I think it is fair to say that most mathematicians would agree with the idea that there are two different mathematics in philosophy. ASIDE I appreciate that this may be a pretty crappy argument, but "hey", I'm not trying to make a thesis of it. It's the best I can do with the time at hand. 

The major disagreement on beauty comes from not a disagreement on beauty but relative perception of such due to other factors. For example, when looking at a scenery, you may evoke certain memories which may lead you to classify something more beautiful than you would have if there were no memories attached to it. If you strip beauty of those definitions that encompass subjective perceptions arising from subject's own emotions, then beauty tends to looked at as objective rather than subjective. 

If the text is assumed to be factual from the time of author, it is probably not a metaphor, as author did not try to clarify as such nor was successful in making people understand the purpose and content of text. If the text is widely popular during that time, then it probably would have undergone this criticism. This might appear dishonest but actually whether text is right or not is good way of determining whether it is a metaphor. "With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures. In short, it must be said that our authors knew the truth about the nature of the skies, but it was not the intention of the Spirit of God, who spoke through them, to teach men anything that would not be of use to them for their salvation." (St. Augustine - De Genesi ad literam, 2:9) 

In recent years, a multiverse view of reality has become mainstream. Here, our universe is just one instance of many universes that make up a multiverse. In this vision, the multiverse is infinite in both directions. 

It may just be an oversight, but when you say "hence we can write a computer program that, given any proof, will eventually produce that proof", it is not at all clear what you want to say. What does it mean, if you give a computer a proof, then it produces that proof. I think it is fair to say that the approach you are describing is what a mathematician would call "proof by exhaustion", rather than "proof by experimentation". The Four Colour Theorem's computer generated proof consists of exhausting all possibilities. On the other hand, experimentation can be used to disprove a mathematical proposition. For example, if we used a computer to discover a very, very large even natural number that was not expressible as the sum of two primes, then we would disprove the Goldbach conjecture. 

Obviously the validity of this method requires that you accept the validity of the stated three laws of thought. People who study logic also consider logical systems where laws 2 and 3 are not included. Some may even reject law 1, though one can only wonder why. 

It is an interesting observation that you make, since, on the surface, the two "statement functions" appear to express contradictory things. Your headline question "How can a statement function make no definite assertion about anything?" is answered with the obvious response : because that is how the author has defined a statement function in the quoted text. When one reads a statement function such as Sx ⊃ Px, one needs to ask "what x?" before one can impose any meaning, and this is what the quantifiers do. As the author states, the green expressions (statement functions) cannot be translated as a statement, so according to the author's intentions it is not correct to say than the green expressions "match, and so assert" the statement "S are P". Indeed, according to the quoted text, a statement function makes no assertion. The author's example shows how quantification of a "statement function" can impose meaning onto the resulting statement, and that different quantifiers can yield quite different symbolic translations and meanings. EDIT If you are familiar with the concept of function in mathematics, then just as a mathematical function has no meaning without a domain, in logic a statement function has no meaning until its domain is specified by quantification. 

Harris is contradicting himself. That is perhaps because he is an admirer of Buddhism and while Buddhism, in some sense, allows materialism to hold within its philosophy, the spiritual aspect of it often leads to contradictions like Harris espouses. He wants to hold to materialism and non-religious, non-theistic spirituality and does not know how to do it. 

There is an external world and there is us. Our illusions do not change external world but can change our own state of mind and thus our attitude, behaviour, and responses to situation. Now, if illusion produces a result that makes us more adaptable to our surroundings, then it might be considered to be desirable (pragmatically). A very good and often used example is that if you have fear of speaking in front of large crowds then you must imagine that the room is empty. This lowers your anxiety and thus helps you speak better because your own anxiety was making you less adaptable to the situation (where best thing for you would obviously be to speak). Some would say that this is not exactly going against reality but actually diminishing an irrational and unreal fear by thinking of contrast. Here, I am reminded of Victor Frankl's book, "Man's Search For Meaning". In the second part "Logotherapy in a Nutshell", he talks about antcipatory anxiety. It is according to him counterable by paradoxical intention. It is not exactly creating an illusion though. The point is in order to remove a fear, best thing would be not to think it. Thinking about it makes you aware of it even more and that causes a viscious cycle of action and reaction (a sort of system with a positive feedback greater than unity) that results in hyper-sensitisation to the problem and thus more severe symptoms. That would require either understanding its extent and not over-reacting or ignoring or thinking of something else, or thinking the event to be something else. Sometimes, the last option is most easy and immediate. However, the illusion may actually cause more problems. Thinking that there is no one in room, you may blurt out something that the audience may not like or is improper, hence ruining everything. Because our reactions to the world may not always be in a way that best ensure our interests (because of mental factors and the fact that we can think) and the very fact that what is does not mean what ought to be, sometimes it is better pragmatically to artificially produce those responses, by changing the mental factors, that are best according to our needs and interests. Determination of that requires extensive understanding in itself. However, if it is possible then it is an option. However, if you specifically want to aks why people choose an illusion over reality and not whether and when they should choose it, well that is question related mostly to psychology and not philosophy. Illusions appear real. You have to work to see through them, What would be an incentive for a person to do something which would take away from him what is making him happy? And even if there is some, some people might ignore it if it is not clearly visible to them. It is not surprising that some people refuse to work (apply extra thinking) to make themselves unhappy (or so they feel). 

How can we prove the material implication without first establishing what the truth values of p and q must be? 

Considering your specific question, theory-ladenness applies specifically to scientific observations. If we are to identify theory-ladenness in an observation such as "Ice melts in the sun", then we need first to express this observation using scientific terms - e.g., H2O molecules undergo a phase transition from solid to liquid at a temperature above zero degrees C. (Note that I have modified your observations since if it is minus 50C, then ice won't melt whether the sun is out or not.) The theory-ladenness of this observation is now evident, since interpretation requires an understanding of molecular theory, temperature, etc.. More generally, it is not clear that the quoted description of theory-ladenness by Adam White is well-expressed. For example, it does not account for the case where an observation is made that falsifies (all) existing theory. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier's experiments with oxygen led to observations that falsified the prevailing phlogiston theory. The absence of alternative theory meant that these observations could not be interpreted, leading to the need for new theories to be formulated. It may be that theory-ladenness is intended to apply only to post-19th century science. Prior to the 20th century, science was observation driven. We did our experiments, made our observations, and then formulated a theory to fit the observations. This changed in the 20th century when science became theory driven. We now formulate our theories and then make observations to confirm (or falsify) our theories. Whatever the case, the problem of an uninterpretable, falsifying observation remains if we are to use the quoted description. 

As long as you have a goal with an end involving the people that you are using, such that if it becomes a universal law (and thus, applicable on you too), you have no problem, but you actually will that for yourself, then you are fine. 

You may be happy in doing anything like rolling in sand, putting hands in a sack of grains, dancing impromptu, or putting ice cubes on your tongue. If you read Camus, you will see his characters get pleasure in all the things that somehow stir our emotions and make us happy - like lust for power etc. You become sad if you realise how meaningless they are or how they are immoral. However, if you accept that and accept that there is nothing better possible, and accept your fate (with disdain), then you will grow out of your search of trying to find a non-existent meaning. If you disregard there is something "better", that there are values, you will be out of the moral-immoral conflict in your head. And, thus you will be happy. An absurdist is like a person who ignores that he will die one day ((ignores that life is meaningless) except that absurdist knows, accepts and does not ignore that he will die one day. Consider Don Juan. He moves from one woman to next. He does not desire true love. He just wants to get most enjoyment from present moment. He knows the limitations. He knows that he won't get true love and he does not want it. The only happiness he has is the happiness that he experiences because of his acts. He does not hate what he does and what he does tickles his "happiness-inducing" senses. Hence there is no guilt but just petty happiness and it is all that he wants. Whether this position can actually be defended and absurdist view can be held consistently is beyond the topic as Camus does not talk about that (whether Don will be one day realise how much better true love is and regret his actions), however, what is certain is that people do find happiness in acts that do not make a whole lot of sense - you might have seen those duck-faced selfies;) 

I believe this may be related to the Berry Paradox. The Berry Paradox asks : What is the smallest number not nameable in under ten words? We can answer this by saying "the smallest number not nameable in under ten words". But by saying that we have expressed this number in under ten words - a contradiction, thus invalidating the question. EDIT The reason we can answer Berry's question the way we do is due to the well-ordering of the natural numbers. Every set of natural numbers has a least member. 

Physical objects have some universal properties - for example, symmetries and asymmetries. An object such as a chair is the aggregate of various symmetries and asymmetries. The terms "front" and "back" are names we use to identify a particular type of asymmetry. In the case of a chair, the front has a seat while the back does not - an asymmetry. An object without asymmetry, such as a blank piece of paper, cannot have a (well-defined) front and a back. EDIT Some objects have certain types of asymmetries which we choose to name front and back. Such objects must have sides. Sides are another type of asymmetry. An object such as a sphere has no asymmetries and so has no sides and no front or back. An object such as a cube has asymmetry which we name sides but no well-defined front or back (in the absence of other distinguishing asymmetries). An object such as a chair has asymmetry in the form of sides and other asymmetries in the form of front and back. 

In subjective idealistic reality, morality may exist. One of the classical ways in which morality may be understood in a subjective reality is based on doctrine of ignorance and illusion (refer Advaita Vedanta). All actions that are reaffirmation of illusion and ignorance are immoral and all actions that are taken in light of knowledge may be classified as moral. Because actions like murder are based primarily on assumption of duality of the observer and the observed,they will still be immoral. For e.g., the motivation for murder may be hate which may result from a feeling of being cheated upon by another person. However, if either the cheater or the cheated is a figment of imagination, then murdering someone based on that is reaffirmation of illusion and falsity. Note - In Advaita Vedanta, morality, at the highest level of reality is assumed to be illusion. However, it can be argued to exist based on the above mentioned criterion. 

An appeal to authority is almost never valid. However, if it is declared as such and accepted by both parties, it is alright to use it. First thing to know is that it is an informal fallacy. So it is wrong or right depending on the way it is used or more precisely what inference does the person using it wants the other party to draw. If the inference to be drawn is about the truth of a belief or proposition, then such appeal is never valid. If the person putting appeal to authority uses it to justify his belief or having a particular belief, then it may be not be fallacious to use it. Here hidden assumption is that it is justified to have those beliefs that are held by experts in a field.
