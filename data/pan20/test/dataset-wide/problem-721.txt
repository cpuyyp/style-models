If you are looking for a perfect saddle according to your current position, you will spend a lot of money and never be happy with your purchase. Marketers have created "specialized" (not the brand) seats so that we as consumers will buy more. Think the number of variations you see in running shoe, or tooth paste. They will all do the same thing with relatively equivalent effect. The only thing different about them is the description and minor details. Based on my experience, I have been able to change positions between casual and aggressive, depending on fitness, health and general season in life while keeping the same saddle. How your bike fits dictates your riding comfort more than your saddle type. Review what changing to aggressive position does. First, you are lowering your handlebars, this alters the amount of weight you support with your arms and therefore changes how you hold yourself overall on your bike. The change also incrementally increases the distance between your saddle and handlebars - which in turns puts more stress on your saddle region. To counteract this change, move your saddle forward. The best way to do this would be to measure from saddle front to the of your stem pre-adjustment. Slam your stem and move your seat forward until the distance between your stem and seat is equivalent. This will help, but going into an aggressive position by definition trades some comfort for aerodynamics. That being said, I don't want you to think I'm not for buying a new saddle. Just have the right motivation. Get one that fits your hip bone shape and has the right amount of padding that you desire personally - ignore the spec mumbo-jumbo. I have an older model Fizik Arione and love it. I highly recommend it regardless of your riding position. 

Standing up on a bike, especially when you lack fitness, is a good way to go "anaerobic." Put simply, that means your body is working so hard, it can't get enough oxygen. You can only do that for a short amount of time, which for most people is in the range of 10-30 seconds. Then the lactic acid build up in your muscles becomes too painful and you are forced to ease up. The solution is simple. You need more strength and fitness. If you like to ride fast and/or climb hills, you can't avoid the anaerobic zone completely, but you can move it a little farther away by getting good fitness. Keep riding, and keep riding hills. 

I don't necessarily clip out and put my foot down, but I stop. These rules have worked for me pretty well. But one thing I've never worried about is my safety, when I stop. I've easily ridden 100,000 miles on the roads, including the East Bay, in all kinds of conditions. I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I felt less safe stopping than not stopping. There are plenty of things out there to worry about, but that isn't one of them. 

Don't neglect your core and upper body. If your core is weak, your ability to balance, lift, and jump the bike will also be weak. 

If it's a multi-way stop and there's another car waiting or just arriving, I stop. If I can't clearly see or judge what I'm riding into, I stop. If it doesn't feel right for some reason, I stop. If there's a cop there (or a history of cops), I stop. 

On some headsets which use a cartridge bearing in the lower assembly, the crown "race" is split. Also, I know a lot of people split their crown race for the ease of installation. Perhaps I'm overly concerned, but I'm wondering about two things. 

I've just, for the first time, finished servicing the hubs on my bicycle. They are of the cup & cone type (Shimano). The cones of the front hub where pitted so I got them replaced, along with the bearing balls. The cups still looked smooth. I've packed them with a generous amount of grease and adjusted them for minimal play when out of the fork / no play when the QR is closed. When I turn the axle by hand it feels smooth. However, with the front wheel installed, when I lift the front and give the wheel a spin, there is some clicking/scratching noise. It only seems to be present when running at a certain speed. My guess is these are the bearings touching each other? Is this normal? 

Has anyone ever cracked a crown race during use? If this is something that can happen, a split crown race might shatter into pieces.. The crown race is held somewhat snug by the chamfered edge of the bearing, which suggests it might prevent a broken crown race from falling of the fork. Has anyone ever crashed due to the crown race / lower headset assembly failing? 

Really, it's all about your core. Your legs need leverage to push the pedals, and that comes from your core. Crunches are probably the best exercise you can do to improve your cycling. You help stabilize your core with your back and arms, so put a pull up bar in a doorway, and do pull ups. That's all you need to do. You definitely don't need to do a weight routine. You don't even have to get fancy. Back in the day when I was a serious cyclist, I was doing 200 crunches and 40 pull-ups almost every day. Half in the morning, half in the evening. That's a little extreme for most people, but I was a little extreme back then. 

Those are paired spokes, and there's a reason they pair them up. If that was a rear wheel, I might ride it a mile or two if I had to. But not a front wheel. I'm really curious how you managed to break five spokes in one 90 degree section of that wheel. That's not normal behavior. There is something really wrong with that wheel. 

To do 528 miles through the desert, in monsoon season, in less than a week is going to be quite an ordeal. You are looking at averaging 75 miles a day to do it in 7 days. You'll be out alone, in the middle of nowhere. I won't say you can't do it, because it can be done. But it's clear you've never done anything of this magnitude. Lots of posts have given you good advice. My advice is to shorten the route. Take the train or bus, or bum a ride as close as you can get to the Arizona border. Cut your distance in half, and your odds of being successful improve dramatically. 

For most casual group rides I've ridden, there are points where the lead pack pauses to wait for dropped riders (usually at the top of climbs). When the last dropped rider has regrouped, the pack immediately starts off again. I've always wondered why this is, would not the last rider be the one most in need of rest (especially if it's me!). If time were an issue, why not just keep going leaving slower riders to go at their own pace? If concerned about keeping the group together, why not slow down? 

Drive trains with a front derailleur system are designed with to have overlapping gear ratios ranges for each front chain ring to allow you to spend most of your time riding with the chain not stretched to the extremes of your rear cassette. Riding in your largest gear on both your front and rear is call Cross Chaining. Cross Chaining puts unnecessary stress on your drive chain system by forcing your chain to work through extreme angles to propel your bike forward. Additionally, you'll get a grinding noise when using the most extreme gear combinations as you are forcing your chain to go from front to extreme back. Best best to avoid that sound is to practice shifting both your front and rear derailleur. Starting out, it may feel awkward but your bike and ears will thank you ;-). It is worth spending some money at the mechanic to give it a good inspection to make sure everything is in safe working condition as well. Nothing is worse than having something break when you are riding. 

I'm currently running a pair of clip-on aerobars (Syntace C2) on my long distance touring bike. I've set the aerobars up quite high, as for me they are not so much about the aero-part (though it still helps when battling strong headwinds), but mostly about giving my wrists some rest and a change of posture. So far, I really like them. However, I feel like I could benefit from a bit more reach when riding on the flat bar, so I'm thinking about changing out the stem for a slightly longer one with a bit less rise. This is where the trouble starts, since that would bring the aero's way to far away from the saddle. In fact, they could already benefit from a slightly shorter stem. Thus it seems like a double stem setup (such as some TD racers use) would solve this problem. 1 short stem up high for the aero's, and 1 long stem for the flats. However, the part of the steerer which sticks out is only 68mm. 

Edit: I ask this because I consider splitting a race. I'm switching out a RS Reba for a Surly 1x1 fork, both of which have a crown seat diameter of approx. 30mm (as do all 1.125" forks, as far as I know). I tried setting it using my "specialized race setting tool" (i.e. some PVC piping and a mallet) and plenty of lube. No luck however, the pipe started to shatter but the race wouldn't set :-(. It seems like the seating is just a hair too wide for the race to seat. As far as I see there are two options: file down the crown seating a bit, or split the race. The latter seems easier; also I'd rather modify a 3€ part than a 50€ one. But only if I won't loose my teeth over it :-P. 

I'd recommend hitting up a local bike shop for recumbent bike options. Since product availability is pretty location specific, only this general advice is helpful. Even recommending a particular website may not be helpful depending on your country of residence. Regarding handle bars: your entire position on your bike is going to have changed in the 10 years of recovery (welcome back!). Getting your bike professionally fitted is well worth looking into. I did so after getting hit by a car. Not all bike shops offer this service though so it may require some searching online to find a place that offers fitting. Generally speaking, you will probably find a more upright position more comfortable. That means raising your handlebars and possibly pushing your seat forward. Raising your handlebars can be done with spacers as well as purchasing a new stem with a steeper angle. It's best to get these options dialed in in real-time with a professional that you can give immediate feed back to. Regarding handlebars specifically, refer to @Criggie's comment. Handlebars are generally system specific and would require more than just swapping the bars. 

Due to the critical job of your brakes in helping you race safely, the wiser action is to replace your equipment rather than try to fix this type of break. The shifting and brake system may work now but the system is compromised and can fail at any time regardless of how you patch it up. It's hard to swallow, for sure, but you are putting yourself and those you are racing/riding with at risk by continuing to use broken equipment. Depending on the age of your shifters, Shimano equipment can be mixed and matched so if the price of replacement at the highest level is too much you can look into replacing with Ultegra or 105 without noticing a great dip in performance.
