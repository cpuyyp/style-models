Background on Milnor fibers: Suppose a smooth complex plane curve acquires an isolated singularity f(x,y) = 0 with Milnor number µ = dim.C[[x,y]]/(∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y), and r local branches. Then we know from the theory of plane curve singularities, [Milnor’s Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces p.45], that a small spherical neighborhood of the singular point meets a nearby smooth curve C(t) in a manifold -with -boundary M, the Milnor fiber, obtained from a compact Riemann surface of genus g by removing r discs. Here g = ∂ + 1 – r, where ∂ = (1/2)(µ -1+r) is the algebraic geometer’s version of µ. General fiber = the special fiber plus the Milnor fiber (topologically) Thus a topological model of the nearby smooth curve is obtained by making a connected sum of this bordered manifold M with the normalization of the singularity, i.e. with the bordered manifold obtained by removing a small neighborhood of the singularity on the singular curve. Conjectural structure of the stable reduction Since the stable reduction of such a degeneration arises algebraically by blowing up, the normalization of the singular curve should in general be a component of the stable limit. Since also the arithmetic genus is constant in a family, it seems the stable limit should be in general obtained topologically from the normalization by wedging on the result of collapsing the r boundary curves of the Milnor fiber, i.e. algebraically by adding in a non singular curve of genus g, touching the normalization once at each branch. Examples: 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

this is similar to some other answers. when i took basic graduate algebra from Maurice Auslander he handed out 16 pages of very terse notes the first day that he said was our Fall semester final exam. There were four sections and each of us was assigned to read, learn and write up in more detail one section. They were on i) depth, ii) modules of finite projective dimension, iii) regular local rings, iv) unique factorization domains. To give an idea of the style, the first sentence defined M depth N (modules over any ring) to be (when finite) the smallest degree such that Ext(M,N) is non zero. One page later he proved this integer (if finite) equals the length of a maximal N regular rad(A) sequence where A = ann(M), if R is noetherian and M,N finitely generated. In the second section he defined projective dimension and related it for fin gen modules over noetherian local rings to the length of a minimal free resolution and the non vanishing of Tor. He then proved the formula relating depth and the dimensions of R,M. He used without proof facts such as tensoring with flat algebras commutes with Ext and (if faithfully flat) leaves projective dimension unchanged. In section 3 he characterized when noetherian local rings are regular in terms of global dimension, projective dimension of modules, and regular sequences, and equated global dimension with krull dimension for such rings. In the last section he showed every regular local ring is ufd, and the formal power series ring over any regular ufd is also regular ufd. I did not yet know what an ideal was when I started the semester. You never forget a class like that. 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written? 

You probably know all of this already, but here goes... Write $C'_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} p_{x,w} T_x$ where $p_{x,w} \in u\mathbb{Z}[u]$. Now, the other basis can be defined by applying the involutive automorphism $b: \mathcal{H}_n \to \mathcal{H}_n$, given by $b(T_w)=T_w$ and $b(u)=-u^{-1}$. 

This is really a long remark. The concept of a general hyperplane is used here to prove that the degree of a curve is well defined. I.e. that there exists a non empty Zariski open set of hyperplanes whose intersection with the given curve consists of d distinct points of multiplicity one. But if one wants to actually compute the degree, this definition is insufficient. I.e. one can calculate only with a specific hyperplane, but the answer is correct only if it is also “general”. The knowledge that most hyperplanes are general is of little help. This is why one usually proves also that a hyperplane all of whose intersections have multiplicity one, is indeed general. This gives a computable criterion for generality. E.g. when Mumford computes the number of lines on a smooth cubic surface in his little yellow book, he first shows that most cubic surfaces have the same finite number of lines, and then proves that smoothness is a sufficient condition for a surface to have this number of lines. Then he checks that the Fermat surface is smooth and computes on that one. Sometimes it is so difficult to find a specific example that is general, that one is forced to compute with a non general one. In his book on algebraic curves, Fulton gives a formula for the local multiplicity of the intersection of two curves at a point, and shows that, at least theoretically, one can compute the Bezout number even if the curves do not intersect everywhere with multiplicity one. B. Segre gives in his book on cubic surfaces a lovely example where he computes the number of lines on a general cubic surface by using as example the highly non general case of the union of 3 general planes! Here a small deformation, to a general cubic, is defined by another cubic which meets each of the three lines of intersections of a pair of the original planes in 3 points. He then computes that a line lying in one of the 3 planes is the specialization of a line on a general deformation surface, if and only if it meets both of the other two planes at one of the distinguished points. Thus there are 9 such lines in each of the three planes, for a total of 27 lines on a general cubic surface. 

Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups by Predrag Cvitanovic has a graphical way of presenting the idempotents. His book is available online here: $URL$ 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

Here's a recent example. $URL$ Adam McDougall constructs a "diagramless" homology theory that ends up being essentially equivalent to Khovanov homology. 

The Euclidean ball takes up the most space in dimension 5. $V = \frac {8 \pi^2} {15} R^5 \approx 5.26\ldots R^5$ 

Aaron Lauda has a nice description using the package XY-pic here. There are commands that generate pieces of knots (such as crossings in various orientations), although I prefer just using the \crv "curve" command to make splines. 

As an alternative to Francesco's nice geometric argument, the answer to question 1 is no, by definition of "hyperelliptic". I.e. a curve is hypereliptic if it has a line bundle of degree 2 with more than one section. If g = 3, any effective even theta charcteristic is such a line bundle. As to the subvariety M(1,g), this was (mostly) understood already by Riemann. I.e. if we look at the image of M(g) in the space of prin.pol. abelian varieties, then M(1,g) is just the intersection of Jacobians with the ample divisor defined by the vanishing of the theta function, hence it has pure codimension one, and is non empty. If g-1 is twice an odd number, the presence of hyperelliptics in this locus avoids the use of ampleness. 

The first section of Representation Theory by Fulton and Harris is a great introduction to representations of finite groups (about a quarter of the book, if I remember correctly). There are lots of examples and exercises. The rest of the book is devoted to Lie theory. 

When $n=2$, the map is an isomorphism and we have no choice. $$F^{(2)} = \frac{1}{[2]}(T_1+q^{-1}),$$ which projects onto the $q$-eigenspace for $T_1$. In other words, it is the idempotent corresponding to the partition $(2)$. 

Caveat lector: This does not address your questions directly, but I think that it's interesting and somewhat relevant. The $n$th Catalan number counts the number of walks of length $2n$, beginning and ending at the origin, in the positive cone of the root lattice of type $A_1$. This counts the dimension of the invariant subspace of endomorphisms of $2n$-fold tensor power of the standard irrep $V$, relating back to Scott's answer. This phenomenon generalizes to other root systems. 

there are probably more results that are simply not known in characteristic 2. I am guilty of not deciding some results in that case, such as the paper Comp.Math. 1990. pp.367 ff. As I recall in this case it was a matter of not having a Taylor series in degree two, because we could not divide by 2. I apologize, but after all that work, I was satisfied with a result valid in all characteristics ≥ 3. 

I think this is a difficult and significant question, and I have appreciated the answers to date. I am hoping to learn more about this topic from further answers, since I have struggled with this challenge all my career. I think it is widely felt that great problem finders are more rare than great problem solvers. Still I am motivated to try to answer it myself although I don’t feel well qualified to do so. And I hope I may learn something by thinking about it. I suggest a naive preliminary question: is one trying to solve the deepest possible problem, or to have as much fun as possible? Some of us are, to recall David Riesman, “inner directed”, and want to emerge from a private space with a solution of the Riemann hypothesis, and some of us are “other directed”, and just want to show up at a meeting with our advisor with a solution of his/her favorite problem. Also, there is the question of how should a research problem be ideally chosen, say by a master, versus the question of how should the modestly gifted among us actually proceed, given our limitations. Thus even if one does hope to enter into research on a significant problem as soon as possible after tools begin to exist for its attack, only a select group of people may realize when this occurs. So for this it is beneficial to maintain contact with the words and writings of those leaders who have command of the field one works in. It also helps if they are conversant with pregnant but little known literature, such as the papers of K. Petri, shown to me in the late 1960’s by my first advisor Alan Mayer, or the book of Wirtinger on Theta functions revealed to me by my second advisor C.H. Clemens. After being launched by these generous gifts, an opportunity occurred again during a research postdoctorate at Harvard, privileged to be among the giants: Mumford, Griffiths, Hironaka, Mazur, Kazhdan, Bott, Zariski, a fabulous group of students: Bob Friedman, Joe Harris, Ron Donagi, Dave Morrison, Ziv Ran, Rick Miranda,.... and the many other stars who came there - Igusa, Fay, Teissier, Freitag, Tai, Siu, Ramanan, ..... To take advantage of this opportunity, I moved my family to Cambridge and lived on an NSF stipend so small I sold my car the first year for food, and had to decline the second year entirely. So you could say that to pursue excellent current problems from a privileged perspective as a young researcher, I embraced temporary poverty. The benefit was a seat at the theater to which the most active players in my field came to present their latest work. At this point it was very stimulating to try to answer any question whose answer was interesting to one of my mentors but unknown to them. Those comments are from/for someone of average ability trying to compete for early progress on problems that are of wide spread interest and that may bring notoriety. Fortunately, as much or more satisfaction is found by working on problems that just appeal to our imagination, and that match our own expertise. At this later stage we are moving away from dependence on experts, to instruct us and supply us with topics and ideas, and are beginning to follow our own interests. So here one begins to acquire some expertise oneself, from study and independent work. It then begins to be ones own responsibility to maintain up to date awareness of the progress of others and to try to apply it to questions that appear of interest. It seems crucial here to attend talks by the best workers and to read their works. At this point one reaches the mystical stage of being able to predict what the answer to a question will likely be, before one has solved it. One may even attempt to compete with recognized experts on the same problems. Success however will depend on more than good intuition, but also on mastery of technical tools to complete the work. Some very strong individuals work more privately and still attack more public problems. I recall William Fulton saying he wanted to try to understand Schubert’s work on enumerative geometry, so he started reading it and filling details, but I don’t recall how much the fact it was a Hilbert problem influenced him, if at all. My colleague Bob Rumely was attracted to a Hilbert problem on finding procedures for solving integer equations, and tweaked it brilliantly to arithmetic integers. So another problem - finding technique is to take a well known one, solved or unsolved, and modify it intelligently. The third stage it seems to me, is having such a wide awareness of the state and likely development of a field or area, that one sees likely problems on every hand and invites new talent to work on them. If one succeeds here, one may create a team and an environment of creative research that feeds on itself, and all the players may learn to add to the palette of interesting problems. By the way, I would very much like to read accounts from some of the participants here of how they found a few of their favorite research problems. Going out on a limb here, I suspect a strong element of randomness will be noted. 

Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question
