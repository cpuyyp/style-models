Privacy is necessary to protect ourselves from imperfection People have been wondering throughout history if society wouldn't be better off with forced honesty, forced openess, no secrets, no privacy, just pure truth. Such a world would be a great place to live — if we were perfect. The problem is, we mere mortals are not. I've a police officer for a friend and once we debated the value of an excited utterance. In his world, an excited utterance is more honest, more truthful, because the speaker is unable to lie, unable to filter the facts. From my perspective, much of our world is accurately expressed because we filter the facts. Is a white person who spoke kindly of blacks and treated them fairly, with respect as equals, throughout their life suddenly telling the truth because when they hit their finger with a hammer they called the hammer a "cotton-picker!" Such is the case with my own father, who grew up in a racist household 60+ years ago, is not racist himself, but in those rare moments his childhood exerts itself. He's not lying when his filters are on, he's practicing the skills of a better person, skills learned through a lifetime of effort to make the world a better place. An open world would as quickly punish him for his imperfections as praise him for his improvement because compassion and empathy are frequently learned traits themselves. What, then, is the truth? What does it mean to be honest? Or, in short, Does this dress make me look fat? A smoothly operating society lives on the need to keep some ideas, some thoughts and attitudes private. Those thoughts may reflect the very complicated nature of an individual's past, but they do not reflect who the person is or wants to be (an issue, itself, that is very complex). We literally survive because of our ability to suppress undesirable, selfish, and conceited attitudes. And yet we have very popular reality shows that thrive on exposing the base, uncontrolled thoughts and desires of others. "Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down," croons songwriter Don Henley, "kick 'em all around." We can't handle what little "truth" is available to us now. The argument is: we would actually change if all that was forced to the open But that's a lie (and one of the biggest I've ever heard). A person spends his or her lifetime learning how to mould themselves into a good person. They learn skills for communication and discipline that they would not learn if forced to have every thought out in the open. The idea that society can force people to be good is, frankly, laughable. And if high school anywhere in the world isn't proof enough of that fact, then let's consider the prison system (anywhere in the world). Prisons do not produce model citizens. At best they produce model prisoners — people who have learned to work the system rather than learned how to behave in polite society. Forcing people to change rarely works. There is a considerable amount of evidence that your average prisoner returns to the lifestyle they had before prison. It's not that they can't be taught better. It's that inside of prison there's no space to learn to be better. You can't force a person to be better. Conclusion The effects on society would be devestating because people would have no way to improve themselves — but they would have the perfect way to dish out on other people's imperfections. I can easily imagine suicides skyrocketing and hate becoming the common norm. People would quickly flock to groups that accepted their now unhidable thoughts rather than working together to become better people overall. It would reek. And I'm ignoring things like everybody knowing everybody else's locker combinations. 

You are incorrect that you can reduce everything's operating voltage to create a Shangri-La of non-sparking power consumption. Lighting is a good example. You can light a small space adequately with a few volts, but a large space requires hundreds, even thousands of volts, to generate the number of required photons. Remember, LEDs are very good at producing a few high-energy photons. That's why they're great for street signals and brake lights. They're (still) lousy at producing a lot of low-energy photons, which is what ambient lighting requires. Room-filling LED lights require more than 5V. Then there's anything that requires a motor of any kind. You can dump (figuratively) all the current you want into a low-voltage motor and the torque will be so low you can stop it with your hand. More voltage, more torque, more ability to move the car, vacuum the floor, mill the metal, etc. And that's assuming that your power distribution isn't designed to move large amounts of power around at high voltages. The reason long-distance power lines use hundreds of thousands of volts is that it minimizes power loss and the amount of wire needed to carry the amps (Power = Current(amps) x Voltage(volts)). The display on your captain's armrest may require only 5V @ 2A to operate, but all the displays and all the controls on the bridge would need 5V @ 100's or 1,000's A. Suddenly it might make sense to trunk the energy into the bridge at 10,000 volts, thereby reducing current to 0.01's to 0.001's amps and a serious reduction in wire size. And you'd also get sparks. 

And though students of chemistry and the very Angels in Heaven are probably weeping over this answer (or laughing, it might be hard to tell the difference with all the tears), I give you my favored candidate: Fluorine 

If your intrepid crew's descendants haven't experienced at least tens to hundreds of thousands of years, then their location has nothing to do with their skin color. The politics and social mores of the society that launched them into space would have everything (as in 100%) to do with skin color. 

Your alternate history is very plausible because most people don't really think about the key product that changed all our lives: transistor radios Those of us who lived through the late 60s to mid 70s remember transistor radios. They were amazing! A radio you could hold in one hand, that ran for a decent amount of time on a battery! You can make a lot of arguments about how history transpired, but most technology is only created in a laboratory. It's develpped due to need. And need comes in many packages. The military needed a fast way to compute artillery trajectories (ballistics). That drove early computation (aka, computers). But that didn't drive the fundamental technology behind modern digital computers. Transistor radios did. And the need was commercialism. The bipolar transistor came along at a time when vacuum tube technology was stagnating and once people started buying the little bounders in the bazillions... vacuum tubes were dropped like yesterday's used underwear. So, rather than figuring out a way to remove semiconductors from history (which is impossible), let's change the order of how things happened and relegate digital computing to the backwater that analog computing enjoys today. The path we're replacing is this: 

You're using "quantum computer" as if it is something that will replace today's computers. It's much more accurate to suggest that "quantum processing" will replace today's CPUs and memory (and even that's not entirely accurate). Have you noticed that over the last 20 years the computational power of computers has grown to breathtaking proportions, but the physical box containing the "computer" hasn't changed all that much? You will still need a power supply, cooling, mass storage, and a means of connecting to input and output devices. The needs of interfacing with the human and storing information have always taken up the vast majority of volume represented by a "computer." I expect that mass storage will be dramatically improved with quantum technology... but our habit is to make the dang hard drive bigger so the price point stays the same. (Besides, tomorrow's games will always need more storage space than today's games.) But the human interface part... the com ports and interace electronics that connect keyboards, mice, pads, monitors, printers, etc., it shrinks, but the needs will always exist, and they don't benefit from quantum technology. (I can easily believe the keyboard will only disappear after we create direct mind-to-computer interfaces, but that's just my opinion). So, when you ask how small a "quantum computer" can be, the answer is "basically as small as we can build any other computer" because the only things likely to change are the CPU and memory — and we'll always want those to be bigger, better, and faster. 

Is this realistic? To be honest, in real life you probably need 10X this number of people... but I can't prove it without spending 10X the time to analyze the situation. 

Yes and no. This is actually a really cool question due in no small part to my facination with how people internalize philosophy. To begin with, we need to consider the different types of foundational beliefs (and I'll include some "non-realistic" just for fun). BACKGROUND INFORMATION: SKIP TO TL:DR IF YOU JUST WANT THE ANSWER 

Anywhere a planet can orbit with stability, an asteroid belt can orbit with stability. Depending on the orbital inclination, the effect would vary from drawing a line across the sun to having a thin "halo" around some or all of the sun (not that I've ever heard of an incination of 90 degrees, but that doesn't mean it's not possible. That effect would change as your planet orbits around the star. You might want to research how we see Saturn's rings as the two orbits move, the effect would be similar. As for eclipses, the "halo" (if it exists due to inclination) would be more pronounced. Like looking at a dude with an old "arrow through his head" gag but the face is blacked out. 

Your Last Problems: Metal, Wood, and Coal Finally, a floating island will have little in the way of mining or logging. You'd need a floating state to have enough forest to be self-sustaining with wood, and even if you created a big enough floating island to have mining, it's a finite resource. You need to move metal and wood to your island, exacerbating the transport problem because they're both heavy. On top of that is the need for heat for everything from comfort to cooking to metalworking. I'm assuming coal for convenience. And that's assuming you're not building your fortress/castle out of stone. Granted, after it's built all you need is maintenance... but rocks are heavy.
