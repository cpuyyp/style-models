The question sounds like the woman is alleged to have lifted a 1.5 ton weight into the air, like a weight-lifter. Her claim is much more mundane - that she was able to shove the weight in a way that relieved the pressure from her father, and enabled him to be rescued. 

They offered water at a range of temperatures to some people dehydrated through sweating or mountain climbing, measured how much they drank, and asked what they preferred. The subjects rated the coldest water as more pleasurable, but drank more when they drank it at 15째C. If given the opportunity to mix the water to a drinkable temperature, they also chose 14.9째C. This contradiction between drinking the most at 15째C but rating 0째C as more pleasurable was attributed to the volunteers being too hot as well as dehydrated: 

Hat tip to @adam-phelps for two of those images. Evidence that the manufacturer is Marius Kids/Ugly Children's Clothing comes from: 

Conclusions This crap hits a trigger button for me, and makes me angry. Giving people false information about life decisions that kill 100,000 people a year is obnoxious, callous and unethical. Even if you assume the inverse relationship between obesity and smoking is causal, smoking to prevent obesity is putting you in a higher-risk category, and so is counter-productive. Smoking to prevent diabetes is even more nuts. It doesn't reduce the risk, it is associated with a higher risk. First, give up the cigarettes. Then, work on your weight. Then, work out how we can retain freedom of speech and yet get guys like this to shut up. 

TL;DR Geller's skills could be performed by a competent magician. There is no good evidence that he uses paranormal means, and evidence that at least some of the time he cheats, so the simplest explanation is that he is a competent magician. 

I can't resist adding that about 20 years ago I was commissioned by Roger Prebble (then managing editor of a major UK puzzle publishing company) to write crossword-generating software. He'd previously compiled a number of "word list" books published by Chambers, and as a goodwill gesture they'd allowed him free use of an electronic copy of Official Scrabble Words (UK rights to which they owned at the time). Roger initially thought that being able to incorporate the OSW list into my program would be a major help. In the event, we soon realised that most of the words were so obscure they could never be used. He and a few others with exceptionally wide vocabularies had to spend many, many hours leafing through the list deleting anything they'd never heard of. Even of the 80,000 that remained after this savage cull, more than half were flagged as "very difficult", and not to be used by my program for "ordinary" puzzles. As far as I recall, we only marked about 10,000 as "well-known enough to be used in any crossword puzzle". Just to put some context on that, bear in mind that most people who do crosswords at any level probably tend to have at least an "average" vocabulary, or they'd soon get frustrated and give up the pastime. 

Is it realistic to suppose an alien civilisation 60 light-years away could now be receiving tv transmissions of "I Love Lucy"? This site says emphatically not, but my brother say ET could easily do it if he wanted to. Please settle the argument, somebody! ADDED 11th July: Just to clarify, my brother is prepared to assume ET's detection facilities could be incredibly good (i.e. - receiver array as wide as a planet or larger, focussed exactly on the earth), and almost infinite processing power to separate signal from noise. In short, the question comes down to whether there's some upper limit on how close ET would need to be, before 'background noise' would overwhelm any feasible attempt at detection. I don't know enough about information theory to even know whether such a limit can be proven to exist, let alone whether it can be calculated to an actual value. 

I interpret the claim to mean that a chemical bleach (e.g. sodium hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide) is added to the salt during the refining process to whiten the contaminants. Is that true? 

This is a movie and police-procedural TV-show cliche that we all know: The police captain (or insert-your-favourite-law-enforcement-officer) realises he (I can't recall it ever being a she.) has a "situation" involving bad guys inside a building that he needs to get out. He shouts: "Somebody get me the plans to this building!". Minutes later the cops are spreading out the blueprints on the bonnet of the car to find the best entry point. The Bourne Ultimatum is a random example: 

This is not evidence that it never happens - anecdotes would counter that - but merely that, as of 2008, it wasn't a common occurrence and wasn't a recommended practice. 

Heineken have addressed this rumour years ago, explaining that they did not sponsor the event, and have ceased their relationship with the venue: 

They conclude that these findings are NOT enough to conclude that talcum powder causes ovarian cancer: 

NO, Egale is not calling for such changes to the law. The LifeSiteNews article links to the Egale final report. After some discussion, the recommendations appear on page 43. 

An experiment was performed that showed that people don't think faster, but do have a perception that time runs slower. The experiment was reported in Not Exactly Rocket Science, a blog associated with Discover Magazine. 

I found the following articles from any source at all recommending you not wash your vegetables to preserve nutrients: 

I have been unable to find papers that make an estimate of the total amount of time required for the complete evolution from the LUA. However, I can cite a couple of important papers which show that some of the more complicated steps can be achieved in timescales that are relatively short. The 1994 paper, (A Pessimistic Estimate of the Time Required for an Eye to Evolve* looks at an area which has been commonly cited as one of the biggest challenges to Evolution - the evolution of the eye. (Ironically, Darwin himself was one of the first people to raise this issue, and one of the first to propose an answer.) They theoretically estimate how many generations would be required for an eye to evolve - not from an LUA, but from a patch of skin that is light-sensitive. They conclude 

As others have pointed out, birds certainly wouldn't be likely to use their sense of smell to identify and reject a replaced fledgling. Luckily for cuckoos! As a general principle you shouldn't interfere with the natural process. That fledgling may be defective in some way. Maybe it's too stupid or too adventurous to stay safely in the nest. Maybe it's diseased and the parent recognises this in some way. This link might not put the position as strongly as I would, but it leans in the same direction. It doesn't really matter. The point is if you save that potentially unfit animal, it may grow up and mate. Possibly leading to more defectives that otherwise wouldn't have been born. Possibly depriving some other fit bird from getting the chance to mate. Nature got along fine for billions of years without human intervention, and much of the current evidence (such as Tire Reef and just about everything in New Zealand) suggests that when we do intervene, we often mess things up anyway. Grit your teeth and let Nature take its course. 

In The Runaway Brain by Christopher Wills, the author illustrates the fact that ostriches aren't too bright by saying that an ostrich has been recorded as getting tangled in the fork of a tree, panicking, and pulling off its own head. Is there any evidence to back this up? Is it even plausible? 

As others have said, much depends on your definition of "a word". The 250,000+ "words" in Collins Official Scrabble Words, probably represent a little over 100,000 "base words", with the rest accounted for by a small set of standard regular inflections. OSW doesn't include "uninflected" words of 10 letters or more - but although English includes a lot of these, they're mostly compound words that can be understood by deconstruction into meaningful sub-components. Sticking to "base words", my understanding is you only need about 3000 to get by in terms of being able to express yourself without great difficulty, but even relatively illiterate people probably have more than twice that number at their disposal, so you'd often have difficulty understanding others' speech or writing with such a poor vocabulary. I think the average person probably has a productive/expressive vocabulary (words they're likely to actually use) of 15-20,000 words, with a receptive/listening vocabulary (words they would understand, but not normally say/write) at least half as big again. 

If the question is "Do high school exam grades correlate with salary in China?", it is complicated. An interesting approach is taken by 

Now, the question remains: Are they really more sensitive, or is it more that their opinion of the smells that change (i.e. things smell better, worse or just subjectively stronger?) Well, the science is a little unclear: 

This is justified on the basis of "sleep hygiene" - the idea of training the mind to associate lying in bed with sleeping. That said, I speculate that for some insomniacs, having a set routine which involves lying down, shutting your eyes and ignoring some patternless noise from a phone, may actually serve as a higher-quality routine for sleep-hygiene that using the same phone to watch videos and answer questions on StackExchange web sites while lying in bed. Two other studies were of interest: 

I assume that is referring to large sheets and blankets and the like. In conclusion, any effect of snapping out the clothes is too small for the manufacturers to recommend in manuals that are otherwise filled with minutiae on improving the dryers' effectiveness. 

The Wikipedia page on Digit Ratio provides a good background and references dozens of studies divided up into areas such as physiology and disease, psychological disorders, physical and competitive behaviour, cognition and personality, management, sensory perception and sexual orientation. Some relevant results to personality to the question: 

Now the original claim referred to numbers from one to one hundred, not just one to nine. I haven't found research on that broad a range, but changing the range of the numbers was examined in this 1977 paper titled The "Blue Seven" Is Not A Phenomenon. [The title of the paper doesn't imply people don't pick blue and seven more frequently. It is that the people who pick blue aren't more likely to pick seven than the people who don't pick blue.] They looked at the range 2-12 (to mimick dice games):
