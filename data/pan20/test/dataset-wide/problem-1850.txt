Be honest, friendly, and direct. What you've said in your question is a good start: At the beginning you didn't have any objection, but as time has gone on you've realized it does affect you negatively. It's entirely possible that your co-worker has no idea you're bothered by his vaping, since you initially indicated it wasn't a problem. So I wouldn't be surprised if your co-worker were to be accommodating to your request. Think ahead of time what kind of compromise, if any, you would accept, so that you're not pressured into making an agreement that you'll have to walk back eventually. Try to keep it the resolution between yourselves as much as possible -- once you escalate, things can start to go south in terms of working relationships. 

I find that most situations can be solved by a frank discussion with the people involved seeking to find the best solution for all parties. With that said, have you informed this candidate that they have offensive body odor? If you have, and they have not changed*, then your critique need only say that the candidate does not follow instructions well. If you have not, then the issue is not with the candidate, it is with you. You have identified a problem and then failed to attempt to correct the problem. 

I'm keeping track of my own hours for the position I'm currently working at a small company. I have never had to keep track of my hours before, so I'm unsure about whether or not I should be exact in my report. For example, if I finished at 6:08 would it make sense to round it to 6:10? I'm afraid that if all of my numbers are rounded off, my employer may think I'm "cheating." A friend told me that it's actually how you are "supposed to do it," though. 

I don't think an accent in and of itself negatively affects job prospects. More important is your ability to make yourself understood to a majority of people. People can have very distinctive and pleasant accents, and still be able to communicate effectively. Others may have the same regional accent as you, but still cannot be easily understood, because they do not speak loudly or clearly enough. I believe one should have and practice a "business voice" for those occasions when important information needs to be verbally exchanged. That voice might be slower, louder, and employ more repetition, but it should be somewhat distinct from an everyday voice you might use informally with friends or family. It's also important when speaking to others to pick up on informal, non-verbal cues others make to indicate that they understand you. So I would embrace your accent, but make sure you're conscious of any words, phrases, or habits that might not make it easy for people to understand what you are saying. 

With body odor, and other personal issues, be very careful how you approach the subject. If you can, defer to HR or at least have a mediator. If you cannot, then be sure to bring up the topic privately and with compassion. No one is able to smell their own natural odor, because everyone normalizes to themselves. It may be that the candidate does not have a strong sense of smell. It may be that the candidate does not have access to facilities such as a shower. It may even be that they use too much of a particular perfume/cologne, and just need to change brands. If you don't know the exact details of their life, give them the benefit of the doubt. 

This is known as a group interview. According to at least one study they are increasing in popularity, but based on my experience I would say they are far from the norm, so it's understandable that you were surprised by this experience. Although there are clear disadvantages to this format, such as some people having more time to think about the same question, or when more outspoken/aggressive candidates dominate the time, those can be mitigated somewhat (e.g., asking each person a different question first). One benefit of the group interview is to demonstrate how people might interact in a collaborative setting, which is an important part of most positions in a company. This also adds some stress to the interview setting, which again can be part of any job. I have never been in a group interview, and not known anyone who has -- that's of course not the last word as to the popularity of group interviews, or the likelihood of being called to one, but my guess is this type of interview is still an outlier in the context of job searches. 

If the only thing wrong with this candidate is that they smell bad, then why waste a perfectly good opportunity over something so trivially solvable? * I had mistakenly assumed that anyone reading this would understand implicitly that the odor would have to be due to something that was within the candidate's control. However the comments I've received have made it clear that I need to be more explicit on this: If changing isn't an option, or simply didn't work, then go back to my first point by having a frank discussion with the people involved seeking to find the best solution for all parties; try something new and repeat until the problem is solved. 

I interviewed for a small company in San Francisco for a web development position. When I was asked what I was doing prior to the interview, I said I was "working as a freelance web developer." His response was: "but you would be willing to give that up if you got this job, right?" Do you think this is him indicating that he doesn't want me freelancing on the side? Now that I have the job, I find that I still have time to freelance beyond my normal daily tasks. Should I start freelancing? Do you think this would upset him? I would rather not speak to him about it considering I just started working here and I certainly don't want him to think my priorities are anywhere other than my full time job. 

Many are simply resistant to change, but that does not mean they are necessarily under-qualified. Seems like you've done what you can to get them up to speed on the new software, but at this point they have become dependent on you, and you are starting to enable their lack of knowledge. One thing that might help is to document what you've been showing them, and step away from doing their work for them. You can either create your own documentation, or pull content from the official documentation of the software itself. If they ask you how to do something, write it down. Then the next time they ask, you can point to the document, and continue doing your own work. This way you can demonstrate to a third party (say, your VP) how much you have done to try to help. Right now you don't have evidence to back up what you say is happening. The documentation will help if anyone in your department attempts to say that you are not helping, or tries to escalate this to upper management. There's no need for you to raise concerns to upper management yourself. Your work and attempts to help will speak for themselves.
