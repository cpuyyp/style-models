It's a stretch, but it's not totally crazy to think that an animal could produce a light pattern of rapidly shifting colors that could trigger a very specific sort of seizure which presents as immobility. That could also be turned on and off at will, as the pattern of lights and colors would need to actually be happening to have any effect. 

Absent it's supernatural qualities, I'd be pretty skeptical that something like this is literally possible. But as as science fiction element, there are plenty of examples of creatures that live in space. I wouldn't worry about plausibility, as you're likely past that right from the start. Ancient and unimaginably excellent design will do the trick, but will defy your efforts to explain the organism in much detail. And with its supernatural qualities you can just assert pretty much whatever properties you want, in which case plausibility is a non-issue. 

I'm not sure such an economy would work. To the extent that it might, that's probably going to be about social structure and values, not economics. I realize that may not be the most worldbuilding-esque answer, but as I see it your fundamental issue is that you've designed a system to be internally consistent (I assume, I'm not sure I understand the technical details fully) without much thought dedicated to how that system would interact with the actual world, or the people that would use it. Hence your question. So let's abstract away the technical details, at least to rough out how the economy might function. The process of producing qualia seems to only validate that they underlying experience actually happened (no fakes, at least by the standards of subjective experience), but otherwise doesn't establish any real market features of the currency. The overwhelmingly key question to be answered seems to me to be: 

I'd like to avoid retreading some very good points made earlier, but will enumerate the ones that jumped out at me as being very valid before going into what I feel is the biggest issue. In no particular order, humans have experience in the following: Technology usage and maintenance Communication and coordination of large scale endeavors Logistical networks to support military operations Air power Now, what I feel is really the most significant factor in the whole "Humans vs. Apes" scenario put forth is the simple fact that humans have been waging war for thousands of years and no other species on earth has even come close to the level of conflict that we engage in. Humans are amazing at fighting. We are an apex predator like no other. We are incredibly adaptable, and have all the most terrifyingly dangerous elements of both predators and prey. We have developed and employed weapons and tactics for every conceivable scenario throughout our history. We are able to plan for and carry out very sophisticated operations, and cooperate to accomplish them in ways that apes would need years if not generations to begin to recognize, even assuming they were intellectually capable of doing so. In my in-expert opinion, apes simply lack the military instinct that seems to distinguish humanity. Apes may fight and quarrel, but that is the equivalent of schoolyard fistfights compared to the level of military sophistication that has been demonstrated by human armies since antiquity. 

Given the overwhelming similarity of most day-to-day experiences (unless you've got some wild social/experiential setup), the passive accumulation of experience likely wouldn't be worth much. Especially if qualia cannot be destroyed, inflation should quickly drive the relative value of most individual qualia to virtually nothing. Most people will be poor by dint of the commonness of their life experience. 

This is similar to the above. If we're talking about forming your own identity or dealing in rarity, then maybe. Otherwise, a lot of daily experience seems like it would be valued as trash. tl;dr: As laid out, I don't see why people would use qualia as currency if they had other options, as the subjective value of different experiences would leave qualia with wildly diverging values. It would be more like a bartering system than a currency. Answering the question of why people would choose to use qualia will set the stage for the actual use of the currency. If you're set on this system, the society in which it operates will have to be molded to fit, and that involves arbitrary choices on your part. 

1. Written records are extremely holy, reserved for the holy texts alone Learning to read is restricted to scholars of the holy texts, and is seen as blasphemy if used for other uses. This will heavily gimp any attempts to conduct experiments or gather research. Libraries are straight out. Oral recitation/memorization is the only way to pass information along. Note that this will hamper pretty much all forms of research, not just mechanical technology. Think legal, civic, philosophical, pretty much every area of possible human knowledge will be limited to that which can be learned and remembered in a human lifespan. Apprenticeships will become the pinnacle of human education, and mastering skills beyond a single craft-related area is going to be quite uncommon. Comments pointed out that it also has the neat effect of restricting accounting/trade to basically what you can count in your head and remember, which means that capitalism (and thus corporations that might invest in research) also never happens. 2. To question the natural order is blasphemy Asking questions about the world around you is a sure sign of heresy, and punishable by death. Essentially, forbid attempts to experiment with or alter things in general. This could be enforced by a general culture that frowns on any sort of curiosity, and quickly punishes people who change or question established norms. Fear of the unknown, the opposite of scientific curiosity that leads to discovery, would come to dominate people's thinking and curtail technological advances. 3. Strive always to match the labors of thy father/mother Rather than forbidding people from seeking new experiences, promote the continual pursuit of some ancestral standard of excellence (in a twisted sort of Greco-Roman ideal). Perhaps this is the path to salvation, to continually strive towards the simple and fulfilling life that was practiced for generations before you. The idea here is to have commandments which do not explicitly forbid the things that they are trying to prevent (i.e. scientific experimentation) but instead to shape a general culture that is unwilling to try new things or to step too far away from the familiar comforts of the lifestyle of their parents. If something is specifically forbidden, it is basically an invitation for heretics to engage in that behavior, which could almost have the opposite of the desired effect (i.e. mixing metals, forming educational institutions might give them those ideas immediately). Whereas, if the behaviors forbidden don't really seem that enticing (who wants to have to sit in class and learn to write? You don't want to be a priest do you?) or the behaviors are discouraged in an indirect manner, this system will have much greater overall longevity. Look to the world of Dune for some inspiration on how despite a ban on mechanical computation devices, or AI of any kind, spacefaring society still managed to make certain developments and work around imposed religious limitations. 

That said, here is how I think humans would adapt: Daytime would be mostly work time, with catnaps interspersed through at the light hours. I would tend to believe that there would be easily accessible bunks in work places for people to go at naptime. Nighttime would most likely be the opposite. If we assume there would be 16 hours of darkness, I would guess that at least half of it would be spent sleeping, probably in 2 chunks. Maybe 4 hours of sleep, 8 hours of fun-time followed by another 4 hours of sleep before getting back to the daily grind. 

okay here's what I would suggest, create a calendar for your first area Day 1 of month 1 is the first day that the flames should be hitting the area Last day of month 1 is the day that the storm has moves on So the days in which the flames are coming back will be the end of the year. Divide up the rest of the year into months of the same size as the first, or smaller units if you need. For the sake of simplicity, I'll use a 30 day month, with 12 months. So "January" would be the fire days. Then you can map out what should happen in that area each month. Trees start growing back in month 3, should be a foot tall in month 4, 6 feet in month 10 etc. This can also be translated into distance and movement. At 3 months, the fire is 1/4 away around the world. For the purposes of travel, characters who travel 1/4 of the way around the world, would have their calendars turned back 3 months. If you keep track of how much time passes, and where they are, you should always be able to determine where the fire is and what is happening where they are right now. 

Something which wasn't addressed in other answers with regard to the ammunition is that over time it has a tendency to "settle". The propellant will slowly compress on the bottom, so properly stored ammunition is rotated every so often (1-3 times annually) to prevent this. Storing ammunition reliably for a long period of time is quite tricky, and generally requires monitoring and effort. It's possible that storing it vertically (i.e. base down and bullet up) would mitigate this effect, although I have no knowledge or experience of how that would affect the viability of the round WRT the propellant. 

The scale of the model in your image is not very realistic. At that size, it is more efficient to have two rotors, like the V-22 Osprey. In order for four rotors to be feasible, you would need a much larger body of aircraft, so that the four rotors are required for stabilization. I am not an aeronatical engineer, but I suspect that the reason drones use quad rotors is that they are more concerned with stability and ease of piloting than efficient weight:thrust ratios. A heavy cargo plane with four rotors would be pretty cool, if there was a sensible in-universe justification for wanting a VTO/L version of the C-5 Galaxy. 

If people are essentially trading experiences, would one person care about having the experience itself (a lot would be essentially duplicates, at least in any meaningful way. How many bowls of soup would a person want a record of eating?)? In at least some cases the experience would be rare and interesting, but the vast majority would be minor variations on common experiences. Because of this it seems clear that there would be no fixed value to a quale. In this case supply and demand forces would be odd, because an original core experience would be much more valuable than a common one, and the validation mechanisms shouldn't be able to enforce a common value of any individual quale. Would some people try to monopolize experiences of a given type, and sell them at exorbitant prices? Would there be a thriving rental market? Do people lose qualia in a transaction, in exchange for something new? If so, how would peoples' identities handle the constant shifting of remembered experiences? Would they cling to their own subjective ones, regardless of market value (like remembering the birth of your child, or an intimate moment with a loved one)? Would people work in exchange for customizing their remembered experiences, essentially valuing the person they want to be vastly more than the "balance" of qualia in their accounts? And, importantly, if the qualia are intrinsically valuable, how does the market react to inflation? Can my subjective experience of a quale on Tuesday be traded to you on Wednseday, generating a new "echo" quale of your experience of my experience? What would the value relative to the original be like? Could it be more valuable, if something about my own experience is different, adding to the original experience? Can people assess the quality of a quale before completing a transaction? If not, what opportunities for fraud and deception exist, and what mechanisms exist for protecting against them? As time passes, even rare qualia will be more or less duplicated, diluting their value. I imagine there would be a major drive in society to mint original qualia, riding ahead of a wave of ever-inflating and ever-less-valuable existing qualia and their derivatives. How easily can meaningfully novel qualia be produced, and how much ability does the average person have to produce them? Relating the value of qualia to physical goods or services also seems hard. How many experiences, and of what type, would a farmer be willing to trade for a discrete, physical potato? If the amount of meaningfully distinct experiences is relatively fixed, at what point does a farmer have enough experiences to not be willing to engage in further transactions in exchange for production of physical food? If the qualia are simply tokens of exchange, you retain the issues of varying quale value but don't have to deal with the identity crises. It becomes essentially a fiat currency, but one that would probably experience ever-increasing devaluation. As tokens, you can hand-wave away a lot of implementation details (why do we use qualia? Well, if you want to buy something, that's what you have to spend. The rationale isn't so important when you need to buy groceries). In thinking about these questions, a couple of your goals for the currency seem to be shaky to me. I'm not convinced that qualia can be: 

Sleep is strongly affected by light. The presence of light inhibits the production of melatonin, darkness encourages it. Sleeping during the day light hours would require a lot of shade. Staying awake during the dark hours would require good lighting and an extra pot of coffee. Human beings do not NEED to have all of their sleep in one stretch. Thomas Edison famously power napped instead of sleeping all at once. Ultimately REM sleep is cumulative, and if you get enough of it, it doesn't matter how you do it. 

The main reason I would see the planet moving to a light based power source would be some quantum leap forward in the technology. That is, someone has to invent the technology first, and it must be widely regarding as awesome. It must be powerful enough to take on their current energy needs. Most importantly, it MUST be cheap. In order everyone to abandon fossil fuels, this option must be super cheap to implement. There will be very rich and powerful people trying to fight its adoption. To counter those people, the cost must be such that it can be put into place and there is an immediate savings. There are certainly a ton of benefits to this type of power, but the motivating factor would be cost. For interstellar travel I would recommend looking at Solar Sails. Solar pressure pushes on large mirrors to propel the spacecraft. The interplanetary version of this is already being used, so it just needs to be upgraded with some better technology. The hypothetical interstellar version could be powered by high intensity lasers. I highly recommend reading the Wikipedia article! What is the down side to the light based power source? Is there a side effect? My first concern would if there were health consequences to the power source? Do the new power companies need to rip open the ozone layer to get better and more lucrative? Imagine that there are still plenty of ways for energy cartels to develop and exploit the system in an attempt to make more money. (Avarice is always a good motive.) Is energy distributed fairly across the masses? I hate to just recommend the classic conflict of the haves vs the havenots, but I see this world as having larger and larger skyscrapers, reaching closer to the light source. At the same time, the people down on street level are literally stuck in their shadows, getting very little light. 

It's fairly simple. Just have political ideologies evolve along different lines than they did in our history. Technology may progress in a similar fashion, and corporations could even develop (think East India Company instead of Apple or Ford). The thing that drove Monarchs out of business was the set of ideas promulgated by thinkers like John Locke et al. These drove the American and French Revolutions, and later the revolutions of 1848. Now, it's not so simple as a linear correlation between those ideas and the fall of monarchies, but it certainly influenced the direction that they toppled in, so to speak. Economic stagnation will usually lead to political upheaval, and the revolutionaries were there with their new ideas to fill the void in the late 18th century. However, there is plenty of room throughout human history for scientific progress that is compatible with aristocratic pomp and circumstance. For example, look at the Northern Rennaissance in Europe as contrasted with the Italian Rennaissance. Two different political environments both undergoing rapid adoption of the scientific method and artistic creativity. Simply have your society of aliens develop political philosophies more based on those of Plato and Thomas Hobbes than those of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson.
