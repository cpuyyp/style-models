This is a question better asked on Security Stackexchange than here, but let me give it a shot. First, the safety of handing over this kind of information is highly contingent on how much you trust this recruiter. Is this a person you basically have exchanged emails or talked on a phone a few times? If so, this is similar to handing over this information to a person on the street. Can you be certain this supposed recruiter isn't going to use this information for identity theft? Or even if this recruiter isn't an identity thief, given the lack of concern this person seems to have about your privacy, can you be sure that this recruiter doesn't just leave this information in some online email account guarded with the password "password"? Note that while a passport number is not usually (at least in the US) used as part of identity verification except by certain governmental agencies, your passport does contain AFAIK the date of birth and possibly other identifying information that is used commonly on the Internet for identification purposes. It is not at all safe to give the last digits of your Social Security Number. It is used as part of identity verification for various government websites and even for some corporate websites, e.g. insurance, banking, or credit cards (see this site for more detailed info). This is no longer 1995. Most people are aware of identity theft and that SSNs are a security weakness. The recruiter is either ignorant or not very respectful of your privacy. Either way, I would not want to continue working with such a person. The thing that raises suspicion is that this should all be part of the background check later. If the recruiter is legit, then the recruiter doesn't really trust you (or his/her candidates in general). I would not want to continue a working relationship with a person that clearly distrusts me from the start. 

As said in multiple answers, it is a bad idea to ask for a significantly lower salary. However, this is not true in two cases which have not been mentioned: start-ups and consulting companies. A start-up has often a (very) limited budget so it needs to save money, or simply cannot afford your market price. If your price is too high they'll pick without demur another candidate, less skilled but cheaper. For consulting companies, their revenue comes from the difference between what they get from the client and what they pay to the consultant. I've had my fair share of experiences with some that weren't much interested in the quality of the candidate and just wanted to go for the cheaper hire in order to maximize their profits. There are a few cases in which such a job can be worth pursuing, for instance to gain some experience, or to get out of an unemployment period while looking for a better job; just be forewarned that they're going to exploit you. 

A verbal offer has no meaning unless it's followed by a written contract shortly afterwards. In your case, the delay has largely expired. They're just wasting your time and playing with you by having you wait for so long. You have nothing in hand so far and it's very likely that this offer will never became real so I would advise you to take the other offer, even if it's not your dream job. It already happened me a couple of times in which my manager told me "yeah, we are going to renew your contract" (one time even he gave his word for it), with nothing in writing. To imagine how it ended is left as an exercise to the reader. 

There are probably things here you aren't aware of, as a new employee. Reaching out to her perceived competitors/enemies is not a great suggestion to make. Maybe she's paranoid, or maybe they really are all out to get her. Who knows. You might as well give her benefit of the doubt for now. I'm not saying this is the case, but for all you know, your entire department is constantly under threat of being absorbed into the departments of the people you want to ask for help from. There are many plausible scenarios for her behavior. As you said, she has been there for 40 years. Maybe she knows something you don't. My opinion is that there really is only one negative from what you said. Yes, it is a big one, and only you can make the call, but from what you said, you really like the company and your work -- realize that's something not many people have. 

This is extremely minor. She has around 20 years on you and is at the "senior citizen"/elder level in society. 

This is somewhat major. I don't know anybody that likes being yelled at by their boss in front of everyone. It would seem this has been her style for a number of years, so I don't see a way you can change this. Just put it on your list of "cons" of the job. 

The problem is: how do you optimize the number that everyone will agree upon? Consider that the only disadvantage to naming an unrealistically high number is that you either appear insane/not worth dealing with or that the other side can't find common ground to negotiate on (no point in negotiating with someone who says, "give me one billion dollars just BECAUSE.") So there is nothing wrong with giving a number first, as long as you give them a way to negotiate with you and they feel you are dealing fairly with them. People frequently involved in negotiations hear bizarre reasoning all the time. They deal with otherwise intelligent people who have stupid reasons for the prices they demand (just a little watching of "Shark Tank" should convince you of this). This means there is no point in appearing to be a smart negotiator. In fact, there is advantage in looking like a chump, as long as you don't appear so dumb you won't take their best offer. Collect all relevant salary info, as much as you can, from as varied sources as you can. Anything related to the responsibilities of the job and anything related to someone of your background. Remember you are going to need to explain this in some semi-coherent (but not necessarily intelligent) manner during negotation, so you should take some notes on the details. Then throw out all the lower salaries and leave the very highest. Take the average of this. This should be higher than any number you could possibly have hoped for. Add some wiggle room based on the variance of the entire sample. Or hell, depending on what you find reasonable, just increase this amount by some arbitrary amount that has some meaning to you, like the cost of your ideal vacation. Find a way to fix the data sample to justify this increase. (Later, you can reduce your ask by a similar amount, if they make it up with some generous vacation policy or something -- see where this is going?) Now that you have rigged your sample data to have more than enough justification for the well-meaning chump you are going to represent yourself as, you are ready. When you are asked to give that number, give it to them by first stating, "I believe the market value of an above average (insert position title) is $$$. Due to my experience in (attributes/skills semi-fitting your background), I believe my number of $$$ - (smallish arbitrary number) is more than reasonable; however I understand you might not agree or this may not be within your budget. Please let me know either way and I'm happy to discuss." The point is to appear like you put some thought into it and that the number is based on some reasoning that you are willing to adjust. Now the discussion is on your terms. They are going to have to argue you down, and the result is going to largely be a result of your negotiation skills. But that's a good start. 

It is perfectly polite to ask for him to do that. Unfortunately, as others have already said, your request wasn't worded as well as it could have been and it did come across as if you were asking for their email. That's not necessarily a faux pas, but it's reasonable for him to have declined your (perceived) request. But what's done is done. There's no use now in agonising over the wording or the level of ambiguity in what you said (as some other users seem to be doing). What I would do now is send a very short email just to clarify. Something like: 

I don't think this is rude at all. It seems like an honest attempt to assess what you know. As for the fact it happened with every question, perhaps you were misinterpreting his questions, or you went off on a tangent, or maybe the two of you were just on a different wavelength. If he actually thought your answers were bad or that you didn't know the answer, he wouldn't bother to rephrase. It would be a waste of time for both of you. 

You make it sound as if you think you're the most qualified for the position simply because you're older than everyone else. In my experience, senior developers tend to think this is true significantly more often than it actually is. Clearly, I don't have enough information to say whether this is true in your case but it's something to consider. 

The fact that you used the "spoiler tag" in your post to hide the content of your bumper sticker already says that you think it is (or might be considered) inappropriate. Whether your employer has the right or not of forbidding this kind of stickers is, IMHO, not the point. The point is whether you want to be a nice employee or you want to be pointed out as the one who picks fights at every opportunity. The best outcome for you (if you want to keep working there in a nice environment -- or, bluntly said, if you want to keep working there) would be to apologize, tell you employer you didn't realize it was so offensive, and rip the sticker off your car. 

In my city there's this large company employing several thousand people, at which I've already worked before during a small period, and where I'd really like to be employed again for a number of reasons. Since it's a renowned place, it attracts between 300 and 600 applicants for every single job opening they post. I've quite good qualifications and experience, and I've been applying for a large number of jobs there in the last ten years (*). I've mixed feeling as whether I should mention this in my job applications, or it would be better to leave it out, and whether it would make any difference. Would that sound as very motivated to work at the company (making me stand out among the other candidates), or just as desperate/pathetic? (*) So far I managed just to obtain a 1-year contract, long time ago. 

It sounds like a reasonable thing to ask but I'd expect they're only going to tell you what you want to hear. Remember as much as you're selling yourself in the interview, they're also selling the job to you. They have a somewhat vested interest to lie emphasise the positive aspects. "Of course we're accepting of transgender people" - no reasonable professional person would say anything else, regardless of their personal feelings. Perhaps the best way to get the answer you're looking for is to ask them to show, don't tell. "What support do you have available to LGBT staff? What's your policy on discrimination or workplace bullying?". These are questions with concrete answers. You can't BS your way through them. As with a lot of aspects of a new job, it can unfortunately be difficult to get a true sense of the place until you're actually there. I don't think it applies to you, but you should always try to use any contacts you may have within the company to get an unbiased opinion - a friend, a friend-of-a-friend, an ex-colleague. If there's no one like that, you just have to try your best to get a feel for the company. Perhaps a start-up is more likely to have a younger, more liberal, more progressive view of your gender identity. Perhaps a larger, more corporate place may have more structured support available. Good luck at the new place and with your transition. I hope it all works out well.
