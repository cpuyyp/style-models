Let me say it outright from the start: you can't get a $10 \times R_\oplus$ radius world to be inhabitable by anything resembling humans. Before you despair, let me remind you that planetary surface increases with the square of the radius, and Earth is huge to begin with: 510 million square kilometers. So for twice the radius, you get 2.04 billion square km, and for three times the radius, you get 4.5 billion square km, nearly 10 times larger! Imagine how different history would have been had the Earth been that large. The larger surface area might mean slower days with longer nights, or perhaps faster orbital rotation. The terror of the night would be prolonged, or storms might be more massive than anything we know here on Earth. The vast oceans would regulate and moderate climate more than on Earth with their vast heat capacity, while waves might build up over the ocean vasts to truly astonishing heights (100m or more). The atmosphere itself would likely be deeper and denser, and given the higher planetary mass, retain more of the primordial gases. So how do you get such a thing? The most likely process would be to start from a Chthonian planet, have it drift away from the star and rebuild some of the atmosphere from comets and eruptions. 

Technological progress is driven from marginal investments at the technological possibilities frontier. In a theocracy as anywhere else, the key issue holding up progress is not theology but the perverse incentive systems riddling any bureaucratic organization - be it a company, a world government or a church: the people in power like the status-quo, and any change to the status-quo can become a threat to their power, so they do not have a strong incentive to take risks and try new things: 

Say we have a rich, rich society, where due to scientific advances, a generous socialist-bent government willing to tax the rich at 75% and patriotic citizens mysteriously willing to pay said taxes, it becomes possible to genetically modify the entire next generation to predispose them towards being kind, good-looking and frighteningly intelligent. I'm not saying violence would be eradicated once the natural generations die out, but rather (at least according to the pre-implementation vision of the planners) it might be reduced to maybe 1% of its previous level; while most people would be able to eat ice-cream all day (if for some reason they wanted to) and yet maintain a slender, healthy figure; and in terms of intelligence, the average 10 year old would be able to pass our current university exams with ease (not that they would be interested in our silly quaint ways of trying to teach, of course). I'm trying to think of why such a world would actually be a nightmarish dystopia. Perhaps a society needs all sorts to work, and without mean people, or less-smart it would collapse into a crap-sack world in quick order? 

With 100kt average yield, the damage radius is about 3km or about 15 sq km. Multiply times 4000. That's 60,000 sq. km. Enough to devastate most of the metropolitan areas on the planet and blast most of the military bases off the map, but the earth is 149 million sq. km (just the landmass). That's a tiny percentage. Even with intense fallout clouds, it still does not add up to enough material to render the entire planet unihabitable. Remember, the Earth is big. Actually, it is likely that more radioactive debris would enter the atmosphere from the failure of cooling bays in nuclear power plants after the attack If you really, really want to make the planet uninhabitable, you either need a massive, massive arms race, or better bombs. 

you're in a bit of a bind. PS: It's been years, so my Latin cases suck. If you actually know Latin, feel free to edit the Latin question and put the devil in the correct case... 

TL;DR - You need a constitution, separation of powers, rule of law, election laws, mechanisms and traditions to prevent coups, and lots of time to set this up. If you only had, say, 1 month, you'd be in a bit of a quandary. 

Now, assuming you somehow keep an Earth-like atmosphere, due to air diffraction, things turn blue and blurry in the distance, so even though the world goes on at a negligible angle for what seems like forever, you're only able to see a few hundred km even at the best possible visibility if you look in a direction parallel to the ground. You can always look up (only 30 km of air to look through or so), but more on that later. 

Post-structural political science, part of the third rebirth of science in the first decades of the century, encompassed the new non-linear mathematical principles developed with the aid of hyper-convoluted polysentiences, based on the lessons learned from the earlier failures during the Wars of the Greater Abominations. Using the Tao-Morgenthau ultracompressed sensing theorem to determine an optimal search-path through Hilbert spaces allows the generation of maximum likelihood chaotically reconvergent paths. While computationally demanding even against a high-end peta-qubit computer substrate, once converged, the projections ranges exhibit remarkable metastability. Most laymen refer to this as "futurecasting" and refer to the partial unknown-unknown-invariance (i.e the ability of the model to predict quasicorrectly despite a literally infinite number of unknown variables) as "freaking amazing." 

Neither is particularly plot friendly, unless you like fizzle or pop. What you need is what I'll call a probability scaffold. This is a tool that, when provided the first atom-equivalent electron-Volts of energy, uses it or discards it (returning it to the magical fount, hopefully) if unsuitable, then moves on to the next, and the next and the next. Depending on the abilities of the magical probablity scaffolder, you can generate simple objects like a bar of solid gold or if you're good, complex and otherwise impossible to build three dimensional structures. 

The Shekar are your classic imperial heartland. Fertile plains and forests watered by abundant rain in the spring make for a vast land of yeoman farmers, each rich enough to pay for their own weapons and armor (but not rich enough to each keep a herd of horses - the valuable land is better used for crops), and thanks to good land yield, vastly numerically superior to all their neighbors. The economic equality and rigors of farm work, as it did in ancient Greece and Rome, engenders a certain grit and a unique fighting style. This makes them naturals at massed formations. The Jamesian empire arose here, as the three most powerful noble republics joined forces in the Eluvian League. This also explains the 3-fold division of power in the Shadow council of the Empire. Mujeri: Magic is heritable. Your "unfortunate events" caused the Butlerian Exalted March, and added the 12th commandment to the Orange Catholic Zensunni Bible: "Thou shall not allow a witch to live" (it also applies to warlocks). The zealots exterminated magical talent from everywhere but the Mujeri islands. The Jamesian Empire has enacted a rather precarious Edict of Tolerance in the great port-city of Hombri, allowing Mages to walk the Continent again, with a limited and grudging tolerance by the population. The need to trade with the mainland for food and other staples, combined with Shekar control of the vast (formerly Vesprian) naval force makes the mages cooperative. The Ereborian Dwarves are relatively few in number, with the Northern European low fertility, late marriage capital accumulation pattern, richest of the nations, a democracy, and hugely xenophobic. They literally refuse to shed "one more drop" of dwarven blood then absolutely necessary, and have done the classical economic trade-off of labor for capital. While their (reluctantly provided) troops are not much use in the open field in their 100kg spell-reinforced dampened and diamond-forged full plate armor (not that they'd show up there willingly anyhow), their siege engines are unmatched in the world, making them vital to any large scale imperial offensive war effort. After a few brief border wars, they were quick to acknowledge the superior numbers and military genius of the Shekar, trading Shekar protection for taxes and the current limited level of military participation. Gremia and Vespria I'm having a harder time separating these, since stepped horsemen have been traditionally good archers as well. Contrary to other posters, vast plains do not make horsemen vulnerable to infantry, especially if the horsemen have bows. Moreover, the conquest usually goes the other way - from the horsemen on the plains to the settled lands. Mongols conquer China, whereas Russia only really defeated the Golden Horde by adopting their fighting style, and finally via firearms. Perhaps Vespria is a vast wooded, hilly and heavily fjorded area where a special kind of wood grows that makes for greater bows with superior range, but Gremians would still be archers as well as spearmen. So how were the steppe nomads subdued by the Shekar? Perhaps they were not, perhaps they are shock mercenary troops, serving for money. The Jamesian Wall put an end to their depredations in Shekar. The other neighbor Vespria is poor and full of skilled bowmen. Becoming Shekarian-led cavalry for hire might not sound like such a terrible idea, if the bribes and loot are rich enough. Perhaps the occasional (unhappy) Shekar princess is thrown into the mix to sweeten the deal (and, incidentally the way Byzantium and China both dealt with horse nomad khans, by the way).
