I believe part of what might make a boss upset with this would depend on what came up unexpectedly. It would be reasonable to make a request like this if you found out your mother was seriously ill and needed to go home to see her. It would not be reasonable to make this request if a buddy invited you out to drinks Friday night and you want to change your schedule again. It also depends heavily on how difficult it will be to replace you if you request another change. If you are scheduled to work in a customer facing situation (such as a retail store or restaurant) that is harder (because he will have to find a replacement on short notice) than if you are doing some software development and make up the hour the next week. Your boss's personality is also a factor. Some bosses are more flexible than others. 

To my mind the single biggest problem with self organized teams is that they don't work unless you have all outstanding performers and no real conflicts. More than 90% people working in any field are not top performers. When you have problem employees, someone has to be authorized to deal with those problems. When you have conflicts between good emplyees, someone has to be able to resolve them. When you are missing the deadline, you need someone to take action. It is really easy to abdicate responsibility if no one person has it. And as far as business, my clients would leave in droves if thought no one was driving the bus. The clients want a Point of Contact who has authority to make things happen if need be not to deal with not some nebulous self-organizing team. Further, self-organizaing teams tend to mean that only the pushiest people get the best tasks. The most common place where you see sefl-organizating teams in the real world if the cliques that form in high school. If you have ever watched a peer group of teenagers make choices with no official leaders, you know the choices are often poor and the overall end goal is often power over others not getting the task done. Why would I want to work in a poisonous atmosphere like that? I wasn't in the popular group in high school and I certainly have no need to be in the popular group now. And worse, it often means the people pick what they want to work on not what they are skilled at working on which can be an absolute disaster and at best means the project will take longer than it should. Businessses are not in business to provide you with new skill sets or toys to play with. They are in business to deliver the product in a reasonable time-frame. 

Let's start with the easiest ones first. When they send you code that needs rework, don't rework it. Send it back explaining what is wrong and when you expect the code back by. Copy his boss on the email if he says he doesn't have time or misses the deadline. Make sure to note in any reports to your manager that the delay is caused by unacceptable work from the other team. They will never get better as long as your team continues to enable them by fixing their work. He may be seen as a golden boy by his managers because nobody ever reports the lack of quality in the work his team does because they fix it themselves. The problems with him taking too long to craft his emails or not getting around to finding work for his employees are not your problem. Ignore them. This will eventually get noticed by his manager, but really how he runs his team is none of your business. Your real problem is that he wants to steal half your team. To prevent this, you need to play office politics. When you starting sending work back and making sure your management knows that it was not acceptable, that helps management become aware that his management is ineffective. You also need to be frequently highlighting the importance of your projects and tooting your own horn (and your team's of course) about the team successes. You need to make sure engagement understands the impact of moving your team members to his team. You can make a case that his team could move to you because they clearly are not implementing appropriate quality standards which is likely affecting their projects as well. You can make sure that your boss and his boss respect you and are friendly with you. Managers like this guy tend to get and keep their jobs because they spend about 50% of their time on politics. As a manager, politics is a huge part of your job and you need to make sure that it is tended to. I don't know how well you are doing those things right now as you didn't say, but if he is making a play for your team, you need to play political hardball to make sure he doesn't get it. If you feel your political skills need improving, you should read some books on the subject as it can get very complicated. This is not something you can afford to ignore if he is trying to grab half you team. 

This is where you need to use initiative. Likely your boss has no easy answers either. You say in a comment that other departments have done something using this approach that is not directly applicable. I would set up an appointment to talk to the people who did those projects and find out what types of problems they had and what they learned that you can apply to your own design. For instnce they may tell you that approach A (the one you were considering) won't work becasue of security policies on your network. They got around the problem by using approach d which you had not even run into as an idea yet. So by finding out the types of problems they had to solve when doing thier implementations, you may be able to avoid making some of the same mistakes. If you can, get tehm to walk you through their project (code included if this si a programming type project) so you can understnad what they did. The more you understnd about what they did, the easier it is going to be figure out how to approach your differnt problem. 

It would depend on the corporate culture. There are places where beards, tatoos, nose rings etc are acceptable and places where they are not. If colleagues are telling you it is limiting you where you are then you are at one of the places where the culture is more conservative as far as professional look and you need to either conform or move on. 

You have to judge based on the urgency of needing the reply, how urgent the item might be to the person who needs to respond, and whether nudging them will be more detrimental rather than less. For instance in the job appliaction, nudging them will not make them move faster and is likely to make them mad at you and reduce your chances of getting the job if you are a pain about it. But suppose you have a work issue where something is failing and you need a response in order to fix it (for instance I can't work on failing feeds unless I have a job to charge the work to). If I have people who can;t log in becasue the import has failed and teh new users have not been imported, that is critical, so I would follow up within a couple of hours if I got no response to my email request for a job ticket to work on (Probably by phone this time). If I was working on an RFP (Request for Proposal) to compete for new work and needed some information from somone, I would try to ask for it in time so that they would have at least a week to respond but the would followup at least a couple of days before the immoveable deadline of an RFP. If I was working on something that I needed a response to and was not getting one even after requesting more than once, I woudl escalte to the next higher level. YOu have to remeber in business people are not sitting around waiting for you to send them requests and their priorities may not align with yours. When someone failes to respond, escalating will ensure the priorites are realigned or you will be told not to bother this person because his priorities are genuinely higher than yours. Generally you should only escalate if the task is genuninely important or if the person is rountinely non-responsive to your requests. 

The first thing you do is inform your boss of the issue. Then you and he get together and determine what the response to the client should be and if it is possible to get the report early with a review. These reviewes are institituted usually for a very good reason. However, you might ask the client why they need it earlier than usual so that you can give your boss that information. If it is a good enough reason, your company might bypass the review int his one instance *(or ask the reviewer to stay late to do the review) but it is not your call at any rate. This is a senior mamangement call and the best you can do is pass it up to them after collecting the information they need to make an informed decision. 

Whether it is OK is not the question. Life isn't fair and what has happened can't be made to unhappen. What to do from here is the question. First since they didn't appear to give you any specific plan for how to improve, you need to develop one. It doesn't matter if you agree with the assertions or not, you have to show the attitude that you are are fixing the problem. Write out each point where they felt your performance was lacking and then write what you can do about it. Concerning not doing a job you had never been assigned to do, I'd suggest you talk to you boss about how he wants you to confirm what you are wokring on and what things you think you have been assigned to so that nothing slips through the cracks again. You want to go over priorities with him daily if possible but weekly at a minumum. Ask for a written response from him confirming your priorities so there is no question what you have been assigned to do that day. Perhaps it was his fault he didn't tell you to work in that area or perhpas he did tell you and you forgot or perhaps he sent an email that you missed reading. It doesn't really matter what happened as he thinks you should have done the work. What matters is taking steps to ensure that you are doing what he thinks you are supposed to be doing. Once you have a plan in place for what specific steps you can take to improve your performance, then do them. Make sure to check in with your boss frequently about whether he has seen imporvement and what else you could do. You need to learn to communicate with your boss better, it should not have been a surprise that he was unhappy with your performance. I am a senior person and I still confer with my boss several times a week about priorities becasue I need to know that what he thinks is most important is what I think is most important. I know him and the company pretty well, so 95% or more of the time I have the correct priorities but it is those ones you missed that come back to bite you. The other thing I do is make sure my boss knows immediately when there is a problem I will not be able resolve quickly that will affect clients or other employees. I tell him what I am doing to fix the problem, but the one thing you never want is for your boss to hear about a problem in your area from someone else especially someone he reports to. You need to start managing your boss's expectations. Because he is unhappy with your performance, right now you need to overcommunicate. Most likely what you consider overcommunicating is still undercommunicating in his eyes, so ask him exactly what he expects from you in terms of information on what you are doing and them give him more than what he asked for. Once you have regained your boss's trust, you need to discuss having your parents in the meeting with you. This was 100% inappropriate on his part. It was not their business, they did not belong there. There is no point bringing it up right now, but later on you need to make sure he understands that you are an adult and would appreciate being treated as one from then on. Immediately, I would talk to my parents and ask them to excuse themselves from any further meetings if they are invited. Your performance is none of their business. You are an adult, they do not have supervision over your actions as an adult even if you live at home. What you do at work is none of their business unless you directly report to them. It is appalling to me that they did not immediately leave the meeting when it became clear what it was about. This was highly unprofessional on their part and on your bosses part. Make sure your parents don't overstep their bounds in the future and that they know this is your problem to handle not theirs. 

My advice would be listen more than you talk. Ask pertinent questions but respect that your colleagues have other things to do than answer your questions, so don't be a pest. And most especially don't criticize their systems until you have produced some work of your own and gained a reputation from knowing your stuff. Think about what kind of person you want to be viewed as and act accordingly. 

First, do the task and do it correctly to the best of your ability. To do otherwise shows a severe lack of professionalism. There is no indicator that you have discussed your performance or what you would like to be doing with your boss. Ask him what you need to do to get assigned to the types of tasks you would prefer. Talk to him about what is upcoming on the project and where you might best fit in. You may find that he has plans but is waiting for a budget to get approved or you may find that you have unimpressed him with your attitude towards the tasks you distain. Or somewhere in between. We can't know what he thinks of you and your abilities and what he needs from you to feel comfortable taking the risk of assigning programming work to you (and it is huge risk for him, you have to understand that as many interns severely overestimate their abilities). Or it may be that no one has the time to help you get up to speed. It may even be that he didn't particularly want or need an intern. Remeber, as an intern you are the lowest person on the totem pole and you will be assigned to tasks that need to get done but which are not exciting because nobody senior to you wants to do them either. And in the work world, you can expect there will always be some things you would prefer not to do that you still have to do. It gets better as you get more experience, but it never goes away. 

I agree with @ReallyTiredOfThisGame's answer but wanted to add something if you think it is not going to be a good idea to report these specific instances You should review your company policies on What is acceptable and not acceptable. Then without mentioning you saw this material, you might send out a reminder about the policy against porn (you can tell your boss that you were reading about some issue having to do with problems due to porn on a some other company's network as the reason why you think a reminder would be a good idea, I'm sure Google could find some bad examples for you pretty quickly).or suggest to your boss that it would protect the company if they had an explicit porn policy. 

First, you have to accept that if you are doing your job well, then your work makes others look bad. That is nature of what you do and you cannot compromise that in order to maintain friendly relationships. So first accept that you are not ever going to be popular. However, that doesn't mean you can't be respected. To do that, first be absolutely sure that you are right when you criticize the practices of others. Every time you are right, you gain credibility. When I worked for an audit agency, we almost lost a political battle on a major multi-million dollar finding due to a rounding error of a couple of cents. Next, you need to listen to their responses and see if you can find something you can agree with. If you were wrong and they pointed out a valid mitigating factor, then you will be better off to agree and go from there. This doesn't mean change everything due to what they say in response, that is a bad thing. But when they are right and you are wrong, you have to admit it and change the finding. You will get respect because you listened and you admitted to a mistake rather than fighting tooth and nail to avoid admitting a mistake. If you balance reports by mentioning things that you found that they did correctly, that helps too. Also, you may need to talk to your own boss about whether something is minor enough not to be brought up or when it needs to be brought up. People have more trouble with auditors who find only picky ridiculous things than with auditors who find genuinely major problems. Your organization will have its own standards on what needs to be in the report and what might be communicated informally. Your boss should give you guidance on this. If possible concentrate the most time and effort on major issues. Now of course, you will always remain cordial and professional when talking to others. But truly you do not want to make friends with people outside your department who you may audit, that is a conflict of interest. If you are friends with Joe and you audit his group and he is the only person who doesn't have many issues, are they going to assume that his friendships is why you were easier on him? Best not to go there or you may end up either destroying your professional credibility or losing a friend. You also have to develop a thick skin. Yes they are going to disagree and they may even say not so nice things about you. You have to rise above and not respond in kind. You have to understand, they are not mad at you as a person but at your job function. I had to learn this early on when I was a manpower specialist (people don't like being told they need fewer people either!) and it has served me well through the years. If you are in a not popular job, then negative reactions are part of that job and you have to learn to not let them get to you. It becomes almost a badge of pride that you found something major enough that it made them mad.
