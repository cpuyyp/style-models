More or less the question title. My final-year logic course a few years back covered a number of non-classical logics (deontic, Kleene/Lukasiewicz multi-valued, etc.), however dialetheism was left as little more than a footnote in spite of a somewhat important name in the area being from the same university. I would like to read a little more on the topic to actually understand what is going on, and I'm looking for the first work that introduced it as a serious, defend-able position under the assumption that it is likely to have a reasonable explanation of the fundamental argument in the face of the obvious initial objections. 

1) I don't recall exactly those experiments, sorry; I only remember reading about it, but no doubt they involve exponentially increasing effects (i.e. chaos, in its mathematical meaning, more informally the butterfly effect) and inspecting ever more fine details. 2) I almost used the acronym SDS, Heinlein's Super Duper Snooper, with a footnote explaining it, but then I thought better of it. 3) Can't leave this without mentioning Charles Stross' “Accelerando” universe and “Glasshouse” novel. 

This is called disjunctive normal form, because it's a disjunction of individual conjunctions of the possible combinations of terms. You do not have to define each such table separately. 

Now if you put these two ideas together and assert as your antecedent the assertion that W ∧ X ∧ Y, and make your consequent C. That is, 

Yes you will definitely be able to understand those texts, but that statement needs some qualification. Firstly, you need to understand that more of the work in reading texts is to do with how much mental work you put in to considering and challenging their ideas. Simply reading the text like a novel probably won't leave you too much more enlightened. This is much easier if the language of the work/translation you are reading is your first language, but of course that isn't 100% necessary. Secondly, you probably won't finish the text with quite the same depth of understanding of someone who has experience with other ideas that are related to the texts, (what the text is responding to and why, what common counter-arguments are, etc.). This is fine, and everyone starts out this way, but don't always expect to fully "get" a text the first time you read it (especially in the case of Nietzsche). Because of this, if you have a series of related texts I would normally suggest reading them in the order they were written unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. (EDIT: Something a lot of people do is to read the original text alongside an companion text that is meant to explain the ideas in a more plain-language manner, and I've heard a lot of people recommend it if you can find a decent companion text.) To answer your question at the end, Pythagoras was very influential but isn't necessary for any of the texts you listed, and Aristotle was Plato's student so Plato's ideas naturally wouldn't rely on that. 

Apparently Searle changed his opinion in these ten years, since the statements appear to be directly mutually contradictory. Regarding that aspect I mailed Searle, but he didn't answer. A typical SO reader may think I'm unrealistic in expecting an answer, and indeed in my experience, limited to two cases though, philosophers do not answer critique or admit to errors, but e.g. in my own field of C++ programming the top people such as Bjarne Stroustrup and Andrew Koenig are more than willing to discuss things, admit errors (and collect them in errata lists), and so on, and that's also for a few cases been my experience in the field of physics (e.g. I once pointed out a problem with the description of something in Scientific American's "expert answers" column and they put John Baez on it who just fixed it). So I don't think I was unrealistic. But no answer so far. Hence I'm asking here: 

By the definition of validity, the conclusion must be true if all of the statements in the argument are true. In this case, we don't really care about the situations where W, X, or Y are not true - we can still call the argument valid. Consider the truth-table for a conditional. From this, we can see that any conditional statement is true except in the case where the antecedent (the part that follows 'if...') is true and the consequent (following 'then...') is false. 

The only way I can see of doing this would be to create a truth table/tree/etc. and then by brute force check to see which premises have no effect on the truth-value of the conclusion. Then if you find such a premise, you know that it is redundant (and sometimes this happens entirely innocently, but because one of the premises e.g. becomes part of a larger tautology of which several of the components are not needed). P.S. This is just speculation, but I suspect that this problem arises because of the assumption that if someone includes a statement in their argument, then they must believe that the statement lends logical support to its conclusion. This could actually lead to an interesting discussion about whether when we make an argument we are also creating a second logical argument in tandem that asserts that the logic used in the original holds water, and that both of these 'sub-arguments' need to give a true conclusion for the 'argument' as a whole to be 'acceptable'. This would be why we can attack an argument by attacking it's use of logic instead of simply trying to disprove its premises, and the statement "Premise A is relevant to the conclusion", "Premise B is relevant to the conclusion", etc. might be implicit (or not) in that tandem argument. 

E.g. I don't accept that criticism of Israel is criticism of Jews or is anti-Semitic. And e.g. I don't accept that one should discourage people from drawing caricatures of Mohammed. And in particular I don't accept that one should refrain from calling a spade a spade when it comes to nonsense philosophy . For example, I think it's right and necessary to dismiss Kurt Gödel's proof of the Christian faith's god as nonsense (it can be applied to any other incompatible god), and idiotic nonsense at that, but that doesn't mean that it would be right to say that Gödel, a mathematical genius if there ever was one, was dumb or idiotic. Geniuses can maintain idiotic things, and as I see it, I should not be so afraid of being labeled this and that that I should in any way refrain from treating the idiotic nonsense with the simple lack of respect that it does deserve, while treating the man with the enormous respect that he truly deserves (in particular for his completeness theorems, and his incompleteness theorems). Of course, in the case of groups such as ISIS, the individual persons will probably not deserve any respect; I'm not dogmatic about respecting people. I guess that there must be some established philosophy about this, and I guess that I would have to go in that direction in order to frame a useful question that can be simply answered, instead of as in philosophy, discussed. So, tentatively I'm asking if the approach outlined about is morally defensible? 

You are correct that the idea appears in Plato's Republic, though it may also appear elsewhere. I believe that section 521 is the reference you are looking for, though it may appear in other places in the text as well: 

From the premise of the initial quote that the argument is valid there can be no case where you are posing the antecedent's statement (W ∧ X ∧ Y) as true and the consequent (C) false. Thus, it is a tautology as there is no case in which the statement itself is false. (Note that this necessitates that W,X,Y includes ALL premises of the argument we know to be valid, not just some subset of them.) 

can not entirely be understood this way, because of the word “hence”. I suspect that something’s been lost in translation here. 

if it is rephrased as “challenged” then the Wikipedia quote above applies and the answer is a clear yes. However, if you mean whether there is still a challange going on, literally “challenges”, then that depends on what exactly you mean by logical positivism for the present, and I have no answer. Presumably, though, a continued challenge based on some evolution of the concept of logical positivism is not an issue, or else it would surely have been mentioned. 

In classical propositional logic, an argument is invalid iff. there is a situation in which the premises can be true and the conclusion false. So by that measure (assuming that you have premises that can possibly be all true at one time) your argument that concludes in a contradiction would be invalid. However, what is worth noting is that you didn't state was what kind of logic is being used to analyze this argument - Paraconsistent logics such as dialetheism accept that there can be true contradictions, which can throw a spanner in the works here. 

Several organized or semi-organized groups of people in the world have really horrendous ideas, and react disproportionally strongly to any critique. I think most readers can agree with that statement, although we might disagree about which groups constitute examples of this. My set of such groups currently include militant Islamists like ISIS, the far right and far left political fringes in the West, the fanatically pro-Israeli (who tend to label any criticism as anti-Semitic), the fanatic Palestinians, and, yes, the typical modern day philosophers who, according to highly respected philosopher John Searle, make a living producing a lot of (quote) (1)“nonsense”. Now my general approach to such groups is to not accept or bow to their rules.
