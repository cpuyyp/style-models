The Sorgenfrey plane is not metacompact by Example 2 in these notes. However, the Sorgenfrey plane is the product of two paracompact (and hence metacompact) spaces. Therefore metacompact spaces are not even closed under taking finite products. By transfinite induction, one can show that every open cover of the Sorgenfrey line $S$ has a refinement that partitions $S$ into intervals of the form $[a,b)$. Let me now give an explicit example with proof of a cover of the Sorgenfrey plane $S\times S$ with no point finite open refinement. For each real number $x$, let $U_{r}=[r,\infty)\times[-r,\infty)$ and let $U=\{(x,y)\in S\times S|x+y<0\}$. Let $\mathcal{U}=\{U\}\cup\{U_{r}|r\in S\}$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $S\times S$. I however claim that $\mathcal{U}$ has no point-finite open refinement. Suppose that $\mathcal{V}$ is an open refinement of $\mathcal{U}$. Then for each $r\in S$, there is some $V_{r}\in\mathcal{V}$ with $(r,-r)\in V_{r}$ and each $V_{r}$ is distinct. Therefore, for each $r\in S$, there is some $\epsilon_{r}>0$ such that $[r,r+\epsilon_{r})\times[-r,-r+\epsilon_{r})\subseteq V_{r}$. Let $A_{n}=\{r\in\mathbb{R}|\epsilon_{r}<\frac{1}{n}\}$. Then there is some $A_{n}$ which is non-meager. In particular, $A_{n}$ is not nowhere dense, so there is some interval $I$ so that $A_{n}\cap I$ is a dense subspace of $I$. However, since $A_{n}\cap I$ is a dense subspace of $I$, if $r\in I$, then we have $\langle r+\frac{1}{2n},-r+\frac{1}{2n}\rangle\in [s,s+\epsilon_{s})\times[-s,-s+\epsilon_{s})\subseteq V_{s}$ whenever $s\in I\cap A_{n}\cap(r-\frac{1}{2n},r+\frac{1}{2n})$. Since $\langle r+\frac{1}{2n},-r+\frac{1}{2n}\rangle$ is contained in infinitely many sets of the form $V_{s}$, the refinement $\mathcal{V}$ is not point finite. Therefore $X$ is not metacompact. 

$\Gamma(x*y)\leq\Gamma(y)$ whenever $\Gamma(y)<\Gamma(x)$, and $\Gamma(x*y)>\Gamma(y)$ whenever $\Gamma(y)\geq\Gamma(x)$. 

I claim that every infinite complete Boolean algebra does not have Krull dimension. Let's begin with some definitions. A poset $P$ is said to have Krull dimension $0$ if for each descending sequence $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, we have $x_{n}=x_{n+1}$ for some $n$ (i.e. $P$ satisfies the descending chain condition). If $\alpha$ is an ordinal, then a poset $P$ is said to have Krull dimension at most $\alpha$ if for each infinite descending sequence $(x_{n})_{n}$ there is some $\beta<\alpha$ and $N$ where for each $n\geq N$, the interval $[x_{n+1},x_{n}]$ has Krull dimension at most $\beta$. A poset $P$ has Krull dimension if there is some ordinal $\alpha$ where $P$ has Krull dimension at most $\alpha$. Suppose to the contrary there is an infinite Boolean algebra $B$ that does have Krull dimension. Then let $\alpha$ be the least ordinal such that there is an infinite complete Boolean algebra $B$ with Krull dimension $\alpha$. Then it is easy to show that there is a descending sequence $(x_{n})_{n}$ where each interval $[x_{n},x_{n+1}]$ is infinite. Therefore, since each interval $[x_{n},x_{n+1}]$ is an infinite complete Boolean lattice, the Krull dimension of each interval $[x_{n},x_{n+1}]$ is at least $\alpha$. This is a contradiction. On the other hand, there are many Boolean algebras with Krull dimension such as the Boolean algebra of finite and cofinite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$. 

In this answer, I will assume that all spaces are Hausdorff. It is well known that a space is compact if and only if it is pseudocompact and realcompact[See The Stone Cech Compactification by Russel Walker p.34]. A space is realcompact if and only if it can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{I}$ as a closed subspace. Also, in the topology book by Dugundji, the author proves that a space is compact if and only if it is countably compact and metacompact. Here metacompact means that every open covering has a point-finite open refinement (A cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ is point finite if $\{U\in\mathcal{U}|x\in U\}$ is finite for each $x\in X$). In particular, a space is compact if and only if it is pseudocompact and metacompact. Since Metrizable implies paracompact implies metacompact, every pseudocompact metrizable space is compact. For an easy example of a completely regular pseudocompact space that is not compact try the set $\omega_{1}$ of all countable ordinals. In fact, it can easily be shown that every continuous map $f:\omega_{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is eventially constant. 

Therefore to represent a $\sigma$-algebra as a sequence of simpler Boolean algebras, one would need a directed system of Boolean subalgebras or at least an uncountable sequence of partitions. I also must mention that approximating Boolean algebras by partitions has been a fruitful endeavor for me. My dissertation (Boolean Partition Algebras 2013) and some of my further research has dealt with representing Boolean algebras as directed unions of subalgebras which are generated by partitions. Define a Boolean partition algebra to be a pair $(B,F)$ such that $B$ is a Boolean algebra and $F$ is a filter on the meet-semilattice of partitions of $B$ such that $B=\{0\}\cup\bigcup F$. If $p\in F$, then define $p^{*}=\{\bigvee R|R\subseteq p,\bigvee R\,\,\textrm{exists}\}$. It is not to hard to show that each $p^{*}$ is a Boolean subalgebra of $B$. Furthermore, it is easy to show that if $(B,F)$ is a Boolean partition algebra, then $B=\bigcup_{p\in F}p^{*}$. We say that a partition $p$ is subcomplete if the Boolean algebra $p^{*}$ is a complete Boolean algebra. I found Boolean partition algebras to be useful since the category of Boolean partition algebras is equivalent to other categories such as the category of all complete non-Archimedean uniform frames and it is contravariantly equivalent to the category of pro-sets with surjective transitional mappings (pro-sets are inverse systems of sets). Furthermore, ideas such as taking quotient Boolean algebras and taking subalgebras translate nicely into taking sub-inverse systems and taking quotient inverse systems. Furthermore, the notion of a $\sigma$-ideal, $\sigma$-subalgebra, and $\sigma$-homomorphism between $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras can all be represented as special ideals, subalgebras, and homomorphisms between Boolean partition algebras. 

I shall answer question 1 here by proving by contrapositive that every metric space with countable extent is Lindelof. Assume that $X$ is a metric space that is not Lindelof. Then $X$ is not separable (for metric spaces, the properties of second countability, Lindelof, and separability are all equivalent as commented above. See Dugundji p. 187). We shall now construct a sequence $(x_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\omega_{1}}$ by transfinite induction. For each $\alpha<\omega_{1}$, let $U_{\alpha}=X\setminus\overline{\{x_{\beta}|\beta<\alpha\}}$. Clearly $U_{\alpha}$ is a non-empty open set for all $\alpha$ since $X$ is not separable. Let $\epsilon_{\alpha}=\sup\{\epsilon|B_{\epsilon}(x)\subseteq U_{\alpha}\,\textrm{for some}\,x\in X\}$. Let $x_{\alpha}$ be a point where $B_{\epsilon_{\alpha}/2}(x_{\alpha})\subseteq U_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha$. We observe that $\epsilon_{\alpha}$ is a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers of length $\omega_{1}$. Therefore, the sequence $\epsilon_{\alpha}$ is eventually some constant $\epsilon>0$. Therefore $B_{\epsilon/2}(x_{\alpha})\subseteq U_{\alpha}=X\setminus\overline{\{x_{\beta}|\beta<\alpha\}}$, so if $\beta<\alpha$, then $d(x_{\beta},x_{\alpha})\geq\epsilon/2$. Therefore the set $\{x_{\alpha}|\alpha<\omega_{1}\}$ is a closed discrete set(in fact uniformly discrete), so $X$ does not have countable extent. 

Give $\varprojlim A_{n}$ the Borel probability measure $\mu$ where for $i\in\{1,...,2^{N}\}$ we have $\mu(\{(x_{n})_{n}|x_{N}=i\})=(\frac{1}{2})^{N}$. Let $j\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$. Let $E\subseteq\varprojlim A_{n}$ be the set of all $(x_{n})_{n}$ such that there is some $k\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ where $k\equiv^{\kappa_{n}}j_{[x_{n}]}$ for all $n\in\omega$ where $\kappa_{n}$ is the $n$-th element in $S=\{\text{crit}(l)|l\in\langle j\rangle\}$ (for example, $crit(j)$ is the $0$-th element in $S$). What is the measure $\mu(E)$? Is $\mu(E)=0$? $\mathbf{Note:}$ As with many questions about the algebras of elementary embeddings, one can formulate this question in terms of algebra and topology without any mention of large cardinals. Let $U_{m}$ be the set of all $(x_{n})_{n\in\omega}\in\varprojlim A_{n}$ such that there is some $n$ where $x_{n}*_{n}2^{m}<2^{n}$. Then $U_{m}$ is open in $\varprojlim A_{n}$ and $E=\bigcap_{m}U_{m}$ which is a $G_{\delta}$-set and if a rank-into-rank cardinal exists, then $E$ is dense in $\varprojlim A_{n}$. 

$\mathcal{H}(L,A)$ is a topological closure system. each $a\in A$ is join-prime in $L$ the lattice $L$ is distributive and each $a\in A$ is join-irreducible in $L$ the lattice $L$ is a coframe and each $a\in A$ is a join-irreducible in $L$. /// 

Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be an algebraic structure. If $t$ is an $n+1$-ary term, then let $L_{t,a_{1},...,a_{n}}:X\rightarrow X$ be the mapping defined by $L_{t,a_{1},...,a_{n}}(x)=t(a_{1},...,a_{n},x)$. We say that a $n+1$-ary term $t$ is endomorphic if $L_{t,a_{1},...,a_{n}}$ is an endomorphism whenever $a_{1},...,a_{n}\in X$. The endomorphisms of the form $L_{t,a_{1},...,a_{n}}$ are known as inner endomorphisms. What are some examples of inner endomorphisms? What are some examples of endomorphic terms? Let me give a couple examples to start things off: 

A ternary self-distributive algebra is an algebra $(X,t)$ that satisfies the identity $$t(u,v,t(x,y,z))=t(t(u,v,x),t(u,v,y),t(u,v,z)).$$ Is the equational theory of the variety of ternary self-distributive algebras decidable? If so, then when are two terms equivalent in the variety of ternary self-distributive algebras. It may be easier to prove the decidability of this variety if one assumes strong large cardinal hypotheses. 

$\mathbf{Theorem}$ Let $X$ be a $T_{1}$-space. Let $\mathcal{Z}$ denote the lattice of all closed subsets of $X$. Let $M\subseteq\mathcal{Z}$ be a maximal filter. Then $M=\{C\in\mathcal{Z}|x\in C\}$ for some $x\in X$ or $M$ is not countably generated. $\mathbf{Proof}$ Assume that $M$ is countably generated, and $M\neq\{C\in\mathcal{Z}|x\in C\}$ for all $x\in X$. Then $\bigcap M=\emptyset$. Otherwise, if $x\in\bigcap M$, then $M\subseteq\{C\in\mathcal{Z}|x\in C\}$, so $M=\{C\in\mathcal{Z}|x\in C\}$ by maximality. Assume $M$ is countably generated by some decreasing sequence $(C_{n})_{n}$ of closed sets. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the sequence $(C_{n})_{n}$ is strictly decreasing. Let $x_{n}\in C_{n}\setminus C_{n-1}$ for all $n$. Let $U_{n}=C_{n}^{c}$ for all $n$. Then $(U_{n})_{n}$ is a countable open cover of $X$. However, if $A\subseteq\{x_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$, then $A\cap U_{n}$ is finite for all n, hence $A\cap U_{n}$ is closed in $U_{n}$ for all $n$. Therefore, since $(U_{n})_{n}$ covers $X$, the set $A$ is closed. Therefore, the set $C=\{x_{2n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a closed set in $X$, but $C_{n}\not\subseteq C$ for all $n$ contradicting the maximality of $M$. QED 

It is very difficult to build a completely new algebraic structure completely from scratch using a recursive construction which satisfies nice algebraic properties. The natural numbers with can be thought of as being built from scratch. The set of all strings together with the concatenation operation is another example of an algebraic structure built from scratch. The mechanisms for producing new algebraic structures with interesting algebraic properties from old structures tend to generate new structures in the above classes. These mechanisms include taking automorphism groups, endomorphism monoids, (semi)-direct products, congruences, various notions of completion, various notions of extending algebras (like algebraic closure, Grothendieck groups, etc.), etc. 

Here is a simple counterexample. Let $T$ be the theory of sets with no additional structure. Let $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ be the set $\omega+\alpha$ with no additional structure, and let $\mathcal{N}_{\alpha}=\mathbb{N}$ for all $\alpha<\omega_{1}$. Then if $\alpha\leq\beta$, then $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ is an elementary substructure of $\mathcal{M}_{\beta}$ and $\mathcal{N}_{\alpha}$ is an elementary substructure of $\mathcal{N}_{\beta}$. Furthermore, $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{N}_{\alpha}$ for all countable ordinals $\alpha$. On the other hand, $\bigcup_{\alpha<\omega_{1}}\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ has cardinality $\aleph_{1}$ while $\bigcup_{\alpha<\omega_{1}}\mathcal{N}_{\alpha}$ is countable. The same argument holds for chains whose length is a successor cardinal. 

The bounded distributive lattices which every prime filter is principal can be characterized in terms of Priestley spaces, Priestley duality and certain posets (these are some results that I proved a while ago but I would not be surprised if someone else has already obtained these results already). Let me review some facts about Priestley duality. A partially ordered compact space $X$ is said to be a Priestley space if whenever $x\not\leq y$ then there is a clopen upper set $U$ with $x\in U$ and $y\not\in U$. If $X$ is a priestley space, then let $\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)$ be the collection of all clopen downwards closed subsets of $X$. Then $\mathcal{C}_{d}(X)$. Suppose that $D$ is a bounded distributive lattice. Let $\mathcal{I}_{p}(D)$ be the set of all prime ideals in $D$ ordered by inclusion. If $a\in D$, then let $C_{a}=\{I\in\mathcal{I}_{p}(D)|a\not\in I\}$. Then $\{C_{a}\setminus C_{b}|a,b\in D\}$ is a basis for a Priestley space topology on $\mathcal{I}_{p}(D)$. Priestley duality states that if $D$ is a distributive lattice, then $D\simeq \mathcal{C}_{d}(\mathcal{I}_{p}(D))$ and if $X$ is a priestley space, then $X\simeq\mathcal{I}_{p}(\mathcal{C}_{p}(X))$ and that these isomorphisms are natural. Suppose that $(X,\leq,\mathcal{T})$ be an ordered topological space. Then we shall call $(X,\leq,\mathcal{T})$ an upper limit system if each set of the form $\downarrow x$ is closed and $\{\downarrow x\cap U|x\in X,\text{$U$ is an open upwards closed set}\}$ forms a basis for the topology $\mathcal{T}$. Take note that if $(X,\leq,\mathcal{T})$ is an upper limit system, then each set $\downarrow x$ is clopen and each lower set is open. $\mathbf{Lemma}$ Suppose that $X$ is a Priestley space. Let $x\in X$. Then 

Is it consistent with ZFC that there exists an uncountable separable metric space $X$ such that every subset of $X$ is a Borel set? If the continuum hypothesis holds, or more generally $2^{\aleph_{0}}<2^{\aleph_{1}}$ , then each uncountable separable metric space contains non-Borel sets since there are only $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ Borel sets. Therefore, in order for there to be an uncountable separable metric space $X$ where every subset of $X$ is Borel, we would need to at least have $2^{\aleph_{0}}=2^{\aleph_{1}}$. What other conditions are necessary in order for there to exist an uncountable separable metric space $X$ where every subset of $X$ is Borel? 

The algebras of elementary embeddings have been studied from a set theoretic perspective and an algebraic perspective. I wonder is there is a purely model theoretic approach to the self-distributive algebras of elementary embeddings that does not mention any set theory. Let $L$ be the language with a single binary function symbol $*$. Let $T$ be the theory over the language generated by the sentences of the form $\forall x,x_{1},...,x_{n},\phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})\leftrightarrow\phi(x*x_{1},...,x*x_{n})$ where $\phi$ is any first order formula. Observe that $T$ implies the self-distributivity identity $x*(y*z)=(x*y)*(x*z)$ and that $*$ is left-cancellative. All racks and quandles satisfy the theory $T$. The motivation behind the theory $T$ is that the theory $T$ axiomatizes the notion of an inner-elementary embedding. Let $\theta$ denote the sentence $\forall x\exists y\forall z,y*z=x$ and let $T^{+}=T\cup\{\theta\}$. Observations 

I want to know if there are fairly simple combinatorial necessary conditions for when a direct limit of ultrapowers of $V$ is well-founded similar to $\sigma$-completeness. By combinatorial, I mean that these conditions are conditions on the ultrafilters instead of the elementary embeddings they produce. For simplicity, we shall formulate the question with regards to the following ultrapower construction. Assume that $X$ is a set and $(P_{n})_{n}$ is a sequence of partitions of $X$ such that $P_{n+1}$ refines $P_{n}$ for all $n$ and whenever $x,y\in X,x\neq y$ there is some $n$ where $x,y$ belong to different blocks of the partition $P_{n}$. Furthermore, assume that whenever $R_{n}\in P_{n}$ and $R_{n+1}\subseteq R_{n}$ for all $n$ then $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}$ is non-empty. Let $B=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}\{\bigcup\mathcal{R}|\mathcal{R}\subseteq P_{n}\}$. Then $B$ is a Boolean algebra. Let $U$ be an ultrafilter on $B$. We shall use the ultrafilter $U$ to construct an ultrapower. Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a structure. Then let $\mathcal{A}^{(P_{n})_{n}}$ be the collection of all functions $f:X\rightarrow\mathcal{A}$ where there is some natural number $n$ where $P_{n}\preceq\{f^{-1}[\{a\}]|a\in\mathcal{A}\}$ (the ordering $\preceq$ is refinement of partitions). Now let $\simeq_{U}$ be the equivalence relation on $\mathcal{A}^{(P_{n})_{n}}$ where $f\simeq_{U}g$ if and only if $\{x\in X|f(x)=g(x)\}\in U$. One can define the fundamental operations, constants, and relations on $\mathcal{A}^{(P_{n})_{n}}/\simeq_{U}$ as one does with the classical ultrapower construction. Let the structure $\mathcal{A}^{(P_{n})_{n}}/\simeq_{U}$ be denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{(P_{n})_{n}}/U$. Is there a fairly simple combinatorial characterization of when the ultrapower $V^{(P_{n})_{n}}/U$ well-founded? For instance, in order for $V^{(P_{n})_{n}}/U$ to be well-founded, the ultrafilters $\{\mathcal{R}\subseteq P_{n}|\bigcup\mathcal{R}\in U\}$ must be $\sigma$-complete. On the other hand, if whenever $R_{n}\in\mathcal{U}$ for all $n$, we have $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}\neq\emptyset$, then the ultrapower $V^{(P_{n})_{n}}/U$ is well-founded. Even though I just listed necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for when an ultrapower is well-founded, I do not know of any conditions that are both necessary and sufficient. Can someone give a reference or a proof of combinatorial necessary and sufficient conditions for when such an ultrapower is well-founded? If $V^{(P_{n})_{n}}/U$ is well-founded, then do we necessarily have $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}\neq\emptyset$ whenever $R_{n}\in U$ for all $n$? $\textrm{This last question was answered affirmatively by Joel David Hamkins}$ $\textbf{Remark}$ Although I phrased this question in terms of a direct limit of a countable sequence of ultrapowers, this characterization also holds for any kind of direct limit of ultrapowers since any possible infinite descending sequence in an ultrapower of a well-founded set must be in a countable direct limit of ultrapowers. Furthermore, the condition that $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}\neq\emptyset$ whenever $R_{n}\in P_{n},R_{n+1}\subseteq R_{n}$ for all $ n$ does not restrict the types of ultrapowers that one can form since one can always extend the set $X$ to a larger set $\hat{X}$ so that $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}\neq\emptyset$ whenever $R_{n}\in P_{n},R_{n+1}\subseteq R_{n}$. For instance, give $X$ the uniformity where the uniform covers are generated by the uniform partitions $P_{n}$. Then the appropriate set $\hat{X}$ is the completion of the uniform space $X$. Equivalently, one can let $\hat{X}=\varprojlim_{n}P_{n}.$ By replacing $X$ with $\hat{X}$ one obtains an isomorphic ultrapower but where $\bigcap_{n}R_{n}\neq\emptyset$ whenever $R_{n}\in P_{n},R_{n+1}\subseteq R_{n}$ for all $n$.
