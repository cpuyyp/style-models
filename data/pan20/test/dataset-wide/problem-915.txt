As far as I can tell, this seems not to be quite a formal, well-defined term. Rather, it's the use of an iconic cultural touchstone as shorthand for issues and tropes that come up often - and, just as the original creation can be interpreted in different ways, can be admired or criticized, people's use of the phrase "Devdas syndrome" seems to depend on their own interpretation of the story. Devdas is a tragedy -- rich Devdas and middle-class Parvati are in love, but the match is prevented by family, class, and culture. Devdas goes into a self-destructive spiral of melancholy and alcohol. "The Devdas Phenomenon", by Corey K. Creekmur, summarizes: 

I think the problem here lies in the distinction between an aphorism and a quotation. An aphorism is a pithy saying meant to express a general truth. We assume that the author of an aphorism believes what they are saying. What we commonly call "quotes" are in fact generally aphorisms. All aphorisms are quotations, of course, but not all quotations are aphorisms. 

The later doctrine of American exceptionalism seems to be a secularization of this idea: an exceptionalism based on civic virtues and the constitution rather than on love and grace. Modern liberalism generally is basically a secularized version of Christianity. 

This, allowing for certain changes in rhetorical style over the years, could be Bernie Sanders. Except Bernie Sander would not likely quote Deuteronomy in support of this assertion. 

(I do not know whether this anecdote is true, false, or a fictional portrayal, but in any event it's indicative of public opinion of the creation.) 

What this means is that the combination, the premise, is contrived rather than happenstance. Not any three individuals would torment each other eternally, not even any three damned sinners. But these three were specially picked and matched to each other because they would torment each other forever, and would be incapable of stopping themselves, even as they recognize what they are doing. 

In the finale of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, the protagonists release the Salaxalan ghost (in Wenton-Weakes' body) in the primordial past, to go fix his ship, when they realize this will doom humanity. Their solution is to go interrupt Coleridge's composition of Kubla Khan -- which in the story is a poem based on the ghost's story, explanation, and request for help. How does this stop Wenton-Weakes and the ghost from fixing their ship? It clearly doesn't stop the ghost from possessing Wenton-Weakes, or from being released in the past (the protagonists say there are now two ghosts - the original one, and now also the one that returned to the past, and has been stuck there another eternity). And, of course, the change to the poem is billions of years later than the change-point where the ghost tries to fix the ship. (The book's prologue offers a clue - a visual that, in retrospect, we understand as some version of the ghost, crying in anguish at Coleridge being interrupted. But that's not very clear either.) 

Remembering that Tolkien was Catholic, I would suggest that the meaning is not specifically or simply death, but rather the ability to rest in peace after death -- which in Catholic terms means to be reconciled with God. Thus I think the import of Frodo's question is whether or not Bilbo has been irredeemably corrupted by the ring. Though Bilbo's passage over the sea would constitute his resting in peace, I don't know that I would go so far as to call this a deliberate foreshadowing. It is all too easy to find associations in any text is you look hard enough. I would want foreshadowing to we written in a heavier hand than this before I called it by that name. 

Edit: Language is English and it is all happening in US. That's all I remember. Any help is appreciated. 

I have read a book in the 90's, while I was a teen, but it is very likely it was published much earlier. I have been trying to find it on and off since. I do not remember character names. Sorry. Things I do remember: 

Emperor Beyond The Sea represents Yahweh, Old Testament God, The Father. Also, God of the Jews. Aslan represents Jesus and New Testament. Emperor indeed has a separate country (Israel, if you will) with his own people. You might say that he is beyond the Sea of Understanding or Knowledge; nobody can know his will or anything about him. In a way, Emperor is a hero of another story, a story that is almost finished. Being human god hybrid, Jesus is much closer and easier to understand than Yahweh; so it goes with Emperor and Aslan. Emperor is idea, far away from people's eye, unknown and unknowable. Aslan is there and approachable. That's my interpretation at least. 

The stories of I, Robot - and Asimov's robot stories in general - tend to circle around two central themes: 

A central concern of The Library of Babel -- and particularly this section of it -- is the search for order and meaning within a chaotic world. In this passage, Borges introduces the Purifiers; those who, in their pursuit of truth and meaning, destroy anything they consider of no value: 

The significance of the name "J.E.D.D. Mason" itself is a crucial plot point in Too Like The Lightning. "J.E.D.D." stands for Jehovah Epicurus Donatien D'Arouet - sacrilegious in our own day; even worse in the Seven Hives, where public mention of religion is forbidden. Madame D'Arouet explains that each of J.E.D.D. Mason's ba'pas picked out one of the names. 

I think we can reasonably infer that the work Lewis is referring to is The Works of Aristotle the Famous Philosopher, which, per Wikipedia, is a sex manual and book of midwifery, falsely claiming to be the work of Aristotle. In other words, a work of pretentious smut. Just the sort of thing that Lewis liked to rail against. So, the answer is: Smutty bookshops. 

Surely the point is that we don't know. When a civilization ends, what comes next? If the previous civilization began with a birth in Bethlehem, then whatever comes next symbolically repeats the pattern. But when all we see about us is the fall of the old, how would we know what comes next? And so the question: what rough beast? 

So, the cyclical book is God in the context of "what the mystics claim". The phrasing is a little ambiguous. It could imply that one of the mystics' claims is that there is a cyclical book, and another is that this cyclical book is God. Or, it might be the narrator's opinion that the cyclical book of which the mystics speak, is in fact -- in some manner -- God. The separation between the claim of the circular room, and the definition of the book as God -- particularly, by saying "their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure," which obviously isn't the mystic's own claim -- makes it seem like a remark by the narrator. So the easiest way to read this is, the narrator is mentioning a belief of the mystics, and pointing out that in the context of their beliefs, the cyclical book is God. You could interpret that as, for example: 

Schadenfreude. Francisco hates government planners and policy makers. He likes to see them fail. But what is it that he finds amusing? He knows something they don't know and he knows people better than the planners and policy makers. If they knew that thing, they wouldn't have done it. I'll try to explain with an analogy. Person A is preparing a surprise party for Person B. It is talking about preparations to person C. Person C claimed to everyone that person A is a bad party planner. Person A likes strawberries. Because of that, you can say that party is strawberry themed. Strawberry cake, strawberry juice. Even the punch bowl has strawberries in it. Thing is, Person B is allergic to strawberries. Person C knows that, Person A doesn't. Person C finds it amusing not to tell Person A about the allergy and can't wait for the surprise party to fail, so C can take B for a beer after the ruins of that party. 

That is the tale he is planning to tell at parties later in life, but, as the previous lines have made clear, these sentiments are all bosh. There was nothing to choose between the roads and he has no idea if the choice he made made any difference at all. The problem with the poem seems to be that most of the readers get so caught up in the romance of those last lines that they fail to notice the plain statement that they are a piece of humbug. The words "with a sigh", particularly, emphasize the humbug of the words that follow. Why will he sigh? To make his words seem vaguely tinged with regret. It's an act. It is humbug. But we can't see it because we want the particular piece of humbug to be true. We want poems to have poetic ideas and poetic themes and the road less travelled is just what we think a poetic theme should look like. So obviously the poet must have meant those words seriously, and so the rest of the poem -- which if read plain is making it clear that those sentiments are humbug -- becomes difficult and mysterious because the conclusion does not seem to follow from them. Which is, I suppose, as good an illustration of the purpose of literary criticism. Not to elucidate some hidden meaning about forging your own path in life, but to point out that it is, on the plain face of it, describing not some momentous life choice, but the kind of humbug we tell ourselves and our friends about the significance of our choices.
