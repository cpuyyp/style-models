A 4 month time frame is not enough time to analyse, design, produce, and ship the necessary modules to adapt the generation ship to support human life. The existing Mars missions are probably designed with regularly scheduled resupplies, and extensive monitoring from an Earth based mission control in mind. They wouldn't be suited for repurposing for supporting a populations for multiple generations. To put things in perspective it took 8 years to launch the Mars Science Laboratory after the initial request for proposals. 

Sanitation won't spark an industrial revolution. It is neither necessary nor sufficient. A modern understanding of sanitation is unnecessary to start an industrial revolution. Given that the Industrial Revolution was considered to have ended sometime between 1820 and 1840 and the Broad Street Cholera Outbreak happened 1854 in London we can safely assume that adequate sanitation did not exist throughout the Industrial Revolution. The capabilities to build a system of piped water and covered sewers existed as far back as Rome. Building the system would promote economic growth and improve the quality of life for the inhabitants of the town but would not lead to any of the innovations iconic to the Industrial Revolution. 

Splashed with water Exposed to the heat Touched by a human or stabbed by one (in the latter case- do they bleed or does their blood boil away?) 

As a bonus question, would there be a difference if the Titanian was radiation resistant or would the results be the same? I ask since I am not really certain how to predict any of this. 

My current model of how to achieve this is as follows: 1- A interplanetary vessel is built in Earth orbit using reusable rockets descended from the likes of Falcon 9. 2- This interplanetary vessel has living space, propulsion and a solar sail (since that's totally all you need for a mission as complex as a manned interplanetary venture, right?). 3- Attached to the interplanetary vessel is a shuttlecraft designed for flying in low gravity, atmosphere lacking environments since planes wouldn't work on Europa. On Titan, it'd make sense but Europa isn't a jovian moon known for its thick atmosphere. 4- This shuttlecraft is manned and deploys both the encampment (using modular bubblehabs that can be dug into the ice for radiation protection- this is Jupiter so radiation is an inevitable issue) and the submarine that needs to be able to descend all the way to the bottom of Europa's ocean... And back. 5- Said submarine is able to gain energy from the hydrothermal vents if needed (and maybe even ride the convection current back up) and can supply the crew in said sub for about a Month with food. Oxygen in the sub can be derieved from the sorrounding water. The submarine is modelled partially on a bathoscaythe, however it is very simple in shape (very capsule-like, but with a heat drill on the front that likely can double as a defensive weapon encase a sea monster tries to eat it). There are also communication systems and some deployable aquatic probes for sample collection instead of arms like current bathoscathes use. Deploying a human in pressure suit gear might also be possible if the story demands it. However, I have a feeling that a pressure suit for Europa would be somewhat expensive (I state as I detail out a high-tech submarine and a manned space mission more ambitious than anything in human history up to this point). The problem I have is i'm not sure how expensive or massive all this stuff would be. My intuition is that being a manned mission carrying a ship that can deploy both a encampment and a submarine which 4 people can reasonably man is that it'll be a big ship, but i'm not sure how big. The Delta-V of going to Europa, orbitting and going back with a manned vessel also will be pretty intense. The speed of the ship on average would be 5x faster than the Juno Probe as well, putting it at a drifting speed of around 370 km/s. That is about a thousand times slower than the speed of light but still really damn fast. However, assuming no fusion energy how would getting to this speed on the scale of say, weeks be feasible? Gravity slingshot around the Earth? I come here since I don't know anything about the logistics of space travel and want to see how many holes can be picked in it and what I should use to fill those holes in. And also because this is likely going to be insanely difficult to pull off and the more information I have on what would be needed the better, especially in regards to the mass of the three crafts, what prolusion systems to use and how to better structure the time frame of said mission. Also tell me if 16 people is too much or not enough. I just picked the number out of superstition more than anything else. Since it's in 2057 the tech doesn't nessecarily have to be current day, but i'd prefer the tech still be based on or descended from technology in research or on the drawing board today more or less. Fusion energy is off the table, for instance. (As for the life itself, that's all spoilers. It's not Europa native but evolved in Europa-like conditions with the magnetic field of the nearby gas giant, acidic seas and the 'right' balance of tidal stress. The inhabitants didn't become space faring independantly, they gained space age technology from a much more distant entity and technologically degenerated in the thousand years they lived on Europa. They surveyed Earth early on but their ability to speak a human language is likely non-existent beyond a few words. Not to mention they speak more like whales or dolphins than humans. I mention this to anyone who objects to advanced life on Europa here, even if this is not the focus of the question.). 

Fabric was extremely time intensive to manufacture. Pure white was almost impossible to get in fabric. You can get six pairs of white athletic socks for $9.99 from Costco. Everybody needs clothes and a clean pair of white socks would be seen as a luxury. 

Medically I don't see any reason why not. There are already a couple different long term reversible contraceptive methods available to women. These include intrauterine devices, hormonal implants, and hormonal shots. There is promising research into similar long term methods for men. It's important to remember that there is a failure rate associated with every birth control method, and that not every birth control method is suitable for all individuals. If the government invested in contraceptive research and worked to pair each individual with the contraceptive method that worked best for them the success rate of such a program could be quite high. 

Be able to enter and return from the subglacial abyssal ocean in Europa. Have a crew of 16 people. (12 people for the surface and 4 people for the submarine) Be able to have both a surface encampment and a sub-surface exploration mission. Be able to retrieve samples back to Earth. Cost less than 250 billion dollars (if unattainable give me your own estimate) Have a travel time of around a year to Europa (those poor bones...) 

This is somewhat vaguely related to a old question of mine involving a alien species who spend three thousand years developing a post singularity spaceship armada in the mantle of a lava planet (Industrious). I try being realistic. So realistic that I figured that might somehow not work as planned. My logic at the time was so sound too! "Can't hide in space because of heat signature? Well, let's find some extremely hot place and hide in it where looking for heat signatures is impossible and no one will look anyways". Turns out trying to make a massive underground base in a lava planet has lots of problems. Problems that you can only throw so much technology at. So I wonder. Where in the galaxy is a safe place to hide from some genocidal spaceship entities who wanna kill everyone? And I mean anywhere in the galaxy. Empty space is not a option, too easy to be seen. Cold planets I presume would be useless because of the lack of heat. However, where in the Milky Way galaxy is a safe place to hide from swarms of genocidal aliens that kill anything they detect on sight while building a giant space fleet? -Will a lava planets work? -What about a hot jupiter? -What about near the galactic center? -Are globular or open clusters good or do they come with problems like being too much of landmarks? -Do red dwarfs or brown dwarfs hide things well enough or are they too cold to hide heat signatures? Technological limits are very few here, but hyper-spatial options aren't available. FTL speeds are around 10-20 Ly per day. Wormholes would require moving to other star systems if used. 

If feathers get in the way of manipulating objects your intelligent tool users will evolve to not have feathers on their hands long before they develop the tools and culture necessary to not cut feathers as a indicator of wealth. Congratulations you've discovered fingernails. These days humans can do all sorts of fancy things with our nails if we aren't doing manual labor. We have only reached this point after a long period where every proto-human was needing to work with their hands and manipulate objects constantly for survival. Note for instance that we have less hair on our hands relative to the rest of our bodies. 

Not sure which one would be the most logical or thematic, but the general idea should be the same. A currency that has its weight not in gold, but in a celestial object of arbitrarily defined importance. The issue is I have no clue if using a cosmic object as a currency weight would actually work in practice given the expansionist nature of my human civilization. Since I am not really good at economics, can anyone who knows their economics tell me what unintended implications of this idea may entail given the scenario and/or celestial object used? I'm not completely sure where to look. *Detail: The "special particle" in question is called the "Lux Particle". It exists only in the corona of stars and must exist in plasma. Lux Particles allow ships to not only have FTL, but also fast-as-light travel and teleportation for spaceships. Brighter stars have more lux. I might have intentionally devised lux as a way to screw red dwarves over. 

It's impractical. The technologies to make the device work didn't exist in the middle ages, and it doesn't add value over a traditional bow withing the context of the medieval battlefield. The purpose of archery during medieval battles was massed fire into infantry formations. The auto loader contains only four arrows. Archers were expected to fire more than four arrows before reloading. The reload time seems to seriously reduce the effective rate of fire. Medieval English longbows had draw weights upward of 150 lbs. A compound bow greatly reduce the strength draw a but the bow in the video had a much lower draw weight. Compound bows are a modern invention first created in 1966. They are are built to take advantage of many modern innovations like precision machining, carbon fiber, complex pulley arrangements, and aluminum. Furthermore the construction of the mechanism relies on multiple elastic bands. Elastic bands didn't exist as a medieval technology. 

What would a typical user use such a network for? Well we talking about interplanetary internet so the user will (want) to use it for what we use it today. 

I assume with static you mean you cant post or change things, but you will still get the latest info, like the mysterious disappearing of yourself in the local news. A way to archive this: Your smartphone is no ordenary smartphone, it has special designed OS and automatically generate a VPN to your cooperation instead of your normal access to the internet, you access it through the cooperation firewall. However your cooperation has the policy that posting is not allowed. Any HTTP request other then GET will be filtered. And maybe some other popular Sites. While this would not completely prevent the ability to influence the internet, it could be enough for your story. You would still appear in the logs, everything that uses get to transmit data will work (unless the firewall has some special rules to prevent this, because it is a relay good firewall), but that doesn't mean your character knows this or find such services. Some company also have the rules of no mails on holidays, which would prevent you from writing emails. Maybe after some time someone will notice that your character access the network, and starts communicating with him. Or he will be trapped forever. 

It is 2057 and a manned mission to Europa has been comissioned in the prospect of further exploring the ecosystem and energy signatures of Europa. Unlike the implied unnmanned probe, this mission logistically has to be able to do the following: 

Recently i've read Worldbuilding by Stephen Gillett and one thing that struck me was that for one reason of another many of the alien worlds lacked the resources needed for metallurgy. However, the book also mentioned how crystals would be common on at least a couple of these worlds which made me start thinking. Could a advanced species develop on a acidic world (even with less energy available) that instead of using metals, uses crystals, clays some other material in the place of iron/copper and has to advance on very different lines from humans with their steel and silicon chips or those other aliens with their calcium rich bioships and moldy circuitry? Crystals and clays according to the book would be in abundance on the acidic worlds (which is a generalization- the author goes through nitrogen-oxygen worlds, worlds with chlorine rich atmospheres where plastics instead of cellulose is used for wood and sulfur rich worlds, all of these worlds he concludes would lack in iron/copper. Therefore leaving any civilization that develops on a acidic world with chlorine or sulfur all over the place 'In the stone age'. I am skeptical of this simply because is metallurgy really the end-all be-all to even consider technological civilizations? It seems like it is on Earth, but that's more or less because metals are attainable and iron is easily available. But on another world where that's not the case could some other technological base exist and could it still be possible to make a advanced civilization through some alternative form of conductors? Crystals and clays to my knowledge both have diverse applications, but is it possible for them to fill similiarish technological niches seen in the modern world at least in the fields of automation of labor and/or computing?
