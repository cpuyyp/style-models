Reference: Lang - Differential manifolds p.123 Quick question: Lang defines the cotangent bundle as the dual vector bundle of the tangent bundle, but shouldn't there be additionally a somewhat canonical differentiable structure on the cotangent bundle? (Or does the dual vector bundle naturally determine the differentiable structure?) How do I define such canonical differentiable structure? Let me illustrate my approach in detail below: Let $X$ be a Banach $C^k$-manifold. Define $C_p(X)$ as the class of $(c,v)$ where $c=(U,\phi,E)$ is a chart at $p$ and $v\in E$. (Note that $U$ denotes a coordinate domain and $\phi$ denotes a coordinate map and $E$ denotes a Banach space where $\phi$ is mapping to) Now, define an equivalence relation on $C_p(X)$ as follows: $((U,\phi,E),v)\sim((V,\psi,F),w)$ iff $D(\psi\circ \phi^{-1})(\phi(p))(v)=(w)$ Define a map $\mathscr{O}_c^p:E \rightarrow C_p(X)/\sim: v\mapsto [(c,v)]$. Then, it can be shown that $\mathscr{O}_c^p$ is a bijection. Using this map, we can isomorphically give a vector space structure on $C_p(X)/\sim$, and this structure can be shown independent of choice of charts $c$. Let $T_p(x)$ denote this set equipped with the natural vector space structure. Moreover, we can homeomorphically give a Banachable topology on $T_p(X)$ using those maps $\mathscr{O}_c^p$. Now, define $T_p^*(X)$ as the collection of continuous linear functionals on $T_p(X)$. So that $T_p^*(X)$ is a Banachable space too. With these terminologies (which are standard as far as I know), let's define the cotangent bundle. Define $T^*X:=\bigcup_{p\in X} (\{p\}\times T_p^*(X))$, and let $\pi^*:T^*X\rightarrow X$ be the map such that $\pi^*(p,y)=p$. Let $c=(U,\phi,E)$ be a chart of $X$. Define $\mathscr{D}_c ^p:T_p^*(X)\rightarrow E^*: A\mapsto A\circ \mathscr{O}_c^p$. Note that this map is linear homeomorphism. Define $U^*:=(\pi^*)^{-1}(U)$, and $\phi^*(p,A)=(\phi(p),\mathscr{D}_c^p(A))$ for each $(p,A)\in U^*$. Now define $c^*:=(U^*,\phi^*,E\times E^*)$. Then, $\phi^*:U^*\rightarrow E\times E^*$ is an injection and $\phi^*(U^*)=\phi(U)\times E^*$ is open and $E\times E^*$ is Banachable. Hence, $c^*$ is a chart on the set $T^*X$. Take the unique differentiable structure generated by those $c^*$'s, and call the set $T^*X$ together with this differentiable structure the cotangent bundle of $X$. Would it be the correct one? 

Metric dimension is well-defined The usual definition of metric dimension (and the one initially given in the OP) is the smallest cardinality of any metric basis. This generalizes the notion for metric dimension in graphs and is well-defined for any metric space (finite or not). To see this let $(M,d)$ be a metric space and $\mathcal{G}$ be the collection of metric generating sets. There are two natural posets one can define on $\mathcal{G}$: let $P_1 = (\mathcal{G}, |\cdot|)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $|G| < |G'|$ and let $P_2 = (\mathcal{G}, \subset)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $G \subset G'$. Note that the minimal elements of $P_1$ are the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$. Also notice that the metric bases are contained in the minimal elements of $P_2$ and that this containment is generally strict. Metric Bases and Matroids Fix a metric space $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a finite set. Let $r$ be the metric dimension of $(M,d)$. Since the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$ of $(M,d)$ all have the same cardinality one can ask if and when $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of bases of a matroid. Recall that a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of (finite) sets is the set of bases of a matroid if it satisfies the following exchange axiom: for every $B,B' \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $e \in B$ there is some $f \in B'$ such that the set $B \setminus \{e\} \cup \{f\}$ is also in $B$. First let's see that there are some finite metric spaces whose metric bases are the bases of a matroid. Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected connected graph and let $d: V \times V \to \mathbb{N}$ be the map that takes a pair of vertices to the length of the shortest path between them. Then $M(G) := (V,d)$ is a metric space. A simple computation shows the following fact. Fact: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple connected graph with $|V| \le 4$. Then the metric bases of $M(G)$ are the bases of a matroid. This fact does not extend to all graphs with $|V|=5$. To see this consider the graph $G = ([5], \{13,14,15,24,25,35\})$. Then $M(G)$ has 22 metric generating sets and six metric bases $$\mathcal{B}(M(G)) = \{12, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34\}.$$ Notice that for $B = 12$, $e = 2$, and $B'= 34$ there is no element $f \in B'$ such that $B \setminus 2 \cup f$ is also a metric basis. So the metric bases of $M(G)$ are not the bases of any matroid. This graph is unique among simple connected graphs on five vertices in that it is the only one whose metric bases are not matroidal. Let $f(n)$ be the number of the simple connected graphs on $n$ vertices and let $g(n)$ be the number of such graphs whose metric bases are not matroidal. We used these Macaulay2 scripts to compute $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ for $n \le 7$. 

as is well known, we can put a metric on the upper half plane $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}$ by setting $$ d\left((x,t);(x',t')\right):=\log\left(\frac{1 + \delta}{1 - \delta}\right)^{1/2}, $$ where $$ \delta := \left(\frac{(x'-x)^2 + (t'-t)^2}{(x'-x)^2+(t'+t)^2}\right)^{1/2}. $$ My question is: what is the most elementary proof that this is indeed a metric, meaning that the triangle inequality is satisfied? Elementary means that no geometric arguments can be used (e.g. from hyperbolic geometry). Thanks for your answers! Edit: I am looking for computational solutions which do not make use of any invariance property. 

The Stiefel Manifold is defined as $$ \mathrm{St}(p,n):= \{ X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p} :\ X^T X = I_p \}. $$ Recall that the tangent space at a point $X\in \mathrm{St}(p,n)$ is given by $$ T_X{\mathrm{St}(p,n)} = \{\xi\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}:\ X^T\xi + \xi^T X = 0 \}. $$ Given a point $X\in \mathrm{St}(p,n)$ and a tangent vector $\xi \in T_X{\mathrm{St}(p,n)}$, it is possible to express the exponential map $\exp_X(\xi)$ using the matrix exponential function. A formula is given in the paper www.mit.edu/~wingated/introductions/stiefel-mfld.pdf . My question is whether the inverse $\log_X(\cdot): \mathrm{St}(p,n) \to T_X\mathrm{St}(p,n)$ can also be expressed using the matrix logarithm. A related question is the following: Instead of the exponential function one may define other retractions such as $$ R_X(\xi) = (X+\xi)(I_p + \xi^T\xi)^{-1/2} $$ or the closest point projection $$ R_X(\xi) = \pi(X+\xi), $$ where $\pi$ maps a matrix $A$ to the closest element in the Stiefel manifold. This projection can be easily computed using SVD. Again, the question is wheter one can find simple formulas for the inverses of these retractions. Any helpful comments would be greatly appreciated. edit: at this point I do not really care which metric is used (the Euclidean metric or the one inherited from the orthogonal group). 

In his unpublished article, Combinatorial properties of triangulations of oriented matroids, Julian Webster proves that every triangulation of an oriented matroid is partitionable. Does this result appear somewhere in the published literature? If so, where? Edits: 

Let $U$ be the uniform matroid of rank $k$ on $n$. Since $U$ is orientable one can consider the Lawrence oriented matroid $\Lambda(U)$ associated with any orientation of $U$ (the Lawrence construction doesn't care about which orientation you take). Then $M(n,k)$ is precisely the underlying unoriented matroid $\underline{\Lambda(U)}$ of $\Lambda(U)$. Also, the dual matroid $M^*(n,k)$ is a symplectic matroid, which explains why the group $B_n$ acts on the primal. 

Webster himself does not know if this result has been published elsewhere. Two excellent resources for triangulations of oriented matroids are Triangulations: Structures for Algorithms and Applications in the realizable case and Triangulations of Oriented Matroids in the general case. Neither of these sources discuss partitions of triangulations of oriented matroids. A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is partitionable if there is a function $\phi : F \to \Delta$ on the facets of $\Delta$ such that the set of intervals $\{[\phi(f), f]~|~f \in F\} $ is a partition of the faces of $\Delta$. 

Given a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, I am looking for a symmetric matrix $S\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that $$ S A + A^T S = I $$ $A$ can be assumed to be regular (with positive determinant, if this is of any help). The difficulty is of course that $S$ must be symmetric, otherwise one could simply take $2S = A^{-T}$. In principle this is a linear equation with $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ unknowns and this can be solved for $S$. Is there a nicer way to find $S$ such as a closed solution formula using some factorization? Has this problem been studied anywhere? 

I have the following question. Assume we have a Riemannian manifold $M$ with the induced metric given by $d$. I am looking for a canonical way to compare two elements $v,w\in T^n M$, where $T$ denotes the tangent bundle of a manifold. For instance, for $n=0$, we can compare two elements $v,w\in M$ by $d(v,w)$. For $n=1$ we can compare two elements $v,w\in TM$ by parallel transporting the vector $w$ to the basepoint $\pi(v)$ of $v$ and setting $D(v,w):= d(\pi(v),\pi(w)) + \|v-\tilde w \|$, where $\tilde w$ denotes the result of parallel transport of the vector $w$. This is how far I get, for $n=2$ I cannot think of a natural way to compare two points. Is there a natural notion of distance on $T^nM$ for $n>1$?
