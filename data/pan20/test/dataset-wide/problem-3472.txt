My Approach Thusfar Without much time to find an appropriate theoretical framework or empirical model from the literature, I began by creating an ad hoc demand model using Poission regression, wherein The independent variable, Y = the number of enrollments in a given time period The independent variables, X included: 

This analysis is being conducted on the prospect and customer level (within-firm), meaning that we have data on customers and people who we've interacted with who may or may not become customers ("prospects"). Specific Details for Illustrative Purposes A close proxy for the specific type of firm at hand would be a chain of mixed martial arts studios. In addition to basic student demographics, we have the follow dimensions which may be considered: Class types 

You have $$ \begin{align}Â u(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b, \lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a) &= \sqrt{\lambda a + (1 - \lambda)b} + \sqrt{\lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a} \\ &\geq \lambda\sqrt{a} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{b} + \lambda\sqrt{b} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{a} \\ &= \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \\ &= u(a, b) \end{align}$$ The inequality in the second line follows from Jensen's inequality for concave functions. I don't think you need to prove Jensen but you can even do that moderately easy with the AM-GM inequality if you want to. 

I am yet a bit confused about the actual application of the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (or Baumol-Willig pricing rule) for a network monopolist $M$. What I know is the following. The ECPR determines the optimal access price $a$ which $M$ charges some downstream competitor for accessing its network. More precisely, it says that the access price is the direct (marginal) cost plus the opportunity cost of the monopolist $M$ which is also equal to the retail price minus the saved (marginal) cost of the incumbent for not serving the costumer at the downstream market himself. On the other hand, in my notes, there is stated that the access price should optimally be equal to the marginal cost for the operation of the network. And this is where I am confused as I don't know which would really be the 'efficient' one? Let's consider a simple example. Let's say there's some network monopolist $M$ that can also serve consumers at the downstream market with a product that is priced $p = 10\$$. The marginal cost for serving the consumers is $c^* = 2\$$ per unit. The cost for maining the network, i.e. for operation and such, is $ C = 5\$$. What would now be the optimal price that the monopolist charges a downstream competitor which would like to access $M$'s network in order to serve the consumer, having a marginal cost for selling at the markt of $c > 0$? According to what I first understood it should be $a = p - c^* = 10\$ - 2\$ = 5\$ + [10\$ - 2\$ - 5\$] = C + [p - c^* - C]$. But according to my notes, it should just be $a = C = 5\$$. What is correct and why? 

For the given answer, part 1a is saying that, since the company cannot earn interest on investments, it is better to just take the \$12k. However, one ought to know something about how this company discounts to actually answer this question. That is, one should make this comparison by comparing \$8,525 to the discounted present value of the \$12k, taking into account that the \$12k is received in payments spread uniformly over 12 years. The real answer to this question as written is, ' IT DEPENDS'. Part 1b is saying that $8,525(1+.07)^{12} \equiv 19,199.93 > 12,000$ and so the company should take the lump-sum payment and invest it. HOWEVER, this is again the wrong way to answer this question. Instead, one should compare $8,525(1+.07)^{12}$ with the money the firm will have if it chooses the \$12k and subsequently invests each annual payment. This value is \$19,140.64 (link to calculate). The answer here is correct but for the wrong reason. 

I currently deal with interest rate theories, reading amongst others Paul Samuelson (1958) and Peter Diamond (1965). In Samuelson the possibility of a naturally occuring negative interest rate is introduced due to consumption smoothing and without some central bank mechanism. Often times I heard (or read) that the interest rate is impossible to decrease below zero as soon as some commodity is introduced that preserves its value over time, like land or some kind of neutral money. What I don't understand is, why? What is the idea behind that and what kind of concept is this neutral money as opposed to "traditional" money? 

This is a very poorly written question. The gist of the question is this: should a company take a lump-sum payment from a customer of \$8,525 or a \$12k payment that is spread uniformly over 12 years. The thing the question wants you to consider between 1a and 1b is that in 1a the company cannot earn interest (which the answer just assumes is compounding) and in 1b the company can earn 7% interest. 

I will frame this in the context of modern monetary policy and for the sake of clarity assume we are discussing the American economy. 1) Whenever the Fed wants to bring about some change in the economy, they do so by using one of three tools: open market operations, setting the discount rate, setting reserve requirements. I will only discuss open market operations. The Fed recently introduced two new tools: interest on excess reserves and forward guidance. I include these to be complete. 2) The Fed conducts open market operations through its NY branch's buy/sell desk. In simple terms, the Fed can buy/sell securities in the open market. This causes two things: a change in total bank reserves and security yields (by way of shift demand/supply curves, for example). Your question is whether or not it makes sense to think about an increase in the money supply causing an increase in interest rates. Since we want to discuss increasing the money supply, let's assume the Fed is buying securities in the open market. Whenever the Fed buys securities, it buys securities from banks and 'pays' the banks by 'adding excess reserves' to the banks' balances at the Fed. Total reserves in the banking system rises. All else being equal, banks have more money to lend. This increases the available supply of loanable funds. Since we assume demand for loanable funds is unchanged, and since interest rates are the equilibrating force in this market, we should see that interest rates drop (because the supply curve shifts right/up). You might also want to think in therms of what is happening to security yields. If banks start buying a large amount of securities in an effort increase the money supply, we should see a large increase in demand for securities. Assuming all else equal (in particular, assuming that there is no change in the supply of securities) we should see yields on securities fall (this is equivalent to the purchasing prices of securities rising). And so we see that the logic, whenever we consider either adjustment mechanism, points toward a fall in interest rates whenever the Fed increases the money supply. With this in mind, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the paper you've cited gets it wrong. And as a point of fact, we have witness recently (during QE) that money growth is not necessarily inflationary...as counterintuitive as that might be. 

I am again running into problems with regard to expected utility and utility of expectation. This is very similar to this question I posted a few days ago. Since it did not clear the matter then I post this as a separate question as it is placed, I think, in a more general setting. This time I don't care about income but about prices. The question is as follows. Let $C(x) = cx^2$ be the cost function for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$. The output price is $p_s$ and variable according to the scenario $s$. The utility of the firm is given as $u(\Pi_s) = \log(\Pi_s)$ where $\Pi_s$ is the profit in scenario $s$. Now there are two scenarios. In the first, the price is $p_1 = \bar{p} + z$ with probability $w$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}$ constant and in the second, $p_2 = \bar{p} - z$ with probability $(1 - w)$. Derive the optimal output $x$ if the agent has to decide for the quantity before the price is known. In my opinion, there are two ways to solve this. Either I set up the first-order condition separately, i.e. $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = w \frac{(\bar{p} + z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} + z)x - cx^2} + (1 - w)\frac{(\bar{p} - z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} - z)x - cx^2} = 0$$ which is quite cumbersome to solve for $x$ afterwards or I compute the expected price $p^* = \mathbb{E}[p] = z(2w - 1) + \bar{p}$ and then solve $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = \frac{p^* - 2cx}{p^*x - cx^2} = 0$$ for which $x$ would then just be $$x = \frac{p^*}{2c}$$ What I don't understand is which approach should I use here and, in particular, why? I am familiar with vNM-rationality and the expected utility maximization context but I cannot see which one beats the other and what is the theoretical argument there: expected utility of possible prices or utility of expected prices? 

I will expand this into an answer since I've had a chance to look at a bit more of the literature on price salience, which I consider to the primary consideration here. That being said, I think there is something to say about the fact that the company might do away with a pricing policy that some subset of potential customers feels is deceptive. This will obviously lead to a more positive perception of the company (from these customer types). Whether or not this positive increase can offset the impact of increased price salience is an open question. My original comment: One must also consider the antithetical effect that price salience has on purchase decisions. It might be the case that people are more likely to tolerate a product's price ex-post than they are ex-ante. There is a robust literature on the effect of salience on elasticities and prices (for example, Finkelstien's tax salience paper). This definitely doesn't settle the matter but it does inform whatever answer you ultimately accept. Her paper: economics.mit.edu/files/7878 Other papers to read: Bordalo and colleagues: $URL$ This paper looks at consumer choice and characteristic salience of goods. This is a good paper to help build an intuition of what I mean by salience and what it means for a good or a good's characteristics to be salient. Dias et al: $URL$ This is a paper about how price salience impacts consumer perceptions and purchase intentions. I added this paper because I think it hits the nail on the head here. Also, it gives a good review of the literature that is most related to your question. Hope this helps. 

In class we dealt with insurance economics and, specifically, adverse selection due to information asymmetry. As one possible solution we considered pooling contracts, i.e. the same contract for both high- and low-risk households for some average price. We showed and I understood why the high-risk households now would buy more insurance than the low-risk ones and thus everybody would act as if they were low-risk whether this is true or not. What I am not sure about is why there wouldn't be an equilibrium in a competitive market. It's clear that the low-risk individuals have reason to go for a lesser premium and, if some other insurer would offer this, then they would go there. Therefore, my questions are: 1) So why won't there be an equilibrium? I would think that if a new insurer appears with a better deal than the pooling contract, then there would again be the problem with adverse selection. Hence, the new insurer wouldn't appear and offer a better deal in the first place? 2) I also read that this is pareto-inefficient in that it disadvantages the low-risk households (obvious) but does not benefit the high-risk households. The latter point I do not understand since the high-risk households will have a higher demand since the pooling contract situation makes the insurance relatively cheap. Isn't that a benefit? 

General Description of the Problem As is common in microeconometrics, I have a situation wherein a decision maker seeks to analyze returns from promotions (promotions meaning various forms of discounts, not advertising, in this case) with the objective of selecting a promotion strategy which maximizes profits. Given several practical constraints, in terms of 

I'm reading Matchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms by economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee. They describe how businesses often make a rational choice to allow one side of their "matchmaking" business to be the "subsidy side", i.e. the side paying a negative price, and the other side to be the "money side", as in the side that pays fees to the business. Here "matchmaking" means serving as an intermediary that lowers the transaction cost of connecting 2 or more populations, such as Visa connecting shoppers and retailers. For example, PayPal pays (or used to pay) consumers for signing up for the service, so they're the subsidy side. Businesses typically pay the fees and are thus the "money side". Is there an equation, formula, or inequality that describes how the business chooses which side to treat as the subsidy or money side? 

Currently I am trying to figure out some old problems for an upcoming micro exam. One of them is about production under uncertainty. The exercise seems standard to me, yet I am not sure whether I have the correct solution. The question is as follows. A firm produces goods with the cost function $C(x) = cx^2$ where $x$ is the good. The price $p_x$ is exogenously given. The utility function of the producer is given as $u(y) = \sqrt{y}$ where $y$ is the income due to profit. Determine the optimal amount of produced goods $x$ in case i.) $p_x$ is deterministic and (ii.) the price is random where it is $p^0_x$ with probability 0.5 and $p^1_x$ with probability 0.5. How will the output change if there is some future price $p^f_x > \mathbb{E}[p^s_x]$? My solution is as follows. First, we have that the firm's profit is $$G = p_xx - cx^2$$ and its utility $$ u(y) = \sqrt{p_xx - cx^2}$$ Now under deterministic prices the firm owner wants to maximize expected utility, hence $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[U]}{dx} = (p_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p_x - 2xc) = 0$$ and therefore $$x = \frac{p_x}{2c}$$ In case of random prices the optimality condition is now $$ \frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}((p^0_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p^0_x - 2xc) + (p^1_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p^1_x - 2xc) = 0$$ right? After that I have to solve for $x$ and I got the result. Finally, if there is some future price which is higher than the expected price I am not quite sure how to proceed. Intuitively, I'd say that if the owner would produce more goods but how would I show that in an analytic manner? 

Your production function is linear in its one input [case number 2 above] and so it exhibits constant returns to scale. That is, the answer to your question is yes. 

So, there are two ways to answer your question, I think. 1.) For this type of graph, where one agent has linear preferences and the other has curvilinear and convex preferences, it is easy to see that the locus of P.O. allocations shifts toward the right edge of the Edgeworth box. Thus, corner solutions run along that edge across the range where points of tangency are no longer interior. 2.) If you encounter a situation where, for example, both agents have linear preferences, you can use the directionality of the strict inequality to identify along which edges of the Edgeworth box you have P.O. allocations. An example for 2.) : $U_1(x_1,y_1)=X_1+2Y_1$ and $U_2 = 2X_1+Y_1$ Now, you should do the following:
