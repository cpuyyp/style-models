No, because fresh rainfall has no salt in it, so as long as the river keeps moving the salt has no time to accumulate. Only stagnant sources of water on land, like lakes with no outlet, can become saline. 

I used to live in San Diego and I remember the occasional wild fire; My dad standing on the roof, watering it with a garden hose. I have lived in New England, however, for the last 40 years and have not seen a wild fire yet. Why not? Just too wet here? 

Is there any way to get barometric time series for regions of the United States? I know that barometric maps are widely available, but in my case I want to see a time series for one region. However, I have not found any comprehensive source for weather time series data including pressure readings. Does that exist? 

My understanding is that it is difficult to measure the amount of radiation the earth receives to the sun and that due to variability in a number of different quantities such as the changing distance to the sun, the tilt of the earth, and the variable amount of radiation emitted from different parts of the sun's surface, it is not currently possible to measure solar irradiance. Is this correct? 

Japanese legend claims that typhoons twice save Japan from attempted invasions by Kublai Khan, once in 1274 and seven years later 1281. These divine winds ("kamikaze") are mixed in Japanese mysticism and are perhaps apocryphal. The Chinese were meticulous record keepers and recorded disasters of all kinds. Liu et al. scoured written Chinese history for records of typhoons. T earliest unequivocal report of a typhoon they found was in the “Official History” of the Song Dynasty: 

The IPCC reports is always a good start. The most recent is the fifth assessment report. The site I used to make the above map, Global Maps from GHCN v3 Data is also a good source. 

The most obvious difference is that as the name implies, the ERSST includes data from over the oceans. These data are gathered by buoys, ships, and satellites. A not so obvious difference is that NOAA's merged land–ocean surface temperature analysis incorporates GHCN-M land-based stations that are not used in the GHCN-M land-only map. The locations and ages of the 7280 Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) stations are depicted below. Note that the vast majority of the stations in Africa are less than twenty years old.

That's certainly one factor that makes Mauna Loa an excellent site for this kind of study. This Skeptical Science page lists some others: 

Your question is quite similar to one that I asked some time ago, with the additional requirement that the glue be insoluble in water, which unfortunately excludes sodium and potassium silicate. Like you, I've found Ceramabond (albeit 571, not 569, in my case) to be too magnetic. I suspect that there's an element of random variation here. It's not (as far as I know) specifically formulated to be completely non-magnetic, so there may be some batches which are more magnetic than others. Khakhalova and Feinberg (2014) investigated some other high-temperature ceramic adhesives and found that they were also too magnetic for use with weakly magnetic samples. However, they do make one useful suggestion: 

In "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" by Jules Verne there is a reference to a "tempest" that destroyed Yeddo (Tokyo) in Japan: 

Gold is found all over the world. Where it happens to be most economic to mine depends on a range of random factors, including political factors. One big factor in gold mining is the cost of labor. Places where labor rates are low are more likely to have people mining gold. There are places in Africa where people dig up gold with their bare hands. There is probably plenty of gold left in California, but do you really want to restart hydraulic mining, washing entire mountains into mud to get that gold? Hydraulic mining was banned in California over a 100 years ago, but hey as long as you are willing to destroy every mountain in the Sacramento valley, we could start it up again and turn California into a gold mining district. 

This is based on the overly-simplified model of tides being the result of tidal bulges. As I explained in my answer to a related question on the physics.SE sister site, those tidal bulges do not and cannot exist. Instead, the tides are dynamic responses to the tidal forcing functions from the Moon and the Sun, with the orbits of the three bodies about one another, the Earth's rotation rate, and the geometry of the oceanic basins all playing roles in the dynamic response. For any point on the surface of the Earth's oceans, the tides can be described in terms of a composition of frequency responses to those cyclic forcing functions. See the related question Definitions of tidal harmonic constituents…? for details. At many places, Fiji included, the key component of the tides is the $M2$ tidal constituent, with a period of 12.42 hours. This is the principal response to the tides induced by the Moon. If Newton's equilibrium (tidal bulge) theory of tides was correct, every oceanic place on the Earth's surface would see high tide when the Moon is at zenith and nadir, and low tides when the Moon is at the horizon. Except for a few places, this is not what is observed. In Fiji, the situation is nearly reversed, as depicted by the tide chart below for Nadi on the west coast of Viti Levu, where high tides are more or less in sync with moonrise and moonset. 

I understand the process of volcanism and the reason for magma deposition on the surface of the earth. What is not clear to me, or what seems to be less well explained is why eruptions occur and then stop. What is the operative cause or causes of a flow to start or stop? As far as my understanding goes there would seem to be two possible obvious explanations: (1) The magma rises in bubbles, like a lava lamp, through the earth, so the flow begins when the bubble reaches the surface and stops when the bubble is exhausted. (2) The magma rises as a constant stream, but causes earth to build up around the stream, eventually snuffing it out by mass accumulation. In this explanation, the lava constantly searches for thin spots where it erupts until it blocks itself off, then the pressure forces its way through some new location. Are either or both of these explanations correct or incorrect? Is there a mechanism I have not considered? 

An oddly specific question, but quite straightforward to calculate. Let's start by calculating the volume of your slice. I'm taking values for the inner core's physical characteristics from this Wikipedia page. 9 inches is ~0.229 m. Radius of inner core: 1.21e6 m We'll approximate your slice as a cylinder: even if we imagine the inner core is a textbook sphere down to the centimetre scale, its curvature would be miniscule over such a thin slice. $\pi \times (1.21 \times 10^6)^2 \times 0.229 \approx 1.05 \times 10^{12} \,\,\mathrm{m^3}$ So the volume of your slice is around a trillion cubic metres -- about one-fifth of a Lake Michigan, if Wikipedia is to be believed. Now we just need to turn this into a mass: Density of inner core: 12800 kg/m³ $12800 \times 1.05 \times 10^{12} \approx 1.348 \times 10^{16}\,\,\mathrm{kg}$ So, roughly 13 trillion metric tonnes. As jamesqf points out in a comment, this calculation just takes an estimated average density for the inner core, and assumes that this is the constant density throughout. In reality, the density increases with depth. Kennett (1998) gives a model for this density gradient.
