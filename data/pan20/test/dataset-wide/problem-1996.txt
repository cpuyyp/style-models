The "tell me about yourself" question is usually just used by interviewers to gauge your social/conversational skills. There really isn't a right or wrong answer for it, but since you are seeking a job at the company, use that question to your advantage. You can tell them about about what you studied in school, what skills you have, give them a brief summary of all of your previous jobs, and then tell them how your skills and experience are a good fit for the position. Remember what skills and other requirements they mentioned in the job ad, and if you have those skills, be sure to mention that. I wouldn't bother with mentioning any personal hobbies or interests, unless they are relevant to the job. For example if you like to work on open-source software projects in your free time, then definitely mention that. But don't waste the interviewer's time by mentioning that you like to go horseback riding or anything that's not related to the job. "Tell me about yourself" is such an open-ended question that it's a great opportunity to tell them your skills and experience and to sell yourself for the job. It's the best question you could ask for in an interview. I've interviewed many people and asked that question, and a few people seemed intimidated by the question and didn't know what to say. They really blew a golden opportunity to tell me why we should hire them. 

You'll also have to consider the company's arena and their fiscal year; for example, a company that survives through online sales is likely to add staff some months before the holiday sales hit, to tweak their site for the reality that most retail-type sales occur during the 6-week holiday period (this year, it's down to less than 4 weeks, though, which should make for possible poor retail performance. Companies will also hire for the coming fiscal year, which often means that opening are approved in December -- but so few people are in the office in December that the hiring usually starts at the first of the year. In addition, it's very likely -- but not guaranteed -- that when a company is adding jobs in one area, they're adding in another; i.e. expanding IT jobs will usually suggest expanding accounting, sales, marketing, etc. More to the point, though, you're going to find that this isn't consistent even with a given company; it depends on more factors than can be generalized.

Resumes tend to get "stale" and once they have open positions, they will tend to look at the new resumes first. There are some exceptions where companies will enter resumes into a database, and actually search the database when they have open positions; however, that's not as common as you might hope, and almost all new positions are going to be advertised in some way. If you do submit your resume to a company rather than for a targeted job, do so during the start of one of the more likely hiring periods ... i.e, the first few weeks of January, and right after Labor Day, can work well if new jobs are being created. After Labor Day, you'll also have the advantage of any summer hires going back to school, leaving openings in companies that hire students and new grads. Oh, and while you're waiting for that optimal time to submit your resume, look for specific job openings, and get your on-line info up-to-date and appealing; as a contract worker, I get a lot of contacts from linkedin and careerbuilder, without much extra effort, mostly because my particular work experience contains the right keywords. 

Assuming you are still interested in the position, then I think you should email the manager, but not to say "thank you" for preparing to speak with you. Instead, you should email him/her and say that you are sorry that you didn't get a chance to talk to him/her during the phone interview. Express your interest in the position, and make an offer to set up another phone interview with him. As the hiring manager, he/she would surely like to get to know a person who will potentially join his/her team. Obviously he/she will find out about you by speaking to the person who conducted the phone interview, but nothing beats talking to you directly. I think offering to speak with him/her in another phone interview will impress him/her with your initiative and indicate that you really are interested in the position. 

No, you should not bring this up. You are correct that it could be an issue, a liability, but it's never good form to be intruding into your co-workers' habits. You don't know if he has an arrangement that allows for this, and you are not his boss. It's offensive when employees try to clock other employees. It's never productive, and it puts you in the position of judging someone else's work habits. Unless it -directly- affects you, stop watching the other guy, and just make sure you do what you are supposed to do. 

Many companies in the US do not freeze hiring. 1. Well -of course- hiring varies by industry and arena: You don't really think that construction is busy hiring in December, or retail sales in March, do you? Take a look here for historical numbers by month: $URL$ The differences are easy to spot when you look at, say, Jan 2012 vs Sept 2012, even though the general patterns are similar. There's a nice analysis on monster: $URL$ 

Absolutely you should send in another application for the new job listing. It is perfectly normal for someone to send in multiple job applications to a company, if that company has multiple jobs that the person is interested in. There is nothing desperate about that. The hiring manager probably receives a lot of applications for each job listing, so he probably won't even remember that you applied for the previous position. You don't need to mention that you already applied for the other position. 

It's no problem to make your own business card. There are plenty of companies that don't even issue business cards for their full-time permanent employees. You need a way to give your contact information to people you meet at these seminars and events, and the business card is the easiest way to do so. I think it'd be a good idea to put your employer's name and your title on the business card, that way people know you're employed and that information could help them to remember who you were when they look at your card. You can also include your company's phone number and your work email address, but since you say you're a temporary employee, it'd be a better idea to include your personal phone number and email address. That way people can still contact you after you leave your current employer. EDIT: Your manager doesn't have a problem with you attending those events that he forwards to you (otherwise he wouldn't forward them to you), and it wouldn't hurt to ask him if the company can make some business cards for you since you would like to attend those events. Also you can have two sets of cards if you prefer (one business and one personal), but only give one of those cards to anyone you meet, otherwise they might be confused about how they should contact you. 

No, it is not common. But the reason for it is that it costs the company money to put together an offer, and they have to also inform other candidates that they have chosen someone else. The purpose is primarily to cut their risk. I'm not sure I'd be too thrilled with a company that played that particular game, though, unless they had at least outlined the potential offer to me ahead of time, so I could compare it with others and decide if they really -were- my first choice. 

Another way to look at it is to consider whether that activity might be something you'd want treated as a business if it's profitable. You can't deduct your hobbycrafts costs if it's just a hobby, despite being required to report the income; if you want to deduct the costs from the income, then you have to define it as a business. The same applies for those selling on Amazon: to deduct the costs of doing business from the income produced, you must file the very form that acknowledges it's a business. When working for others (such as a non-profit) as a volunteer, it becomes an "occupation" if you have identified responsibilities, a consistent role, or any of many other aspects that show that you function as regular employee (even if unpaid and part-time.) But when in doubt: Ask the other party. They might even give you permission to do something outside of the contract terms. 

Employment applications can ask for a variety of things of interest to the company that wouldn't be on a resume. These can include the following: 

Next time you walk by his desk and he's not there, look at the phone on his desk. If it has an LCD display on it, it might show his name. If not, it will probably show his phone number. Memorize the last 4 or however many digits you need to make an intraoffice call. When you know he's not at his desk, call his number and wait for his voicemail. (You'll probably want to make the call from a conference room phone so that his phone doesn't tell him he has a missed call from you.) Hopefully he will have customized his voicemail greeting to say his name. 

Your odds of getting a job that would bring you to the US are pretty low. But if you are already in the US, you have a few options. First, I'd suggest substitute teaching; it doesn't pay great, but technical types are always needed badly, and it would give you an entry point. Second, internship or entry-level jobs may work out if they're for an organization that will eventually have a paying job up your alley. Third, you really need to get back to school and refresh your background, if you can possibly afford it. There may even be special scholarships or funding for someone returning to school at this point in life. The most important thing I'd stress is that you need to show that you are keeping up with the times and are eager to learn. I'm older than you, but I get along with my highly-technical colleagues because instead of thinking "I'm too old to learn all that", I am eager to learn the latest technologies and hone my expertise. The hard part for you, I suspect, is that what you did academically is irrelevant, as is the last 20 years. It's going to be all about what you can do now, what you can contribute and what you can learn to do well that is relevant to today's world. Use all your energy to get started on it right away. If you need to go into a new field, well, there are a number of areas of software engineering that are always short of capable people; there are especially areas of web development that involve programming that's in demand. But don't go to a community college for "web design"; that will be useless. Instead, find a way to develop websites, even if you have to do it for free for a while, just to show off skills, and focus on programming -- Java first, PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc. -- see what's in demand. Thanks to the fear that companies have about discrimination lawsuits, if you can actually do the job, you are likely to land an interview if only as an "alternate" candidate. But you can't do it based on your past; you have to become a "now" person who is useful in 2013. Short of that, you probably could get a job at McDonald's, or something even less desireable. 

You made a correct statement. As an interviewee, you have no idea who the other candidates are and therefore you couldn't possibly know if you are the best person for the job. I think the interviewer was taken aback because he had probably never heard a candidate start off their answer to that particular question like that. There is probably a lot of people out there who try to inflate their skills and abilities during interviews. The honesty and modesty that you exhibited is not the norm, especially for a question like that where you have to sell yourself. Since you got the job, your preface obviously didn't hurt. I think it could have been a positive - the interviewer may have appreciated your honesty. It's not always easy for interviewers to tell if a candidate is being honest. 

In this specific case, I'd suggest avoiding taking it on yourself. Instead, simply acknowledge that it needs to be corrected. 

There is not as much to expose as you think there is. You are too close to the situation to see it in a detached way. "Whistleblowing" is all about companies doing illegal and/or dangerous things; this is about the simple art of deception, which many people feel is part of being a manager. The press is not going to be interested. Even your co-workers in other departments aren't going to pay attention to it. They will all assume that it's just "sour grapes" for you, and part of being in the business world. The reality, anyway, is that it's all about who you're listening to, who is making the statements you suggest were made. That's not the "company", it's individual managers who clearly can't be trusted. But you don't even know what pressures those manager were under to cut the people they cut; all you do know, at this point, is that they said they were sure that certain people would be retained who were not, in fact, retained. You don't even know for sure whether they believed themselves what they said at that point. For your own sake, just let it go and start looking for another job. No job is safe at that company, from what you describe; even your boss's boss may end up being replaced in such times. Get your mind off it and get your life away from there, because clearly anyone could be let go, and if the company is possibly on the verge of shutdown, it's going to be one of those that doesn't say so, that you'll find out on the day you come to work and all the doors are locked. 

I've never heard of this situation before. Since you will be rescinding your acceptance, it wouldn't hurt for you to ask them for the reason, but you may not receive a truthful answer. The only thing I can think of is that right after giving you the offer, the company found another candidate for the position who indicated they would accept a salary 10% lower than yours. The company decided to lower your offer by 10%, knowing that if you decline, then they will just hire the other person. Whether or not it's ethical, be grateful that they decided to reduce your salary before you quit your current job. Imagine how you would feel if you quit your current job, got settled in with this company, and then they gave you a pay cut.
