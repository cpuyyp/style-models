Most city states never grew past that stage because they limited participation to the citizens of the city. At some point these few thousand aristocratic families loose impetus and the decline set in. Rome was rather a mongrel city from the start, picking up its people from a mix of Latin and Etruscan folks. As a small state in a region with larger ones, gaining people was a higher value than clean bloodlines. So when they got the upper hand against a neighbor, they would offer the aristocrats in that city a chance to be Romans, too. When Rome set up colony cities, this also gave a way for lower class Romans to become upper class in the new city, and then upper class in Rome with time. This gave Rome a far larger population of loyal citizens to work with than, say Athens. The value of this was proved in the Punic Wars, when the Romans could lose battle after battle and not have the defections that Hannibal based his strategy on. Every city had a reason to stay loyal - they were part of the Roman core. If Hannibal one, they would be ruled from Carthage and have no such expectation. This continued into the late Republic and Empire. The Spanish that the Romans fought in 80 BC were becoming Emperors by Hadrian's time. The Illyrian tribes that were pacified by Augustus were producing the Emperors that brought the Empire back from the 3rd Century Crisis. The Eastern Provinces and Africa also were happily producing the wealth that allowed the Empire to grow to Scotland. Rome grew the most because it offered a way for all its peoples to help support it. 

Another important choice was in the the routes used by the merchants, which were selected according to the political stability of the regional power. Centralized states, confederations and regional powers promoted trade and diplomacy. They invested in communications and economic infrastructure such as secure roads, water depots, inns, reliable coinage, standard weights and measures. They imposed taxes on travelers and traders. The merchants found it wiser and safer to pay the controlling authorities for safe passage than to risk encounters with bandits. 

The cause of the Kargil war is deeply entrenched in politics, and a long history of conflict and competition between two countries. The full depth of the rivalry is well outside the scope of an answer here. But what must be categorically stated is that contrary to the claim above, religion has nothing to do with it. Post-Kargil, a research was conducted within the International Security and Defense Policy Center (ISDPC) of RANDâ€™s National Security Research Division (NSRD). NSRD conducts research and analysis for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Unified Commands, the defense agencies, the Department of the Navy, the U.S. intelligence community, allied foreign governments, and foundations. The purpose of the research was specifically to understand how India and Pakistan viewed the significance of the Kargil conflict, what lessons they drew from this conflict, and the implications of those lessons for future stability in South Asia. This was subsequently published as a book: . Their report states: 

Byzantium and Persia were both greatly weakened by titanic wars they had fought with each other during the reign of Heraclius - at one point Byzantium was surrounded, and at another Heraclius was taking Persia's capital city. But aside from that, there was a structural weakness in the Eastern provinces near where Islam was being born - the Monophysite Schism: 

This isn't the sort of question you find citations for, but the essence of Western Civ. starts with the Greeks. Much of Greek history lies in its interactions with the Persians and other denizens of empires and kingdoms in Asia Minor, the Levant, and Mesopotamia, so going back over the history of these regions is of interest. The Civilizations in Egypt are also if interest for the same reasons. And in the end, Alexander conquered the Mideast and Persia and introduced a dose of Greekness into the mix. So Sumer is of interest to Western Civ since it sets the stage for the East/West interaction that the Greeks had. Other states farther off that did not interact with the Greeks are not considered much - India, the Far East, Africa. These are studied in their own courses. 

However, only much later did "confession models" come to be studied, as psychoanalysis came into play. These included : 

Bankers, businessmen, landowners, nobles and princes all gave active support to the British. Indigenous collaborators and "traitors" such as Mir Jafar were key elements the British exploited to their own advantage. They promoted and demoted officials and bureaucrats to suit their ends. These are well recorded- the active support by the Jagat Seths and other bankers, the various nobility and princes. The history of this period is now seen as a mercantile expansion- and the role of money, the motivation for acquiring wealth are seen as important factors. So the social milieu, complex economics, dynamics of a center-periphery competition and the transition from agrarian to mercantile economy are seen as contributing much more to the equation- it is no longer viewed as a simple 'military expansion' history. Colonial history is therefore not a simplistic ruler-subject equation. Rather the British are seen as active participants in a greater and more wide-ranging transition. (This is notwithstanding the post-colonial lens which also views the construction of subject identities and many other 'epistemological violence' such as knowledge production.) For a very good introduction that refers to many other scholarly works, see this book. 

You could also call the supposition that aristocratic 'blue' blood was better than anyone thus justifying their privilege another superstition and one that an American might be more inclined to take issue with right before the Revolution. It wasn't King James I that was the problem, but the entire English ruling class, founded on the aristocrats. 

Since this is a speculative question, I'll add mine. Romania is singular among regions in East Europe in that it is guarded on three sides - and the sides facing the directions that barbarian incursions would come - by significant hills and mountains - the Carpathians. This shield could help buffer them from attacks and from cultural influences from neighbors more than a more easily crossed border would. Bohemia, in central Europe, has a similar border facing west and north and also has a distinct cultural difference from the Germans across the border. 

Farming in the Han Dynasty was initially based on the Qin Dynasty model, i.e small farms using some irrigation and fertilization. But mostly they matched crops to natural soil conditions, and therefore relied on a limited number of crops. But during the two Han Dynasties, new crops were added: several cereals, beans, rice, barley, oats, wheat, millet, vegetables, hemp, indigo, sesame, mulberries, and gourds. The farms became well organized and productive, and crop rotation and intensive agricultural techniques and implements were developed. Irrigation systems were developed. 

To clarify- this was cited not as the sole research that says torture is ineffective. It is simply the "backstory" that the counterview can effectively counter: 

Just as in the elections themselves, what actually went on in the USSR did not necessarily match what the rules and law said was going on. People might be cautious that if you weren't seen voting, there would be consequences no matter what the law said. 

The problem with the Thesis in Gun, Germs, and Steel is that we have one example of an E-W megacontinent (Eurasia) and one example of a N-S one (the Americas). Africa is a bit small, and vague on E-W vs N-S. The Island comparison probably fails due to the small size of any island, so the different terrain zones are similar. 

My question is: are there any other examples of enclaves solely for protecting people of mixed descent? By I mean something that did not grow due to influx or settlement, that is, without a laid out charter. 

Arjuna: The hero of Mahabharata also changes gender. Urvashi cursed Arjuna when he refused her advances, that he would become a "kliba", or of third gender. Arjuna used this as a disguise during his last year of exile, taking the name Brihannala and living as a woman. Vishnu: Changes gender and becomes "Mohini" (the enchantress) to trick the demons into giving up "Amrita" the nectar of immortality. Vishnu as Mohini became pregnant from Shiva, and gave birth to Ayyappa. 

Unlike a city wall, that has people always around it to man and guard it, a free standing border wall tends to get stripped of manpower whenever the attention of the state building it falters. An unmanned wall isn't hard to get around, or over. I've even read that some believe the main task of these border fences is less to hold invaders out, than to keep raiders in. A raiding party can cross over easily enough alone, but when laden with loot and prisoners, the wall crossing back will take long enough that the mobile security force will catch them in the act and be able to capture the raiding force, or at least make them abandon their gains. 

Some of the oldest known languages in the Indian Subcontinent were Pali, Sanskrit, Brahmi, Prakrit. Prakrit definitely predates Sanskrit, but Sanskrit was popularized as a "marga" or "higher" language by the monarchs at a certain point after the "Aryan" influence. Several scripts too were known, such as Kharoshti, derived from Aramaic. The Indus Valley "script" has not been deciphered. None of the older languages are in use today. Regional languages as we know them today were later developments- some well into the 11th century CE. These languages were derived from both the Sanskrit as well as Dravidic roots. Tamil, Kannada, Telugu show greater Dravidic roots than say Hindi, Bengali, or Oriya, which show greater Sanskritic influence. Sanskrit, however, is still studied by many for academic and religious reasons. By inference, smaller groups of specialists also study the other archaic languages. But these are not in use even to the extent that Sanskrit is. The division of states on the basis of language is a post-independance phenomenon, and has been cobbled together from many kingdoms, princely states, British Presidencies and other non-linguistic political divisions. While it has been criticized by many as "divisive", others have hailed it as a successful experiment.
