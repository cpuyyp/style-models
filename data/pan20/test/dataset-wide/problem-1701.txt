You could add another "link in the chain" as it were.. put an ntop box between the wifi and the internet, it will show you graphically, everything.. fantastic software! $URL$ 

Which "previous question" would that be? I assume when you connect your 3G device, it automatically overrides your default gateway, which you can check by using the command line and typing: 

Apparently can be done with ICAP Server: $URL$ The client is in squid3: $URL$ Config from above: (squid.conf) 

POP3 is a protocol, Exchange is an MTA, which can deliver mail using many protocols, it defaults to MAPI for user mail retrieval, but you can enable IMAP and POP3 (and even X.400) And it includes a webmail interface. (Which allows mobiles/iphones & remote users to access email). The webmail interface (when configured) allows users with broken Outlook to stay productive anywhere in the world.. ;-) 

Profit? Can't figure out how to write the rules that would do this.. maybe you'll would have more luck. 

From fixya.com Connect to the console port via hyperterminal or similar. Then, at the command prompt... (hit enter twice!) 

Yeah, that is a very confusing question. I guess, if you had to do it, you could enable "audit logging" using the NTFS tools on your windows server for those XML files.. assuming the aspx script loads them directly.. if they are loaded remotely.. dunno. If they are loaded from the page, then the requests should appear in your IIS service logs. 

I am having trouble running my command to create a file screen for each drive that contains a share. I have to run this on a lot of servers, any ideas? Here is where i am at now: I can create a file screen if i manually enter the path in this first line. But I need to automate that, each serer will have different shares. 

But when I create an action to run my power shell script I cannot figure out how to add it to the template, or just a file screen. This is what I am using currently, how do i apply it to a template or file screen? 

So i realized that all the space between c:\users\ and Public was just white space. So i edited my list to remove all the white space after each username and after that it works. 

I know this question is old but it helped me get to the correct solution. I solved this problem by ensuring i had the corresponding adml language file in the en-us folder. I would make sure you have the terminalserver.admx in your policydefinitions folder. 

I had to create an account at the teradici website, their website just says its in binary format, but they do provide a script in python to convert it to a pcap. KB2484. The script says i'm not allowed to post publicly so I wont do that. Link 

We have an offsite hosted email server, which works (but is slow), and all our users connect to it to receive email. Internal users connect to my postfix server to send email, I want to leave that there and create a new email server that can act as a inbound relay (Not sure if that is the correct term) so that internal users can connect to it instead of the remote one: 

No, no you aren't. By using MAPI internally, you keep the email on the server, and can back it up centrally, and can use public folders to share contacts/messages/todo/calendars etc with multiple users easily. I guess thats it, someone better can probably answer your questions more fully, and I look forward to reading their answers! 

Process explorer might be better, allows you to identify which module is in error, where its stuck in the stack, memory/net/etc.. (doesn't stream past like a log-viewer, more like task-manager with better options!) $URL$ MS kb/555021 suggests your profile might be corrupt, try creating a new one. 

CentOS uses rpm packages, binary equivalent to RedHat, so you can use standard RH weapons to access the files in the packages: 

This has a helpful example: $URL$ Uses php to parse the fifo and shunts it to browser... then ajax to refresh 

I have a powershell script to capture a screenshot. If Run it in powershell or ISE it runs fine, takes the screen capture without issues. When I schedule a task on windows Task Scheduler it just saves a blank image instead of the screen capture. Any ideas why? Script: 

I have a Domain Controller that for some reason beyond me has ADCS installed on it. The domain controller is a 2008 R2 server and needs to be demoted, but first I need to do one of two things. This same server also runs DHCP, NPS (RADIUS server),and other third party software. My Options (according to me) 1. Migrate ADCS to a different server (it would be a new machine with 2012 R2). $URL$ 2. Spin up an offline non-domain joined root CA and have a live domain joined issuing CA. I would then backup ADCS on the domain controller, revoke any issued certificates and remove the server roles. It would seem that for option 1 to work i need to migrate the computer name and IP as well. If I go with option 2, what steps can I take to mitigate the possible impact. Currently the CA has issued 9 certificates. However, only 3 have not expired, 2 of those expire in the coming week, the third one a year from now. What would be the best way to get ADCS off this domain controller? 

Its called a "Mandatory Profile": $URL$ Apply whatever settings you want to the profile, rename the .dat to .man, then, when creating accounts in future (or modify existing), set the "Profile" field in the accounts properties to that profile's directory. (The link above shows how to set this path) 

Note, multiple RewriteCond directives are implicitly AND'd, you need to specify if they should be OR'd instead. If you want the browser to remember the redirection, specifying a permanent redirection might save some future processing. Depending on your config, it might be easier to specify the Known Good ranges and redirect for everyone else. From the rewrite manual on redirecting foreigners: Apache Manual 

Pretty sure, you can then just manage your clients from within the LDAP database, with all the API's that work with it for automating MAC->IP lookups etc.. Each DHCP server can refer to the LDAP global database for single-point-of-contact administration. 

How did you configure the basic auth? If you are using Directives, try changing to instead. (as the proxied requests don't actually touch an Apache directory.. Edit: I assume you have: 

You should be able to configure RRAS to relay DHCP from your DHCP server, that way all the dns suffix's that you have configured locally would be propagated. Routing and Remote Access -> server name -> IP Routing -> General Right-click General, and then click New Routing Protocol. In the Select Routing Protocol dialog box, click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click OK. Edit that new DHCP Relay Agent object, and add the IP address of the DHCP server. Then, Right-click on server name and select the IP tab, choose DHCP, ok! Works a charm. 

Alright I just had to prevail a little longer but I figured it out. I changed my for-each statement to the following: 

It seems to me like the script is running but not capturing the screenshot when run through windows task scheduler. The saved image is just one white page. Does anyone know why this is not working? 

Unless someone has blocked outbound/destination ports to (specifically 8530) your clients should not have any problems checking for updates from your WSUS server. You may inadvertently be blocking the client connections on the WSUS server itself. Even if by default port 8530 is open, I would verify by testing the WSUS server for port 8530. You can use Putty or another telnet emulator to connect via telnet, just change the telnet port to 8530. If the connection is successful then and clients are unable to connect to and get updates from WSUS then you have other problems. Give this link a try WSUS Troubleshooting. 

I have this foreach statement that goes through a list of usernames and puts each name in the path listed below, then it copies and pastes a file to the individual users startup folder. For some reason i get an error that a portion of the path was not found. Any ideas what the problem could be?
