David L. Jeffrey cites "The Raven" as an example of an ironic use of the phrase, while retaining the biblical association: 

Wikipedia says that the Balm of Gilead, speaking figuratively, is a "universal cure," and Les Harding writes: 

Monique Sarfati-Arnaud similarly argues that the story, and this particular aspect, communicates the irresistibility of the power structure of society: 

The maiming that Henley had undergone was the amputation of his left leg below the knee (not to the hip as in Silver's case). 

These short interludes are interspersed in Urania's recounting of her most tightly held secret, but I don't recognize any real pattern. I suppose it's possible that Vargas Llosa simply wanted a light way to interrupt the story, but I suspect it's more than that. What is the purpose and/or meaning of Samson's interjections through this crucial part of the story? 

This is precisely what appears in this passage in The Last Battle. Aslan repudiates Tash and his wicked followers, so this isn't universalism. But despite following a false god, Aslan saves Emeth, because of his good motives and good will. 

Brenci Patiño makes the point that the two women, Modesta and the indigenous woman, are "pitted against each other" by the social structure around them. They "share similar experiences of oppression," but must fight each other for survival. Modesta, as a servant to a wealthy family, was abused and made to live in fear. So the specific incident, in which Modesta demands payment from the indigenous woman, Patiño attributes to the replicative power of societal norms: 

In the final chapter of La Fiesta del Chivo (The Feast of the Goat), Samson the parrot plays a recurring role. Here are a few examples: 

Doris Alexander, in Creating Literature Out of Life, devotes a chapter to Stevenson's creative process in this book, and therein quotes a letter from Stevenson to Henley: 

C. S. Lewis can be fairly described as a Christian Inclusivist – he believed that Christianity was true, but was not willing to claim that only "Christians" would be saved. This is different from universalism – though not his favorite doctrine, he did believe in the existence of hell, and that some would go to it: 

As opposed to Christian Exclusivism, in which saving knowledge of Jesus Christ is necessary for salvation (cf. Westminster Confession of Faith 1-1; John 14:6, Acts 4:12), Lewis (and many others) take what they consider a more hopeful approach – that some, though not knowing about Jesus Christ or not explicitly following him, will nonetheless be saved (cf. Mark 9:40, Acts 17:23–28, 2 Peter 3:9, etc.). Lewis makes this position more explicit in Mere Christianity, using the example of "a Buddhist of good will": 

The narrator is arguing that misery is always valid, no matter the pretense, and ends by stating with a smug sort of nihilism, "All that we see or seem / Is but a dream within a dream", i.e. life is ultimately a meaningless illusion whether one spends it in misery or happiness. However, in the second stanza, the narrator seems to begin doubting himself. 

One thing that immediately struck me on reading the poem is how the two stanzas seem to form an argument and a counterargument. The first stanza ends with the assertion "All that we see or seem / Is but a dream within a dream", while the second ends by questioning that assertion: "Is all that we see or seem / But a dream within a dream?" I interpret the first stanza as the narrator bidding farewell to someone as they die, someone who basically thinks the narrator is wasting his life: "Thus much let me avow — / You are not wrong, who deem / That my days have been a dream". Given the next few lines about losing hope, it seems the narrator has spent a good portion of his life being hopeless, miserable, and melancholy, on what the dying person seems to think are thin pretenses. The narrator quibbles with that: 

"The temptation for farandola or for man or for star is to stay an immature pleasure-seeker" (Chapter 10, p. 203), but growing up, though it includes its share in the grief, also includes its share in the joy, its privileges that an immature pleasure-seeker cannot have. Meg understands this now that she's become more mature: conforming to the system takes away some of her scope to be different, but it allows her to stay with Calvin, and to go off to college and find a fulfilling career like her parents have done. 

As well as several more times afterward. My immediate thought when I first read Chapter I was that it symbolized his lack of empathy (i.e. metaphorical blindness to the feelings of others), which led his sons to revolt and throw him out, but he does seem genuinely sad that his wife, Myratana, has died. Also, the arc of the story didn't seem to quite fit this reading. His lack of empathy doesn't seem to ever come back to bite him in a straightforward way: he gets exactly what he wanted, killing all his children with his curse; his brothers Ijim and Zazel remain in exile where he put them; and he dies as he wanted, cursing his own father, Har, for creating one set of laws meant to apply to everyone. Aside from the rebellion of his sons, everything pretty much seems to go his way. What does the blindness signify? 

Okay, I found a book which is reasonably similar, however it was published in 1983 and doesn't include an old man. It is called Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Here is the plot summary from Wikipedia: 

Could this be it? It seems to be a reasonably famous book (Cover says over 2 million copies sold) so it might be something your library had. 

I understand that Beatrice is basically saying 'I would rather X than hearing a man say he loves me.' But I don't understand the dog barking at a crow bit. What does a dog barking at a crow signify? I did some research and found that a crow is a bad omen, so perhaps the dog barking is warning the owner of a bad omen? 

The optimal search path is to start in the black circle and follow the black line. Supposedly, this will help you find him as quick as possible. A few other tips that I used: 

Throughout the entire Harry Potter series, there was one character who was the comic 'bad guy' - designed to be disliked. This of course is Snape. We think that he is a Death Eater, working for Voldemort, with a personal disliking of Harry. However, in the final book in chapter 33 'The Prince's (Snape's) Tale', that all changes. Our entire view of Snape changes, and we learn he isn't who we thought he was. He wasn't working against Dumbledore and for Voldemort, but actually the other way round:

This quote was of course from the Christmas hating Ebenezer Scrooge. However, if we quote this as coming from Dickens, someone not familiar with his book may assume that Dickens hated Christmas, which we have no evidence for. He may have written the words, but it isn't his quote. He is giving the words to a character. But if we quote it to Ebenezer Scrooge, again someone not familiar with the name may assume they are a real person. So it seems we can't just quote one or the other. Someone made the point that if the character is really famous we can just quote their name, but that's not true. Not everyone will have heard of a character, and someone else made the point they wont be as famous in a couple of hundred years. There have been discussions similar on english.se and writers.se, but none give a definite answer. However, one of the answers gives a link to this site. It reaches the conclusion at the bottom that: 

In both poems, other people chide the narrator for dreaming instead of living in the present, and in both poems the narrator defies them, but in "A Dream" the narrator asserts a greater truth to be found in the dream, and chooses to dwell there as a way of preserving the goodness in his life: 

He's most likely being sarcastic. I'm having trouble finding anywhere else where the cat uses that kind of direct sarcasm, but such sarcasm definitely fits with the style of ironic verbal abuse that comprises most of his narration: 

On a deeper level, the pair of "The Lamb" and "The Tyger" can represent a person attaining an adult, intellectual understanding of God and the nature of the world. God loves the little children, his little innocent lambs frolicking in their fields and knowing not how to do evil. To them "He is meek & he is mild". He is the God of love from the New Testament, who "calls himself a Lamb" and "became a little child". But the adult is closer to the tiger, capable of war, killing, and sin more broadly; and sometimes sinful adults meet the Old Testament God who smote Sodom and Gomorrah, the vengeful and destructive force who "smiled his work to see" when "the stars threw down their spears / And water'd Heaven with their tears". The second stanza also offers some support for this reading: 

The phrase “twist the sinews of thy heart” in stanza 3 alludes to rope-making, like the ropes used in siege machines or to restrain the cannons of Blake's time when on-board a ship. Stanza 4 describes a forge (the furnace where the tiger's brain was crafted) and other blacksmith's tools (hammers, chains, anvils). Next come the two lines in question: “When the stars threw down their spears / And water'd heaven with their tears”. The previous stanzas implied a process of technological advancement, starting with the Promethean theft of the fire, advancing to rope-making, and then using the flame for metallurgy. The Tiger, a machine of war so fierce that not even the stars themselves could stand against it, is the culmination. But in something of a twist ending, Blake reveals in the next two lines that the Tiger is not a human creation: “Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” The immortal hand or eye that dared frame the fearsome Tiger is the same benevolent creator who made the innocent lamb from “The Lamb”. This leaves one question: why, specifically, the stars? Because it helps set up the “twist ending”. The first four stanzas, describing the tiger's creation, allude to a human creator with the reference to Prometheus and the mentions of physical body parts, such as shoulders, hands, and feet, and human tools such as hammers, chains, and anvils. The stars are clearly beyond all human power, but lines 17 and 18 imply that a human might have created something capable of overcoming them until the “twist” in lines 19 and 20. (I'm putting “twist” in quotes because it's not terribly surprising to anyone who's read “The Lamb” and recognized the parallel structure of the two Songs books, though line 20 does contain the explicit callback to “The Lamb”.) This study help page says the two lines about the stars “may refer to the casting down of the angels after Satan rebelled against God”, which would make “stars” a metaphorical term for angels. This interpretation, when taken with lines 19 and 20, also helps set up the “twist”. Now we can interpret line 19, “Did he smile his work to see?”, as asking whether God, upon defeating the rogue angels, making them throw down their spears and weep as they were cast out of Heaven, smiled and took pleasure in his victory at war. In this light, line 20, “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?”, becomes an allusion to the dual nature of God, who, to the poet's disbelief, is both the loving, gentle being who made the innocent Lamb, and the vengeful, warlike being who made the vicious Tiger and smiled to see his defeated enemies weep. 

We learn all this when Harry sees the memories he gave him just before he died. This is possibly the biggest twist in the entire Harry Potter series. It shocked many, and seems completely unexpected. But maybe it shouldn't have been so unexpected... Was there any evidence prior to the revelation that Snape is actually a 'double-agent' and not who we thought he was? 

I believe the story you are after is the short story The split cherry tree by Jesse Stuart written in 1939. I found this by searching 'story boy father school teacher microscope' and it was the fourth or fifth hit. I read the story and as I couldn't find a good conclusive summary online I wrote one myself: 

A halter used to be a rope for hanging people - a noose. Nowadays it has evolved to be a strap around a horse's head, but you can still see the original 'rope around the neck' idea. DLosc in the comments below points out that it used to mean a strap round a horse's head, and became a noose when hanging was introduced in the middle ages. This website pins the strap round the horse's head meaning to Saxon times, and the hangman's noose to mid 15th century. See here: 

A computer scientist named Randal Olson actually worked out an algorithm of how to find him. There are 68 total pages to look in across the 7 books - and by plotting the locations he made a heat map using Kernel Density Estimation: 

221B Baker Street. One of the most famous addresses in literature. But why? Was there any reason Sir Arthur Conan Doyle chose this particular address as the residence of his famous protagonist? Did he have any links to that part of London? EDIT: I've been told the house didn't exist at the time, but the street existed, and maybe the number 221 has other significance in his life. 

The character deserves to be connected to words they say, it defines who they are as a character. But we don't want to give the idea that they aren't fictional. But a character usually does not express the ideas of the author. So we can't just say the author. The best, and in my opinion fairest way to say both, and the novel. In your example, the quote should go as follows: 

EDIT After some comments, I'm going to clarify and expand on a couple of different contexts. If all the audience know the character If the audience definitely knows the character (e.g. If someone goes to a book meeting after everyone's read a book) then you can probably just quote the character. The audience will know they are a fictional person. If you are quoting multiple times The first time I would go with character, book, author. After that, the reader will know that the character isn't real, and you can just quote the character. If the character is used as the author's 'mouthpiece' Sometimes authors write a sort of biography, but use a character instead of themselves. In this case, and if you have to be absolutely sure this is the case, it would probably be best to quote the author, as that is their thought, not the character's. In all other situations Include all the information, author, character and book. If one person doesn't know the character is fictional, then you need to include all information, at least the first time.
