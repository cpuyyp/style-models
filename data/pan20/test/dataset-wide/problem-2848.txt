I think you might be torn between two different kinds of arguments. There's the explicit deductive statement: "X, Y is bad. Therefore X is bad." This is plainly a logical fallacy because the consequent simply does not follow from the premise. However, there's also the inductive statement: "X,Y is bad. X brings us closer to X,Y. So X is likely to be bad." The latter kind of statement doesn't directly impose the properties of X,Y on X based on a false association. It also cannot be a logical fallacy because it doesn't presume to make a deductive statement. It's an inductive statement, so that's when we can argue about things like probability, and render our opinions. That kind of statement can still range from reasonable ("it's bad to own a a gun without training because you might misfire") to ridiculous ("if you get a gun without training you might go into an unconscious ballistic trance and commit a mass-murder against your will"), but in neither case is a logical fallacy committed. 

There seems to be a confusion in the way you're phrasing the question. It is true for all moral systems that their imperative is imposed (almost) entirely upon humans. However, contrary to what you seem to be asserting, it's not true of all moral systems that the subject of their obligations is entirely humans. (In fact, it's not even true often.) In your hypothetical scenario where you're the only human alive, there are plenty of moral systems that would still apply to you, because the subject of their obligation is not necessarily humans. However, they would only apply to you because humans are still the object of those moral codes. Examples of moral systems that don't always impose obligations towards humans: -Western religions consider actions that are an affront to God to be immoral. This includes cursing in his name, according to the Jews, or desecrating a holy book, according to Muslims. -Utilitarians, such as Peter Singer, according to his book "Practical Ethics", believe that we have moral obligations towards animals that can be considered self aware and aware of their potential future. As do many vegans. So if your question is why are humans the subject of moral obligations for all moral systems, the premise is wrong. You can still ask why humans are the object of (almost) all moral obligations for all moral systems. As it stands, we never had a situation in which we ought to apply moral obligations to non-humans because we cannot practically impose a system of justice towards such. We can pragmatically account for the way non-humans behave, such as wearing protective gear against bears. However it is practically useless to come up with a system of ethical codes for bears to follow, which is based on concepts of deterrence or retribution. I did say "almost" all, because even then it's not true that all moral systems have only humans as the object of their code. You can consider a system in which the behavior of a pet is rewarded or punished with the intent of a Pavlovian response system to be a very rudimentary form of a moral code. As well, a new burgeoning field in philosophy is surfacing called machine ethics, which is primarily concerned about the ethics of AI. If we anticipate a society in which many of the rational actors will be AI, there is obviously a need for an ethical system to be imposed upon them. 

In the 16th century Europe, Skepticism became fashionable. Specially some forms of Pyhrronic Skepticism, which sought to undermine all knowledge in general (as in Agrippa's De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum atque artium declamatio invectiva, and Francisco Sanches' Quod nihil scitur). Pierre Gassendi, a rival of Descartes, was a moderate Skeptic. So were the people in Gassendi's circle, which Mauro ALLEGRANZA refers to. In his Meditations, Descartes sought to reply to such Skeptic concerns. Though assuming at first that he knew nothing, he nonetheless couldn't doubt he himself existed. Armed with this, and with a revived ontological proof, he aimed at turning the Skeptic's game against itself. By starting from absolute uncertainty, he would arrive nonetheless at truth, winning back the whole world which he doubted at first. These are most likely the "irreligious" people he was referring to. 

The argument for the uniformity (or homogeneity, or self-sameness) doesn't follow from the boundedness of what is. Parmenides introduces both uniformity and the argument for uniformity in the passage you're citing. The argument is: 

Over the course of it's history, western philosophy introduced all these distinctions between an object and it's class. But I'm a bit confused by this, because these all look very much alike. So what is the difference between them, besides their names and who named them? For instance, are "tokens" thought to be inherently concrete, while philosophical species need not be so? I mean, an actual bird ("token") classed within a biological species ("type") is always concrete, whereas the class of primates ("species") within the class of mammals ("genus") is thought of as an abstract thing. Or do universals have a larger extension than the other concepts? For instance, particular properties of different objects might be grouped into a universal, as I believe humorist pharmacology did when they grouped the different degrees of "coldness" of particular substances, which in salads causes people to feel refreshed but which in henbane causes death, into an universal "coldness" (unfortunately, I haven't thought of a less dated example). But the typeâ€“token distinction doesn't seem to be applied to properties and the classes of properties, but only to objects and the classes of objects. So what is the difference between all of these? 

The subject matter of the natural sciences tends to be a) observables and b) the theoretical objects required to explain them. So, for example, how the brain processes sensory information would be a scientific issue. The subject matter of philosophy tends to be significant abstractions. Traditionally, these include values (aesthetic and ethical), reality, knowledge, and logic. However, there are other significant abstractions that philosophers study, including the nature of science and political theory. So, for example, what we mean when we say that we know something would be a philosophical issue. Philosophy and science can inform each other. For example, a philosopher studying epistemology (theory of knowledge) can profit from scientific information about perception. And, frankly, scientists who have announced the death of philosophy could profit from reminders that this conclusion doesn't follow from any scientific findings. However, philosophy and science can never replace each other. Natural science, for example, doesn't commit us to any particular claims about truth or knowledge. If scientific theory A explains all of the data that scientific theory B does, and more data in addition, scientific theory A wins. That's it. Whether the theory constitutes a better approximation of the truth, or whether the traditional concept of truth is bankrupt, is a matter for philosophers. Philosophy, for example, can't tell us a damned thing about which model of the Big Bang explains the most data in the most parsimonious way. That's a matter for scientists. There is some confusion in the scientific community about what philosophy is, because the subject matter of some disciplines, such as neuropsychology, used to be objects of philosophical speculation. But there isn't any reason why modern scientists should cling to a eighteenth & nineteenth century concept of what philosophers do. 

To make a long story short, Bishop Berkeley argued that the idea of matter existing independently of perception was incoherent, since the properties of matter are (or were in Berkeley's time) defined in perceptual terms such as hardness, redness, etc. Hence, Berkeley's conclusion that "to be is to be perceived." Of course, Berkeley knew that there is a world beyond human perception, but since he argues that being is being perceived, he concluded that there is a Great Perceiver, God, responsible for what we call the external world. Thus, Berkeley's argument addresses two major philosophical issues: the problem of the thing in itself (solution: there is none) and the existence of God (there must be one in order for the external world to exist). However, modern physics has led to a description of matter that--it seems to me--need not reference perceptual properties at all. In fact, matter has properties that not only lie beyond our perception, but literally can't be imagined in perceptual terms--mass, charge, "charm," "strangeness," (the latter two being names for properties of subatomic particles), and more. Has physics thus undermined Berkeley's idealism, or has it merely prompted refinements in the arguments of the few modern idealists? 

Depends on the probability distribution and the sampling procedure. If your samples are IID then no, it is impossible. IID is an acronym for "independent and identically distributed". The "independent" part means that the probability of draw for a given sample doesn't depend on the outcome of any other sample. (E.g. rolls of a die or flips of a coin are independent. Picking a card from a deck is not independent, because it depends on what you drew from the deck earlier. Picking a card from the deck with constant replacement and reshuffling after each draw is independent.) "Identical" means the probability distribution from which a sample is drawn is the same for all samples. For example, two separate rolls of a 6-sided die is considered two identically distributed samples. If you roll a 6-sided die and an 8-sided die, these rolls are independent, but not identically distributed. It's easy to prove that infinite IID samples from a distribution, whose probability of success is , cannot possibly have any number of finite successes. Simply take the limit of the Binomial distribution for any positive integer , in the limit as the number of samples approach infinity and you'll get zero. (Sorry if this paragraph was hard to read; the first sentence is really the key point, the second is only in case you want to try and prove it yourself, but can be ignored.) You can get one positive sample out of infinite rolls if the distribution is either not independent or not identically distributed. If it's not independent, you need only set it up as a Markov chain (which, loosely speaking, is essentially sequential probability distribution where each draw depends on earlier draws in some manner) that's set so that the probability of drawing a "success" doesn't start at zero, but can be irreversibly set to zero at some point in the sequence. (For example, this can easily be achieved by something called a "Hidden Markov Model".) If the samples are independent, but not identical then the answer is even simpler. Only have one sample draw from a probability distribution for which a success is possible, and all other samples drawn from a distribution from which a success is not possible. Though I suspect that this scheme would violate a certain implicit assumption in your original question. 

Arguments for the existence of God generally fall into certain categories (e.g. cosmological arguments, moral arguments, arguments from design, etc). But into which categories arguments for the existence of the soul fall into? 

Pietism was a 17th century Lutheran theological movement emphasizing private religious study and kindness. Now, Kant was raised in a pietist household and enrolled in pietist schools. So is there any parallel between his moral philosophy and pietist teachings? 

Gorgias argued that nothing existed in a now lost work called "On Nature". There are two surviving paraphrasis of it, however. The one by Sextus Empiricus can be found here, if you're interested. 

For Kant, a tree falling in a forest will make a sound in so far as every necessary condition for it making a sound has been given. In the Critique of Pure Reason, he generally extends both causality and the principle of sufficient reason to all possible experience (A195/B240 [1] and A201/B246 [2])[*] such that, for any possible event, it's conditions to occur must have been given in the world. He also took causality for granted on a fragment [3] dating to 1788, immediatelly after the publication of the second edition of the CPR. Now, compare the problem of a falling tree with Hume's problem of whether the sun will rise tomorrow given that it has risen every single day before. For Hume, our expectation that it ought to rise is completely due to our generalization of the past experience. For Kant, if the sun happens to not rise one morning, it should very well have a darn good reason not to, because otherwise such an event would violate those two principles. On the other hand, it isn't impossible that a falling tree doesn't make a sound when no one is around for entirely empirical reasons but, just like it isn't impossible that the sun should explode overnight, we have no evidence to suggest that this is the case and thus we cannot think to ourselves that it might be without violating these principles, as whatsoever happens in the world ought to have a cause in the world. In anyway, the way this question is presented never suggests that humans ought to be considered a relevant empirical condition for it making a sound or not, but as a purely metaphysical question. The bit about whether it makes a sound or not if no one has the relevant categories to perceive this event is a different question. Because, if the event in question isn't merely not perceived, but imperceptible, it wouldn't be an object in any possible experience and thus nothing could ever be said about it with any degree of certainty. [*] With the caution of not extending their domain to the whole of experience, which would lead to the Third Antinomy of Pure Reason (A488/B516)[4].
