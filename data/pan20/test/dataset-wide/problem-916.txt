In Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks, in part 10, Thomas Buddenbrook finds himself reading a treatise on philosophy, which elevates him above his day to day care to a level where he can see the pettiness of this life and how death should be welcomed as it erases the singular person. However, this state soon escapes him and he goes back to his complacent life as a merchant. The book is never named, but appears to have been Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation. Is there some deeper significance to this episode, beyond underlining just how stifled Thomas has become through him feeling compelled to continue the family business? To what extent could readers have been expected to recognise the book as Schopenhauer's treatise when Buddenbrooks first came out? 

This led the Swedish government to declare itself a non-combatant, rather than neutral. Sweden gave material aid and allowed volunteers to join the Finnish army. Sweden also let Finnish children be evacuated to Sweden. Furthermore, it should be noted that at least during the Winter war, Finland was not an ally of Germany. There has however been a debate to what extent it was allied with Germany during the continuation war, which I will not go into here. Thus, being friendly to Finland, and even giving material aid, was nothing extraordinary during the early parts of the war. Probably the only ones that took the Soviet side in Sweden at that time was the communists. During the latter parts, when Finland fought on the same side as Germany, which occupied Denmark and Norway, sympathies were more mixed. Did Selma Lagerlöf sympathize with the Nazis? No, not really. She did on occasion do things that today would be seen as racist (there is a novella of hers that depicts the Travellers as a lower breed, and she once got involved in a beauty contest to present a "real Swedish type of Woman"), but she also helped Jewish-German author Nelly Sachs to flee to Sweden, and she wrote a novella to aid "Jews and other unwanted people" that tried to flee Germany. However, when she came under pressure in Germany following this, she cowed in and issued a statement that it was an act of mercy, not a political statement. So there is really nothing that says that Lagerlöf had any particular Nazi sympathies, beyond perhaps the orientation towards Germany that was common in her generation. Her support for Finland was something very much in line with the official Swedish attitude of the time. Sources All of my sources are in Swedish: 

If none of the above was available to you, you could also get married outside of England, most typically in Gretna Green in Scotland. The Scottish Presbyterian Church only required that you pledged yourself to your partner in the presence of a witness, up until 1856, when a requirement of a 21-day residency was imposed. This option was used when the other were closed, as for example for people up to the age of 21, who until 1823 required parental consent to get married.

Elinor owned about 1000 pounds (we are told this in chapter 2), Edward 2000. The interest from this would have been 150 pounds a year (5 percent was what you got from government bonds, so this is the golden standard when calculating interest. Austen used this herself, as will be seen). The living that Edward had been presented by Colonel Brandon generated about 200 pounds a year, though there were some possibility of renegotiation with the parishers (so that they would perhaps reach the figure of 250 in the quote). 350 pounds would perhaps have been possible to live on, but it would not have been strictly genteel. For comparison, this is less than what the Price family had in Mansfield Park. However, things do get better. The passage you quote essentially says that Robert was given a thousand pounds a year of the income of the elder Ferrars, while Edward, when Robert now also had what was seen as an objectionable choice, had risen in the graces. Thus, he had been promised to be given the same amount (10000 pounds) that had been set as Fanny's dowry. This would more than double their income. So, to summarize their economy: They own 1000 pounds that came with Elinor, 2000 that Edward owned when he was disowned, plus the 10000 from above. Their income was thus: 

Properly, the name Edda refers only to one work: Snorri's Edda, a work on Norse poetics, including the background in mythology necessary to write and understand such. The name probably comes from an Icelandic word for (great) grandmother, but there are also other theories. The so-called Poetic Edda, also known as Sæmundar Edda (from Sæmund the Learned) or the Elder Edda, is a modern construct. 17th century Icelandic Scholars knew Snorri's Edda, and speculated that he had used an older collection of poetry when writing his book. When bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson got into his possesion a manuscript containing a collection of poetry dealing with different mythological and legendary matters, he was sure he had found that Edda. The manuscript was sent to the Danish King, and is today known as the Codex Regius (Bishop Brynjólfur also secured Flateyjarbók for posterity). Today, the name The poetic Edda is seen as the preferable one (it was almost certainly not compiled by Sæmund), and is commonly used. Modern editions often add poetry discovered in other sources apart from the Codex Regius. Thus, both the name and the exact contents are modern conventions. As for the age of the poetry itself, it is really impossible to say. The poetry was likely orally transmitted during long periods, with a relatively stable core being improvised on or having small changes. This is evidenced by Völuspá, where we have two full length versions as well as fragments given by Snorri: they differ in which order they present some matters, have differing passages, and one seem to have had a Christian message attached to it. Some parts are identical, however. We can see that some passages has older grammar or word choices, but this does not help to date the work in it's entirety. One passage can also be found in a 9th century German source, but that is as far back as we can really be sure. Veda seems to stem form a PIE word for "knowledge". According to Etymology Online, it's closest cognate in North Germanic languages today is Swedish "veta" (surprisingly close), which stems from Old Norse vita, according to SAOB. Thus, there does not seem to be any substantial link here. Sources You should be able to verify the first three paragraphs in any half-way decent intoduction to a modern edition of at least the poetic Edda. I have used Lars Lönnroth's translation Den poetiska Eddan and Karl G. Johansson's and Mats Malm's Snorres Edda. Lönnroth has also supplied the argument in the fourth paragraph. 

The mother of Fenrir is called Angrboða in Hyndluljóð. The sun is said by Snorri to be chased by the wolf Sköll, who will catch up to it and devour it at Ragnarök. (Sköll is sometimes conflated with Fenrir in other poems). As to if and how this resonance is important, it is more difficult to say without access to The Fall of Arthur, but it could range from the entirely coincidental ("wolf in forest" and "east" are not so specific so as to make it totally improbable), via subconscious influence and general allusion to a specific reference. My guess is that Tolkien did have the Völuspá in mind, but that he used it mostly for the effect of the imagery, and perhaps for the suggestion of world-shattering events (in the Codex Regius, the stanza comes right before the events of Ragnarök, in Hauksbók, it comes before the Aesir-Vanir war). There could be a further suggestion of The Battle of Maldon as well, where the Viking host invading form the east are called "slaughter-wolves". 

According to the Gilbert schema for understanding Ulysses, created by Joyce for his friend Stuart Gilbert, the technique that is used in the "Cyclops chapter" (a designation that also comes from the schema) is "gigantism". This normally means the overgrowth of the entire body or certain parts of it, which seems an apt likeness for the kind of long lists the question is about. That the chapter connected to the giant cyclops should use a technique with such a name seems like one of the more self-evident parts of the schema. (According to the Linati schema, also made by Joyce, the technique is instead "alternating assymmetry", which is not quite as self-evident). 

The alliterations can be separated by other words. I will give an example out of Hávamál, where I've marked the alliterations (the structure is two short lines that alliterate with eachother, then one longer line with an internal alliteration, and then this is repeated): 

I dug up the quote on Google Books, as I believe it is relevant to the question exactly how the sentences are joined together. The full paragraph reads: 

I would argue that a genre is a kind of non-spoken contract between creator and reader, an implicit understanding of some of the things that has to be accepted to make the work function as intended. One of the most important such understanding when it comes to literature is that if something is a labelled "fiction", then it need not have anything to do with reality. Many genres of fiction ascribe further to a certain realism, where it is deemed important that most or all events contained in the work are realistic, and most try for at least a level of psychological realism, where the characters are supposed to act in a believable manner. However, different genres can play more or less loosely with the realism, sometimes replacing it with a set of genre conventions; for example, in most detective fiction, it is expected that some sort of justice is ultimately served, while some science fiction subgenres relax the laws of physics as we know them so that interstellar travel is possible. Other genres instead are defined mainly by the form that the work takes: poetry places further constraints on language, where the lines classically has had to follow some sort of pattern, but where instead word order or word choices are freer than "ordinary" language. Of course, genres are not rigid things: it is, for example, possible to write detective fiction where justice is not served. Challenging the conventions has always been a way to create new, interesting works. Even if a creator has intended to place his creation firmly within a certain genre, readers can also derive enjoyment through treating it as if it belonged to another: an excellent example of this is the sherlockians who treats Arthur Conan Doyles stories as "real" retellings of the adventures of an historical figure. Thus, genres are useful shortcuts that lets us dispense with certain questions about the realism of certain things (such as "how comes this person always stumbles into murder mysteries with unnaturally clever attempts to cover the tracks?"), and instead analyse the qualities of a work with the genre conventions taken as a a given. 

There are great variations of how trolls are portrayed, but it is not primarily a matter of national literature. I will be focusing on Sweden and Norway, where I know the traditions best. First, we should note that trolls range in appearance from some that are quite human-like, to the point that they are able to move in human society and can only be spotted if someone sees that they have a tail, to some that are huge, monstrous beasts that really does not seem to differ from giants. Trolls that looks like humans also tend to act quite human, in that they live in families, does things like keep animals, brew beer and marry, even if they live long and have magical powers. They can get along well with neighbouring humans, or behave as tricksters and thieves. They sometimes rob a mother of her child and place a changeling in it's stead, and they can also catch and hold grownups inside mountains. They typically live in forested areas. These traditions are strong in southern and middle Sweden (in northern Sweden there is a similar type of creature which are collectively known as "vittra"). I don't know how common they were in Norway. The larger trolls are more monstrous in their deeds as well, and are often the type that would treaten to eat unwary travellers in folk tales. This type seems to be more common in Norway, but there are examples from Sweden as well. They tend to live in mountainous regions. However, the difference is on a sliding scale and can be from story to story, rather than from region to region. We can take one famous example, Peer Gynt, as told by Ibsen, where the title character in the second act ends up in the hall of the mountain king, under Dovre. The king offers to let Peer marry his daughter Anitra and be made into a troll. There is no suggestion here that the trolls are in any way hideous: Peer calls Anitra lovely (Act two, scene five). The story of Peer Gynt has parallels to the Icelandic Kjalnesinga saga, from the 14th century, in which the hero actually marries the daughter of the king of Dovre and has a son with her. The most famous depictions of trolls from Norway was made by Theodor Kittelsen, contemporary with Ibsen; here is one example. A generation later, Swedish artist John Bauer similarly shaped the perception in Sweden. Here is one excellent example. Note how the Swedish trolls, while large, are clearly on a much smaller scale. These depictions mean that trolls today are mostly thought of as quite inhuman, even if they are not always outright monstrous. The troll tradition seems to have been much less strong in Denmark, likely since the trolls were associated with wild and untamed areas, which were much less common there. I don't know much about Finnish or Sami traditions, even there seems to have been similar creatures to at least the more monstrous trolls. Long story short: while there are tendencies that trolls tend to be more human-like in Sweden, and larger and less civilised in Norway, and there certainly are stories that clearly originate from particular regions, there are no hard rules. The biggest difference is probably that trolls in Norway tend to live in mountains, while trolls in Sweden are more associated with forests. Sources I found a good overview of different stories in Johan Egerkrans Nordisk väsen. I also checked Wikipedia in Bokmål, Danish and Swedish to see if there were significant differences or particular stories.
