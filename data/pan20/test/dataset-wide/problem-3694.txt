You would have to ask your instructor to clarify for specifics. Cadence is used to count the number of times one foot rotates a complete circle around the crankset. So if you are counting the right foot, to go from top to bottom to top is one. Count for a minute, and you get your cadence. Tempo is very often used as a measure of intensity, especially when combined with devices that measure power, or when compared to a race pace. Something that is done "at tempo" is near to the same pace you would use when racing a particular distance. However, your instructor may be using them interchangeably or with different meanings, best is to ask him/her for an explanation. Note: This is also the same terminology used in running, you will hear references to running cadence and tempo workouts. 

Unfortunately, there are really no available facilities to do blood tests yourself, most likely because of the nature of how they get analyzed and the specific items needed to collect the specimens, as well as being cost prohibitive and federally regulated for portions of the process. For example, most blood tubes have some sort of additive to cause the blood to react in specific ways. A tiger top tube (red and black rubber stop) or the newer plastic version, the gold top, has a clot activator and a gel for specific serum separation. Once the blood is drawn, it is centrifuged, and then assayed in various ways, most of them involving microscopic counts and smears of various types. In addition to this, there are various reagents and stains for blood tests that are necessary, most of which require some sort of facility type license (clinic, hospital, etc) to purchase. And, the last time I checked, the needles and other implements were also controlled, due to their possible use as drug paraphernalia. Add to the list training, because if you are drawing different types of tubes, there are specific methods and order of draw to avoid contamination one tube with another, disposal of the body fluids and sharps after you are done, which is tightly federally regulated, with very hefty fines for improper disposal or infractions. Additionally, it is extremely awkward to draw blood on yourself, and an improper draw can result in exploded RBC's in your sample, which means you have to start all over. There are various home kits that you can order for different tests, however they are somewhat cost prohibitive, and are of the blood spot, send it in type of test. I am not aware of any where you draw your own tubes and send them in, but I haven't looked at them in a while, that may have changed. Your best bet would be to come up with something that you want to test/prove, research the literature to see if it has been done already, and then present it to a local college that has a doctoral level kinesiology program, and see if they want to take it on as a research paper. 

Note that they give it as a 12,000kJ diet which is in the neighborhood of 2800 calories a day, which is fairly substantial in the average non athlete. For the question that you cite, I think you're misinterpreting it a bit. You can absorb more, but it may not be beneficial. The cited article in that question reviews a few different studies, and concludes that .75g/lb/day is the highest limit that benefits structural changes (i.e. muscle building). You can eat more safely, and absorb more safely, but it may not really be of any benefit. 

The main reason for using a bosu ball is to increase the number of muscles and muscle fibers recruited for the activity, and to increase the proprioception. I had to use the Bosu quite extensively for my Achilles rupture rehab, and here's a few the exercises that I was doing (My PT guys were creative sadists, but they were good.): 

Unless you are depressed to the point where you just don't work out at all, or don't try, I am not aware of any negative that depression has on the effects of working out, at least by itself. Most of the studies around show that exercise has a beneficial effect on depression and can help alleviate/prevent depressive bouts. Where you might be getting an impact is in the anxiety disorder, which can result in increased levels of cortisol due to stress. Cortisol is catabolic in nature (Meaning it breaks down muscle rather than building it), so high levels of this from stress could be undermining your efforts. I believe cortisol is also associated with lowered levels of natural anabolic hormones in the body, but that is from memory only, I haven't looked it up yet. 

Endurance is like anything else, it takes time to build up. Many people find that a program such as a couch to 5k or similar can help get them back training to a more effective level, and I have found that the Galloway run/walk method can also be an effective way to increase endurance safely. It sounds also like you may have had some muscle catabolism or other damage due to the illness, and that will also take some time to repair and recover. It may be that you simply can't run much yet because you are replacing the lost muscle tissue first. I highly recommend some sessions, or at least a consultation with a physical therapist, as they may be able to provide better guidance on how to go about getting back to where you were. 

Normally when people ask how to increase their speed in running, the answer is simply "run more". However, you have that part pretty good, injuries notwithstanding. There are two concepts that you need to add into your program on a regular basis as far as speedwork, and that is threshold and interval training. Interval training raises your top end speed, threshold training increases the amount of time you can spend at that speed. Interval training is high intensity, high speed, long rest type training. Since you have a 5:44 mile personal best (PB), that is a 2:51 pace. A good interval workout for you would be 1-2 mile warmup, 8x800 @ 2:30, 2-5 minutes rest between, 1-2 mile warmdown. You can play with the rest and the pace, the goal is to be able to make every single interval. If you can't make the interval, either your pace is a little too fast, or you don't have enough rest. (no more than 4-5 minutes rest max, though). Threshold training is at or near race pace, short rest intervals. If your race pace is 6:51 (That's a 1:30 1/2 pace), then you should be doing segments of running at 7:00, on short rest. You can also do the basic fartlek, strides, pickup type runs as well. Now to address your seeming walls in the full marathon. Most of the time if you can do the work and the race gets wonky, it's usually one of two things: Going out too fast, or nutrition. You've got to be on your hydration and nutrition from the get go, if you wait you're done. For your pacing, it's much better to run the 2nd half slightly faster than the first, than go out hard and try to hang on. You also have to pay attention to conditions. One final tip: Most of the time, runners go too hard on their easy days, and too easy on their hard days. If a run plan says easy, run it easy. If it says hard, kill it. If you need a rest day, take a rest day. You've got the times that suggest you can run the distance and time, it seems like its the execution that needs work. Go back and review all of your races, and see if there is a common limiting factor. Good luck! 

If you want to slim down the body, diet is not irrelevant. However, the two comments that you make are at odds with each other. The primary functions of muscle are to move the body to perform tasks, such as walking, seeing, eating, digestion, sitting, etc etc etc. Your muscles will adapt to whatever exercises you do, in order to be more efficient at doing the exercise. Part of this adaptation includes growth both in size and density. This will only occur to the extent to which you do the exercises. The reason an overweight, blobby video game addict looks the way they do is they don't exercise at all, and only move when necessary. Part of the reason a competitive bodybuilder looks the way they do is they specifically train to look that way. Your image is somewhere in the middle. Part of the problem is nobody can see what you mean by slimmer, what you consider "bulging abs", etc. It might help if you could post a picture of what you want to look like. 

Myosatellite cells are basically inactive structures that are found in mature muscle cells. Depending on the stimulus, they can develop into different things in the muscle. As I understand it, they have a couple of functions. They can increase the number of nuclei, create new muscle fiber or spawn off daughter cells. The increase in muscle fiber content is fairly obvious as far as benefits, but the increase in nuclei helps with protein production in long, fused muscle fibers. Both an increase in muscle fiber and an increase in the nuclei will lend themselves to increased performance. It's been suggested that the initial response to stimulus is to increase the number of nuclei, and if the pattern of stress continues, to then start creating new muscle fibers. While muscle fiber may shrink and disappear with detraining, there are some studies that suggest that the number of nuclei do not diminish with detraining, even past the 90 day mark. This may help explain why someone that has performed at a certain level in the past has an easier time returning to that level. (Which has been termed muscle memory).
