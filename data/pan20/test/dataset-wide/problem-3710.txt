This problem is NP-complete, thus there is no easily verifiable condition that would be necessary and sufficient. In fact, it is enough if only some of the triples are prescribed, see Cyclic ordering is NP-complete by Galil and Megiddo. Another, closely related problem is Betweenness. 

Since that Mirko Visontai told me that the answer is ${a+b\choose a}/(a+b)$ if $\gcd(a,b)=1$. The proof is the following (with k=a and l=b): The number of 0--1 vectors with $k$ 0's and $l$ 1's is ${k+l\choose k}$, so we have to prove that out of these vectors exactly $1/(k+l)$ fraction is an element of $L(k,l)$. The set of all vectors can be partitioned into equivalence classes. Two vectors $p$ and $q$ are equivalent if there is a cyclic shift that maps one into the other, i.e., if for some $j$, $p_i = q_{i+j}$ for all $i$. We will prove that exactly one element from each equivalence class will be in $L(k,l)$. This proves the statement as each class consists of $k+l$ elements because $gcd(k,k+l)=1$. We can view each 0--1 sequence as a walk on $\mathbb R$ where each 0 is a $-l/(k+l)$ step and each 1 is a $+k/(k+l)$ step. Each $(k,l)$ walk starts and ends at zero and each walk reaches its maximum height exactly once, otherwise $ak + bl = 0$ for some $0 < a +b < k+l$ which would imply $\gcd(k,l) \neq 1$. If we take the cyclic shift that ``starts from the top'', we stay in the negative region throughout the walk, which corresponds to remaining under the diagonal in the lattice path case. Any other cyclic shift goes above zero, which corresponds to going above the diagonal at some point. 

I think some positive proportion, like 50% of all positions with legal pieces may arise in a legal game. I also think that the upper bound of $10^{47}$ in wikipedia might be wrong. Consider only the 28-piece, no pawn configurations. If all pieces were different, this would give $(64!)/(36!)\approx 3.4\cdot 10^{47}$ positions. Also, there are ${19 \choose 7}\approx 5\cdot 10^4$ ways to promote the 12 pawns into 8 possible non-king pieces (not counting those with too many white/black pieces). Of course now we have to divide with the figures that are the same, but that should be around (and here is the only place where I make an estimate) $4^8=6.5 \cdot 10^4$ usually, as there are 8 non-king pieces, on average 3 of each, and I rounded up because factorials are like that... So multiplying and dividing these numbers we get about $10^{47}$ positions. Of course because of the kings in chess (few because of too many bishops on same color or when the one is in check, the other could not make the last move etc) not all of these are possible, but we were quite generous when not counting positions with pawns, so I believe that there are at least this many legal positions that can arise during a game and the same order of magnitude when counting positions that can be set up with legal pieces, as almost all with 28 pieces are from a legal game. 

Everybody learns the usual definition of the dual of a planar graph when edges are preserved and faces are mapped to vertices. Everybody learns the projective duality. What if we apply it to a geometric graph, do we get a useful notion? The vertices would be mapped to lines and edges to "hourglasses" (aka double wedges) in a certain way. Planarity ensures that every line is contained in at most one hourglass (except the lines corresponding to the vertices). Has this been ever studied/used to solve a problem? 

Yes it is true, it follows easily from Tutte's disjoint tree theorem for k=2: $URL$ In every partition class with n_i vertices you can have at most 2n_i-3 edges, plus the edges between the partitions, but this together still gives only 2n-2-|P| edges, where |P| is the number of partitions. (This is joint answer with Filip Moric who does not have a MO account.) 

Isn't this easy by induction? Delete one of the largest numbers, say $m$, from your sequence, realize the remaining numbers, then in the realization pick any region with winding number $m-1$, and make an extra loop somewhere close to its boundary. 

You could not find a reference because the statement is not true. Suppose that we are in two dimensions but both are measures are concentrated on a line. The first measure is uniform on $1,\ldots,k$ while the second measure is uniform on $-1,\ldots,-k$. In this case any open halfplane has measure $0$ or $1$ with respect to one of the metrics. If you add the condition that the points in the support are in a general position, then the statement follows trivially from the continuous version. 

These runs are strongly related to Young tableaux. So it is the best to first make a tableau that has the corresponding property. This we can construct by induction: Start with 1, then make a copy of it +1 and put it below, then copy it +2 and put it right from it. So you should get: $\begin{array}{cc} 1&3\cr 2&4\cr \end{array}$. After repeating it on, we get $\begin{array}{cccc} 1&3&9&11\cr 2&4&10&12\cr 5&7&13&15\cr 6&8&14&16\cr \end{array}$ and so on. To make a sequence of this, first take the last row of the tableau, then the last but one and so on, so you should get $6, 8, 14, 16, 5, 7, 13, 15, 2, 4, 10, 12, 1, 3, 9, 11$. Now, without giving a formal proof, any long enough run must skip over two correspondingly big "breaks" in the matrix which will make it have a large width. Unless I am mistaken, a run of length $c\sqrt n$ should have width $\Omega(c n)$. Update: I was mistaken, as pointed out by Aaron, so the width should be smaller. 

In fact, since Reingold proved that STCONN is in L these languages are also in L. The proof for the first is the following. For every u neighbor of v, delete the uv edge and check whether u and v are connected in the resulting graph. If yes, then there is a cycle. If the answer is no for all u, then there is no cycle containing v. The proof of the second is similar, first check for a cycle containg v, then consider all the edges of v deleted and check whether there is a cycle in the remaining graph, e.g. as before for every pair of vertices. 

I've just come across this proof of the Graham-Pollak Theorem by Sundar Vishwanathan (thanks to Konrad Swanepoel's sporadic comments about it on this site), that must be called beautiful after its author. The paper mentions (after lemma 3) that certain other linear algebra proofs can also be replaced by similar pigeonhole principle applications. But I couldn't find any, so I thought that we should collect some similar beautiful proofs here. I don't mind if it also uses parity or other tricks, but linear algebra should be replaced! For example, can anyone prove the Oddtown theorem? 

In fact, you cannot do better than $k-2\sqrt{k\log k}$, i.e., for any $k$ permutations, there is a 0-1 sequence on which the cost of any permutation is at least this much. The prove is a simple application of known results about the Set Cover problem. Consider the last $t=\sqrt{k\log k}$ positions in each permutation, these give $k$ sets of size $t$. We want to hit each of them with an element from our base set, this is called the Hitting Set problem and its dual is the Set Cover problem. You can read more details about them on Wikipedia, the important thing is that there is a fractional hitting set of size $k/t$ and since the integrality gap of the problem is at most $\log k$, there is a hitting set of size $(k\log k)/t$. This means that we can select $(k\log k)/t$ positions such that any permutation contains at least one of them. If we set these positions to be 0's and the others to be 1's, then in any permutation there is a 0 somewhere towards the back and there are many 1's everywhere, a simple calculation gives a cost of at least $k-t-(k\log k)/t=k-2\sqrt{k\log k}$. 

This only solves the problem for $\mathbb Z$ but the proof was too long for a comment. The hull of $\mathbb Z$ has only one graph, $\mathbb Z$, so only the decorations are different for the elements of the hull of a decorated $\mathbb Z$, $G$. The automorphisms of $\mathbb Z$ are just shifts with a possible reflection. Suppose that there is a periodic graph $H$ in the hull for some decoration. If there is a non-zero shift in the automorphsim of $H$, after a while the balls forming $H$ will be larger than the size of the shift, so the periodicity appears in them. Therefore, for some sequence $s$ it is true that for every $t$ there is an interval whose decoration is $t$ times $s$ concatenated, $s^t$. But by recursion it is easy to show that there is a decoration such that every sequence is repeated only a bounded number of times, and no interval longer than four is symmetric. In fact, now after writing this up, it seems to me that a similar argument should work for any bounded degree graph. Just for every sequence we have to make sure that it won't appear many times under the automorphism of large enough balls. Update 03.09. Here I describe a construction in more detail for $\mathbb Z$ (the same method works for every graph). We use only two numbers, $0$ and $1$. For every sequence $s$ we make sure that it does not occur more than $t(s)$ times where $t(s)$ are some large numbers. From the above discussion, this is sufficient if no interval longer than four is symmetric. (Imo, this is the main part of the proof and the rest is standard methods.) Using KÃ¶nig's lemma, it is enough to give a construction for every finite interval $[1,n]$. Image the possible $2^n$ decorations of this interval as a complete binary tree of depth $n$. When we forbid $00$, the repetition of $0$ twice, then that is equivalent to suitably trimming this tree. After the trimming, we can contract the new degree $2$ vertices into an edge, this way we obtain a new (not complete) binary tree. We can cut down its lower vertices to obtain a new, still quite deep binary tree. Then we repeat the trimming with the next sequence, with a suitable $t(s)$ that does not transform the whole tree after trimming into a path, and so on. Oh, and to make sure that no long intervals are symmetric, first we start trimming the parts that correspond to a repetition.
