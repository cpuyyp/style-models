Thank you for those who reply. Maybe let me condense my query a bit. It is that 'I think, therefore I am' seems a bit tautological, that when he says 'I', it is simultaneously implied the cognitive activity of thinking which is necessary for I to recognize myself and to utter 'I'. Also, surely, both 'I' is identical and we are ascribing different activities or states which has the same subject 'I' relied on, and this sounds a bit tautological to me. So when I read the critic by Bertrand Russell, I promptly agree. 'If the cogito does not presuppose a substantial self, what then is the epistemic basis for injecting the “I” into the “I think”? Some critics have complained that, in referring to the “I”, Descartes begs the question by presupposing what he means to establish in the “I exist.” Among the critics, Bertrand Russell objects that “the word ‘I’ is really illegitimate.” Echoing the 18th century thinker, Georg Lichtenberg, Russell writes that Descartes should have, instead, stated “his ultimate premiss in the form ‘there are thoughts’.” Russell adds that “the word ‘I’ is grammatically convenient, but does not describe a datum.” (1945, 567) Accordingly, “there is pain” and “I am in pain” have different contents, and Descartes is entitled only to the former' 

Aside from the psychological question of whether to act or remain static with respect to harm and blame, such as in the Trolley Problem (or Train Track Dilemma), it seems that many folks like to think in black and white. Recent discussions pertaining to terrorists comprise one set of examples relating to whether to kill or let be, ban or accept. Another important consideration, which is probably more related to ego, beliefs of soul and causality, and ideas of punishment, is that it feels better (emotionally) to put others into categories of good and bad, good and evil, without considering the finer details and factors of causality involved. A person is often seen as either "civil" or "criminal", as if these words really describe a person's value or virtue whatsoever. Hence, if people see Hitler as being "evil", they may feel that any showing of sympathy is intolerable and unbearable. After all, why would you help a "bad" person? Society would need to accept the idea that causality is complex and that most ill events cannot rightly be blamed wholly on one entity. Furthermore, it is absurd to think that Hitler alone "did" what they say "he did". Leaders are often spoken of as if they personally enacted all the events that unfolded under them. Also, what is to say that there were no pressures on Hitler from others? Could there, for example, have been friends, family, or lovers peer-pressuring him to act in certain ways? Maybe some person or entity was even manipulating him in one way or another. I doubt he was magically impervious to influence from others. Moreover, Hitler is by no means whatsoever more evil in nature than a relatively large portion of society both then and now. A great many people exist today, who if they were in a position of great power, would do great harm to a great many other people and or things. Taking it even further, imagine putting a 4-year-old child into a position of great power. That would be quite scary indeed. Are 4-year-old children then evil monsters? Well, perhaps, but the point is that society involves interaction, and almost all large-scale events could not have happened without a great many hands at play -- both physically and in terms of social and or financial influence. 

If something has a natural desire for something, then that desire cannot be in vain, i.e. it must in principle be possible to fulfill that desire. All things have a natural desire to exist. Humans have knowledge of eternal truths about existence. Thus humans have a natural desire to exist forever. Therefore, humans exist forever. 

If your definition of revolution is conflict between classes, then a hypothetical ideal communist society would be classless, so the notion of revolution would be meaningless. Of course, actual regimes which call themselves communist are generally saying that they subscribe to Marx's ideology and that their (ostensible) goal is to achieve Marx's ideal communist society, not that their society at the present has attained that status yet. For one thing, Marx envisioned a stateless utopia, whereas those countries have governments and thus have a political class, so insofar as there is still class distinction in those countries, you could still have a revolution in your sense. 

If you would rather not get directly involved in the wrongdoing that you are witnessing, then film it or otherwise make known (accurately and honestly) who did what. This way, society can rely on the usual reputation of individuals to punish the wrongdoer and deter others from wronging similarly. Simply speak out publicly, such as Online, about these types of events in general. This option avoids becoming directly associated with the specific instances witnessed while still potentially having an effect on society in general. 

Doing nothing may not be ideal, but in itself it is practically neutral. Implying that a person is acting immorally by doing nothing is implying that the person has an obligation (or duty) to act upon these types of situations. A security guard or police officer is a person specifically paid by society to act in this capacity. For such a guard or officer to do nothing would indeed be grounds for immorality (and failing to do one's duties). As for solutions to this problem, I have two possible suggestions: 

These two strands were merged into the ideology we call American liberalism by John Dewey and his followers, who argued that we needed a broader conception of liberty than the one maintained by laissez-faire negative-rights libertarians. The key idea can be summed up in a quote from Anatole France: "In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread." Basically, the idea is that the freedom to starve because you have no food is not a meaningful freedom at all, because it does not maximize your autonomy or allow your to realize your potential, which were important goals in classical liberalism. Thus Dewey argued that we should recognize positive liberty as well as negative liberty, meaning that e.g. just as we ought to recognize a right to live without someone killing you, we similarly ought to recognize a right to live without dying due to lack of food. Thus American liberalism advocates that the government should play some role in the economy in order to give people autonomy and enable them to pursue their own happiness, along the lines of the "responsiveness" part of the Progressive philosophy. Thus Americans liberals still try to achieve the goals of classical liberalism, but they sometimes do it through Progressive means. (This is akin to how, as I discuss in my other answer, American conservatism tries to achieve the goals of traditionalism, but often through libertarian means.) There's one other way that American liberalism differs from classical liberalism: classical liberals took a deontological perspective on liberty, viewing personal autonomy and the pursuit of happiness as things that are inherently worthy of being promoted, regardless of what they lead to. American liberalism, on the other hand, because it emerged partly from Progressivism, tends to take a more utilitarian perspective on such things, viewing autonomy merely as a means to an end, the end being increasing the happiness of as many people as possible. The liberal understanding of utilitarianism is perhaps best understood through the work of John Rawls, who proposed a thought experiment along roughly these lines: suppose that you're a soul waiting to be born, but you don't know which body you're going to be born into and what experiences that body is going to have. But before you're born, you have the opportunity to design how society and government should be. How should you design it in order to maximize your chances of having a good life? Well, you don't know what desires you're going to have, but whatever they are, you're probably going to want them fulfilled, so you would want a society that as much as possible allows people to pursue their own happiness. And you may end up being born in utter poverty that may prevent you from being happy, or you may start off being wealthy but then you may suffer calamities like disease and natural disasters, so assuming you're risk averse (as humans tend to be in most circumstances), you'd want the government to have a safety net to shelter you from such risks. So that's where the basic contours of the liberal position emerge. Finally, let me mention something about foreign policy. The Progressive presidents advocated a very interventionist foreign policy, since they were motivated by the desire to help people as much as possible, even people abroad. Liberals still share some of this impulse, and are willing to support limited American military intervention in circumstances of extreme humanitarian crisis. But mostly their foreign policy views were taken from classical liberalism, so they they're antiwar for the most part. EDIT: Yuval Levin has just written a book which argues that the positive rights vision of liberalism originated not with Dewey in the early twentieth century as I suggested, but rather in the late 1700's with Thomas Paine, one of America's founding fathers. Levin argues that the modern American left-right divide originated in the debate in America and England over the French Revolution. Paine was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, because he thought that government is an institution deliberately created by people to sageguard their individual liberty, and so it could be overthrown whenever the people thought it wasn't doing a good job. On the other hand, Edmund Burke, a predecessor to modern conservatism, saw government as an institution that grew organically as a tradition, and that we should be suspicious of making changes to it just because individuals in the current generation happen to object to it. In any case, Paine's philosophy of individualism led him to believe that an individual can only realize his full potential if he's not constrained by material want, so he believed in the government providing basic necessities to everyone. Thus, Levin argues, the early twentieth century Progressive movement was merely reinventing the wheel. 

I think the writer is quoting the original text from the chapter "Essentials for Nurturing Life"" (in Chinese 養生主). At the beginning of this chapter, Zhuangzi says (since I don't have an English translation, I just put my literal translation and some understanding here) our life is limited, and knowledge isn't. If we get ourselves addicted into knowledge (actually Zhuangzi, or the Taoist doctrine, resists all types of addiction and we shall not be bound by anything. So in my opinion, in Zhuangzi's sense, we may still be fully liberated if our mind is not attached to anything, and if one daoist believer cannot attain liberation due to the imprisonment, he can just suicide), then our spirit (I don't use mind since mind requires us to be rational, and it seems to me spirit in Zhuangzi's term requires us to be consciously liberal rather than rational) cannot be liberated and it would be dangerous to our life (in the spiritual sense. Chinese people may say your life is pointless or fruitless if you live a restrained life that you can't liberate your spirit). So in this sense, one living such a life is not wise as well. This might be why the writer of wiki Zhuangzi uses "foolish". 

The basic premise here is that there are more ways to have a positive effect on the world than directly getting involved in specific instances of wrongdoing. Sometimes just bringing an issue to light, especially if you have clear evidence of the wrongdoing and a clear argument as to why it is wrong, can make a big difference in the long run of society. The history of humanity will always have wrongdoing in it. In fact, these events may even be necessary since we learn from our mistakes -- and without mistakes, we can hardly learn. Pointing out mistakes can go a long way, even when done after the fact. On the topic of Trump and Hillary, if you honestly would rather not vote for either, then another option is to speak out your reasoning. Explaining why you do not accept either candidate lets others in a similar situation know they are not alone. For maximum effect, be honest, clear, and well-composed. Remember: The long term is bigger than the short term; you may not be able to change a particular election cycle, but you can still have an effect on society. 

And in Plato's dialogue "Sophist", the Eleatic stranger, i.e. a foreigner from Elea who is a follower of Parmenides, makes mention of a Parmenidean argument that it's impossible to utter a falsehood: 

Traditionalism, the philosophy of Edmund Burke which states that there is great wisdom embedded in our social institutions and culture, so we should be careful before we try to tamper with them Libertarianism, the philosophy of John Locke which says that people have fundamental negative rights that the government should not infringe 

The dominant ideology of the Republican Party is known as American conservatism, and it was developed by William F. Buckley and his magazine National Review starting in the 1950's. The founding mission statement of National Review (see "The Magazine's Credenda" at the end) is a good elucidation of this philosophy. It is formed from two strands: 

Knowledge is traditionally defined as justified true belief: in order for S to know P, S must believe P, P must be true, and S must be justified in believing P. Now this definition has been criticized by invoking various "Gettier cases", supposed examples of justified true belief which are not knowledge. The defenders of a "justified true belief" understanding of knowledge have responded by showing that these Gettier cases are not really cases of justified true belief, by clarifying exactly what constitutes a justification. Here is the philosopher Robert Nozick's theory of justification, according to this Wikipedia article:
