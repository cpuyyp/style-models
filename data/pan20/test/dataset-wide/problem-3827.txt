In fact, you can prove that $p^+=p$ for all $p$. Actually, consider the shortest paths from $(-n,-n)$ to $(n,n)$ and from $(-n,n)$ to $(n,-n)$ passing through $p$. Taking `pluses' of them, you should also obtain the paths of the same lengths connecting the same points. Now from the first path you obtain that the sum of coordinates of $p^+$ is the same as for $p$, and from the second path you see that the difference of coordinates is the same for $p$ and $p^+$. Hence $p=p^+$. 

The question can be reformulated as: Does $\pi^{-1}(0)$ lie in $S$? Indeed, if so, then for all $s\in S$, $t\in \mathbb R[x,y]$ with $\pi(s)=\pi(t)$ we have $t-s\in S$, so $t=s+(t-s)\in S$ as well. And this seems to be true. Actually, every $t\in \pi^{-1}(0)$ is a linear combination of the polynomials $m_{ij}=x^iy^j(x+y-1)$; but both $m_{ij}$ and $-m_{ij}$ lie in $S$, thus $t\in S$ as well. 

Surely, the Smith normal form does it all. But if you need a more concrete condition, here is one. Let $X$ be the set of all $n\times n$ minors of $A$, and let $Y$ be the set of all $n\times n$ minors of $(A\,| B)$. Then the equivalent condition is that $\gcd(X)=\gcd(Y)$. Indeed, this condition is equivalent if the system is in the Smith form, and moreover it is preserved by $SL(n,\mathbb Z)$-transforms. 

Case 2. Assume that $u_{n-1}>0$. Then $$ n|S|=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}n|S_i|\leq \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}u_i\log u_i+nu_{n-1}. $$ So we are left to prove that $$ nu_{n-1}+\sum_i u_i\log u_i\leq u\log u. \qquad\qquad (*) $$ This happens to be a bit messy. Let us fix $u=\sum u_i$ and change the values of $u_i$'s. Since the function $x\log x$ is convex on $[1,+\infty)$, we may simultaneously change $u_i\to u_n$ for $i>0$, $u_0\to u-(n-1)u_{n-1}$, increasing the left-hand part of $(*)$. Hence, denoting $x=u_{n-1}$, $y=u_0$, we need to prove that $$ nx+(n-1)x\log x+y\log y\leq ((n-1)x+y)\log((n-1)x+y), $$ or $$ nx\leq (n-1)x\log\left(n-1+\frac yx\right)+y\log\left(1+\frac{(n-1)x}y\right), $$ or, denoting $1+c=y/x$ and dividing by $x$, $$ n\leq (n-1)\log(n+c)+(1+c)\log(n+c)-(1+c)\log(1+c). $$ In other words, we need $$ n\log n-1\log 1\leq (n+c)\log(n+c)-(1+c)\log(1+c), $$ which follows again from the convexity of $x\log x$. Perhaps, the last part can be simplified... 

Let $F=\mathbb R^n\setminus E$. The inequality $d(x,E)\geq a$ means that the open ball $B_a(x)$ does not intersect $E$, i.e., that $B_a(x)\subseteq F$. Now, if $a=d(x,E)$ and $b=d(y,E)$, then $B_a(x),B_b(y)\subseteq F$, thus by the convexity $B_{ta+(1-t)b}(tx+(1-t)y)=tB_a(x)+(1-t)B_b(y)\subseteq F$, which means exactly what you want. 

Assume that $n-1$ is an odd prime. Arrange the vertices as follows: $n-1$ of them lie on the circle and form a regular $(n-1)$-gon, and the $n$th vertex is the center. Now, each of the matchings consists of one radius and all the chords perpendicular to this radius. Indeed, take any two matchings and remove the two radii. The remaining egdes form a graph with two vertices of degree 1 and all the rest of degree 2. Moreover, since $n-1$ is prime, it is easy to see that this graph contains no cycles (such cycle should pass through all the vertices which is impossible). Thus this graph is a path, and the radii complete a Hamiltonian cycle. Right now I do not know what happens if $n-1$ is composite. 

Case 1. Assume that $u_{n-1}=0$, and let $k\leq n-2$ be the maximal index such that $u_k\geq 1$. Then $$ n|S|=\sum_{i=0}^{k}n|S_i|\leq \sum_{i=0}^{k}u_i\log u_i \leq u\log u, $$ with the equality achieved only if $k=1$. 

Let $V=\{a,b,c,d\}$, $E_1=\{(a,b),(a,c),(a,d)\}$, $E_2=\{a,b),(a,c),(b,c)\}$, $G_1=(V,E_1)$, and $G_2=(V,E_2)$. Then $E^-(G_1)=E^-(G_2)$ and $E^+(G_1)=E^+(G_2)$ although $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not isomorphic. 

First of all, every full rank sublattice $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb Z^n$ contains $\Lambda'=c\mathbb Z^n$ for some positive integer $c$. This $\Lambda'$ may serve as $C\mathbb Z^n$; so the question can in fact be reformulated as follows: Does every full rank sublattice $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb Z^n$ have a symmetric base, i.e. a matrix $B=B^T$ with $\Lambda=B\mathbb Z^n$? The answer seems to be yes, and, as Igor Rivin has suggested, the Smith normal form indeed helps. Let $\Lambda=A\mathbb Z^n$, and let $A=PDQ$ be the Smith decomposition of $A$, so $D$ is diagonal, and $P,Q\in SL(\mathbb Z,n)$. Then also $Q^{-1}P^T\in SL(\mathbb Z,n)$, and $B=AQ^{-1}P^T=PDP^T$ is a symmetric matrix satisfying $B\mathbb Z^n=AQ^{-1}P^T\mathbb Z^n=A\mathbb Z^n=\Lambda$. (We did ot use the full rank condition; however, if $A$ is degenerate, then $B$ is degenerate as well, so surely it does not provide a base.) 

The answer for Q1 is negative. Namely, even a strongly connected tournament may have large oriented diameter. Take the path $v_1\to v_2\to\dots\to v_n$ and connect $v_j\to v_i$ for all $i\leq j-2$. 

If you fix only the number of dice, but let the number of faces be arbitrary (or if you simply find a way to make arbitrary probabitities for different faces), then the answer for $n$ faces is $\displaystyle 1-\frac1{4\cos^2(\pi/(n+2))}$. This is proved (that's quite immodest, I know...) in my paper "intransitive roulettes" in Matematicheskoe prosveschenie, III series, 2010, Vol, 14, pp.~240--255, but only in Russian, sorry. Similar results (lacking, perhaps, only the explicit constants) can be found in the following papers: S. Trybula, On the paradox of $n$ random variables, Zastos. Mat. (Appl. Math.) 8 (1965), 143--154. Z. Usiskin, Max--min probabilities in the voting paradox, Ann. Math. Statist. 35 (1964), 857--862. The optimal example is the following. Let $q=\frac1{4\cos^2(\pi/(n+2))}$. Define $r_n=0$, $r_{i}=q/(1-r_{i+1})$. Then one can show that $1-q=r_1>r_2>\dots>r_n=0$. Now let us make the following "dice": $i$th die ($1\leq i\leq n$) makes $i$ with probability $1-r_i$ and makes $i+n$ with probability $r_i$. Then each die wins the (cyclically) previous one with probability $1-q$. Consequently, $2/3$ is the optimal number for $n=4$ for any number of faces. Pitifully, the answers for $n>4$ are irrational, hence they are not achievable on regular dice. It seems that the optimal configuration for $n>4$ on regular dice can be made by the corresponding modification of the general optimal example. E.g., for $n=5$ we have $r_4=q=0.30797\dots$, $r_3=0.445\dots$, $r_2=1-r_3$, $r_1=1-r_4$, so we cannot achieve 70%. On the other hand, these values can be approximated to make the following 5 icosahedral dice: $$(6\times 1, 14\times 6), \quad (9\times 2, 11\times 7), \quad (11\times 3, 9\times 8), \quad (14\times 4, 6\times 9), \quad (20\times 5), $$ where each wins the (cyclically) next one with probability at most $\frac{9\times 14}{20^2}=0.315$. Next, there is a bound for the answer when the number of faces is bounded (or fixed, as in our case). If the number of faces is $2k$ for each die, then consider the $k$th maximal numbers on each die. Consider the die which contains the maximal number among them; then it wins the next one with the probability at least $\frac{k+1}{4k}$. Hence for the icosahedral dice the result cannot exceed $\frac{29}{40}=0.725$. THis can be achieved on the following set: $$ (5\times 1,15\times 11), \quad (7\times 2,13\times 12), \quad (8\times 3,12\times 13), \quad (9\times 4,11\times 14), \quad (10\times 5,10\times 15), $$ $$ (11\times 6,9\times 16), \quad (12\times 7,8\times 17), \quad (13\times 8,7\times 18), \quad (15\times 9,5\times 19), \quad (20\times 10), $$ but not on a smaller one. Some less optimal answers with smaller number of dice are $$ (5\times 1,15\times 9), \quad (7\times 2,13\times 10), \quad (9\times 3,11\times 11), \quad (10\times 4,10\times 12), $$ $$ (11\times 5,9\times 13), \quad (13\times 6,7\times 14), \quad (15\times 7,5\times 15), \quad (20\times 8) $$ with losing probability at most $\frac{13\times 9}{20^2}=0.2925$, and $$ (5\times 1,15\times 7), \quad (8\times 2,12\times 8), \quad (10\times 3,10\times 9), (12\times 4,8\times 10), \quad (15\times 5,5\times 11), \quad (20\times 6) $$ with losing probability at most $\frac{15\times 8}{20^2}=\frac{12\times 10}{20^2}=0.3$ --- exactly 30% on 6 dice. Finally, for dodecahedral dice the bound is $\frac{17}{24}=0.7083\dots$, hence it is also possible to make it more than 70% (but this is impossible for octahedral dice...). The example is as follows: $$ (3\times 1,9\times 9), \quad (4\times 2,8\times 10), \quad (5\times 3,8\times 11), \quad (6\times 4,8\times 12), $$ $$ (7\times 5,8\times 13), \quad (8\times 6,8\times 14), \quad (9\times 7,8\times 15), \quad (12\times 8). $$ I cannot claim that the numbers of dice presented above are optimal for these probabilities, but it seems so. 

Let $A$ be a matrix with column sums at most $3$ with large elements in the inverse matrix. Construct a matrix of the form $\begin{pmatrix}A&0\\B&C\end{pmatrix}$, where $B$ is a $4\times n$ matrix and $C$ is a $4\times 4$ matrix. You may do this so that the resulting matrix has constat column sums (equal to $3$) and is non-degenerate. The inverse of this matrix contains $A^{-1}$ in the upper-left corner. 

Set $z=y+x^2$. Then $$ (xy+x^3,y^2,xy^2+x^5)=(xz,(z-x^2)^2,xz(y-x^2)+2x^5) =(xz,x^5,z^2+x^4) $$ and similarly $(xy+x^3,y^2+ux^4,xy^2+x^5)=(xz,x^5,z^2+(1+u)x^4)$. So, after setting $x'=x\root4\of{1+u}$ we get the required isomorphism. 

The answer is NO without any of the two additional assumptions. Consider a set of $(t-1)^2$ elements $A=\{a_{ij}\}_{i,j=1}^{t-1}\subset[n]$. Let each $T_k$ contain a "row" $R_i=\{a_{ij}\}_{j=1}^{t-1}$ and one additional element outside $A$, each row being assigned to almost the same number of $T_k$'s. Include also the sets $R_i$ into the family $\cal T$. Now let $$ {\cal S}=\bigl\{\{a_{1,i_1},\dots,a_{t,i_t}\} \;:\; i_1,\dots,i_t\in[t]\bigr\}. $$ Then these families are cross-intersecting. Next, $|{\cal T}|\leq n$, $|{\cal S}|=t^t$, and the maximal popularity is about $1/(t-1)$. Moreover, the second condition is satisfied: if $U$ does not contain any of $R_i$'s then $[n]\setminus U$ contains some element of $\cal S$. In this example, $|{\cal S}|=t^t=n^{\log\log n}$ which is a bit larger than a polynomial. But in fact, if we omit the second assumption, then it suffices to take only $t$ sets into $\cal S$, namely the columns $C_j=\{a_{ij}\}_{i=1}^{t-1}$ (and remove $R_i$'s from $\cal T$ --- they are no more needed). Here the first additional assumption holds, but not the second one. THis also shows that there is no hope for $O(1)$; namely, in the example above you may decrease $t$ a bit so that $t^t\leq poly(n)$. PS. You may find useful to look at this paper by Zs. Tuza, especially its second section. For instance, one may derive from it the following. If the sets $T_i$'s are independent with respect to the inclusion, then $|\cup {\cal T}|\leq \binom{2t}t$.
