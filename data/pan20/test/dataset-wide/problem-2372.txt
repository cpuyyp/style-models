Such unwavering faith, that drives one until one sees for himself, is often mentioned in Pali Canon in context of the factors of the path, along with persistence etc. (MN 70): 

Someone compares his situation X with someone else's situation Y. He or she reaches conclusion that situation Y is "better". S\he then craves to be in situation Y. S\he then despises situation X. S\he then feels miserable about being in situation X (i.e. experiences dukkha). S\he then identifies the other person being in situation Y as the cause of one's suffering on step 5 above. On the basis of which, there arises the desire to destroy the source of suffering. Which manifests as anger towards the object of envy. 

Somewhat loaded question... According to Buddha, what is more reliable -- textual reference or one's own direct insight that came from experience? If one's own insight is in conflict with a text, should one trust the text or one's own insight? Is there anything Buddha said about this? 

You can want to be strong instead of weak. You can want to be a master instead of victim of circumstances. You can want to learn to control your mind. You can want to help others feel less suffering, in both ways (external and internal help). You can want to know the truth from the myths. This world is a dream and everything here is like a phantom, but you can use it as gym to practice. Even if impermanent, this is good exercise. 

Speaking from experience, yes meditation improves the quality of everyday awareness. I'm generally super aware already, but after meditation my lucidity and peripheral awareness further increases. For example as I enter a room, I see more details at once without specifically looking for them. Emotionally, I feel deeply relaxed and at ease. Due to this deep feeling of "everything is good", my concentration improves too, I can focus attention on one thing and let the background awareness handle others, without worrying that I can miss something else. This increased lucidity is so noticeable, that two people who meditate will recognize each other in a room full of people who don't. I don't know how much of this is a permanently acquired trait that lasts whether I meditate or not. I have a feeling that it slowly goes away after I stop meditating. Oh well, impermanence... ;) 

Not a permanent barrier, but definitely a negative factor. Samadhi, or ability to generate and maintain a certain context and mood, relies on power of will (along with other powers, such as imagination etc). The power of will is a direction of energy opposite to the desire of satisfaction/relief. So training to channel your energy into e.g. physical endurance exercises instead of habitually releasing it, will do miracles to your ability to deal with stress, to control your focus and therefore your perspective and your mood. 

More of these quotes can be found in Advaita Vedanta mail list archives. And then somewhere around 310-390 CE we see it used by the Yogacara founder Asanga in his Mahayanasamgraha: 

Consciousness is not an entity, it can't "do" anything like "observe" or "experience". Consciousness is the experience itself. No, it's not the meta-observer that observes other skandhas. It is strictly experience of objects and events, both ones based on actual sensory stimuli ("real") as well as ones based on mental processes ("imaginary"). 

No, Nirvana is not the goal of all Buddhists. According to Sakya and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist liberation methodologies can be divided in three major classes, corresponding to sentient being's mental capacity: 

As my teacher explained, whether we do or do not have freewill, when we drive the car, we must drive it well. Similarly, regardless of whether meditation is happening by itself, or "I" do it, it must be right meditation. Practically speaking, we can control our mind, we can choose whether to get angry or to let go, whether to break through our phobias or to give in, whether to tolerate pain or to give up. This is our choice. Similarly, we do have a choice of perspective: we can think we are sentient beings, having been born and destined to die, or we can generate the mind of nirvana. You always have choice, period. Buddha was a huge opponent of the no-free-will-type theories with their tendency to take away motivation to strive for Enlightenment. Now surely meditation is not about rigid control either. It's not about letting your mind run loose, nor is it about following an algorithm. Enlightenment involves losing the form, true, but it also involves developing tremendous will power. These are the two legs we walk on the path. 

Putting aside the doubts whether you're close to Enlightenment or not... Or even if there is such thing as "Enlightenment"... And whether Enlightenment is something that can be attained by "me" at some point, and then retained for ever... And whether someone enlightened could still have questions about what to do and how to behave... In other words, assuming your question is valid, When you get "enlightened" you lose your reference point. So it may be hard to decide what's good / what's bad anymore. "What do I want? What should I do? Should I do anything at all?" -- nothing seems right or wrong by itself, in some sense it's all invented by people. Nothing is important, nothing is serious, all this stuff that normal people engage seems pointless. Hence the question about "how to behave in society" - did I get this right? I hope so. There are two parts to an answer my teacher gave me when I asked. First, regarding your own purpose and meaning of life. From the perspective of the Absolute Truth, you are free. You can literally do anything. If you want to play games, you can play games. If you want to drink yourself to death, you can drink yourself to death. If you want to go to other worlds, you go to other worlds. If you want to teach, you can teach. If you want to do nothing, you can do nothing. There is no reason to sit and worry what's the "best" thing to do, because there is no "best" thing to do, they are all equally pointless in the big scheme of things. In fact, the best thing to do is probably to arbitrarily choose any idea X that you like, and be totally serious about it, as if it was indeed a serious thing you believed in. However, from the perspective of life here on planet Earth, actions lead to results. What you do and say has effect. And all the people around you still feel pain, they still have their lives. If you stand up and walk out of class, this may look harmless to you, and the teacher's frustration may seem funny and unjustified (in the big scheme of things) - however, by doing that you're setting bad example to other students and you are making the teacher unhappy. So even though everything is free and empty, you just created a little island of chaos and suffering in your immediate locality. See what I mean? So the best way to function in society, is to always, always, always be mindful of the perspective of others. What will they feel? How will this affect them? Will this action lead to peace and harmony for others or will it lead to conflict and negative mindstates for them? By combining these two principles -- the absolute and the local -- we arrive at the enlightened behavior: combination of spontaneous freedom with no reference point, and tremendous empathy/responsibility for everything you touch in your spontaneous dance. 

As per the "Heart Sutra in 8000 Lines", you liberate all sentient beings by attaining direct realization that in fact there are no any such "sentient beings" to talk about. "Sentient being" is only a nominal designation. Two keywords to study are anatta (sanskt., anatman) and shunyata. Now, as a practice of paramitas (of generosity, forbearance, renunciation, loving-kindness, and equanimity), the commitment to staying in samsara and deferring one's own liberation until all sentient beings attain nirvana, requires complete surrendering of one's antipathy to samsara and craving for peace, complete surrendering of one's ego - which (the surrendering) paradoxically becomes the gate to Realization. 

Nirodha is usually translated as "cessation", as in "cessation of suffering", the third noble truth. In a more general sense, Nirodha is often used as a synonym of Nirvana. Digging deeper, Nirodha doesn't mean passive cessation (as in something ceasing by itself), but rather actively suppressing, controlling something. For example, suppressing a criminal by isolating him. In modern Hindu, a language descended from Sanskrit + local vernaculars, nirodha is a word for condom. From this we can understand, that cessation of suffering is not an automatic result of the Realization, but a skill one can master. Digging even deeper, to the question if there is anything above Nirvana, Mahayana gives a clear answer that Nirvana is really just the other side of Samsara. Somewhere midway between confusion and enlightenment, one is supposed to realize that "bodhi and nirvana are hitching posts for donkeys" (to quote Linji, the founder of Rinzai school). In this sense, Nirodha can be seen as true liberation from any form, beyond all duality, including liberation from the very concept of liberation. 

First off, you can't "see things for what they are", because "things" not "are" in any single way. The way things are is always context dependent. As much as we may want to see things from superhuman objective perspective, we can't escape a point of view. Now, if we understand that there is no truly objective point of view then we may get close to seeing things as they are, which means accepting our necessary limited perspective as part of "how things are" -- but not being fooled by it! IMO, your assuming that you currently see things as they are is conceit and delusion. Now, individual points: The symbolism of bowing is making yourself vulnerable to the person you're bowing to. This is like handshake in which you show you have no weapon, but taken to the next level. Basically, by bowing you're saying "my life is in your hands". It would seem like it makes no difference if you already have respect for the person, but you have no idea how deep the egoistic resistance runs its roots. Try laughing authentically in front of a group of people you don't know and you will see what I mean. Similarly, bowing sincerely requires breaking through our false pride. And if you don't have pride anymore, bowing becomes expression of your understanding of the significance of Dharma and how it is manifested by Sangha, along with your gratitude to the Buddha. Again, it's like you are saying: "Thank you Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha -- I'm glad to have you be the force that guides my life, and I would like to keep this connection alive" Regarding beauty and pleasure, Buddha taught us to train to see pleasant in non-pleasant and non-pleasant in pleasant. Only then can we be free from the dictate of "things as they are". You will not hear monks finding beauty in what most people consider beautiful. Back in the day when nature was prevalent, and people praised castles and statues, monks praised a bird flying off a branch. This was expression of their ability to find beauty anywhere. These days the beauty of nature has been romanticized and became popular, which is why it seems like monks were simply indulging, but they were not. To summarize, it is not about seeing things as they are, it's seeing things in a useful way. 

Purely subjectively, to me, it looks like DN suttas are rather artificial compilations, followed closely by MN suttas. Of these two DN suttas seem the most contrived - none of them look like Buddha's direct words to me but rather like nice and clear summaries assembled from Buddha's quotes with some glue added for smoothness. Samyutta and Anguttara Nikayas are very different from the above, esp. Anguttara feels like an anthology of raw quotes as close as it gets to Buddha's own words. My speculation is that Nikayas were created not with specific audiences in mind, but rather by following four very different methodologies. Perhaps DN were created as all-encompassing summaries of the entire teaching across wide range of Buddhist topics, by people who believed that the raw unedited teaching was too fragmented and incomprehensible to most people. MN was seemingly made by picking the points that were most often debated by the non-Buddhist sects and creating nice clear arguments against them. SN feels like a result of an enormous effort to organize the quotes by topics, by people who must have believed in the power of reason. AN seems like a simple collection of all kinds of quotes by rather practical people who believed in K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, stupid). KN is various useful and not-so-useful Buddhist folklore that is not made of Buddha's quotes. Naturally, the methods and attitudes of the compilers reflected in the suitability of this or that collection for certain audience. But I don't think they were specifically intended for different audiences, no.
