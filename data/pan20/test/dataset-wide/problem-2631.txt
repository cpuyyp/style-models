All of these, and others, work. And all of them are very hard to accept without a better philosophical basis than the need to solve this issue. So you have traded no answer for too many answers, and since all of them feel silly, at first blush, you are in no better stead. It remains true that logic in the thoroughgoing classical sense cannot be right about our notions of containment, universality, and negation all as we naively understand them. Some part of our natural model is not naturally correct. The paradox is then what part of your naive and natural understanding you want to discard in order to feel safe, and how we can achieve agreement on something so basic, so that the evolution of math can move forward. And it is no easier to solve than the original problem. The modern 'solution' has been to bring up all of these solutions and impose one of them by force of numbers -- a bizarre political process alien to the notion of mathematics itself. 

You may want to back off to the original meaning in Aristotelian wording, and then rephrase it in possible world semantics. [][]A or <>[]A or []<>A in a more direct interpretation means 'It is necessary that A is necessary' or 'It is possible that A is necessary' or 'It is necessary that A is possible'. But 'For all x in X, for all y in X' just means 'For all x and y in X' whether X is the class of possible worlds, or just a mundane and ordinary set. So directly stacking modes is stacking up pointless quantifiers. All the 'Necessaries' or 'Possibles' collapse, and any 'Possible' eats any 'Necessary' inside it, just the way 'For all' and 'There exist' work when they are not quantifying over worlds. 

(You proposed the alternative phrasing "Are there any practical or pragmatic systematic methods to check for contradictions?" and some of this makes more sense in that context.) The problem is that depending on the kind of system, you have lots of different answers: Basic Combinatorics says 'Yes, there is one that runs finitely long in most useful, realistic systems' because they tend to be reducible to a set of finite cases by combinatorial tricks. But Complexity theory says if "practical" is to mean anything, then 'Probably not, the running time of such things (logical constraint satisfaction algorithms) is often NP-complete.' In the other hand, the experience of Optimization Theory says "Usually, because NP-complete problems often have polynomial time heuristics that guess most real cases correctly." More abstractly, Computer Science says 'No, not in most cases that model real languages.' because of Turing's theorem on the halting problem. Even more abstractly, First Order Logic says 'Definitely not if your language tries to model the whole of math" because you have Godel's work referenced in the first answer. But proofs in Second Order Logic can rescue most of the domains of classical mathematics, and say "yes", for cases even as robust as the Real Numbers and Classical Geometry, as long as they cannot talk explicitly about themselves. So without knowing what your motivation and intention really is in some detail, we can only guess which kind of answer makes sense. And even then, the mathematicians would be more useful. 

This is basically one of Aquinas's arguments. It is only valid based on the Aristotelian physics he was using. And in the end he comes down against it. He widens the logical gap in Aristotle with some vocabulary, and uses it as a place to insert a proof of God. Even under Newton, forces can be equally balanced and the determinants of those forces can also and so forth and so on. Newton himself believed in a certain determinism, but in deciding that he relied way too much on the convergence and continuity of functions. He has a basic assumption that all of calculus applies to all circumstances. But our modern view of calculus is that real functions of motion may often not be smooth enough for its products to be well defined. Even any useful complex functions (the most staid and predictable domain) beyond polynomials have poles and essential singularities forced on them -- one can imagine that knowing the value of some attribute lies in a tiny region wherein the function takes values of every magnitude can be done deterministically, but in my book that is presuming the conclusion and then just insisting on it. From a more classical viewpoint, if one is intellectually honest, the only way out of Zeno's paradox is nondeterminism. What happens when things are in perfect balance depends on some higher moment, (or influences from farther away or farther back in time) and if those are balanced, it depends on a higher one still. Aquinas' answer to Zeno's paradox (in the First Way) is God, Newton's was uniform infinite differentiability of functions that are reciprocally or iteratively defined (which many mathematicians consider unlikely). In my book, both are cheating. Ours, now, is generally nondeterminism. Motion is possible because the lack of motion is impossible, and that mandatory motion, is at its root, utterly random. Even if physics were determined entirely by mathematics, from this perspective the math itself is not really strong enough to support a deterministic worldview in complex situations. We can make approximations, but they become bizarre and break, fairly easily, and then we just assume there are better approximations because it is in our experience that this is what works. But the math does not say there are really better ones to make. It just says you can insist further as much as you want. Really a lot of things remain undefined. At small enough scale, Heisenberg suggests, it may even be required that they remain undetermined. It is nice to suppose the world is really like humans naturally imagine it, but we need to pay some attention to the data. 

At the risk of pursuing peace when all sides want war, you need some sense of what you mean by a cause. Many things have multiple causes, but in some sense you have to choose a cause to be the 'most concrete' cause in a given circumstance. You need to choose a relevant point of leverage for language, or all such distinctions become circular. Consider thermodynamics. We can look at it in many ways. We can think of it as being about heat as a force, or about temperature as a measure, or about the distribution of 'microstates', or as the side-effects of the molecular motion that cannot be fully described. Each perspective focusses on the notion of cause differently. You can choose one of these and declare all the others wrong, or you can admit they all amount to the same thing. If you take the view that separates them, you quickly descend into absolute nonsense. This is the path that theory of mind seems to want to take. They all want to choose one of several basically equivalent viewpoints and create bizarre word games to claim the alternatives are not equivalent, for reasons of historical pride. If we look at the versions of thermodynamics, we can map them vaguely onto theories of mind "Heat as a Force", maps onto a straight functionalism -- we are concerned with effects and making engineering work, and we see inputs as causes, ignoring the detail that allows the energy transfer to take place. We see this interpretation just fails to give us any reasonable grasp of where some of the heat goes, but that is just life. The force of heat is the idealization of heat energy into a causal force. "Microstates" maps onto emergentism -- we don't want to delve into what causes statistical variations in the distribution of energy, even though we need to look at it as energy and deal with the distribution of that energy as it is transformed back and forth from this form to and from kinetic and other stored forms. We have just enough handle to do the math right in our engineering, and we stop there. Microstates are the mechanism of emergence of heat energy, with entropy and information as other potential 'multiple realizations'. Molecular motion maps onto materialism -- we see how the more complex phenomenon might be reduced to a more concrete observed phenomenon, and we are willing to believe it is totally explained by that more basic physics -- even though we can't do the math in most cases. So there is a bit more faith here than we might really be comfortable with. Molecular motion is the systematic reduction of heat energy to simpler physics. That leaves the "transmission of temperature" model to map onto epiphenomenalism -- we know that temperature represents the quantity of something, and that if we trace the temperature as it travels, we can account for most of what is going on. But we also know that temperature is not causal, it is not a force, just the trace of one. Temperature is the basic epiphenomenon of heat energy. We can agree that it does not cause anything, but is always and everywhere an effect of some cause we don't want to trace any deeper. It has no effect, it only accompanies effects. Temperature then behaves quite like the thing you complain is 'singular'. Making neither of them 'a phenomenon completely unlike anything else in the world'. (Especially since any good science teacher can probably do this same breakdown for four or five rather old domains from electricity to acidity that have gone through a succession of equivalent models, and these same four stable positions are easy to identify in finance and psychology, as well.) So there is no element of 'singularity' or other awkwardness involved. We know that consciousness traces causal activity, as temperature traces whatever you want to describe heat via. Consciousness is there when there is a mental cause, but we don't see how it can be the cause itself, because it does not seem to be structured in a way that other causes in our world are. This is very much the same way temperature is a very clear indication that traces when heat effects occur, but is not very directly converted into any field or kinetic measure that reliably works with the rest of physics.
