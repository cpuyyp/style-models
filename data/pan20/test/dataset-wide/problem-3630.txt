Multiple hills with comparable or steeper grade, but much shorter: maybe 200 ft climb max. I can repeat these hills in quick succession. This trail is just a few minutes from my home and I can visit it several times a week One large hill, 500 ft, but it is much steeper (15% grade) and more technical, it's a good challenge uphill but seems difficult to run back down it in a safe matter. I spend a lot of time walking on this hill. I can only make it to this trail occasionally 

Are repeated climbs on a small hill comparable to a single climb up a larger hill, in terms of training for miles-long climbs in the race? 

You don't need to "go easy" by sticking to softer surfaces, whether barefoot or in minimal shoes, and by doing so you are likely to miss a lot of key lessons about proper form as the surface is more forgiving. Just a few runs on pavement or gravel can really fine-tune your form and teach you how to run efficiently and avoid injury. These lessons will apply to minimalist shoes and cushion shoes too. I like to do a few miles barefoot at the beginning of a long run to fine-tune my form, on a variety of surfaces including asphalt or gravel, and this carries over nicely to the main part of the run performed in Vibrams. Regarding overpronation I'm not an expert about this, but I think focusing on form could help a lot as you spend more item in minimalist shoes. I developed knee pain earlier this year due I'm pretty sure to overpronation and a tight hip flexor, even while wearing minimalist shoes. By focusing on form I've nearly eliminated the problem. Occasional barefoot running has taught me to increase my cadence a little more, correctly align my hips and feet, land more lightly, and run downhill properly—even while wearing minimalist shoes or traditional shoes. This has nearly eliminated my pronation and knee problems. Regarding sore feet 

Can't say anything about the twitching issue you're having, or what's causing it - that's something for a physiotherapist. As far as pinching/spreading your shoulder blades goes - you should be retracting your shoulder blades for both the squat and deadlift - as in imagine trying to hold a pencil in between them. This creates tightness in the upper back and prevents your back from rounding during the lift, and allows you to drive from your hips. Spreading your shoulder blades leads to a loose and rounded back, which is not what you want to do. The idea of creating tightness in your upper back, along with bracing your core is about protecting your spine and creating stability and efficiency for a safe lift. If it's hurting, something isn't right. Stop and get it checked out. 

And one last note - I always shaved down on the morning of the meet. Whole body. Those shaving cuts serve as real motivators to get to the finish! 

It sounds like you're off to a great start with minimalist shoes. The first rule is to start slow and increase usage gradually, and you have done so. The shoes Make sure the shoes fit perfectly. You can get blisters and pain in minimalist shoes pretty easily, especially on long runs, if they don't fit perfectly or you're not wearing them correctly. Also, if the shoes don't fit snugly and conform to your feet, you will miss a lot of feedback and your proprioception will suffer, thus increasing the chance of pain or injury. My first pair of Vibrams were too large and I would constantly get blisters due to some parts of the shoe chafing the skin. I had to almost always wear toe socks with them. The second year I made sure the shoes fit better, and since then they have been more comfortable, and I no longer wear socks with them. I still occasionally get some sore spots around the heel or side of the foot on long runs. Focus on running form Never be complacent with your running form. Constantly monitor your form and do some reading. It isn't just "run on the balls of your feet" (actually, my heels touch the ground lightly near the end of my step), there are a lot of subtle details about your form that can continually be improved. You don't get perfect form and prevent injury just by putting on minimalist shoes or going barefoot, just like traditional running shoes don't by definition cause injury. Minimalist shoes do make it easier to learn and maintain good form because they don't mask the impact of bad form as much as a cushion shoe. I started running completely barefoot this year and read the book Barefoot Running Step By Step. I realized that while Vibrams do give you a lot more feedback than cushion shoes, and thus help encourage better form, there's still a significant difference between that and going barefoot. In retrospect, I've realized that I was being too be hard on my feet and joints in minimalist shoes. In previous years, my feet and joints would ache after a long run in minimalist shoes, but this year, after some significant improvements to my form, I feel tired but refreshed after a long run in minimalist shoes, with no unnecessary aches or pains. At this point, since you've done a good transition in to minimal shoes and are already logging 5 mile runs, if you aren't just tired but hurt after a long run in minimalist shoes, then there's likely something you can improve with your form. Yes, the transition to minimalist shoes can involve some muscle and foot soreness as your body adapts, but don't be a hero and push through pain. Barefoot training From the Vibram FAQ: 

The dive - Sets you up for a good sprint. Work on getting speed and distance off the block, and your streamlining/speed under the water up to the maximum legal distance. Not sure what it is these days, but when I completed it was something like 15m underwater...Improving your butterfly/dolphin kick here is important - remember that you travel faster under the surface than you do on it. DO NOT take a breath as you surface - you'll drastically lose speed. The first lap - explosive, but pace yourself. This is where you'll focus on technique - You'll need every bit of energy for an all effort on the last lap. As many strokes as possible before taking the first breath, and then as many as possible in between breaths - a minimum of 4 strokes/breath was my aim. Try to get as far as possible with each stroke. And kick - use those legs. The Turn - Fast and efficient, and set up for getting good power off the wall for fast underwater movement up to the legal distance - same as the dive. Again, do not take a breath right before the turn, nor as you surface coming out of the turn. The last leg - all out effort. No time to focus on technique (nor your competitors) here, it's all or nothing. Again, as many strokes as you can between breaths, and get those legs moving. Hitting the wall. Literally. Power through your last few strokes and finish with an almighty reach to punch through that wall. Don't back off - let the wall stop you. 

Again, don't overdo it. If after some time you can't seem to get past a certain number of miles in minimalist shoes without this problem, then you may need to seek a more experienced opinion than mine. Also, if the top of your foot gets sore, then you may need to tweak the way you wear and lace your shoe, or possibly consider a different type or size of minimalist shoe. Because they fit small and snug, there can be a lot of pressure on the top of the foot from the laces or straps. Added in 2014: These days, there are many styles of “minimalist” or zero heel drop shoes. I have found that the feel and fit can vary dramatically among brands and styles, and is a very personal choice. Especially with ultra-minimal shoes, it is essential that it fits well and feels comfortable; these shoes tend to amplify any problems with fit. If soreness or other problems are persistent with Vibrams, try a different style, perhaps a zero-drop shoe with more substantial construction and cushioning. As long as it’s comfortable, I have found that bulkier ZHD shoe works basically the same way biomechanically. Next steps I think you can continue to gradually increase the distance you run in your minimalist shoes. I was able to complete 12 mile runs in my first year with no problem, and 16 miles the following year, and it sounds like you're in better shape than I am (I've never attempted a marathon for example). The “transitioning tips” bullet points at the end of the Vibram FAQ sound like good guidelines. There should be no problem with wearing other shoes for some portion of your runs until you get to the point that you're ready and willing to use minimalist shoes or go barefoot 100% of the time. In the first two years I used traditional running shoes on roads, and I still use heavier shoes during the winter months. When you run in your other shoes, try to imagine that you're in minimalist shoes and apply the form you use there in your other shoes. This can only work to a certain degree of course, but that could help you maintain your form. You may find that you will be running better in both types of shoes. My background I started running with minimalist shoes 2 1/2 years ago, and by the end of that year I was doing 90% of my runs in Vibrams (excluding winter runs in snow). This year, I added true barefoot running to the mix, doing that about 30% of the time now. Before getting into minimalist shoes, I wore a variety of cushion shoes from the basic road shoes to some pretty heavy duty trail shoes. 

You said you don't have a trainer/coach, but my advice is to seek one out, preferably one who competes as well. I say this straight up because you also said you want to win a local powerlifting competition. I also have 7 weeks to my next powerlifting competition, but I'm a month into my training run, and my coach has written me a brutal program with a good mix of heavy and volume. A coach will assess your technique, your abilities, and movement patterns, so they can tailor a training program specifically for you. As an example from my experience - the very first session I had with my coach, my deadlift went from 160kg to 180kg, just from tweaking my technique. That said to me that I had strength, but my form needed improvement. That being said, if you can't access a coach, there are plenty of existing programs that have good results, like Stronglifts/Starting strength at the beginner level, and mad cow or Wendler 5/3/1 for intermediates. Whatever you choose to follow, make sure you are consistent, and that you add weight to the bar each week - start light, otherwise you'll plateau quickly. Work on improving your form - film yourself so you can critique your lifts. Conditioning is also important, make sure you get some in. I like to use high-rep training for this. Leading into the comp, work up to heavy singles in your last week beforehand, with a little bit of back-off work, and leave 2-3 days to recover before the big day. But probably more important than the time spent in the gym is your time spent out of it - nutrition and recovery is where you will get your gains. Eat big and focus on recovery. Good luck. 

In hindsight, I think this is key. Running barefoot on a road (and even on gravel) will maximize the sensory input to your feet. You'll feel every nuance of your form: 

I live in an area with small hills. How do I make the most of these hills when training for a trail race with much larger hills? One of my favorite races is a 15-mile trail race with 3000+ ft (900+ m) total elevation climb. There are three big uphill segments, 1–3mi (1–5km) long, 500–800 ft (130–230m) climb with grades of 7–10+%. I'd like to improve my hill training in preparation for this year's race. The best two options I have in my area are: 

A trail race may have hills that are too steep to run up easily. Or, one may choose a strategy to hike all significant climbs early on in a long distance race. When choosing to hike up a hill in a running race, is there a specific form or technique that is optimal? For example, what sort of posture should one have? Is there a specific stride length/cadence to aim for? Should you brace your hands on your knees to "push" uphill? etc. Is there a simple rule to determine when it is better to hike rather than run up a given hill (in terms of energy conservation/recovery/not wasting time)? Or if there are multiple hiking techniques or speeds that apply to different situations, is there a strategy for knowing which to use in a given situation? 

The opposite to a pull is a push/press. So an opposing movement for pullups would be any kind of overhead press movement. The opposing movement for pushups would be any kind of horizontal rowing movement. 

Hard to say without knowing your physical attributes, your technique or training program....But shaving 10s off in 9 months is a big task for anybody. I can only make these suggestions based on my own experience - training (lots of it), a good coach, and attitude/perseverance. Sleep and nutrition helps too. I competed at state and national level in my youth, and my best at 16 was 54.9s for the 100m free. I'm not a tall bloke - 175cm, weighed about 55-60kgs at 16, so not a big bloke either. I trained about 8-9 times a week - both morning and night, both at club and school. Some sessions would hit the 10km mark. Club races on the weekend. My training consisted of lots of sprint work, heart rate sets, some distance/endurance work, and dry-land strength work. And a good taper period before a state/national meet. The 50m and 100m are explosive movements - you'll need to improve your technique, your stroke efficiency (distance per stroke), but probably more importantly your kick (both power and endurance). It's hard to perfect form in an all-out sprint, but for me, the breakdown was this: 

A technique that has proven useful to me is to run barefoot on pavement and gravel. The roughness of the surface maximizes the sensory input to your feet, and the hardness of the surface calls attention to any excessive impacts or inefficiencies further up the foot/leg/knee/hip joints. I often run the first mile or two of a workout barefoot on pavement as a way to maintain a "muscle memory" of good form. You can start by standing on the pavement or gravel, getting a feel for what the surface feels like "at rest", and then walking in place for a few steps, then bouncing and jogging in place, and then begin moving forward. As you transition from standing to moving in place to running, pay attention to how the surface feels on the soles of your feet, how your feet are landing and lifting, how your muscles and joints feel. I've found that even very small adjustments in foot placement, hip movement, knee bend, cadenece, etc., are can be measured by watching for changes in the level of comfort or pain felt on these sorts of surfaces. But this is a rather subjective technique that I think is only useful in conjunction with learning about good form from other sources, etc. Thus I would be very interested in seeing a more thorough answer than this that describes some more objective techniques to self-assess running form.
