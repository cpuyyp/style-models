The simple answer is yes, local policies apply to all users on the machine. You should review the Microsoft Group Policy precedence carefully to understand how policies are applied. With that said, there's rarely a good argument for using Local Group Policies in a domain environment. 

You absolutely can set a static IP on the HP T5740 - in fact, for the most part, they work just like full fat Windows. What problem are you having? I presume you've been logging in as admin and committing / disabling the write filter? 

One Domain and Forest should be fine, with separate organisations assets split into separate Organisational Units. You may choose to separate domain controllers across physical locations, depending on your WAN capabilities. That said, regardless, you simply must have 2 Domain Controllers at least in your Domain, having no redundancy for your AD is suicide. 

First things first, all security should be managed using NTFS permissions on the folder and share (Remember, these are 2 sets of permissions and are mutually exclusive) itself. To do this you'll need security groups, and there is no way round that. Not mapping somebody to a drive is not 'security'. Secondly, to MAP the drives, I'd be using Group Policy Preferences. As above, it won't handle the file and folder permissions, but it will let you map drives very easily and cleanly. Finally, the beauty of Group Policy Preferences is that if your environment suits it, they will allow to you use 1 single GPO to map many different shares for many different users, using item level tar targeting to filter based on OU, Security Groups etc. Seriously, if you've just moved to 2008 (And I kind of hope you meant 2008 R2 seeing as 2008 is already now 2 editions old) then read up on Group Policy Preferences. Oh, you may need to patch any XP / 2003 clients to get them to work. 

I have a network appliance which contains some load balancing features - in my design, these features are only for use internally within the appliance. Nothing should EVER speak to them externally and, additionally, the client is low on IP addresses in the devices IP range. Would it be acceptable to use the Link-Local range for these features? For example, . NB: The device in question won't allow loopback IP's to be used for these features. 

This may not be a technical answer, but I personally always prefix server names with some form of site code. It can, admittedly, make the FQDN a little unweildy especially if the domain name is similar to the prefix, but perhaps something like this: 

Your router may not support using SNMP to monitor it, but I can assure you it will support SNMP in the sense of passing through data. SNMP sits in the Application Layer - your router doesn't care about that, only Layer 3 stuff. 

I'm struggling to find any metric where Windows Network Load Balancing would lose out to an F5 - with the exception of cost and maybe ease of management. But, if you've got a real Load Balancer sat there ready to use then I can't imagine any reason for not using it. 

I'm not with you - "Hide and Disable all items on the desktop" does what it says on the tin. It hides and disables all items. If you just want a few to show up then you'll need to disable that setting and configure your desktops accordingly. 

Assuming you have outbound internet access with no proxy, then you could disable "Automatically Detect Settings" and take a copy of the following reg key: DefaultConnectionSettings in HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections\ Then configure as required for production and take another export. You can then switch them using a script at the appropiate times. Bear in mind that most Proxy related configurations are stored in various keys HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ This includes the actual proxy itself, and exceptions etc 

iSCSI runs over TCP/IP which means all the normal rules of networking apply. A crossover cable would work fine. That said, this does defeat many of the end goals of shared storage and ESXi. For example, no vMotion. As it's a homework thread, I'll let you investigate why. Also, you remove the ability to allow other devices to see the SAN in the future. 

The first thing you should know is that Active Directory and DNS are so intertwined that they're almost one. For all intents and purposes, you should forget the idea of having an Active Directory domain which doesn't have a primary DNS server for Windows clients. I won't say it's "impossible", but I will strongly advise you that it's a path with only pain. As an alternative, why not let AD and DNS do their thing together and then add forwarders to your normal DNS servers. It's the same end result, you can basically forget about your Microsoft DNS server as it will just plod along doing its own thing as you actively maintain and update your other Name Servers. 

Why do people insist on hard coding links instead of using relative paths? There are products which will do a bulk find and replace in a folder which would be more of a maintainable long term solution. 

Almost certainly not, but if you have backups (Which you do, don't you?) and it's not mission critical and you can get a KVM to bail out if you need to then I'd just go for it. Problem with this question is that's its pretty niche as of now and the only way someone will know for sure is if they try it. As an aside, and this is controversial, I'd always avoid in place upgrades in production. I'd much rather start fresh with a brand new OS. You could also run a test using VMWare Workstation, first. 

You can then select that whole column, copy and paste it notepad and voila - a batch file which will do what you need. 

This caught me out today as I've never utilised MMC in this way. To get back to the console, you can use the "Window" menu item at the top. You'll also notice that the MMC Snap-In is a Window within a Window - you can use the controls to minimise the one you're 'stuck' in to get back to the base console. 

It would generally refer to the practice of running a Type 2 hypervisor on top of Windows, with some kind of Virtual Machine running inside. An example would be VMWare Workstation. You install the VMWare Workstation software onto Windows and then, within that, VMWare simulates another machine. For example, you may be running Windows 7 but choose to install Ubuntu inside. This is very different to running a Virtual Machine on a Type 1 hypervisor, such as ESXi. ESXi is an Operating System in it's own right which you install onto your machine. However, you can't use ESXi for anything, you have to install a Virtual Machine on top of it. One (rather confusing, but important here) exception here would be Microsoft Hyper-V. This comes with Server 2008 as an extra role but is actually classed as a Type 1 Hypervisor. Despite the fact that it's managed within Windows Server, it shouldn't ever be confused as a product like VMWare Workstation. I'd suggest having a read of the following: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ You may also choose to download a demo copy of VMWare Workstation. It's actually fairly straightforward to get started with and have a play. 

Yes, that's a classic SQL injection attack. Your only real long term defence is to secure the application, though you can ban IPs as required and there are various tools out there which will attempt to automate this. Ultimately, unless it becomes a DOS attack, they should be relatively harmless if your site is injection proof. That side of things is more StackOverflow, though. 

What you're doing in heading down a route that will bring you nothing but pain, heartache and absolutely no sympathy from any support personnel. While you can join a Microsoft PC to a non-Windows Domain, there are few scenarios when this is actually a good idea. So, basically, what I'm saying is - don't do this. Build a Windows Server Domain Controller, not a Linux one. 

Catering sounds like a nice easy way to group machines / users, so in this instance, I would suggest that it would be much more transparent and maintainable to apply this to a Catering OU (Or OU's) or a Catering security group. Leave WMI filters for when you have no choice. In my experience, they're rarely used because there is generally a better way forward. 

Check this page: Start Menu -> Right Click on "Computer" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Computer Name -> Change This is your definitive answer on whether that machine is joined to a domain or not
