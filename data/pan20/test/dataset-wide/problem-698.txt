I am familiar with this problem and the efforts people go to in order to reduce back pain on the bike. Far too frequently people go for expensive stems and bars that climb skywards. Next thing they come back wanting to try something else. The problem being that their hands are no longer taking any of their upper body weight, every bump agitates their spine. It is possible to get an upright position where the weight balance is good, 'Dutch bikes' seem to manage it, retro-fitting a road bike or MTB is very tricky to get right. Have a look at other cyclists on the road and their posture, get your own idea of how to sit. Bars at seat height and close, i.e. short top tube and relaxed geometry, might be worth a try. This will not be optimum on big hills as you cannot do a lot out of the saddle, but for most roads this should be nice and comfy. Consider getting some old steel bike second hand that has this geometry style. Then you can adapt your proper bike if you like the 'old fashioned' setup. 

We all know the scenario - you buy the girlfriend a bike, you spend a day servicing a friend's bike, you give an old bike to someone in the family or you spend time in the LBS helping a friend get a bike. Your motivation is out of genuine enthusiasm and in the hope that they will enjoy cycling, maybe to become a life-long cyclist. As time goes by you realise that they have not really taken to the bike, it remains in the hallway/garage/shed and they still get around the old-fashioned way - walking, catching the bus or killing the planet with their noisy, cramped tin-box. Although you daren't say it, you might as well have not bothered. They are not going to go cycling any more than a leopard is going to change his spots. No amount of logic or reason will change matters. But... ...then there are some people you advise on a new bike choice that do get into cycling. Although they probably did not need you to help them get cycling, you still have played some part through 'setting an example'. In other walks of life it is possible to have success at introducing a newbie to 'something better'. For instance, where you can find someone wanting help with their badly rootkitted computer you can take all day to pull out the viruses or spend half an hour with the Linux install disk. Invariably they don't have a copy of Winmare 7 or find any signs they have joined the Mapple Cult next time you see them - they have accepted a big change despite having to learn-new-stuff (which is hard). Alcoholics Anonymous have '12 steps' structure and a dose of religion to wean people off drink. Ultimately A.A. face a similar problem to the lost-cause-of-cycling in that people are not going to change unless they want to, however structure works for some A.A. punters, in some cases, some of the time. Clearly this is an open ended question with many answers. Personal anecdotes are welcomed, did a childhood gift of a bike, a bike-to-work scheme or the advice of a doctor work for you? Is there anything that we can learn from other walks of life? Statistics and studies could also provide answers. Whatever hints and tips you have to help people take up cycling as a way of life are welcomed. Answers with lateral thinking, tips from other walks of life are also welcomed. Please mod up the better, more insightful answers. 

The saddle isn't just a point of contact for riding, it also gets to lean against walls when the bike is parked and maybe against the ground/floor (if the bike is in the ownership of a youngster). Naturally road bikes do not get thrown to the ground every five minutes, but, a BMX, or other child's bike, will. For this reason it is horses for courses, a quality seat for a BMX doesn't have to be comfy at all, a quality seat on a touring bike should not come apart when someone tries to lift the pannier-laden bike by the seat and a quality seat on an entry-level hybrid bike should survive wall-park abrasion. What amazes me is why there are something like 4096 different types of bicycle seat on the marketplace. Is that level of product diversity necessary? As for that talk of 'erectile dysfunction' being promulgated by bike seats and cycling, there is no way that can be true with modern saddles in the use of healthy-weight riders. Any talk of 'erectile dysfunction' is to be instantly dismissed as General Motors propaganda, as disseminated by the old-fashioned car-driving journa-fogeys at The Sun. Agree that old saddles had a problem as the pelvic bones were not supported, but you cannot get those older saddles anymore (unless you include the Brooks dead-cow and rivets efforts). 

H. P. - welcome to bikes.se and thanks for asking. One feature I have not seen on bike computers or iphone apps is a simple tool that tells you how much money you have saved through cycling. To drive a mile takes a certain amount of petrol/diesel and that depends on many factors. These factors can be approximated in a multitude of ways, so you can start off with a simple miles to the gallon factor then extend the model to take into account the start/stops, the speed, the weather (A.C. in summer), car engine size and so on. Some algorithm optimisations will not be that big a deal, others will be important to accuracy. The car data is also important. As well as efficiency there is also the depreciation, insurance and other costs. You could have ballpark figures for 'large saloon', 'small hatch', 'fullsize SUV' and so on. Also there is the difference in saving depending on whether or not the car is given up. Fuel prices change by the day and by region. Applying accurate prices to the data is another factor that can be approximated or accurately modelled. For instance, if we were to have another war or gulf hurricane then prices could go off the chart, so you can either model 'today's prices' or make the data tied into the price by date. Clearly this data needs to come from somewhere, either it is manually keyed in or else it gets it 'from the cloud' somehow. Ideally the app just needs to know what car you drive or what car you sold. After that it should be able to work out the rest. To what ends? You could have this data used by employers wishing to remunerate employees for cycling to work, you could also have parents that 'run a taxi service' make pocket money dependent on whether the kids cycle to school or not. As a spin off you could also measure Kg of CO2 saved by cycling. If the challenge of the above appeals to you then you could make an iphone/android app to do the above and sell it on the app marketplace, hopefully to make your efforts financially worth your investment in time. Hope that helps! 

Take a look at the models by Electra with a 24" wheel, find a stockist and get your lady friend to try one. Not the lightest but well specified and easy on the novice due to their geometry. Really anything with the 24" wheel makes sense for the 5'4" rider. Going smaller wheeled with a 20" wheel Dahon folder makes sense too, however, 20" wheel is a bit squirrelly in the park and the stretch to the bars can be borderline for the 5'2" female rider. Try one of those too. 

It is clear that this design is heavy, weakens the structural integrity of what was once a simple diamond frame, introduces bushes that wear, does the 'pedal bob' and complicates the maintenance. However, what is in it for the manufacturer? 'Horst Link' and other properly thought out suspension designs are patented, these patents cost money to licence, whereas the design discussed here is royalty free. It costs nothing apart from a few lumps of ugly metal. Not wishing to defend the design, however, it does have some benefits with 24 and 20 inch wheel children's bikes, providing a lower standover height and providing some protection for the back wheel from kerbs and other objects 'in the playground'. From a retailers perspective the differential between the non suspended and cheap suspended variant can be all of £10, which is £10 more in the till. The customer gets 'full suspension' for all of £10, which can be sold as a 'bargain'... 

You pedal with the ball of your foot and this should placed directly above the pedal axle. However, because you move your foot in a ~170mm radius circle altering the angle of your foot, 'directly above' moves back and fore through the pedal stroke. Getting the ball of the foot behind the axle is not desirable as you are then using the toes rather than the ball (or arch) of the foot to pedal with. Therefore, in practice, you need to have the ball of your foot approximately 10mm forward of the axle. Placing the ball of the foot 10mm forward of the axle helps during the bottom of the power stroke. You can push the pedal backwards through the dead spot. It also helps at the top of the stroke. IMHO if the toes are having to do all the work (and the cleats are too far forward) then you can tell on a climb - the toes want to give up on you, almost dangerously so... Alignment is also important. Ideally you want the cleats to be pointing forward with the left/right bolts in the same positions in their little slots on each shoe. This can feel 'pigeon toed' when you get on the bike and it does no harm to angle in the heels so long as there is clearance between them and the cranks. We all have variations in gait and this needs to be accommodated with a little bit of adjustment. On the subject of natural variations, we all have one foot larger than the other, sometimes this can be some margin, in many cases this can be a whole E.U. shoe size. In practical terms, if placing the cleat so that the ball of the foot to be 10mm forward of the axle, there should be no need to adjust relative cleat positions. As for determining exactly where the ball of the foot is, with an already worn shoe you can take the insole out and line it up with the sole. Otherwise you have to take an educated 'feel' from looking at your feet on the pedals. 

I recommend that you take a good look at the Park Tools workstands. They are designed to support a single bike securely with grips that are easy enough to setup and release. Prices may be more than a DiY 'bit of wood' sticking out the wall, however, the workstand will have extra value for when you want to work on the bike. Plus, a Park Tool stand looks good, even if not in the workshop and in your front room. Here are a few models that may be suited to your application: $URL$ 

That bike looks great as it is. Keep as is, if you do have a flat bar kicking around in the garage it will not do any harm to mention that you also have that for sale e.g. for a tenner and are prepared to swap the bars over for free. Fixies are supposed to be like single-speed track bikes and the drop-bar is part and parcel of the look if it is to be kept 'pure'. You do have to think of your market, you will be looking for a customer wanting the 'track-bike inspired faux messenger' look above a practical means of transport. You might want to keep the seat for your next rig. If you are to change anything see if you can pick up a red seat out of your LBS workshop's bin of spare parts or get a red seat cover for the seat that is on there. That will complete the look. 

Rollers. You have three drums, two at the back, one at the front and the front roller is powered by one of the back rollers. You can also get add ons to give you a breeze: 

This depends on the direction that they are running in. Due to bicycles being silent, cycling having priority in the bike lanes and runners not having eyes in the back of their heads, they should be running the 'wrong way', towards rather than with bike traffic. In that way they can hop out of the way of oncoming cycle traffic. Clearly there is no way short of public service broadcasts on television to inform runners on the correct etiquette for running in bike lanes. However, from a UK 'Highway Code' legal perspective, pedestrians are pedestrians whether they are crawling on all fours, walking with ipod plugged in or running 'narcissus' style. 

I have thought about this on several occasions, mostly at dusk with average quality lights on my bike and a car over-taking another car in the opposite lane. Yep, that is the 70 mph car heading straight at you, not looking for a bike, or even having the imagination to expect a bike coming the other way... I am alive today so therefore my up-until-now secret strategy has clearly worked (and yes I am touching wood immediately). Therefore I will share it with you. In normal life I am not a God-fearing Christian. In fact I have no imaginary friend of the omnipotent and omniscient nature lurking in some imaginary place somewhere above the sky (former schoolmates at GCHQ excepted). However, when I detect an 'incoming launch' (my secret phrase for a rather-large-and-heavy tin-box coming directly my way at Highway Code defying speed) I suddenly become religious. I utter 'Oh my God' and, in a blink of an eye, what was to be certain tragedy is magically avoidified. 'Jesus please save me' also works if my memory serves me correctly, but I am not sure of any other vocabulary that the skygod understands. My advice is to stick to one of those two phrases - I am living proof that this method is fool-proof. As a student I did lose a very religious friend to a tin-box with a heavy accelerator pedal. To this day I am lost for words regarding the loss of a coursemate that was so able, talented, decent to people and a cyclist. In my opinion his loss and the loss of others taken away by the tin-box people is harder to come to terms with than how other people 'make it upstairs'. No logic or reason can explain it and why there is no penalty of significance for the evil-wrong-doer in the tin box. 'Did not see you, mate' hurts, doesn't it? Anyway, faced with this loss I was not sure about whether or not my religious conversions at time of imminent death was really needed. All I could assume was that my former friend had given up on his faith at the time he needed the skygod the most. Maybe he said 'bloody hell' or something like that, rather than one of the two secret phrases that are known and guaranteed to work. Well, that can be the only explanation as I see it, the most logical, reasoned explanation anyway. Actually I have travelled quite a few yards on car bonnets, with the scars and smashed laptops to prove it. These were the occasions when things happened so quickly that even in slow-motion shock I did not have time to utter the magic words, but somehow got off lightly (i.e. alive). Somehow I never seem to bounce back onto my feet like the movie actors do after their ultra-violent scenes. I almost enjoy concussion and how people go weird on you, sending you off to A+E where they shine bright lights in your eyes and don't let you watch teevee (never understood that bit). During the soul-searching after an incident, where, obviously the tin-box person was entirely in the wrong, I have actually came to a realization that I could have done things to make things different. The importance of a bright front light cannot be under-estimated. The importance to assertively handle junctions cannot be under-estimated. The importance of making eye-contact with other road users cannot be under-estimated. The importance of not skirting round the outside of a roundabout in a cowardly manner cannot be under-estimated. You cannot show weakness or deference to the tin-box. You cannot afford to have loose clothing get caught in moving parts. So yes, there is a lot you can do to avoid the almighty killing machine that is the tin-box. Some of it is psychological approach to riding, the rest of it is getting bike and hi-viz together. Off-road mountain biking is a useful proving ground for accidents and their mitigation. One strategy that works surprisingly well is to take a direct hit, head on, wheels straight with no glancing-blow nonsense. Accidents seem tidier that way and the automatic response of sticking hands out works better as the crash is both wrists in mega-agony rather than one wrist broken. To conclude, don't forget the magic phrase and whatever you do, do not end up like my former college friend - people on SE might miss you, not to mention your mum and everyone else you know.
