Rabbits do not "consume their own waste". You are probably thinking of their rather unusual two-pass digestive system. Rabbits are herbivores, and like all herbivores they have had to evolve a solution to the problem of extracting enough energy from plant material, which is mostly cellulose. On the first pass the food goes into the cecum, which is like a much larger version of the human appendix, where it gets fermented by bacteria that break down the cellulose. It then emerges from the anus as moist round mucus-covered pellets called cecotropes, which the rabbit eats. On this second pass through the digestive system nutrition can be extracted from the fermented plant material, and the remainder is excreted as black feces. To us that sounds pretty icky, but its how rabbits have evolved, and although cecotropes come out of the anus they are not "waste" in any way. If you eat only rabbit meat for an extended period you will probably be malnourished because rabbit meat is very lean, and you need more fat than it can provide. But if you can compensate for that with other sources of fat then it shouldn't be a problem. 

As well as cultivating possible sources of information the KGB also tried to create positive publicity for the USSR. However this was much less successful. One exercise described by Gordievsky involved a group of sympathetic journalists from The Guardian being taken on a tour of the USSR. However the resulting coverage was so tepid that the KGB officer who had organised it had to fend off accusations of incompetence. 

The origin of the quote is this article in Harpers (there is an older version in a book, but everyone cuts-and-pastes the one in Harpers). It is used to lead in to a much longer article arguing for an end to the War on Drugs. Reporter Dan Baum states it was something said by Ehrlichman to him in 1994. There were no other witnesses, and there doesn't seem to be any other evidence that he said it. Ehrlichman died in 1999. This article in a conservative web site implies that the quote was fabricated, and quotes Ehrlichman's children as saying it is inconsistent with the character of their father. However their statements seem to miss the point; they defend Ehrlichman against a charge of racism, but this quote is not actually racist: rather it describes a campaign of dirty tricks that exploited racism in the general population. Ehrlichman spent 18 months in prison for his role in Watergate, and was subsequently barred from practicing law. He asked Nixon for a pardon, but didn't get one, and seems to have been very resentful about this. So its possible he said this, but it didn't accurately represent the thinking of the Nixon White House. There doesn't seem to be any other evidence to support the version of events in the Ehrlichman quote. Nixon wasn't shy about what got recorded on his tapes. This article goes through the relevant tape recordings and other evidence. Apart from the Ehrlichman quote, everything points to Nixon having an attitude of "My mind is made up, so don't confuse me with the facts.". Judging by the tapes, his policy was entirely driven by a fixed belief in then-prevalent myths about the danger to America from blacks, homosexuals, drug use and mental damage. Nothing there supports the picture drawn by the Ehrlichman quote that the WoD was deliberately fabricated as a strategy to disrupt political opponents. Instead the Nixonian WoD seems to have been a classic example of policy-based evidence making. 

In short, I can't imagine a reputable journal publishing something like this, and I won't be earthing my bed. 

I have not committed sin. I have not committed robbery with violence. I have not stolen. I have not slain men and women. I have not stolen grain. I have not purloined offerings. I have not stolen the property of the gods. I have not uttered lies. I have not carried away food. I have not uttered curses. I have not committed adultery, I have not lain with men . I have made none to weep. I have not eaten the heart [i.e., I have not grieved uselessly, or felt remorse]. I have not attacked any man. I am not a man of deceit. I have not stolen cultivated land. I have not been an eavesdropper. I have slandered [no man]. I have not been angry without just cause. I have not debauched the wife of any man. I have not debauched the wife of [any] man. (repeats the previous affirmation but addressed to a different god). I have not polluted myself I have terrorized none. I have not transgressed [the Law]. I have not been wroth. I have not shut my ears to the words of truth. I have not blasphemed. I am not a man of violence. I am not a stirrer up of strife (or a disturber of the peace). I have not acted (or judged) with undue haste. I have not pried into matters. I have not multiplied my words in speaking. I have wronged none, I have done no evil. I have not worked witchcraft against the King (or blasphemed against the King). I have never stopped [the flow of] water. I have never raised my voice (spoken arrogantly, or in anger). I have not cursed (or blasphemed) God. I have not acted with evil rage. I have not stolen the bread of the gods. I have not carried away the khenfu cakes from the spirits of the dead. I have not snatched away the bread of the child, nor treated with contempt the god of my city. I have not slain the cattle belonging to the god. 

Oleg Gordievsky was a KGB colonel who spied for the British. In his autobiography "Next stop execution" he writes about his work with "agents of influence" and "confidential contacts of influence". 

The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam contains nothing like this. There are a number of stanzas that refer to the futility of learning and how much better life is if you forget about it and just have a drink. But nothing that promotes humanism. For instance, from the 2nd edition of the Fitzgerald translation: 

It depends what you mean by "sold a chip". Intel designs, fabricates and sells a wide range of chips, so for Intel the answer is simple (they don't license out their designs). But ARM doesn't manufacture anything physical. ARM produces the designs for microprocessors. Actual manufacturers such as Broadcom then license the designs, integrate them with other special-purpose hardware (e.g. a cellphone modem and keypad encoder) and then sell the result. The details are confidential, but basically ARM gets a commission on each chip sold. So how many chips does ARM sell? It depends on whether you count the chips produced by their licensees. If you only count chips produced directly by ARM then the number is zero. If you count their licensees then the number is massive. In the 4th quarter of 2014 3.5 billion ARM-based chips were sold, which would mean around 14 billion per year. Meanwhile in Q3 of 2014 Intel sold "over 100 million" CPUs, which would mean over 400 million per year. I haven't found any total lifetime numbers for Intel processors, but if we guess that "over 100 million" in one quarter equates to 500 million per year, then it would take Intel 28 years to equal ARM's unit sales. Given the expansion of the PC market over the last few decades I doubt Intel was selling anything like 400 million processors in 1988, so the assertion is at least credible. Also note that this only counts Intel CPUs. Intel sells other types of chips as well. Of course Intel processors cost a lot more than ARM processors. Intel specializes in being the fastest thing you can buy. ARM specializes in being the best choice for low-power battery operated devices designed to a price point. A typical Intel processor (just chip, packaging and heatsink) costs more than most of the gadgets built around ARM processors. Thats why the Raspberry Pi uses an ARM.
