As others have noted, the essence of the Lagrange method is to convert a constrained-extremum problem into a form such that the FOC of the free-extremum problem can be applied. In your setup, you transformed the non-constrained problem ($\max u(x,y)$) to: $$ \Lambda = x^{\alpha} y^{1-\alpha} + \lambda (w-(xp_x+yp_y)) $$ If you assume that the restriction will be met, that is, that $xp_x+yp_y=w$, then the last term will vanish independently of the value of $\lambda$, so that $\Lambda$ will be identical to $u$. The trick is to treat $\lambda$ as an additional choice variable, thus maximizing $\Lambda(x,y,\lambda)$. Since the first order condition for $\lambda$ is $$ \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \lambda} = w-(xp_x+yp_y) = 0$$ we can be assured of the satisfaction of the constraint and the disappearance of $\lambda$. As for the interpretation of $\lambda_i$ (the Lagrange multiplier), in broad economic terms it is the shadow price of the $i$th constraint. In your setup, where there's only a budget constraint, the shadow price is the opportunity cost of the budget constraint, that is, the marginal utility of budget money (income). Another way to view it is that $\lambda$ measures the sensitivity of $\Lambda$ to changes in the (budget) constraint. In fact in can be proven that $$ \frac{d\Lambda^*}{dw}=\lambda^* $$ Notice that for this interpretation of $\lambda^*$ to make sense you must always express the constraint as $w-(xp_x+yp_y)$, not as $(xp_x+yp_y)-w$ (like you wrote on your setup). 

The variation that is being used to identify $\beta_3$ is basically the individual level deviations away from both the individual mean and average across individuals for the year. So to the degree that your variable of interest is varying over time but does not vary in a differential manner across individuals, you will fail to detect its effect. 

To be clear, when we say a unit fixed effect in econometrics, we are referencing any time invariant observed or unobserved determinant of the dependent variable. It's easy to show that all of these are "wiped out" by the individual level demeaning. The individual level demeaning also controls for the average differences in observed and unobserved independent variables across individuals. Individual fixed effects in the model mean that any source of bias must be time varying. Thus, if someone argues that your variable is endogenous on account of some variable that is constant in your sample, you have already controlled for that by only using variation over time to identify your point estimate. So with the inclusion of these individual fixed effects you can focus on determining time varying covariates that determine your independent variable. Time fixed effects will strip away any changes in variables that are the same for all individuals in a given period of time. For instance, if "individuals" are grouped together in the same state or municipality, and there are some changes in state or municipal policies for all individuals in that year,then the time fixed effects could strip away these effects without a need for measuring them. This only leaves concern over variables that have different time paths within different individuals. So with both time and panel fixed effects, to identify the effect of your variable of interest, exogeneity concerns aside, that variable of interest must 

Ah, this is a question I have struggled with. I think the answer depends wether you are intending to use the image in LaTeX or not. That said, in my opinion most answers provide good solutions (I've tried them all), but my recommendation is something that hasn't been mentioned: Inkscape: Inkscape is a free, open source software similar to Adobe Illustrator. It is very simple to create elegant vector graphics that scale up nicely. *Inkscape+PDFLaTeX: If you want to use LaTeX then you can use the same images created normally in Inkscape and then save them as PDFs using the option. This will produce a PDF with all but the text, which then can be rendered on top using the LaTeX engine. This has the advantages of 

I believe I know the precise definition of (quite a few) economic terms, but maybe Edesess is pointing out to some more profound mathematical foundations which I may not be familiar. Could someone expand on his argument and maybe even counter back? 

Maintaining font consistency between the surrounding text and the graphics' text. Greatly improving the typesetting pf mathematical text, which can be written "in code" in Inkscape and then be rendered correctly on the document. This is a great advantage over the non-LaTeX options. 

Different consumer preferences will lead to different properties of the consumer's willingness to trade one good for another. For instance, suppose that consumers preferences are linear in the consumption of either good: $U=\beta_x x + \beta_y y$ where $\beta_x$,$\beta_y$ are positive constants The marginal utility of $x$ would be $\beta_x$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $\beta_y$, and the MRS would be $\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y}$, also a constant. This tells us the consumer would be willing to trade between $x$ and $y$ at a constant rate. An alternative would be consumption of each good entering utility in a multiplicative fashion (Cobb Douglas), for instance $U=xy$. The marginal utility of $x$ would be $y$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $x$ and so the MRS would be $\frac{y}{x}$, which indeed would depend on consumption. In this example, the MRS decreases as consumption of $x$ rises. As the consumer enjoys more $x$ he is willing to give up less and less $y$ for another unit of $x$. So it's not entirely trivial whether the MRS depends on consumption, whether it does or not depends on how you model consumer's preferences. 

Say elasticity (of demand) gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price. Since the change is porcentual, if you are in a point of the demand where consumption is low, then a one percent decrease in price will result in a relatively big change in consumption, so elasticity is relatively high. As the quantity demanded increases along the demand curve, the percentage increase in quantity resulting of a one percent decrease of price will decrease. 

As a postgraduate student of economics I've been trying to expand my mathematical "toolset". While doing so I've talked to engineers, physicists and mathematicians, many of which have disdained the use of mathematics in economics. Their arguments vary, but one common theme is summed up by mathematician Michael Edesess' critique: 

Besides the one answer with a couple references, I haven't got anything else. I've been developing a model like the one posted on my question and I'm leaving here what I've found, in case anyone finds it useful. Now, developing a fully blown model is beyond the scope of a single answer, but I'll try to lay down my conclusions so far. Taking Dutta et al. (2007)'s model and expanding it with some simple assumptions to develop imperfect observability of actions among firms seems to show that "price wars" may be an inefficiently costly discipline mechanism in this setting, even when compared to other strongly symmetrical punishments. Not only the characteristics of continuations payoffs count, but also the actual discipline procedure matters. The reason for this is that when equilibrium "price wars" are used to enforce the agreement consumers will tend to delay purchase and wait until a bad realization of demand forces firms to switch phase to buy cheaper, undermining collusive profits. Broadly speaking, the fact that equilibrium "price wars" shift consumers' intertemporal incentives may have implications on the collusive outcome. 

have variation in within-individual time paths across individuals (i.e. individual heterogeneity, must be varying at $it$ not just homogeneous across $i$ within $t$.) 

Just thinking out loud here, not saying this is correct others may have a better idea. I'm going to roll with this assumption that you are using best econometric practices so that you trust your estimates and want to take action based on them. (1) The partial effect of going from $I=0$ to $I=1$ would be $E(Y_1|I=1,N=\overline{N})-E(Y_1|I=0,N=\overline{N})$ $=\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}\overline{N}$ When irrigation is already positive, the marginal effect of irrigation on yields just be $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I+\hat{\alpha_5}N$ (2) So you are curious what level of Nitrogen makes it so that the marginal effect of nitrogen is the same as the partial effect of irrigation? I think you could get at this by finding the $I^*$ and $N^*$ such that $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$? We've already found $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}$ above, so we need to calculate $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$ $=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I$ From here $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}|_{N=N^*,I=I^*}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}|_{N=N^*, I=I^*}$ $\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I^*+\hat{\alpha_5}N^*=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N^*+\hat{\alpha_5}I^*$ $\rightarrow (\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})N^*=(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*$ $\rightarrow N^*=\frac{(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*}{(\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})}$ I bet the optimal irrigation and fertilizer decision would equate the marginal product of fertilizer per dollar spent on fertilizer with the marginal product of irrigation per dollar spent on irrigation which would be $\frac{\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}N}{P_{irrigation}}=\frac{\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I}{P_{fertilizer}}$
