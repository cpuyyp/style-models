Compare the effective temperature of the stars with Planck's law, and with a light bulb (2000 to 3300 K): The color of a light bulb corresponds to spectral class L (red brown star) or class M (red star, including dwarfs and giants); violet, and some blue are missing. Light of Brown Dwarfs (spectral class T) would look red from their black body radiation, but due to their chemical composition the actual color may vary a bit over different tones of red. They would mainly feel hot, and look dull red at the same time, similar to glowing iron. Colors can hardly be distinguished under these lighting conditions. Some of the very hottest stars (spectral class O) may ressemble "black" light, looking bluish, and causing fluorescence due to to the shift of the spectrum into the ultraviolet, including x-rays. Without protective ozone/atmosphere layer, this wouldn't be healthy. This may apply to some degree also to spectral class B (blue white stars); plasma cores of lightnings are of a similar temperature (up to 30,000 K or more) as the effectve temperature of class B or class O stars. Any spectral class in-between (A, F, G, K) would look almost white, a little bluish for hot stars, yellowish for cooler stars, after some adaption of the eyes. 

It's exceedingly unlikely, that human-like species ever existed on Mars, from all we know thus far. It's very likely, that matter has been exchanged between Earth and Mars by asteroids, especially from Mars to Earth, and especially in the early solar system. It's very likely, that Mars was habitable for microorganisms in its early history, although there is no definitve evidence yet, that there ever existed life on Mars. We only know, that it could have survived for some time (millions of years), if it ever existed. But there are reasonable arguments, that there could have existed microbial life on Mars. A lot of effort is on the way to find evidence for this hypotheses. Hence it cannot be ruled out, that we have Martian ancestors. No observational evidence at all exits yet to verify this hyptheses. There are reasonable arguments, that there could be underground extant life on Mars, although no experimental evidence at all has been found until now. But probes to investigate this are planned. We didn't discover life on other planets, we are searching, and don't scare. 

HD 103774 b, detected by radial velocity, orbits a star of spectral type F5V according to The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopeadia. HD 102956 b, detected by radial velocity, orbits a spectral type A subgiant, the star of the "earliest" type harboring a planet detected by radial velocity, I could find (as of May 2014). The entry for Kepler-88 c around a spectral type B star (according to the catalog as of May 2014) appears to be incorrect, or encodes something else, the star should be classified as spectral type G6V. 

The precise presolar history isn't known. I'll try to tell a likely story backward in time. Our sun probably has brothers and sisters scattered throughout the Milky Way. Further back in time our sun likely was part of on open star cluster like the Hyades. Open star clusters are not stable and eject stars over hundreds of millions of years. (More about attempts to find Sun's siblings.) Such star clusters typically form in nebulae like the Orion Nebula. Dense nebulae typically contain short-lived stars with multiple solar masses, which typically end as supernova, adding heavy atoms to the nebula and surrounding interstellar medium. Our sun is rich in heavy atoms, easy to detect in spectral lines of sunlight or in solar wind; those atoms cannot have formed in the sun, because its core is not yet hot enough to form these elements; some will never form in the sun. Earth mainly consists of chemical elements heavier than helium. Stars like our sun, rich in heavy elements, are called population I stars (astronomers call all chemical elements besides hydrogen and helium metals). Population I stars (and Earth) can only have formed, at least in parts, from supernova remnants. Old stars, born in a time, when the immediate predecessor(s) of our sun were born, can still be found in the Milky Way. They are called population II stars. They contain less material made of heavy elements than our sun, but still more than provided by the big bang. Therefore there must have existed even older stars, called population III stars. Supernovae also can destabilize the interstellar medium due to shock fronts, eventually leading to local collapse especially of nebulae. Presolar grains are still raining down on Earth; "the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way". By this, the likely answer to the question is, that we probably consist of remnants of several supernovae, and of several generations of supernovae. 

The speed of light is 299,792.4580 km/s in vacuum, the speed at which light propagates, roughly 1.3 seconds from Earth to Moon. Velocity is distance divided by time; this applies also to the speed of light. 

Certain regions of the galaxy are more favourable for life, others less. Life takes some time to develop, and it needs chemical elements heavier than helium, e.g. carbon or silicon. To get sufficient time to develop, the solar system must not be disturbed too much by neigbouring stars. Therefore inner densely populated parts of the galaxy are less suitable than the periphery we are located. (The central star of the planetary system must not be too young, as well, to allow evolution.) Heavier chemical chemical elements are sufficiently abundant mainly in parts of the galaxy with relatively young stars (population I). This kind of stars is found mainly in the thin disk close to the galactic plane. Very old stars tend to expand, and may eventually destroy potential life on their planets, if they are surrounded by rocky planets at all. More discussion on a potential galactic habitable zone on Wikipedia. 

Quasars have very pointed jets perpendicular to the rotational axis of the accretion disc around the central black hole. As long as this jet doesn't happen to point into the galactic plane, the cosmic radiation of these jets won't be a too serious problem. But a collision of two galaxies can become an eventual problem in a different way. A merger of galaxies triggers star formation and sweeps most of the galaxy free of interstellar dust and gas. So, after a short (hundreds of millions of years) period of time, we'll get lots of new stars. But they'll eventually exceed their main sequence lifetime. Due to lack of interstellar matter only very few new stars will form afterwards. That's a difficult settings for formation of planets and life. 

Such observations are possible, see Fomalhaut b. It depends mainly on the diameter of the objective of the telescope (diffraction limit) and contrast. Telescopes can (at least in theory) be combined to an effective telescope of larger diameter (aperture) by interferomentry. Masks can help to occult bright stars to overcome the contrast limitatios. There are indirect methods to "see" faint planets, as e.g. applied in the Kepler mission, or by Gaia. And yes, it is calculable. With naked eye we wouldn't be able to distinguish the sun from the planet orbits from a distance of about 1000 lightyears, as the orion belt stars: 1000 lightyears are about 300 parsec. This means, that the earth orbit would be about 1/300 arc second. The resolution of the human eye is about 4 arc minutes, the 72,000-fold. For Pluto it's still more than 1000-fold. 

If we follow the Wikipedia definition of "celestial sphere", "the celestial sphere can be considered to be infinite in radius. This means any point within it, including that occupied by the observer, can be considered the center." Hence the question could be answered, as you presume, by in the center of the celestial sphere. Although, of course, if we aren't located in the center of the planetarium, the celestial sphere will look distorted to us. 

The centrifugal force increases with the radius of the orbit for a fixed angular speed. The gravitational pull decreases with the radius of the orbit around Earth. The geostationary orbit is, where the two forces annihilate for the geosynchronous angular speed. The gravitational pull takes the role of the centripetal force to keep the satellite on the circular orbit. That's the principle, which keeps satellites, moons, planets on their respective orbit. If there is some additional force, they leave their former orbit. 

In some sense, the answer is trivially 'yes': Due to spacetime curvature, there exist no circular orbits below $\frac{3}{2}r_s$, with $r_s$ the Schwarzschild radius. So whenever you get an object sufficiently dense, that its radius is below its $\frac{3}{2}r_s$, the mass equivalent to any nonzero rotational energy overcomes the centrifugal force of an orbit at $\frac{3}{2}r_s$. Below $\frac{3}{2}r_s$ even zero rotational energy overcomes the centrifugal force, since the latter is then pointing inward. This doesn't require a Black Hole. 

B and O type stars are rare (0.13% of main sequence stars) and short-lived (less than 100 million years; more accurately less than $10^{10}\cdot 18^{-2.5}$ years, for mass > 18 solar masses). Hence large solid planets of the described type will also be rare, although a priori not impossible. The planet with the highest estimated surface gravity discovered thus far (March 8, 2014) is CoRoT-Exo-3b (add "surface gravity" column to the exoplanets table, and sort by that column): 

The circumstellar habitalbe zone can be defined as the distance range around a star, where the mean temperature of a rotating planet would be between 0 and 100 centigrades, if radiation (heat) received from the star and thermal radiation emitted by the planet form an equilibrium. But that's only a rule of thumb. It has been redefined, and is still disputed. Hence your criticism is justified to some degree. There may exist exceptions of habitable planets outside the presumed habitable zone; and there exist certainy many planets within the habitable zone which aren't habitable. But the probability for a planet similar to Earth to be habitable on its surface is thought to be highest in the habitable zone. When looking for habitable exoplanets, it's therefore more efficient to focus on the habitable zone. 

There are many ways to measure or estimate ages. The age of the earth can be estimated by ratios of certain radionuclides in the oldest rocks. Estimates of the age of the universe are obtained by simulations based on observations (redshift and distance) of distant galaxies, and on observations of the cosmic microwave background. The redshift is used for a velocity estimate; together with a distance estimate (obtained by stars of known brightness) one can calculate back, when all objects of the universe should have been close together. 

The binding energy per nucleon is among the highest for iron-56. Therefore nuclear fusion as well as fission/photodisintegration of iron-56 consumes energy. Heat production is needed to prevent a star from collapsing to a much denser state. Iron-56 provides no way to produce heat by nuclear reactions. Hence core collapse is unavoidable. If the star isn't large enough, nuclear fusion may stop, before the core of the star is fused to iron, since very high temperature (more than 2 billion Kelvin) and pressure are needed to fuse silicon to iron. This way the core may collapse earlier. The collapse releases energy responsible for much of the luminosity of the supernova. Some additional (exothermic) fusion in outer layers of the exploding star may be triggered by the collapse during the explosion. Unlike most supernovae, type Ia supernovae explode by runaway nuclear fusion, not mainly by core collapse. A hypernova may form either due to lack of nuclear fuel, the core of the star first collapsing to a neutron star, followed by a collapse to a black hole, or by pair instability leaving no dense remnant. The cause for the pair instability supernovae isn't lack of nuclear fuel, but the heat of the core. Due to Planck's law the energy of the radiated photons increases with temperature. As soon as they reach the energy needed to form electron-positron pairs, at least 1.02 MeV, heat energy is transformed to mass. This way pressure needed to keep the core stable, gets lost. Pair-instability supernovae and -hypernovae are indicated by high amounts of released nickel-56, which will decay to iron-56. 

BSC5p may be a nice database to start with. The parallax (check according box) and vmag will provide a basis for the calculation of the absolute visual magnitude. The absolute visual magnitude may be lower (star may be absolutely brighter), if the extinction isn't negligible. 1/parallax is a good estimate for the distance. Take this distance as an approximate for the luminosity distance, if you can assume negligible extinction. Now calculate the visual magnitude of the star at 10 parsec distance to get the absolute visual magnitude. Example: Alp1Cen (HR 5459) has vmag -0.01, and parallax 0.751 arc seconds. Therefore the distance is about 1/0.751 = 1.33 parsec. We get absolute visual magnitude $$ M=m-5\cdot (\mbox{log}_{10}D_L - 1)=-0.01-5\cdot (\mbox{log}_{10}1.33 - 1)=4.37.$$ An overview of absolute magnitude and spectral types. More detailed discussion, and tables can be found in this paper. More tables. This book seems to contain a table with values as of 2009, which is cited here. 

If the 3D data cube is sufficiently highly resolved, try to find Doppler shifts in the spectra by looking for typical absorption/emission lines. Doppler shifts correspond to radial velocities. Calculate the mean radial velocity, and e.g. the standard deviation of the radial velocities, as velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersion of galaxies leads to a widening of spectral lines in comparison to a reference star. A couple of methods are discussed in this paper, mostly some kind of Fourier fitting, but direct fitting is used, too. Redshifts may contain a gravitational component. There exist data reduction software tools. A paper describing data reduction and velocity analysis using the XOASIS tool. 

No, the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating. Hence distant objects get more and more red-shifted. Our horizon is shrinking instead of expanding. At the end, only galaxies which are sufficiently bound by gravity remain visible; this could turn out to be the Virgo supercluster. More reading about the accelerating universe on Wikipedia, and on National Geographic. Scientific background to the according Nobel Prize in physics 2011. 

The farther away, the faster the galaxies move away from us. But that's only the overall expansion of the universe. Locally velocities can differ and are to be added to the overall expansion. The Andromeda Galaxy is close enough to Milky Way to be able overcome the overall expansion of space. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way attract each other by gravity. Hubble's law applied to Andromeda Galaxy/Milky Way returns an expansion of space of less than 70 km/s, since Hubble's constant is about 70 km/s/Mpc, and the distance is about 2.5 million light-years, less than 1 Mpc (= 3.26 light-years, see Parsec). That speed is slower than the about -300 km/s helio-radial velocity (space expansion already subtracted) of the Andromeda galaxy, hence feasible to overcome. 

In early times of galaxy formation you would have seen a sky similar to this Hubble Extreme Deep Field image. A sky filled with small, irregularly shaped, young galaxies and galaxy predecessor fragments (sub-galaxies). Galaxies probably formed bottom-up from smaller fragments. Further back in time it would have been dark. Hydrogen clouds would begin to contract, as predecessors of first stars (population III) and clusters of stars. Even further in the past (redshift between 300 and 400) the sky would have been glowing red by what we now call cosmic microwave background. 

We are now about 27,000 lightyears away from the galactic center, close to the perigalacticon. The difference between apogalacticon and perigalacticon is a little more than 4,000 lightyears (15% of 27,000 lightyears). The 15% number is calculated from the 7% eccentricity of the orbit by $1.07/0.93=1.15~~$ according to the definition of eccentricity, and Kepler's 1st law. 

The point you appear to refer to, is called the Lagrangian point $L_1$. This point is a saddle in the field of gravity, hence not to be considered to be stable in the strict sense. Two other Lagrangian points, called $L_4$ and $L_5$, can be stable, provided the considered orbiting objects are of small mass in comparison to the two main bodies of the system, and if the masses of the binary components are sufficiently different. According to theorem 4.1 of this paper, $L_4$ and $L_5$ are stable in all directions, if and only if the mass ratio of the two main binary components $\frac{m_1}{m_2}\geq\frac{25+3\sqrt{69}}{2}\approx 24.9599$. According to theorem 3.1 of the same paper all Lagrangian points are stable in z-direction, which is the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system.

A singularity in the strict sense is not assumed in the beginning of the big bang, but instead a Planck epoch governed by a yet to confirm quantum gravity. General relativity and quantum theory, are not consistent in this phase. This means, that space and time, if they existed at all in some sense, didn't follow the laws of physics we inferred from experiments. This epoch is thought to have been followed by a grand unification epoch, where gravity is already separated from a unified strong, weak and electromagnetic interaction. Then inflation is thought to have followed, "driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density". That's when spacetime expansion is thought to have accelerated rapidly, weak and electromagnetic interaction still unified. All this is thought to have happened within the first $10^{-32}$ seconds. Most of the physics in those early phases is not (yet) accessible to experiments. A few cosmic ray experiments may try to look into the energy ranges, thought to have been present in the early epochs of the universe. More on the chronology of the universe.
