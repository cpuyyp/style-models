If $k=\mathbb{C}$, $X$ is a projective (or even proper) scheme over $k$ and $F$ a coherent sheaf on $X$, then there is an isomorphism $$ H^p(X,F)\rightarrow H^p(X^{an}, F^{an}) $$ (and there is also a relative version of this, for proper morphisms between $k$-schemes locally of finite type). If take $k$ to be $\mathbb{R}$, there still is an analytification functor, so I wonder wether this result still holds and if you could provide a reference for this. Remarks: (i) I must admit that I haven't studied the details of the proof in the complex setting (yet), so from my current knowledge it would be possible that it carries over without major modifications. If this is not the case, what goes wrong? (ii) In case there are additional assumptions to be made, I would also be happy with a statement for smooth varieties. 

For a complex manifold $X$ there is the Hodge filtration on cohomology, induced by the filtration on the complex of holomorphic forms given by: $$ F^r\Omega_X^p:=\begin{cases}\{0\}\qquad\text{if }r>p\\\Omega^p_X\qquad \text{if } r\leq p. \end{cases} $$ If $X$ is compact Kähler, Hodge Theory tells us that this filtration induces a pure Hodge structure of weight $k$ on the $k$-th cohomology group. This implies, a posteriori, that morphisms respecting the hodge filtration, as given for example by the morphism $f^*$ induced on cohomology by a holomorphic map f, automatically respect it strictly, i.e. $F^r\cap im f^*=f^*F^r$. This strictness is no longer given if we look at arbitrary maps between filtered vector spaces. My question is if strictness still holds for morphisms induced by geometric maps if we drop the Kähler condition (and/or compactness). If not can you provide a counterexample? Is there a more general condition on the manifolds/maps that ensures strictness of induced maps? 

Theorem 5.1 in Eric van Douwen's paper "The integers and topology" (Handbook of Set-theoretic Topology) is an old reference for a positive answer to your question and will provide a fuller explanation of the proof mentioned by Guest1245. There are newer references too: see the relevant chapter in L. Halbeisen, Combinatorial Set Theory. With a gentle introduction to forcing. 

The answer is negative apparently. It is consistent relative to ZFC that all Aronszajn trees are special and that the club principle holds: $URL$ 

The following theorem of Kurepa, proved in his thesis of 1935, seems to address your question. Theorem Suppose that $\kappa = cf(\kappa) > \gamma$, and $(T, <_{T})$ is a $\kappa$-tree each of whose levels has cardinality less than $\gamma$. Then $(T, <_{T})$ has a cofinal branch. The proof uses the Pressing Down Lemma (Fodor's theorem) and the Pigeonhole Principle with the bound $\gamma$ to find the branch. A good reference on the general area is A. Kanamori, The Higher Infinite, which contains the proof of the above theorem. You might also wish to consult J. Cummings, M. Foreman, The tree property, Advances in Mathematics, 131, 1998, 1-32. 

TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is weakly compact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the tree property; (iii) $\kappa \rightarrow (\kappa)^{2}_{2}$. TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is strongly compact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the strong tree property. TFAE: (i) $\kappa$ is supercompact; (ii) $\kappa$ has the super tree property. 

Now for the definitions of the relevant tree properties, taken from Laura Fontanella, The strong tree property at successors of singular cardinals, JSL 79 (2014), 193-207. Suppose $\kappa \geq \aleph_2, \lambda \geq \kappa, \lambda \in Ord$. A $(\kappa, \lambda)$-tree is a set $F$ with the properties: (1) for every $f \in F, f:X \rightarrow 2$, for some $X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa}$; (2) for all $f \in F$, if $X \subseteq dom(f)$, then $f \vert X \in F$; (3) $Lev_X(F) = \lbrace f \in F : dom(f) = X \rbrace \neq \emptyset$ for all $X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa}$; (4) $\vert Lev_X(F) \vert < \kappa$ for all $X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa}$. Note $(\kappa, \lambda)$-trees are not actually trees, despite the terminology: for $f \in Lev_X(F), \lbrace f \vert Y : Y \subseteq X \rbrace$ is not well-ordered in general. A cofinal branch is a function $b:\lambda \rightarrow 2$ such that $b \vert X \in Lev_X(F)$ for all $X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa}$. An $F$-level sequence is a function $D: [\lambda]^{<\kappa} \rightarrow F$ such that $D(X) \in Lev_X(F)$ for every $X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa}$. An ineffable branch for an $F$-level sequence $D$ is a cofinal branch $b$ such that $\lbrace X \in [\lambda]^{<\kappa} : b \vert X = D(X) \rbrace$ is stationary. The cardinal $\kappa$ has the strong tree property if every $(\kappa, \lambda)$-tree has a cofinal branch for every ordinal $\lambda \geq \kappa$. A cardinal $\kappa$ has the super tree property if for every ordinal $\lambda \geq \kappa$, every $F$-level sequence $D$ in every $(\kappa, \lambda)$-tree has an ineffable branch. The case of $\aleph_2$ is of interest, much as the classical $\aleph_2$-tree property has been a catalyst of much research and the invention of new forcing (Mitchell); similarly, tree properties at successors of singular cardinals present challenges taken up by many mathematical logicians (Neeman, Unger, Fontanella, Weiss, Cummings, Foreman, Sinapova, Magidor, Shelah, and others). It is conjectured (by Fontanella) that the successor of a singular limit of supercompact cardinals has the super tree property. In the paper quoted above, she proved that if $\kappa$ is a singular limit of strongly compact cardinals, then $\kappa^+$ has the strong tree property. 

Reading the comments, I just realized that part of your question asks about what sets of intermediate cardinality would look like. As Richard and John Goodrick pointed out, there are straightforward definitions of ordinals of intermediate cardinality. But I assume the question is more about whether there are any sets of real numbers with intermediate cardinality, and what such sets of reals would look like. It's not too hard to use the ordinals to cook up some sets of real numbers. (For instance, there's probably a definable way to represent each countable ordinal by a real number, and then the set of representations will itself be of intermediate cardinality.) But as far as I know, no one has come up with any direct characterization of a set of real numbers that could have intermediate cardinality. There are a lot of negative results though. The first is the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, which states that no closed set can have intermediate cardinality. (The theorem shows that every closed set is either countable or has a $URL$ subset. Since perfect sets have cardinality of the continuum this means they can't be intermediate.) In fact, some difficult work of Martin and others in the '70s showed (using just ZF) that Borel determinacy is true, which among other things entails that every Borel set is either countable or has a perfect subset. If we further assume projective determinacy (which set theorists tend to believe) then the same is true for projective sets. Thus, any set of intermediate cardinality has to be pretty weird. It can't be closed, it can't even be Borel, and (if set theorists are right about projective determinacy) it can't even be projective. Thus, it must be pretty crazy, just as we know about non-measurable sets. (Though there's no guarantee that intermediate cardinality goes along with non-measurability - Martin's Axiom guarantees that in fact every set of intermediate cardinality is measurable and has measure 0.)
