Upon study of G.W.F. Hegel's two volume work Lectures on Fine Art he presents a schema of the arts based on the external and internal relations of the Idea in its dialectic mode of expression. Of course, art is to be transcended by religion and eventually philosophy according to Hegel's philosophy of history. Art manifest truth moving in a process of exterior intuition to its internalization. I was struck by the concise neatness that this generated in ranking the arts according to the proportion of experience they serve in the development of human experience. Hegel would have had little sympathy for the avant garde of today much like he shared a disdain for the Romanticism in his own time. Hegel claims that the lowest form of Art is architecture as the purest material form of the Idea, which transforms to the second level--sculptor, the material becoming life-like, and third is painting where the truth is conceptualized onto the canvas. From Painting we move into the rhythms and harmonies of music or the unfolding of truth according duration and time. Through sound we move to the pinnacle of the arts which is poetry (tragedy, comedy, and drama); speech and conceptualization bring to fruition the "concrete, actuality" of the Idea as embodied in the individual characters. Thus, Hegel schematizes and ranks the arts from architecture, sculptor, painting, music, and poetry. If we disregard Hegel's triadic grand narrative of the history of Spirit (Idea), which this formulation aims to support, and his thesis about "the end of art" (that eventually works to the end of history!), does this way of categorizing the types and genres of art still matter? Or should we abandon any efforts to systematize the aesthetic in this fashion because it does not reasonate with a post-Warholian artworld? 

We don't know, but it is also not important to know. What if the hypothesis is true? Will you change the way you are thinking or acting? If it will not change the way you are thinking or acting, avoid answering it from philosophical point of view. You have so many other valuable questions to answer. 

The principle of Maths is to use them in order to solve logical problems. In another universe, if you have one apple and I give you another one apple, how many apples will you have? If you will have 3 apples, then 1+1 will be 3, because the people in that universe have been developed an arythmetic system which correspond to their realities and needs. 

In the binary system, we have 2 digits only: 0 and 1, where 1+1=10. In the decimal system, the one that we mostly use, we have 10 digits (0-9), and 1+1 is always 2. We all made an agreement about a set of rules. Based on these rules, 1+1=2 for the decimal system. A sceptical person may have in mind to change these rules. There is nothing wrong about this. That person is just creating a new arithmetic system, and believe me, it's not as easy task. To conclude, based on the known decimal system and its rules, 1+1 is always 2. The logic behind the result is the set of rules followed by the specific arithmetic system. 

I think Derrida means more than just actuality when he refers to "presence." Presence in the sense of formal essence stipulates a functionality as placeholder but only in the generic sense of being indexical, or pointing to. This is presence in the more localized sense, what Deleuze associates with territorial reason. If we take logos in the sense of Heidegger's "gathering" as the intersection of sending and receiving, the mobility of presence goes beyond the purely formal sense. This is the kind of semantic structure that speaks to the hermeneutics of any possible readers and writers and shows the radical way in which presence is de-centered and, therefore, not logocentric--oddly enough. 

Kant deals with these kinds of social relations primarily in the Critique of Judgment. If you look at sections 39 and 40 entitled "Of the Communicability of a Sensation," for example, you will see there he introduces the notion of the sensus communis, which is the basis of universal communicability. The is the relational power which makes all human cultural communication and interpretation possible. This grounds the community of persons, according to Kant, and serves as a required condition for the kingdom of ends imperative. I interpret this to mean that we feel each other through an equal or mutual relatedness prior to establishing rational or cognitive connectedness (i.e. social contracts). It is also how we feel, Kant states at the end of section 83, a "hidden aptitude within us for higher purposes." He then picks this theme up and develops it in the sections 82 and 83 on the methodology of teleological judgments when he discusses the difference between "technique and skill" and "culture. The latter is concerned with the culture of our moral powers to facilitate social communication, for the sake fulfilling our ultimate purposes beyond the order of nature. For us to establish a "collective self" we need to cultivate the self-discipline and skill to develop both are inclinations and interpretations, which are vital to the maintenance and growth of cultures. Kant refers to this as the cosmopolitan whole that gives humans a "predisposition for community." Community means a community of nations or states, for Kant, in the sense of international relations. A political and cultural order that mirrors the natural order. It is only when all the nations and peoples of the earth put their talents and skills together that culture may thrive! I suggest the following passage as a beginning point for what you may find interesting in Kant's lively thoughts on this very interesting topic that you raise: 

Yes, of course you can make the argument. It doesn't mean that it will be sound or definitive in it's assertions, but any point can be argued. The argument itself is highly subjective - we cannot assert the validity of either side of the debate because there is no authoritative resource which to test the assertion against. One could just as easily argue that they volunteer at a homeless shelter to the benefit of their own ego or public image as could be asserted that their contributions are committed solely to the benefit of others. No opinion can be well-maintained regarding the "degree" of selflessness an ("other regarding") action is motivated by without investing faith into a philosophical model regarding humanity. You must ask: is a person's "selfish/selflessness" defined by the average degree of "selflessness" of their actions or is the quality entirely an attribute of their personality or "self"? How does one judge the degree of "selflessness" of an action - is it defined by the actor's motives, or the action's utilitarian consequences? Then there arises the question of whether or not and arbitrary rating of "selflessness" has any definitive value: if one donates a large sum of money to a sound humanitarian organization that uses it to feed hundreds of starving children, and did so simply for a tax write-off and a boost of public image - does it really matter whether or not why they donated the money? 

Measurement, in the broad sense, involves useful abstractions and logical applicability that allow us to survey environmental data with extreme precision and prediction. The tools or instruments used to conduct such systematic procedures describes and projects a commensurable universe of discourse (UD). But there are “boundaries” to the scope of any UD’s validity—if we know how to include someone or something, we also know how to exclude that person or thing. In fact, as Scott Pratt argues in chapter one of Logic—Inquiry, Argument, and Order if a logical system is not aware of its limits and the incommensurable classes within the UD, it is bound to be used in the service of cultural domination. Logics work largely with an abstracted whole, as a simplification of the real. As Susanne Langer writes in An Introduction to Symbolic Logic, “Abstraction is the consideration of logical form apart from content. The reason why people distrust abstractions is simple that they do not know how to make and use them correctly, so that abstract thought leads them into error and bewilderment. Abstraction is perhaps the most powerful instrument in human understanding (Dover, 1967, 42-43).” Therefore, logical systems may be self-sufficient and complete without ever getting at the whole of all experience—a UD is posited just as much as it is depended upon as the objectified standard. To the degree we are able to analogize without consideration for differences in “content,” we often ignore those disanalogies that act as introspective reminders of the need for logical revision and entanglement. Given the problems of abstraction, division, incommensurability, and boundaries any logical UD encounters, are we to reject any logical system's UD as merely a subset of a wider UD--to see logic not as operative within any monosphere but as polyspheric? And can we conclude further that, necessarily, every logic therefore has the potential for violent and dehumanizing measurement? 

Subjective I'm prone to think the motives are inconsequential - the starving children certainly don't care why they received sustenance so much as they care about receiving it. I would argue that regardless of the donator's motives, their actions ultimately produced a measure of "good" in servicing the individual humanities of others; I might so far as to argue that this common interpretation of "good" is the very reason the donator's actions may be viewed upon fondly by others. Perhaps they did so with "selfish" interests, but here the quality of their motives has no meaningful value. Furthermore I think the nature of humanity and morality in general exists almost exclusively in "grey area" - things are very rarely black or white. Given our limited understanding of the mind, it seems reasonable to me that every action is motivated by hundreds of factors, both conscious and sub-conscious. I feel it is thus likely that all (non-effectively-self-regarding) actions exhibit and are driven by both selfless as well as selfish motives. 

No, you can't make a sound argument that you or anyone else is either "selfish" or "selfless". Everyone exhibits both qualities simultaneously. I can only discuss and interpret the qualities with respect to individual aspects of their actions - and perhaps patterns that emerge over the course of many actions. But I can neither assert that I comprehend all of their motivations nor can I assign arbitrary value to the "degree of selflessness", and so it seems unreasonable to ever hope to objectively classify a person, pattern, or singular action as either or. 

Is it possible to maintain this "between" in the age of egotechnic frenzy and techno-gnosticism or would it be simply naive to believe you can achieve a desirable outside from technological encroachment? When we see images on a screen with more life and vigor than those gawking at them, will we be forever sedated? 

Possibilities are pure nothings. Whitehead discusses the logic of possibilities or "eternal objects" (as he calls them) in Process and Reality and his many other works. Possibilities, in themselves, do exist but only as wholly non-actual--we abstract from the actual world in order to inquiry into boundless possibility. There are nothing without the realization of actualization. Before there can be the actual you, there has to be the possibility of you which is indistinguishable from nothing. Temporally speaking, past possibilities pertain to "might-have-beens" whereas future ones involve "might-bes." The possible qua possible makes room for infinitely many modes of formal relatedness. How or for what purposes possibilities are selected is a separate issue from their existence as pure nothings. None of this is meant to suggest that the actual is superior to the possible or vice versa, as to posit some ontological necessity. Whitehead insists they are co-equal and seeks to avoid the bifurcation of nature. 

The suggested solution is very similar to Whitehead's argument presented in Part I of Process and Reality and presupposed in the Theory of Extension in Part IV. If you recall from Aims of Education he holds that a line is a "moving point" while a "plane is a moving line." Along with von Neumann's work on mathematical rings, Whitehead relies on a continuous, point-free projective geometry of non-finite dimension. Whitehead's "extensa" or extensive structures are logically and metaphysically prior to time and space as topological relational systems (mathematically speaking, they may be seen as spatial, but this pertains to "spatial reasoning"). This allows for the openness in which "universal relativity" (not to be confused with Einstein's as only a single application) and "atomicity" are compatible. He writes: 

You said "With these two comments in mind, could we infer that Socrates fears Euthyphro?" By just taking two comments from such a large conversation, you are going to conclude somethings which may be true (based on just these 2 comments) but pointless/worthless. By the way, I have the conversation in ancient Greeks language ($URL$ and your posted translated dialogue has a different meaning (compared to the actual conversation)! Please note that the "revered friend" is just a common greek expression. It has no particular meaning in the sentence. 

It is a set of interesting questions. We all know that nobody can give the right answer to these questions. For this reason, we can only BELIEVE in God. In order to give any answer about God, we make a number of assumptions and we use mostly our imagination (instead of logic) to approach an answer (The logic can take us from A to B. In order to go further in order to approach Z, we need to travel by using our imagination). It is an illusion to believe that we can find the answer to your questions. And of course, before answering any question about God, we should begin by answering the most obvious question: What is God? 

Instead to use the word "perfect", you should use the word "optimized". I will support that, by nature, the entities which have life, is optimized in many levels in order to achieve survivability. In flora and fauna (actually, the structure of the DNA in every live being) are surviving the strongest, the most flexible, compatible etc entities, and the next generation is optimized based on the current environment. So, the DNA (remember, i refer to the live beings) is getting modifying from generation to generation in order to correspond to the current needs.
