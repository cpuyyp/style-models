Comparing the two bikes side by side there would be more examples where the specification levels are different and would justify additional costs (brakes, wheels, tyres, bars, saddle etc.). 

There are devices that allow a bicycle to be modified to make it easier and safer to ride with one arm. Riding safely would come with practice and confidence. Trikes or recumbents mentioned in the comments offer a safe alternative also. The key modification needed for a bike is a steering damper. The damper adds resistance to steering by way of a spring and helps slow down movement. It relieves the twitchiness of one armed steering. Steering dampers vary from a rudimentary spring based system such as the Hebie 695 a more sophisticated elastomer spring like the Hebie 696 or the hydraulic Hopey system. Other modifications include mounting both brake levers on one side to allow single hand usage and using 1x gearing with a single shifter. (or in the case below a 3x9 in an over/under shifter configuration) 

The single most important thing to know about cycling in London is never ride on the left side of a turning large vehicle, especially an articulated lorry or bendy bus. Many of the cycling fatalities in London are cyclists who ride up the outside of a large vehicle trying to negotiate a corner. Really an important rule for cycling anywhere. 

I found a dent on my rear wheel on the weekend, a UST rim which I had been running a UST tyre on. This was allowing the tyre to burp (not running sealant) so I had to repair or replace. It was the first dent on this wheel and only relatively small (size of nail on small finger) Using the technique of holding a flat piece of metal aginst the rim and carefully working along with a adjustable spanner I managed to get the rim straight without any further damage and could not see any cracks. The bead seems to have maintained it's shape. I refitted the tyre (finally perfected the technique of seating a UST tyre with a floor pump) and it held pressure overnight although I've yet to ride on it. Are there any possible issues that I should be wary before riding this wheel? Should I be confident that there is unlikely to be a catastrophic failue? I'm not concerned about burping, I can manage that just worried of a rim breaking at speed downhill. 

If its mostly flat consider using a technique such as alex has suggested in his answer to cover pinch climbs and small hills. If your doing a lot of climbing (sitting on the front of your seat is uncomfortable and more suited to mtb) the second thing is to change the set up of your bike to fit you better. One of the biggest misconceptions made by bike stores when they set a bike up for people seems to be that they believe the rider is going to spend their life riding around parking lots. Thankfully this isn't true, but it does mean that many people have their bike fitted for flat land rather than climbing. 

Moving to Presta valves. Move to Presta valve tube and use a rim hole adapter such as a Wheels Mfg Presta Stem Saver. 

A coil fork uses a mechanical spring in place of an air spring. A coil spring is simply that, a big metal spring. The benefits of the two types are often debated. A dual chamber air spring fork is lighter than a coil spring but requires more tuning. A coil fork has a finite stroke length so the rebound is smoother at the end of the stroke and makes the fork feel more plush throughout the stroke. It would be redundant to have both a air spring and coil spring in a fork, as both are springs and neither are dampers. The fork would bounce back and oscillate (bounce up and down like a spring until all energy was released). There have however been bikes with two stage suspension systems like the Elite9 which used dual rear shocks and could effectively line up a coil and air spring shock. 

There are things you can try at home but I would recommend talking to a professional to get their expert advice on the correct fit for your style and terrain. You can: 

By shorter stem do you mean reach (distance from steerer to bar) or clamp height? (the length of the clamp on the stem). I assume you are meaning reach, but if you are talking about clamp height then you would have to make up any difference in spacers but the answer below still stands. You should not have to move your star nut or use a larger bolt, if you need to you are likely to end up with something unsafe. There should only be a small gap of no more than about 3mm between the top of your stem and the top of your steerer. If you have spacers between your stem and headset you can remove or swap these for a smaller size to make the stem fit. The star-nut/ top cup and bolt acts only to provide preload-tension so that you can clamp the stem onto the steerer without movement in the headset. Once the stem is on you could technically remove the top cap (but no one does this). If you are having to change these then it is likely that the stem won't have adequate space to clamp onto the steerer safely. Spacers are there to provide leverage for the top cap to add tension but the stem can sit directly on top of the headset if required as long as you have that small gap. Other things to be wary of when changing stem: 

Is there any loss of braking power associated with the noise? Does it feel that the brakes aren't working fast enough? Brakes do make a similar sound when water gets on the rotor for no loss of power. From what you are describing and because you have realigned the caliper I would suggest your pads may have become contaminated or glazed and therefore not engaging properly. Check the pads for chips, hard spots or a glassy appearance (there may be a toe formed at the leading edge of the brake which is ok). Sand the top layer of the brake pad off until it is rough and dull again. Also check the rotor for any greasiness (make sure your hands are clean and dry). Wipe the rotor with isopropyl alcohol or other non-residue type solvent to remove any decontamination. Hopefully this will remove any scraping sound and take you back to the turkey gobble and squealing normally associated with Avid Elixirs. 

A easier way may be to look up your bike year and model on bikepedia, the site is both detailed and accurate. 

Although I have read Sheldon Brown's All About Bicycle Chainline article I'm still struggling to understand a key point. If you are running a different chainline to the manufacturers (new crankset) can this be adjusted for in spacing of the rear axle? Essentially the question is, does the frame drive the chainline or the components and set up? 

The front derailleur you are describing is called an E-Type front derailleur. This means that you have to be careful when selecting a bottom bracket to ensure that you get one that is compatible or you need to alter your chainline. In addition to a bottom bracket having: 

One proven way to retain the "new" feeling of a bike is to keep adding new parts to it. It's a well known (I would say proven but can't find the article) fact that people experience a noticeable performance boost when riding a new bike or upgrading gear. This expectation of better performance actually does lead to a small performance increase. The same thing happens when upgrading a bike, you think these wheels will make me faster and lo and behold you rode a little quicker that day. There are cheaper and more mundane things you can do to retain a bikes newness feeling such as clean and maintain that other posters have suggested. But the bottom line is each time you ride a bike things stretch and wear. Little things such as listed below Will help to maintain the new-ness feel of a bike.: 

Shimano - Shimano has a number of different levels. BB51 deore level, BB70 SLX/XT and BB93 XTR Other similar brands - Raceface X-type is compatible Premium brands - Hope, Chris King and others Hacks - replacing and upgrading the bearings while retaining the Shimano cups. 

Measure against a broken or existing spoke and because this is cycling there is a special tool for it - the spoke ruler! Most LBS have them for correctly measuring spokes. If you are measuring with a standard ruler measure from the center of the J bend to the end of the spoke. 

I think the simple answer is decide what you want a bike for, sell the one you have and buy one that suits. If you want a full suspension bike to ride on the road I suggest you look at a low travel 29" full suspension XC mountain bike as a starting point. 

An unaligned caliper (the unit that sits over the disc) is far more likely than a bent rotor. It's more exposed and susceptible to being knocked. You should first try to realign your disc brake caliper as this will quickly show if it is a rotor straightness or caliper alignment issue. This is a simple job and will only require the correct sized hex wrench. 

Upgrades wide to handle more off road riding I'd look at disc brakes and 32mm + cross tyres. Play with pressure until your happy. 

The front mech may have been misaligned and you've applied weight at a moment when it's not fully shifted. Your weight has bent the chain ring. I have bent a SR Suntour chainring in a similar manner. Halfords have grounds to say it's a user vs a product issue and may not replace it. Depends on the store and the sales person on the day or how hard you're willing to fight it really. However, reading reviews on the 2015 Voodoo Bizango, it appears to be a decently spec'd bike on a really good frame. The SR Suntour crankset looks to be a weakness so you should consider upgrading to a better crankset. Even if Halfords replace it it'll still be a weak point on the bike. You can generally get well priced shimano deore level cranks or similar SRAM crankset which would be a good replacement while not over spec'd for the bike. 

If you believe you have diagnosed the problem then a clean and a service should be all that is required. You don't have to remove the FD. WD-40 will not displace mud effectively. I would: 

Whilst where you stop is important I think it is equally or more important to be aware of other cyclists (primarily in front and beside you) and not cut them off if you pass them. When you take off give any other cyclists plenty of room before you pull into single file. Cutting people off is probably the worst offence, especially as the first person at the lights will likely have the preferential line. 

I would have thought with a few rachet packing straps you could place the bikes upside down on the roof, secure the handle bars to the frame (so they won't turn) then secure the bikes through the rear door or window (front window as a last resort). As a disclaimer I have never seen this done but secured right it should work just like a roof rack and not damage the paint (but hey I reckon the rental company wouldn't check the roof). If the car has basic roof racks you could rig something pretty good up. 

This is determined by your LBS, the relationship you have with them and the bike your buying. Generally bikes come in flat pack boxes and, with the exception of top end bikes, are partially assembled out of the factory. The reseller needs to attach the handle bar and do a safety check. If you want to change parts out you'll have to pay workshop rates. However if you a buying a good bike from a good LBS you'll find they'll disassemble the bike, chase and face the head tube, bottom bracket and disc tabs as part of the sale. They'll also make any upgrades that you've asked for, either purchased from them or from a different reseller. If you're purchasing the parts from them on a new bike you should expect a discounted workshop rate. If your bring the parts you shop be expecting to pay premium workshop rates. There's no set rule of thumb. However as always ensure you have a good relationship with your LBS and they'll look after you and your bike. 

There are a number of simple things you can do to try improve performance before replacing the brake pads. 

Deciding if a fork will fit is a bit easier, is the steerer the correct length (it can be longer, you can use spacers above or below the stem for fit) and is it compatible? You can get headsets that interface some head tubes to steerer they are tapered steerer in 1.5 head tube or 1 1/8 steerer in tapered head tube. Firstly identify what headset you need first and work from there. Cane Creeks headset finder is a good start. 

I think 30 hours is probably conservative, it's too often and won't add much additional value. That would be about right for an air sprung fork with an oil damper, possibly even a coil with an oil damper, both in dusty conditions. Fork service interval for each fork is dependent on the fork, the type of riding you're doing and cleaning you do after each ride. Servicing is done to ensure optimal performance, prevent accelerated wear and prevent failure. Generally servicing of forks includes a replacement of oil and seals, a thorough clean (to remove grit) and a lubrication. Suntour coil forks use a sealed unit for damping and the coil spring. This means there is actually very little servicing the can and should be done. Apart from the dust seals I don't think there are any seals inside the fork to replace, so pulling it apart would only be to clean out any grit that had got past the dust wipers/seals. Servicing would be pretty simple once the fork was apart clean the dust seals, degrease anything that had dirt contamination, re-grease and check the elastomers to make sure they aren't deteriorating. In terms of removing the fork, if you have a repair stand you could remove the brake caliper and drop the lowers off. I imagine you have the XCR RLO and the remote is why you need to remove the grips, apart from lock on grips or split clamps there's no easy way sorry. I've always found grips give out pretty quick anyway and start sliding around so now stick only to lock ins. 

There are two parts to a fork, the spring and the damper. Solo air, dual air and coil are all types of spring and absorb energy when the fork is compressed. The damper, which is the part of the suspension system that removes oscillation after the spring has absorbed energy and is returning, is generally a hydraulic system filled with oil. The Lyric has an oil damper as well as a coil or air spring. A modern air spring generally has two chambers one positive and negative, the positive provides resistance against compression and the negative resistance against rebound as the spring returns to it's normal length. Solo and Dual air are RockShox terms for their proprietary air spring system and relates to the way the shock is filled, but both are dual chamber. Until Solo air forks became available (2012 or 2013 forks) it was necessary to tune both chambers to get sag and rebound correct, now solo air is a single fill system that does this much more easily. Dual air (as opposed to dual position air) has now been replaced completely by solo air on the RockShox range.
