I love to cite reams of scientific journals and studies to support this but unfortunately most of what I know about effective training comes through the certifications I received, working with successful trainers, and years of training clients myself. What I found in that experience is that beginners benefit the most from full body workout routines. There is a learning period when you first begin weight training and your body is primed to respond by building muscle mass - a lot of phenomenal gains you see comes from people training the first time, and it seems that full body workouts using compound movements (bench, squat, dead-lift, etc.) can provide the best base for this. As your experience grows, you'll find you can start to break out and working on muscle groups and eventually very experienced trainers (5 - 10 years) find that focusing on specific muscles and even breaking it down by segment (i.e. arms one session, back one session, shoulder one session) provides value. The most successful long term trainers I know phase their training to accommodate all of these models using periodicity - so they'll have a phase of strength that focuses on full-body and compound movements, and another phase they'll call "sculpting" but is really just a focus on specific body parts and perhaps more isolation movements. 

Your selection of exercises looks good. I would further categorize them like this: Deadlifts (2 work sets of 4 reps) - hamstring-centric Press (3 work sets of 5) - upper vertical push Ring Dips (3 work sets of 9) - upper horizontal push 1-Legged Squats (3 work sets of 7) - quad-centric Pull Ups/Chin Ups (3 work sets of 8-10) - upper vertical pull Inverted Rows (3 work sets of 8-10) - upper horizontal pull Dumbbell Bench Press (3 work sets of 6-8) - upper horizontal push So looking at that, first glance shows a classic error in prioritizing push over pull. I'd balance out your pushing with pulling. Perhaps eliminate the extra horizontal push, or add another horizontal pull to counterbalance it. There are plenty ways to split it, but typically you'll want to have sufficient time between workouts. A few common splits are legs (quad/hamstring), push, and pull. You could also do legs, horizontal push/pull, vertical push/pull. If you only have two workouts, do something like dead-lift and upper pull, then squat and upper push. You noted this is strength/hypertrophy training, however those are two different goals. You can gain strength without necessarily gaining muscle mass simply by improving your neurological efficiency. In fact, the most common response to training is strength which is why building muscle is so hard. Strength training will typically focus on generating as much force as possible, so either heavy reps (high mass, slower acceleration), or moderate reps with higher acceleration (i.e. speed). If hypertrophy is your goal, then increasing load and changing exercises should be your focus. You might consider something like Hypertrophy-Specific Training (HST) and consider swapping out your exercises for new ones every few sessions. The two guidelines I typically use for changing exercises is either plateau (i.e. the first time you can no longer add weight and hit your rep target, then it's time to change the training) or frequency (i.e. every 3rd or 4th workout - 3 is good number because the first workout you learn the exercise, the 2nd you are comfortable with it and the 3rd you can then push past the previous load before moving onto something new). The frequency during the week looks fine. I would never train with weights more than two or three consecutive days without having a day with either full rest or a different activity like cardio. I know some people like to train daily with splits but every workout taxes the central nervous system and it needs to rest and recharge as well. Best of success with your training! 

In cardiovascular training I haven't heard of an observed effect with overtraining relating to lung capacity or endurance. What seems to correlate more highly there is risk of injury: those who overtrain cardio increase their risk of becoming injured (and then they don't get to train at all). It seems the correlation is directly related to the level of impact/intensity. In other words, it's far easier to overtrain doing sprints and intervals than it is to walk long distances. While not scientifically supported I'm sure anecdotally this is why some people do fine going on mega-events like running a marathon every week or running a mile every day, I'm not so sure it would be as positive a result if someone targetted runnin 10 100m sprints every day. 

I've analyzed pictures of famous bodybuilders who claim to "sculpt" but I can guarantee you cannot show me two pictures side by side of any bodybuilder who changed the shape of their muscle. In every case, you might see that muscle become larger, or you might see the definition of the muscle more clearly because they are low body fat. So the keys you have for defining your physique are nutrition and training to focus on fat burning and hypertrophy, but as far as having the larger, flatter vs. rounder muscles, that's given to you at birth.

Increase the overall size of the muscle, and Improve the definition by reducing the covering subcutaneous fat 

The emphasis on grains comes from the fact that the food pyramid is produced by the USDA and grain is a major crop that the organization is behind. You'll also find the major U.S. subsidies (dairy, corn, soy) will play highly in the "recommendations" that come from the organization. You will not be missing out on major nutrients if you choose to take grains out of the base of your pyramid. An easy way to see this is to look at the number of people who suffer from Celiac disease and cannot process gluten, which is present in most grains. They are able to live an alternate lifestyle not based on the prevalence of grains and do just fine. As for fruits and vegetables, you need both. Every fruit and vegetable has a different composition of thousands of different organic chemicals that contribute to optimal health. Certain fruits are rich in anti-oxidants that aren't as abundant in vegetables, and vegetables have bioflavanoids that aren't found in the same ratios in fruits, etc. So you'll want to eat a variety of both fruits and vegetables. 

The answer is, "Yes." You should use all of the above. The biggest mistake people make when training is assuming one technique is better than another. In reality, it's typically the combination of different techniques that yields the best results. For example, my experience as a fitness trainer was that someone who rotated between dumbbell, barbell, and smith machine would have far more success increasing strength and building muscle than someone who simply focused on one. Each has trade-offs. A beginner or someone training without a spotter may want to use the Smith machine. It is the most stable solution and many models are self-spotting. The trade-off is that it locks you into an unnatural range of motion. The barbell is a free weight but as a bilateral movement requires less stabilization than the dumbbells. You can typically load a heavier weight and experiment with various grips. The exercise will focus on the core movement of pressing the weight, unlike the dumbbells that require far more stabilization and coordination/balance. The dumbbells work well and will involve different muscles. You are likely to engage your core more to maintain balance and stability and typically involve more shoulder as well. No matter what you do, I HIGHLY recommend hiring a trainer even if just for a single session to train proper form. You can read and watch all of the videos you like, but there is no substitute for someone there who can evaluate your level of fitness and watch your form and provide feedback. I strongly urge this because if you guess and try to do your best there is a chance you could be doing it wrong and creating a bad habit that can set you up for injury later. As for the technique, it is important to learn proper benching technique including how to engage your scapulae because failure to stabilize correctly can lead to rotator cuff injury. 

The answer is that yes, you can gain muscle without gaining significant strength. While there is some correlation due to leverage, size is a physiological phenomenon whereas strength is more neurological and depends on the efficiency with which your nervous system coordinates the firing of motor units. The keys to growing muscle regardless of what your strength might be are: Mechanical load - you must increase load from workout to workout, on average, to achieve hypertrophy Chronic progression - you should consistently apply a similar load and not change too frequently or your body will be forced to deal with mechanical and neurological adaptation rather than physiological Strategic deconditioning - per Bryan Haycock "At this point, it is necessary to either increase the load (Progressive load), or decrease the degree of conditioning to the load (Strategic Deconditioning). The muscle is sensitive not only to the absolute load, but also to the change in load (up or down). Therefore, you can get a hypertrophic effect from increasing the load from a previous load, even if the absolute load is not maximum, assuming conditioning (resistance to exercise induced micro-damage) is not to extensive. There is a limit to the number of increments you can add to increase the load. You simply reach your maximum voluntary strength eventually. This is why Strategic Deconditioning is required for continued growth once growth has stopped (all things remaining equal)." To summarize, you don't want to change workouts too frequently but eventually you'll have to, and load is king so a training methodology where you can consistently increase load is going to work the best. That means perhaps starting at higher reps, lighter load and progressing to fewer reps, heavy load and then starting over again in what is known as "stair stepping" or "pyramid", i.e. for bench I do 200, 220, 240, 260, then fall back and do 205, 225, 245, 265, etc. to progress. I know some people want the science so if you really do go out and read the journals, here's a boat load of references Bryan Haycock gave me in an interview many years ago (he developed Hypertrophy Specific Training/HST which is a method based specifically on the science behind hypertrophy or muscle building) 1: Nosaka K, Newton M.

Unfortunately while there are reams of bodybuilding books by "experts" telling you how to sculpt your body, there is very little scientific evidence to suggest you can do more than: 

There are both physiological and neurological reasons to build in rest. Even elite athletes who take on volumes of training most of us would not be able to comprehend have smart periods of lighter training and even full rest periods. Physiologically training works by stressing the body just enough that the adaptation allows you to recover and the body overshoots a bit so you end up stronger/more coordinated than before. Doing this too much, however, will back fire due to a principle known as GAS (General Adaptation Syndrome). You can read about it here: $URL$ Basically it ultimately leads to exhaustion and dramatically increases risk of injury. In training steadily (3 - 5 days per week) for the past 10 years I've had no serious injuries because I build in rest. On the flipside I know people who refuse to stop, believing "more is better" and go non stop ... until an injury has them on their back for months. Much better to build in the rest periods when you can control them than to end up being forced to rest because you didn't allow your body the recovery it needs. You'll often hear you are less likely to need rest if you alternate muscle groups. After all, if I work my legs, my arms are resting, right? This isn't entirely true for two reasons. Reason one: unless you're using totally isolated movements like single arm dumbbells, machines, etc, your other muscles do participate to an extent. Your core is always stabilizing your torso, your leg muscles work to provide stability while your upper body is moving, etc. Reason two, and more important: every workout taxes your neuromuscular system. There is a neurological effect. This is where the idea of "muscle memory" comes from and the reason why some people can be extremely strong without having large muscles - it's because their neurological system reacts to the workout by improving coordination of motor units, the bundles of nerves that fire to contract muscle (when you lift a heavy weight or a small one, motor units are helping you do that and it's just a question of how many are activated at once). Any type of training will tax your central nervous system and too much training can lead to fatigue. This fatigue can tax your adrenal system and raise cortisol levels, a stress hormone that also makes it more difficult to burn fat. Literally you'll stress your body to the point your metabolism slows, you burn fat less efficiently and stop making strength gains. So yes, please build in rest. If you train 5 - 6 days per week then a week of light activity is probably fine, but even elite athletes I know try to take at least a week off of ALL training at least once per year. I've found if I train just 3 - 4 days per week then I can go a lot longer without having to take a longer period for rest. 

The measurements are a loaded question and it has to do as much with psychology as anything else. I encourage people to weigh daily but react weekly. This is because your weight can fluctuate dramatically from day to day due to shifts in water balance and not necessarily due to gaining fat or losing muscle. Gaining muscle is an extremely slow process so when you read someone gained 5 pounds in a week, more likely they are retaining water which is not fat. Anything that is not fat is referred to as "lean mass" so they increased their lean mass. It is often assumed lean mass is muscle ... not true. Lean mass is "everything but the fat." The reason I'm fine with people weighing daily is so they can see and understand these fluctuations. That way they start to learn how a meal with more salt than they are used to will result in several pounds gained while a day with fewer carbohydrates can result in rapid weight loss but only because of water flushed out of the system. They'll see that weight can fluctuate up and down several pounds and stop worrying about "Oh my gosh did I derail." It only takes a little math and common sense to realize a lot of fluctations simply can't be fat or muscle. I've dropped 5 pounds on a 10K run. That would be 3500 calories x 5 = 17,500 calories if it were fat, which clearly isn't possible on a 6 mile run. It's water. On the same token, coming in after a weekend of eating and gaining 5 pounds probably isn't all due to fat, unless you managed to somehow overeat 17,500 calories as well. So you really won't see the average trend unless you look at week after week, but knowing daily is good to see how your body fluctuates. For body fat, I suggest going even longer - 2 to 4 weeks. Unfortunately, while people love to proclaim they are "6.5%" body fat the truth is even the most skilled instructors do not assess fat that accurately. The so-called "precision" devices such as hand-held or scales that use electricity are actually even more prone to error due to shift in electrolyte and water balance (trust me, as a trainer for years I've watched people in all different shapes and levels of fitness use these devices). You'll often see someone post "I dropped 2% body fat this week" but the truth is that is going to incude a lot of rounding error. The same person might "gain" 1% the next week and suddenly fret their diet/exercise is off when it's just more rounding error. Instead, I'd shoot for looking at body fat as a trend every 2 - 4 weeks which is long enough to have a substantial difference that won't be as subject to error. I'd also highly, highly recommend having a certified/trained instructor measure using calipers. It's far more accurate to look at "20mm of a pinch of skin" and measure the subcutaneous fat consistently than it is to rely on an electric current passed through your body, especially as you become more fit and lean.
