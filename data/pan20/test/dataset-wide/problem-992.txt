Then to query for all points within a specified distance you can do a query similar to the following 

The first query determines distances between points. It will only return a distance between the 3rd and 4th point as they are the only ones with the same SRID. The other distances will be NULL. The second query is for selecting geometries inside a buffer. Only a single row is returned since the query buffer was created with SRID 2. 

This query should do what you want and avoid any issues with 1 to many relationships messing up the SUMs 

Here's a variation on how I have tackled this in the past. I have added a grp and seq columns to the @Geo to demonstrate how to build multiple lines and get the order of the points in the line correct. The seq could alternatively be datetime. 

The spatial index, as with other objects, have their own menus and need to be done separately. This can be done to the clipboard and pasted to the query window generated by the command. I can't confirm at the moment, but I suspect that the primary key and other constraints come out in the options since the are an integral part of the table definition, whereas indexes are not. The wizard can also be used, but it is a lot of steps if you are just doing a few items. Technet, How to: Generate a Script 

PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension would appear to have everything you need to manage this data. PostGIS has a fairly rich set of functions that deal with rasters like the files that you have described. Further documentation on enabling and using rasters is here. Once you have the rasters loaded a query like the following should perform reasonably well 

The master database is run in Simple Recovery model and hence cannot be restored to a certain point-in-time if the database becomes corrupt. 

db_owner Role The db_owner role can be assigned to individual database users. These can be Windows Accounts or SQL Server Logins. 

Test systems The test system will be backed up during production hours. This can be 10:00 in the morning or at 14:00 in the afternoon for full and xx:15 for the Transaction Log backups. Why I do it this way ...or my thoughts behind these decisions ... By distributing the backup times to different slots, I am evenly distributing the disk I/O on the storage systems. No lumping of massive I/O on the disk at the full hours (FULL) or quarterly hours (TLOG). I differentiate between SAP and non-SAP because of the sizes of the databases. Test systems are allowed to thrash the storage during the day. No high performance impacts. The DIFF and FULL backups occur before the tape backups start and are normally finished before the tape backups start. The retention policies allow me to reach the RTO and RPO laid out by the business even if the (tape) backup solution is down for a day. Backups will still work and be compliant with RTO and RPO even if the network (as a whole or only partially) is down for a day. Your thought process Your setting was probably based on a wrong understanding of Ola's script. 

Analysis You receive the above error message if the program is already running or if your privileges are not correct. Solution Try stopping the SQL Server () service first and the you should be able to start without any further issues. IF the service is not running, check the Processes tab in the Windows Task Manager for a process . IF the the service is not running and no other process can be seen in the Task Manager ensure you start the Command Prompt with and you should be able to start the process. IF you are still unable to start the instance, then you might have to add additional parameters when manually starting your instance. SQL Server Startup Parameters (2014) The parameters for manually starting SQL Server are as follows: 

I've done this using a CTE query as I find it easier to follow and explain. The first CTE is just your data. The second CTE ranks each row of the data using based on the ordering of the . I have include the in the order so that if there are duplicate the first occurrence will be picked. In the final query we are using statements to pivot the data and aggregating the result for each with to create a single row for each . This query can be run over multiple 's 

Also note SQL Server let me build a spatial index over the geometry column that contains mixed SRIDs, but it is of limited use. Even if there was a lot more data, the index would be of limited use. I would suggest to make life easier that you pick a single projection to use across all you data and transform geometries to that. This can be done alongside the current geometries or replace them. Also if you choose a Lat/Lon projection, use the Geography data type. There is an open source project, SQL Server Spatial Tools, that has some tools that will allow you to do projections. You will however have to know the parameters for the projections you are using as it does not appear to have a list of projections to work with. I can't advise how good these are, as I haven't used them. 

This gives a table of 1,000,000 random points with a 2 x 2 degree spread. After trying a few different options on it, the best performance I could get was forcing it to use the spatial index. There was a couple of ways to achieve this. Dropping the index on LegendTypeID or using a hint.You will need to decide which is best for your situation. Personally I don't like using index hints and would drop the other index if it is not required for other queries. The queries stacked up against each other 

How can I force clients to use SSL (to make eavesdropping harder)? The following should fail to connect: 

Can I copy the PostgreSQL data directory on a macOS (10.12.3) machine to a Fedora (25) machine then expect PostgreSQL to work on the destination? I specifically want to avoid / because index creation would take forever on the (much slower) destination disk. PostgreSQL versions are identical on both (9.6.2). Both are 64 bit Intel machines. The macOS machine is running PostgreSQL from Homebrew. The Fedora machine is running PostgreSQL from the official repo Related question: is there somewhere in the official PostgreSQL docs that gives an answer? I searched a bit and couldn't find it. 

I'm running a PostgreSQL 9.4.x instance on Amazon RDS. I can successfully connect to that server using SSL using a command line similar to this one: 

Suppose there is a PostgreSQL server running and it has SSL enabled. Using "standard" Linux and PostgreSQL tools, how can I examine its SSL certificate? I'm hoping for output similar to what you would get from running . And I'm hoping for a one- or two-liner command line answer so I don't have to resort to running a packet sniffer. I do not have access to the PostgreSQL server, so I cannot look at its configuration files directly. I do not have a superuser login, so I can't get the value of the setting and then on it. Using doesn't work because PostgreSQL doesn't seem to want to do the SSL handshake right away. From a quick look at the documentation, I could not find a command-line parameter that makes it show that information on startup. (Though it does show me certain cipher information.) 

If there is a default MySQL user named then you would start a MySQL prompt with the following command: 

3. Verify the setting SQL Script Verify that your instance is running in SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode by issuing the following command: 

I then queried the TEST database with the Windows login DOMAIN\USER. Because the DOMAIN\USER is also memmber of DOMAIN\GROUP the user is allowed to SELECT from all tables in the TEST database. You are writing that the DOMAIN\USER is unable to select any data. Correct? Do you have any orphaned users on the database level? Follow these steps to check. 

If you are on the SQL Server where the database resides, then you can follow these steps to connect to a database in PowerShell First you have to load the SQL Server PowerShell Module. This is achieved with the following simple command: 

Solution: Check SSD S.M.A.R.T. parameters for errors and/or replace SSD. Reference: How to See If Your Hard Drive Is Dying with S.M.A.R.T. (How-To Geek Site) 

Alternate Answer This is a further indication that you might be having IO issues. These issues result in "blocked processes" but without a related foreign SPID. Extended Events might not report the process/SPID in a separate node. 

If you have a file size limitation on the SMTP (Mail) server ..., ask the mail administrator (postmaster) to increase the limit for file attachments to allow your SQL Server Account (or other affected account) to send attachments with a larger file size. 

It's not highly recommended and is best tested in a non-productive environment first. Currently there are no documented cases of the collation being changed during the setup of a service pack on SQL Server. If you don't find any information in the setup logs, then I would try and contact Microsoft and open a case/ticket.
