The problem I then found was that many of the online articles talking of this subject link back to things like this article, which dates back to Midwifery Today Issue 51, Autumn 1999.. Several of these pages link to studies which don't quite appear to say what is implied by the link. For example. looking through the articles referenced in the midwifery today piece a quote says 

The key finding from this and most other well-run studies I could find was that the heating produced at common diagnostic levels does not heat the tissue appreciably, or create cavitation. Some wider studies have shown that with frequent Doppler Ultrasound, there may be a smaller foetal-growth and other issues. But a thing to bear in mind is that generally Doppler ultrasound use is minimised for this very reason (as it utilises a much more powerful beam). Evidence of Problems in pregnancy/childbirth due to Ultrasound Of course a good skeptic looks for evidence for the phenomena being claimed, so I took a look around for evidence of the 

The short English version in Chosun Ibo appears to come from a korean story which can be found here (6th May 2012), I guess - as it has the same image. I would love someone who reads Korean to come and translate this article. Google translate shows a bit more info. on the number reported in AFP (29 attempts where 11,430 tablets smuggled in hand luggage, and 6 attempts where 6021 tablets smuggled in the mail). But it really doesn't illuminate whether the dead babies part is speculation or coming direct from the customs service. Finally, on early news sources there's [this story] 6th May 2012. 5 

I found similar things in each of the other studies I looked at linked by that article. The claims made, did not quite tally with what was shown in the abstract for the paper - so the things Beverley Lawrence Beech was talking about are either viewed as not important enough to put in abstract (unlikely), or the highlights she has are not statistically significant. Conclusion Research is always being conducted in this area, and I think you would struggle to find a clinician who would say Ultrasound is definitely and unequivocally safe. However, I struggle to find well run and clear studies showing an increase in miscarriage or post-natal development, as a result of Ultrasound. Referring back to the Health Protection Agency (2010) document I started with, which makes no secret that further long term research is desirable. 

As purely circumstantial evidence, and knowing these pills are intended as medicine, we can look at Chinese traditional medicine and see what the most traditional medicines are, we can see that placenta, Urine, menstrual blood, bone, even Penis's have been commonely used in the past, but experts say there is no history of usage of Foetus's, and I would tend to believe them. In conclusion I think we can say that "as yet" no evidence is available of such a widespread practice, and Kane Gao's explanation that this is most likely Placenta pills seems very plausible. Sorry this isn't a definite answer, but I thought it was best to put the best knowledge i could find up, so people would see a likely answer first. 

Even if the above authors were not the creators of the myth, there is still reason to believe that, as @Chad puts it (comments above), this claim is an "extrapolation of predicted results combined with humanized responses." Here is a quote from an "anthropology professor who's worked with hundreds of monkeys over the last 30 years." When asked what he thought of the experiment, he responded succinctly with: 

The earliest mention I could find of this experiment was in the popular business/self-help book, Competing for the future by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad (1996). Here is the quote from the book: 

The authors did not provide a source for this claim. This story was later repeated in various other popular business/self-help books. Every source online I could find erroneously attributed the experiment to one of the above authors. No one, anywhere, seems to have a reference to the actual experiment. 

There is a board game from the 90's called 'Mind Trap' in which players must solve tough riddles. One of the riddles goes like this: 

Someone here asked the same question, and the consensus seemed to be that birds don't land on the wires because "a bird's sense of direction is governed by magnetic fields." However, note that they also concluded that the birds wouldn't be shocked by the wires because they're not grounded, which I'm fairly certain is incorrect. 

One popular explanation is that near-death experiences are due to Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic drug produced natually, in small amounts, in the brain. It is speculated that large amounts of DMT are released during near-death experiences, though I don't know of any studies that confirm this. 

I've heard this rumor a few times (example). The argument is that it takes energy to make the car, and when you take into account how long each car will last on the road, driving Prius's over a large number of miles will end up requiring more energy than if you had driven Hummers over that many miles. This argument sounds dubious to me. Is there any validity to this claim? 

As @William Beaty guessed, it's basically just a big capacitor to correct the power-factor; since you are not billed on your power-factor, this will save you absolutely no money. Here is a site which explains and debunks these power-factor scams. 

C. K. Prahalad is deceased, but Gary Hamel is still alive. I tried contacting him several times, but unfortunately both he and his secretary were very evasive. The best I could get was 

Well since the graph is disconnected (that is, there are tribes of people who still have had no contact with the outside world), this statement can't be true, since there is no way to reach them from any of us. 

That sounds like hogwash to me. However, over the past few years I've noticed I have never once seen a bird sitting on a high-voltage power-line. So, are birds really magnetically repelled by high-voltage power lines? 

Given that there seems to be no evidence anywhere of this experiment ever actually taking place, that all trails of references eventually lead to the claim in this book, and that this is the earliest available mention of the experiment, until further evidence becomes available the most reasonable conclusion is that C. K. Prahalad or Gary Hamel made up the experiment for their book.
