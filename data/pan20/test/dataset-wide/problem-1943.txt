Yes. Those are exactly the kinds of things that lead to negative reviews. However, it's how you handle it and the progress you make towards correcting them that leads to positive reviews. 

Reading between the lines on that, essentially you can't perform a job that a paid employee should be doing. This is going to greatly limit your ability to "help" out on existing projects - basically you'll watch and see how things work but you won't be able to contribute much to it. Now, back to the question: yes, you can put it on your resume. However before you leave you should discuss what's going on with your manager and make sure your expectations of the job are inline with their's and inline with legal requirements of your area. If those expectations are out of whack then do what you can to leave on good terms with them such that they'll provide a positive reference. 

The right answer for the future is to delete unsolicited CVs sent by a recruiter. That way you don't even have the appearance of impropriety. In the current case, if you decided you liked the information provided and even went so far as to track the candidate down, then you should stop right now and formalize an agreement with the recruiter. Is this backwards? Yes. The key here is that the recruiter is in the business of providing information. You implicitly agreed to using their information by deciding to track that candidate down. To me it doesn't matter what the legal situation is. The moral one is that you used their business for your benefit and should compensate them accordingly. Everything else is just trying to draw some gray lines in the sand. 

While it's true that companies love go-getters, that's not really what you're doing here. The first thing to be aware of is that unless you are talking to someone in your report chain about the job, especially if it is an job you are applying to in a formal method(ie through job listing without a known contact inside the company), then anything you send will be looked at by someone in HR and will not probably get to someone in the chain who would care about the work and effort you put in. That HR person probably can't speak to the quality of your submission to this particular portion of the job. To them you're someone who sent a bunch of 'extra stuff' along with the resume. If you're working with a recruiter, if you know someone in the hiring chain of command then maybe it would be worth it. For something going to an HR front-line worker this is probably going to look weird and probably not in a positive way. You will be the applicant that send a bunch of extra, unasked for stuff. Stuff that's only valuable if you are in the group that requested it. Stuff that only makes sense in that situation. The second thing to consider is... well there's no easy way to put it. Are you sure that you can do this task on your own, without inside information, without guidance or leadership in a way that is positive and professional(and that the company is looking for)? Heck I'm not in a place in my career where I am looking for internships and I certainly wouldn't want my first introduction to a company to be a cold generated review of software without knowing the context and expectations. You mention that they are explicit in the details but, let's be honest here, that means they probably have a very specific business use case in mind. A general comparison on a wide field of softwares(even if it follows the blurb they put in their job advert) is something that could go pretty wrong pretty fast honestly. It could really make you out to be a much worse candidate than you are. If I were in a hiring position and someone in your position did that I would be a bit put off by the candidate. It's hard to put into words why, I think it's something about a internship/entry level candidate that would be so presumptuous as to attempt to make recommendations from outside the company before meeting anyone in the company. Imagine if someone came into your house and by way of introduction said "That's a decent couch but I think a purple couch would be much better. By the way have you tried the cheese at the grocery store. The Swiss is ok but the Colby Jack is full of flavor and robust!" The final thing, in my mind, to consider is that if you're willing to do the work for free why should they hire you? Your time, even when looking for a job, is valuable. Doing free work for a company smacks of desperation and devalues your work. All of this, on reading back, comes across a bit negative. There is a place for what you are talking about. That place is in the interview. Bring up the fact that you saw the specified job duties. Feel out the conversation about those duties and, if appropriate make general, positive recommendations. Random, outsider attempts at job duties don't belong on the application. 

My opinion is that focusing on companies that don't deal with a lot of PII may be your best bet. Specifically ones that don't collect SSN's, bank account info, etc. What I've seen is that companies which deal with info that can easily be used to impersonate others tend to be far less lenient when red marks show up from a background check. However ones that don't deal with that information are less constricted on the backgrounds of the people performing the work. Mainly due to contracts they have with their clients and/or state/federal laws they need to comply with. For example, I wouldn't bother applying to work in a hospital or bank's IT department. However, applying to a company like nVidia might just work out. 

The best way to resolve this problem is to bring it up with management and have them make a decision as to what the temperature controls should be set at. 

Your statement here raises a red flag with me. Help Desk, by its very nature, involves a fair amount of documenting your work. What did you do? Who did you do it for? Is this something that requires a change in operations or is it a one time thing? In other words, by it's nature a help desk job involves quite a bit of bureaucracy. Regarding your other questions: An hour is pretty short for a technical job. Yes, you don't normally have a 1 hour long conversation with someone. UNLESS you are trying to gauge whether this person actually knows what they are talking about AND that you will want to spend an unknown amount of time working with them on a daily basis. I'm going to ask you what you've done before, where you've been, why you left, what your goals are, what you think of linux/microsoft, etc. In other words I'm going to spend the time to get to know you. Think of it as a blind date. You usually can't tell if you want to go out with the person for a second date until you've spent a little bit of time with them. Although, sometimes you just know off the bat and that's when the "interview" is cut short. The types of questions they will ask will be directly related to the type of support you will be performing. So, if you know what it is you will be supporting then you should brush up for that. The test itself will also be directly related to your job. For example, if you are going to be supporting windows desktops then I'd expect them to ask you questions about the start button, moving files around, setting up outlook (if they use that email client), etc. For a job like that I'd likely just put you in front of a PC with a problem, then pretend to be a user as you ask me questions and troubleshoot it. Judging from all of your questions and various statements it sounds like you are brand new to the work force. Step back and take a breath. Done right, the interview process will help you understand a bit more about yourself. To prepare, spend a few minutes figuring out what "tech support" means to them. Then take some time to review the types of issues with items you might be called on to support. Then relax and keep an open mind. 

Expanding on the comment. You are assuming that the hiring manager is who actually going to read your application email, and then read your email body as the cover letter that they requested. But it is not always the case. What if Adam is reading the email and Eve is the hiring manager? Adam will then download/print the attachment(s) and pass them to Eve. Now Eve asked for a cover letter and a resume, but she only has a resume -> She will say it is the applicant's mistake. Provide what they ask for so you don't decrease your chances in getting the interview. And always show that you do exactly what is requested from you. EDIT: After the OP edit, now the above is to a completely different question. In the new case, I would suggest that you use your best judgement, based on the position you are trying to fill: 

While everyone is telling you no and do not do it. I will go with yes and go for it. Only once you get lost you find yourself. I think you don't like what you are doing right now. And that you need a break, for yourself and to find your interests and happiness. It is awesome that you have an idea to work on. Go for it and give it a try! You are in an age that you can still fail miserably but then make up. It is absolutely fine. When I was at your age, I was a Technical Support and hated because felt useless and left, found my self somewhere sometime else as a developer and it was awesome! I have 0 regret to give. Even your username says Tired Dev! Leave mate and once you are ready and you think that you really want it, don't worry, you will find a way. It might not be exactly what you were doing before, but you will find your better way. 

I know this is a rant but a couple things here you should consider. First, salary, like the price of most things, is based on supply and demand. It sounds like your profession is over supplied, at least in that part of the world. Which means you have two options. Either relocate to somewhere else or figure out how to do something else. This has nothing at all to do with politicians, investors or business owners and everything to do with the number of people willing to work the same job you are for those pay rates. Having a master's degree is meaningless if everyone has the same one. There are people in my country with master's degrees working as an assistant at local fast food places simply because those degrees are over supplied. Next, and this will sting a bit, you have what's called a "first world problem". There are a few billion people on this planet who struggle just to get food and water. You are struggling with getting a coffee pot. Get some perspective. Finally, I'm not European so I'm not sure what a "wrong" passport is or what "easily" means with regards to emigration. However it sounds like you need to take a hard look at where you are going and decide if spending the time to fix those two items is worth it. It might be. 

Internships are not limited to students. I changed career from Chef to Software Development. My first job(before I returned to school) was technically an 'intern' position. Intern positions(note I am only really talking about paid internships) typically are the bare-bones, entryiest entry-level jobs in a particular field. There're there so that people who want/need/lack experience in a field can get their feet wet, so to speak, without high expectations of previous knowledge. To this end internships are incredibly useful for almost any student or individual who wants to get real world experience in a field. Why did I type all of that? Because that's how you should be pitching these internships on your own resume. You are an individual who wanted to gain more experience and knowledge in the field of your choice. In order to do so you take courses that interest you as they come up at a local university AND you've taken several internships. You are now confident that you are ready to take the next step in moving up and into that field. BOOM. Pure interview gold, right there. You are viewing your internships and school choices as a huge detriment and something to try and step around. I think you will find yourself to be more successful if you embrace it. 

This tells them that I'm not looking at just one number - and you shouldn't be either. It puts them on the hook to give a complete rundown of what to expect for salary + benefits. About half of the recruiters I've spoken with will immediately spill the beans. The others try to counter by saying it's at a "competitive market rate" - which is meaningless BS. If they go the Market Rate route I'll press them with: 

I think you may have some expectations about your review that are, imho, unlikely to happen. The first review at the 90 day mark is often just a formality. You haven't been fired so you must be doing a good enough job to keep around. As you've stated other execs have complimented you. At this point just settle in and keep doing what you are doing. 

My point in all of the above is that you simply can't compare any amount of equity to monies received as salary. Because equity could end up worth far more, the same or far less than the equivalent salary by the time it all shakes out. The only real way to look at this then is that Equity is "bonus" money. In other words if you get something from it then great; if not, well you weren't living off of it... Which then takes us to how you should be looking at this deal: Are you willing to work for the salary they gave you, with a potential but not guaranteed bonus at a later date? 

This will depend greatly on the company. In some large companies in the tech industry, at least, culture is a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b. It tends to be cultivated and grown, carefully managed and part of the brand identity. But it comes from somewhere and the seeds of a corporate culture often start with the founders and board members. Some companies hire specialists and teams whose entire purpose is in the fostering and maintenance of company culture. A successful culture will start at hiring - hiring surly employees and trying to have a culture of happy, hugs won't work. Having a culture of innovation and hiring individuals based on their willingness to follow rules probably won't work. Additionally, healthy corporate cultures cannot be a ground-level(or 'grunt' level) only attitude. In order for a corporate culture to be successful, self sustaining and healthy it needs to be embodied at all levels. Employees being asked to be part of a open and honest culture, for example, will be unimpressed if their management is duplicitous or shady. 

You're dealing with a couple of complex situations here. Let's break them down and discuss them individually. First - you have a mentor that, for whatever reason, isn't a very good mentor to you. 

BTW, because you are a contractor I'd expect your position to be up in the air. If you provide a core function then the new owners are going to want someone full time. If you don't then the owners are going to make a decision on whether the position you fill is even necessary. So if you want to stay you might consider figuring out which of those positions that are now open you'd like to fill on a full time basis. Then go talk to new management about filling those shoes. 

Others have addressed the relationship issue. Regarding the patent itself - if you are even considering the idea of selling your company or searching for additional investors later on just having a patent will increase the value of your company. If the patent is actually defensible, all the better. I find it absolutely hard to believe that anyone in a mentoring position would tell you not to file. Worst case, you waste a little bit of money and it gets rejected due to prior art. Best case you end up with something of actual value that you can leverage when attempting to set a value on your company. Bear in mind that many companies have been bought out just for the patents they hold. Carson63000 in a comment on another answer brought up that there are people who, due to ideology, think that you should never file a patent. The problem here is that the system is currently based around it. Not filing means you leave yourself open, filing - even while protesting the need to do so - is the only way to go forward for now. I'm certainly one of those that believe software patents should be illegal. However I'm also a realist and in this marketplace filing patents is as much a defensive maneuver as it is an offensive one. If you have the ability then file. While also writing nice letters every so often to you congress telling them how horrible the idea of software patents are. 

So my boss asked me to come to his office to take my opinion about a raise that my colleague asked for earlier. This colleague started only months ago but he proved that he is very good at it. Took big bugs and fixed it then started improving the application and released new features only in couple months. He started with an agreement for a certain salary where a raise is to be considered based on his evaluation during the agreement period. Now that colleagues asked for a raise almost 25% of what he is taking. I didn't know what to say because I didn't know about it so I said that I will think about it and get back to him. What should I say? My boss is the owner and the company is a small company (5-10 employees). I didn't know numbers and we both managed to keep it this way; I only knew percentage. The question sounded very normal, not tricky or trap for over limits/responsibility sort of questions. It sounded like he just wants to know what do I (a good coworker) think so he knows what to do best for the company. I liked that he managed to ask me, I took it as my opinion is important and as he is consulting me. I want to be part of making the decision. I agree that it is not of my business when it comes to salaries, but I think this overall situation is an opportunity to show/improve leadership skills towards a future possible management position.
