I'm not overly happy in my current work environment. The people are good, the hours are perfect, the amount of flexibility I have is nice, but the job itself is pretty terrible. Lack of work at times, not really growing my skills, and there is little to no advancement opportunity. So I have a degree in IT. I want to continue to work in the IT field, but currently there is nothing open in my area that fits my skillset. So I'm looking for a new job but I can't seem to find anything in IT. There are plenty of jobs outside of the IT field that I feel I would be qualified for. My question becomes, is it bad for me to work in a job that is not IT for a time until something in IT opens up? Will it look bad on my resume? Will potential future employers think, because I quit an IT job to work in, let's say Sales or something not IT, that maybe I couldn't handle my previous IT job? 

Short answer: No, don't put this on your resume. Long answer: Just because you were let go during the trial period, due to slower than normal adaptation to the job, doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at what you do. Maybe you just take longer to grasp all the ideals that the company has for their employees. This can lead to you being let go, as you are not "perfect" in their eyes. Now, knowing that yourself, doesn't mean everyone will see it that way when you walk into an interview. Even if you explain what happened, they might just assume you're putting yourself in a positive light instead of telling them what really happened. I would say leave the job off your resume and just go from there. Build your resume up on your strengths and past employment that you performed well in. The people who read your resume will only see that you lasted in your previous job for a month, and they'll wonder why, possibly might kill your chances of getting an interview. Again, don't get down on yourself. Each company has different expectations of their employees, some expect you to be a pro within a week, some expect it's going to take longer to get settled in and they understand things can take time, especially for a new employee. Just keep working hard and keep your resume focused on the good. 

I would definitely talk to the boss about your situation and see what he is thinking. You may have given your boss the impression that you're not to be counted on to work, and they may have the wrong idea. You should ask your boss for a closed door meeting, where you can discuss what happened to you on that first day, and explain why it happened. Let him know that you are able to work, and are willing to do what you need to do to prove to him that you are to be counted on, and you will be at work when they call. He may just have the wrong idea, so the worst thing you can do is just let this go and hope for a good outcome. You need to address this, don't be confrontational, don't storm in and demand to know if you're being fired. Just ask for a meeting, talk to him about your situation, and maybe you'll find out they just didn't need you for those few days. It's always a good idea to just talk it out. Also, as Vers said, you should probably consider also just starting to look for a new job as well, as if being gone a day or 2 gets your boss mad enough to fire you, after all you've done for them in winter times, then maybe it's not a company worth your time to stay with. 

If you've already explained your situation to them, and they still can't or won't be flexible, then you're out of luck. You don't really have any "rights" when it comes to interviewing, they can choose whether or not they want to be flexible, they don't "owe" you anything as you're not employed. So no, you don't have any rights, and it's probably best to just forget this job, or find a way to have someone watch over your Aunt while you interview. 

In my experience, as long as the wages are not insultingly low, what most people want from their employment is job satisfaction. They want a job that is intellectually or emotionally rewarding, one that allows them to do good work in a context where that work will be valued. Money usually becomes a primary motivator only when they are frustrated in those other desires. Certainly, the best colleagues and subordinates I've known have seen their employment in that way. If I found myself in negotiations with an employee who was focussed solely on money, I would worry that either we were failing to use him appropriately (which we could fix by a change of focus or team) or that he wasn't really interested in the work (which we could fix rather less sympathetically). I'm not saying I'd reject the possibility that we weren't paying him what the job was worth - sometimes these things do slip by from lack of attention. But I would be more wary than I would with an employee whose focus was on improving their job satisfaction. There are areas of work where money (and the desire for more of it) is expected to be the primary motivating factor (e.g. high finance). Are you in one of those? If not, do be aware that pure focus on financial reward is a little out of fashion at the moment, largely due to the economic consequences wreaked by those same sectors. Note: in response to the extended question from the OP, I've added some emphasis markup to the above to clarify, without changing any of the content. The original question asked why "I want more money" can have a negative connotation. So my answer seeks to explain the perception. It does not say that anybody should not aspire, nor that they should never ask for more money. 

I do not believe you can go higher up without causing more conflict. You have every right to debate this with your line managers - go argue your case - but unless you can show that they have acted completely unreasonably or that this situation is critical to your team's existence, then you have no grounds for going higher up. There is no way to go above your managers' heads without making it a challenge to their judgement. If there were a way to keep it secret (for example, to arrange for an apparently unrelated external event to require changing things your way), that might work but I wouldn't respect your bosses' managers if they agreed to do that in this context. In this case, it is going to be very clear that any intervention from above was instigated by you. Is it worth it, for this? You will permanently damage your relationship with them. I think your boss has the right to make the decision she did. If she doesn't like working with that organisation, she is in the position to make that call. It doesn't matter that there's a policy saying it's permissible to work with that group. If there were a policy making it mandatory, that would be different. Note: I see from your comments above that you hate confrontation and do not deal with it well. But debate (which will only involve confrontation if it becomes unreasonable) is essential here. If you do not debate it with them, you have absolutely no grounds to go above their heads. If I were their boss and you came to me with your objections, I'd say "So what did they say to your argument? Oh, you didn't present it to them?". Not giving them the chance to examine your reasoning and present their own before taking it upstairs is dishonest and unfair. Ironically, it also guarantees the conflict you say you don't like. You should consider assertiveness training. Assertiveness is all about being prepared to state your case reasonably. Your lack of assertiveness is the problem, here, not your manager's lack of judgement. Until you learn to stand your ground and make your case, your manager will not have the chance to show whether or not she is truly unreasonable. Go back to them and explain why you feel it is important. Ask them to reconsider. If they still say no, say OK but ask for their reasons. If those seem unjustified and this really is so crucial, then take it upstairs. And be prepared for conflict. 

I know a few companies that buy carbon offsets for every mile they make their employees travel. I can't really say if this is feasible for you (I think most options are targeted at really large companies), but if this is about environmental concerns it might be a reasonable compromise. 

Let your HR departement manage that. Unless your former colleague has completely changed the field he will now be working for a competitor and might not even be allowed to help you (and when in doubt HR is better prepared to handel legalities that might have to be dealt with). Even if he wants to help you cannot expect him to work for free. You are probably not authorised to offer him payment, so again, let HR handle this. Or even better, don't do this at all. It is unlikely that after 6 months he remembers enough details to be of much help, and nobody I know of likes to be stalked by their former workplace. 

You should just quit. Probation period works both ways - it is not just the company testing you out, it's also you testing the company, and obviously the company has failed your test. Six months probation period sounds German. So if you wait to long for the company to implement changes probation might end and you will most likely find yourself at the wrong end of the customary German three month notice period. Do you really want to be bogged down for three quarters of a year ? So quit - this is not you being spoilt, this is what a probation period is for. Also that way the company can look for a replacement and does not have invest any more money into an unhappy employee. Plus with markets being as they are at the moment you should be able to find a new job quickly, so there is not point in dithering. It's just when you find that being unhappy in your job becomes a habit that you should reconsider if the problem is with you and not with the companies you work for, but for now looking for a better fitting opportunity seems the thing to do. 

While lack of formal education in the field might not be a deal breaker (e.g. I studied education and I implement Web Analytics Systems for a living) lack of relevant experience probably is. "I believe" is not going to convince anybody. You must be able to make a case that your previous work has prepared you for the challenges of the higher position. I frankly have no idea what being a "fiber optic planner" entails in its job description, but typically higher paying jobs involve skills beyond the technology (being able to talk to and negotiate with clients, managerial skills etc.), so you need to be sure you are in some way prepared for that. Else you'd have to take the long way and somehow aquire the necessary skill set (night school, online studies etc.) and then try again to apply. 

If you divulge information on an ongoing lawsuit your current employer might decide to sue you (e.g. if this leads to loss of business - they might then try to blame bankruptcy at you. That your grievances with your employer are factual does not necessarily help in that case). So you don't bring it up. Either the interviewer does not know about the lawsuit, in which case there is no need to bring it up, or they do know about it, in which case they'll understand why you cannot talk about it (plus they'll probably would not want to hire somebody who is indiscreet and thus a legal risk, so it is in your best interest not to bring it up). 

There may be company cultures where talking about personal issues is looked at as a sign of weakness, and if you work in a place like that you might want to keep quiet. However, based on personal experience, I would say that talking helps. My wife suffered from complications from surgery last year, was in a coma for two months and is now permanently disabled. Caring for her would be a full time job by itself, and I have to do it in addition to my day job. Also of course this affects me psychologically. I have been quite upfront with all of this with both my superiors and colleagues, since this rather affects my performance. And while I still have (obviously) to do the job I was hired for the company has been looking for ways to accommodate my situation, and my colleagues now at least understand why I'm constantly looking tired and show some understanding. Had I kept quiet that would not have happened. So I'd say mention it at least - at the worst nothing will come off it, but maybe somebody is willing and able to assist you with your situation (but remember that other people have a life, also, so don't take it as an excuse to talk constantly about your issue).
