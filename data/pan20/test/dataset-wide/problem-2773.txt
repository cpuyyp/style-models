I will try to reconstruct the argument of both the first and second section in detail, as they differ slightly. I freely admit that the argument in the first section is a bit obscure and seems arbitrary at times, but I think that they are essentially identical and that the argument becoming clearer as the text goes on is kind of implied in the nature of the analytic method he announced for the first two sections. All translations are from Kant, I. (2011). Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals: A German-English Edition, eds. Mary Gregor and Jens Timmermann. Cambridge: CUP. First section First step: Lawfulness of the will The first step is both in the first and the second section to bring lawfulness into play. This is where the arguments differ the most, out of reasons that are not possible to include into this answer, because they are not obvious or trivial (Oh what is in Kant?!). In the first section it is achieved through his definition of duty. Kant argues here in three steps, whereas the second and third are explicit: 

That should (hopefully!) clarify why the objective principle in fact has to be a subjective one when it comes to practical concerns, because there always the representation (object of the will) precedes the object (outcome of the act in nature) within a particular subject. Particular willing is always the willing of a particular subject. TL;DR It is subjective in the sense that it is judged by a particular subject as the principle of this particular subject. This choice does not contain any implications for other subjects, e.g. rational beings as insights. But insights into the nature of subjectivity (of rational beings) very well have implications for particular subjects, independent of their particular 'conditions', and are in this sense objective. 

Therefore they do not have any 'inner good', but are seen as good only because they may correlate with a good will, and usually do. That means the 'good' is only derivative here. 

As you can see this could refer to "pure intuitions" (or intellectual intuition) of things-in-themselves ("of a whole as such"), but is only ascribed to understandings fundamentally different from ours. It would also be coherent to your quote as only archetypal/intuitive understanding would include intuitions of things-as-themselves as it literally produces exactly what it thinks by thinking it (basically Gods understanding), so that it automatically intuits them as a whole. Further evidence This is consistent to all his earlier writings and his opus posthumum: Ak 21:75 (manuscripts opus posthumum, first convolute): 

This is supported by the definition of metaphysical realism, which includes both aspects. That means it is implicated that in order to be a "real" (harhar) realist, you have to endorse both aspects, which corresponds to the fact that Kant called himself transcendental idealist, albeit being an ontological realist (highlighted in the article on idealism, too). The ontological idealist on the other side is an idealist in the strongest sense and has by definition have to be epistemological idealist. And an ontological realist does not have to deny the independent existance of thoughts, that would be materialists. Answer So basically, following these definitions, someone who says that facts exist independent from our thoughts, i.e. we can unalienated by human thought or perception know of them, have to presuppose fact-constituting existance that is mind-independent. Ergo, epistemological realists have to be ontological realists (and only then are full-blooded realists), epistemological idealist can be. 

I read it as follows: a) There may occur ‘controversial social issues’. b) These issues may raise or reveal issues in the social customs/habits, i.e. in ethics. c) When these issues are addressed ‘in a reflective and responsible way’ (probably: abstract/general considerations?), we speak about morals, i.e. a field in that ethics is reflected upon. Now, we can reflect on morals, i.e. our way of reflecting upon social issues, as well: 

Analytic and synthetic judgements His definition is rather straight and it seems as if you correctly applied it: analytic essentially means 'already thought within the concept itself': 

We cannot predict if there will not be a new Einstein that pulls a theory out of his hat that makes it possible to make higher-dimensional energy obtainable (and controllable)....or some other weird stuff exponentiating our possibilities. It is pure speculation, but not nonsense per se. Actually, looking at the history of physics, it is rather likely. 

This would mean that it is reasonable to assume that morals in the contemporary sense of cultural habits of social life were developed by homo habilis as early as around 1.8 million years ago. Steigl also acknowledges that "the first signs" (whatever this may mean) can be "observed among primates". This is a bit fuzzy (see third point) and does not at all mean that primates always showed "first signs", but leads us to the question of the relational connection between primates and Hominidae as an interesting aside. Aside 

That is exactly what you referred to in the OP. Nothing interesting here, as he does not seem to think he had to provide any reasons for that. The questions therefore is totally legit and leaves us with the task to provide an answer. Why heaving mass is adding something to the concept of 'body' It is crucial to understand which concept of 'body' Kant means here. In his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Sciences from 1784 Kant writes: 

Here, the punchline is "a human being is not a thing" as well as not being "at my disposal", but further specifics are not given beyond the "end in itself" idea. It is just clear that one should not see the human body itself and its abilities (e.g. working power etc.) as a mere mechanical factor just like any other physical object (similar to Heidegger's Dasein vs. Sein). So there are only hints so far. 2. One does not have the rights (or "principles") of others at one's disposal 

TL;DR: No, he did not! To be precise, things-in-themselves may be objects of thought, i.e. abstract concepts of the realm of logic, and therefore concepts of transcendental philosophy as logically necessary conditions of the possibility of experience. But they cannot be objects of knowledge, i.e. things that are particular objects of experience subsumed under concepts (i.e. at least the categories). That is why there is a quote in his Opus posthumum that states that the very concept of thing-in-itself is self-contradictory. Arguments Regarding direct quote from the Critique of Judgement Kant used the intuitive understanding as a limiting concept [Grenzbegriff] to understandings like ours and always disjunctive to it, like the holy will vs. a finite (albeit, in abstraction, pure) will like ours in his practical philosophy. From the Critique of Judgement, §77, paragraph no. 8 (Ak. 407.13-408.23, quoting the paragraph as a whole, bolded by me), Cambridge Edition: 

His answer is named "Critique of Pure Reason" and is quite a bold book. It includes all kinds of ontological and epistemological questions, anthropology (implicitely) included, and therefore is in this sense more "general" than a question that merely asks for what is existing (object) or what "I" am (subject). It also includes practical philosophy, as there are perceptions of actions, therefore it would be more adequate to state that all Kant wrote after 1781 (the moment he finished a first sketch of an answer with before mentioned book, as he stated in a letter to Christian Garve from August 7th, 1783, Ak. 10:336-43) is part of the answer to that question. Interesting enough, this question is the starting point of the philosophy of Hegel, Husserl (Phenomenology), the old realism/idealism debate, pragmatism, and the Philosophy of Mind. Another question after Helmuth Plessner, and starting point of Philosophy of Life/Philosophical Anthopology, would be: 

Here, Kant gets more specific in two senses: First, he makes clear that it is about human beings being the (autonomous, but this is at a later stage of the argument) agents of their own principles and rights. And secondly, they must, as rational beings, always be able to see themselves as an (autonomous) agent of these principles and rights, given they knew all relevant circumstances of the situation. In other words: It should be reasonable that if they had the choice and knew the facts, they would be ok with you acting the way you do. The latter formulation may lead to some misconceptions. The asterisk at the end of the paragraph leads to a very important footnote where Kant explicitly distances himself from the well-known Golden Rule ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.", see e.g. the Bible Tobit 4:15, Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31). The point here is that it is not about what you would like to be treated, but the other one, and only insofar they are a rational agent (since you cannot and should not guess what a particular person actually likes or needs to be happy, as most people do not even know it themselves, cf. Ak. 417-8). This solves alleged problems of the principle regarding S/M-people etc. which are prominent in literature as well as certain forms of enjoying prostitution and other problematic cases the Golden Rule is open for. 3. It involves acting for the betterment of all humanity 

The cognition must contain something that is valid only for the object in question and not for other objects, i.e. it must be determined and distinguishable. Step two: A criterion of truth must be valid for all objects of cognition 

In fact here he says that as soon as we try to go further than a priori principles as found in the three critiques, we transcend all knowledge ("es überschreitet die Grenzlinie alles Wissens [borderline of all knowledge]"). The object of speculations like that would become a no-thing [Unding]. That doesn't mean that we couldn't contemplate on them. But all contemplation then would never be in the realm of knowledge, but mere speculation. That is only consequent, because the difference between object [Gegenstand] and thing [Ding] is the one between the table of judgements (necessary conditions of reference to objects as such [Gegenständen überhaupt]) and the table of categories (necessary conditions of reference to things as such [Dingen überhaupt]). The latter only makes sense for intuitions [Anschauung], concepts [Begriffe] and intuitions are interdependent, therefore the proclaimed contradiction in itself (remember the famous quote about concepts and intuitions). As soon as intuitions are involved, we can schematize, and only then knowledge is possible. I actually think this is the real reason for his needing of a type of the moral law in the second critique, because for the moral law itself, we have no scheme and therefore no (not even practical) knowledge. Regarding Fichte, Schelling and Hegel Most contemporary philosophers only learned from CPR through Jacobi's reading of the A edition (which wasn't too accurate) or by the B edition, because there have only been 1000 copies of the A edition and the first edition that featured both has been published in 1838. The readings and (mis-)interpretations of all three critiques by Jacobi, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel are perfectly described in Eckart Förster's The 25 Years of Philosophy. For a detailed answer on their objections and their ways to finally get access to things-in-themselves I would recommend reading the book as a whole. Regarding the actual questions. Death, as your example, is an appearance. It appears to us in a certain way. It has, of course, also an accordance in your noumenal self. But a noumenon is a thing in its essential being, it includes all aspects of its being. That is something that we cannot possibly ever get hold of, therefore Kant clearly rejects the possibility to conceive a noumenon. 

He here refers to his Transcendental Aesthetics, where he showed space and time as forms of intuition. Now, as objects are given through intuition only, they underlie the same forms. In this sense space and time are the conditions of the possibility of our reference to objects insofar they are given by intuition. 

One could, therefore, conclude that while applying the standards of deontological morals it is a completely immoral book, according to certain utilitarian views the means justify the end, just as Machiavelli himself may have seen it (which surely is Viroli's view). All in all, every political actor has to be judged by moral standards and Macciavelli does argue this as well. In this sense, The Prince surely is not immoral. All Macciavelli does is opening the scope from individual actions to "the whole reign will be judged by history", which is actually, as Viroli argues, an enduring picture still influential in modern history, and probably the reason why the book is part of the curriculum of (at least most of the) ivy league colleges educating the soon-to-be powerful. 

That means that if the terms of good and evil are taken morally, they are mere opposites. On 'good' that can be evil Kant has some accounts of "good" that may be used for evil deeds e.g. in the first part of the Groundwork that may be taken as making a venn diagram possible, but this "good", has to be understood in the sense of "good as means", i.e. in an instrumental sense, therefore he has to say: 

Summary The understanding of what it means to be Wissenschaft, i.e. something that through its methods literally translated creates knowledge [Wissen = knowledge; schaffen = to create], had been quite different. Hume's skepticism led to the understanding that all phenomenal, empirical data is not reliable enough to constitute knowledge in this very peculiar sense. And what Hegel thought to have accomplished is to present a method that, through its application, is able to get rid of empirical illusions, leading to an understanding of how reality actually is, i.e. to knowledge. Therefore, in this sense, it is Wissenschaft. And it is Wissenschaft der Logik as the knowledge is gained through a very specific methodology he calls logic, although this may differ a lot from contemporary understandings. Long story short: If terms in historical philosophy do not make any sense, try to look up their historical and, in philosophy, often times technical meaning. 

Bringing the two together A dogmatist, you can be regarding basically every single knowledge claim conceivable. Atheism, in particular, can be dogmatic. But it does not have to be. A lack of faith [faith is a subspecies of belief] in God is a matter of fact, it does not need justification. Faith is strongly linked to religious feelings and we have to distinguish between the claim of someone having faith [=holding a particular belief] and the claim of his faith being an accurate assumption about reality [=having knowledge]. As soon as atheism as a knowledge claim comes into play, matters lie differently: Knowledge needs some justification, all kinds of knowledge do. But atheism as a knowledge claim is but one version of atheism. A dogmatic one, indeed. Just as theism/religion as a knowledge claim instead of (purely) a matter of faith. That is why agnosticism (the view that one cannot have knowledge about something) regarding God potentially can very well both be on theist's and atheist's side, although the former surely is uncommon considering the subjective certainty a conviction of faith carries. As you can see in this answer, even the quite prolific New Atheists (Dawkins in particular) shy away from labelling their view as dogma and consider themselves agnostic instead.
