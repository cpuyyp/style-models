I am by no means an authority on this area but prompted by user /u/called2voyage I will refer the 1994 Astronomical Journal paper by Shahid-Saless (Colorado) and Yeomans (JPL) Relativistic Effects on the Motion of Asteroids and Comets. To paraphrase their abstract: They study the predicted effects arising from relativistic perturbations on the motions of asteroids and comets and show that for a number of such objects, inclusion of relativistic contributions in the equations of motion give rise to significant improvements in the orbital solutions. They go on to argue that ignoring such corrections to the equations of motion gives incorrect solutions. They point out how the use of masses derived from relativistic ephemerides together with purely Newtonian equations of motion results in an inconsistent hybridized non-Newtonian, non-relativistic model. With respect to the posted question:- (a) are the existing observational data on any Asteroids or Comets sufficient (in terms of accuracy and extent of observations) to determine/estimate rates of non-Newtonian perihelion advance? ...the authors short-list 15 asteroids with the largest predicted relativistic perihelion precession rates (from a long-list of 156 commonly-studied objects). For example Icarus has the greatest rate (0.101 arcseconds/year) and had (in 1993) been observed over 43 years thereby producing a predicted cumulative relativistic precession over this period of 4.34 arcseconds. Observations referred to are a mix of optical and radar (no spacecraft telemetry) and are those used to produce the ephemerides model from which orbital elements are extracted. The authors note that, assuming a (then) current observational accuracy of a few tenths of a second of arc, the relativistic contribution to precession should be detectable for Icarus and other asteroids near the top of the (ranked by precession-rate) list. As with the planets the majority of asteroid perihelion precession will be caused by the perturbing influences of other planets, but the authors do not present calculated values for these contributions). (b) are any such determinations publically available? ...the authors selected six asteroids whose motions are significantly affected by general relativistic effects. They then calculated a set of orbital elements for each orbit using JPL's development ephemeris DE200 (with Earth and Moon perturbations treated separately). They did this in two ways, firstly with Newtonian equations of motion alone and secondly with the addition of non-Newtonian General Relativisitic equations of motion. The authors indicate that the residuals (differences between observed and predicted positions at various times) are improved (i.e. reduced) by application of non-Newtonian corrections to the equations of motion. For example the RMS residual for Icarus is improved by 30%. Thus it is technically possible to calculate differences in the orbital behavior (such as perihelion advance) predicted by (i) the pure-Newtonian model and (ii) the Newtonian plus non-Newtonian model. However the paper does not actually present explicit accounts of total observed perihelion precession or a breakdown into Newtonian and non-Newtonian components. In any case, due to complexity, such a breakdown could only apply over the period of observations which is limited (maximum 61 years in 1993) compared to the timescale (a few hundreds of years) over which (predominantly Newtonian) planetary-induced perturbations might be expected to average out. However it would be possible (assuming there are no major perturbing encounters with planets or the asteroid belt) to use the provided asteroid orbital element data in a numerical orbit simulator program to roughly model the perihelion precession rate of an asteroid orbiting the Sun in the presence of the other planets using Newtonian equations of motion (i) without and (ii) with relativistic modifications calculated from $\frac{F}{m} = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left(1+\frac{3V_t^2}{c^2}\right) = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left(1+\frac{3GM.SLR}{c^2.r^2}\right)$ (see Walter-Goldstein-Schwartzchild Formulation ). That way the amount of asteroid precession resulting from each of the two different sources (Newtonian, non-Newtonian) could be modelled. Note: As /u/UhOh/ commented, an alternative, possibly superior, equation for the extra, relativistic acceleration is given in the Shahid-Sales & Yeomans paper cited above as Eqtn 3.11, on page 1886. 

The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours. (Well, actually a little less, by about 17 minutes, but close enough.) That's $360^\circ$ in 24 hours, or about $15^\circ$ per hour. $15^\circ$ is 30 times the width of the Sun or Moon. The Sun moves exactly that fast (on average), the stars a smidgen faster, and the Moon a tad slower. (The Moon lags behind the stars by approximately its own width every hour.) Since Venus is never more than about $45^\circ$ from the Sun, it always sets at most 3 hours after the Sun does, and rises at most 3 hours before. 

We have found instances of asteroids that are mostly rubble piles, but spinning fast enough that they would fly apart if bound only by gravity. The most likely binding force is static charge, although some sort of glue is not out of bounds. I don't know if either of these would be called "hydrostatic", but if the question is really "Is gravity the only force that can bind a non-solid object together?" the answer is no. 

You could also try (what I call) a simple finite-step simulation using Newton's laws to operate on object masses, positions, velocities and accelerations. I'm not sure if this falls within what David calls "geometric integration techniques". My point is that you can do it without incorporating the planetary equations. Disadvantage = the simulator "cuts corners" by using approximations and this leads to behaviours in the model which are artefacts. These disadvantages can be overcome by using other techniques. Advantage = it makes the code design easier, it avoids the suspicion that the planetary equations (and their assumptions) are driving the show. You do not need to be an expert in numerical methods to use the simple Leapfrog Integration technique (described in detail in Feynman Lectures vol I) to model Newtonian Precession in Solar system orbits over periods of up to a few centuries. By running simulations at various time steps (e.g. $dt=1200s, 600s, 300s, 100s$) plotting the results in Excel, fitting a curve and extrapolating to $dt=0$ you can obtain results for long-term average Newtonian precession which are within 1% of the accepted figures. Another advantage over analytical methods which produce long-term average results is that you can examine behaviours at shorter time-scales. For example if you graph perihelion direction vs. time for a certain planet (e.g. Mercury) you can see the $\approx 11.9 $ year periodic fluctuations in precession rate resulting from the movement of Jupiter around the Sun. It is also a lot of fun (and very easy once you have written the basic code) to play "what if?" simulations by varying the number and properties of the bodies in the system and even by adding additional Non-Newtonian forces. To quote Feymnan (op cit) (With a computer) it takes only two minutes to follow Jupiter around the Sun with all the perturbations of all the planets correct to one part in a billion, by this method. But you do have to think carefully about what you can reliably infer from the simulations - for example if your time-step is longer than a few hundred seconds the simulation will indicate precession in the opposite direction to that which really occurs (i.e. retrograde when it should be prograde). 

You know, the first time someone told me this, I was absolutely certain they were confused, ignorant, or otherwise mistaken, and I told him he had his facts wrong. To be precise, we were talking about an observer on the equator. I maintained that the Sun would rise due east and set due west, all year round. He said no. What gave me pause, though, is that this person was far from ignorant, so maybe the other two appellations didn't fit either. I went home and tried to construct a convincing proof of my side, and in the middle of the night a very simple and convincing proof did come to mind. Except that it was a proof that I was wrong. Imagine that you're on equator at sunrise on the summer solstice. Due east is along the equator. But the plane of the equator is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit, and the Sun is well above (north) of it. You cannot see it due east at sunrise. It has to be $23.5^\circ$ north of east. (Remember, this is for an observer on the equator.) By the same token, the Sun must rise $23.5^\circ$ south of east on the winter solstice, and gradually transition between these extremes during the year. 

In a previous question about differences in Newtonian and GTR gravitional force for the case of star-planet gravitational interactions an approximate relationship was noted between the expressions for the gravitational force exerted by a star on an orbiting planet (the solution is valid situations with low gravity, slow orbital speed, and spherical source). This was based on texts in Walter 2008 and Goldstein et al 2001. Walter derived an approximate relationship assuming a circular orbit. Goldstein focussed on deriving an orbit-average expression for perihelion precession. On re-examining these texts it seems to me that GTR (General Theory of Relativity) provides more than just an orbit-averaged approximation. Rather it provides a phase-specific formula for total acceleration (in Scwharzschild space-time). The equation of motion for a Newtonian orbit is $$u''_\theta + u_\theta =\frac{\mu}{h^2}$$ where $u_\theta = 1/r_\theta$ and $u'_\theta =$ d$(u_\theta)/$d$\theta$ and $h$ is specific angular momentum which is constant, $\mu = GM$ the gravitational parameter, $G$ is Newton's Universal gravitational constant, $M$ is mass of the star, $r$ is distance from star to planet, $\theta$ is the True anomaly. Using $h^2 = Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2$ where $Vt$ is the instantaneous transverse component of velocity (in vector terms = full velocity minus radial velocity) we can obtain $$u''_\theta + u_\theta = \frac{1}{Vt_\theta^2} \left( \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \right)$$ where the term in brackets is the Newtonian acceleration. Walter presents the following equation for a GTR orbit (Schwarzschild model) $$u''_\theta + u_\theta =\frac{\mu}{h^2} + \frac{3\mu}{c^2}\,u_\theta^2$$ Now, using $h^2 = Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2$ and $u_\theta^2 = 1/r_\theta^2$ we get $$u''_\theta + u_\theta =\frac{\mu}{Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2} + \frac{3\mu}{c^2 \,r_\theta^2} =\frac{1}{Vt_\theta^2 } \left( \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,+ \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,\frac{3\,Vt_\theta^2}{c^2 } \right)$$ where the terms in brackets are the Newtonian acceleration and the extra acceleration according to GTR. And so the ratio of Newtonian acceleration to GTR-specific acceleration, at any angle $\theta$ is $$1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 Vt_\theta^2}{c^2}$$. Goldstein emphasises that the GR acceleration does not indicate a velocity-dependence, so an alternative, more palatable, distance-dependent form of the ratio of accelerations, at any angle $\theta$, would be:- $$1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 h^2}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2} \equiv 1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2} $$ where $h$ (specific angular momentum) and $P$ (semi-latus rectum) are the values for the orbit of the particular subject planet. And so (ignoring other massive perturbing bodies) the magnitude of the total instantaneous radial force on the planet (of mass $m$) towards the Sun is given by:- $$ \mathrm{F/m} \,= \, \frac {GM}{r_\theta^2} + \frac {3 GM.GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^4} $$ N.B. The GTR/Schwarzschild equations relate to proper time and Schwarzschild radial distance, not their Newtonian equivalents so strictly the ratio of accelerations is still an approximation. Is this analysis valid, or have I missed something? Update I have accepted Stan Liou's answer as being very helpful in (a) providing a derivation from GTR/Schwarzschild of the formulae presented by Walter and Goldstein et al. and (b) indicating the imperfect correspondence between GTR terms/concepts and Newtonian terms/concepts. My understanding is as follows. In a Newtonian central-force elliptical-orbit model the addition of an extra centre-directed acceleration ($dV/dt$), which varies through the orbit as $(+3 V_t^2/c^2\,\equiv \, +3 h^2/r^2c^2)$ times the co-temporal standard Newtonian centre-directed gravitational acceleration, can be shown (by first order perturbation analysis or numerical modelling) to produce apsidal precession at a rate (radians per orbit) defined by a Newtonian formula $$\epsilon = 24 \pi^3 \frac{a^2}{T^2 c^2(1-e^2)}$$ . This formula is well-known (see for example Wikipedia Apsidal precession). According to, but not clearly referenced by, this article, the formula (or an algebraic equivalent using other terms) was well known c. 1895 (i.e. before the publications of Gerber 1898 and Einstein 1915). The formula predicts very well the long-term values of apsidal precession determined using Newtonian models from observations of solar planets. Various writers (Einstein, Goldstein, Walter, presumably many others) present mathematical arguments indicating how an identical formula can be derived from Einstein's GTR. The presented arguments may involve approximations (e.g. Walter's use of near-circular orbits, Goldstein's use of orbit-averaged precession) and non-mathematical "correspondences" between the concepts/terms of the GTR model and the concepts/terms of the Newtonian model. 

If you project the orbits onto a plane, for example the plane of the ecliptic, the projections will cross. But that's only because you're looking at a 3D problem in 2D. If you look at the orbits in 3D, you'll see that Pluto's orbit is highly inclined (17º) from the ecliptic, so it never actually passes through Neptune's orbit. Each time it seems to cross (in the 2D view), it's actually well above or well below Neptune's orbit. Pluto and Neptune never come closer than about 17AU. At least for now. Minor perturbations over tens of millions of years may change that. Or might not. Pluto and Neptune currently have a 3:2 resonance, and such resonances tend to be stable. You might want to look at $URL$ especially the section "Relationship with Neptune". 

The distances to the two main bodies are not only equal, they are equal to the distance between the two main bodies. In other words, the two main bodies and L4 (or L5) form an equilateral triangle. 

An alternative expression for the extra, (supra-Newtonian, relativistic) acceleration (brought to my attention by user /u/uhoh) is presented by Shahid-Saless (Colorado) and Yeomans (JPL) in their 1994 Astronomical Journal paper: Relativistic Effects on the Motion of Asteroids and Comets. Their equation 3.11 for the Newtonian + Relativistic acceleration of a single target body orbiting the Sun is as follows:- $$ \frac{d^2 \textbf{r}}{c^2dt^2} = \frac{-\mu}{r^3}\textbf{r} + \frac{\mu}{r^3} \left[ \left(4\frac{\mu}{r}-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)\textbf{r} + 4 \frac{(\textbf{r}\textbf{.v})\textbf{v}}{c^2}\right] $$ where $\textbf{r}$ is the instantaneous position vector of the target body relative to the Sun, $\textbf{v}$ is the instantaneous velocity vector of the target body relative to the Sun, $c$ is the speed of light, $\mu = GM/c^2$ is the Schwartzschild Gravitational Radius of the Sun, $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, $M$ is the (post-Newtonian) mass of the Sun, $\frac{-\mu}{r^3} $ the first term on the RHS, is the Newtonian radial acceleration with the negative sign indicating acceleration towards the source. The authors present a derivation of the equation (which is beyond my expertise). They also use it to derive an expression for $\delta \omega$ the amount (in radians) of rotation of the line of apsides per complete ($2\pi$ radians) orbital revolution:- $$ \delta\omega = \frac{6\pi\mu}{a(1-e^2)} \equiv \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a(1-e^2)} \equiv \frac{24\pi^3 a^2}{T^2c^2 (1-e^2)} $$ where $a$ is semi-major axis of orbit, $e$ is eccentricity of orbit, and $T$ is the orbit period. The right-most version is identical to the Einstein 1915 equation presented in the question. It is noteworthy that the Shahid-Saless & Yeomans equation 3.11 indicates that when $\textbf{v}$ is not perpendicular to $\textbf{r}$ a part of the non-Newtonian acceleration will be directed in the direction transverse to the radial direction. Note that caveats apply when moving between a General Relativistic model of Space-Time and a Euclidean-Galilean model -see Stan Liou's answer and the Shahid-Saless & Yeomans paper itself. 

Kepler's third law is trivial (in my opinion) compared to his first law. I am quite impressed that he was able to deduce that the orbits were ellipses. To get that, he had to go back and forth plotting Mars' direction from Earth and Earth's direction from Mars. He knew the length of both planets' years, so observations taken one Mars year apart would differ only because Earth had moved. But maybe not so trivial. He published his first two laws in 1609. The third law didn't come along until ten years later, in 1619. With ten years to work on it, even the most obscure relationship will eventually be found. To discover a ratio-of-powers relationship, plot the logarithms of the numbers. In your example with $x^4 = y^3$, the logs would plot on a straight line with a slope of $3/4$. The timing is right. Napier published his book on logarithms in 1614. Kepler may have on a whim applied this shiny new mathematical tool to his crusty old data. The major hurdle was that at the time there were only six known planets, so he didn't have an abundance of data points, and the ones he had were by no means precise. Kepler's other problem is that none of his laws made any sense to him. They fit the data, but he had no idea why. He didn't have Newton's laws of motion to work from, he had no understanding of force, momentum, angular momentum, and certainly not gravity. So far as he knew, the planets moved the way they did because God decreed it, and angels were tasked with pushing the planets along their orbits. The outer planets moved slower because they were being pushed by lesser angels. (Feynman makes the comment that we understand so much more now. We now know that the angels are on the outside pushing in toward the Sun.)
