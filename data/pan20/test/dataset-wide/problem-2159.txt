ALmost certainly not. It is highly unlikely that anyone is going to care whether an application came in at 2am or 2pm. If you are really concerned, most email programs have the ability to schedule an email to be delivered at a later time. That would allow you to write an email at 2am and have it delivered at 8am. 

I have never encountered a situation where a sincere "thank you" was inappropriate. If you're feeling thankful, I'd always recommend saying so. It's almost certainly not necessary in the sense that your boss certainly isn't making a list of the "naughty" employees that didn't say thanks and the "nice" employees that did. You almost certainly won't suffer for failing to send a "thank you" email. On the other hand, social niceties like this almost certainly contribute to the friendly culture that you enjoy. 

There is no best answer. The vast majority of the time, people are really just interested to know if you have any questions. Normally, if the interview is going well, you'll have the opportunity to ask your questions at the appropriate point in the interview. For example, if the interviewer asks about your availability for after hours support, that would probably be an opportune time to ask about how they manage that and how big a commitment that would be. If you get to the end of the interview and you still have questions that you haven't had a chance to ask, either because they didn't come up or you didn't think of them at the time or because you didn't have a chance before the interviewer moved on, that's the time to ask them. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine to say that you don't have any questions. Now if you're going through the entire interview without asking any questions of your own, that would often be concerning since it often implies that you're not particularly engaged or that you don't care much about the position. If you've had a good back-and-forth conversation throughout the rest of the interview, there is no need to force yourself to ask something at the end. 

This is a legal question so you'd really, really want to get the contract reviewed by a lawyer that can advise you about what it means to you in your very specific situation. Undoubtedly, there are ways to protect yourself. Having a non-lawyer read a contract and summarize it for a group of non-lawyers to comment on is likely to introduce all sorts of potentially catastrophic errors and omissions. First off, if you are establishing a legal entity DmitryCorp separate from yourself, you would very likely want to create a limited liability corporation. Broadly, that would shield your personal assets and expose just the assets of the corporation to a suit. If the corporation loses a suit for more than it is worth, DmitryCorp can happily file for bankruptcy while Dmitry the person retains all his assets (and his sterling credit report). Of course, here is where a real lawyer will give you a ton of clarifications about how to establish such an entity, how to ensure that you don't run afoul of various laws, what you have to do to keep your liability limited, etc. Second, DmitryCorp can very likely purchase errors & omissions insurance that would cover your corporation in case of a claim based on buggy code it produced. A number of corporations that hire contractors require that the contracting company maintains this sort of policy in part to prevent contractors from maintaining an asset-less DmitryCorp that can't ever be sued. How expensive that is and exactly what it covers is something that you'd need to work out with your insurance agent and your lawyer. Reviewing the contract with an actual lawyer will tell you whether this company is really putting onerous terms in the contract that you really can't protect yourself against or whether setting up a corporate entity and buying appropriate insurance would realistically protect you. Of course, you'd need to factor in the cost of establishing this protection (including the tax consequences) when deciding how much you'd need to charge the company for your services to make it worth your while. 

"Is this ethical" isn't a question that can realistically be answered. Different people (and thus different companies) will have different opinions. If most people historically end up wanting that week off, closing the entire office and telling everyone to take vacation can be the more ethical approach. If the office is open and people are allowed to work, then you need to ensure that some number of people are around to cover all the job functions that need to be covered. You can't have all your IT folks on vacation, for example, if other people want to be able to work. That may lead to lots of vacation requests being denied (formally or informally because some unlucky person gets told that he has to cover the day after Christmas) and cause lots of unhappy people. If only a handful of people want to work that week, it may be more ethical to tell that handful that they have to take their vacation days rather than forcing lots of people to work when they'd rather be on vacation. Of course, you'd want the company to announce that sort of policy in advance so that people can plan appropriately. If people already had non-Christmas plans for their time off because the change was announced at the last minute, that's obviously unfortunate. But it's also probably understandable if the conversation that lead to the policy change started when line managers started getting vacation requests and started grumbling about needing to ensure minimal staffing levels. 

It depends. Given two otherwise completely identical candidates, one of whom has an online presence (blogs, forums, or something else) and one of whom doesn't, it's pretty reasonable to expect that the candidate with a solid online presence is going to be preferred. If establishing an online presence had no cost, it would be a no brainer. But in reality, you rarely come across completely identical candidates and you always have to consider opportunity cost-- what would you have done with the time you invested building your online presence. If the question is whether it would be better to invest time cultivating an online presence rather than, say, binge watching some brainless reality television, building an online presence is certainly going to be better for your career. But there are many plausible alternate uses for your time that might be better for your career than building an online presence. For example, there may be projects at work you could work on in your "free time" that would be more appealing on your resume-- most companies have a laundry list of projects that they would like to have done but that aren't high enough priority to assign resources to. There may be certifications that you could pursue that would be more valuable than a nice blog. There may be freelance jobs you could pick up or work that you could do for a charitable organization that would better showcase your skills. It's possible that creating a blog is the best possible use of the free time you have outside work to invest in personal improvement. But that's not something anyone other than you could realistically make a guess at. 

Unfortunately, it's probably not a good idea to give feedback. Many of the applicants that will receive your feedback will immediately conclude that it is an invitation to discuss their candidacy rather than the constructive feedback you intended. If you tell them that they don't seem to know X, they'll frequently respond with an explanation of how they've used X or why they really do know it well. They'll send you a shortened resume and ask you to reconsider. Or they'll ask for more help revising their resume or finding good sites to review a particular technology or some other request that will inevitably require more and more of your time and energy. Even if you can guarantee that applicants will be receptive to your criticism and won't treat it as an invitation to do more work, giving constructive criticism is hard. It would take far longer to provide feedback to a candidate than it would generally take to interview them. If you're dealing with a large number of candidates, you could easily end up spending many times the amount of effort providing feedback that you would spend actually interviewing the candidates. It's unlikely that your employer really wants you spending that amount of time giving feedback to candidates that you've rejected. And if you talk with HR at your company, they will probably tell you that it's much safer for the employer if you don't provide feedback. Inevitably, you'll come across candidates that will misinterpret your feedback and try to read in some intent to discriminate. For example, many candidates whose English skills aren't up to the needs of the position will be from some immigrant group. It would be relatively easy for someone that is upset at being rejected to try to read between the lines and interpret a poorly phrased comment about their language skills as really a coded comment that you don't want to hire people of a particular ethnic group. This is particularly likely when you're providing feedback over email where the tone of voice and body language aren't communicated and the recipient can obsess over an awkward phrase and where you're trying to provide feedback to a large number of candidates. 

It sounds like you're being paid pretty fairly. Most businesses will estimate that the fully loaded cost of an employee is going to be in the neighborhood of 150% of that employee's salary. Individual businesses and individual employees, obviously, vary quite a bit but there are a lot of overheads to consider. First, there are taxes. Your employer is paying the 6.2% employer half of your Social Security tax and the 1.45% employer half of your Medicare tax that you'd have to pay if you were self employed. That's 7.65% of your salary. Plus, there are going to be additional taxes for things like unemployment, state taxes, etc. Second, there are benefits. The amount that an employer pays for an employee's health insurance can easily exceed $10,000 a year. You can potentially look to see what sort of rates you'd pay if you bought your own insurance policy on your state's insurance exchange to get an idea of what that adds to your overhead. Then there are things like 401(k) plans and other fringe benefits that employers have to pay to establish and that employers may contribute to. Then, there are vacations and holidays. If you're getting 2 weeks of vacation and another 10 days off for holidays and sick time, that means that you're actually billing 48 of 52 weeks in the year. That adds ~7.7% to the employer's fully loaded cost. And that goes up if you spend a week or two a year on the bench in an average year or if you're getting more holidays. Next, there are all the administrative things the company does. The company deals with going out and finding clients so you're minimizing the time you spend on the bench and the hours you have to invest in marketing. The company probably pays someone to do some amount of "relationship management" with clients that isn't billable to the client but helps ensure work for others. The company deals with preparing and sending invoices and following up with the company when they don't get paid on time. They pay your salary on time rather than when the particular invoice got paid. They deal with the risk of clawbacks if a client goes bankrupt. Finally, there are issues of scale. Companies that want to contract out work find it much easier to deal with a single invoice from a single company rather than separate invoices from individual freelance developers. Companies find it much easier to deal with a single company that they can ask for more developers from or ask for people with different skill sets rather than going out and recruiting individual freelance developers themselves. Consulting companies charge more for these conveniences which also adds to the bill rate you see. That "scale premium" isn't really overhead, but it is something that you'd need to factor in if you were trying to compare what you could make as a freelance developer rather than as an employee of the contracting company to see what a "fair" wage would be. 

Can you? Sure. Should you? Probably not. Doing one day of volunteering is unlikely to be impressive enough to bother devoting space to. It's not enough time to really demonstrate or develop skills and it's not enough time to demonstrate commitment to a particular cause. It's lovely when people want to volunteer but if you're going to put it on a resume, it should really be a much more substantial commitment. If you list a single day activity, you're likely telling whoever is reading your resume that your experience and skills are so minimal that a few hours of work is one of your biggest selling points. Realistically, you likely want to highlight whatever it is that lead to your professor asking to volunteer in the first place. I'm not sure how to get from "exceptional academic achievement" to being asked to repair some computers unless you happen to be in a computer repair program. You'd want to emphasize that academic achievement and whatever lead to your professor believing you'd be good at repairing computers not the day you spent volunteering. 

Ethics is always a touchy matter since different schools of thought are likely to arrive at different conclusions. Legally, if you are in a country that permits you to take two months of paternity leave, it is virtually certain that you are well within your legal rights to withold a desire to do so (particularly one which may or may not come to fruition) from a potential employer. Practically, however, I would question the wisdom of your course of action. Off the bat, your employer seems to be telling you that its concept of work-life balance is at odds with the sort of balance you appear to want in your life. That sort of conflict is likely to appear throughout your tenure at this employer, not just if and when a second child arrives. What happens if you decide to take a day off to deal with a sick kid or you want to take a couple of hours off during the day to go to a prenatal appointment with your wife? Your potential employer is also signalling that its approach to project management judges it reasonable from the outset to basically eliminate all slack in the timeline, including slack for things like vacation time, in a project with an implementation phase that stretches for two years. That is a pretty poor approach to project management that virtually guarantees that there will be more unrealistic assumptions and requests going forward. What happens if the scope grows or some component takes longer than they're expecting and they ask everyone to "pitch in" and work extra hours every week? If you take two months of paternity leave, are you going to find yourself blamed (rightly or wrongly) for any and all delays or failings in the project? Even if you successfully navigate the legal and political minefield, after you devote yourself to a project that is already under severe schedule pressure for two long years, is it likely that the company is going to conclude that user18600 is a top notch employee that went above and beyond and reward you with a promotion? Or is it more likely that the company is going to conclude that user18600 doesn't fit in with the culture of the company, abandoned the team for two months, and only narrowly averted disaster? Given the signals the company is putting out, it seems highly likely that you'll have constant work-life conflicts and that the project is going to be a death march until it is either cancelled or limps across the finish line over budget, past deadline, and with less functionality that the users currently expect.
