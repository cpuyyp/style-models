Just to add to @Henry's answer (+1): If you go to the NOAA webpage for downloading the data, at the top of the page it says: 

In addition to Articuno's answer (+1): Lets look at the first reason Ridley gives for RCP8.5 not being realistic: 

Obviously the 1998 super El-Nino spike is rather smaller in the surface temperature dataset than in the RSS dataset, and if you try and plot the trend from about September 1996, you find it is clearly upward in the HadCRUT4 dataset. 

In addition to Konrad's excellent answer, another way we can know that volcanic CO2 does not exceed anthropogenic CO2 is to look for signs of volcanic eruptions in CO2 data. Here are the Mauna Loa data collected by the [Scripps Institution]:1 

which suggests that the reason for the change in record is due to a change in the dataset (set of stations) used to compute the mean temperature, and that the change was announced and clearly indicated to those downloading the data. It is a shame that the blogs and media didin't bother to investigate the reasons for the change before assuming that NOAA has made an adjustment without explanation. The announcement is here. 

The claim is repeated in a few online news articles, e.g., hindustantimes.com, firstpost.com, NDTV.com, but seems to be contradicted by Zakir Naik himself ("I have always condemned terrorism" in the above). Question: Did Zakir Naik say "every Muslim should be a terrorist"? 

Unfortunately, this statistic is unreferenced (or, at least, it's not directly referenced; there's a bunch of references, but it's not clear which the statistic might be in). I found a similar unreferenced claim in the article 3 Women Are Killed Every Day By Their Partners ... at the Huffington Post and in the article Three Women Are Murdered by Their Husbands, Boyfriends Every Day in America at AlterNet. Question: In the US, are three women killed each day by their male partners? 

Is this true? Or: Did John Safran get a fatwa placed on Australian television host Rove McManus? It supposedly took place in episode one of John Safran vs. God: 

Almost identical quotes can be found on Baptist News Global, an EventBrite event, Before It's News, Christian Examiner, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Charisma News (all dated fairly recently). My question is simply: is the claim true? I find it very hard to believe a transgender woman would be willing to expose herself, let alone to 6-year old girls. I also feel that indecent exposure laws would still apply, transgender or not. 

I've replotted the data below, using woodfortrees.org (They only have monthly rather than annual data, so I've used a 12 month moving average filter). The GWPF have acknowledged that their use of the diagram in the question was incorrect 

N.B. the pre-industrial CO2 level had been around 280ppm for several thousand years (see comments below). There were large volcanic eruptions in 1963 (Agung), 1980 (mt St Helens), 1982 (El Chichon) and 1991 (Pinatubo), none of which left so much as a blip on the measurements taken at Mauna Loa. Or, looking back further in time, we can look at super-volcanoes in the proxy record, such as the Yellowstone supervolcano 640,000 years ago, which again left no trace in the proxy record: 

(via woodfortrees.org). Now I know that cherry picking is bad statistics, so I would not make a claim about the trend from 1980 to 1994 being in any way meaningful based on a cherry-picked trend. The reason that I am doing so is simply to demonstrate that flat trends can easily be cherry-picked from noisy time series data if that is what you really want to do. Now the trend I have cherry picked is shorter than the one cherry picked in the diagram in the original question, but then again the one in the question has the advantage of the spike caused by the 1998 super El-nino event, which is basically what allows such a long trend to be cherry picked. This leads me on to the second bit of cherry picking, which is why the RSS dataset (derived from satellite measurements of the lower trophosphere) rather than a surface temperature dataset? I suspect because the satellite derived datasets are more sensitive to the effects of El-Nino, which is apparent if I plot the RSS and HadCRUT4 (an instrumental surface temperature dataset) together (I've added an offset so the differences can be seen more clearly). 

Other sources: Information Engine; The Simple Truth; WHIS News. (There is also a YouTube video, although I can't access it from China, so I'm unaware of its contents.) I'm pretty sure this is just made up (or a hoax?). Can this be confirmed/denied? The image in the news article shows an exhausted looking woman surrounded by 17 babies. Their motor skills are too advanced for babies born "last weekend". The woman also appears to be of a different ethnicity to the babies. (Although, there might be some explanation for this that I haven't thought of.) It also seems at odds with how difficult it is to give multiple births; Wikipedia writes: 

I can even watch the Dalai Lama and Lady Gaga video at smh.com.au without any problems. I didn't find it particularly interesting, but I had no problems accessing it. 

The Salafi Movement Wikipedia page currently quotes Zakir Naik as saying "every Muslim should be a terrorist". They cite a TIME article: Von Drehle and Ghosh, An Enemy Within: The Making of Najibullah Zazi, 2009, which appears to be replicated here, which says:
