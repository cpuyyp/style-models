I suspect you're thinking that we'd have a summer when the northern hemisphere, for example, is tilted toward the Sun, and a second summer during the perihelion, when the Earth is closest to the Sun. For one thing, the timing doesn't work; the perihelion takes place in early January, close to the northern midwinter. That probably moderates the effects of axial tilt for the northern hemisphere (and amplifies them for the southern hemisphere), but it's not enough to override them. The other answers have said that the axial tilt is a more significant factor than the variation in distance from the Sun, but they haven't explained why. The following is a rough back-of-the-envelope guesstimate. The difference in illumination caused by the varying distance from the Sun can be computed from the ratio between the perihelion and aphelion distance, which is about a factor of 0.967. Applying the inverse square law indicates that amount of sunlight at aphelion is about 93.5% of what it is at perihelion. Reference: $URL$ At my current location (about 33Â° north latitude), at this time of year (close to the northern winter solstice), we're getting about 10 hours of sunlight and 14 hours of darkness each day. (Reference: the weather app on my phone.) That's about 83% of what we'd get with 12 hours of daylight during either equinox, and about 71% of what we'd get with 14 hours of daylight and 10 hours of darkness per day during the summer solstice. The effect is greater at higher latitudes. In addition to that, the sun is lower in the sky during the winter than it is during the summer, meaning that a given amount of sunlight is spread over a larger area of the Earth's surface, which makes the ratio even larger. I don't have the numbers for that, but it's enough to show that the effect of the axial tilt is substantially greater than the effect of the varying distance between the Earth and the Sun. 

What is the period of unique horoscopes? In other words how long does it take before any configuration of the classical planets repeats? The seven classical "wandering stars" are: Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Assume a horoscope is created by dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal regions and then for a particular day noting which region each of the 7 "wandering stars" is occupying relative to the earth. For example, a horoscope could be: Sun in Aries, Moon in Capricorn, Saturn in Taurus, Jupiter in Libra, Mars in Pisces, Venus in Aries, Mercury in Aries. Since Saturn revolves around the sun once every 29 earth years, Jupiter every 12 years, and Mars 1.88 or so, multiplying together we have 654. So, relative to each, they would seem to repeat their configuration every 654 years. This is potentially a complicated question which might require a simulation to determine the answer. For example, today (5 December 2016), the following is true for the tropical zodiac: Sun in Sagittarius Moon in Aquarius Mercury in Capricorn Venus in Capricorn Mars in Aquarius Jupiter in Libra Saturn in Sagittarius So, one instance of this problem would be to determine the next date at which this same configuration will next recur. 

If we were to project the ecliptic out as an infinite plane, what visible star (besides the sun) would lie closest to it? 

There seem to be irregularities in the motion of the earth, so we add "leap seconds" to adjust our time accordingly. Since 1972 there have been 26 leap seconds I think. If we extrapolate that backwards 0.5 leap seconds per year, it would be 1 leap minute in 120 years and 5 leap minutes in 600 years. Would this be enough to throw off a prediction of an eclipse? In other words, could someone in 1416 predict an eclipse right now given the unpredictable errors caused by leap seconds? 

(I suppose there could be a third answer. If humans were able to put a colony on the surface of the Sun, using some advanced technology that obviously doesn't exist yet, it's likely they'd still use an Earth-based calendar to measure time.) 

During a solar eclipse seen from Earth, an observer on the Moon would see the Moon's shadow on the surface of Earth. I don't know of any photos of such a shadow as seen from the Moon, but here's a photo of a solar eclipse seen from the Mir space station in 1999. 

As indicated in the comments, the is the ISO 8601 syntax for the time zone. Specifically, it indicates a time zone 2 hours east of UTC. indicates that the site is hosted in Berlin, Germany, which is consistent with the time zone. The fact that the data includes the date and time zone but not the time is probably an error. This particular datum is Tom Cruise's birthday; in fact he was born on that day in Syracuse, New York. A data representation that includes a date and time zone but no time is peculiar, and I'm not sure that it conforms to the ISO 8601 standard. The description in the Wikipedia article seems to imply that a time zone can only follow a time. I haven't checked the standard itself. A representation of just the date: would make more sense, and would be more useful. This is probably a bug in the software that runs dbpedia.org. 

It's almost 100% stars. In good conditions, you can see perhaps 2000 stars. (There are about 6000 naked-eye visible stars; of these, 3000 are above the horizon at any time, and about 1000 are hidden because they're too close to the horizon and blocked by the atmosphere.) The number of non-star objects you can see without assistance is tiny in comparison:
