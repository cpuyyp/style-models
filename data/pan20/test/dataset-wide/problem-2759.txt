This would take a bit more context to really appreciate which I'm not sure we'll be able to sufficiently offer here; a proper discussion might be article-length and would likely be somewhat inconclusive even then. At any rate, while perhaps not an ultimate answer, Appiah's take on this is pretty interesting (my emphasis): 

As the section is not really that long (~500 words); and since I've tried to argue before for having as much context as reasonably possible when discussing Nietzsche, I reproduce the section in its entirety below (with my emphasis and some commentary interspersed): 

Ockham's Razor would initially indeed seem to suggest that the simulation hypothesis 'requires less assumptions'; however given the degree of unknowability here it would seem as difficult to assert this unqualifiedly as it is to imagine a scientific experiment which could validate the principle. In my opinion it's at least apparently unfalsifiable, though as I have suggested above, hypothetically we might run into certain limits imposed by the simulator on the simulation. My sense of the hypothesis is that basically it isn't falsifiable or empirical; there is an analytic dimension to Bostrom's analysis here that simply can't be validated in any experimental way. Hence I don't think it poses a significant problem for scientific realism. Finally, it may help to recall Bostrom's own conclusion: 

The point is presumably to demonstrate this very property of double negation: for classical logic, complementation involutes (i.e., for every a, a'' is logically equivalent to a). Note that p and p'' are structurally distinct, even though truth-equivalent. An application of a rule that complementation involutes is "required" to reduce one to the other. 

You might consider looking at Catherine Malabou on this problem today, who is concerned with the plasticity of the brain — both its capacity for growth and dynamic development, but also its potential for destruction, breakdown; dissolutions. Damage to memory and cognition eventually wear away the substrate of “personality” — but even though “you” have been effectively lost beyond recovery, this was all still in a way “you” since these are transformations your organs were always capable of undergoing, part of their internal possibilities. (The plasticity of the brain cuts both ways — allowing us to learn and heal, “route around” damaged components; but also permitting collapse, degeneration, erasure, etc.) 

Deleuze and Guattari argue in What is Philosophy? that it's not false to say philosophers are to blame for revolutions, even though they are not the ones who lead them. I think among other things this may point towards the generally reactionary conditions of academic philosophy despite the radicality of particular thinkers. 

In the interest of not making this about Leiter (since I'm having trouble framing any of that constructively)... Personally, I would suggest reading some other sources on Nietzsche. I'm favorable to Deleuze (Nietzsche and Philosophy) but Sloterdijk (Nietzsche Apostle), Klossowski (Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle) are really interesting takes as well. Spinoza's philosophy is curiously 'symmetric' to Nietzsche, as Deleuze hastens to elaborate; so perhaps he is another potential entrypoint into Nietzsche's singular point of view. 

Immediately following this, they invoke the Rimbaud we discussed above about self-identification with racial aleatoriness and inferiority: 

On this last point: the work may seem "over-saturated" but the radical horizontalism implied here is liberating, and even points towards a new universalism, even future images of thought. That art/science/philosophy are different creative practices, different abstract filters over chaos -- not better or worse, harder or easier, higher or lower, etc -- this is roughly one of the theses of What is Philosophy?, which may help provide some overall context and motivation for their effort; where (as they say) they ask this question of what they have been doing all their lives. 

I think it would be pretty difficult to try to plow through all of it in one single study without some preparation. That said, here are some general thoughts: 

I would differentiate knowledge from learning. They may even almost appear opposed at first. Knowledge here as closed schema, static hierarchies, systematized distances -- pre-formatted affects, percepts, concepts. At the limit knowledge is "what everyone knows", or the common-superficial image of thinking. Whereas learning is open, dynamic, horizontal, et cetera. The general system of knowledge is an assemblage -- it is rooted or at least hierarchical, as though flowing from principles, and permits us to believe in its universality and naturalness (the certainty that good will is sufficient to discover the truth.) Learning is an encounter, a series of critical events distributed around a singular process of assembly with an outside. It exposes us to chance, new responses. It does not reproduce a structure, but passively permits one to emerge through modulation, developing and organizing it as the phase-space engendered by the phenomena is navigated. Experimental or empirical knowledge as opposed to rational or pure knowledge is one way to render this. But perhaps the trick comes in seeing one from the perspective of the other; sickness from the perspective of health. Not a relativity of truth but rather a more subtle truth of relativity. Struggle versus memory, differential repetition versus direct reproduction: there are different kinds of truth, noble truths and vulgar truths; with the different ways of feeling and the different images of thought that they deserve. We have the opinions we deserve; but I am tempted to emphasize here our feelings, our capacity to be affected and become-sensitive to different signs or phenomena, to new distributions of the intolerable and tolerable, the remarkable and the uninteresting -- our capacity to create new senses, new problems, be affected by different things, feel differently, and finally think differently. The transition between phases of a life or points of view (that makes us 'idiots') also brings new opportunities for development and organization, even new conceptual and perceptual potentials -- being affected by new signs, forced by them to a new labor of decoding, the work of thinking (which never exhausts or perhaps even touches what it 'thinks it thinks'...) 

One way of thinking infinity is that it measures an arbitrarily large set (or characterizes arbitrarily fast speeds, etc.) The basic idea is that a given property is true regardless of how large something becomes or to what speed it accelerates. Let's consider this object continuously increasing in size over time. It is clear it can become however large we want it given we are willing to wait some amount of time for the object to grow. This seems to my mind to imply that any description of the size of this object will be correct at some point (given it is larger than the "initial" size of the object.) So, for instance, if we wish to assert of the size of this object will be 15m, and assuming the object began growing when it was smaller than this, at some point in time it will be 15m exactly. As you suggest, if the object is enduring a continuous transformation of its size, while there is a precise moment when this property is true of the object, nevertheless its duration is infinitesimal, and it is already past before any indication is possible. However it is of course possible to formulate rigorous functions to show the continuous variation in size, inferring a derivative rate of growth, which constitutes an adequate description at every moment in time. Functions are universal in this sense; they can capture transformations as variable maps. As a quick commentary here, we are very close to the heart of science and mathematics: that is to say, the creation of functions, delicate sieves capable of capturing every point in a continuous transformation through abstraction, implicating the distribution of points in depth. Creating a function means plunging into chaos and extracting free variables to assemble new equations, isolating time or space, extruding the imperceptible lines of structural or genetic organization which articulate all the moments of growth and development. 

The moral problem Kant finds in lying is indeed universal, and would presumably apply to lying by omission as much as outright fabulation. In any case my understanding is that it's the moral failing involved in taking another human being as a means to an end which is important. Language is the primary medium through which social exchange takes place; it is not your words or the lack thereof that you ought to blame. The problem is that lying is always manipulative, a way in which one person disregards the humanity of another. The categorical imperative is a way to express this "always": the very nature of the action is such that it effectively bars itself from being performed morally, i.e., strictly treating others as ends in themselves rather than a means towards your own goals. Here's a few papers on the subject of Kant and lying that might be helpful to start getting our arms around this question: 

While I'm not sure about this, here is one other guess. This phrase may very well be part of a criticism of the apparent political apathy of Henry David Thoreau, who wrote a treatise on civil disobedience and then indeed retreated from public life into "the woods" (house at Walden pond) to "seek truth" (compose his masterpiece Walden.) I have been unable to find anything else on this at all. 

This seems to fit in with what would be my "instinctual" reading of the maxim, which I was tempted to expand upon in the comments -- that women are the uncomplaining victims of a kind of astonishing biological-cosmic-social conspiracy. The remark, strange as it sounds, is "pro-feminist" in the sense that, as D+G might put it, feminists can never take their "becoming-woman" far enough. I think we definitely miss the point if we reduce the insight here to the level of procreation-filiation, even at the asymptotic limit of giving birth to the "overman" -- here I am tempted to remind us of Derrida's remarks about mothers, especially about "thinking" mothers; he says they are something like the most important thing, the point of his work... At any rate this seems to me resonant with the sentiment I feel like Nietzsche might be articulating here. In terms of places to explore further I might suggest referring to Derrida's Spurs; Deleuze's Nietzsche and Philosophy also might be particularly useful here. 

What are the major points of Quentin Meillassoux's critique of correlationism? I am beginning to work through After Finitude and am finding it difficult to grasp exactly what his critique consists in; it feels like there is a considerable degree of finesse here. I am basically trying to establish a concise statement of his criticism, including some help putting correlationism in context. 

I will have to defer to classicists and Plato scholars for secondary literature on the theme in the Platonic oeuvre. Note the bibliography for Wikipedia's entry on "daemons" in classical mythology cites M. Joyal's "To Daimonion and the Socratic Problem" (from Apeiron, vol. 38 no. 2, 2005); I can't speak to the text but it sounds like it may be worth a look. For the perhaps more general problem of demons from a philosophical or psychoanalytic perspective, I might suggest looking at Reza Negarestani's Cyclonopedia for serious discussions of demons and demonology. Nick Land's work may also offer some insight into the problem; I might suggest Fanged Noumena, a collection of his essays. Finally note that pleateau/chapter 10 of A Thousand Plateaus, "Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal", explicitly delves into the problem of demons -- "It can be said that becoming-animal is an affair of sorcery because (1) It implies an initial relation of alliance with a demon..." (p. 272) 

What is a thing outside of its qualities, beyond all the forces it exerts on other things, or which are imposed upon it (the affects it generates or undergoes)? I would suggest looking into Deleuze and Laruelle for more around the question of qualities of objects 'foreclosed' to certain images of thought; and Heidegger/Harman on the question of withdrawn essences of objects. That said, and (much) too quickly: the idea of a de-qualified or property-less entity appears to raise the tricky question of objects whose essences are in flight, or foreclosed to/withdrawn from the field of thinking. Such a transcendental reduction of empirical properties is common with the generic objects of science or mathematics -- although there is still in this case a minimal kernel of recognitional content (even if the content is now reduced to an abstract manifold or 'pure' container.) Are pure metaphysical 'entities' -- i.e., radical immanence, the One, etc. -- somehow beyond being, as in the classical formulation of antiquity? In this case I might suggest it is more like these de-qualified entities expel being(s) beyond themselves. For instance: if immanence has no qualities (at least that can be validated by philosophical thinking,) this also means it is radically indifferent to the properties that may be assigned to it. This implies a kind of deep equivalence of all theoretical positions: since immanence is not a natural object of thought, but rather profoundly cut out from the philosophical image of thought, it is no longer graspable through a stable perspective or static point of view which would impose sense or an image upon it. 

A quick qualification: Laruelle's decades-spanning project is going to be something very difficult to convey accurately in a few paragraphs, especially when trying to field the supplemental questions you pose here. It might make sense to try to approach all this a bit more straightforwardly, slowly, incrementally -- if a careful, pedagogical explanation of the material is actually what you're after :) Another qualification: while I am not really an expert on Laruelle, I have attempted to read it in good faith, and have plugged through a lot of his work that's available in English. Finally, I do find myself quite sympathetic to his project. More or less the basis of my own interest in Laruelle, and at the very least a key reference, is Deleuze and Guattari who at the end of What is Philosophy? talk about nonart, nonscience, and nonphilosophy as "outsides" of art, science, philosophy. These negations form part of a shadow which renders art/science/philosophy indiscernible; the shadow of a future people, a people to come, capable of advancing beyond the arbitrary/neurotic/anthropoid divisions between these creational practices (towards a reunified/indivisible art-science-philosophy, something like what Nietzsche talks about with his joyful wisdom which would reunite art and science once they have sufficiently "matured".) Philosophy needs a nonphilosophy to comprehend it, D+G say. It is definitely a nod to Laruelle and they mention him as one of the most interesting working contemporary French philosophers in a footnote (note this was some 20 years ago.) Okay. So let's start thinking about decisions, or as you emphasize distinctions or "dialectical splittings". This may seem odd, but Laruelle's point that all philosophies are structured around a prior decision is not an "axiom" for him; rather it is the axiomatic character of philosophy that is here captured in a kind of non-axiomatic way. The decisional structure of philosophy demands not an analysis based on assumptions; but as he says a kind of "dualysis"... Laruelle identifies something like a Godel-effect operating over the informal-abstract conceptual phase-spaces through which philosophy traces its cognitive trajectories, constructs its planes of reference, effracts new conceptual schema, etc. There is a hole in every philosophical plane of thetic organization. Concepts or system of concepts which populate these planes, and the discourses disclosing them, cannot avoid these vortices. Philosophy inevitably relies on obscure distinctions (confused decisions) that cannot be grasped by that philosophy in itself, or rather that require new concepts ad infinitum. I am tempted here to talk about the fractality of sense or thought, the fragmentation of philosophical "dimensionality". But again this is really endemic to an image of thought called "philosophy" (Aristotle says Zeno invented the dialectic with his paradoxes of motion.) One key to my mind is the "non-Marxism" of Laruelle; as Deleuze says, for most of history, philosophy amounts to an image of thought that enforces stupidity, that actuallys stops people from thinking. Laruelle says something to the effect that future generations may not show the same gratitude towards philosophy -- and its repressive, neurotic, stunting effect on human thought and ultimately life on the planet -- that we are still hypnotized into showing today. Nonphilosophy is a kind of generalization of Marxism, at its humanist core a project about improving the condition of humanity in the world. For Laruelle, radical immanence is "humanity in person". So Laruelle posits the "transcendental" equivalence of all philosophical positions: a kind of "suspension" of certain philosophical axioms in order to open up a space for thought, experimentation, learning, creation, etc., outside the (regressive, exploitative, philosophical) image of thinking, knowing, creating; making use of philosophical materials in new ways... Hopefully this represents some starting points and helps give a sense of the spirit of the work. Apologies for the obscurity/sparseness of this presentation (it is going to be difficult to summarize his project briefly, and it may be more constructive to approach the subject a bit more iteratively; please consider asking further questions here!) Laruelle's work is definitely difficult, but can also be incredibly rewarding; I would definitely recommend looking at Philosophy and Non-Philosophy and Principles of Non-Philosophy, both of which should now be available in English translation. 

Others have already commented on the concept itself, and I am certainly not a Leibniz expert, so I'd just like to recommend a look at The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque, which deals with the concept of the monad in some depth. Google says the words 'monad' and 'time' show up together on 19 different pages of the text; from the fourth result of that query: 

Note that D+G actually say very explicitly, not only is understanding the BwO as image already "the" error of psychoanalysis, but it misses everything about indefinite articles and infinitely auto-constructive assemblages:
