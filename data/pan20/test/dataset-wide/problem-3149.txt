Oh the other hand, Soviet propaganda was rife with fictitious stories to boost morale during a time when the war was so uncertain. 

Dr. Peter Gay of Yale University has described the Puritans' standard reputation for "dour prudery" as a "misreading that went unquestioned in the nineteenth century." He commented that Puritans were unpuritanical and rather in favour of married sexuality, and opposed to the Catholic view of virginity/celibacy. Gay, Peter (1984), The Bourgeois Experience: The Tender Passion, W. W. Norton & Company, p. 49, ISBN 9780393319033 Note: Progressive today carries a connotation that is much more permissive than the puritans, but that doesn't mean Puritans deserved the label Prude: Catholics and Victorians could definitely be called Prudes though. Catholics can likely trace their celibacy arguments back to Augustine, while Victorians were strongly influenced by the Enlightenment as the articles in the question mentioned. For their time Puritans could be considered progressive, but in our modern context I would describe them as balanced, which is neither prudish nor progressive. It is fascinating that the abstinence movement of today mirrors both the Victorians and the Catholics. Puritans would be more likely to advocate healthy sexuality as God's sacred design, which would involve verbal and relational intimacy leading up to marriage instead of saying "sex is bad". [edit] Dualism: the belief that thing of the flesh are inherently sinful while spiritual things are holy seems to be the foundation of the "sex is bad" view. The following excerpt is from p.48-49 of Gay's book as I found it on Amazon preview. 

This is most likely pure fiction. Faberge made his famous eggs for Russian royal family since 1885. Out of all of pre-1901 (i.e made before Queen Victoria's death) Faberge-made imperial eggs only one is not accounted for in lists of tzar's property seized by the Soviets during the Russian Revolution - the Mauve egg, made in 1897. All other eggs are traceable at least until 1922. Could Victoria have that egg shattered? Definitely not by her own hand - first, none of the eggs are known to leave Russia before the Revolution, and she never visited Russia in person; second - there is no record of how the egg was lost, and its destruction by the English Queen would definitely had been notable enough to leave a trace in history. On the other hand, Queen might've referred metaphorically to one of the several occasions she disrupted Russian Emperors' plans - in time of her rule, Britain's and Russia's interests often clashed. In this case, from this short phrase it's impossible to tell which of four Russian Emperors whose time in power intersected with her own she meant. 

Just speculating here, but moving sterling from Britain to India would have been rather expensive back in the day. Also, minting sterling in India would have been risky to the currency back home since in those days currencies were based on the gold standard and Indian mints could easily have diluted the metals and thereby the home currency. also, it sounds like (I don't really know) India already had a currency that was easily interchangeable based on the Gold standard...unlike today's fiat floating currencies that always change. 

The history of Western atrocities in China is often glossed over: this would not be possible without also glossing over Japanese atrocities in China. The Japanese atrocities of war in the Pacific are easy to forget because of Pearl Harbour, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bookends receive much more attention than the books. It is ironic considering more Germans died in Dresden than did Japanese in either of the nukes. Stalin would be another distraction. The Japanese downplay their vices, while the Germans crucify themselves for what their parents did. The state of Israel and the European Union are both direct responses to German atrocities in WWII that remain active in the public consciousness. Japan on the other hand glosses over its atrocities, which is easier to do in their Buddhist/Taoist culture than in Christian Germany. The Chinese are very conscious of Japanese atrocities. It is only the west that has forgotten. 

Strictly speaking, first fossil fuel pipeline in USSR territory would be the the Balakhanu-Black City pipeline, built in 1878 by Vladimir Shukhov, renowned for his innovations in oil industry and in industrial architecture in general, for The Petroleum Production Company Nobel Brothers, Limited in Baku - one of the first pipeline transport systems in history. That was just a local 10 km long well-to-refinery pipeline, and for a long time all Russian pipelines were confined to this small scale. First major Russian pipeline, Grozny - Port Petrovsky (now called Mahachkala), was launched only in July of 1914. Thus, USSR inherited from Russian Empire this one major pipeline and several networks of local pipelines, amounting to ~1300 km of pipelines. The first major pipeline built in USSR was the Baku-Batumi pipeline, which was launched in 1930. By 1941 there were 4100 km of pipelines, transporting 7.9m tons of oil annually. As for why you did not read about Russians destroying pipelines when retreating - as far as I know by that point there were little to no pipelines to the west of Moscow. German forces never reached any major pipelines, thus there were no need to destroy any of them. Sources: 1) Шаммазов А.М., Мастобаев Б.Н., Сощенко А.Е.

Although arabs are official "semites" historically, "Anti-semitic" is really meant in this context as "anti-Jewish". That's slightly confusing, I know, but Hitler didn't dislike the historical semite people for a "the semitic people did xyz bad thing"... he "only" hated the Jews because he blamed them specifically for various problems in Germany at the time. It's equivalent to if I today chose to hate Germany because I think their flag is silly: that doesn't necessarily mean I hate Germanic people (including Austrians, who's flag I like)... it's a semantic difference. You might then say I was anti-Germanic, which sounds correct but isn't really. I'm anti-Germany, not anti-Germanic This is different from me saying "the historical Germanic people invaded my country and said mean things about my mother, so I hate both Germans, Austrians and anyone else descended from a Germanic tribe" in which case it would be true to say that I am anti-Germanic. In short, we should really say Hitler was anti-Jewish not anti-Semitic: but in recent years "Semite" and "Semitic" have been primarily used to refer to the Jewish people, rather than all Semite-descended peoples. 

The whole event was a bit more complex than a simple annexation. In XVI century Astrakhan Khanate was a point where clashed interests of Turkey and Crimean Khanate on one side, and Russia and Nogai Horde on the other, due to the importance of the city as a trading hub. The rulers changed often (basically, if a ruler leaned to one side - the other side raided the khanate and installed their marionette). Russia only came into the picture after conquering Kazan - it came in contact with, and consequently became an ally to the Nogais. In fact, the expedition of 1554 was planned by a request from Nogay Horde ruler (well, one of the rulers - by then it was already falling to internal power struggle), and Dervish-Ali was a Nogai proponent - who actually was Astrakhanian Khan before Crimeans raided the city in 1547 and installed their own ruler. So, the goal of the expedition wasn't the conquest of the city - it was reinstallment of an allied ruler. Nogai forces failed to join the Russians for some reason, and thus Dervish-Ali became a vassal to Moscow after the victory. He almost immediately switched allegiance, though, and tried to achieve independence with Osman backing - but that, as we know, did not end well for him, and, as it was normal for Russia back then, rebel's lands were confiscated by the Tzar. After that, most of the Nogai Horde became vassals of Russian tzar, and the rest broke away and allied with Crimea and Turkey. Source (russian language) 

I have recently encountered two independent assertions that Puritans were not prudes like I and most of society think they were. Either society's view of Puritans is revisionist, or the two sources I read are wrong. 

(from $URL$ My best hypothesis is that the lines may be related to Rhumb lines and therefore Mercator projections. Beautiful Example. 

Erwin König Was a sniper supposedly killed by Vasily Zaytsev in the Battle of Stalingrad. The diary of Vasily Zaytsev mentions killing Erwin Konig, and there is a sniper scope in Russia, but there is no record of Erwin in Germany. Now the conspiracy theory: (from Erwin Konig's wiki page) 

The second source is the book, "Love is a Choice" p.230, which says, "Only in the last few hundred years, since the French Revolution, have reasoning and logic come to dominate the mindset of mainstream Western civilization." The book goes on to mention how Puritanism was founded on verses such as Proverbs 3:5-6, which says "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." Which view of Puritans is accurate? Were they Prudes or Progressives?
