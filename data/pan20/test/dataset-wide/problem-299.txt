The next level of detail beyond what I've mentioned comes in when we include the neurochemical responses from the brain that we don't fully understand yet. For example, does our brain remember that the Alpha 2A receptor was stimulated in response to a medication or an "exciting" stimuli. This comes to the question, does our brain store the chemicals that are produced in a memory, and if so is that how we remember how we've felt when remembering something. Additionally, if it does store these chemicals are they reproduced when remembering something? If they are in fact reproduced when remembering something, is it possible that our brain remembers the chemicals and bits of the memory are stored in long term fully and the rest is fragmented and using associative memory our brain pieces the rest together. In short I don't believe that we can even come close adequately stating how many bytes are stored in a memory, because our fundamental understanding of memory/brain neurochemical pathways are limited. These are my thoughts on the question! 

First I'd like to state that I don't believe that it is actually impossible. The way I see it is that magic is just science we don't understand, and telekinesis/pyrokensis is magic. In same pagan mythology/belief it is said that with enough training and devotion a pagan can gain abilities in divination, telekinesis, and other things thought to be myth. I mean, yes it's highly unlikely, but you can never say it's impossible! Here's my take on telekinesis. Our body has an electromagnetic field surrounding it generated by the fact that our body uses electricity in the firing of neurons. Now if we could control this electromagnetic field and "amp" it up to a much larger level (someone with some mutation that has abnormal bundles of neurons in super high concentrations that aren't cancerous) they theoretically could use their field to interact with out electromagnetic fields. This would allow for telekinesis. Another way this could be done is by using these fields to interact with other electrons/protons and manipulating them to force atom interaction and generate energy, thus propelling an object. My take on pyrokensis would be very similar to my take at telekinesis. With the genetic mutation of abnormal neural bundles in huge quantities. With this you could theoretically interact with protons/electrons and cause them to vibrate/interact with each other. If you can generate enough energy, the energy will turn into heat, and thus something bursts into flame. This could be done with as something as simple as oxygen and thus we have a fire bender! Another thought about these mutations would be the cost on the person. Maintaining that many neural bundles would take a lot of energy to maintain, but I believe it would be a feasable amount. 

Fungi don't possess chloroplasts. They are saprophytic, living by taking in organic matter, such as dead wood or dead soil organisms. That's why you find them left-over food. All of this information is quite neatly summed up in the common saying "They treat us like mushrooms - keep us in the dark and feed us BS". But if you want references, any elementar biology textbook will do. But for more information on mushroom composition, here's a good link: $URL$ Mushrooms and other fungi are especially valuable for their micronutrient and nutraceutical benefits. To get enough calories, though, you need photosynthesizers. And for those, you need visible light, and plenty of it. 

The OP makes it clear that he's referring to sex, and not gender, so let's leave all discussion of gender to one side. Sexual reproduction supercharges evolution. it allows the assortment of genetic materials from two individuals to produce the genome of a third, new, individual, thus ensuring that there are new genes (produced by mutation) and new assortments of genes, produced by meiosis, to face the environment in new ways. But why TWO sexes? The answer is not culturally determined. The answer does not depend on sociology or (other forms of) fiction. It depends on the chemistry of DNA, which forms the double helix we all know and love, thereby making itself stronger and more resistant to random change during life. Let's represent a diploid strand as AA' in one individual, and BB' in a second. These separate into A - A' and B - B' at meiosis. When they combine, they can recombine as AB, A'B, AB', A'B': so where before there were 2 genotypes, there are now 4, and it may be that the new combinations are more advantageous for survival than the old. This is how evolution works. As long as DNA chemistry works this way, this is the way things have to be. Two strands, 2 individuals to contribute their shares. Nature is prolific and ingenious, so at higher levels of organization (and by higher I mean only higher in an organizational sense), all sorts of arrangements to bring this mechanism about are possible. Some of these arrrangements are more likely in physical, chemical, biological or environmental terms than others, and it seems that the two-sex arrangement has particularly high survival value, for it is omnipresent. Let's refer to these as supra-sexual arrangements. Among these survival arrangements is the universal presence of mitochondria in animal cells. Nitochondria are not a third sex. They are originally parasitic microorganisms that became symbiotic in animal cells, giving energy in exchange for protection and transport. This arrangment was obviously highly beneficial. Mitochondria carry their own genes. Eukaryotes produce motile sperm cells and sessile ova. Sperm cells are basically stripped-down packages containg a haploid genome, and little else. Ova contain the genome, in a fully-functioning cell, which contains mitochondria. When this cell is fertilized,, each time thereafter that cell division occurs, each new cell contains about half of the mitochondria of the parent cell, and these mitochondria then reproduce asexually within the cell. So in the adult organism, all the mitochondria are descendants of the originals in the ovum that gave rise to all those cells, which is why we can trace mitochondrial lineages through the mother, but not through the father. In the case of the queen ant cited above, she no doubt requires fertilization by two individuals to produce two types of offspring because these two individuals have slightly different genomes. This is a neat demonstration of a supra-sexual arrangement. Another such supra-sexual arrangement might be the rich bachelor uncle who sets up his nephew in a house of his own so he can get married. This has high survival value, which is why it is common in all human groups. In English we call this nepotism. 

If however that is unsatisfactory; If X Y Z individually denote gender and there can only by hybrid representation of these combinations then that would mean gender must ultimately be determined by another method. Here are a few options: 1) another regulatory gene handles the determination acting as a proverbial coin flip between the two possible options making one chromosome's representation more pronounced. This isn't unheard of in genetics, it generally doesn't happen on this level or with gender but why not. 2) Pseudo environmental- RNA inherited by the hosting mother parent makes the determination. Would be an odd occurrence but also not impossible. NOTE: A sex is nothing more than an organisms distinct template discrepancies between members, broadly covering physical and behavioral traits. This does not constrain itself exclusively to genetics with humans concocting "3rd genders". Even genetically there are cases where offspring aren't either XX or XY but are XXX. So in relation to this argument, definition of the pronunciation of a "sex/gender" is fairly subjective. 

'This sounds too passive' Unfortunately the structures that give fly traps and anemones any kind of motion do not scale well to land based tree sized structures for large fauna sized prey. Lifting something the size of a deer requires to much motion so its better to rely on passive trapping as much as possible. 

No, This is not currently possible as we still don't fully understand the genetics behind intelligence. We also lack the technology for manipulations of this magnitude. Could this someday be possible? Sure, we could theoretically make them smarter than humans currently. The real question is if they are still considered chimps 

I think you need to define 'magic' first. What would seem magical to a child of 7 might not seem so to a physics professor or an engineer. If you'd told an educated 17th-century European that he could see someone on the other side of the world this morning, talk to him, hear him, as if he were in the same room - that might indeed seem magical to him. Then to clinch it, tell him he and this other man could have breakfast together in the same room, at the same table, passing food back and forth to each other. That would seem beyond magical. But to your daughter? Ho hum. So what would she call magical? Probably the ability to be in more than one place at the same time would be the most impressive. Then the ability to know the future in precise detail. Those two are about as magical as you can get. For the first, you'd need to be able to violate the conservation of matter and energy. For the second, you'd also have to violate the laws of entropy. When you violate these, you've trampled over the law of cause and effect, and then nothing at all remains of physics. Which goes to show that if you abandon the smallest part of physics, you lose all of it. I am not saying that we know or understand all of physics, but we have reached a stage where we can say that what we have may be incomplete, but it's an integrated, unified structure with no spare parts to jettison. So you and your daughter have to accept - it's physics or magic, but not both, and you'd better both hope it's physics.
