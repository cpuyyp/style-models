This is a much more extreme example of the deformation of Saturn described in jamesqf's answer. Possibly not what you're looking for, but it makes a nice illustration of just how plastic large planets are under the force of gravity and the apparent centrifugal force of spin. 

Consider semi-submersible large vessels/structures Semi-submersible hull design is capable of amazing stability in high seas. This is achieved by having all significant buoyancy in the craft concentrated in underwater pontoons. The buoyancy provided by the pontoons remains the same when big waves pass overhead: submerged is submerged. The pontoons are joined to a free-standing superstructure that remains above the water's surface at all times. Superstructure and pontoons are joined by strong struts that 

Could people survive intense global warming? If I'm understanding the sense of the question, I'm guessing probably not. Disclaimer #1: @JanDoggen in comments, and answers from @Larethian and @kutschkem, all make a point of questioning how fast the change takes place. This is a key parameter: given a long enough timeframe, survival of the human species at these temperatures is much more plausible. However, because of the way the question was phrased, I'm going to give an answer that assumes an extremely fast warm-up: 50° Fahrenheit (28° Celsius) in no more than 200 years. That seems implausible in planetological terms. But hey. This is Worldbuilding.SE, and we traffic in counterfactuals all the time. :-) Disclaimer #2: Just to be clear on one thing: My answer doesn't apply to the actual world we live in, because neither does the question in the first place. @abcde is asking an interesting worldbuilding hypothetical, and I'm treating it with the respect it deserves. (I feel I have to say this because, in my experience, questions like this tend to activate our genuine concerns about our primary world. This can make sound reasoning difficult, and carry the discussion off-track. Arguing our opinions about what's actually going to happen to us and our inheritors would step all over the original question and not be particularly helpful to @abcde.) 

You can't run away from ecological collapse. The weather patterns will remain crazy. The pests that attack and kill your crops and animals will remain r-selected and thus prone to wild outbursts of population. And the organisms best suited to survival in an unstable environment are microorganisms: bacteria, viruses, yeast, fungi. Things that will kill you and your attempts at sustaining a food population Even @GrandmasterB, in the most staunchly optimistic answer, notes correctly that 

These points could breathe a lot of life back into your original concept, I think. You could have a multigenerational saga on your hands. Or, you could set your story point some centuries after the Landing. What kind of world would it be? Note, too, that when I say "shipwreck" I don't necessarily mean mean a crashed vessel on the world's surface. Shipwreck, in this case, simply means that the ship had to go to an unplanned destination, can no longer depart, and presumably has no reasonable way of signalling for help. Examples: 

It's a pretty rich and fascinating way to consider magic. +1 to both of those answers. I think they are entirely correct. Entirely correct... as long as magic is understood purely in terms of its physical manifestations. But physics is not the only human model of reality. There are other modes of experience. Other ways to think about what "magic" might be. Pardon the little thumbnail, but anything that would do van Gogh's Starry Night over the Rhône justice would be a massive download. 

I have personally seen this principle in action. Working on a submarine doing scientific experiments with FLIP, I was lucky enough to see FLIP holding dead still in heavy seas. ("Lucky" in relative terms. We, diesel-electric and therefore operating on the surface most of the time, were rolling all over the damn place.) There's a bit of footage in this video starting at around 3:40. Yes, it really was like that: FLIP holding stock still in big swells. Made a believer out of me. :-) 

As long as you can keep these issues reasonably stable, you have in fact created an opportunity for a pirate-friendly system civilization. Have fun! 

Again, I don't know whether Keel's account is truthful; but it certainly is plausible. If cobra catchers really do use emergency amputation to save themselves from the highly toxic venom of cobras, then it would follow that emergency amputation would be a reasonable means of preventing your postulated zombification. 

The obvious implications are that digital computing is much cheaper, once you have implemented a computational mechanism with adequately fast switching times, and adequately general logic (e.g. Lambda Calculus.) This is why digital computing has, in our primary world, swamped analog computing: the cost of handbuilt machines, purpose-built to solve one kind of problem, is extremely high compared to general machines that execute cheaply modifiable software. This, however, is an economic consideration. In steampunk, it's more about feasibility and style than about cost/benefit maximization. In terms of computing power, analog machines can readily accomplish tasks that are simply hard programming problems for those of us who write digital software - especially systems and control problems, which involve feedback loops.) Most of the problems involved in engineering and navigating a spacecraft can be neatly solved by analog computation and analog control systems. Expensive technologies that require a lot of craftsmanship are one of the essential characteristics of the steampunk aesthetic. :-) 

All right. This is a very good question. And there are some very good answers. Smart, thoughtful answers. But, given the way the question is stated, it feels like those answers are still thinking inside the box. In general, magic is treated as if it were nothing more than a branch of physics. @Samuel nails this reasoning very nicely: 

Yes, you can do this, sort of. You need to make at least the following changes to your premise: Don't raft big ships together in open ocean. Have them together as a flotilla, working together, acting as motherships for smaller working vessels. Treat the oil-tanker floating city/colony as a temporary thing, working towards something that can be sustained over time. That in itself could be a dramatic decades-long process. A set of modular rafting floats, with some semi-submersible vessels at the center, could, over the long term, be the kind of floating city that you are asking about. I hope? 

The title of the question alone ("Pirates of Earth" at the moment, and I hope it doesn't change) is pretty cool. Sounds like an Edmond Hamilton pulp SF adventure. Anyway... @santiago, if you are looking for a reason for Terrans to be notably, saliently piratical compared to other starfaring races, you have some heavy lifting to do. What makes a pirate? In Earth's nautical history, piracy tended to be a short-lived social phenomenon, one that comes and goes. Typical drivers of oceangoing piracy include: 

Previous answers have done a pretty good job of considering practicalities. I'll add my US$0.02 on some of these: 

If you do not have a compressed air supply: The suggested drawback of divers hemorrhaging out through mouth and nose because of pressure differential is admittedly colorful and dramatic, but absolutely will not happen if you're not giving the divers compressed air. Reason: diaphragm and intracostal muscles are not strong enough to inflate the lungs against a pressure differential, so your divers will not descend while breathing unless they have compressed air. I know this from personal experience: in my teenaged ignorance I tried to see how deep I could go with an adequately rigid tube. It turned out to be a pretty trivial depth, a few feet IIRC. If you do provide compressed air: It's still going to be highly questionable. The likeliest injury would be air embolism, which is often fatal (and frequently causes brain damage when the victim survives.) This happens when ascending with compressed air in the lungs and (naturally enough, if you haven't been trained otherwise) holding your breath all the way to the surface. As the air in your lungs expands, it tends to rupture the alveoli and force its way into the bloodstream. Neurological symptoms (up to and including death) are caused by bubbles blocking blood flow to the brain. The biggest gotcha about air embolism: the maximum expansion happens closest to the surface. In other words, the danger increases as you almost get to to breathable air. :-( Since the only treatment for this is a hyperbaric chamber, your divers in Roman times would be unlikely to receive treatment. Yes, hyperbaric chambers might well be invented - eventually - to treat the commoner malady of the bends, but it's kind of hard to see the engineering thought progressing like that. Romans were good engineers, no question; but they were not much for theoretical physics. And, since this issue is explained by Boyle's Law, which didn't emerge in our world until the 17th Century CE, you would really need to hack your timeline of scientific discovery... 

So, there is the Martians' desired strategic end state. How long will it take the Martians to get it done? In my opinion, you have enough flexibility built into your world here that you can pretty much make it take as long, or as short, a time as you please. Between your ability to modify social, economic, and political conditions on Earth; your ability to tweak the characteristics of your space drive and your precious Martian resource; and your array of Mars Colony scenarios of population and industrial capacity; you could easily set this up to run long or short. Decades? Centuries? Up to you. Your world will support these outcomes. Honestly, now you get the fun part: playing with different parameters to set up a piece of invented future history that is intellectually absorbing, and satisfyingly dramatic. :-) 

This puts us squarely into Imperial territory: the concept of the "wealth pump". An empire exerts control over a foreign territory in order to extract wealth in some form. In this instance, it's defined as a single resource. It's kind of simplistic, but probably useful for present purposes, to say that there are are four main methods of imperial control: 

For what it's worth: I don't have a reference, except a description in Jadoo, a book by John Keel. I have no particular reason to think that this book is accurate in any particular - it seems, if I'm recalling it correctly (I read the book a long time ago) to be a sort of hybrid of Baron Munchausen and Aleister Crowley - in other words, largely invented. However: even books of tall tales usually have an underlying layer of accurate observation, upon which the fabrications are built. This bit is more plausible than most. Keel describes cobra catchers in Egypt carrying straight razors as part of their field kit. In the rare case of an unfortunate accident, they will promptly lop off a finger that gets bitten by the cobra. This is actually a reasonable proxy for your zombie bite. Cobras have a documented tendency to hang on and chew rather than delivering the lightning strike characteristic of vipers with their more effective hypodermic fangs. From the Fascinating Earth article on the King Cobra: 

This is a great question, with serious applicability for worldbuilding at large. Lots of useful answers so far. I've got one, if I can express it well enough, that goes down to some very basic questions about human ecology. First though, lets get some terminology down: "Tribe", according to the general definition in the Wikipedia article means: 

It sounds, from the wording of the question, that your story purposes are best served by at least some prospect of meaningful combat. I hope you can pull it off; this sounds pretty cool. 

Why humans probably wouldn't survive such an intense global warming event: This is a question of planetary ecology. With a tip of the hat to @JackAidley and @jamesqf, the question of human survival is less a question of how you find a survivable latitude/altitude in the rapidly heating world. It's about what happens in the years after you've arrived. Many of the answers here assume, rightly, that humans would have to migrate for survival. Migration is hard; but let's talk about the survivors. Let's talk about the skilled, prepared, and extremely lucky people who actually make it to some reasonable place in northern or southern uplands. Suppose you're one of those lucky ones. You've found a place. Now what are you going to do for food? Never mind medicine, weapons, shelter, etc, and let's take sufficient drinking water as a given: if you don't have food you won't live. Humans are, in the short term, a whole lot more agile and adaptable than their food base. 

If you can answer "yes" to that question, then you have a plausible scenario for the existence of a feudal political system. For this, you will need to tweak your technology, and probably your planetology, to make that happen. To go beyond "a plausible scenario", however, you need to find a situation in which the nested resilience characteristic of feudalism is not merely conceivable, but confers a strong advantage. Some factors that could work toward this include:
