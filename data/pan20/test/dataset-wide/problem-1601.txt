Going through the website, I could easily find the rest of memes, along with the heroin meme. For example, they have a meme saying, that vaccines cause homosexuality: 

Not necessarily. It is Frank Sinatra, but it is reported that the picture is undated. He could be 8, 10 or 12, etc... The article says: 

Apparently, this is an image has been created by blogger Christopher Hudspeth on September 24, 2015, as he published on his blog post titled AMAZON REVIEWS OF NFL QUARTERBACKS where he said:

Is there any studies showing that pedophilia is a mental disorder? When a mental disorder occurs, evidence shows that there can be related to changes in the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the nervous system. To rephrase my question, do pedophilies exhibit a "condition that impacts a person's thinking, feeling or mood may affect and his or her ability to relate to others and function on a daily basis"? Or those are just old-fashionated authoritative claims from here and there? NB: I'll save you some research, this is the wikipedia page for pedophilia, it defined pedophilia as mental disorder but its references do not mention anything about pedophilia. 

Kaye was not convinced of the authenticity of the document, almost proving that the document is forged, he noted on his blog that: 1. Wrong birth place The alleged birth certificate claims that he was born in the “county of Westminster”. But a small research shows that the there is no “county of Westminster” but there is a "city of Westminster". This is true verified on this wikipedia page here: City of Westminster. Searching for County of Westminster returns no matches on: 

In a post, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence has announced that mixing energy drinks (stimulants with a lot of caffeine) with alcohol (depressant) can lead to “wide-awake drunkenness,” where caffeine masks the feeling of drunkenness but does not decrease actual alcohol-related impairment. And as you already know caffeine is stimulant. Therefore, caffeine masks the feeling of drunkenness but does not decrease the actual alcohol-related impairment. Still not convinced? In 2009, someone wanted to study the effects of drinking caffeine after alcohol. Mice were given alcohol followed by the human equivalent of 8 cups of coffee. After the caffeine they seemed more alert, but they were still much worse than sober mice at getting round a maze. Still skeptical because it is study about rats not humans, right? So, it is true that caffeine takes away some of that fatigue when you are sober. To show that you might believe you’re sober when you’re not, NIH studied American college students from 2008. They found out that those who chose drinks containing both alcohol and caffeine, aka energy drinks, were twice as likely to get hurt in an accident and more than twice as likely to accept a lift with a driver who was over the limit. This effect was independent of the amount of alcohol consumed. This is an early study on the topic in which the students choose their own drinks and reported themselves how much they’d drunk. It does illustrate how caffeine could fool people into thinking they're sobering up, and some of the potentially disastrous consequences. So far, I have showed that caffeine won't make you sober, what about any other activity such as exercise? The answer is also no! Your body takes a certain amount of time to metabolize alcohol. The time required (on average one hour) is dependent on the quantity of alcohol dehydrogenase, a famous enzyme, that is present. You cannot make this enzyme more abundant or more effective by drinking coffee, exercising or praying to any flying spaghetti monster; it won't speed up the process. More information and evidence in the post. 

The following is far from being true because according to the Centers for Disease Control (cdc.gov) and Prevention (CDC), vaccine side effects are minor and go away within a few days. It is also worth noting that: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which serves to report, analyze and make incidences of adverse side effects of vaccines, reported many serious effects of vaccine such as permanent disability, or death. However, the website does not cite down any psychological effect of vaccines, not even one. The meme also notes a website at the left corner, somethingawful.com, noting copyright owner or producer of the meme, which makes the meme classified as a parody/humour meme: 

Diet soft drinks and depression are linked to adults (this includes women too). Based on a study by U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, The study analyzed more than 250,000 U.S. adults aged 50 to 71 who answered questions about their beverage consumption between the years 1995 and 1996. 10 years later (from 2004 to 2006), the same people were asked if a doctor had diagnosed them with depression since the year 2000. People who regularly drank 4 or more cans of any type of soda a day were 30 percent more likely to get diagnosed with depression than people who didn't. The risk of depression was especially high for people who drank diet soda — a 31% increased risk compared to a 22% increased risk for those who drank regular soda, the study said. 

Note the extreme importance of third reference, where Spock explains what he wrote on "How to Not Bring Up A Bratty Child." on February 1974. Also, as a double check for the validity of the claims, those are the references mentioned by the U.S. Department of Education, a governamental source: 

Additionally, Weight-loss surgery appeared to prolong life for severely obese adults, a new study of U.S. veterans found here. . Correction of the claim: Some studies suggest that weight loss (resulting from surgeries) might prolong life. 

Yes, bouncing batteries tell you if they are charged or not. The claim started with this YouTube video: 

However, the report didn't mention anything about any handcuffed or bound hands. This question is unanswerable. 

In 31th of October 2013, the American Psychological Association published a statement regarding pedophilia: 

Dan Wieden, co-founder of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy and advertising executive of Nike, said in an interview with Dezeen that he came up with the slogan because he got inspired by Utah killer Gary Gilmore. Gilmore was sentenced to death in 1977 for robbing and murdering two men. Here is a sample of his interview with dezeen:

If you click on journal Diabetes Care, you will find an academic/scholarly article. Guess what is the most important thing in academic/scholary articles? They have to pass an academic quality assessment before they can be published in an academic journal. Usually, they always start with an abstract which is a short summary of the article as well as a description of the objective, method, result and conclusion of the study. This is the abstract of the academic article Huffington Post took info from. 

And another meme is saying that vaccines cause everything single disease in this world: Creators of those memes refer to themselves as Goons. It seems also that they have weekly activity called "photoshop phriday": 

Digging deeper, I found that, according to a governmental report: 2) there is a causal link between physical exercise and reduction in risk in all-cause mortality, all CVDs combined, CHD, hypertension, colon cancer, and NIDDM. 

The best evidence which could be provided here is a Death Certificate, but it seems you won't find that easily online. Many users have been skeptical about his death and they have expressed their thoughts here, here and here. I found an article published on 06 Jan 1993, by The Windsor Star, a newspaper, which seems seem to be pretty reputable, it has been published on "proquest.com". It has an abstract, can be cited and used in research. If you can't access the article (due to country restriction or sign up/login) I have exported it to my GDrive here. The article explicitly mentions that: 

EVIDENCE 2: A famous report by New York Times back in 1987 reported that the fibre optic cables linking the US, Europe and Japan were being nibbled persistently by sharks, causing phone and computer failures around the world. The article also reported what was presented in Evidence 1, but adding as extra Dr. Nelson's claims: 

First, I have to agree that Wikipedia's source Windor Public Library isn't that convincing. The only thing that Windor Public Library provided was this database entry: 

The advertisement was created for Berlitz Corporation and made by BTS United. According to the following website:

A video on Facebook went viral called "Talent show Judges ask 16-year-old girl if she believes in God" that has subtitles claiming that a whole judge panel evaluated a girl based on her belief in God: 

Because the claim didn't mention which type of vaccines will cause heroin injection, and had the slogan "protect your children from vaccinations", the meme's target was all vaccines, therefore paraphrasing the claim would lead to: Any vaccine given to children will make them inject more heroin than others. The following is not true, because there has been one vaccine (at least) which blocks compulsive intake of heroin. In the report, scientists at The Scripps Research Institute have reported successful preclinical tests of a new vaccine against heroin. The scientific report concluded that the vaccine: 

However, there are many problems with Holmes, his claim and the video. Here they are: Nessie, a modern-day myth According to The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions, the scientific community regards the Loss Ness Monster as a modern-day myth 

you would notice bizarre thing about this paper is that this claim is unreferenced. Finally, I found a referenced academic article by Appetite which actually say the opposite: The color red reduces snack food and soft drink intake From Abstract:
