What you now know is never do such a thing at work again. If you feel the need to say nasty things about your boss to get them out of your system, do it at home and never bring the paper or the file into the office. At the office, if he brings it up, apologize profusely and explain that you never intended for the list to be seen. If he doesn't bring it up and since you have already quit, simply work out your time quietly and accept any tasks he gives you and try to limit contact. Make sure to leave like a professional and prepare something that will give your replacement a starting point such as a document with all the things he needs to know and make sure to keep any personal opinions out of it. You need to think about what you put on the list and how realistic or unrealistic it is. Lots of younger workers think any management by their boss is a control freak. Think about what his job responsibilities are when you think about why they annoy you. You can't just be left alone to work with no one ever bothering you. That is unrealistic thinking. People do need to have progess reports and they need to pass information up the chain. I am not saying you are right or wrong in your current assessment but you need to be able to step back away from your feelings and determine if you are over reacting. And finally it is far more profitable to concentrate on what is good than what is bad. You can make yourself unhappy in a perfectly good situation by concentrating only on the bad. Every job has problems, no boss is perfect and neither are you. Learn not to dwell on the bad especially if it is something (like someone else's personality) that cannot be changed. 

There are two purposes to the self appraisal. The first is to remind your busy boss of what you have done The best bosses keep notes but even they miss some things. Most bosses just don't (or worse only keep the complaints so there is no good to balance them) and need to be reminded. It also makes it easier for him to sell the management committee on giving you a better raise. The second is for the boss to check to see if your impressions of your performance and his are aligned. This helps him know if you are going to have an easy conversation on the evaluation or an uncomfortable one which helps him prepare for the meeting. Towards this end, you need to decide what to say. Underselling yourself is usually more disastrous than overselling yourself. Providing less detail is often less successful than providing more. For instance if you rate yourself as having met expectations and he thought you were outstanding, it could well make him reconsider what he thought. If you rate yourself as outstanding and he thinks you are only meeting expectations, he may prepare for an awkward conversation, but it is unlikely he will revise the rating upward or downward. The meat of the information you provide about what specifically you worked on and how well it went is important when the managers get together to determine the final ratings. Very few places let the immediate supervisor do the rating without others involved for budget reasons. Most of the people in the meeting where this is done do not know you or your work (well they might if you properly apply office politics to ensure people are aware of your contributions, but that is a discussion for another time.). They also have people they want to see rewarded. Generally there are more people who deserve the highest ratings than the company can afford to give based on the budget, so they have to look at all the evals together and determine which ones are the ones they will reward. This can be a very difficult and sometimes acrimonious discussion and any positive information you can provide to your boss to help him sell you to the higher ups improves your chances of getting that higher raise. Having more information in your self-appraisal helps your boss sell you as the person who deserves the higher rating. It can also save him significant time in preparing his own side of the appraisal which tend to make him happier with you while he is doing the writing. It is always better to do something that makes your boss feel as if you have helped him out when he is going to be writing about you. The only times I have seen more information backfire is if the boss thinks you are lying about what you did (some people do). In some ways you are better off in trying to sell yourself since the criteria are not defined. I can tell from personal experience, it is very difficult to get an outstanding evaluation when you did something other than the things you were being evaluated on (typically decided a year in advance with little change even when your job duties change significantly), even if they were more difficult and complex things. So be grateful that you can determine some of what you think was important about what you did this year. It actually gives you more scope to propose a higher rating. 

Since it is unlikely the time sheet can be printed until you have clocked out, I don't see what the problem is. Of course, I prefer to actually do the thing that generates my paycheck. Really if you haven't spent five minutes a week not working while clocked in I personally would be amazed. There are likely far more serious issues at your workplace if you and your coworkers are so angry as to want to make an issue over something this minor. I would suggest that you concentrate on the more important things and avoid this one. 

What I do is take a chunk of the information related to the first thing I need to know and thoroughly explore it. I find out where things are in the database, I find out who has responsibility for what, I find out where in the user interface you can find the information and how that information is csent to teh application. I review stored procedures, reporting queries, imports and exports related to the subject at hand. I ask questions like: 

Reasons for immediate performance counseling and possible coming down hard if the person does not improve: 

Never ever under any circumstances ask for a pay raise based on what someone else gets. People with less experience than you may make far more money and people with more may make less. It depends on what the market will bear and the negotiating skills of the person when they were hired. There it would be a rare company that will pay you more becasue they pay somone else more. By all means discuss salary at the review (although I would bring up the subject before the review, at teh review itself, the amount is often set in stone because it was a result of weeks or even months of negotiations between managers to fit all pay raises into the budget.) but do it iterms of what you are contributing and how much more valuable you are now than when your current salary was set. If you write a self-appraisal, themn make sure you document your accomplishments well. That helps your boss sell gving a higher raise to you to the people with the money. 

It is possible this is a problem and possible it is not. Virtually all jobs have an "other tasks as assigned' clause in their job description. If you are the most junior person in the room, then this type of task will naturally go to you. That's part of being junior. If I have to choose between paying someone $100 an hour to do a relatively menial task and someone making $40, it's not a hard choice from a management perspective. If these tasks tend to get passed out to everyone on the team (or everyone below a certain level), again, no problem just do them cheerfully and make sure that you are not picked more often than others. If you are a manager, simply delegate the work unless you are specifically told not to (sometimes managers do this type of work when there is something confidential in the wind). If you the only person on your team ever asked to do these types of things and you coincidentally are the only woman (or in some other group that frequently gets discriminated against), then there is a strong possibly that you have a problem. They actually do not view you in the same way that they view your teammates and it ultimately harms your ability to get promoted or assigned to the more interesting work because people start to view you as less skilled. This is especially true if there are people junior to you who never get asked to do these things. It may even be an unconscious bias. I have worked for plenty of men through the years who thought only women should do such tasks. I didn't put up with it after my first year in the workplace. This is something you would need to discuss with your boss. The first tactic I would try is to pick a time when you are genuinely busy and ask him if Joe (who happens to be the most junior person on the team) could do it instead. This is a gentle reminder to him that there are other people who could be asked and it is often enough for the person to realize that he is showing a bias. If that doesn't work, then you talk to you boss one on one and explain that it makes you uncomfortable to be asked to do these things when your male colleagues are not. It gives the impression to the team that your contribution is less critical and that you are less capable. Make sure to make it clear in various meetings with your boss that you want assignments to the more complex, career-enhancing tasks if you are also going to be stuck with these in order to offset that bad impression. He needs to think of you as someone actively pursuing promotion and someone who is not a doormat. If he continues to assign this stuff only to you after you have discussed why it is a problem, then he has an overt bias and you need to consider moving on to someplace where you will be more appreciated and rewarded. Your work will be viewed as lesser value at reward time and because this is a "meritocracy" (hint, meritocracies never are because it is often the assignments that dictate who gets the rewards and those often suffer from bias) the guys who get the more interesting assignments while you do the clerical work will get the rewards. Each month you let this happen, the less seriously you will be taken and the more likely it will be that you will pay the price in your review and raises and promotion potential. I could probably name a dozen bright talented women I have worked with who fell into this trap (and sometimes it is the woman who has the bias about these tasks and she self-assigns herself into the lessor role especially when it comes to party-planning tasks) and it harmed their careers. 

Ok it sounds like someone from outside came into the role. Typically they have more of an opportunity to negotiate than people do with internal promotions. Get the idea that pay is fair out of your head. Pay is never fair and never will be. People coming in from the outside are subject to different market conditions than people already employed by the company. People may have what you view as a less important or less technical role but how HR sees it may be entirely different. His experience might look better on paper than yours. After all they can;t know his performance until after he accepts the salary can they? Someone coming at the highest level of his pay grade may not get a pay raise at all for several years. Employees who have been there for 5 or more years are likely many thousands below the pay scale of a new employee because they can't get new employees to accept that level. In any organization you can find many people who receive salaries you will not consider fair. The problem is that your list would be different than mine and would be different than any other ten people you asked. Fair is perception. I would imagine there are people in your organization who think you are overpaid. It is literally impossible for HR to set salaries for every person in the organization that every other person would think were fair. You can ask for a pay raise if you want but having gotten a double grade promotion this year, it is highly unlikely they will give you a review. What ever you do, do not base your request on what someone else makes. That is almost a guarantee that you will not get a raise. 

I will also point out that the importance of the thank you note can vary depending on the type of position you are applying for. For instance a sales job may require frequent follow-up and persistence. It may require you to keep in contact through written means with potential or exisitng customers. In this case, a thank you note shows you do have some level of follow through and the text of it might be analyzed to see if you are selling yourself well (after all who wants a salesman who can't even sell himself?) and if your writing skills are up to the job they have. Much of the advice about thank you letters comes from people who sell for a living, so they tend to put a higher emphasis on it than in many professions. For other people, thank you notes are a nice to have and would be unlikely to affect much unless you are truly tied with someone else from a technical standpoint and the tie-breaker will be your social skills. But in most of the interviewing I have done, the decision as to who was still in the running happened long before I would have gotten a thank you. 

Exactly what is to be gained by going to HR? Unless you are looking to get reassigned elsewhere or get the other person fired, HR is not the place for this. If your boss told you the person is having difficulty outside of work, then it is possible she is in a somewhat protected status right now. Consider that he would only know this if there was something very serious going on such as a cancer diagnosis or a death in the family etc. He would legally be constrained from telling you what is going on, but assume that the person is seriously ill or has a family member who is for the sake of dealing with the person. People are generally not themselves when they are seriously stressed. So give this person the same benefit of the doubt that you would want if it were you in the situation. So no, don't take it to HR and, yes, learn to live with it. The easiest thing to do is to train yourself to stop being bothered by it. Every time this person does or says something that indicates jealousy, then you say to yourself, "X is going through a hard time, let it go." and then do so. Your boss is telling you that it is not about you but something else in her life, so don't take what she says personally. Once you stop taking things personally, the workplace becomes much easier to navigate. This is not an easy thing to learn, it may take month or years to get really good at it. But it can be done, I had to do it. It is more about being persistent in noticing that the behavior is not about you and then letting it go. Take steps to help out the person instead of getting upset. Being nice to people you don't like is often an effective way to get them to be more on your side. So take the first step and help them out and compliment their work when deserved. Don't get angry back at catty statements. Take the high road and the other people in the office will respect you more for staying above it. When you get into a "tit for tat" kind of fight with someone else, it doesn't matter who started it, you both look equally bad. So take care of your own reputation by being above it. 

Personally I find most of those automated code tools useless. There are times when it fails code for things that are simply preference and things that are bad in some circumstances but good or even necessary in others. And often they leave the dev unsure about what the actual fix should be. If you know something fails but don't understand why it fails or what you should be doing instead, the tool itself has failed. What does help is 100% code review. No code is committed to the production branch without being accepted through code review and no dev has the rights to commit to the production branch only the build team or the lead. This is where you send back the bad code preferably with an explanation as to why it is bad. The key is to make it painful to not fix the code. Yes they will have a few times where the deadline will be missed because the code failed code review. And they will have to explain that as a reason. This leads people to be less likely to make the same mistake repeatedly so that they can meet their deadlines. If there is no pain to writing bad code, there is no reason to fix it, human nature being what it is. That said, you and your team need to have an agreement concerning what is good code and what is acceptable code. If your standards and theirs are currently in a mismatch, this needs to be resolved over discussions and an agreeable standard approved. If they have input into the standard (and yes that means you need to compromise and accept their standards at least in part, having the discussion is irrelevant, even counterproductive, if you are still going to dictate end results), that are going to have more buy into actually using it.
