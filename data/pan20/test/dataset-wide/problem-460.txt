I have used one of these for a while and used to read while riding it. That worked fine, but once my broken collarbone healed I lost interest (but I live in Sydney where the weather is nice year-round) 

Can you take replacements for the stripped parts from a standard headset? If you have a local bike co-op or a good relationship with your LBS you should be able to try some second hand ones to see if they work, and if so either buy them or buy a new headset and use the parts you need from it (in that case leaving the extra parts with the shop is a nice gesture, and they're more likely to be useful to another customer than to you) 

@Plasma says: I got it working! You're right @Carel, the frame itself wasn't negative, but the back fender somehow was. I didn't check if the entire frame was positive, though, so can't say anyrhing about insulated wires or not. Anyhow, the problem seems to have been a missing connection between the positive and the taillight bulb. I DIYed a new socket for the bulb and did some (possibly redundant) new wiring to connect everything properly. (because I don't like unanswered questions) 

I have repaired a pedal powered toy that had an arrangement like this. It was an Italian ride-on toy tractor that had a modified coaster brake set up so that instead of back pedalling applying a brake, the "brake" mechanism inside the hub locked against the hub body so that you could pedal the toy backwards. The modification didn't seem particularly difficult, but from memory I think a lathe would be required unless you really like filing small amounts off a round part until it fits. 

The main advantage is aerodynamics, but it should also be cheaper, lighter and stronger than a two-piece combination. Aside from the shaping, the fibres will run continuously through both "parts" so there's extra strength from that and there are also no stress risers at the joins making them stronger again. In practice the strength and weight are a trade-off, and there's no point making the bars ridiculously strong so it's very likely that they will be made lighter instead of stronger. Everything else being equal, that would make those bars both cheaper (easier to manufacture, less material) and lighter than a competing two piece product. However, they're likely to be less popular and thus manufactured in smaller quantities than the two pieces, so may well cost more for that reason. A final tiny advantage is that there are four fewer bolts to worry about, so you never have to check the four bolts that hold the bars to the stem or make sure the bars are at the right angle. 

Welded Frame A frame made by melting the tubes it is built from at the joins, typically with a similar metal added as filler. Mass produced aluminium and steel frames are almost all built this way as with modern machines it is very fast and cheap. 

Any kind of epoxy or filler is worth a try because it's cheap and reversible. But those fillers will be softer than even the original aluminium, so they will be ground away faster then ideal. Another approach would be filing a little off the inside surface of the dropout to make space and gluing a steel plate in place, just because steel is harder than JBWeld. If you have access to basic metalworking tools and advice that's probably a better idea. Gluing steel to aluminium can be done, but use a specialist adhesive rather than generic "superglue". I think your best bet is the aluminium welding solution. Remember that the seat stays are thin-wall hollow tubes and discourage the guy from welding to them, maybe focus just on bulking up the dropout. I'm not an aluminium-working guy, so I'm just suggesting that because I've seen some pretty ugly "add lots of metal" fixes that break because they're transferring stress to places that are not designed for it. 

I suspect you're exactly wrong, unfortunately. The caliper is held in place by the nut at the front - on the opposite side of the brake bridge to the bulk of the caliper. What you've removed is the nut that holds the whole assembly together (or at least one of the nuts). 

The no-compromises approach would be a velomobile, possibly with power assist. The Trisled Avatar is designed to go 50kph/30mph using 200W from the rider. Other velomobiles give similar numbers, especially if you pay extra for the fast versions. If you're fit enough to consider riding 90 miles a day, every day you should be able to exceed that fairly easily. That would cut your commute time without compromising your body the way staying in a time trial tuck for 90 minutes would. I believe someone in the USA is doing a 30 mile each way commute in an Avatar. (full disclosure: the Trisled factory owner is a friend of mine). Trisled don't support electric assist, but there are other fast velomobiles that do. The eWAW is one, but their focus is on helping with stop-start riding so you'd have to talk to them about getting better top speed on long rides. The Avatar is about $15,000 in the USA, the eWAW starts at about 7,000 Euro(google docs link, in Dutch) but I think the electric version is 8,500 Euro. 

In my experience there is always some air loss when you remove the pump from a Presta valve, but that air is lost from the pump side of the valve. It's easier to see with a floor pump, since there's the hose to hold air. In a floor pump there's a check valve is at the pump end of that hose, and that will hold the air in the hose at high pressure even after you let go of the pump handle. That high pressure air escapes when you release the valve. With a handheld pump there should be much less air released when you pull it off, because there's probably no check valve - the path from the pump chamber to the tyre is so short it's not necessary. Because it's so short there's not a lot of volume to hold high pressure air. Even if you release the pump from the valve while holding the pump handle in, you'll hear a little "phut" as the air escapes rather than the long "pssshhh" from a floor pump. But usually you let go of the handle, it gets pushed out a little until there's not enough air pressure to push it further, and when you pop the handheld pump off the valve you don't hear anything. 

You can get parts to fix this, like the helicoil that work by cutting a new, larger thread into the crank then adding a spacer to bring it back to the correct size. They parts are relatively cheap, but the tool to cut the new thread is expensive. Which means that if you can find a bike shop with the tools it's going to cost quite a bit to have them do the work. It's almost always going to be cheaper to simply find a second hand crank that fits, or if that fails buy a new crank. As far as the rest of the tools, it might be worth buying a cheap bicycle tool kit rather than buying one tool at a time or travelling long distances to a bike shop. There are a number of specialised tools needed if you you're going to completely strip down a bike, and buying them one at a time adds up. My suggestion is buy the cheap-but-reasonable-quality set, then as you wear out the tools replace them with decent ones. That way the tools you barely use or where the cheap tool works well enough never get replaced.
