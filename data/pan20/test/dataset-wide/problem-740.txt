Even if someone had a magic database of actual versus nominal sizes for tires, they would need to know what tires you have now and their actual inflated size on your rims to answer. The best answer is yes, probably there is a nominally 700x32 tire out there that's smaller inflated than what you've got. But, two issues there: tire manufacturers have gotten much, much better than they used to be about accuracy in size labeling, so finding that tire would now be a challenge. Secondly, manufacturers often correct badly size-labeled tires pretty readily, so even if there were a good recommendation out there, it would be a bad question for an SE site since it would be a product recommendation that's highly subject to change. A better approach may be just get an accurately sized 700x30, which is an existent albeit not super common size. 

Cheap 14-34 Shimano 6spd freewheels are still being made. As for freehub body swapping, there are a couple things at play. One is the compatibility issues with swapping freehubs at all, and the second is issues related to hub spacing, axle spacing, and wheel dishing with making the swap in question if it is possible. Across manufacturers, there is no real freehub swap compatibility (barring cases where two different OEMs use the same Joytech hub etc). Within manufacturers there can be some. Many Shimano hubs use the same spline pattern and dimensions at the interface between shell and freehub body, and can have freehubs interchanged. Many of the common 8/9/10 Shimano freehub bodies are very close to dimensionally the same. (One sticky point here is that they can look dimensionally identical but usually need their cone/dust seal/spacers etc to be that of the hub they came from. You should assume that's the case unless you want to play games making it work right.) That said, there are a couple exceptions to this within Shimano (completely different shell/freehub body interfaces), and 7 speed hubs are where at least one I know of can be found. So even if both freehubs in question are Shimano, it depends on the specific hubs models. Secondly, if both are interchangeable Shimano freehub bodies, 7-speed freehub bodies are shorter, so to get the spacing back to where you started on the MTB wheel you'll have to add spacers on the left side and then re-dish the wheel. (I recommend doing it this way, because then you get more total spoke tension. You don't get all the strength benefits of a 7-speed hub because it will still have the flange spacing of an 8-speed hub.) And then on the folder hub, you'll need a longer axle. Also I should note that just respacing the folder's existing rear wheel to 7-speed, swapping axles if needed, and then redishing it is another possible course here. 

It's not good but it's a fairly common problem and there's nothing you can really do about it short of replacement. Shimano doesn't sell replacement caliper internal parts or rebuild kits. Oil there is capable of getting worked on to the pads or rotor, possibly causing sudden loss of braking power. Pistons getting extended too far is something that should only happen by accident when the wheel is out. If it leaked some oil then and only then, that's not something to be alarmed about. Likewise, if it only leaks immediately following a bleed, or it had some leakage there when new but not again, that's annoying and not something it "should" do, but probably (and only probably) not an indication of bigger or imminent problems. If it does it all the time in normal use, I'd recommend replacement. 

The picture makes it appear you stuck a BB386EVO crank into a BB30/PF30 bottom bracket without BB386 adapters: 

A really good question and one that a pro in the bike painting/PC business would be best suited to answer, but this is what I know about it: 

There are two things that occur to me. One is easy, which is buy one of the 11-40 9spd cassettes made by Sunrace or IRD. Then, after making sure your RD has the total capacity (it's 45t for RD-M4000, so you're seeing if the [large cog - small cog]+[large ring - small ring] number is equal or less than 45) number required, you'll need to drop it down a little bit by either jacking in the b-tension screw, installing it in reverse and/or installing a longer one, or if needed using a derailer hanger extender, but I'm not exactly sure which one because none of them are made with this exact purpose in mind. (Usually the longer screw is enough in my experience when playing these kinds of tricks, but only usually.) The other idea is you could use one of the 42t cogs made for 10 speed and attempt to make the spacing play nice with 9 speed by using .4mm worth of shim spacers to adapt the 3.95 10spd pitch to 4.35mm 9spd. I haven't done this but I don't see a reason it wouldn't work. Using 9 cogs off a 10-speed cassette isn't how this works, because the pitch will be wrong. What else may be possible, and this is speculative, is starting with a fully non-spidered 10-speed 11-42 cassette, meaning where all the cogs are individual and there are spacers in between each cog, and replacing those spacers with appropriate width ones. A bunch of different companies have made various cassette conversion spacers that work on this principle. You may even be able to harvest some off a spent 9spd cassette. As long as you can get the cog to cog spacing to be 4.35, it should index. 

This borders on an overly opinion-based question. It's also worth pointing out that while there are a lot of bikes with real chaincases in the world, they are pretty far outside of many people's experience. Full, traditional chaincases are fantastic and do everything you want except simple flat fixes. They often fail pretty hard at that, especially when paired with a modern IGH, where the cable comes at the hub in a manner far less convenient for the purpose of a chaincase than going into the end of the axle like an old AW hub for example. They can go together different ways in the dropout/crank access areas, but generally speaking if you're someone of the mind that you want to deal with as little stuff as possible when you get a flat, they are going to give you some stuff to deal with that you'd rather not. They play very nice with extra-flat-resistant tires, Marathon Pluses being the archetypal one these days, but then that's going against the goal of low weight a bit. I would highly recommend you get it fabricated by a bike framebuilder or other shop that does bike-oriented fabrication work. Someone who's not as enamored with the concept as you are and/or who doesn't know bikes will have many, many things they can get wrong. Chaincases have a lot going on. Also you'll have to be very particular about what crank and of course ring size you use. Clearing the crank, including after the bumps and jostles of real world conditions, while also sealing well is one of the major design challenges of chaincases, and always winds up being the troublesome part of doing major/refurb type work on bikes with them. If you're getting it fabricated I would highly recommend leaving the choice of what crank to use to the fabricator. The gear range is a personal question and it of course depends on how much you're willing to lop off the high end, which mountains, how much you're carrying, etc. Generally speaking, yes an Alfine 11 can give you access to the kind of gearing most people would need for touring. It's good to play with a gearing calculator when figuring this kind of thing out. The more modern approach of course is use a belt drive. Personally I think chaincases are way sweeter, by virtue of being 100 year old technology that keeps your drivetrain going with very little maintenance, but in all fairness belt drive does do a lot of what you're after here, and because it's all off the shelf parts would be way, way cheaper presuming you're working with a frame that's set up for it. They're also much lighter and all the parts involved will be just an order away, as opposed to having something custom going on. 

Cranks are never e-type specific. Some frames dictate you use an e-type FD and BB. You're free to use whatever normal square taper BB. 

For maintenance and reliability, you can probably rank them in approximate order of the White freewheels being best at everything, then the premium singlespeed cassette hubs (King, Profile), then after that I'd put the nicer BMX freewheels, then the nicer generic-brand singlespeed cassette hubs (Novatec), then the junkier singlespeed cassette hubs, then the cheap BMX freewheels. It's all opinion based but that's my experience being around all that stuff. Note that rate of engagement is a major distinguishing factor between the options (kind of the major one as far as a lot of riders are concerned), but it doesn't really follow the above order because there are some pretty nice freewheels in terms of construction with pretty bad ROE, and likewise there are any number of junky, gimmicky freewheels and cassette hubs with high ROE and bad durability. Generally speaking, non-BMX singlespeed cassette hubs come in 130mm or 135mm, not the "trackier" 120mm, and won't be able to be respaced to 120mm because if it's well-designed then its flange-to-flange spacing will preclude that. There are BMX race cassette hubs that can be respaced up to 120 (from 110), and I'm under the impression that the Profile 120mm cassette hubs, which is the main off the shelf one that exists, are essentially a manufacturer-provided version of such a hack, but there's downside there that because the flange-to-flange was designed around a 110mm hub, you're sort of giving up strength for no reason if you space the hub 120. I'm just going to flagrantly disregard SE rules here because the really good products in this category don't change much over time, and say that if you really want durability and reliability here you should take your pick between White, Profile, and King and call it good. 

Sorry your stuff got stolen :/. For wheels you need basically any hybrid rim brake wheelset with standard 135mm spacing and an 8/9/10 speed rear hub. That's most non-disc hybrid wheels out there that you'll find, as well as disc sets with non-disc-specific rims. Good deals on sets can be often be had online and at shops; that's generally what you should look for if you're trying to save money. For example, here in the US when I'm working with someone in your situation, the first thing I do is look at sets on sale at the major wheel wholesalers. There's a backstory there; that whole side of the industry has a fascination with getting complete wheelset sales, and they often overproduce and wind up slashing prices later. The hub you link to is one such compatible hub of many. For the cassette, that one is a drop-in replacement for the original one, or you could take the opportunity to go to a lower or higher low gear if you wanted. (You could go to 11-34 with your derailers and cranks, but you may need a longer chain. But, a new chain is a good idea with a new cassette anyway to avoid skipping and premature wear.) That post should also be a drop in replacement for what came on the bike. 

It's a little bit wrong in that it has zero upside and one potential downside, but that downside is unlikely to ever be relevant. Trailing spokes straighten a little temporarily under drive load, and this causes the spokes to essentially be pushing on each other a little at the cross. On a wheel laced like this (there's no agreed upon term for it but let's call it "asymmetric"), the idea exists that the forces from the spokes pushing on each other in this way add together and can cause the rim to get pulled over to one side slightly in use, whereas with mirror-image lacing the forces would cancel each other out, or come closer to it. This is probably a real thing that happens, but it doesn't really make any difference I've ever seen, and we're talking about a very small amount of movement in the rim. If there were consequences, it would probably be on a bike with tight tire clearance. Some wheel manufacturers make all their wheels this way, because it can save steps and/or simplify their procedures. The more potentially consequential side to rebuilding a wheel this way is that double-grooving the flanges increases the risk of flange failure and increases the amount of work you have to do to get the spokes bedded into the flanges. So barring situations where you're forced to use a different lacing pattern on the same hub, or where you're switching to a rim of different "handedness" than the old one (only really something you'll see if vintage parts are involved AFAIK), there is zero reason to not re-use the existing grooves. (Note that this is not to say that flange failure is at all likely from double-grooving a tangentially laced wheel, just that the odds of it happening go up.) If the wheel was built asymmetrically originally, it should usually be re-laced this way. 

That there's some amount of play you can feel through the black plastic shield in one of the bearings with the cranks out isn't necessarily a big deal. What you're looking for is the quality of the adjustment you can get out of it with the cranks on. If you're forced to either have it grindy/frictiony or have play or both at the same time, that's a BB that needs replaced. Broadly speaking, yes you seem to be wearing them out on the fast side. Your description of the issues you're having somewhat suggests not enough care given to keeping the bearing adjusted. You shouldn't have to mess with it all the time, but every once in a while on a Shimano outboard BB to be sure. You're trying to always keep it slightly preloaded. Another way of saying it is as loose as possible but with no play. Too little or too much preload will trash the bearings. Chronically running through these BBs, especially despite ones best efforts with adjustment, can also suggest a shell that needs facing and chasing to get better bearing alignment. Outboard BBs, the cheaper ones in particular, really aren't all that durable compared to high quality square taper cartridge BBs. I have a BB-UN72, Shimano's nice but modestly priced upper end square taper unit, with thousands of miles on it in all weather conditions and over 10 years old that's still utterly perfect. No outboard BBs do that that I'm aware of. If you're doing high mileage touring then just getting a King or Phil along with making sure the shell is well-prepped would probably make some sense. What kind of mileage you get still depends on you and the conditions you ride in, but they are more robust. I'm also a big fan of the Enduro replacement bearing kits for Shimano outboard BBs, because they replace the bearing with a larger and more durable cartridge by getting rid of the black top hat seal and putting a different kind of seal in its place, but the catch with them is you more or less need a special tool to install them into the cups. I've observed them be a good solution for folks having trouble with tearing through BBs though.
