You might be interested in the Deformation Theoretic content of this. For the commutative algebra version the construction is in S. LICHTENBAUM AND M. SCHLESSINGER, The cotangent complex of a morphism, Trans. Amer. Math. Sot. 128 (1967), 41-70, and shortly afterwards Quillen used this to discuss cohomology in his paper: D. QUILLEN, On the homology of commutative rings, Proc. Sympos. Pure Marh. 17 (1970), 65-87. Quillen ascribes the idea to Beck. Following up the cotangent complex idea takes one through Grothendieck's cofibred categories and Illusie's thesis, which may link up with your later questions. The idea is also known as Idealisation as it turns a (bi)module over an algebra into an ideal of another algebra. There is also a very general theory of split epimorphisms in semi-abelian categories (or similar) that describe this process in great generality. (I can give some references for that if needs be, just ask.) I seem to recall that in non-commutative geometry this construction has been used but that is out of my comfort zone! 

(I only just saw this one year on!) I find your question very strange. Grothendieck gives a simple categorical formulation of a situation that encompasses the three main examples of Galois theoretic machines. That means he shows what makes things really tick... isn't that good enough for you! He does this with the clearly stated aim of developing a fundamental group for schemes, and the theory gives that and a lot more. If you go to the slightly wider results on the fundamental groupoid of categories of locally finite sheaves, that is a first step towards his Pursuing Stacks, the letters to Larry Breen, and enroute for his Longue Marche. In another direction it provides a first step towards the Joyal-Tierney theory of locales etc. and their relation with toposes. It provides a background for all of Jacob Lurie's work on higher toposes, and I could go on with fundamental groups of toposes, homotopy theory of toposes. SGA1 is the key for understanding a large part of modern mathematics. Grothendieck's methodology was always to seek the clarity that came from abstraction and generalisation. His aim was not only to solve problems (say in algebraic geometry) but to understand as fully as possible their solution and why they worked. 

Perhaps as an algebraic geometer, you might read his paper:On the (co-)homology of commutative rings , in Proc. Symp. on Categorical Algebra , (1970), 65–87, American Math. Soc. This is fairly short and yet is one of the key papers in the area. It introduces ideas of homotopical algebra, which have been crucial in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, yet the paper does not need a whole load of prior knowledge. The lecture notes on homotopical algebra and the paper on rational homotopy theory are beautiful in their use of techniques from adjacent areas to solve hard general problems and follow on from that initial work. The algebraic K-theory papers are another thread, but these have been mentioned above. 

Another extensive use of the holomorph is in the study of crossed modules / 2-groups (in the categorification sense). Any group yields a one object groupoid. Any groupoid $G$ yields an endomorphism gadget $G^G$, that is the category of functors from $G$ to itself. This is at one and the same time a groupoid and a monoid (under composition of functors). Now look at the functors that are isomorphisms. That gives you a category which is also a group. (Yes I do mean that! It is the subgroup of the monoid structure.) That makes it a 2-group in that categorified sense. Any 2-group yield a crossed module and the crossed module here is just the inner automorphism homomorphism $G\to Aut(G)$. The 2-group is the holomorph! This basic construction is central to many treatments of non-Abelian cohomology (of groups, and of sheaves of groups.) See Larry Breen's papers, and more recently papers by Aldrovandi and Noohi. (You can find stuff on this in the n-Lab and also in my Menagerie notes, a version of which is on my n-Lab homepage.) It is also central to attempts to implement Grothendieck's Pursuing Stack programme although that needs an enormous amount more input as well! (I can give detailed references if they are of interest.) 

There are several programs that answer to your first demand whilst the others, as Ryan says, are a bit more vague. There are books written on computational homology (and its applications) for instance, see $URL$ and the computational homology project. For simplicial complexes, the Plex routines written for Matlab are at $URL$ and that leads to a lot of other interesting programs for which see $URL$ and follow links. The main problems are always speed of computing with large simplicial complexes. (Work by Edelsbrunner and collaborators is good for some of this.) For homotopy colimits, it seems likely that the only programs that might go some way are related to Kenzo project: see $URL$ but that is more difficult to use. There are programs for detecting (small) handles used in computer graphics, but I cannot say anything about them. 

I have tried a method with a combinatorial group theory class, which is first to look at the universal quotient property relative to equivalence relations on a set. You explore this idea, and show that the set of equivalence classes is the answer you want and you derive the `first iso theorem' in that context. Exploring it to death if you like, with trivial do-able examples and constructions that students know. (e.g. different pairs (a,b) of integers giving the same rational numbers etc.) A function defines an equivalence relation and the equivalence relation defines a function and they are related. NB. no algebra at all in sight. This is strictly constructions on sets and functions. The idea of the universal property is now centre stage i.e. where it should be. You can now ask if something similar is going to happen for groups and homomorphisms. The point is that it is not dividing out by a (normal) subgroup that is at stake here but by an equivalence relation (and that will not work of course). Equivalence relations seem to be more basic perhaps. We all know the problem and the answer but the student has then something nearer to their previous experience. The equivalence relation does not work since although the quotient does seem to have an 'obvious' multiplication, that does not work and simple examples show it not to be well-defined (NB. 'Well definition' is a simple concept but students can (and do) find it very hard to grasp. This way, it is met as 'ill definition' first. The notion of well definition is perhaps not understood because it is usually presented as being a solution to a problem that the student has not ever met themselves.) You now examine what goes wrong and get to the idea that you need a congruence not simply an equivalence relation. (Here I have used a categorical approach without the use of the term category, and really looked as a congruence as being an equivalence relation 'internal' to the category of groups... and no need to mention categories unless you feel like it. You can make the transition from equivalence relation to congruence in any way that seems appropriate for the background of the students.) This is the hard bit, not cosets, and it is hard, but sort of avoided in the usual treatment. Now normal subgroups can be shown to be a reformulation of congruences and you can flip from one to the other and back again with no loss of info. I like this treatment as the cosets only appear at the last moment, and then are the group theory analogue of equivalence classes. (If we have not got those across before we do cosets then there is no hope!) This treatment also concentrates on the algebraic details that really need understanding. I do not mean group theory details as they are more specialised. We have equivalence classes, well definition and a universal property, three big ideas. Normal subgroups come out as being natural. Did this approach work? Not all the students could handle the idea of cosets, but they did seem happier with equivalence classes, well definition etc, and also seemed to like the universal property idea, which they met in various other contexts (product groups, free product, free group, etc.) in that course. 

A lot of maths (and related stats) goes into the development of techniques for screening in the detection of breast cancer using mamography. (I know of this from work by Reyer Zwiggelaar in Aberystwyth. He is in a computer science department but uses a lot of deep maths.) 

Some years ago I taught some homotopy coherence theory mentioning quasi-categories, etc in a Masters course on cohomology in Ottawa, and then used the material from that in several graduate level mini-courses at conferences. The course used crossed modules etc. and was not as detailed on Higher Algebra as perhaps you are meaning. I wrote up the notes and then extended them adding in material for the mini-courses as I went and filling in background. Anyone is welcome to have a look and to use the notes . The notes have got very long in their current form but I have another copy available on my n-lab page at: $URL$ Other forms of the notes are available although none fits exactly the original questioner's requirements. They have been used on several occasions with moderate success. Have a look at the other notes that are linked to from my n-Lab page: $URL$ as they may have some material that is usable. That deals with available material. Prior to that(<2006) we taught numerous masters level courses at Bangor (when there was still a Maths Dept there) which incorporated material on crossed modules, crossed complexes, their infinity groupoid interpretations, etc. and their use in non-Abelian cohomology and homological algebra. The links with various variants of infinity category theory were explored in those courses. 

There is a newish emerging area, `applied algebraic topology'. It includes Topological Data Analysis (see work by Gunnar Carlsson and others). There is also new work again in Applied Algebraic Topology looking at Configuration spaces and probablity theory. Look for research assistant jobs at Post Doc level on specific topics in applied geometry and topology. There is also an ESF programme ($URL$ that gives some idea of what may be available. Some of this would provide a half way house between where you are and where you want to be! Good Luck. (Soon there is s summer school in Slovenia on these areas. Look at the program schedule and you may get some ideas on who to contact to see what they think, whetehr there are any positions coming up, short visits are a good way to start if they have money for such and seem interested. I think there is quite a good chance and all of this area is growing fast so it could be very interesting to get into it at the moment. (The topic of big data is even hitting the newspapers, and that forms part of this.) 

The point is that you may be asking the 'wrong' question. The use of paths is inappropriate in this algebraic geometric context, and hence also ideas such as 'path connected' and 'fundmental group(oid)'although there are analogues. The classical fundamental group classifies covering spaces of $X$, and that is a useful property to generalise. Look at Grothendieck's SGA1 (if you can read French) for the original material on this, but there are lots of more recent sources 'out there' (including some well written surveys, some done by various Masters students, that are a good read and get you to the point fairly quickly without a lot of generality! One such that I have used is 'M. A. D. Robalo, 2009, Galois Theory towards Dessins d’Enfants, Master’s thesis, Instituto Superior Technico, Lisboa'. Another very good source is by Dubuc and de la Vega, (and which can be found on the ArXiv as math.CT/0009145.) There are analogues of the fundamental groupoid and of covering spaces and then you can ask if the fundamental groupoid is connected (corresponding to path connectedness in the classical topological case) That fundemantal groupoid is usually thought of as a profinite groupoid, and that may encode the topological information that you are hoping for in the second part of the question. (I should add that it is best to consider general schemes with the étale topology, but to start with that may not be necessary.) I hope this helps. 

Where to direct you to learn about pro-objects depends on how general a form you need and, to some extent, your background. If you look at inverse systems/sequences of modules (as in the case you cite), then look at the nLab entry on towers, and also on profinite groups. Pro-objects provide a sense of approximation to a limit object that may not be in the category you are looking at, e.g. a pro-finite group is an inverse system of finite groups. If you take its limit the result will often not be a finite group. The finite quotients of a group form a profinite group in this sense. There is also a topological approach which comes in in your pro-A-module setting as well. Nice systems of cofinite submodules will form a pro-module in an analogous way. I wrote an introduction to pro-objects (in general) in a set of notes available via my nLab page: $URL$ You only need the first few pages of the main text, although you may find some useful ideas later on in the first chapter. The definition of morphism in a procategory can possibly be best understood by looking at pro-representable functors. Left exact functors will be pro-representable (check again on the nlab for the definition) and natural transformations between pro-representable functors give exactly that definition of pro-morphism. An approach that will perhaps help you understand Bhatt's second statement is to work when a pro-module (in general) will be isomorphic to a zero pro-module.(Some ideas relating to this can be found in a book by Cordier and myself that you may find answers some of the basic points, see the nLab page on pro-objects for the details of the book. There are also some old notes of Duskin based on ideas of Verdier, who wrote a note J.-L. Verdier, Équivalence essentielle des syst`emes projectifs, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 261, (1965), 4950–4953.) 

It may help to look at some of the papers of Ronnie Brown for the last part, and I would also mention two papers by Ronnie Brown, Marek, Golasinski, myself, and Andy Tonks,Spaces of maps into classifying spaces for equivariant crossed complexes, that interprets a similar problem in the case of $G$-equivariant maps where $G$ is either discrete or in the second paper is a general topological group. 

Without answering your question directly, you may be interested in the paper: Multiple semidirect products of associative systems. Richard Steiner. Glasgow Mathematical Journal - GLASGOW MATH J 01/1989; 31(03). Some of the questions you pose also are discussed in, and are relevant to, work on $cat^n$-groups in homotopy theory. Taking $cat^2$ groups (or equivalently crossed squares) in the sense of Loday, a simple example is a group $G$ together with two specified normal subgroups, $M$ and $N$, (together with their intersection). The commutator between the two normal subgroups yields a map $h: M\times N \to M\cap N$. (Abstracting this a crossed square has crossed modules, $M\to G$, $N\to G$ and then replacing $M\cap N$ by a more general $L$, two more crossed modules $L\to M$, $L\to N$ and an $h$-map, mimicking the earlier examples. From this set up one constructs a `big group' $(L\rtimes M)\rtimes (N\rtimes G)$ unambigously, i.e. you get an isomorphic group if you work out $(L\rtimes N)\rtimes (M\rtimes G)$. This may seem distant from your specific question but the point is that the axioms of the h-map in a crossed square, encode the compatibility of the actions. This is related to your diagram espeically when $C$ is a central subgroup. Another useful source may be papers on the non-Abelian tensor products of groups, starting probably with: R. Brown, D. L. Johnson and E. F. Robertson, Some computations of non-abelian tensor products of groups, J. Algebra, 111, (1987), 177 – 202. Here again questions of the compatibility of the actions is central to the constructions. 

I have been doing what I consider to be higher category theory since the 1970s. It went under the name of homotopy coherence theory and so was thought of as homotopy theory. I used Kan complexes etc.Which is it? The distinction is TOTALLY ARTIFICIAL so, Chris, I do rather object to setting up strange barriers between different areas of pure mathematics as this question requires. That was more a comment, here is an answer: Ronnie Brown and Phil Higgins' work on higher dimensional groupoids is a natural continuation of J. H. C. Whitehead's Combinatorial Homotopy II. The first of the two papers is where CW-complexes are introduced, so is that algebraic topology. Could RB and PJH have proved their higher van Kampen theorem without using higher dimensional groupoids? Possibly but they didnot!!! They used intuitions and methods from higher dimensional category theory .... including ideas from Grothendieck, Ehresmann, Benabou, Kelly, Street, etc. (The person (not you, Chris) who asked the question is blinkered if they think that mathematics divides up neatly into bits of independent subject areas with no interaction.)
