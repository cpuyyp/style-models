Word are created in response to need. There are only two planets on which we have any significant presence on the surface: Earth and Mars. When running operations on Mars, the day/night cycle is significant, so a word was needed for the length of this cycle. Especially since the sol is so close to the day, there is greater potential for confusion. Other planets either have very long rotation periods or no solid surface. On, for example, Mercury you can use "day" until there is a need for a new term. 

The time between oppositions of Mars (or another planet) is called its synodic period. That is the length of time it takes for Mars to be in the same position in Earth's sky relative to the sun, and is about 780 days. It contrasts with the sidereal period, which is the length of time the planet takes to orbit the sun. There isn't a fixed number of days between conjunctions, so I don't think this has a name. 

There is no theoretical maximum. It would be possible for the solar system to orbit a sufficiently large mass, (while the planets' orbits remain stable). And it would be possible for that large mass to orbit another, even larger mass. The process could, in theory, be repeated without limit. The masses of the central bodies would have to be exponentially larger with each embedding, and so could not be conventional stars, beyond a certain point. (They could be black holes) This is the absence of theoretical limit imposed by the theory of gravitation. In practice, multiple levels of orbits don't exist, since there does not exist a mechanism that can create the massive central bodies in the right orbits. 

(image from University of Wisconsin) I remember 1986, and the comet was visible but hard to see. It was a very dim fuzzy dot, that was just about visible in my binoculars. This is because, unfortunately, the Earth was a long way from the comet. In 2061 Earth will be even further from the comet, however Earth will be better positioned when Halley is closest to the sun, so it should make a good show, and be clearly visible to the naked eye. Comet predictions are hard as much depends on exactly how much water vapour boils off, and this is hard to predict. Comets can have sudden changes in activity. Moreover, Halley's comet isn't the only comet. There are others that can be as visible as Halley will be in 2061. There are also long period comets that are undiscovered until they come close to the sun. These can be very bright. Comet Hale-Bopp was a "great" comet in 1997 and was visible for many months. Another great comet could come along any time but we can't predict when. 

Halley's comet orbits the sun and its orbit lasts 75 years. The orbit is a long elliptical orbit. For most of those 75 years it is a cold black dot, and frozen solid in the outer solar system. But a short period during that orbit it gets close to the sun. The ice and gas begin to boil of its surface and gets blown back by the solar wind of the sun. It then starts to look like a comet. The last time Halley's comet was close to the sun was in 1986, and so the next time will be in 2061. You won't be able to see Halley's comet until then. 

Being struck by a piece of rock that is pebble sized or bigger could do damage to any base. Fortunately such objects are rare. Their danger could not be entirely avoided, but would be just part of the overall risk of such a mission. Micrometeorites would hit any exposed base, just as they have hit the ISS and the space shuttle in the past. The base would be make strong enough to survive very small impacts. The base could be built partially underground, which would also reduce cosmic radiation. And in would be possible to isolate parts of the base, so a breach doesn't cause destruction of the entire base. Finally, astronauts have to accept dangers that most people would find intolerable. The ISS was estimated to have a 5% chance of catastrophic failure over its lifespan. 4% of astronauts have died in a spacecraft. Breach due to micrometeorite impact would be one of the many risks. 

Galaxies give off a range of frequencies of light: Visible, but also infrared, microwave, and radiowaves. at longer wavelengths, ultraviolet, Xrays and gamma rays at short wavelengths. But stars give off quite a lot of their radiation in visible light, so nearby galaxies are quite bright in visible light and rather less bright in Ultraviolet. Very distant galaxies are moving away from us due to the general expansion of the galaxy. This means that the light is stretched. Visible light gets stretched to infra-red, ultraviolet gets stretched to visible light. The distant galaxy is very very far away, and so very dim. It is a little bit brighter in infrared, although there is also a little visible light (and other wavelengths too) Galaxies never go completely invisible in visible light, even if they are red-shifted, because there is always ultraviolet light to red-shift to visible. The specific limit is often taken to be 700nm as the boundary between red and infrared. Although this is fuzzy because some people can see a little further than others. 

As New Horizons past through the Pluto system, it travelled so that the spacecraft was on the far side of Pluto, as seen from Charon. It did this so both Pluto and Charon were roughly in the same direction, so the space craft would not have to rotate 180 degrees between imaging Pluto to imaging Charon. It means that in images of Charon, the face that you can see is roughly the face that faces Pluto, However the it is the far side of Pluto (the side with the "whale" and the "dots" that faces Charon. Tidal locking is pretty stable. See our own moon: it is locked, and has been for a long time. There is likely to be some wobble, just like the libations of the moon, but no overall rotation of either Pluto or Charon. 

It is not exactly the same each year. The exact moment of winter solstice is not at the same calendar date (because of leap days for example). In 2017 the solstice was at Dec 21 16:22, and in 2016 it was Dec 21 10:33. See also 22nd is shortest day in some places, but the 21st is shortest in other places. Can this be true? So there is a little variation in the length of the shortest day, but the length of the day changes slowly at this time of year, so the range of variation is only a few seconds. 

Yes, in theory. But; No, this is very unlikely to happen during the life of the sun. If it did happen it would be Bad. Many black holes are much more massive than the sun, even though they are much smaller. If a black hole were to enter the sun, some the matter that forms the sun would form into a accretion disc around the black hole and eventually fall into the black hole. The rest of the sun would be utterly disrupted by the massive release of energy as matter falls towards the black hole. The solar system would be wrecked. The Earth, even if it survived intact, would not be able to support life. Fortunately black holes are rare, and space is BIG. The chances of a black hole coming anywhere near the sun in the next billion years or so is very very small. There are more pressing things to worry about.
