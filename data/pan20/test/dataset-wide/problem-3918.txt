I think Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley is what you're looking for. It contains all of the topics you're asking about (except maybe spectral theory), and I feel it does a good job introducing the world of probability to the reader without assuming you already understand it, which Durrett's book tends to do. 

It's not a movie, but the creator of the show Futurama is a computer scientist and one of the writers is a mathematician. It has quite a bit of mathematics in it, and a new combinatorics result was even proven to resolve the plot of the episode "The Prisoner of Benda"! $URL$ Here is a website devoted to the mathematics of Futurama: $URL$ In case you can't tell, I like Futurama. 

Suppose I have a discrete-time Markov Chain (in an infinite dimensional state space $\Omega$) with Markov operator $P$, a linear operator on the space of bounded measurable functions on $\Omega$. (Or possibly some Banach space of functions, like Lipschitz functions) And suppose an invariant measure $\mu$ exists on $\Omega$, i.e., a measure such that for any bounded measurable function $g$ on $\Omega$, we have $$ \int_\Omega Pg \; \mathrm d \mu = \int_\Omega g \; \mathrm d \mu. $$ My general question is the following: 

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A},P)$ be a probability space, and let $(\mathcal{F}_k)_{k \geq 1}$ be a filtration which converges to $\mathcal{A}$. I suppose it is true that $$ E \left( \big(E \left( X | \mathcal{F}_k \right) \big)^2 \right) \to E \left(X^2 \right). $$ How to prove this? I guess one will need Jensen's inequality and a convergence theorem for submartingales, but cannot find the right reference (I am working on number theory, not probability). (If you know an answer, please also provide a citable reference.) 

What is a good upper bound for the maximal cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$? In words, what I am looking for is a version of Sauer's lemma under the additional assumption that not all possible sets obtained by intersection are counted, but only those which are "separated" in the sense of the symmetric difference being not too small. (Sauer's lemma is the special case $m=1$.) The application which I have in mind requires $m \approx \varepsilon n$ for some small $\varepsilon$, but I think it is in general an interesting question. 

A finite version of your sum can be written in the form $\sum_{q=1}^Q \frac{1}{q} h(q x)$, where $h(x)$ is the function $\min(x,1-x)$, extended with period 1. The average of this function is $1/4$, so you should expect the sum of the first $Q$ summands to be of size roughly $(\log Q)/4$. Thus your question is more interesting if your subtract the mean 1/4 from your function h, and probably normalize the sum by an appropriate factor (depending on $Q$). The solution will have something to do with the so-called discrepancy of the sequence $(q \alpha)_{q \geq 1}$, and the so-called Koksma inequality should be a helpful tool. For the whole theory around this (called uniform distribution theory and discrepancy theory), check the book of Kuipers-Niederreiter. 

The lamplighter group, defined as the wreath product $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, is amenable yet has exponential growth. It can be thought of as a bi-infinite sequence of street lamps, each of which can be turned on and off, and a lamplighter who moves along the sequence. The three generators of the group are to move the lamplighter right or left, and to switch the state of the lamp he is positioned in front of. With this picture in mind, it is easy to show the group has exponential growth. 

I've been reading Kato's book on Perturbation Theory, but there is no mention of measures. I also realize that you may need quite a bit more knowledge of $P$ to say anything conclusive, perhaps that it is self-adjoint on some Hilbert Space, etc... Just mention whatever assumptions are necessary when answering. I would also appreciate any references that may be helpful. This is a vague, open-ended question, so perhaps it should be a community wiki. Please comment if you think it should be and I can change it. 

It's well known that information about the spectrum of $P$ can give information about convergence of the chain to $\mu$ (namely via the spectral gap and Markov mixing times), but what about the structure of $\mu$ itself? For example, if I know that $P$ can be written as a small $\epsilon$ perturbation of another operator, i.e., $P = P(\epsilon) = P_0 + \epsilon P_1$ with invariant measure $\mu(\epsilon)$, and I know that for all $\epsilon$ small enough, I know something about the spectrum of $P(\epsilon)$ (like perhaps that its essential spectrum is bounded away from $1$), can I determine that, for example, the function $\epsilon \mapsto \int g \; \mathrm d \mu(\epsilon)$ is analytic near $0$, for all bounded measurable $g$? 

It is well-known that the Riemann zeta function can be approximated in the critical strip by a finite Dirichlet polynomial. More precisely, $$ \zeta(\sigma+it) = \sum_{n \leq X} n^{-\sigma-it} + \frac{X^{1-\sigma-it}}{\sigma+it-1} + O ( X^{-\sigma}) $$ uniformly for all $X$ satisfying $2 \pi X / C \geq |t|$, where $C$ is a fixed constant greater than 1. (This is Theorem 4.11 in Titchmarsh's book). In particular this holds for $\sigma = 1/2$. Question: is there a similar (simple) approximation of zeta by a finite Euler product? 

In metric Diophantine approximation you are often interested in finding conditions on $(\phi(q))_{q \geq 1}$ which guarantee that $$ \left| \alpha - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \frac{\phi(q)}{q} $$ has infinitely many integer solutions p,q for almost all $\alpha$. (Often you also assume that $p$ and $q$ must be coprime, but this is not the point in my question). A problem of this type is for example the famous (unsolved) Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture, see $URL$ The problem can also be written in the following form: Let $A_1, A_2, \dots$ be intervals on the torus (of length $\leq 1$), which are symmetric around 0. Let $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ denote the Lebesgue measure (that is, the length) of these intervals. Under which conditions on $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ do we have $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} (n \alpha) = \infty $$ for almost all $\alpha$ (here $\mathbf{1}_A$ is the indicator function of $A$. Also, everything is understood to take place on the torus, so the indicators are extended with period 1.) Now you may generalize the situation in a first step to the case when the intervals $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are not necessarily symmetric around $0$. Then you get a problem in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation. This type of question is also quite well-investigated. Now my question is the following: what happens is if don't assume that $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are intervals, but if they may denote any measurable sets in $[0,1]$. Again, write $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ for the measure of these sets. Under which conditions on $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ do we have $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} (n \alpha) = \infty $$ for almost all $\alpha$? Are there any sufficient conditions? (Note that a necessary condition is the divergence of the sum of the measures, by Borel-Cantelli). Does it help if the sequence $(\psi_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is monotonic? Are there any known results at all about this general problem? (Remark: This question is distantly related to Khintchin's conjecture, which was disproved by Marstrand in 1970. See $URL$ (Remark 2: The sequence $(n \alpha)_{n \geq 1}$ mod 1 has an interpretation in terms of ergodic theory, but I don't think that this will help here.)
