I think it is impossible for a planet to develop only one life form. If we look at earth the entire planet has a sort of balance, where the development of one form life is stopped by another, none of them getting to be fully disruptive. From this balance the competition emerges, and intelligence at some point evolves. Of course once humans evolved and we got very intelligent compared to all other life forms, we got to a point where our population dictates the balance. But absent the competition there is no need for intelligence (which is costly from an evolutionary point of view), so your aliens would not think anything of the actions of humans because they would be unable to think (that if they could evolve like this, but I doubt they could). 

I don't know about anything else, but you would need genetic engineers to modify the humans that land there. Radius twice the size of earth would mean a mass tens of times bigger then Earths (I am to lazy to calculate now), and a gravitational acceleration significantly bigger than Earths. Also, the atmosphere would be very thick, people could not breathe that air. Actually I think that at this mass, the planet would be to heavy to be considered a rocky planet, and it would be a gas giant (a little on at that). As such, the humans could not survive there. But if it would not be a gas giant, if they would first go to the moon, set up there, build up a larger colony and then they would genetically alter themselves they could go on the planet next. So for this genetic manipulation you would need genetic engineers. And there is another problem. Normally you would send a ship with a lot of resources first if you go a short distance like to Mars, then a colony ship with only what is needed for traveling safely. This because you can wait to see that the first ship got there safe, the load was not damaged and the people have the equipment. If it fails you just send another ship with equipment. That way you don't risk the lives of the people with some extra heavy ship in one round. This is what happens with the ISS now, we don't send extra heavy rockets with all that the astronauts would need for the entire period with them, there is a stash there and it is constantly replenished by unmanned missions (which are safer in term of potential human loss). This makes your scenario more improbable, as the ship would not carry enough equipment. You would send such a complete ship only if it goes a long distance (to another system). 

Let's start by assuming a superhuman that isn't limited by biology for obvious reasons. Then let's assume they also receive super toughness to make this work. Their super toughness scales with strength, so that if they are 10x stronger than a human a normal blow will only harm them 1/10 as much as it would harm a normal person. This is more of a tentative rule, if this is inadequate to avoid really anticlimactic solutions then I will totally change it. I'm also assuming other stuff like how many G's they can withstand before blacking out scale the same way. Now the obvious thing I need to know, is if they have something analogous to muscles generating force within their body, how do you calculate how fast they can run and jump? Obviously things don't just scale linearly, a man who can carry a few tons as much probably can't run supersonic, so clearly speed isn't linearly derived from strength. For the purposes of this I will not be considering crazily high end superhero's, nor superhero's barely above human level. I am asking about the consequences of superhuman strength ranging from a lifting a ton, to carrying 10 tons. (metric or imperial your pick). I am working on a setting that involves superhumans, and I want to be able to figure out what combat would actually look like, how fast they should actually be able to move and how high they could jump. By starting with their strength and working to figure out how other abilities are derived from that. I am also assuming that where it matters the super's reflexes are sped up, and their perception of time is slowed down when they are moving fast, so that they can use the resulting pseudo-super speed effectively in combat. The things I want an answer to cover are: Given a particular amount of super strength, from a minimum of lifting a ton to being able to lift 10 tons at maximum, how high will they be able to jump and how fast can they run and otherwise move? How would their movements apply to other movement situations, like moving inside buildings, for instance would you be able to run leaping from wall to wall. Also more generally, how does super strength influence movement capabilities? I can find dozens of sources talking about how super strong punches would work, but next to nothing covering basic extrapolations for movement. For instance, how much of a limiting factor is the strength of surrounding materials to super strength enhanced movement, how much does it limit your ability to jump or run at full strength? How plausible is it for someone with super strength to jump over buildings, or to get to the top of a skyscraper by wall jumping between it and another adjacent skyscraper? How does the ability to rapidly accelerate and decelerate influence melee other than just being able to hit harder? Suffice to say, I think mid tier super strength is probably way more versatile and just different than generally imagined. To be extra clear the only power that matters here is the super strength, (though it also comes with super toughness and somewhat faster reflexes as required secondary powers.) Everything else should just be be about the logical extensions of super strength, specifically how it affects movement. Bonus question: Given the massive force to mass ratio of these superhumans, they could certainly manage human powered flight through any number of means. Elaborate on a method you think would be particularly good. 

Genghis Khan's tomb has not been found. He requested that, so they made a deep hole, placed him in then put back the ground, didn't put any sign and story says that they went with their horses in every direction, trampled earth both while going to the dig site and after finishing the burial going away. And did that so randomly that after time passed it was impossible to trace them back. If you want to keep something hidden, don't put signs saying "don't open this", put it somewhere no one can find it. It is generally a Hollywood go to stupid plot this thing of "warnings from the ancients". When people want to hide something or keep it away, they do just that, they don't make it easy to find and then write "don't look inside". So my question is: is it so important for your plot to have them write something there and so perpetuate a stupid stereotype or you can concentrate your story on the actual building of the tomb and on its secrecy? Because if you don't concentrate on writing useless stuff, you can make it simple by creating a stone prison and then bringing mud and dirt and planting trees and so creating a "natural" looking hill. Like the Chinese did with their pyramids, but in your case it would be an intentionally forgotten, never spoken about place. And the release of this ancient evil can be done by accident (your present time civilization can dig a tunnel there for a highway or whatever). 

While something like a warp drive is a staple of ftl technology in sci-fi, I wonder how this sort of spatial warping would operate on a smaller scale on earth. The idea has occurred to me to have a character with gravity and antigravity powers try to warp distance. This distance warping wouldn't extend more than half a meter from the character's body at most, and at minimum would only be skin-tight. This special warping would bear some resemblance to a alcubierre warp drive, though based on answers I am now informed a natario drive is more plausible. This power can't used to reach anything approaching relativistic speeds, however I wonder how this would work as a form of superspeed. Another detail that needs to be covered is how it works when the character interacts with objects: What happens when the character tries to move a stationary or slow moving object? What about trying to move bullets and other objects that are fast in relation to the hero's actual speed, and are slow compared to the movement of them and other stuff in their warp bubble. (The hero is also a vampire which grants the required secondary powers) How exactly would something like a warp bubble work in a atmosphere at non-relativistic speeds? Could it avoid the collateral damage normal super-speed entails? How would this spatial warping affect the atmosphere that occupies the warped space? What would this power do when the character interacted with objects not in the field: both slow moving objects and stuff like bullets. What would such a power look and sound like, both to the user and bystanders (I'm assuming the hero has super fast perception and some degree of super senses to cope, and can already run ~400 mph without warping space, or otherwise using gravity control). Ultimately I'm really hoping this power will allow things like this scene (except with superspeed that isn't wildly inconsistent) Bonus Question: What other clever uses would you use a gravity control power for, other than the standard and obvious uses. Assume you have all the other powers mentioned as well: Super senses, super toughness/strength and a baseline speed around 400 mph, In addition assume an ability to increase perception speed to a nigh unlimited amounts. Super-reflexes also protect you by immediately ramping up perception speed in response to danger sensed by super senses, effectively one's subconscious is always perceiving things in slow-motion watching for danger. 

I do not see how life would survive the explosion, but depending on how spread the pieces are, a civilization could colonize the remains after they cool down. Problem is that if you take a planet like earth, and destroy it, none of the resulting pieces would be big enough to sustain an atmosphere and life. You could have a very big initial planet (like near the maximum theoretical for a rocky planet) that gets destroyed but the civilization present there goes somewhere else in that star's system and they come back later, when the pieces get together. But it would be millions of years at least in between the event and the return and the parts would resemble a planet and its satellites. Theoretically you could have some binary planets resulting from the initial ones destruction and each may have a few moons, so you could have a complex system, but it would still not be just rocks moving around in an orbit. Also to note that while binary planets are theoretically possible, from what I know there is no such system observed to date. But you are talking about planet sized destructive capacities, so maybe the targeted civilization would also in turn have some planet powerful gravitational changing devices? If so, of course they would still not survive on the planet during the attack, but they might be able to speed up the planet reshaping process, if enough would survive on spaceships, colonies on other planets in the system etc. Gravitationally push the former planets mass together again, or lets say it is spread too much, but they can make pockets of matter compress and such create something like what i wrote before, a binary system with some moons. Bring water from asteroids, remake the atmosphere by taking from other planets in the system etc. 

Now like good munchkins i'm sure you're all thinking of ways this can be exploited, however this system can't generate much in the way of new information. For instance if you try to get it to produce "a really good movie" or a video of a new mathematical proof it doesn't work unless you know the information already or you go through the details. Generally the AI can't create information that your own mind couldn't create in say a dream, the major difference is that the ai creates information so good it is totally indistinguishable from an actual video. 

Well as a given people will still have cryptography. To avoid punishment messages will be hidden using code words and the like, within larger messages that would appear to be about something else. Even if law enforcement had strong suspicion that a message contained a secret message, proving it would be difficult, and maintaining plausible deniability would be easy. Cryptography would have to be done such that it isn't definitely apparent as cryptography. This still isn't that significant, unless the legal system suddenly lowers the standards for a shadow of a doubt quite a lot, proving something is coded when it is intended to not appear to be would be nigh impossible. Cryptography would be pretty similar it would just be slightly inconvenienced. EDIT: What I mentioned is technically stenography not cryptography, anyway stenography will become widespread partially replacing cryptography. 

A ship that would not have a very important component with a lot of redundancy that would awake crew to save it is not plausible. It is just bad planning. Of course you could have automatic ships, but then you would not scout the possible systems with colony ships, you would have drone ships that report info back and the first contact would be with something like that and not a colony ship. A story where humans manage to do in a limited time something that the creators of that ship could not do is not believable if the intended audience is over 10-15 years old and is interested in tech. 

The ship had a critical failure somewhere in the solar system. A vast majority of the on board population was lost to this. The minimum crew is awaken by the ship, they initiate contact with humanity as they need help (manpower and resources). They are generally peaceful but the ship is capable of significant defense. This because if they are not peaceful we are easy pray and if they cant defend at all then they are easy pray and on both cases no standoff for intrigue can be made. You can have a plot conflict between humans who want to help them and cooperate and humans who just want to capture the ship, kill them and take the technology. Sub-plot intrigues can be made with the timing of discovering certain elements, like how many are left, how good the defense is, how opened they are to communication etc. Evolve the story into something where the ship is rebuild, some sort of technological transfer is made, humans join them, maybe in an extended and rebuilt ship that would properly sustain both populations. you can have a sequel with the voyage to the other world and stuff like that. 

For this question I'm assuming a utterly infeasible technological breakthrough suddenly makes wormholes technology possible. However there is a major catch, the 2D "windows" as they're called don't allow through matter or gravitational pull. The "windows" can be opened for about a half a million USD. Once opened these portals stay open indefinitely unless closed. Opening a portal requires a large amount of energy, and the use of expensive and bulky machines on one end of the wormhole, with only a small machine and energy on par with a car battery required on the other end. The portals are flat windows that look like portals, however were you to walk up to one you would pass through it unaffected. The portals size can be as small as a millimeter or as large as 2,600 meters, any larger would require using multiple portal machines and linking them together. A portal can have any shape with the smallest definition being a millimeter, however portals are totally flat. Each side of the flat portal corresponds to a side of the other end of the portal. Each of the two connected portals must be the exact same shape and size. Portals will continue moving as the machine that created them was, at the moment it created the portal, other than controlling its initial motion you can't move portals except as detailed below. This means if the machine was orbiting the earth the portal will continue this motion, even though it isn't itself a object and has no mass. Portals also continue accelerating or decelerating as the machine was when it created it, however while portals can continue accelerating indefinitely they will slow acceleration such that they approach, but never reach the speed of light. A portal on earth will not slowly drift, since slight changes in planetary motion such as the lengthening of days is effectively counted as deceleration thus the portal undergoes the same slowing, this only holds true for motions that continue at the same rate of acceleration/deceleration as when the portal was created. The end of the portal which requires the expensive machinery to create can be kept linked to the machines so that it moves with them, however this means you can't use those machines to make further portals. Weapon note: To prevent the scenario of potential apocalyptic destruction, due to someone launching a portal through the sun. I have decided that a wormhole will collapse if more than about the equivalent of a kiloton of TNT worth of energy tries to pass through it in a second, though most energy that can pass through it in a second is equivalent to a ton of tnt. Since the portal only allows through at most a ton of tnt, any additional energy is reflected back when it hits the portal. This is still a lot of energy so it still has a lot of weapon potential. Keep in mind, as far as I know all energy would be in the form of photons. TLDR: It's a portal that only lets light through.Well actually other details of it are more complicated, so read the whole question before answering. What uses would be implemented for such a technology assuming it essentially appeared in our world overnight? The most obvious thing I can think of using it for is as a source of near infinite energy, you could get one end of the portal in an orbit much closer to the sun and use the energy to boil massive amounts of water (also may be useful for desalinization). Using it to allow faster than light communication is an obvious application as well (though given our current technology that's not super useful). 

Do you actually need it to be very deep underwater? If you just want it to be hard to find, you can place it in remote shallow water (well, not really shallow, but something like 100 meters deep). Somewhere near Greenland, or Antarctica would work, if you want to place it firm on the bottom. It's not like there are millions of scuba divers in these places. It might be better not to complicate the story with unnecessarily fantastical elements. Also take into consideration that you are underwater, so you need an earthquake inactive area if you build on the seabed. 

I do not know exactly what kind of story you want to build, but as others said, the chance of success is so small that it cannot seriously be taken into account. If you want a more credible story I would suggest that you modify it to something like: 

Make them extremely religious. They are directly created by a God, so they are in touch with divinity. They are keepers of the righteous belief and the return of the God is directly linked to the "spark of belief". Then you can introduce a "satanic" group that they battle, or if other intelligent species exist (like normal people) they can fight the decadent inferior competitors. Or the "humans" rebel and do not help them maintain the belief in the God and they need to fight to crush the rebellions. You created a very interesting introduction with a direct manifestation of divinity. Why not use it to motivate them? That way you can link the very creation of new ones to their need to fight now (they need to keep the religious belief in their God so he will return and make more). The future reward justifies the sacrifices now.
