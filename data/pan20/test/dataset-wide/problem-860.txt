Yes it would. However, it also depends on your definition of "Detail". For some, it's a tight shot where the whole frame is only a few dozen arcseconds wide, and others think of detail as being wide field, but also "deep" - or having a very high signal to noise ratio. If you want wide field, and a high signal to noise ratio, then yes, a multi-camera array will work well, and you'd be able to accumulate a large number of high integration time images in a relatively short amount of time. So here's a breakdown of what you and others who may not know need to know about deep sky astrophotography: The main goal for all photos is to produce as visually pleasing image as possible. A single image taken of any target will accumulate light from many sources. The first, and obvious source is the light from whatever target you're trying to photograph. The second, less obvious source is light pollution from man-made sources, the moon, and natural sky glow. The third source is the electronic and thermal noise of the camera itself. Technically, all of these sources are "signal" - however two of the three are unwanted, so we will call the light pollution signal and the camera signal 'noise'. Longer exposures produce more signal from what you want, but also more noise from what you don't want. Luckilly, noise can be reduced by using several techniques in conjunction with each other. First, you need to take long photos. The signal will increase linearly with time. A 60s photo with a signal of "x" will have a tenth of the signal as a 600s photo. Noise, however, increases with the square root of the exposure. Using the same example, the 600s photo will have a signal to noise ratio that is about 3.2 (sqrt of 10) times better than the single 60s photo. Increasing the Signal to noise ratio by taking longer exposures is the first step to producing 'detailed' wide field images. Camera noise can be further reduced by taking many images. An array of cameras makes this trivial. Two cameras will produce twice the images as one camera, and 10 cameras will produce 10 times the images as a single camera. That's obvious. Why does it matter? When we stack images, the more we have, the better the stacking algorithms can preserve the signal we want to keep, and reduce the camera noise we don't. Once again, the signal to noise ratio mathematics work out the same as above. 1 image will have a certain signal to noise ratio, but 10 images will have a signal to noise ratio that can be about 3.2 times higher - because the total integration time has increased ten fold. Of course, if you're stacking photos, you should be calibrating them as well (dark frames, bias frames, etc) - which really reduce the amount of noise per sub-frame. Because of this, your actual SNR boost by stacking should in theory be a lot higher than 3.2. If photographed a target across 60 degrees of the sky (30 before meridian and 30 after) then you'd be able to acquire photos for 4 hours. One camera taking 10 minute photos would get 24 photos in the 4 hour period of time. If you had 5 cameras, you'd get 96 photos. 72 additional photos in the same amount of time is a lot of extra data to help reduce the noise, and really let the faint details stand out above the background - especially if all of your photos were well calibrated. 

Yes. You would have to wait 4.5 billion years to see the observer at point A looking back at you through his telescope. You would now be looking at a cooling hunk of molten rock with no moon or oceans. No. If you waited 4.5 billion years and saw Observer A, he would have been dead for 4.5 billion years by the time you see him. In fact, his Sun would likely be expanding to the point of burning his planet to a cinder if not engulfing it entirely. But of course, you would have to wait another 4.5 billion years to see that. You would be observing the photons that bounced off Observer A all that time ago and have been traveling ever since. It is important to note that this is not him, and does not mean he still exists. 

I don't see any reason why dark matter couldn't be considered a medium just as air or water are, but this does not mean that your conclusion is correct. Dark matter does not interact with photons, however the reason we know dark matter exists is because of the measurable effect of its gravity. Galaxies have a tendency to clump around it. Light travels unimpeded at its standard rate between galaxies where we don't detect any dark matter, so interesting question though it is, I'm afraid the answer is no. 

The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours. (Well, actually a little less, by about 17 minutes, but close enough.) That's $360^\circ$ in 24 hours, or about $15^\circ$ per hour. $15^\circ$ is 30 times the width of the Sun or Moon. The Sun moves exactly that fast (on average), the stars a smidgen faster, and the Moon a tad slower. (The Moon lags behind the stars by approximately its own width every hour.) Since Venus is never more than about $45^\circ$ from the Sun, it always sets at most 3 hours after the Sun does, and rises at most 3 hours before. 

If you project the orbits onto a plane, for example the plane of the ecliptic, the projections will cross. But that's only because you're looking at a 3D problem in 2D. If you look at the orbits in 3D, you'll see that Pluto's orbit is highly inclined (17ยบ) from the ecliptic, so it never actually passes through Neptune's orbit. Each time it seems to cross (in the 2D view), it's actually well above or well below Neptune's orbit. Pluto and Neptune never come closer than about 17AU. At least for now. Minor perturbations over tens of millions of years may change that. Or might not. Pluto and Neptune currently have a 3:2 resonance, and such resonances tend to be stable. You might want to look at $URL$ especially the section "Relationship with Neptune". 

In retrospect, we now know that the peak brightness was indeed 10.5 during the first week of February, 2014: $URL$ 

Technically speaking, only the Moon would crash into the Sun. That being said, it's certainty one of many possibilities in the far distant future. About 7.6 billion years from now, the Sun will have ballooned to a large enough size to engulf much of the inner solar system. One of the consequences of growing into a small red giant will be mass lost due to a rapid sheding of material through a stronger solar wind. This mass loss will allow all of the planets to be pulled on by the Sun less, and they can achieve a higher orbit. In Earth's case, it could be as much as 1.2 AU from the center of the Sun. Also, there will eventually be a large increase in the solar wind density where Earth orbits the Sun. This solar wind and chromosphere will create drag on Earth while in motion around the Sun, and will rob the planet of its angular momentum (orbital velocity). The Earth will slowly begin to transition into a smaller orbit, and some sources think that this may lead to the Earth falling into the Sun. In this scenario, Earth-Moon system is gravitationally stable, and the Earth has sufficient gravity to hold onto the Moon during this time - Earth will pull the Moon down with it. What is not known to me is if the drag from the solar wind and chromospher will cause the Moon to lose enough angular momentum to spiral inwards, ultimately merging with the Earth before the Earth is engulfed by the Sun. This would be a spectacular sight, as the moon would first be ripped apart by the tidal interaction with Earth (inside the Roche limit, or about 11,500 miles from the center of the Earth). Our Moon would resemble a string of moonlets, each eventually falling to Earth. Either way, the result is the same - the Moon will only exist within the Sun. Sources: $URL$ $URL$ 

Both articles mention MIDAS (the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System). Since the first link is from 2006, perhaps soon we will have a good estimate for you. 

Hopefully this answers your question, though it doesn't have much to do with Special Relativity, it's still good blow-your-mind stuff. It's just speed of light stuff which we really knew and measured (albeit inaccurately) long before Einstein. 

We generally like you to check google before posting questions here. I posed your question to google and amongst other links, I got these: $URL$ $URL$ Per Bill cook in the top link: 

First off, if Earth were point B, and you were an observer at point A looking at it with the most magnificent telescope ever imagined, you would still not see the Earth, because it didn't exist 13 billion years ago. I assume you picked 13 billion years because it is roughly the age of the universe, so you'd see the universe as it existed then, but that doesn't get you what I think you want. I will instead pick 4.5 billion years ago (or objects A and B 4.5 billion light years apart), because then you will have an actual Sun and Earth to look at but long before life evolved. We'll also wave our arms over the tracking software of your telescope being able to locate Sun and Earth in their orbits over the course of 4.5 billion years as seen from point B. 

You know, the first time someone told me this, I was absolutely certain they were confused, ignorant, or otherwise mistaken, and I told him he had his facts wrong. To be precise, we were talking about an observer on the equator. I maintained that the Sun would rise due east and set due west, all year round. He said no. What gave me pause, though, is that this person was far from ignorant, so maybe the other two appellations didn't fit either. I went home and tried to construct a convincing proof of my side, and in the middle of the night a very simple and convincing proof did come to mind. Except that it was a proof that I was wrong. Imagine that you're on equator at sunrise on the summer solstice. Due east is along the equator. But the plane of the equator is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit, and the Sun is well above (north) of it. You cannot see it due east at sunrise. It has to be $23.5^\circ$ north of east. (Remember, this is for an observer on the equator.) By the same token, the Sun must rise $23.5^\circ$ south of east on the winter solstice, and gradually transition between these extremes during the year. 

Let me see if I can ask a different question that will help you understand why these other answers are correct. If you weigh yourself at night (when the Earth's gravity and the Sun's gravity are pulling in the same direction), do you weigh significantly more than you do during the day (when the Sun would be 'pulling you up'? The answer is no, because the Sun doesn't have a noticeable effect on your weight. If the Earth suddenly stopped rotating around its axis, everything not nailed to the Earth would get flung West at about 1000 mph including you and your scale. But a 150 lb human would still weigh 150 lbs as they splattered against the nearest building/mountain. If the Earth suddenly stopped revolving around the Sun, anything on the leading hemisphere would launch off the Earth at roughly 67,000 mph (well above escape velocity), and this includes things like oceans and atmosphere. Anything on the trailing side would simply smash into the ground at 67,000 mph, effectively burying the goo that used to be you miles underground. Worse things would happen as well, such as the Earth's molten core erupting through the crust, etc., but no one would be alive long enough to lament it. But just as your mass doesn't change when you go on a trampoline, it wouldn't change based on the Earth's rotation or revolution. Notice I said mass this time and not weight. If you had presence of mind during your last fleeting moments to hold your trusty scale under your feet, it would probably register '0', but that is because of your momentum, not because of the gravitational interaction between you and the Earth, which is what we call weight. You would still be 150 pounds, you would just be a 150 pound pile of goo somewhere unexpected. 

The distances to the two main bodies are not only equal, they are equal to the distance between the two main bodies. In other words, the two main bodies and L4 (or L5) form an equilateral triangle. 

Kepler's third law is trivial (in my opinion) compared to his first law. I am quite impressed that he was able to deduce that the orbits were ellipses. To get that, he had to go back and forth plotting Mars' direction from Earth and Earth's direction from Mars. He knew the length of both planets' years, so observations taken one Mars year apart would differ only because Earth had moved. But maybe not so trivial. He published his first two laws in 1609. The third law didn't come along until ten years later, in 1619. With ten years to work on it, even the most obscure relationship will eventually be found. To discover a ratio-of-powers relationship, plot the logarithms of the numbers. In your example with $x^4 = y^3$, the logs would plot on a straight line with a slope of $3/4$. The timing is right. Napier published his book on logarithms in 1614. Kepler may have on a whim applied this shiny new mathematical tool to his crusty old data. The major hurdle was that at the time there were only six known planets, so he didn't have an abundance of data points, and the ones he had were by no means precise. Kepler's other problem is that none of his laws made any sense to him. They fit the data, but he had no idea why. He didn't have Newton's laws of motion to work from, he had no understanding of force, momentum, angular momentum, and certainly not gravity. So far as he knew, the planets moved the way they did because God decreed it, and angels were tasked with pushing the planets along their orbits. The outer planets moved slower because they were being pushed by lesser angels. (Feynman makes the comment that we understand so much more now. We now know that the angels are on the outside pushing in toward the Sun.)
