We estimate something smaller than $\int 1 \, da(u)$: $$ \int_0^x e^{-\delta u} \, da(u) < e^x \big[ o(1) + (1 + \epsilon) \big]$$ In order to do as much Montgomery and Vaughan use a single "trigonometric" lemma. There exist two functions $f\pm (x) \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ $$ f_-(x) \leq e^{-x} \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{R}^-} \leq f_+(x) $$ where $f_\pm (x)$ are made of only specific wavelengths, $ \hat{f}(t)= 0$ unless $|t| < T$. Finally the total mass of $f$ is somewhat near $1$: $$ 1 - \epsilon < \int_\mathbb{R} f_-(x) dx < \int_\mathbb{R} f_+(x) dx < 1 + \epsilon $$ How is such a construction achieved: This looks somewhat like a low pass filter: 

Here, it wasn't hard to find that intersection point even without the reduction from Helly's theorem. What kind of interesting collections of convex sets result in non-trivial uses of Helly's theorem? $URL$ 

The conjecture seem to say that the Picard group (possibly $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is mixing) on the images of the algebraic numbers in $\mathbb{H}$ in the limit of large norm. What is the status of this conjecture? And why they say "packet" of CM points (I gave my best guess)? Is this related to the Quantum Mechanical wave packets? 

EDIT: One point of the fundamental theorem of algebra is smooth deformations in the space of polynomials will not change the number of roots (if we projectivize). Proofs always involve deformations from arbitrary polynomials to $p(z) = z^n$ for some natural number degree $n = \deg p$. If we add a periodic "time" variable, I expected each root to follow a disjoint closed path, but instead paths join together sometimes. So I started to ask about the number of components. Geometrically, I would like to know if you can deform $\{ f(z,t)=0 \} \in \mathbb{C} \times S^1$ without changing the number of components. From the comments, it sounds like the number of components is constant unless the discriminant vanishes and whether it takes values in the unit circle. As long as these two events do not happen, is the topology of this set "constant"? As an example: $f(z,t) = 1 + 3 z t + z^2 t + z^3 (2 + t)$ can be deform to $f_0(z,t) = z^3 + t z$ by "turning off" various coefficients. The number of components will be 2. $URL$ 

As a complex space, I believe $S^2 \simeq \widehat{\mathbb{C}}= \mathbb{C} \cup \{ \infty\}$ is called the Riemann sphere or $\mathbb{C}P^1$ with a standard identification via MÃ¶bius transformations. If we identify $\mathbb{C}\simeq \mathbb{R}^2$ and remember the complex structure, we might be OK. As a complex projective space we might consider the Hopf fibration $\mathbb{C}P^1 = S^3/S^1$ or possibly $U(2)/\big( U(1) \times U(1) \big)$, perhaps leading to appropriate choices of $G$ and $H$. 

In order to specify what I am looking for here is the result for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$: $$ \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \simeq \big\{ S,T : S^2 = 1,\; (ST)^3 = 1 \big\} \quad\text{with}\quad S = \left( \begin{array}{rr} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{array} \right) \text{ and } T = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right)$$ At least over $\mathbb{Z}$ there an exact sequence relating the congruence groups to the special linear group over finite fields: $$ 1 \to \Gamma(N) \to \Gamma \to \text{PSL}_2\big(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}\big) \to 1 $$ And so it's likely that congruence groups of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ should have finite presentations. Even if I do something slightly more inefficient and use the exact sequence. 

Basically... $C^\ast$ algebras supposed to be the "same" as quantum mechanical systems. So what is the quantum mechanical system corresponding to the non-commutative torus $A_\theta$ ? The article says define Poisson bracket on the phase space $C^\infty(\mathbb{T}^2)$ by $$\{ f,g \} = \theta \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_2} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_1} \right)$$ Then build this deformed multiplication $\ast_\hbar$ such that $$f \ast_\hbar g - g \ast_\hbar f = i\hbar\{ f,g\} + O(\hbar^2) $$ Then quantizing we get $[ x_1, x_2] = i\theta\hbar$, which looks like $\theta$ could be absorbed into $\hbar$ ? This might be semiclassical analysis or something. I don't understand this: 

What are these characters $\langle x | R \rangle$ ? Originally, I wanted to ask about an analogue for finite $G$, but I don't even have a point of reference. 

I post this question here because I know explicit Morse functions always exist but can be difficult to find. And I'm trying to work out the critical points and visualize the Morse flow. And perhaps I should clarify what I mean by "explicit". I believe the unit tangent bundle could be given the structure of a variety. Looking at our construction, we could try to embed $$ T^1(S^2) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$$ I don't think his is quite the "universal bundle" construction, but it's something. And we could write down the constraints: 

Google searching for "microlocal" analysis leads me astray. I found work of Kashiwara which I shall not even mention here... How does WKB fail to be rigorous? What kind of machinery gets introduced with microlocal analysis? 

So the theory specializes in many different ways, and they all have really great properties. However, there are simply too many and I have lost track. On the physics side, I know the way to understand all of these is Chern-Simons Theory and a small amount of google-fu returns 

The Krawtchouk ensemble is defined by a weight: $w(x) = \binom{K}{x}p^x q^{K-x} $ and in fact it comes from a conditioned random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^N$. It is a probability measure on the set $\{ 0, 1, \dots, K\}^N $. Each sequence has probability: $$ \mathbb{P}[h] = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{i < j} (h_i - h_j)^2 \prod_{j=1}^N \binom{K}{h_j} \frac{1}{2^K}$$ where $Z$ is a number such that the sum over all sequences is $\Sigma=1$. What are the correlations of this probability distribution? Is it safe to assume this is a determinantal process? In that case it would be very easy to write down the correlations... E.g. $$ \mathbb{P}[h_1, h_3] = \frac{1}{Z} (h_3 - h_1)^2 \times \binom{K}{h_1} \frac{1}{2^K} \times \binom{K}{h_3} \frac{1}{2^K}$$ However, I haven't shown it has a Kernel. Certainly the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) is determinantal. The distribution of a random Hermitian matrix $N \times N$ is: $$ \mathbb{P}(\lambda) = \prod_{i < j} (\lambda_i - \lambda_j)^2 e^{- \sum_1^N \lambda_i^2}$$ and these probabilities can all be written as determinants because there is a Kernel: $$K_N(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^N \phi_i (x) \, \phi_i(y) \, e^{-(x^2 + y^2)/4} $$ This looks anwful lot like the ensemble I've just written, because of the DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorem $$ \binom{n}{k} \frac{1}{2^n} \simeq \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi n }} \exp\left[- \frac{(k - \frac{1}{2}n)^2}{\frac{1}{2}n} \right] $$ so mainly, I am asking if there's similar Kernel for the Krawtchouk distribution above. 

Antonella Grassi explain that nothing too exceptional occurs, so that for example $K_C = \mathcal{O}(-1)$, and the coordinates $x,y,z$ can be identified with hyperplanes $\{ x=0\}, \{ y = 0\}, \{z=0\}$ and then $[x],[y],[z]$ are hyperplane divisors and $H\cdot C$ is just setting $x$, $y$, or $z = 0$. For much more please turn to the standard texts: 

if instead of $ \mathbb{R}$ try a ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ these are Bianchi groups. I am not am expert. the case of $\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has explicit generators as found by Hurwitz 

Edit As discussed in the comments, it appears in Katznelson's textbook although I don't understand his example very well - convolving a function with the Fejer kernel many times at different scales. 

Do people study the category of representations of a compact finite group (not just irreducible ones)? I'm more interested in small cases like S_3 and SU(2) but I'd be curious about general cases like $S_n, SU(n)$. These must be tensor categories since - well... they admit tensor products and direct sums. Can these representations be considered a ring? ** What does this category look like in the case of S_3? 

What is the birth-death process associated to the Hermite polynomials or the Legendre polynomials? or maybe in general What do we reconstruct the birth-death processes correspond to the classical orthogonal polynomials? 

Karamata shows A and B using a lemma: $$ \lim_{x\to 1} (1-x)\sum a_n x^n g(x) = \int_0^1 g(t) \, dt$$ using a certain choice of $g(x)$ he proves A and B. Is it also possible to prove C this way? I don't know if that is also considered the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem. Wikipedia says yes, other sources indicate no. Hardy and Littlewood wrote many Tauberian Theorems. Other places I have looked: 

Penot's textbook teaches functional analysis in analogy with convex geometry, even if it's not too visual. 

Looking at Zagier's Eisenstein Series and the Riemann Zeta Function, we get a proof of the prime number theorem using horocycles. I would really love it if there were a geometric proof like this. What happens if we use a smaller region of non-vanishing..? On the fifth page, he show that $\zeta(1 + it) \neq 0$ using properties of the horocycle flow. 

The Schur polynomials satisfy many, many identities and there is a whole book about them. I think the easiest way is with the Vandermonde Determinant. $$s_{3,1,1}(a,b,c) = \frac{\left|\begin{array}{ccc} a^5 & b^5 & c^5 \\\\ a^2 & b^2 & c^2 \\\\ a & b & c\end{array} \right|}{(a - b)(b - c)(c - a)} = \left|\begin{array}{ccc} e_3 & e_2 & e_1 \\\\ e_2 & e_1 & e_0 \\\\ e_3 & e_2 & e_1\end{array} \right| = \left|\begin{array}{ccc} h_3 & h_2 & h_1 \\\\ h_2 & h_1 & h_0 \\\\ h_3 & h_2 & h_1\end{array} \right|$$ Where the $e_k$ are elementary symmetric polynomials and the $h_k$ are the homogeneous symmetric polynomials (the first is linear in each variable, the other isn't.) (3,1,1) is its own transpose. Are there similar, easy to compute ways to find skew-Schur polynomials? For example, how to find $s_{(3,2,1)\backslash(1)}(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ - which is three squares along a diagonal the W penomino? I know it is also possible to get (skew-)Schur polynomials as the matrix elements of a certain propagator acting on free fermions and using the Wick formula. For example, here. 

I apologize for the lousy aspect ratio. In general, does the limit shape depend only on the coutour or does it depend "microscopically" on the boundary conditions as well?
