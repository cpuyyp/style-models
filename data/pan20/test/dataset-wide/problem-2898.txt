Boethius's The Consolations of Philosophy (6th century AD) was written in alternating prose and verse. It was translated to English from the Latin by H.R. James (1897). Here is one translated excerpt, part of a poetic exposition of Plato's theory of Recollection. 

I think there is no philosophical or logical sense in which two things are simply similar. Instead, things are similar, or not, in some respect, or in some regard. For example, A yellow cube is similar to a yellow sphere with regard to color, but dissimilar with regard to shape. Two logically valid arguments may be similar in various ways: in regard to logical form (e.g. modus ponens), in being sound (having true premises), in having negative premises, in having the same number of premises, etc. 

Kant's epistemology requires the analytic/synthetic distinction, because it puts crucial emphasis on synthetic-a-priori statements. Quine does away with the a-priori entirely, and therefore does also not require the analytic/synthetic distinction. 

A predicate Q, or a description "the Q", are called self contradictory iff any attempt to use them will entail a self contradiction. This is the sense in which "the set of all sets" has been proved to be self contradictory. 

If you have never heard differential equations talking to you while walking in the forest, it’s because you aren’t trying to analyse the forest on your walk and so you don’t need to hear anything mathematical. We can all contemplate and appreciate Nature, how beautiful it is, and while we do so we don’t need maths or anything technical. It is when we wish to study Nature, when we want to understand why a particular aspect of Nature behaves as it does, that we need some technical language – and maths is the language that has been developed throughout history for this purpose. Understanding Nature through mathematics in no way takes away our appreciation of Nature; on the contrary it compliments and enhances our love and respect for it. If we tried to analyse Nature without maths (as primitive humans did) it would be all too easy to slip into superstitions and false beliefs. 

The statement (¬Y)→(¬X) is called the contrapositive of the statement X→Y. A statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. 

"Harriet will go if and only if Gloria goes" means the statements "Harriet will go" and "Gloria will go" have the same truth values; that is to say 

The answer lies in the Phaedo, not much after the passage on suicide, to which you referred. The issue of suicide arises in the context of the question, put to Socrates, why he seemed to favor death, rather than struggling to avoid it. And a part of his answer was, that the knowledge which the philosopher seeks all his life, seems to await him after death. Because the body is mainly an obstruction to true knowledge. Knowledge is, then, not merely possible after death. It seems to be more possible after death than during life. At least so for someone, like a philosopher, who has been preparing himself during life... 

(*) The Principles of Philosophy were published in Latin in 1644, and in French in 1647, three years before Descartes's death. So they seem to be quite authoritative as to Descartes's mature views. 

Luckily for his mental health and sanity, when he takes a break from philosophy, nature herself resuscitates him. 

First, idealism and empiricism are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, almost all the empiricists, from Berkeley to Ayer, were idealists. Quine himself was non-commital about idealism (see his "on what there is"). What "saved" Quine from being an idealist like his empiricist predecessors, is that he usually rejected "sense data", the supposed mental intermediary between mind and world. Instead, Quine held that our connection to the world is merely causal. That is, without intermediary, but also without representation. 

This is how you interpret the two propositions “intuitively”. When working with formal logic, however, it is important not to be distracted by intuition. Focus on the relations between statements and their truth values, not the meanings of the statements themselves. The two intuitive interpretations above look simiar and may even seem to be identical, but they are NOT identical. If you analyse them closely, you will find that, given that each of the statements A, B. C is false, Proposition 1 is false while Proposition 2 is true. Let us see why. The assertion A → B is true because A is false: it is an example of a vacuous truth. (Intuitively you might say that “if I have wings then I can fly” is a true assertion – but again I must warn you to leave intuition alone for now. The assertion is true not because I have wings but because I don’t!) Hence Proposition 1 ((A → B) → C) is of the form TRUE → FALSE, and such an implication is . What about Proposition 2 (A → (B → C))? Well, since A is false, the whole of the proposition is , whatever the rest of it may be (it is another example of a vacuous truth). Since I have no wings, any assertion conditional upon my having wings is automatically true.
