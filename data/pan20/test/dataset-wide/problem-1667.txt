According to our today knowledge, the census in Syria took place at 6 or 7 AD. From the writings of Flavius Josephus, a second census seems impossible, since the census was unknown to the Jews. More: Their province didn't belong to Syria before 6 or 7 AD. But Herodes died 4 BCE so there is a 10 to 11 year gap between both possibilities. Some authors have speculated, that Luke might have confused Herod the Great with another Herod, Herod Antipas, but the gospel of Mathew clearly speaks about Herod the Great. So the story of the birth is inconsistent with other historically more reliable material. Some Original sources: 

A value of 1.618 is reached for 21.247°, which is even in the south of the slightly more south city 'Al Taif'. If you pan with the mouse over the map of OpenStreetMap, you can read the position in the lower right corner. 

Born of a virgin This would be a longer discussion. AFAIK only catholics see it this way. (see discussion with DJClayworth, which led to this correction). Birth was accompanied by a star in the east Source: Mt 2.3-8. Yes, part of the myth for Jesus. After his birth was adored by three kings Wise men from the East are mentioned by Mt2 and Lk2.7. Not how many of them exactly, and they aren't described as kings. This is a later legend. 

Karl Wilhelm Otto Lilienthal (* 23. Mai 1848 in Anklam; † 10. August 1896 in Berlin after a crash with one of his flying machines). $URL$ He invented the principle of the profile of the wing, and was one of the first, who recognized, that you needn't be thinner than air, to fly (principle of the Mongolfiere). 

Here is an interview (LANG=DE) with the German Theologian Hermann Detering, who wrote the book „Falsche Zeugen. Außerchristliche Jesuszeugnisse auf dem Prüfstand“ (False witnesses, exochristian Jesus witnesses on trial). My abstract: You can't take the bible for granted, because it isn't a historic book, but a statement of faith. It's hard to tell, when it was written and by whom. Most author names, mentioned, are wrong. Some parts of it are first mentioned in the beginning of the 2nd century, but from witnesses, who are themselves faked. There are 6 main witnesses outside of Christianity: 

Here is an article (LANG=DE), talking about the dependency of fingerprints from a single gene, cited in the . They don't talk about manipulation of fingerprints, but of the mutation, they observed in whole families (there are only 4 families known, with multiple people affected from the deviation), which they investigated further, to find out, that a single modification is responsible, to make the fingerprint vanish. (But from the beginning - not modifying a living person or adult). Fingerprints are available after 24 weeks of pregnancy, and don't change significantly later. Whether it will be possible, to provoke this in near future, isn't discussed. 

They didn't help much in the finding, whether Jesus was a historic person. In the Qumran text, he doesn't take place at all, and in the gnostic literature of Nag Hammadi, he is mostly a mythologic figure. The whole question of historic Jesus isn't new, and was debated before WWII in Germany, but abandoned afterwards. But today, there are new methods to analyse scriptures. With modern databases, it is possible to find favourite words for different authors. So were words and phrases found in texts, which weren't used in the time, the document supposedly origins. This shows, that the texts were redacted. An example is the „Testimonium Flavianum“ from Josephus. He mentions Jesus as a wise man. But early, Christian literature from that time doesn't mention that witness, as one would expect. The christian historian Eusebius is the first to mention the witness of Josephus. Unfortunately, his wording and phrases are very similar to the wording and phrases of Josesphus. The roman historian Sueton mentions a man called 'Chrestos', who shall, under imperator Claudius (reg.: 41-54) , agitated the Jews of Rome to furor. Then Claudius displaced the Jews from Rome. But Jesus is said to died under imperator Tiberius (reg.: 14-37), and Christus is not Chrestos, which was a common name for slaves in Rome. Then there is the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote about the burning of Rome under Nero, as filmed in Hollywood. Isn't this a witness of early prosecution of Christs? Well - early Christian scriptures don't talk about this important event. Only later writings from about 300-400 BC talk about it, and again, the words and phrases of the reporting Tacitus, and his 'source', Sulpicius Severus are very similar. Today, historians doubt, that Nero burned Rome. So the conclusion is not only, that the existence of Jesus is questionable, but the existence of an early Christianity in the first century too. First witnesses are from the mid of the second century, namely imperator Marc Aurel. 

There is a theory, which claims, that eye damage in former times often resulted from using Jacob's staff for navigation on sea, but not from injuries during fights. Search for Augenklappe in the german wikipedia. However, pirates are much older than this instrument, and nowadays pirates surely don't use it any more. So it could have evolved as a cliché for pirates, while it is common to all seafaring of a certain time. 

Here is a list of the 10 largest earthquakes measured since 1900. We have about 1.3 Million earthquakes of magnitude 2 to 2.9, and 134 of 6 to 6.9 per year. But most of them happen in the sea, in deserts or far from cities. But we have an increasing world population, so the number of affected persons can climb over the century. We have increasing numbers of artifacts which can be damaged, and therefore increasing damages in form of costs, while predictions of earthquakes get better, and the number of EQ-resistant builduings increases, which meanwhile lowers, but doesn't compensate, the damages. And we have an increasing number of stations which measure EQs. Numbers of USGS and GFZ Potsdam Oh - I forgot the answer: :) NO For the last 100 years, there is no increasing number of EQs. But the timespan of interest might be choosen to fit the claim. You could watch just for a few weeks and EQs stronger than x. I guess it isn't possible to count prehistoric earthquakes today. 

... the birth of Jesus happened during the kingdom of Herodes. And according to Lk 2,2, Cyrenius was governor of Syria at that time: 

That means: Who prepares a law violation as in § 202a and b, which is spying on data and catching foreign data by producing, organizing, selling, renting or spreading a program or giving access to such a program can be punished with jail or a monetary penalty. In former times, only the concrete action was prohibited (202 a and b). In the discussion of the law in the parlament, which I followed in full length and discussed at multiple occasions, many experts argued that the possible victims of such programs need access to them to defend themselves. That the tool in itself isn't evil, only some uses. The parties which argued for the law didn't solve the conflict, that they wanted to restrict production and spreading of such tools in general for prophylactic reasons and the idea only to ban bad usage. The problem has now to be solved in court. The judges can refer in their decision not only to the text of the law, but to the protocols of the debate in the parlament to make a decision in the spirit of the law. AFAIK, the law is in force for about 5 years now, but got recently fresh attention by a commercially available hacking tool and the house search by police of many people, who ordered that tool. But there is not a definitive list of software which is affected by the law. The court has to rule in each single case. 

The smaller your universe is, the bigger a flood is. If you don't know that Africa, Europe, Asia, America and Antarctic exist, it's impossible to know that the whole earth is covered. I'm sure so; see Charles about Seattle. Investigate weather stations in regions of rain periods. To cover Himalaya, Alpen, Anden, Appalachen, Rocky Mountains and so on: Not enogh water. But from rain apart, tsunamis, smelting ice, river outbreaks (rain elsewhere) cause dramatique floods. If you know 500 species, most of them small, you can imagine them to fit into a big ship. Today, we know how many different animals there are, and that you need much bigger groups, to have enough genetic diversity to let one survive. But of cause predators need other animals as meal as well. To put all of them, and enough food on a ship, the ship would need to be multiple times the size of the Maracana stadium. So it's just a story.
