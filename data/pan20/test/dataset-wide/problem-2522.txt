2. ‘Sankhara’ as ‘conditioners’. Here, ‘sankhara’ as ‘conditioners’ refers to the words ‘kaya sankhara’, ‘vaci sankhara’ & ‘citta sankhara’, which are found at the 2nd condition of Dependent Origination & at stages 4, 7 and 8 of the Anapanasati Sutta and which are defined in MN 44 as follows: 

The four foundations of mindfulness are in the Satipatthana Sutta & Anapanasati Sutta. The Satipatthana Sutta is merely a list of disconnected teachings and it is highly unlikely the Buddha spoke the Satipatthana Sutta in its current form. As for the Anapanasati Sutta, it logically describes the fruition or unfolding of the four foundations of mindfulness one after eachother in terms of path fruition. For example, when the breathing is calmed, rapture will arise. Rapture & happiness (feelings) become the predominant meditation object & replace the breathing as the primary meditation object (even though the breathing remains a secondary or anchor meditation object). Therefore, contemplation of feelings (vedanupassana) must occur after kayanupassana (contemplation of bodies) Every stage of the Anapanasati Sutta is practised with awareness of breathing, including contemplation of the mind (cittanupassana), as explicitly stated in the sutta. Therefore, if the practitioner loses awareness of breathing or loses concentration, that is not the practise of anapanasati. What this means is being vaguely of aware of all kinds of distracting thoughts & emotions is not the practise of cittanupasana. Cittanupasana is something deeply profound & occurs with concentration (samadhi). 

Therefore, the more sexual partners, which is interactions based on lust, the more suffering. Buddhism teaches to relate to people with non-harming (ahimsa), loving-kindness (metta) & compassion (karuna). Therefore, there is absolutely no place in Buddhism for the recommendation or endorsement of sexual promiscuity, because sexual promiscuity is a behaviour (kamma) rooted in lust. MN 9, which is about Right View, states: 

This seems to show following the Abrahamic god creates an evil nature. In other words, the immoral feelings are due to how your religion created you, as explained in Genesis 6 of the Bible. The history of the world seems to show people who believe in a supernatural entity like God are more evil than those that don't. For example, Christians have been at war among themselves & with others for hundreds of years & have destroyed many indigenous cultures with their imperialism. Even today, the American prison system contains more theists than atheists. I would suggest this is because God-believers want to exercise violent power over others; following the example of God as depicted in various scriptures that show God excising violent absolute power. Even the evil of atheist dictatorial Communism was created by Jews, with a violent dictatorial yet classless ideology similar to Judaism. Thus theistic religions have a tendency to attract evil people who lust for power and who want to act on this earth towards the humans as though they are gods. Unfortunately, the good human people of this earth have to endure these wanna-be gods, like we must do, such as endure the evil politicians who today run the USA and are God-believers, both Christian & Zionist; who finance & arm Saudi terrorists that murder people while screaming: "Allah U Akbar" or "God is Great". 

The Buddha put an emphasis on many dhammas. The Buddha did not actually teach to constantly remind oneself of anicca because this would mean the mind is always thinking. Instead, one only reminds oneself of anicca when necessary. The goal of meditation is to stop thinking so the mind has concentration so it can develop calm and then see anicca directly (rather than reminding oneself about anicca). Reminding oneself about 'anicca' is called 'anicca sanna'. Where as seeing anicca directly is called 'vipassana'. Reminding oneself about 'anicca' is not 'vipassana' 

In summary, similar to DN 15, the idea the consciousness is reborn in the form of a 're-linking consciousness', 'stream of consciousness', 'mindstream', 'storehouse consciousness', etc, are all ideas created after the passing of the Buddha by different & various Buddhist schools. These terms about a 'rebirth consciousness' commonly used by Buddhists have no source in the original teachings. The Pali scriptures actually state that "beings" ("sattā") or "men & women " (itthī vā puriso vā) are 'reborn'. To quote: 

If you are Indian, you must know the word 'jati', which is the central term used in Pali Buddhism, does not mean physical birth or childbirth. It means self or social identity or caste: 

Buddhism calls the physical 'material' ('rupa') and the mental 'immaterial' ('arupa') however it also states mind-&-body ('nama-rupa') are dependent upon eachother (refer to Nalakalapiyo Sutta). Buddhism states the arising of consciousness without a physical body & sense organs is impossible (Upaya Sutta; Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta; etc). It is likely mentality arises from the physical, as your scientific friends say, since when brain injury occurs, mental impairment follows. I like the following quote attributed to (Gnostic) Jesus: 

Therefore, when you are washing the dishes, the practise of mindfulness is to wash the dishes without craving, i.e., without greed (impatience), hatred (aversion) & delusion (self-views). When this right mindfulness (remembering) is practised, the observation will occur automatically. 

This means to not try to feel, track or be aware of the breath sensations. Instead, it means to only keep the mind exclusively focused towards the nose. It means to never concern yourself with watching the breath, even if the breath comes into the mind as an object of awareness. Just keep the mind still & anchored in one place. 

Craving ('tanha'; lit. 'thirst') as the cause of suffering is taught in both; as is the end of craving being 'Nibbana' or 'Eternal Life'. 

The Pali scriptures state enlightenment brings about the end of the "I-conceit" (MN 22); the end of 'I-making' & 'my-making'. The Pali scriptures (very end of MN 38) states 'birth' ends while the mind remains conscious, which supports Buddhadasa's view that 'birth' refers to the birth of the 'I' concept. SN 22.81 also supports Buddhadasa's view. 

Yes. When the sense of knower & doer disappear, this is insight into anatta (not-self) of the five aggregates. The five aggregates operate on their own, without a self controlling them. 

The Pali scriptures (SN 12.17) state, from the perspective of ultimate truth, that the cause of suffering is 'ignorance' (rather than 'one-self' or 'another'). However, in the conventional scenario presented in the question, the father is causing the suffering because a 3 year old child does not have the cognitive capacity to engage the Buddhist path. What is occurring to the child has no relationship to any (imaginary) past lives. I have never read this idea in the Pali suttas, where suffering (dukkha), let alone the suffering of helpless small children, is attributed to past lives. The suffering is due to the evil within the mind of the father because the child cannot overcome the in-born ignorance in their mind that is causing the suffering. Dhammapada 137 clearly states there are "innocent" victims of crime & AN 3.61 states what a person feels in not related to past kamma. 

The Buddha taught it is 'ignorance' ('not-knowing') that creates unskilful actions rather than 'our self'. The Buddha taught (in SN 12.17) to believe: "I create my own suffering" is a wrong view. That is why the Buddha does not blame people for unskilful actions but blames ignorance. 

When a sight comes before the eyes, a sound to the ears or a smell to the nose, there is no choosing involved here in terms of seeing, hearing or smelling. The seeing, hearing & smelling occur automatically, without choosing. Similarly, when the mind is actually getting enlightened by experiencing the truth, it is not involved in choosing. The mind may choose to establish itself in the path, that is, choose to develop concentration. However, the path is only the path & not the destination. Developing & establishing concentration is similar to removing dust from the eyes, wax from the ears or mucus from the nose. When the concentration is complete, i.e., when the mind is lucidly clear, the enlightenment occurs without any choosing. 

However, this does not represent the Buddha's Noble Path, such as expressed in the Noble Eightfold Path, where the 1st factor is practised 1st & the 2nd factor 2nd, etc, as explained below: 

It seems like your non-Buddhist mother understood the Dhamma (Truth) better than you. The 1st noble truth summarises all suffering as attachment (upadana) to the five aggregates. It is not about 'life' but about mental suffering. Birth, aging, death, sorrow, separation from loved, etc, are just examples of attachment (upadana). If you explain to your mother Buddhism is about happiness & suffering and it explains suffering occurs when there is clinging; be it clinging to life, clinging to a person or clinging to a view or opinion, your mother might agree; given mothers are prone to worry about their children because of clinging. This is how Queen Mallika explained the Dhamma to King Pasenadi in the Piyajatika Sutta. This said, be sure to explain the happiness (Nibbana) part of Buddhism, particularly the moral teachings about skilful kamma in relationships, such as metta & gratitude, including family relationships. Here, you can demonstrate how Buddhism nurtures your relationship with her. If you focus too much on suffering, your mother may think you are unhappy rather than happy. 

Yes. It can. The wisdom (panna) that can arise directly from concentration & samatha is that it is peaceful to be without defilements; that defilements are unwholesome & suffering. 

The idea of "I" is becoming. The questions "How can I understand becoming?" and "Can you give me a simile by which I can understand it?" are becoming because they are born of attachment & craving, as follows: 

The "I", "I", "I", is getting tedious and unrelated to Buddhism. There is a Hindu forum you can ask your question on, if the mind is unable to give up delusions of "I". 

'Knowledge & vision of things as they actually are' is the complete contemplation of not-self (although not-self can be observed in some ways when concentration starts to develop). 

Christianity is merely liberation via loving-kindness where as Buddhism is liberation via emptiness of self. 

Thus, it terms of actually causality (hetu), all the Buddha taught was the manifestation or knowing (paññāpanāyā) of consciousness is caused (hetu) by the mind & body (nama-rupa), as follows: 

True. But without less yet powerful insights, you can't get jhana. Therefore, the Dhammapada states, somewhere: 

Definitely not. MN 22 and DN 16 are explicitly clear that the Dhamma taught by the Buddha is open, straightforward, free from patchwork, with nothing hidden or secret. It is simply a matter of understanding the Pali words used.
