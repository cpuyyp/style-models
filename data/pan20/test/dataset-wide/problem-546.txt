(I happened to see these at $URL$ but do not know if they are up to spec. @WTHarper mentioned the McMaster-Carr site that has lots of options.) 

Since the frame is a mixte, the rear brakes are higher than the "top tube" of the mixte, along which runs my rear brake cable. I've seen that some mixtes use a reverse cable attachment to side-pull caliper brakes so that the cable makes a single arc from the top tube to the brakes. My goal is to roughly mimic this cable routing, but with cantilever brakes instead. Here is an example (but mine does not have a rack to work around): 

I am refurbishing a bike and am deciding how much to clean out the rear derailleur. It's in pretty good shape. But after I take off the chain, I tried spinning the jockey wheels with my fingers (after cleaning grime off the sides), and they only spin as long as I'm touching/pushing them -- they don't spin freely. Should I be concerned enough to take apart the derailleur and clean/re-oil or re-grease the jockey wheels? 

The former are generally quite expensive, and the latter ones don't provide good leverage and are prone to bending the valve tip or coming off the valve while pumping, etc. It seems so obvious to me that there should be a simple hose of, say 8 inches long, that would have a nozzle on one end to attach to the bike tube and the other end a fake Schrader or Presta valve head that the bike pump's nozzle would attach to. However, I have not seen them online or in stores. This product, if it exists, would be able to provide a lot of the convenience of those fancier pumps at a fraction of the cost, not to mention it would be a generic way to upgrade existing frame pumps. Of course, the extension should be able to handle the air pressure used for bike tires. Can anyone tell me if they do exist and, if so, where I could get one, or what they are called? 

Use as a dedicated truing stand. While not adjustable, the fork could be used for front wheels, back for rear wheels. 

Questions Q1. For rear cantilever brakes, are there any off-the-shelf parts or brake designs that route a rear brake cable from underneath the saddle cable instead of above? Q2. If not, then can anyone suggest an improvised, but proven setup using existing, readily-available parts? Q3. What concerns should I have with a reverse-pull cantilever brake setup (e.g. safety, maintenance)? Background I have a mixte frame with standard rear cantilever brake bosses on the seat stays, with standard cantilever brakes such as these: 

So, would this be alright? Does the original washer play any other role than just making the spacing correct? 

Some suggestions It's certainly possible to commute with a road bike. And you can work around or master the above issues with extra time in practice, additional hardware, new techniques. And note that almost any bike is going to get you 10km pretty easily. For these reasons above, I suggest following the other responders' suggestions on avoiding performance- or race- oriented road bikes. Consider: 

I live in the suburbs where there are many routes for road cyclists to go for rides. I assume these cyclists are riding for fun and/or exercise and/or to train for some kind racing events. Sometimes they are alone, other times they are in pairs or small groups. Many cyclists have big logos on their shorts and shirts. What are on the logos? Where do they get them? I don't see these in the online bike equipment stores. I can only guess that these are associated with professional racing. In any case, it seems that casual cycling folks don't have normal access to big-logo gear. Where would I get some? (I don't mean to sound judgemental, but I see it a lot but don't know where the gear comes from. I am curious about biking communities and what they wear. I am interested in hearing from those who wear such gear.) 

When replacing the cones for a front hub with new ones, is it okay to tighten the lock nut directly against the cone nut? Or must I use some kind of spacer / washer / shim in order for some other reason than spacing? The reason I ask is that I am replacing the cones on a front hub that was correctly spaced at 100mm. The old setup has 

The original build is pictured below (not the actual bike, but same model, etc.) and has the rear brake cable running along the "top tube", curving along the back of the seat tube, and then going over a pulley that is attached to the seat tube clamp bolt. That pulley acts as a housing stop and so it's a center-pull from the top. I am looking to improve the rear brake responsiveness, put less stress and wear on the cable, and have fun engineering a more elegant solution. 

On the original question As requested by the OP original question, the downsides of a road bike include: 

Can I safely put my 130mm internal geared hub on a 126mm spaced aluminum frame by forcing it? What are the consequences? How would the IGH be "damaged" by this? My IGH hub has a wheel laced and ready to use, but I would like to use this older, lugged aluminum frame I picked up cheap. I have heard that steel frames can be "cold set" (i.e. bent), but that aluminum frames cannot. However, I do find that there is some leeway in stretching the aluminum rear stays, so I think I could force the new IGH hub into the (horizontal) dropouts. However, Sheldon Brown says that IGH hubs might damaged when you put them on a spacing with the wrong size. I'm not sure if I would be effectively throwing away my IGH if I put it on this frame. Has anyone done such a thing? Does it affect the IGH? 

The replacement cones I got match in the old ones in all ways except that they are slightly wider (i.e. take more space of the axle). So, instead of getting two more cones ($20 more dollars!), I figured I could just leave out the old washers and leave the setup like this, which would be spaced about 100mm: 

Or, are there any other inserts that can work with the Deore XT brake shoes that I have? As a side note, there is corroboration that aftermarket replacements for my brake shoes are hard or impossible to find (see here and here, e.g.). 

Replace your hex seatbolt with a knobbed or winged bolt of the same strength and sizing specifications. Clamping knob: Wing screw: 

I want to mount the following SunRace clamp-on shifter set horizontally as a "thumb" shifter on a straight MTB handlebar (22.2mm). I will remove the left lever and only use the right with the clamp. The problem is that the lever is not easy to reach because it swings from parallel with the handlebar to straight forward. I would like to have the angle of the full swing of the lever go from a little towards me to a little forward. Is there an easy way to change the angle of these stem-mount shift levers (which are almost the same as downtube shift levers) by about 45 deg? Note (in second pic) that these are meant for stem mount, so there is a cable housing stop for the part of the shift cable housing that goes from the handlebar to a downtube stop. 

I need to replace the replaceable inserts. However, I am having a hard time finding replacement inserts. Is it possible to slide in "V brake" inserts that are readily available as replacement inserts? For example, could I use the following inserts in the shoes shown above? 

If the road is wide, really empty, safe, with excellent visibility, and maybe even one-way going up, then you might suggest weaving back and forth to make their own "switchbacks". Obviously, this does not apply to riding a shoulder or on busy streets, etc., and so is not widely applicable.
