Well this infograhic puts gas heated by a supernova at about 55 million Celsius. And that's not even the highest temperature we can just "find" out there, even if we discard supernovae and stellar cores. The gas in a cluster of galaxies (the ICM) can have temperatures on the orders of 10 million to 100 million Kelvin. Such a high temperature gas emits high energy photons such as X-rays via bremsstrahlung radiation, and these are observable (and have been observed) by X-ray telescopes. There's this review article from 2003 that covers the basic methodologies and measurements made on ICMs, including (but decidedly not limited to) temperature. 

The question leaves me confused on how to interpret it. As some of the comments have noted, observations have routinely predated a theory that (accurately) predicts them. In astronomy and cosmology this has tended to be the main driving force behind seeking new theories. Yet I sense a more subtle question concerning how scientists would view a theory that predicts everything so far, but nothing new. Ultimately I think there is a confusion concerning the typical mantra for adopting a new theory as the main theory for physics/science/whatever: if a new theory doesn't make any new testable predictions, and so can only reproduce what existing theories already predict, then preference is given to simpler and existing theories. This has nothing to say about a single theory. It's strictly about multiple theories being compared to each other. It does not imply that a theory, viewed entirely on its own, that makes no new predictions is undesirable. It simply means if we're going to replace theory X with theory Y, then theory Y better predict more stuff than X does. It doesn't care if X does or doesn't predict testable things that have yet to be proven/disproven. 

By definition, gravity is a result of mass. Any body with a non-zero mass (even atoms) will have a gravitational field associated with it. The higher the mass the stronger will be the field. This is basic of classical mechanics. Until we reach quantum scale where the gravitational force is dominated by other 3 forces and the gravitational field becomes irrelevent. When it comes to graitational field of asteroids, it exists, but is very weak. However over a course of few million years these small asteroids combine together to form large masses of bodies that we now call planets. That is one of the prominent theory of Solar system formation, where the gravity of small dust particles from first our generation disintegrated star over a course of time accumulated to give us what we now know as our Solar system. Think of it like this, every planet that you see now would once have been an asteroid at some point during its evolution. Another proof to support this is the presence of numerous binary asteroids that orbit each other around a common center of mass, which requires gravitational attraction. 

The solid black orbits are the gas giant orbits, with Jupiter being the innermost one, and Saturn the one after that. The dashed circle represents a 2 AU distance from the sun (modern day Mars is currently at about 1.5 AU, and the modern asteroid belt stretches roughly 2.2-3 AU). This is noteworthy since the model is trying to explain why Mars is so small, and why there is so little material (relatively speaking) in the asteroid belt. The numerous small blue dots are the icy comets/planetesimals that form right around the point Jupiter starts out, and points beyond. The numerous red dots are the rocky asteroids/planetesimals characteristic of the inner solar system. For the first several seconds we see Jupiter creep in towards the inner solar system. You'll notice a lot of rocky planetesimals get scattered out into the outer solar system, while some of the icy ones are scattered to the inner solar system. Indeed, it seems to be a general feature of this model that the total amount of material within approximately 1 AU undergoes a net increase. Saturn is also slowly moving in, but not nearly as quicky as Jupiter is (Neptune/Uranus seem pretty stable, but do "pulse" in and out a bit). 

Based on the scale, the impact events are categorized as harmless, Class-1, to devastating, Class-5. The 440-KT Chelyabinsk event of 2013 belongs to impact hazard class 2, causing regional or local devastation. This was caused by a mere 20 meters wide meteor entering the atmosphere of Earth. For a cumulative number of impacts described for a given reference time interval of $T_{ref}$ = 1Ga ($10^9$ years) which is long enough to statistically include a meaningful number of impacts from all the classesabove, the class 2 impacts cumulative will be $2\times 10^6$ , with small bodies falling in the size range of 20-100 m. Where the characteristic time scale is of $10^2$ a. For class 3-5 events leading to regional disasters to global extinction events, the cumulative number of impacts within the reference interval is $10^4$ with characteristic time scale being $10^5$ a. These events can lead to large devastation ranging from an entire country or region (class 3, with an explosive energy of approximately 104 MT TNT), to mass extinctions (class 5 releasing an approximate energy 108 MT of TNT). An example from the history for such event is the classic K-T extinction events 65 Ma ago that wiped out more than 99% of the living species.

Well, that might depend on exactly what definitions you use. SETI itself is a broad program. In this answer I'll focus solely on what I consider the most iconic part of modern SETI, which is SETI@home. We have the following quote from SETI@home's webpage (emphasis their own): 

Video games think so: $URL$ More generally, we know this can work for stars in a stable way: there are ternary stars where a close binary orbits a large, distant third sun. So replace the binary stars by gas giants, and there you go. And the Pluto-Charon system tells us that similarly sized bodies can orbit each other around a star. So the physics does not preclude the configuration in and of itself. There are the usual problems then with likelihood: gravitational capture is hard, and planet formation is generally expected to be noticeably different from star formation. The latter we can maybe get around: the gas giants are nearly to the brown dwarf stage, so that star formation mechanisms are more applicable. According to the Selected Examples here, Jupiter has density comparable to the Sun, so I would expect this to mean we can scale the binary part of the stellar system to gas giant levels without making the system any more unstable than its stellar counterpart. A precise knowledge of the relevant physics to assert that confidently, and to know if the stability could last for millions or billions of years, is currently beyond me. 

My question is, during the evolution of a solar system is it possible to end up with a massive planet around a star with two small planets around their $L_4$ and $L_5$. Since we know it is not possible to have any bodies around $L_1, L_2, L_3$ due to their low stability, hence any planet trying to evolve their can be easily nudges out of its position. 

Orbits are conic sections therefore can be either circular, elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic. Of these 4, only first two form a closed curve under 2 body hypothesis, while the later two extend to infinity. If you talk about planet, by definition it has to orbit a star which would require it to have a closed orbit hence circular or elliptical, with respect to the star. For any other kind of orbit the body will just fly away to infinity never to return back. Infact comets are considered to be parabolic, but in theory they have highly elliptical orbits with their aphelion lying near the edge of the solar system. But it is possible for a planet to have other kind of orbits if we consider their motion from a different reference frame such as with respect to another planet. So for an inertial frame of reference a planet will have a circular or elliptical orbit, even Pluto. 

The short answer is pela's comment: more mass equals shorter life. For a bit of a longer explanation... The only way the life of the star could be prolonged is if the new material can be transported to the core. This requires convection. Most stars are not fully convective, having distinct layers of either convective or radiative zones. The net effect of the collision in this case is to simply add more mass to the star as a whole while adding no new fuel to the core (or a burning shell); ergo, shorter lifespan. But some stars do (or may) have fully convective stages, such as the main sequences of very small (aka red dwarf) stars and very large stars with enough metals for a dominant CNO cycle. So in such a situation the material of the colliding body would be transported to (and from) the core, giving more fuel to burn. However, the star still has the same, increased mass, regardless of where the "new mass" currently is inside the star, resulting in higher core temperature. The net effect of which is that the increase to the fusion rate exceeds the proportional mass increase. So, shorter lifespan. The basic rule here being that core temperatures are dictated by the gravity well of the star, which is dictated by the mass (and a few other GR contributions, but usually predominantly mass). The more mass, the deeper the well. So adding more mass just means the core (and areas near it) are in a deeper gravity well, meaning the temperatures go up. Stellar fusion reaction rates are approximately non-linear polynomials in the temperature; some go as far as being proportional to $T^{40}$, the 40-th power of the temperature! It's this non-linearity which results in the fundamental relation of the short answer: more mass equals shorter life. Increasing the mass by a given proportion increases the fusion rates by a (much) larger proportion.
