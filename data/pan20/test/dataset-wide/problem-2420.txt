The Nyanaponika Thera translation is a bit more condensed here and uses "fettered" instead of "joined" 

That sounds to me like impermanence, and "rise and fall" does seem to have that meaning in the Visuddhimagga. Here it is in full -- Visuddhimagga XVI: 

addendum -- 2/28 As I said, I am not looking to discuss pros and cons of "mindfulness of brain". I just want to know if anybody is even attempting it. This is a small part of a larger research project on the consequences of current neuroscience for Buddhadharma. In fact, if nobody is doing it, that would confirm a hypothesis. But there are a lot of people drawing connections between neuroscience and meditation, so it's conceivable that someone is attempting "mindfulness of brain". If so, I'd like to know the story. If nobody responds, that's fine. It will be some evidence of non-existence, though obviously not definitive. It's all but impossible to do an online search for this idea because all the conceptual material on neuroscience and meditation gets retrieved first. That's all -- I'm not advocating it. Thanks. 

The origin of 108 in the ancient buddhist scriptures seems to be from the total number of feelings classified in different ways by the Buddha: 

1. How is abstention different from suppression? It is not. Suppression means "preventing the development, action, or expression of (a feeling, impulse, idea, etc.); restrain" 1, so they are actually synonyms. (In case you are referring to the psycho-analytical concept of repression, instead of suppression, then abstinence is indeed different from it since repression is applied in a different context and from a different point of view.) 

So it appears these two meanings can be derived from the word. I think some light can be shed by seeing the word used in another context in which there can only be one meaning due to the nature of it's context (simile): 

Is this common sight to see a refrigerator in a monk's room in Theravada monastery? The few times I've been in a monk's private room, I never saw one. But in the same housing (under the same roof), it's common. 

1. Is the Pali Canon the only canon in modern Buddhism? No. Additionally, as far as I know, there are also many versions of the Chinese Canon which contain the Āgamas (parallels of the Nikāyas from the Suttapiṭaka of the Pāli Canon), Mahāyāna sūtras & Vajrayāna sūtras. There is also the Tibetan Canon which contains the Kangyur (material which is similar to the Chinese Canon) and the Tengyur (Commentarial works, Abhidharma and additional treatises). 2. So would the term canon be completely synonymous with Pali Canon in the context of Buddhism? Bearing in mind what was said above, no. 3. What is the status of texts such as Bodhicaryāvatāra which aren't in the Pali canon? That text is present in the Chinese Canon1 & Tibetan Canon2. 

So, my question -- can folks point me to similar material in the Pali Canon, Visuddhimagga or other non-Tibetan sources. Likewise in Tibetan lineages other than Gelug. 

I am looking for references to any (obviously modern) practices that might be described as "mindfulness of brain" or "meditation on brain" -- using the brain, part of the brain or nervous system, or any neuroscience concept as a meditation object or theme. An example might be using Daniel Goleman's idea of "amygdala hijack" for meditation on fear or other problematic emotions -- thinking about the amygdala during meditation or even trying to visualize it. This might include subtle body techniques (chakras, channels, winds, etc) that make explicit reference to brain or neuroscience concepts (which would be highly speculative, scientifically speaking, but that’s ok for my purposes). I am seeking references to established teachers or meditation systems or programs -- online or in books or papers -- not just ideas about how to do it, or the pros and cons of the notion. I'm also not seeking programs -- which abound -- that talk conceptually about brain or neuroscience but don't integrate that material into specific meditation material or themes. 

How can you use Q&A to gain good Karma and also aid to realize liberation? By reflecting on a few principles when asking & answering: Asking & Answering Notice in what category does the question lie in: 

But it also acquires a moral sense because it is also applied in moral contexts. The next excerpt is an apt example of this: 

I have heard on various occasions that the Buddha slept very little. I was also looking for some specific reference in the literature that can attest to this. One of the most common references in the early texts is the wakefulness (jāgariya) pericope: 

1. What are the ten courses of action & their significance? They are unwholesome and wholesome behaviors that lead people to live unhappily or happily now & in the future. Unwholesome Course Bodily Conduct 1. Killing & harming living beings. 2. Taking what is not given. 3. Sexual misconduct. Verbal Conduct 4. Lying. 5. Slandering. 6. Harsh talk. 7. Useless Idle chattering. Mental Conduct 8. Covetous thinking. 9. Hateful thinking. 10. Seeing distortedly with wrong view. Wholesome Course Bodily Conduct 1. Abandoning killing & harming living beings. 2. Abandoning taking what is not given. 3. Abandoning sexual misconduct. Verbal Conduct 4. Abandoning lying. 5. Abandoning slandering. 6. Abandoning harsh talk. 7. Abandoning useless idle chattering. Mental Conduct 8. Abandoning covetous thinking. 9. Abandoning hateful thinking. 10. Seeing undistortedly with right view. (You can find details about them in the references provided below.) 2. What are their references? You can find them in many discourses throughout the Pāḷi Canon, specially in the 10th book of the Numerical Discourses (Aṅguttara Nikāya). Two examples are: AN 10.176, Cunda (Cunda-suttaṃ) & MN 41, Brahmans of Sala (Sāleyyaka-suttaṃ). 

3149 retweets -- so that's probably where I saw it. As for adding environment to body, that's probably my interpolation, since the material circumstances of one's present life are clearly karmic, according to Buddhadharma. It's probably impossible to trace this to a single origin, however, as it seems to be all over the place in various versions, including from sources other than Buddhists. 

I'd be grateful for references to some of the major Pure Land schools' versions of the Three (or Four) Marks (Seals) of Existence: 

A problem here is that the term "half yoga posture" is not a standard yoga term (according to a web search). But perhaps they meant "half lotus". Here, by the way, is a site showing both, using the names from yoga: lotus and half-lotus -- $URL$ 

Others have nicely explained the different meanings of the two terms. As for their relationship, I'd actually say that samsara and dukkha are the same thing from different perspectives -- samsara from a cosmological standpoint, dukkha from an individual (psychological) standpoint. To be in samsara is to experience pervasive, self-reinforcing (cyclic) dukkha due to ignorance. To be in ignorance is to suffer and hence to be in samsara. So samsara => dukkha and dukkha => samsara, hence samsara <=> dukkha. This is an elementary example of how cosmology and psychology (phenomenology, experience) mirror each other. Rupert Gethin treats this at some length in a great series of papers, though with more intricate concepts. Here it is summarized in the Wikipedia article on samsara. You can look up his papers on the subject, and he also treats it in chapter 5 of his text, The Foundations of Buddhism. You could also add avidya (ignorance) as a third element of the equivalence, perhaps from the philosophical or conceptual perspective. 

I'm not too familiar with Zen literature so I do not know if the term has any additional nuances (Hence the Wikipedia answer. Maybe someone else can jump-in if the term has further subtleties). Thank you for the question though. I didn't know this. 

Where can I read original Jātaka tales online? At Sacred Texts there are 6 translated volumes that contain all of them. 

Technically, it will depend on how one translates it. Either as killing\destroying or injuring\attacking. However, if one takes into account the entire Buddha's teaching it is evident, at least for me, that it means injuring\attacking, not only killing\destroying. So I would say, yes, assault is against the first precept. However, one should always keep in mind that intention is key. One can injure a baby, for example, by extracting from his throat a swallowed toy. In such cases, I wouldn't consider it as against the first precept. 

(Disclaimer: Bear in mind that this answer is structured for the purpose of providing references. This structure is entirely my own way of putting the answer together. I'd emphasize taking the references on their -own terms- without giving too much importance to this structure.) To find a skillful teacher, one could approach the matter prudently by investigating the teacher for the following points: 

If my conjecture is correct, these are what's known in Buddhsim as vajra and lotus position respectively. Even if this is correct, however, it does not address the gender connection. Maybe that is just a Vajrayana (Tantric) convention -- male figures use the vajra position and female figures the lotus position. But even if so, I'm sure there is a story behind it. 

Does anyone know the significance of The Treatise on the Ten Doubts in Pure Land? I cannot find much online. 

The Third Truth indeed says that desire/craving/taṇhā/thirst can be eliminated. But it doesn't say how! It's not easy -- desire is tenacious, self-perpetuating, deeply embedded in our psyche. That's because it is inherently a matter of attraction -- satisfying desire feels good, and we want therefore to repeat it. And every time we do repeat it, it gets stronger. So eliminating desire is not easy -- you can't just wish it away. Anybody who has tried to lose weight or quit smoking knows that well. And eliminating all desire is a lot harder. In general, because you can name and describe a goal does not mean you can "just do it". On the stock market, the old saying is that the trick is "buy low, sell high". Sounds simple. But how to do that consistently fills whole bookshelves, heck, whole libraries. So getting back to the Four Truths -- how to eliminate desire is the Fourth Truth. 

Notice that, in the second watch, sleep (niddā) is not mentioned. It mentions only lying down on the right side in the lion's posture (dakkhiṇena passena sīhaseyyaṃ kappeti). This could be an indication of not sleeping at all and continuing to practice mindfulness while, at the same time, resting the body. On the other hand, the absence of the line "he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check", which is included in the first and last watch, may indicate a less active practice or even sleeping. I'm sure there are more references regarding this theme but I don't recall any additional ones at the moment. 

(Disclaimer: Take this answer as a -means- to explore further and -not- as a definitive answer since the range of descriptions of meditative experiences varies quite a bit from person to person.) 1. What is that feeling called? From what you are describing, I would say it is the ease (Sukha) that comes from a rapturous (Pīti) meditative experience. 2. Is it common after meditation? Yes, I would say it is common and advised by the Buddha to keep developing it. (You may want to see Jhāna for more information.)
