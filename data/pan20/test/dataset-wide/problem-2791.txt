As I read this: Even if r1 and r2 are integers, this idea creates an infinite number of points in space that have names, the (1-D) grid of candidates for object b that puts object b N meters plus-or-minus 1 centimeter away from object a. These points are named things in space, but any physical realization of this naming (labeling the points) would fail, because there can be only finitely many physical objects to assign as names. Numbers have to be something other than an abstract representation of a possible physical labeling scheme. Because they represent a labeling scheme that is impossible to make physical. You need at least a notion of naming that allows for a construction or checking procedure that may need to be executed an arbitrarily large number of times. And that means there has to be more going on than naming as we encounter it normally. Therefore: Physics itself requires concepts that cannot be captured by physical realization and simple naming of objects. As I see it, the argument seems far too obvious to require this level of detail, but overkill forestalls future wasted negotiations... 

What you cite is not the second law of thermodynamics. It is a vague corollary that introduces the undefinable word 'usable'. The law is 'Entropy increases with time" meaning the sub-states of a system become more evenly distributed and not more clustered statistically. There is no reason some use cannot ultimately be contrived for the random lack of contrast that will ultimately result. Much of the entropic heat on Earth maintains the temperature, which keeps my blood from solidifying. And I use it for that. It does not take 'plentiful useful energy' to characterize the initial state away from which all time flows, but rather 'extreme order with little variation'. Your argument holds no sway over the latter, accurate description of what the second law actually predicts. You have, in effect, disproven your own deduction of the corollary from the original by changing the meaning of the undefinable word. 

Nietzche's theory of eternal recurrence (although not really tenable in its details, now that we understand chaos and quantum fluctuation) goes with this position intellectually. Like much of his approach to life, he adopted it partly out of contrarianism, because challenging our wishful thinking is of value in itself. But it does capture a definite practical way to address this conundrum. He assumes this is not one of the first few loops, when the universe was still converging into its set pattern, because if there are infinitely many loops the odds of the one currently in progress being that early in the sequence is incredibly slim. But he also doesn't think that we would have developed the illusion that we can affect things if it had never been true. So there is no determinism, but our current next actions are all fixed beyond our control. Sartre's Existentialism also accepts a notion of freedom that does not accept either free will or determinism, but instead disputes their relevance. Life is an emotional and social process, not a physical one. So what matters is how authentically you approach change, not the physical fact of whether your approach actually alters the outcome. Considering the question is a way of dodging ambiguity and avoiding responsibility for moving forward without knowing what cannot be known. The overall point in both cases is the irrelevance of freedom to reality. So it would be kind of weird to have a name for this position in general. It would convey a sense of attachment, when the point is to detach. 

At a less apologetic level, the math is just bad -- in a way that it is still bad when used by both feminists and traditionalists whenever they speak of women and power. (Sorry, you cannot ask a gender question on the Internet, and expect to escape the MRA point-of-view.) The observation lacks the notion of distribution. The top end of any distribution with a wider standard deviation is going to lie above the top end of the narrower one, at some point, even if the mean of the thinner one is higher. So it is ambiguous whether rulership is a relevant measure of the overall power of a group in a society. More generally, it is deceptive to stratify one's observations within social classes. When they differ, the sexes differ far more in standard deviation than in mean. And it is almost always the women who are clustered closer together. There are more male geniuses and more male morons. More men are large and strong, but more boys die before reaching adulthood (so they are never large) and more men develop terminal illnesses at younger ages (so they are in other ways less strong). Both ends of most measurable spectrums contain more men, with women "more average, on average" across the board, and surviving women better off on average in those respects where one tail or the other of the distribution involves death. So it is with the distribution of power. Women may exert more power over other people's behavior, even in societies where men rule. This can be seen in our own society in the ratio of sexes in prison, and the overall trend that the kinds of crimes we punish most harshly are those it is less natural for women to commit, even though the laws are historically written by men, and often explicitly try to favor them. We look at gender relations from the viewpoint of the working class and those above, by habit, and completely exclude that class that serves primarily as cannon-fodder or beast of burden, never has the benefit of social protections (including marriage), and expects violence as a matter of course. That class simply contains more men. At the same time, in cultures where parents or leaders approved marriages, women were married upward in class, on average, and entered their husband's social class. If unmarried women retain the class of their birth, and a reasonable fraction of married women enter a higher social class, women can be subordinate in every social stratum, and still better off on average, by being very under-represented in the bottom tier of the society. 

Although I respect Ken Wilbur and other transpersonalists, they seem to see evolution as a single track, whereas it is clearly something more complex. It presents to us at least a tree of evolutions, and perhaps a network where traits emerge and fold back together into more complex systems than could evolve in a simple, goal-seeking manner. We have certainly evolved adaptations that allow us to populate a broader range of the planet. So while you may or may not want to consider local adaptations as evolution of the whole species, we do see the process of evolution at work selecting humans for different environments. It is not clear this somehow advances the species as a whole, because they seem to take the form of selective trade-offs. But they allowed us to migrate to areas we could not previously occupy. In the north, for instance, light skin allowed us to move north of the tropics and still have enough Vitamin D (while letting us get more skin cancer). And we evolved the various blood types to resist diseases more often caused by the cold (while creating certain difficulties in childbearing). To the far north, we think we evolved fat accumulation for warmth, and when those same people moved through the far north to the middle of the Americas, we see the same mechanism adapt for long-term survival in regions with extreme seasonal variation (while making for a lot of diabetes currently). So, this presents at least a 'tree' of adaptations that increases our flexibility. Also, there is a good reason not to consider technology as 'evolution', since it can be lost and regained far more easily than atavism can allow physical traits to be lost and regained. Merging these two concepts seems unwise, since they pursue different goals, an currently, to my mind, seem to be trending in opposite directions. We are trying very hard to suspend physical evolution, and to make humans' ability to reproduce more equal, and we see the middle classes worldwide in particular producing fewer copies of their genes in the interest of promulgating more emphasis upon their 'memes'. As they do so they mix those memes in new and interesting ways that change the memes themselves far faster than simply recombining would seem to. I think our framing from most of advanced science, for instance, combines tropes from religions that arose far, far apart (in particle theories alone: spontaneous generation, irreducible indeterminacy, 'vibrations' as forms of matter, 'light' as the basic substance, the horror of emptiness), and generates new concepts entirely from among those combinations, that could not be foreseen in the originals or gotten by simple combination (like quantization of energy as well as matter). I would claim this means our psychical 'evolution' is more of a network where tropes split and merge and present a less atomic model than 'memes as mental genes' allows for. This non-linearity complicates the notion of 'levels' or 'degrees' of evolution beyond a very basic, broad scale. And I think it is best done away with to begin with, since, wherever I have seen it as a trope, it is generally racist or classist in origin. 

In the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics the answer is no, not all random behavior is uncaused. Stripping out the negatives: we know that some behavior is caused by other effects, but still truly random. Schroedinger's equation and boundary conditions together constitute a cause, and the results are distributed in a way that is, at some level, truly random. There is an aggregate trend toward a pattern if you have enough different particles involved. But the behavior of an individual particle has only a distribution of possible responses. Its choice among those will not show any pattern that points to a cause. In a sense that is less tied to interpretation, we have Heisenberg's principle, which implies there is always some level of detail below which you will discern no pattern in any physical interaction. So if you look closely enough, things will meet your definition of random. And this is even true from a pre-quantum-theory point of view, although it requires a little dancing, including idealized calculations we know we can never do in practice. Statistical mechanics requires that one should, in principle, always be able to extract the underlying distribution that explains all of the traceable causes in a system. If you subtract that out, the remaining behavior should be random. The only remaining patterns would be the basic statistical moments resulting from the number of independent agents involved. That means that the behavior of an individual agent would be truly random, if a smallest part could be isolated. Having explained all of its motion does not leave it with no motion, as that is a very distinct pattern, but with random motion. Since we have traced all of the traceable causes, and we do have faith physical motion has causes, there must always be more causes than we can trace. 

I am not sure how this is a philosophy question, but as a psychology question the answer seems obvious. Cognitive dissonance is a real thing. Different parts or layers of a personality can believe opposite sides of a dichotomy, and action or analysis can give one of these influence over the other. As the original Cognitive Dissonance experiments show, one can be made to believe something superficially for social reward that one does not hold at a deeper level. If you are distracted from thinking about it explicitly, acting on the superficial beliefs will cause your internal beliefs to shift toward them. The movement itself proves that both beliefs are in some sense real, and that the underlying mental processes are seeking harmony between them. In fact it is quite common for unconsidered action to be motivated by the wish that one did not believe what one really believes, and attempting to disprove it through reality testing, to the point that it is a stereotype of trite psychology in bad writing -- I am a wimp, so I bluster, but the things I am saying are not false. 

How about a clearer answer from inside biology? Framings like the Gaia movement of James Lovelock would rather see life equally at the level of the individual cell or body and at the level of an entire species, an ecosystem, or the whole planet. If you look at biology from that direction, 'grow and reproduce' is a biased version of the normal biological criterion, colored by our notions of progress. For those larger things, growth may be basically impossible, and reproduction is extremely rare and perhaps pointless. (How would Earth grow? Why would it bother to consider a bigger version of itself better? It surely does not need to beget another planet.) The criterion for living becomes self-directed homeostasis, instead. You can simplify that down to the ability to heal or adapt, rather than to grow or reproduce. The emphasis on systematically displacing entropy (directing energy) for a given goal that arises naturally and is not imposed from outside remains the central part of the definition, the goal itself is just more general. 

Pretending that all he has to do is refute your claim introduces the fallacy of the argument from ignorance. Dismantling a proof does not prove the opposite. Even if he destroyed all of your evidence, denying the force of an argument does not offer any reason to decide in any given way. Given that action and inaction are both decisions, the two of you should adopt the same level of burden: He needs to have a position of his own to argue for doing nothing, given the chance there is global warming. This is the flip side of an answer I have to keep giving with reference to other fallacy questions: Politics is not logic. In politics, there are no necessities, there are only choices between alternatives. If all of the alternatives are logically incorrect to different degrees, that does not stop one of them from being the best option. Some direction, be it action or inaction, will be taken. What direction it is wisest for us to go in the future, and what beliefs should direct those choices, is not a matter of logical, observed, or theoretical fact. Logic relies on some source of premises. And science can only provide those premises on a basis of trust. When it all comes down to brass tax, scientists can only predict things. They cannot know them. That is a fundamental truth of the scientific endeavor. Any time you are using science to make a decision politically, you are not basing your decisions on fact. You are always relying upon the negotiation process that rationalizes scientific results against the data. Every scientific fact is an appeal to authority. So unleashing basic mistrust on science just means you have to work entirely outside the framework of science altogether, or you have to play the odds. Those odds are against the most common counterargument -- that the predicted economic risk of action outweighs the predicted risk of loss due to inaction. Given that the scientists are going to be wrong with a given likelihood, what is the best course? What happens if they are wrong, and we make the changes necessary to avoid catastrophe? Can the countervailing position hold up their predictions of global economic collapse? Of course not, economics is science, too. And a science with a far higher risk of being wrong. Given that it involves humans making competitive decisions, it necessarily involves feedback loops that no one understands. So the two sides of this argument are both science, and it does not matter whether either of them has ultimate proof or even complete consensus. The more likely outcome is still that the majority climatologists are correct and the anti-regulatory half of classical economists are wrong. 

You can note that universal gravitation says that there is no rock that cannot be moved by even the smallest particle. So the answer is that since the size of a rock has nothing to do with the might of the mover, the question is badly framed. The perspective from which it is framed is too Aristotelian, and not realistic enough. This kind of argument falls into the same kind of hole. Since any respectable Supreme Being creates the rules, if you imagine something He cannot do, the problem is with your imagination, not his ability, and that flaw actually serves some purpose.
