Let's ignore the issue of whether you'd ever feel a wave and look at the main question. I'll just consider raw energy in the wave and hope that somehow equates to feeling it. The power output of two orbiting bodies of mass $M$ (assuming the same mass for simplicity), and orbiting at a radius of $r$ is given by $$P_{grav} = \frac{32}{5}\frac{G^4}{c^5}\frac{2M^5}{r^5}$$ Note that $G=6.67\times10^{-11}\:m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$ is the gravitational constant and $c=3\times10^8\:m/s$ is the speed of light. Now $P_{grav}$ is the total power radiated out in energy per second in the form of gravitational waves. You of course would not be experiencing this entire power though because this is radiated in all directions. The power is not radiated spherically symmetrically, but for simplicity's sake, let's just assume it is. That means we can say the power you experience given your area $A$ and distance $d$ from the system is given by $$P_{exp} = P_{grav}\frac{A}{4\pi d^2} = \frac{32}{5}\frac{G^4}{c^5}\frac{2M^5}{r^5}\frac{A}{4\pi d^2}$$ Play with some numbers for this and see what is necessary to have an appreciable power. I will point out though that at the distance you'd have to be where this power became appreciable, it would be overwhelmed by the tidal forces involved. So in short, no I don't think you'll ever be able to feel gravitational waves, no matter the circumstance. 

By definition, the solstice is the exact point in time when the Earth's axial tilt is pointed as close to (or as far from) the Sun as possible and by extension, the Sun is at its highest (or lowest) point in the sky during the year. If you're in the northern hemisphere, this point is the summer solstice, whereas it is the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere. 

As Carl Witthoft already said, atmospheric absorption limits what we can do from the ground. The atmosphere absorbs at important wavelengths and, more importantly, atmospheric disturbances introduce unwanted noise in your data. In a field where clean, noiseless data is paramount, putting something in space to remove those problems is necessary. Earth-based, exoplanet-hunting telescopes are limited by the sky they can see in a few ways. For one thing, no single Earth-based location can view the entire sky so if you really want full coverage, you need these telescopes in multiple locations around the world and that can get expensive. One example of a project like this is the MEarth Project, but there are plenty of other ones. On the whole, a single, multi-camera telescope in space can cover more of the sky, and do so more easily, than an array of telescopes scattered across the planet. Secondly, the idea of being "limited by the sky" also comes into play when you consider that ground-based telescopes are limited by weather and light pollution. A space-based telescope doesn't have these limitations and can more or less view any star at any time (so long as it is not occluded by the Moon/Earth or too close to the Sun). Ground based telescopes are also limited by another factor (that ties into the previous two) which is that they fairly magnitude limited. Most ground-based exoplanet-hunting telescopes are groups of small telescopes which either (a) specifically target nearby, bright stars, or (b) scan the sky, extracting data for only the brightest stars. Neither of these situations is ideal for really being able to look at 500,000 stars as TESS is proposing. For example the MEarth Project I cited above was originally only targeting 1,976 stars! That's far less than TESS's 500,000, and just like MEarth, I'm sure TESS will continue to expand it's operational parameters. Another factor to consider is that there's already numerous ground-based exoplanet-hunting telescopes. However, there's not nearly as many space-based telescopes dedicated to searching for exoplanets. Why limit ourselves and choose to do one or other when we could do both? 

In this diagram there are a few important parts. The first being the singularity. When you put a bunch of mass together, gravity acts to squeeze that mass into a ball. That is what drives the fusion in our Sun and makes our planet round. Normally there is some resistive force that stops the matter from collapsing completely, such as the structural integrity of rocks in the Earth or fusion in the Sun. At some point though, if you pack on enough mass, that resistive force can't hold out and gravity wins. In this case, all the matter collapses down as far as it can go. It becomes a point of matter known as a singularity. This singularity has no size, it is literally (and mathematically) a point. All the mass of the black hole exists here. So when they say a black hole is 20 billion solar masses, they mean that the singularity contains the matter equivalent to 20 billion Suns, all confined to that single point. The other important concept for a black hole is the event horizon. I should stress that the event horizon is not a physical object in space. It is a mathematical boundary. Without getting into the nitty-gritty and in basic terms, the event horizon is where our current physics "stops working". We cannot describe inside the event horizon with our current physics because we are in that region where both QM and GR are important and they don't play well together. The event horizon is also the boundary where, if crossed, you're trapped forever in the black hole. There's a lot more physics involved with the event horizon, but that's the gist. Usually when someone refers to the size of a black hole, they're talking about the event horizon. Thus if they say the black hole is 118 billion kilometers across, they mean that the event horizon has a diameter of 118 billion kilometers. Note, from the image above, that the radius of the event horizon is easily calculated from only the mass of the singularity (and a few physical constants). There are further components to a black hole such as the ergosphere or photon sphere, and often black holes have accretion disks of material around them. I'll leave those concepts to another question though. 

Just for fun, a "stable" 3-body problem with all stars of equal mass and orbits. This is really an unstable equilibrium orbit and any perturbations will screw it up and you'll see what you saw in the above two graphs. In fact, if you run this long enough, the numerical instabilities of my code will result in the orbits breaking down. This numerical instability, as I said above, is inherent in any numerical solution and cannot be overcome, only minimized. I find that, using the numerical method I did, my system is resistant to numerical instabilities for about 7 years. If I want to run this any longer (and continue to be accurate), I need more robust numerical methods. 

There's no clear answer to this, it would all depend on your specific file, which of course we know nothing about. The information you need is likely going to exist in the fits header though (if it exists at all). I'm assuming you're reading your fits file using the package since you're using Python (if not, definitely check it out). If that is the case, you can read all about looking at the fits file headers in the AstroPy documentation. You'll have to look at the header files and scan through to see if any information included with the fits file tells you precisely where in the sky the image is. No image is going to be "circular". Images are taken on square CCDs and thus produce square images of the sky. A "regular" image will be square. 

Check weather and cloud coverage before viewing. A good example might be this map. Even if the sky looks clear, there may be tenuous cloud cover that can obscure viewing for most objects. Get a red flashlight. You'll want to see what you're doing in the dark, but using a normal flashlight, or your phone, will ruin your eyes. To really see fine details, your eyes need to be adjusted to the dark which takes 10-30 minutes. Using a red flashlight to illuminate will prevent your eyes from being over-exposed.
