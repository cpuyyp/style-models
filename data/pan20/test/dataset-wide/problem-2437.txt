Use commentary to translate it: Ānāpānassatikathā in $URL$ For the concentration meditation parts (first 4 parts form 16 parts): 

Anuruddha-mahāsāmi (thai:anuruddhācāriya) was one of ancient saṅgarāja in sri lanka. He author abhidhammatthasaṅgaha, that is popular summary of abhidhamma-pitaka. 

No where in that quote show nihilist wanderers not see 5 khandha as self. That context mean " nihilist wanderers think about 5 khandha (with avijjā and taṇhā that nihilist wanderers never known) as self. And they think that when self die, self will never born again". But the truth is "where is taṇhā, there is born (paṭiccasamuppāda)". However they can't think like that because they never enlighten paṭiccasamuppāda. 

You can see that it is very very hard to success. And all the way, you still will be old and dead after that. So, theravāda buddhism never support whole rebirth and reincarnation. We have jātaka, rebirth cannon, just for an inspiration and faith in buddha's ability and experience. Nowhere you can avoid the suffering, if you still rebirth This image captured from TEACHING & TRAINING book of Pa-auk monastery: 

In abhidhamma, person still has mind's arising until person's citta-ja-rūpa, such as breathe, still going on. But because of karmma (kamma), temperature (utu), and nutrient (āhāra) are not good enough to support mind to done mind's job, such as making-nerve-impulse (citta-ja-rūpa), etc. So, the tool of the scientist can't catch mind's arising of this person. That's the reason why some vegetative state can awake again, after long sleeping. 

In my experience, I studied pāli then recite, memorize, and comprehension some important sutta by myself before decide to translate each word meaning in each sutta. I read commentary directly. I study very simple parts of science, biology, physic, and chemistry. I often make research of the anti-abhidhammist's evidences. So, I still stand by the ancient theravāda tradition with a very strong decision, because I still trying to listen and prove every evidences which I can from every teachers, not just the ancient theravāda tradition teachers, and the best benefit still being in ancient theravāda tradition. 

For the layer of pāli-canons timeframe, please see: What are timeframe were pali canons, included commentaries, done, especially Mahavihara-Theravada? The arguments began from misunderstanding of students/scholars in reading study system, especially from the western world, see The Case of Dhammakaya (Thai: กรณีธรรมกาย) by P.A. Payutto. Reading study system make students/scholars understand teaching discontinuous, incomplete, through the buddhist study course. You can see through below cases that the arguments of buddhist hypothesis by the students/scholars in reading study system, began from misunderstanding. So, there are many misunderstand appearing from the past and still going on now, below. I have the evidences in pāli-canons for each below example, if someone request to me, I will add them to this answer as soon as I can. for the example: (a) The introduction of dhammasaṅgaṇī's commentary, by the tipitaka-memorizers, said: 

Unlimited mettā-mind. Unlimited target people. But limited by situation. The practitioner meditating unlimited mettā-mind by using unlimited target people as object. The practitioner doesn't meditating the sitution such as target people's resultant, target people's kamma, etc. 

Anti-rebirthist = ucchedadiṭṭhi = one extreme. Rebirth-lover = sassatadiṭṭhi = another extreme. Profit-follower = eightfold path = middle way. 

But the beginner students just read through the english translation version of 4 nikāya, which translated only some part, then misunderstood and distort it as "some sutta in 4 nikāya maybe authored after 1st saṅgāyanā". 

So, sakkāya-micchā-anu-diṭṭhi means often mis-understanding, micchā-anu-diṭṭhi (verb act as noun), of sakkāya (object), causes and effects, clinging-aggregates, which is anattā, as attā. See note0 below for more information. 

This topic should not strict in english version only, because the best buddhist book maybe didn't write in english. I recommend paṭisambhidāmagga-pāli by sāriputta. Content: Clearly explanation of every important dhamma, which often appear in sutta, such as ñāṇa, dhammacakkappavattanasutta, vipassanā, pariññā, samatha, sīla, etc. Reasons: Sāriputta is in the middle of budhha, upāli, ānanda, atthakathā, buddhagosa, thai monks, and myanmar monks. So, if you can understand his concept, you can understand the whole theravāda canons. The referene for above reason: 

Samatha practitioner meditating to avoid just kāmadhamma-attachment, such as color-attachment, etc. So, the practitioner should not worry about pleasure-attachment in samatha meditation, because teacher will teach you to meditate insight-meditation to remove pleasure attachment in samatha, again, after you attain jhāna. Therefore, just meditate follow the meditation sequence. 

No, because in tipitaka, buddha and the other ariya never try to suicide. In contrast, ariya still accept chances to keep their life by eating, healing. For the example in vinaya, Buddha still ate, and Buddha ever gave chance to Jīvakakomārabhacca for healing Buddha's body. P.S. Channa-bhikkhu suicide before enlighten. 

Why I translate like that? I combine above titles with their explanation below. Because in ancient theravāda study system culture, sutta's context must relate each others. This is called tanti-bhāsā. 

You can also notice board-ego by the other cetasika, such as dosa, issā, alobha,passaddhi, etc., too.This method is called "cittānupassanā-satipaṭṭhāna". I just write the most important cetasika for this topic. Sadly, people today are so hastily and judge someone according to the appearance. So checking and proving are not important now. In my experience: Almost everyone in every forum often told me to practice myself, such as "you are stroker. you are close-minded." I checking&proving then answer them, that sometime I accepted to develop myself, sometime I asked for the reference, and sometime I explained. But on the contrary, almost everyone didn't call me for reference, accept me to develop themselves, or explained their view. This is very big difference that always show to me from every forum discussion. It is called "open-mined" and "close-mined". 

In Mahādukkhakkhandhasutta kāma-taṇhā, which caving "five strands of sensuality", conditions bhava/vibhava-taṇhā, then these 3 taṇhās condition upādāna-until-jāti: 

Avoid too much food is sila. Less food=Good health. Good health=sukha. Sukha is base of samatha. Samatha is base of vipassana. There are sila samadhi panna. 

Samatha = citta-samatha = Leading to wholesome mind = seclusion of unwholesome in 5 strings, kāmaguṇa. Vipassanā = samatha-vipassanā = Leading to sabbasaṅkhāra-samatha, nibbāna = seclusion of whole 5 clinging-aggregates. So, samatha is for taṇhā-carita (unwholesome often arise), vipassanā is for diṭṭhi-carita (wholesome often arise). People, who can't get the seclusion of unwholesome in 5 strings, should meditate samatha. People who already got the seclusion of unwholesome in 5 strings, should meditate vipassanā. It is not depend on lay or monk, it's depend on each personal ability like I explain above. However, most lays can't get the seclusion of unwholesome in 5 strings, even the seclusion of verbal and bodily actions as well, so Buddha often teach dāna & sīla & bhavanā (samatha&vipassanā) to lay. But there are more monks who have gotten the seclusion of unwholesome in 5 strings, so the buddha often teach sīla&samatha&vipassanā to monk. See: Netti-pakaraṇa. 

There are three study types in alagaddūpama sutta. The pali and it's sequence, of that sutta, same to kīṭāgirisutta, that I re-translated in this answer. By kīṭāgirisutta, you must choose a right teacher, that I answered in this answer. Also, there is a layman-beginner course, in this answer, too. But that course is what the skillful teacher, in this answer, will teach you, so you shouldn't do it yourself alone. Why? Because I have doing it for 10 years, but I still not even achieve appanā-jhānā. In comparison, my current teacher from pa-auk, who just started to study buddhism since 6 years ago. However, he is one of pa-auk teacher now, because he study buddhism from a professional teachers who have all qualities in this answer, from pa-auk. Right way will give you a shortcut way. 

I ask this question because in pali, "to let go (nibbāna)", in this context, is known by monk. It is not just a target. The (ariya) monk thinking of nibbāna in his concentration, in this context. I just wanna make sure that english translation is right, because when I translate that english sentence, by my terrible english, it look like "to let go " and "object" means "target", not "something is known by monk". In the pāli: ārammaṇa means "something is known by consciousness", "something is thought by consciousness", "external sense-fields". It doesn't means target/object. 

This topic is the reason that why saṅgha at 1st saṅgayanā arrange tipitaka content like that. Because they realize to keep lifespan of buddhism. See ruben2020's answer above. For pali source. In my opinion, I think this is sāriputta-aggasāvaka's teaching because he authored saṅgītisutta, and abhidhamma. Also this comment appear in ānanda's, and sāriputta's commentary, too. Vinaya pitaka, cuḷavagga, bhikkhunikhandhaka: 

0.1. We shouldn't angry anyone, even though that one is not ariya. 0.2. Upavada is blaming by angry. See Sutta. Aṅ. (2): catukkanipāto Bhayavaggo tatiyo [121] Attānuvādasuttaṃ . 

It is very easy to attach music. Then music will waste practitioner's time, because music is inserted into practitioner's mind instead of meditation object, while the practitioner listening/singing/thinking of a music. So the practitioner's 5 power can not meditate, increase level up, while attaching music. While listening music, one can feel joy. But it is the worldly joy [sāmissa=5 cords+5 hindrances]. So, it will hinder one from meditation. therefore, according to Niramisa Sutta, the practitioner can increase his meditation level up, just after he can perfectly & completely quite secluded (=stop) from sāmissa, such as music, etc.
