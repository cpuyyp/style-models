Reverse curls are done with the palm down. They primarily work the brachialis and the brachioradialis. Hammer curls are done with the the palm facing inward. They work the biceps brachii, the brachialis, and the brachioradialis more equally than the other two positions. The standard curl is done with the palms facing up. They primarily work the biceps brachii. 

Squat down with your feet flat on the ground, your back almost swayed in a neutral position, and your elbows on your quads a few inches above your knee. Without changing the position of your hips or arms, slowly straighten your legs at the knee. Try it...it works. 

For your quads and glutes, you can vary your squat stance between close to wide from week to week. Adding weighted lunges would be a movement that will target your glutes a little more. Plyometrics are also a great way to target fast twitch muscle groups and you can hit lots of different angles this way. I also thought that a row movement for the back was missing. What do you mean by "incline dumbbell raise" for the serratus? Did you mean a dumbbell pullover? 

In my experience, runner's high is only obtained after you "hit the wall" and get your "second wind". You have to run past the wall and hit a second wall before you get "runner's high". I always thought it was a result of the release of endorphins. In order to reach a runner's high faster, you have to run at a high level of intensity for an extended period of time. The more you train, the better level of conditioning you reach, which means you have to continue to push yourself even harder to reach a real runner's high. Evolutionarily, I think it's a survival mechanism. It allows you to push past all feedback from your body that tells you to stop, and continue anyway. 

In general, I don't think that whether you're hungry or not is relevant at all. Just because you're hungry doesn't mean that you don't have sufficient glycogen stores for a run. If you are hungry, the hunger will probably subside once you start running as exercise causes you to have an increase in insulin. Any increase in insulin is followed by a low, at which point you'll feel the hunger return. This may be after you're run, or if you're exercising for a longer period, it could be before your workout is over. Cardio for weight loss is often suggested to be done first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, that way you will start burning stored glycogen immediately, and if you're eating a low carb diet, possibly go directly to burning fat for energy. Again, whether you're hungry or not is still irrelevant. If you just ate, you will burn sugar in the bloodstream first when you run. Depending on your metabolism, and how long since your last meal, you might not even digest that last meal yet because blood will be pulled to the extremities during your run, and away from the stomach in order to supply oxygen to the muscles working during exercise. 

If you want to lose weight, the bottom line will always be calories, so if you're eating extra carbs to help with your runs, you'll have to eat less calories to balance it back out. As was already stated, fats aren't as readily available for energy as carbohydrates, so they are ideal for low intensity exercise like walking and doing normal daily activities. I am a bodybuilder (used to be a runner) - The most important time for a bodybuilder to take in carbohydrates is post workout because when the body is depleted it needs to absorb nutrients like amino acids. Carbohydrates increase insulin levels which in turn increases the body's ability to uptake nutrients. So, bodybuilders take in protein with carbohydrates post workout. The second most important time for bodybuilders to take in carbs is pre workout for all the same reasons that a runner takes in carbs before their workout. Disclaimer...The following is just my loose interpretation of what's going on in your body during a run. When you take off for a run and are full of nervous energy and maybe a little jumpy, you're running on sugar in the bloodstream. That doesn't last very long before you "settle into a pace" and start burning glycogen that is stored in your muscles when you eat carbohydrates. When a runner "hits the wall" it feels like a sudden loss of energy as if you can not possibly go any further. I believe this to be the point at which glycogen has become depleted. If you push past the wall and maintain a strong pace despite all the signals your body is telling you, you'll "get your second wind". At this point, I believe your body has transitioned from burning glycogen to metabolizing protein for energy. When exercising at a high intensity, fat is not as efficient an energy source as muscle tissue, so it is not likely that fat is being burned primarily. Sometimes you can "hit the wall" again. If you continue to push past that for very long and get a third wind, you'll get "runner's high" which is your body releasing endorphins because that's all you have left to run on. I miss runner's high. 

I've been buying the DVDs and seminars of Cressey and Robertson and their friends - all functional sport trainers and rehabbers. Now that you mention it, I don't recall them doing any calf exercises like a body builder would do (various kinds of calf raises). There is plenty of ankle mobility work, however. Cressey has routines where weight exercises are super setted with a mobility - e.g. a heavy squat set followed immediately with a scapular wall slide, rest, repeat. I've done calf work for body building in the distant past and they take a lot of time (>20 minutes) and effort (more weight than you can squat) and special equipment (body building/Golds gym is full of that stuff), but I still have great looking calves and most people don't. Look at Cressey Show and Go and Robertson Single Leg Solution and Assess and Correct by Mike Robertson, Eric Cressey, and Bill Hartman to not see much isolated calf work, but you will see integrated leg work and joint mobility. Mark Verstegan has Core Performance which also integrates muscle exercises and joint mobility. Mike Boyle is another noted strength and conditioning coach. These guys are big in baseball, soccer, and hockey. 

Practical Programming for Strength Training by Rippetoe & Kilgore is written for strength and conditioning coaches including power lifting teams so it applies to athletes in strict training programs. In a section called "Going Backward: Detraining" he says that strength persists much longer than aerobic VO2 max...ability to generate force drops in a few weeks...drops at about 15% per year...returning after 2-6 months, the trainee should drop one level e.g. an intermediate lifter should restart with novice programs (he defines these terms strictly) until his strength returns to pre-layoff levels, which will occur faster than the time it took to become intermediate (this is true for size as well). He strongly cautions coaches/trainers to not "get greedy" in that even an athlete who's just turned intermediate has a neuromuscular system far more efficient than the untrained individual and though it's weakened it is still able to work the detrained muscles harder than they can handle. This is what Dave, FredrikD, and YYY have already said in their comments, I just wanted to put a reference in an answer for those who want to pursue these issues further. Interestingly for me at least, he then goes on to discuss the returning 'retired' lifter, someone who's taken a year or more off. Here he suggests restarting with novice level programs regardless of pre-layoff level. 

I'm surprised no one has mentioned supersets, an ancient and honorable practice in which you do a set of one exercise then immediately do a set of another, rest and repeat. Supersetting 3 exercises is not uncommon. One kind of superset is the leg extension - lat pulldown type. It is done for time efficiency since you get to skip a rest period. Is your performance reduced? Probably. For sure if you're not in great shape or not using steroids. But if today's workout is chest and you do all your benching first, so what? The oddest kind of superset is the dumbbell curl - lat pulldown type. Here you're trying to take your biceps out of the back work, or paradoxically, you're hoping the pulldowns will extract the last bit of bicep strength. The most sophisticated superset is something I recently learned from Eric Cressey's Show and Go where an exercise is paired with a stretch or mobility exercise. As you can see, this is an advanced approach in every sense. All your energy systems need to be well developed and you need to know the primary and secondary muscles used by each exercise. If you're asking the question, you probably aren't ready, but the fact that you came up with it shows a creative mind that will take you far. 

I saw some rock climbers train in my gym. They were really wiry with big chests. By wiry I mean small but highly defined arms and legs. This was in Japan, so maybe it's genetic or they were professional competitors, but people said they were training for max strength at the lowest possible weight. Starting Strength can really pack on the pounds for a young (under 25) novice lifter. I'd say drink lots of milk, lift heavy and get big and strong while you can - it can't hurt (unless you're rock climbing). Seriously, a power lifter might be able to climb higher than his conditioning will let him climb down. As you become less novice in both activities you may have to make some hard choices. But nothing is set in stone (unless you're rock climbing). 

Like Greg said... Most ab exercises target slow twitch muscle fibers, so they can be trained on a daily basis. However, since slow twitch muscle fibers have a greater propensity to grow, they might not be what you want to target in order to get a 6 pack. Nonetheless, without decreasing your body fat, the sculpted abs will never show. When training abs, you need to remember to target the muscle group at several different angles in order to work every part of the core. 

First of all, nobody takes these body charts seriously. They are intended for bodybuilders in contest shape, so they do not apply to many people. Without a visual, it's hard to say for sure, but I bet you tend to carry more weight in your lower body. I say this mostly because of the measurements for your waist and calves. That being said, I think your thighs are not too big, but too fat. These measurements are only good comparisons if you're very lean. Also, most people don't carry much fat in their forearms. Your forearms are significantly smaller than this charts ideal, even more than your biceps. That indicates that you carry much less muscle than what this chart references. Shoulder development is limited by your trap strength, and your trap size is reflected in the neck measurement. According to the old military height and weight requirements, if you were over the suggested weight for your class, they would measure your neck. If the neck measurement was big enough, it indicated that you carried more muscle mass than the average man, and so your additional weight could be waived. I don't think you should strive to have the same measurements as this chart, but the same proportions as the chart. You should be the same percentage smaller then each measurement. 

I'm surprised to see that there is such a debate concerning types of fats. I don't think there are really different opinion camps on this. The following is not nuance. It is just the same information that you'd get if you asked any personal trainer or bodybuilder this question. Saturated fats are from pigs, cows, and egg yolks. Saturated fats are saturated with hydrogen atoms. They are a very stable molecules that do not react very readily in the body, and are more difficult to access for energy, so they are more likely to be stored for later use. These can be stored where ever your body stores fat and can also be stored along artery walls, and can cause heart disease. These types of fats should be limited. Fats in red meat and pork products should be limited, but that does not mean it's necessary to eliminate all red meat and pork products rather limit the fat content by choosing lean cuts of these meats. Also remember that dairy products that are not fat free contain a considerable amount of saturated fats. Primarily cheese, even white cheeses contain a lot of saturated fat and should be minimized. Although some people eat cheese as a protein source, I do not believe it should be considered as such. The amount of calories from fat in cheese is well over half even in a low fat cheese. Egg yolks have notable amounts of cholesterol in addition to saturated fat. Cholesterol has been credited with increasing levels of testosterone, so it may be worth taking in a moderate amount for this purpose. Unsaturated fats are from fish and plant sources. They are called essential fatty acids because your body does not make them on its own, so you have to take them in through your diet. Unsaturated fats have fewer hydrogem molecules than saturated fats, so they will contain one or more double bonds which makes them a polarized molecule thus more reactive in the body. This means your body can break it down more readily to use it for energy. Polyunsaturated fats are unsaturated fats that have 2 or more double bonds. In addition, unsaturated fats can combine with saturated fats and pull away a hydrogen atom converting it to an unsaturated fat. In this manner unsaturated fats can help you both burn stored fat and break down fatty acids in the blood stream for a healthier cardiovascular system. I suggest taking in unsaturated fats at least once or twice a day. The best sources are nuts and plant oils including peanuts, almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, flax oil, etc. You'd be hard pressed to eliminate saturated fats completely from your diet because most unsaturated fats have some amount of saturated fats in addition and vise versa. You just have to read labels and consider how much you are getting of one compared to the other. I should also include a note about trans fats which are a chemically created form of saturated fats. Trans fats should not just be limited but avoided completely. They have been proven to not only increase bad cholesterol, but to decrease good cholesterol. Trans fats can be found in icings, cooking lard like crisco, and many processed foods because they also act as a preservative.
