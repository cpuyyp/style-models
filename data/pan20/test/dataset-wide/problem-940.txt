You could use gridded model forecasts or reanalysis data to calculate the total water that precipitated. Mathematically, the quantity you desire can be expressend by $$Q=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\Big[\iint\limits_A R(x,y,t)dxdy\Big]dt=\iint\limits_A P(x,y)dxdy$$ where $R$ is your precipitation rate, $P$ is your accumulated precipitation, and $Q$ is your desired quantity. One possible way of computing that quantity (In a crude Riemannian method): 

First you need an area where temperatures change drastically with distance, generally with cold air to the north, and warm air to the south. Up high in the atmosphere, a small disturbance of winds push the cold air towards the warm air (creating a cold front) and the warm air towards the cold air (creating a warm front). As the warm air advances, the pressure decreases. 

This is only to address the title question. You are right, in a way. I would recommend that you set an if statement up such that 

Have there been any air quality modeling studies regarding the locations where ozone is considered "NOx limited" (increasing NOx increases ozone) or "NOx sensitive" (decreasing NOx increases ozone)? The larger the domain of the study, the better. 

I haven't come across the vertical p-velocity, so I am unsure what that is trying to communicate. w is the vertical velocity with units of length per second. Travelling away from the surface means that w is positive. Omega is the vertical velocity in pressure coordinates (so positive omega is negative w). Omega has units of pressure per time. Because much of the operational meteorology uses pressure surfaces, omega is a more common quantity to see. 

There are a number of causes, for a variety of scales. Generally speaking, you can boil it down to convergence/divergence, as a continuity of mass problem, or buoyant motion. You can refer to the vertical component of the Navier Stoke's equations. $$ \frac{Dw}{Dt}=\frac{∂w}{∂t}+\vec{v}\cdot\nabla w + w\frac{∂w}{∂z} =-\frac{1}{ρ}\frac{∂P}{∂z}-g+\nu\nabla^2w $$ Additionally, it must also be constrained by the conservation of mass. $$ \frac{∂P}{∂t}=-\nabla\cdot(\rho\vec{v}) $$ The Quasigeostrophic Omega Equation may also provide you some insight. This equation is filtered down from the above Navier-Stokes equation, though it may not seem like it. Omega is vertical velocity in pressure coordinates. $$ (\nabla^2+\frac{f_0^2∂^2}{\sigma∂\Phi^2})\omega=\frac{f∂}{\sigma∂p}(\vec{v}\cdot\nabla(\frac{1}{f_0}\nabla^2\Phi+f)) + \frac{1}{\sigma}\nabla^2[\vec{v_g}\cdot\nabla(-\frac{∂\Phi}{∂p})] $$ 

Baroclinic- density is a function of both temperature and pressure : $\rho(x,y,z,t)=\frac{P(x,y,z,t)}{R_dT(x,y,z,t)}$ Barotropic- density is a function of only pressure : $\rho(x,y,z,t)=\frac{P(x,y,z,t)}{R_dT_0}$ 

However, these simple, yet often used and powerful definitions miss something important- the effect of water vapor. To get around this, often meteorologists make virtual temperature, that is $$T_v(x,y,z,t)=T(x,y,z,t)[1+\epsilon q(x,y,z,t) ]$$ where $q$ is the mixing ratio and $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the molar mass of water vapor to the molar mass of dry air. Incorporating this into the definition of baroclinic is easy: $\rho(x,y,z,t)=\frac{P(x,y,z,t)}{R_dT_v(x,y,z,t)}$ Incorporating this into a barotropic assumption however, is difficult. What would the approach be? I would consider this important conceptually for the tropics, where the barotropic assumption is most often made, but is mostly covered in water. 

Not to the best of the my knowledge. Such a thing is called dark matter, which is almost undetectable. None of it exists in our atmosphere, at least that we know of. 

You can try the CFSR, a model reanalysis of climate, from 1979 to 2010, or you could use model data, such as the GFS for more recent data inquiries. CFSR: ftp://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/CFSR/HP_time_series/ GFS: ftp://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/GFS/Grid4 The data is in a very raw format (called grib/grib2), that I'd do some research on before you use this data. 

What is the most important factor? That really depends on where you are. When discussing atmospheric dynamics (which covers wind and forces), without making assumptions, you will rarely get a definitive answer. 

There is a WRF domain Wizard offered by ESRL. You can download it here. Also, don't make the same mistake I made using Lambert Conformal- keep stand_lon the same as your ref_lon. 

MetEd from NCAR has a good encyclopedia of models that summarizes some weather models. Of course, when models update, such as the GFS dynamical core being converted to the FV3, or changes in data assimilation systems, they may not be up-to-date. This also doesn't have ALL weather models, but some of the more common ones. Of course, there are models missing from the encyclopedia, such as the SREF, GEFS, the JMA model, the Panasonic weather model, any iteration of the WRF model, statistical post-processed models, etc. 

and generally, I think this is accepted. Why? The vorticity equation $$\frac{D\vec{\omega}}{Dt}=\vec{\omega}\cdot\nabla\vec{u}-\vec{\omega}(\nabla\cdot\vec{u})+\frac{1}{\rho^2}\nabla\rho\times\nabla P$$ describes that convergence (decreasing area, $\nabla\cdot\vec u<0$) leads to increasing vorticity. Does this mean that the strongest tornadoes don't have the greatest vorticity, or am I missing something? 

So the Mean Sea level pressure is defined (simply) as the pressure of the station, corrected to sea level. However, methodological problems occur over terrain, such as assumptions that may not be true. A common method used to correct the pressure is called the barometric equation. One assumption, for example, is that the mean temperature of the previous 12 hours is used to determine the average temperature of the imaginary atmosphere (where the terrain actually is). Of course this generates problems, such as the idea that the mean temperature used is not representative, the lack of lapse rate information, etc. These problems can yield to extraordinary MSLP gradients that may or may not actually exist in reality. 

If I understand your question correctly, you are asking why air inside is usually cleaner than air outside, especially if it is smokey. Smoke is actually not a gas, but solid particles that are suspended. Because of this, the smoke particles fall down, but at a very slow rate due to resistance. When the air is blown against the wall, the smoke can either blow around the wall, or it can be deposited into the wall (think of dust build-up). Of course, smaller particles can negotiate the curve easier, so it isn't perfect. A house is (generally speaking) four walls, so if smoke was blowing against your house, even the small particles that could go around a solitary wall would be blocked off by the walls on the side of the house. As the other answers suggest, a house generally isn't perfectly cut off (hermetically sealed). This means that small openings in your house can let air and let the smallest particles of smoke in. For other reasons, that is good and bad. If too much smoke is brought in, it is hard to get out (consider a cigarette smoker inside). For example, furniture acts as a capacitor of smoke, gradually releasing it in time. In your case, consider you open your doors a bit and some smoke got inside. The smoke will diffuse throughout your house and settle into the floor. Assuming the mass of the puff of smoke is much less than the mass of air inside your house, the concentration of smoke inside your house will likely be negligible. There are a number of different ways you can slow smoke down from entering into your house. Besides the ways listed above, building an anteroom may also prevent smoke from entering and make your house a bit more energy efficient. 

The easy answer is to use finite difference. Which one is entirely your choice. For example, I'll choose a simple centered difference scheme. You say you have a grid, and your point ($x$,$y$) is at the ith and jth gridpoint, where i indicates the left-right index on the grid and j indicates the north-south index on the grid. Therefore $u$ and $v$ can be expressed as $u(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})$ and $v(x_{i,j},y_{i,j})$. $$\frac{du}{dx}\approx\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}=\frac{u(x+\Delta x,y)-u(x-\Delta x,y)}{\Delta x}=\frac{u(x_{i+1,j},y)-u(x_{i-1,j},y)}{x_{i+1,j}-x_{i-1,j}}=\frac{u_{i+1,j}-u_{i-1,j}}{x_{i+1,j}-x_{i-1,j}}$$ A similar process can be applied to the v component, just change the index, and the variables 

It seems like that particular website is a commercial forecasting website and requires login/registration information, so I will take your word for the output. The general equation of motion is described by the Navier-Stokes Equations, which is $$\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t}+(\vec{u} \cdot\nabla)\vec{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla P+g\hat{k}+\nu \nabla^2\vec{u}+f\hat{k}\times\vec{u}$$ where $\vec{u}$ is the atmospheric motion vector (wind + vertical motion), $\rho$ is density, $P$ is pressure, $g$ is gravity, $f$ is the coriolis parameter, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. This very complicated equation currently has no analytic solution (if you have one, you can win $1,000,000 from the Clay Mathematics Institute), but is instead discretized and solved using even heavier mathematics. Additionally, some mathematical tricks are played on the equations to 'simplify' them, but it usually results in other problems. While 8 km seems like a fine scale, it actually isn't. Smaller phenomenon (called eddies) affect the weather significantly, so research that tries to mimic the effect of those eddies is applied, but there are still problems. Cutting edge research tries to reduce that 8 km (called resolution- think of the resolution of your television) down to tens of meters, but at a significant cost- one that limits the domain. Likely, the data that your website comes from a weather model, which attempts to solve the above equation. Such models could include the ECMWF, GFS, and other global models. 

I know that smog is generally a mixture of various chemicals, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and ozone. I also know that smog obscures visibility. My question is two-fold: 

The Barotropic vorticity equation is insufficient to model rain. Part of this is due to the word 'Barotropic,' which indicates a lack of thermal gradient. The other reason is that while vorticity is a useful quantity, it lacks explicit information on the atmospheric state. The primitive equations are a system of partial differential equations that are used by most numerical weather prediction models to model various quantities. Rainfall rate is a parameterized variable, a diagnosed formula (or formulas) based on atmospheric state, based on research. Sometimes the results of the research can give wildly different answers given the same data, which is a weakness of parameterizations. The idea is to model the Reynolds-averaged primitive equations and intermittently invoke the parameterizations (including turbulence, radiation, cloud cover, and so on). Here is a good book that discusses parameterization schemes in general. 

In addition to the answer posted by Jack, there is also buoyancy that must be accounted for. By shear force, six inches of water will sweep you off your feet. Effectively what could happen is the same as taking a dive into a shallow water slide- possible head injury and the possibility of drowning, alongside being swept away. Those same six inches may flood your car. One foot of water, even stagnant water, will float your car. If the water is rapidly moving, I'd hypothesize it may even roll your car, maybe even carry it off. An EF2 tornado has wind speeds of 111-135 mph and can lift cars off the ground, but might not be thrown. An EF3 tornado, with wind speeds between 136-165 mph, will throw cars. Very few people are foolish enough to drive into tornadoes (the tornado interceptors are an exception- they have proper equipment). The same can't be said about floodwaters. I've seen people drive through unsafe waters during a rain storm and have their cars stall in the middle of the road. 

The other answers are correct on the subjectivity of "better." They are also right, in that the answer you may get will depend on your application. My answer is yes and no. Yes: There is a way to convert from latitude-longitude coordinates, but it depends on the projections. Python has become my favorite tool for programming and creating plots, especially maps. Specifically the Basemap module. See some examples. Careful reading of the examples show that it can transform latitude and longitude coordinates into X,Y coordinates (in meters): . No: The flaw with such a system is that the Earth is not flat; it is round. Say your point (0,0) is your left-top corner and (R,0) is your right-top corner. They are the same exact (or nearly exact) point, but on a map, they are a distance R away. This is why Greenland and Antarctica look so large on the Mercator projection. 

Unfortunately, there aren't too many places with archived data is a visually appealing manor. One reason for that is that there is enough data for just forecasting, that it is hard to keep up with it. 

So meteorology is unique in that it changes depending on the scale and process. For a general taste of meteorology, I suggest Wallace and Hobbes. You may note similarities among most of my recommendations, but that may just be a bias from my personal experience. One of the most problematic elements of meteorology is atmospheric dynamics. A common resource is Holton's book. For thermodynamics, a common book used in my undergraduate studies was Bohren and Albrecht. Although you may have experience in thermodynamics, atmospheric thermodynamics is often treated differently, with different quantities. You may recognize some of the equations used, but the variables derived are used throughout atmospheric science. For mesoscale (medium-sized) meteorology, Markowski and Richardson have a good book. For atmospheric radiation, Petty has a basic book. In my synoptic meteorology class, we were assigned this book, but I don't recall ever really using it. This book looks more comprehensive (in fact, I might get it for myself). For boundary layer meteorology, try Roland Stull's book. 

The answer before me is correct, but that is not the only reason why digital filters are used. After the data assimilation procedure occurs, the resulting model state may not be in equilibrium. For example, if geopotential height (or surface pressure) is updated in the assimilation procedure, but wind is not (or vice versa), then the assimilated fields are out of quasi-geostrophic balance. This can also be applied to the hydrostatic approximation. Being that the resultant fields are out of balance, gravity waves may occur in the model, but may not actually occur physically. The digital filter reduces most of these gravity waves. If you have a Met Ed account, this will help explain $URL$ 

You are correct, the atmosphere cannot ever be barotropic. It is important to note that the ideal gas law is relevant only as a state equation; it does not describe the gas as a whole. The barotropic assumption effectively states $P=\rho RT_0$. Effectively, it says "hold temperature constant" You may note this is particularly important when discussing the hydrostatic and hypsometric/barometric equations. On that note, the atmosphere is never entirely barotropic; the atmosphere cannot undergo entirely adiabatic motions; the wind can never stay geostrophic, etc. There are assumptions that are bad, and we know they are (take a class in micrometeorology dealing with similarity theory). But in the words of George Box, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." These simple models teach us about basic atmospheric behavior. It is also worth noting that the ideal gas law is not the only equation of state. The Boussinesq and anelastic approximations can lead to interesting other formulations of the equation of state. 

One side of the world would become warmer and warmer, as the other side cools. Therefore, the pressure on the side of earth with the sun would rise and the pressure of the dark side would decrease. With the ever growing change in pressure, the winds will increase to try to move the high pressure (warm) air toward the lower pressure (cool) air. 

The (relatively) easy answer is that the mechanism that low pressure systems generally form are different than the mechanism that high pressure areas form. This begs the question "How do low pressure systems form?" I'll label the steps of the "Norwegian Cyclone Model" in brief layman-speak. 

No. Consider water vapor. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas. As the temperature increases, more water is evaporated. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the temperature will increase. Clouds, however, form from water vapor, reflect sunlight. The earth is not as linear as people would like. 

Such a dataset can be found via the NCDC. Here is the main gateway. My 'go to' place for high temporal resolution data from NCDC is the 5-minute ASOS data. 

In meteorological terminology within dynamics, there are usually one of two unique assumptions made: 

Calculate $u$ and $v$. This site has formulas for $u$ and $v$. They are as follows: $$u=-|\vec{v}|\sin(\frac{\pi}{180}\phi)$$ and $$v=-|\vec{v}|\cos(\frac{\pi}{180}\phi)$$ where $\phi$ is the wind direction in the meteorological system, and $|\vec{v}|$ is the wind speed. Having calculated $u$ and $v$, you can plot the wind barbs by following the example found at this site.
