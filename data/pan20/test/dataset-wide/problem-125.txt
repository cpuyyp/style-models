A world in which sources of power are not portable. Imagine a biosphere very different from Earth. For instance, the surface of Europa. Both fuel and oxidizer are available for power generation but only from rare spots on the crust at which some of the liquid water can reach the surface. The creatures living on these chemicals wants to get work done at some distance from these "food wells" but doesn't have any other means of converting that chemical energy into useful work for other things. The "food wells" would create life oases in the middle of the barren landscape, somewhat similar to how water wells in the very arid regions create life oases in our deserts. 

From a Hard Physics perspective, what you ask is exceedingly difficult to do. I'm going to approach this from a hard physics perspective which means telling you some of what you want isn't possible or realistic. However, since you're writing a fictional book, you may include rational or McGuffinite to make what you want acceptable in your universe (e.g. a no AI social taboo?). References There's a very long and currently still on-going discussion over at Rocket Punk Manifesto about what "realistic" space combat might look like (please read the WHOLE thread on this - this is just the first entry). I happen to agree with most of the conclusions but strongly disagree with one of them (the NO stealth rule). I also highly recommend studying at great length the website Atomic Rockets section on Tactics Throw out some standard tropes Some of the standard SF tropes that are highly unlikely in a Universe with "realish" physics. In no particular order: 

Radiation shielding. Mass to counter (some of) the pressure of the atmosphere A thermal reservoir to help mitigate some of the extreme temperature swings from the 28 day long light/dark cycle. 

We don't really know The recent development of our current digital environment (commercial use of the internet dates back to roughly 1980 - which also coincides for the approximate start of home computing), means that we haven't really had an opportunity to test their long-term viability (essentially we can't even test the digital data standards & storage methods for more than about 35 years because they simply haven't been around longer than that). But, currently all of the standard storage mechanisms that we use today are only expected to remain viable for from a few years to a few decades (this includes so-called archival media like optical disks and data tapes). So far we've never encountered a need for extremely long duration archiving of data, so no one has ever bothered to design a system to work for that situation. If the scientists and engineers in your story had a few years of warning, they could probably develop something that would work. I do not know how it would look but, based upon experience with various methods, I can guess. But maybe we can guess The F-15 originally was built with "primitive" magnetic core memory. This type of memory is non-volatile and highly resistant to EMP and other things (like cosmic rays) that can damage the data stored in modern memory. However, it is much slower and bulkier than modern memory. 

Spread through airborne (really aersolized) vectors Short incubation time until contagious Long incubation time (weeks or months) from being contagious until symptoms appear 

I'm going to split this into two answers because I think there are two implied questions. Would an AI do a good job *serving* in political office? A: It depends An AI would probably have better access to information and better ability to process quantitative data. However, an AI would be subject to the same prejudices and assumptions that a human would. Furthermore, some of the most objectively intelligent presidents did a terrible job (e.g. Jimmy Carter). The proposed reason for this is that such presidents tend to micromanage more and not ensure they are surrounded by competent people. Surrounding yourself with smart successful people is a better strategy than trying to do it all yourself. So it depends upon how the AI ran its government. Would an AI do a good job *running* for political office? A: I don't think so In democracies and republics, the voters too often elect likable or attractive candidates and not the candidate best suited for the job. Unless the AI were able to create and maintain an avatar on the right side of the "uncanny divide", then it would tend to "freak out" the voters. 

Any form of FTL (including those mentioned in other answers) will also lead to time travel and several interesting novels by physicists like Stephen Baxter (Manifold: Space) explain how they can be used in this capacity. Example Here's more information both as reference and a thought exercise. Creating a "time machine" from a stable wormhole: 

During the transition first the magnetic poles begin to wander and the Earth's magnetic field gets weaker (really the amount of energy in the field remains constant but there's a lot of chaotic effects going on that counter the over all dipole of the Earth's magnetic field). During the magnetic field lull, the Earth's net magnetic field is so weak that you could see aura from any point on Earth. During the field reversal, the net energy of the Earth's magnetic field remains constant. However, the net magnetic field weakens to almost nothing as smaller dipole and quadrapole fields interfere with each other (as if there are innumerable eddies in the liquid core, each generating its own field and interfering with the others).

NOTE: I am NOT answering the asked question But I thought I could provide you with highly valuable information for your story so I'm submitting this as an answer but to a question you never asked. For your handwavium magic material with freaky weird properties, you might check out Negative Matter. Negative matter is NOT anti-matter. Awesome Engines 

Consider a human society in the early 2000s that has been experimenting with the development of AI. It succeeds. Eventually that AI turns on its human developers and wins. Then the AI discovers that no matter how hard it tries, it cannot figure out how to develop another truly intelligent AI. It decides to rerun the process humans used to create it so that it can learn the secrets of creating new AI. It forms the Matrix, a giant simulation of the environment in which humans successfully created a true AI. The master AI rounds up all human survivors and plugs them into the Matrix. The Matrix AI keeps running through the simulation until it gets the results that it wants and learns how to create more AIs. A topic not explored by the movies is that such an AI would, by necessity, completely control the human reproductive cycle. It would be deciding which human DNA to mix and match. Which leads to the interesting philosophical twist that humans developed their downfall (the Matrix AI), while the Matrix AI bred its own downfall (Neo).
