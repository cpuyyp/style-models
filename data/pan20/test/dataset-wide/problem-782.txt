Finally, from Uranus and Neptune the orbital distance might be sufficient enough that parallax could be observed though the effect would still be small, but possibly observable, you might see, from the proper angle, some slight wobble of near-by stars like Alpha Centauri or Sirius. That's the gist. Whether you call the Sun's apparent motion "approximately circular" is a matter of opinion I suppose, but I wouldn't call it circular. For the closest to circular, you'd want a planet with close to 0 or close to 180 axial tilt (Mercury, Venus, Jupiter), and I don't particularly like the Mercury example cause the Sun stops in the sky once a year. I suppose you could call that a circular movement with a pit-stop in the great race-track of the sky. There used to be a great simulated video of what the sun passing over Mercury would look like but I can't find it now. 

Perihelion 0.85% of the semi-major axis, Aphelion 1.15%. At perihelion the solar intensity would be (1/.85)^2 = 38% stronger than normal. That might cause scorching heat in some places where the Perihelion lined up with summer, and you might get some bitter cold weather when the Aphelion lines up with winter (note, this doesn't always happen, perihelion slowly cycles around the calendar every 26,000 years or so). But when it lines up you might see some seasonal-weather extreemes, but Earth could (I think) survive even a 0.15 eccentricity. The views of Venus at Perihelion would be impressive too, Venus would stay in the sky longer and be larger and brighter. Push Earth's eccentricity to about .26 and Earth and Venus would get uncomfortabaly/scary close and might crash into each other. Fun to think about, but a potential planet killer. But apart from creating potentially greater variation in seasons, some very wild weather and perhaps triggering an ice age (perhaps the biggest ice age since snow-ball Earth) or accelerating climate change (it all depends on how the 3 Milankovich cycles line up with each other), You could push Earth's orbit surprisingly close to the Sun, half way to Venus or even closer at perihelion, without ending life on the planet. Now, if you adjust Earth's semi-major axis, which makes the orbit faster or slower, and changes the length of the year - with that, there's much less variation. @JThistle covered this. If you push Earth's semi-major axis just a few percentage points closer to the sun, Earth would heat up and it would get bad quickly. In fact, I think his estimates are conservative. There are already some pretty good estimates out there on this, just google "what will the Earth be like in 500 million years or a billion years" for a few articles. Here's one. The sun is growing slowly larger and more luminous, about 1% every 100 million years. That will be a significant problem as soon as 500-600 million years from now, perhaps less. Likewise, just a 2.5%-3% push closer to the sun would have a similar effect. You can't reduce Earth's semi-major axis by much without causing serious problems. Just 1% might be enough to melt Greenland over time, raise sea levels and prevent future ice ages. Similarly if you push Earth just 1-2% further away, Earth could enter permanent ice ages (fortunately we can fix that by burning oil and coal), but sans man made greenhouse gas, just 1%-2% further away would trigger perhaps a permanent ice age for the next several million years and perhaps, dangerously low CO2 levels, at least until Antarctica drifts north enough for it's ice to melt. It would be nice to be told to burn oil for the "good of the planet" though. :-) This is all very ballpark, but the Earth is, surprisingly, at a very good distance from the sun and just a few % one way or the other could be very bad, though in 15-25 million years when Antarctica is brushing up against South America and is no longer covered in ice, when that happens, Earth will have greater wiggle room away from the sun, but not closer to the sun. Precise mathematical answers to this question are obviously impossible. I'm just giving approximations. 

(Edit, I think my original conclusion here was wrong, having read up about it). While it seems probable that Pluto and Charon were formed by collision, I gather it's unlikely that this collision was so recent as to explain their lack of craters and young surface. The Collision, by most articles I've read, happened when the solar system was young, not in the last 100 million years. Now, it's possible that none of this is certain, but I retract that part of my original post. But, the creation of Charon by giant collision remains likely See here, and here. That would suggest formation within our solar-system, not from outside. Pluto/Charon are also among a fairly common orbital region called Trans-Neptunian objects. According to Wikipedia they suggest the collision that formed Charon happened 4.5 billion years ago. Sedna (love the story, by the way), has a very elongated and distant orbit which seems more likely with capture of an object. I agree with everything James Kilfinger said. Rogue planet/Rogue object capture may happen from time to time, but the Rogue would need to get quite close to the sun for the sun to have sufficient gravitation to achieve the capture. Highly elongated orbits would seem likely for solar-system orbital capture. Pluto is only slightly elongated and not a good candidate. More massive suns should have significantly greater capture numbers, but that's kinda obvious I suppose. 

That's true. That was the original Hubble discovery - the farther away things were, the faster they were moving away from us. 

There's no back and forth motion on the way towards tidal locking. There's kind of two ways to look this kind of "settling", there's overshooting and correction, basically a back and forth, and there's a very gradual force that grows smaller, basically moving towards zero but not overshooting. I realize that's just re-writing your question, but it helps to understand the 2nd option. I'll use the Earth as an example, because the Earth is in the gradual process of becoming tidally locked to the Moon. It's the same process, but easier to visualize. Because the Earth rotates faster than the Moon orbits, the tidal bulge moves ahead of the moon. This is called the tidal bulge offset. 

If someone here wants to explain this in more physical terms in their own words, please feel free. I'm a little bit over my head, but the article above explains some of the misleading aspects of the rubber sheet analogy. 

I did a little digging and I found this article. It's worth noting that the initial publication wasn't about resonances but the fact that all 6 objects came from the same side of the sky, from somewhat similar directions, which, given that they were the 6 most distant at the time, is statistically unusual and it was both similar direction and similar inclination to the plane, so the statistical improbability was high enough to investigate. Orbital resonance wasn't the primary argument, it was tacked on later as a secondary. From the article: 

Source Also, small point, but the 55km estimate assumes uniform temperature. The simpler pressure calculations don't take into account temperature fluctuation. With warmer temps and warmer lighter air at the bottom of the dig, which would be inevitable, you'd probably need 60 km, maybe 65 km of depth to achieve 1 atm. There's also circulation issues when you have cold heavier atmosphere above warm lighter atmosphere and there's drainage/flooding problems for the lowest part of a valley, so to avoid flooding, you might want to keep the surface temperature below freezing, to avoid runoff and silt build-up, or dig even deeper so there's a lake of sorts that catches the melting ground-ice around the dig and the living area is above the lake. This doesn't mean that deep valley living on mars will never be possible, but it's likely impossible with it's current atmosphere. With extensive terraforming, tapping gases from underground and/or from it's ice-caps or by crashing comets into Mars (that would take a lot of comets), over time, enough of an atmosphere could be created where deep valley living might work. A simulated atmospheric pressure can also be created with a bubble-dome of sorts, or one of my favorites, a stretch-wrap around the entire planet, but for now that's way beyond our means. For the near term, living underground on Mars is probably the way to go. Dig 50 or 100 feet underground and you'd have the means to create a near vacuum seal, which on Mars, you'd want to do, you could create earth like air pressure and you'd be protected from solar and cosmic rays and access to plenty of underground water. underground on Mars is likely the way to go, at least, in the near future. There's no shortages of articles on this. Here's one 6. Humans can also live at less than 1 atm. People have settled as high as 16,700 feet, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 55% of 1 atm. 

Neat and tidy calculations for this aren't possible. The math behind effective temperature of a planet can be found here and that's a straight forward calculation where you can input distance, solar energy, planet's albedo and get an average temperature. Earth's effective temperature calculation comes to -21 °C, which obviously isn't accurate, but that's as far as the calculation can take you. Feedback mechanisms: With essentially no change to distance from the sun, and only relatively small changes in tilt and eccentricity, Earth's temperature can fluctuate from a current 15 °C global average to about 5 °C as it goes in and out of ice ages. Feedback mechanisms like albedo (ice cover is the key driver, but also deserts, surface area of the oceans), CO2 capture, which increases with colder oceans, can amplify small changes, leading to significant changes in surface temperature. An orbital change, which should account for maybe 1 degree C, or an increase in CO2, which, by itself, captures less than 1 degree C, through feedback mechanisms, can lead to much larger temperature changes. More on feedback mechamisms here. Land placement and Ocean circulation 5 or 10 million years ago, Earth's average temperature was about 18-20 °C and that change was driven, primarily, by the closing of the Isthmus of Panama which affected ocean circulation. Just the closing of the Isthmus made ice ages possible. That's a pretty small change in the grand scheme of things, whether your planet has a near equatorial passage where oceans can flow or whether it doesn't, but that one thing can mean more than 10 degrees. As Antarctica drifted over the south pole (the last 30-35 million years or so) glaciers formed and the earth cooled, because as ice forms, more sunlight is reflected into space and oceans levels drop. Oceans having the lowest albedo and ice the highest. Also, as Antarctica driffs away from the south pole over the next 20-30 million years, Earth is expected to warm, unless another change occurs, like the continued absorption into land and the oceans of CO2. Earth can only enter an ice age when there's land near the poles. The glacial period of 440-460 million years ago most of the land was over the south pole. The sun was about 4% less luminous and the earth had much more CO2 (though CO2 levels did drop during that time, they didn't drop close to where they are now) and the orbit of the earth, 440 million years ago has some unknowns, but a large land mass over the south pole is thought to have played a key role in making that glaciation possible. The tipping point of ice formation at the poles is particularly sensitive and a significant variable. So, even with very similar to earth like planets. Just where the land is and how well the oceans circulate and whether the planet can form glaciers and sea ice, or not, can fluctuate perhaps 20 degrees C in global average temperature. How much CO2, how much active volcanism, how much reflective material in the upper atmosphere - all variables. Even with identical earths, the feedback mechanisms make it difficult to predict what Earth's temperature would be if you pushed Earth 1 million or 1/2 million miles further from the sun. The calculations for surface temperature wouldn't follow a simple mathematical formula. Now, you'd still get colder as you moved the planet away, but one push might give you 1-2 degree and the next push might give you 5-10 and the one after that 0-1. There would be no way to do a clean formula. 

While it's a clever suggestion, the answer is almost certainly that they are not related because the Nastapoka Arc "crater" is too big. It's 450 km in diameter. By comparison, the Chicxulub crater is 180 km. Even if an impact through mile of ice could, somehow, spread the impact out wider, the proposed Younger Dryas Impact object was almost certainly too small to leave a 340 km crater. There's also the problem that glacial ice carves the landscape and a neat circular crater is unlikely, even if the size had been a closer fit, an impact crater that was run over by a glacier should look disturbed by the glacier, not a neat circle visible on the surface. What geological evidence might remain for a large impact on a glacier is an interesting question given that the ice would significantly buffer any impact and continue to reshape the landscape below it as the glacier moves and/or melts and possibly floods the region. Mile high ice glaciers are relatively rare events, both localized and periodic, and large meteor impacts are also rare events. A combination of the two, large enough to leave clear evidence through the ice, would at best, be a hugely rare event and there's a good possibility that the right combination of impact and ice hasn't happened at all over the last 2.5 million years (northern Hemisphere) or on Antarctica (3% of the surface area of the earth) - last 20-30 million years. I think the safer bet is that there's no impact crater from the proposed Younger Dryas impact specifically because of the thickness of the glacier. It remains a debated hypothesis, so there's some uncertainty, but Ice should significanly buffer all but the largest impacts. For Younger Dryas, there should be other physical evidence such as debris from the impacting meteor or comet, but debris cast over a glacier that first re-freezes over and later melts can be spread very far and be very hard to identify. Much of it could have washed into the ocean. A somewhat related example, it took 105 years before debris from the Tunguska event was identified. (and this question should probably be moved to Earth Science). 

The Moon's apogee and perigee happen every 27.3 days (Sidereal orbit) and it's eccentricity changes measurably every orbit. In a sense, it's not very accurate to say the Moon even orbits around the Earth in an ellipse, it's too squashed and stretched for the elliptical model to be accurate. While the Earth takes about 100,000 orbits to go through one elliptical period, the Moon needs only 6 or 7 orbits to do that. Note how measurably it's perigee and apogee change every orbit. See table. There's a fair bit of information available on the Moon's irregular orbit, but I suspect that has almost nothing to do with your primary question. In general, in the 3 body system, as the Moon moves away from the Earth it's orbit grows more erratic, so in a sense, because of the sun, the Moon's orbit grows more eccentric, over time, where, if the sun wasn't there, it would grow more circular. 

So, 1 of 2 things can happen in the early formation of the Solar-system. One, the planets form and collect available ices and gas they can before the sun starts melting/pushing away any ice and gas inside the frost line, or 2, the sun forms first and the inner planets have very little gas and water as they form. They do get bombarded by hydrogen ejected from the sun, but mostly the inner planets aren't good at holding onto this hydrogen. In the 2nd scenario, any atmosphere and water they get would have to come from comet impacts. The early atmosphere of the inner planets were mostly CO2, CH4, NH3 maybe some N2. If Venus was struck by a couple extra comets, that alone would explain it and it's not statistically unreasonable. Now, I'm not saying this is what happened, only that it's possible. Venus retains most of it's CO2, but it could lose over time most of it's H20, CH3, NH3, maybe N2 if it was present, leading to the mostly CO2 atmosphere it has today. It's also theoretically possible that the giant impact that formed the moon also blew away a lot of Earth's early atmosphere. (not certain of that but the enormous addition of heat and rotation, it's possible). In the chart above, it suggests Venus won't lose much H20, but other charts have Venus closer to the H20 line. (google gas escape velocity planets for more charts) 

as you push 2 black holes closer together, there's never a point where the holes cancel each other out and create a zero gravity between them, but there is a ledge of sorts between them, below the near zero gravity of empty space. As the holes approach, they make each other bigger. The balancing point between them, is still inside the gravity well and as they get closer, the sweet spot between gets deeper and deeper in the 2-d representation.
