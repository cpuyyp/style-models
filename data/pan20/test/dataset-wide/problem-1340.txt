On my work I've got to maintain an Excel-sheet. Documenting the incident-tickets I've dealt with. For to be able to distinguish between single days easily I mark every second day with a light cyan-background. So the sheet gets a Zebra-stripe look. Because I've got to do this every second day (by marking the concerning row-range with the mouse) I've made myself a VBA procedure. It is started from the Excel-GUI. An input box appears in which I enter the start- and the end-row. Separated by a colon. The VBA then marks the range between start inclusive and end inclusive. Moreover it adds a bottom-border to the last row. Here the VBA-code: 

That's surely not great programming. But I use it already for a few months and it works for me. But how could it be improved so that it becomes more general? So that it could be given to colleagues which use Excel-sheets. This sheets are similar to mine but not exactly the same. Everyone has made his/her own. Any other comments, hints and tipps concerning coding style, structure, error handling etc. appreciated too. 

This is a really simple approach but it can be used to signal what happaned in the authentication process. Exit? What is the reason of the exists of an exit statement in a business layer class? Why is stopped the whole request process if the passwords not match? What happens if you want to test the password equality check method? If they are not equal the test stops? Direct $_SESSION write (super global) Of course writing into the $_SESSION array is not bad you can have your own session data handler in the background so everything can be done this way. But again: what happens if you want to test the functionality of writing a session data in your Auth class? You will test the session data saver also (your own or the one built into PHP)? I would wrap it into a class and pass an argument to the Auth class as i described above the IUserStore solution. HTTP stuff in an Auth class? Why is a header() call in your Auth class? Is it really neccessary or the redirection can be done depending on the result of the authentication process in your controller if you are following an MVC approach? 

I've made this animation using JavaScript and Sass CSS. Relevant is the code inside the IIFE. Because that's what I like to keep and develop further. Perhaps use it for future projects. Everything else is just quick & dirty made demo and less important. My code with uncompiled Sass CSS: 

For an FASM assembly course I've to do the following exercise: "Write a program that takes the number n as input. Then it prints all the numbers x below n that have exactly 2 different integral divisors (Besides 1 and x). For example: 15 is such a number. It is divisible by 1,3,5,15. (Here 3 and 5 are the two different divisiors, besides 1 and 15). However, 4 is not such a number. It is divisible by 1,2,4." Full description can be seen here: GitHub xorpd. Here's the code I've written: 

It works fine. But I would like to know: What do you think? Could it be improved concerning stability and efficiency? What do think about asking the range from the user via input box? Could one accomplish the same task in an easier perhaps more robust way? General hints and comments concerning my coding welcomed too. 

Helpful thing can be to create a static method to get all type, and another one to parse the type from a value. Whith these things a $participant->getRight() could return an instance of Mask so the switch can be removed. 

You can derive from the model class without any problem your attributes will get applied in you view model also (not every but for exmple the validation attributes will). I also recmommend to have copy constructors becouse they can help you a lot. Beside this my opinion is that no need to worry about display/display format attributes in you model classes it doesn't feel an incorrect way and it helps to keep things clear if you have a lot of derived classes. 

Stored procedure The query above is enough big to move it from the application layer to the database in the form of a stored procedure. It will be clearer and faster, the only disadvantage is that an SP has a hard dependency on the database type (MySQL, MSSQL, other). Return value(s) You are returning 3 types in your method: null, integer and boolean. Keep your logic clean, and return always one type if you can (yes, PHP has it's type juggling "issue" but still, clean code talks). 

I had to do this exercise for a further education in which I'm currently enrolled in: Write a Java class "Air Plane". Object-property names and types are given and compulsory. Write the according constructor and getter-, setter-method. Check within the constructor the given values for being valid. Moreover are the following methods to implement: 

Task description: A set of product-thumbnails is shown. The user can filter the shown products by vendor(s). Done by clicking one or multiple buttons. I used jQuery together with the Isotope-plugin: $URL$ First I had the idea of using iteration for assembling the filter-criterium string: 

Looking forward to read your comments concerning the two questions. Any other hints I would appreciate too. 

I've got to made a function which returns the checksum of an given integer. Source code of my implementation so far: 

This week I've had an idea for an Ajax loader animation: An air bubble ascending in a glass tube. Something like shown here: $URL$ I've used CSS-keyframes and -filters for to implement my idea. Finally I made a little demo for simulating the loading of data via Ajax-request. Compiled and minified code as an Live-Demo: 

This will result in one SQL query if the backend is an SQL database and will not recieve entites which are unnecessary (i think the Last() would download all entities). 

The second one seams to me a better approach but you say that the ManID is a primary key, so why are you handling it as a non primary key and using the query result as a sequance? 

The construcotr may not contain any business logic/work process Your logic is not enough clear to me (hard coded WHERE clause first [id=2] then in getNumVisits() is just a simple select all query, etc.) No they should not be used in classes, force to inject them into the worker methods (ISession interface) Clarify your logic please Just read the common OO and SOLID principles, search for Martin Flowler's name 

This is from my library it's similar to the other solutions but it's using a little hack: the array_key_exists() is a slow function so i execute first an isset() 'function' and if it's says "yes, it exists" then i don't have to execute the array_key_exists() function. The reason why isset() is not enough is the isset() will return FALSE if the key exists but the value is NULL. 

It seem to work alright. But frankly: With all the parameter-checking and taking different possibilities into account it has become a lot of code. If someone knows a possibility to write it more elegant then I would appreciate his or her answer. Any other hints welcomed too. Should mention: I can't use ES 6-syntax because we got only Internet Explorer 11 here and there won't be change in any nearer future. 

It's from a Java-course I'm enrolled into. The classes "Instructor" and "Book" are already provided. You got to write the different constructors of "Instructor" as well as the methods "getMostRecentBookTitle" and overloaded "updateBook". Here's are the final classes expanded with my additional code: 

The purpose of the function is to attach CSS-animations to HTML-elements with a text-content property. Like for example h1, div, p etc. It's not fully elaborated. Nevertheless have I decided to put it here for review. So: Any hints and recommendations welcome. 

An implementation of an image-slider I figured out. Could it be further improved? Or should I do it in a completely different way? Not sure if the technique of assigning a function to addEventListener by using bind works as expected. Are there possible flaws with the technique? Should I replace it with the old technique of calling a function (which needs parameter) within a anonymous function? 

I'm mostly with Heslacher's solution but in don't let to any of the collections to be null and i'm preparing to have null values in the collections. To spare some time i don't bother to create arrays from the input sources too. I also renamed the extensions method to EquivalentWith because SetEqual means a different thing. Tests I have used the provided unit test as base to write my ones so here are they: 

This is a cleaner version of your code with less query (the first was unneccesary) and inside the loop you are making a lot of small query which can be really bad but first you have to modify your code to not work directly with the context in you page code but through an interface (first iterate through the rows and get all data then pass them to the worker (which can work with the context) and return the result & update the UI). 

If this query performance slow then check the indexing on your server (EXPLAIN). The important thing is that with SQL server we have to work with small number of huge result sets instead of a lot of small subqueries. 

How to structure / shorten the JavaScript- and Sass-code better? How could the animation be improved? So that it runs smoother and more "natural"? How to improve the responsiveness? 

I've made this function for to get a deep copy (recursive copy) of objects. => Sub-objects aren't references to the sub-objects of the original object. Instead they are objects on their own. Here's my code ... Attention: Most of it are test data and an additional test-function. 

Task description: Search the highest ID within a given JSON-structure: An array with objects as elements. Every object has a property "ID". Then increment the highest ID and return it as a result. For to become the next ID used. There can be gaps within the given data-structure (because of prior delete operations). This gaps aren't allowed to use. It shall always be: Highest ID plus 1. I have currently two different implementations for a solution. The first solution is a more functional approach: 

The code has passed the automated tests. But I would appreciate some real feedback. What do you think about my string-processing and the way I've done the type conversion? What would you have done different and why? All comments, hints and answers appreciated. 

Then you have to clear your SQL statements becouse you are running to much query against the database while you can fatch all data with only 2 query. SQL First the companions: 

Multiple problems Why is static? Why is the database hardcoded in the class? Echo or return? Neither Exit? Direct $_SESSION write (super global) HTTP stuff in an Auth class? Why is static? You are using stuffs in static where you should not have. Handling database through a static proxy? Untestable, unreadable and what happens if some forget initialize it? Same thing applies to your class which is handling the authentacation. Why is it static? If you wan't to access it whereever you want then create a static facade class and keep the main logic in a separated non-static class. Why is the database hardcoded in the class? What happens if you don't want to use anymore a standard SQL database to store your users? You will rewrite the whole class to achive that? If you create a new class as i described above leave out this hardcoding use constructor injection instead:
