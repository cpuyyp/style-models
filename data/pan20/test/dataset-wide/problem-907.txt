If I read Dylan correctly, he, a contrarian if ever there was one, is actually arguing that his songs are not "literature" as the term is commonly understood. Of course, this also implies his award is a mistake. Not many people would deliver a Nobel Prize lecture suggesting that their award was an error, but again, this is Bob Dylan we're talking about. Once we let go of the assumption that he clearly must be defending his suitability for the award, the piece reads much more naturally as a defense against his songs being primarily considered as literature (rather than as living works that must be performed to truly be appreciated). 

It seems likely that Adams was just taking an opportunity to get one more adolescent dig in at an old friend and rival, who thus got to be immortalized as the "worst poet in the universe." Sources claim that Adams was a regular contributor to Johnstone's high school English zine, and that the two of them jointly received a prize in English while attending the Brentwood School in Essex. The poem attributed to him in the book as an example of his wretchedness was actually written by him (I'm guessing as another high school joke). An old schoolmate of both of them remembers Johnstone as "unbearably pompous for a 19-year old" but Adams as only slightly less so. His name was disguised in the print editions of The Hitchhiker's Guide as "Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings," after he complained, apparently not because of being called the "worst poet" but because his complete actual home address was included in the original broadcast (which seems like a reasonable concern). So in other words, Adams was both trolling Johnstone and doxing him, doubtlessly for his own personal amusement. Would any one among us do less for an old high-school friend? 

If "To Autumn" were merely a pretty description of the season, it wouldn't be considered a great poem. In fact, to read it as a straightforward celebration is to fall into the same trap as the bees in the first stanza: 

The lines you've quoted are from the 1842 version of the poem, which uses stay intransitively and obscures the sense a bit. The corresponding lines in the 1833 version use the verb transitively, and make the sense clearer: 

Both Barabas and Shylock further the stereotype of the conniving, greedy Jew, but in Marlowe's play, the Christians are not much better; and in Shakespeare, Shylock too is a victim of Antonio's antisemitism. When asked why he is so eager to enforce the contract against Antonio, Shylock says: 

In the time when this was written (ancient Greece). Whether Homer's epics can rightly be considered written is a whole 'nother question. Short answer, no. In the time when this was written (ancient Greece). Most of what we know about ancient Greece, including the stuff about marriage and sex that's in this answer, is from the classical period: 5th C BCE. The earliest Homeric mss are from the 2nd C BCE. Three hundred years is a long time. Think how much our own social structures and sexual mores have changed since the early 1700s, and use your judgment. Translations are by Stanley Lombardo, from Book 5, pages 73 and 76. 

I had always read this as Bastian somehow bringing the Water across the barrier between the two worlds, and thus as the one solid counter to the idea that it all takes place in Bastian's head. However, as pointed out in the comments, Bastian is unaware that his entire journey took place overnight, and thus that his garments are indeed still wet from his previous night's rains. With that said, given that this is a work of reconstructivist art, I don't think the dual interpretations are either unintentional or incompatible. Ende is telling us that this is simultaneously both Real AND in all in Bastian's head, those are not different things within the larger framework Ende is creating. 

During Bastian's return from Fantastica, the following sequence of events takes place (starting on page 388 in my Dutton 1997 edition): 

By "Plato's whimsies" he almost certainly means the idea of the Ideal Forms, or more in general, the metaphysical idea of their being another layer of "Reality" deeper and more real than our own, and from which our own is a forever imperfect copy. These ideas were made explicitly religious by the Neoplatonists, and then incorporated into Christian theology via the work of St Augustine and other early Christian theologians --this work being the "artificial Christianity" Jefferson is also deriding. Jefferson describes Plato's Ideals as foggy and misty. This is because of Plato's claim that we can only grasp them in part here (in the ordinary world), and that any version of them we envision is necessarily incomplete and inaccurate. Jefferson's language probably deliberately echoes St. Paul's famous metaphor of "seeing in a mirror, darkly" as the natural condition of moral, earthly life. Also note that his description of Plato as a "genuine sophist," is a backhanded compliment at best, since Plato consistently portrayed the sophists (who were pre-Socratic philosophers) as superficial wisdom peddlers constantly being bested by Socrates. (This would be like calling Jesus a "genuine Pharisee.") Jefferson is further suggesting that it is only because of (what he would probably view as) the historical accident of a syncretic synthesis of Christian and Platonic ideas that Plato's reputation and philosophies survive at all, despite what he sees as their blatant silliness. His last statement implies that most modern thinkers wouldn't give such obsolete ideas even the ghost of a thought, but that it is enjoyable to talk them over, even dismissively, with someone else educated in the ancient Classics and Christian theology. (It is, however, worth noting that we still study Plato, even two more centuries past the time of Jefferson. Furthermore his "whimsies" were already 300 years old at the time of Christ --and twice that by the time Augustine learned them.) 

As a native English speaker I find the word arbalest archaic, at best. Crossbow, or huge battle crossbow, conveys to me the original meaning of the phrase огромный боевой арбалет clearly and succinctly. Admittedly, I have not read Трудно быть богом, in English or Russian. However, the only possible excuse I could think of to use arbalest would be to convey an image of some extremely old-fashioned (but still deadly, of course) weapon. Perhaps this is the case. 

First, congratulations on having read so far in Brothers Karamazov. It takes determination, at the very least, to suffer through the excruciating detail that is characteristic of Dostoevsky’s style. Dostoevsky gives us many character portraits of people in Russia at that time, many of them negative. So, in general, the scene with Lygavy portrays another type of typical personage, the drunken and malicious Russian peasant. In the novel, the suffocation scene of Lyagavy is a piece of the puzzle, a stroke of the brush in painting, for the illustration of hopelessness, and absurdity, of Dimitry’s situation in this part of the novel. It is indicative of not only the hopeless affair with Grushenka, but of the sea of aggressive, but petty buffoonery in which he is practically drowning. When he is shown holding a wet cloth to some drunken peasant, it just shows how low he has sunken. To answer your question: This whole scene may actually focus Dimitry’s mind on his entire situation, by sinking him so low, so close to suffocation himself, as to begin to ask himself serious questions. However, he has yet, in the novel, to focus on higher minded objectives. NOTE: To me it is interesting to see the meaning of some Russian names, i.e. Lyagavy can mean, in Russian, one who has lied. In this scene, Lyagavy also called Mitya a liar, thus adding another small layer to the portrayal of absurdity. Dostoevsky is indeed a master of this form. 

Similarly, the second half of Sodom and Gomorrah (volume 4), and the entirety of The Prisoner and The Fugitive (volumes 5 and 6), constitute what is called "the Albertine cycle". Aaron Matz says of this cycle: 

(p. 89) Genung argues that the first cycle focuses on the past: on memories of good times with Hallam that can never be relived. The second cycle focuses on the present: on the community of friends and on enjoyments that Hallam would have been a part of had he been alive. The final cycle focuses on the future: on the renewal of that community and its evolution into a higher force. A reading of the three Christmas celebrations does demonstrate an overall trajectory from sorrow to resignation. In the first one, Section XXVIII, Tennyson describes his despair on hearing Christmas bells: 

No doubt there are others. "Three blind mice" fits with this general partiality toward nursery rhymes, and when that title was hors de combat, "The Mousetrap" was a good substitute. 

This is a classic example of what Gayle Rubin, in her celebrated 1975 essay of the same title, called "the traffic in women": a man gives his daughter or sister as a gift to another man, so as to augment the status of both men as well as maintain the social economy. The woman in this scenario is property. Before her marriage, she belongs to her father or brother; after, to her husband. Sexual fidelity was de rigeur for Greek women because adultery allowed another man access to the husband's property; and this raises the further, more threatening possibility that the children who inherit that property may not be his own. This would destroy the social economy entirely. This role of women would explain why, as Coontz mentions, marriage based on love would be considered "a serious threat to social order". Marriage was the means by which social bonds were consolidated, status maintained, property acquired, and its orderly transfer ensured. Erotic love cares about none of those things, being based on individual desire rather than social needs. So it had no place in marriage. Erotic life among the Greeks If marriage was not for the fulfillment of sexual desire, then it is understandable that, as we saw earlier, men formed erotic relationships "elsewhere". Where was that? Rauh lists three outlets for men's sexual energies (quote has been edited for length): 

There is no perfect translation. In any translation there is always a balance between semantic precision and preservation of poetic devices, language usage, etc. You first have to decide on what kind of translation to do: Literary or Literal. A literary translation translates the original into a plausibly literate presentation of the original, maintaining at least some if not all of the literary devices used in the original. This is the more difficult. It really almost requires the creation of a new work of literature, based upon, and hopefully equal in quality to, the original. Various French poetic translations of Eugene Onegin come to mind. Literal translations normally seek only to translate semantic meaning, devoid of most elements of style, elocution or the word symbolism of the original language. Both kinds of translations have to deal with word flow, sense of humor, cultural references, and descriptions understood by native speakers when reading the original language that are often difficult or impossible to accurately render in the target language. Having said all this, I believe that the real challenge in translating a work of literature is to have such extensive knowledge of the target language to be able to decide, after all, what sounds good, and reasonable, and readable, and literate. NOTE: Dramatic works are somewhat different…one has to understand the specific production nuances of theatrical works, stage directions, etc., and to understand the dynamics of theater. The final translation of a play takes place on stage, after all. 

However, from both Shattuck's and Matz's articles, it is clear that these relatively self-contained narratives don't map cleanly to individual volumes. In talking about the "first two sections of Proust's novel", Shattuck means the first two parts of volume 1, Swann's Way, which are thereby the first two sections of the novel as a whole; he does not mean (as one might assume) the first two volumes of the seven that constitute the entire work. And Matz likewise refers to the Albertine cycle as comprising half of one volume, and the two next volumes. So a given volume of Proust's work does not itself constitute a self-contained whole. Characters recur from one volume to the next, and for the most part, knowledge of what went on in a previous volume is assumed in subsequent volumes. Since Proust did not complete the final revisions on the last three volumes, some overlaps, repetitions, and inconsistencies occur, so the narrative isn't developed entirely in a clean arc. Proust's technique, too, isn't strictly linear. However, this makes reading the novel in order more important, not less; reading the volumes out of order will make the experience difficult and confusing (some might say "more difficult and confusing"), as you won't be able to tell whether some gap or inconsistency is due to the technique, the inadequate revision, or your having skipped a volume. 

Searching for a work of metafiction I read about 5 years ago, probably published originally in the early 2000s. It's a bizarre fable about a young man who develops an obsession with a girl, a stranger to him, who is in a coma. I seem to think there may have been a motorcycle involved. He tells her a series of increasingly lurid and dreamlike fairy tales about him and her, where each story is nested inside the last, like the Arabian Nights. If I recall correctly, the characters are named only with letters, and even the "base level" of reality has a strongly allegorical feel, implying that each of alternate fantasy versions of the story is as valid as the original. It seems like Kafka and/or Nabakov may have been an influence. I believe the narrator has a mundane job of some sort, like accountant, and is apprenticed to his uncle. I didn't find it entirely successful as a book --partly because it never felt grounded in any stable reality --but it was memorable, at least in its conceit, if not by title and author. 

Unlike, say, Dolly's stutter (an unfortunate affliction) or Stuffy's greediness (the result of parental overindulgence), the flaws that Jack and Ned have are seen as something wrong with their character, as moral failings. Nothing in the course of Little Men changes that assessment or causes us to feel sympathy for them. For example, Jack steals Tommy's money, and is perfectly happy to let Nat bear the burden of suspicion; when Ned grudgingly begins to accept that Nat might not be the thief after all, he bullies Nat to try and get at the truth. Alcott does show that each boy has his virtues as well. Jack does eventually confess to the theft and try to atone; Ned does treat Nan with disinterested affection. But for all that, neither Jack nor Ned form any significant connections with their fellow students at Plumfield. Every other boy or girl has at least one close attachment: Dan with Nat, Demi with Daisy, Tommy with Nan, Dick with Dolly, and so on. Through such attachments, the students become part of the larger Plumfield community and show the success of the school's methods. Jack and Ned evidently haven't formed any such bonds with the community. Their careers after Plumfield show that their inherent nature is the same. Jack is still "money-loving"; he is a businessman "bent on getting rich". And Ned is a lawyer; nuff said. Joking apart, the reason they are "failures" is precisely that "no one mourned their absence". Unlike the other boys (and random girl or two) of Plumfield, Jack and Ned have not made themselves part of the place. So when Nat is on the verge of departure for the untamed wilds of Europe (let us remember what a barbarian place it was in the 19th century, especially when seen from the vantage point of the high culture and civilization then prevalent in America), the rest of the community gathers to wish him farewell; Jack and Ned are not connected enough to feel drawn to participate, and worse, nobody cares that they aren't part of the gathering. Is there a greater indication of failure in life than that your presence or absence makes no difference to anybody?
