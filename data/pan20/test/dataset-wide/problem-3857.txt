There is another very nice theorem: if $K \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ has complex codimension $ \geq 2$ (real codimension $\geq 4$), and $f$ is an analytic function on $\mathbb{C}^n \setminus K$, then $f$ extends to $K$ -- no need for a boundedness hypothesis! I though this was called Hartog's theorem, but Wikipedia disagrees. 

Summarizing what Cole says for my own understanding: By methods which he doesn't make clear to me, Cole found solutions to $x^2 \equiv a \bmod N$ for many small values of $a$ and convinced himself (but not rigorously) that many other $a$ were not achievable. This gave many congruence conditions on possible divisors of $N$. In this manner, he was rapidly able to filter the integers up to $16$ million down to just a few trial divisors, none of which worked. (Note that it is okay if he winds up trying some non-prime divisors in the process.) At this point, he used his data in a different way. Suppose that $N=pq$ and look at one of his small values of $a$, for example $a=-7$. Since he knew $-7$ was square modulo $N$, we deduce that $p$ and $q$ are each $ 1$ , $2$ or $4 \bmod 7$ and, since $2^{67}-1 \equiv 1 \bmod 7$, we get that $(p,q)$ is $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$ or $(4,2) \bmod 7$. This means that $(p+q)/2 \equiv 1$ or $3 \bmod 7$. In this way, he obtained many modular conditions on $(p+q)/2$, giving a few possibilities. For each possibility $x$, he checked whether $x^2-N$ was square. When he tried the right option, he had $x^2-N = ((p+q)/2)^2 - N = ((p-q)/2)^2$ and won. 

If $f(z) = \prod (z-z_i)^{n_i}$, with $z_i$ distinct, then $GCD(f(z), f'(z)) = \prod (z-z_i)^{n_i-1}$, so the number of distinct complex roots is $\deg f - \deg GCD(f, f')$. If $f$ has rational coefficients, or in some other sense can be computed with exactly, this is a practical method; polynomial GCD can be computed by the Euclidean algorithm. If the coefficients of $f$ are only known approximately, then you need to think about what you mean by number of roots, since perturbing $x^2$ (one root) can give $x^2-\epsilon$ (two roots). Also, if you meant to ask how many real roots there are, see Sturm's theorem. 

You definition of "algebraic" is very strange when $R$ is not a domain. Due to that strangeness, it is easy to find examples: Let $k$ be a field, let $R = k \times k$ and let $S = k[t] \times k[t]$. Then $(t,0)$ obeys $(0,1) \cdot (t,0)=(0,0)$ and $(0,t)$ obeys $(1,0) \cdot (0,t) = (0,0)$. However, I claim that $(t,t)=(t,0) + (0,t)$ is not algebraic over $R$. If $$\sum (a_i, b_i) (t,t)^i=0$$ then $\sum a_i t^i=\sum b_i t^i=0$ in $k[t]$, so all $a_i$ and all $b_i$ are zero. A more reasonable definition would probably be to require that your element satisfy a polynomial which is not zero modulo any minimal prime of $R$. But perhaps the failure of the unreasonable definition is good enough for your purposes. 

Write $(t_1: t_2: \ldots: t_n)$ for the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. For $I$ a nonempty subset of $\{ 1,2, \ldots, n \}$, let $Z_I$ be the subset of $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ where $|t_i|=|t_{i'}|$ for $i$ and $i' \in I$ and $|t_i| > |t_j|$ for $i \in I$ and $j \not \in I$. Note that $Z_I \cong (S^1)^{|I|-1} \times D^{2(n-|I|)}$, where $D^k$ is the open $k$-disc. Also, $\overline{Z_I} = \bigcup_{J \supseteq I} Z_J \cong (S^1)^{|I|-1} \times \overline{D}^{2(n-|I|)}$ where $\overline{D}^k$ is the closed $k$-disc. We now cut those torii into discs. For $i$ and $i'$ in $I$, cut $Z_I$ along $t_i=t_{i'}$ and $t_i = - t_{i'}$. So the combinatorial data indexing a face of this subdivision is a cyclic arrangement of the symbols $i$ and $-i$, for $i \in I$, with $i$ and $-i$ antipodal to each other. For example, let $I=\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \}$ and write $t_k=e^{i \theta_k}$ for $k \in I$. Then one of our faces corresponds to the situation that, cyclically, $$\theta_1 < \theta_2 = \theta_4 + \pi < \theta_3 = \theta_5 < \theta_1+ \pi < \theta_2 + \pi = \theta_4 < \theta_3 + \pi = \theta_5 + \pi < \theta_1.$$ This cell is clearly homeomorphic to $\{ (\alpha, \beta) : 0 < \alpha < \beta < \pi \}$. Similarly, each of these cells is an open ball, and each of their closures is a closed ball. We have put a CW structure on the torus. Cross this subdivision of the torus with the open disc $D^{2(n-|I|)}$. The result, if I am not confused, is a regular $CW$ decomposition of $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. 

Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem: Let $f \in \mathbb{R}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ be a rational function which is positive everywhere on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then there exist rational functions $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_N$ such that $f=\sum g_i^2$. Proof sketch: Let $K$ be the field $\mathbb{R}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. If $f$ is not a sum of squares, then there is a total ordering of $K$ where $f$ is negative. Let $L$ be the real closure of $K$ with respect to that ordering. Then the rational function $f$, evaluated at the point $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in L^n$, is negative. But the theory of real closed fields is complete, so $f$ must be negative somewhere in $\mathbb{R}^n$, contrary to hypothesis. See Jacobson Basic Algebra II for a detailed exposition. 

The answer is $9$. Choose a curve $C$ with the required topology. Choose $8$ points $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_8$ on $C_1$. The conditions of passing through the $x_i$ impose $8$ linear conditions on the $10$ dimensional space of cubics, so we can find a second cubic $E$ passing through the $x_i$ and not proportional to $C$. Let $x_9$ be the ninth intersection of $C$ and $E$. I claim that $x_9$ is also on $C_1$. Proof: Consider $C_1$ as a loop in $\mathbb{RP}^2$, and let $\tilde{C}_1$ be the preimage in the universal cover $S^2$. The loop $C_1$ is not contractible so, if we travel all the way around $C_1$, we will go from $(x,y,z)$ to $(-x,-y,-z)$ in $S^2$. Since $E$ is an odd degree polynomial, $E(x,y,z) = - E(-x,-y,-z)$. So $E$ must change sign an odd number of times along $C_1$. We already know that it changes sign at $x_1$, ..., $x_8$; the only place to get an additional sign change is at $x_9$. (Note that this argument shows that $C_1 \cap D$ is always odd, counting with multiplicity. I think that a careful count will show that $C_1 \cap D_1$ is odd, and the other three possibilities are always even.) Now, $E$ may not have the right topology. But, for $\epsilon$ sufficiently small, the curve $D= C+\epsilon E$ also passes through $x_1$, ..., $x_9$, and it does have the right topology. 

This isn't exactly an answer to your question, but Lenstra and Stevenhagen's article Cebatarov and his Density Theorem does a very good job covering some of the problems that lead up to Class Field Theory, including Cebatarov's original proof of his theorem. 

$\def\Spec{\mathrm{Spec}\ }$Let me try to add an answer with a bit more big picture. I'm not an expert here, so I'm hoping Matt E., B. and K. Conrad and others will help improve this. I'll start by outlining the proof of geometric CFT which you'll find in Serre's Algebraic Groups and Class Fields. (There is another line of proof which you'll find in, for example, David Ben Zvi's MSRI talk, and I am still absorbing.) Theorem 1 Let $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension (with no further conditions on the fields) with $A = \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. Then there is an algebraic group $G$ over $K$, an embedding of $A \times \Spec(K)$ into $G$, and maps $\Spec(L) \to G$ and $\Spec K \to G/A$, such that the diagram $$\begin{matrix} \Spec L & \rightarrow & G \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ \Spec K & \rightarrow & G/A \end{matrix}$$ commutes, with $\Spec L$ the preimage of $\Spec K$ within $G$, and with the two actions of $A$ on $\Spec L$ (by multipication in $G$, and by the Galois action) being equal. This sounds very technical, but you probably have seen two special cases of it. Special Case 1 If $K$ contains the $m$-th roots of unity and $A = \mathbb{Z}/m$, then we can take $G$ to be the multipicative group and $A \subset G$ to be the $m$-th roots of unity; the theorem then says that $L$ is of the form $K(\alpha^{1/m})$ for some $\alpha \in K^{\ast}$. This is Kummer's thoerem. The maps $L \to G$ and $K \to G/A \cong G$ are given by $\alpha^{1/m}$ and $\alpha$. Special Case 2 If $K$ has characteristic $p$ and $A = \mathbb{Z}/p$, then we can take $G$ to be the additive group and $A \subset G$ to be the elements of $\mathbb{F}_p$. Then $G/A \cong G$, with the map $G \to G/A \cong G$ being $y \mapsto y^p-y$. So the theorem says that there is some $\beta \in K$ such that $L = K(y)/(y^p-y-\beta)$. This is the Artin-Schrier theorem. If you are familiar with the proofs of Kummer and Artin-Schrier, the proof of Theorem 1 isn't much harder. Theorem 2 Let $A$, in the above theorem, be abelian. Then we can take $G$ to be abelian as well. In this case, $G/A$ is itself an algebraic group, which we will call $J$. We now specialize to the case that $K$ and $L$ are the fields of meromorphic functions on curves $X$ and $Y$ over some ground field $k$. Write $f: Y \to X$ for the covering map. We do not yet assume that $k$ is finite. Theorem 3 We can take the group $G$ to be defined over $k$, with $A \subseteq G(k)$. This means that we can interpret the above diagram more geometrically: We can find an open subset $X^{\circ}$ of $X$ such that, setting $Y^{\circ}:= f^{-1}(X^{\circ})$, there is a commutative diagram $$\begin{matrix} Y^{\circ} & \rightarrow & G \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ X^{\circ} & \rightarrow & G/A \end{matrix}$$ as before. Now let $k= \mathbb{F}_q$ and let $F$ denote the $q$-power Frobenius. Theorem 4 When $A$ is abelian and $k = \mathbb{F}_q$, we can find a map $h: J \to G$ such that the composites $G \to J \to G$ and $J \to G \to J$ are $F-1$. Warning I suspect that I am missing a technical hypothesis, perhaps that $L$ and $\bar{k}$ be disjoint. Special Cases In an Artin-Schrier extension, $G \cong J$ is the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a$ and the map $G \to J$ is $y \mapsto y^p-y$. If $m | q-1$, then $\mathbb{F}_q$ contains the $m$-th roots of unity. In the Kummer extension, $G \cong J \cong \mathbb{G}_m$, with $G \to J$ being $x \mapsto x^m$ and $J \to G$ being $x \mapsto x^{(q-1)/m}$. So the composite is $x \mapsto x^{q} x^{-1}$. Generalizing the computation in my other answer shows: Theorem 5 With the above hypotheses, if $D$ is a divisor supported on $X^{\circ}$, and $\bar{D}$ the divisor which it splits into in $X^{\circ}(\bar{k})$, then $$h \left( \sum_{\pi \in \bar{D}} \pi \right) = \mathrm{Art}(D)$$. Here the sum $\sum_{\pi \in \bar{D}} \pi$ lives in $J(\bar{k})$, the map $h$ puts it into $G(\bar{k})$, and the assertion is it is equal to $\mathrm{Art}(D)$ under the embedding $A \to G(k)$. Examples In the Kummer case, Theorem 5 says that $\mathrm{Art}(D) = \prod_{\pi \in \bar{D}} \alpha(\pi)^{(q-1)/m}$. In the Artin-Schrier case, Theorem 6 says that $\mathrm{Art}(D) = \sum_{\pi \in \bar{D}} \beta(\pi)$. Now, for the result which uses the most technical tools. This is basically Theorem 3.2 in Brian Conrad's notes. By the way, this works for any perfect $k$, not just a finite field. Theorem 6 If $A$ is abelian, we can take $J$ to be a generalized Jacobian $J(\mathfrak{m}, X)$, for some conductor $\mathfrak{m}$, and $X \to J$ we can take a translation of the standard map $X \to J(\mathfrak{m}, X)^1$. Moreover, we can take the support of $\mathfrak{m}$ to be the set $S$ of critical points of $Y \to X$, and we can take $X^{\circ} = X \setminus S$. In particular, if $Y \to X$ is unrammified, we can take $J$ to be the Jacobian and $S = \emptyset$. Warning I might be slightly missing something in the last sentence; I would have expected to see conditions like "$Y$ is geometrically connected" and "$Y(k) \neq \emptyset$" showing up. Let me point out the subtlety of the last sentence of Theorem 6. Let $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2$, and let $A = \mathbb{Z}/2$. Then $L = K(\sqrt{\alpha})$ for some $\alpha$. In our high-tech language, we can take $G$ to be the multiplicative group $\mathbb{G}_m$, with $A$ embedded as $\{ \pm 1 \}$. $X^{\circ}$ is the locus where $\alpha$ is nonzero and the map $X \to G/A \cong G$ is given by the function $\alpha$ on $X^{\circ}$. Even if $Y \to X$ is an unbranched cover, the function $\alpha$ will still have zeroes and poles (of even order). We cannot map the entire projective curve $X$ to an affine group like $\mathbb{G}_m$. Theorem 6 is telling us that, by using a very different group, the Jacobian of $X$, we can arrange for the map to $J$ to be defined everywhere on $X$. Combining Theorems 5 and 6 and the definition of $J(\mathfrak{m}, X)$, we have Key Theorem Let $k$ be finite and $A$ abelian. Then there is a modulus $\mathfrak{m}$, supported on the ramified primes $S$ of $Y \to X$, such that $\mathrm{Art}$ is trivial on principal ideals whose generators are $1 \bmod \mathfrak{m}$.
