Daniel Chandler wrote a book Semiotics: the Basics and also supplies an online version here. For a large part of English speaking academia, after Chomsky's reformulation of linguistics into the field that it is today, semiotics became something of a minor topic. At the very least it is not studied in those circles the same way it was studied when Pierce and Saussure were doing their work. That being said, there is still some contemporary work on the subject in English, such as Chandler's introduction. Outside of English speaking academia, semiotics is still a lively field of study, especially in French speaking countries. However, I am a native English speaker with little background in French and I will be unable to help you find those sources. MIT's Open Courseware program has a lot of lectures on philosophy of language and linguistics. Some of the courses have full lecture notes, some of them have selected lecture notes and unfortunately some of them have no lecture notes. However, all of them list the syllabus for the class which includes the required readings, both papers and textbooks. You might be interested in Professor Yablo's 2011 course on philosophy of language as well as Professor Holton's 2005 class on the same subject, both of which have lecture notes. Two great textbooks on the subject are Philosophy Of Language by A.P. Martinich and David Sosa as well as Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction by William G Lycan. For linguistics, they also have classes on Introduction to linguistics, Syntax, as well as Semantics and Pragmatics. The textbooks and other suggested readings listed on the syllabus should point you in the right direction as well. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which is a great resource for introductions to philosophical topics, has an article on the philosophy of linguistics and it has an exstensive bibiliography containing more references and resources. The authors that you mentioned are all authors that wrote primary sources on these topics, the textbooks and lectures I've provided are contemporary authors providing commentary and introductions to the primary material. The purpose is to give you a better understanding of what the ideas being presented are so that you can later go and study the primary papers yourself with the tools you need to understand what is being discussed. In this respect, these lectures and textbooks are a lot less difficult to read than the primary sources. 

By multi-meaning-messages I mean the capability of the people to convey communication with different significance (sometimes even opposite) to different target audiences/constituencies AND such information co-habit. It could be considered lie but due to status of the emitter is not handled as such. The emitter of the message is aware of it and use it as a tool to expand/keep its influence for example. Most of the receivers are not aware of it. I had been noticing that philosophy plays an important role for effectiveness on absorption of the messages by different targets. Examples 1: [As Lewandowsky says about the billionaires supporting rightwing populism: “Theirs are very personal motives and probably not the motives these people will admit to themselves. There are very few people who say, ‘I’m greedy and I like being greedy.’ Instead they will say, ‘I’m a libertarian and I believe that society is best served if free individuals pursue their own interests.’”] $URL$ Example 2: When persons use the term "democracy" they might mean "democratism". Example 3: When persons use the terms "Nation:State" they might mean "Oligarchy:Corporation". The picture tries to capture that sometimes the multi-meaning-messages can run very deep and does not spread fast... 

It's difficult. Most philosophy courses teach the History of philosophy instead of just what the basic fundamentals are and what leading ideas are. Classes that follow people instead of ideas tend to be a waste of time. In a nutshell you have: 

I would say that we are much closer to having a rational chain of reasoning for laws based in Ethics today, but we are not there yet. 

Lies are a violation of most ethical systems. Usually statistics in books and the media are rarely fabricated (b), but very frequently they are out of context (a). This becomes very deadly when used as a premise to justify conclusions which would be an egregious premeditated lie with a false justification. Many authors and media commentators state a ton of facts to build a case and then jump to a conclusion without making any necessary links between the truck load of raw data that is taken out of context and the idea they are trying to promote. Plato talks about the Noble Lie. In essence his contention is that during a debate or similar circumstance you could perform a calculated lie in which your opponent in trying to dispute it would unravel the false basis of their position. I personally believe this was along the lines of agreeing with an opposing irrational view, and encourage taking the idea to the extreme. Manipulation The second ethical violation could be to purposely mislead people via Moving the Conversation to a red herring (reference). While not a direct lie, it can be seen as unethical to redirect the conversation purposely off track to avoid admission of the truth. Politicians frequently do this in debates, and a simple example could be as simple as citing a number of outlier events consuming the majority of the talk time, and claiming victory when not all of them are rebutted. This falls primary into the realm of intellectual dishonesty although many ethical systems may see this as unethical. Noble Lies An example of a Noble Lie could be(1): 

Philosophy is a tool. It is a good tool. If the tool is used properly it will benefit our daily lives. If we do not use it properly it will not benefit. Philosophy used properly: .. An illiterate and handicap mother in Africa which just lost her youngest child due to malaria... An western person who is familiar with philosophy OR not and finds a way to support organizations who are capable to reach those who are struggling. Philosophy is about DOING good! Philosophy not used properly: .. Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem quoting Immanuel Kant to justify his terrible works. The picture tries to illustrate how philosophy can help the person to navigate from a war contributor to a peace contributor... 

Maybe this help: [Definition: A necessary condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that must be satisfied in order for S to obtain.] [Definition: A sufficient condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that, if satisfied, guarantees that S obtains.] From here. It has got examples and a tests. ☺ 

The context for the second quote is that Leonard Susskind asked Aaronson to explain a word from his mathematical background that people with a physics background might not understand or use in the same way. The reason everyone laughed is because the other physicists and computer scientists in the room understood how tongue in cheek Aaronson's pick for the word was: physics doesn't deal with theorems, in a mathematical sense, it deals with conjectures. That's why Susskind sarcastically says "A theorem, what's that?" And of course the "box" comment is a reference to what's put at the end of a proof of a theorem. Ultimately, theorems are things that are deductively proven and as such exist in mathematics and logic. Theorems are used in science as well, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to help you solve a mechanics problem, but science doesn't prove theorems. Science tries to create theoretical models that help explain physical phenomena and those models can always be revised via new information. So if you are trying to apply the word theorem to a physical theory you are going to fail, the only parts of the physical theory that are theorems are the purely mathematical parts. 

Good question. SUV is a car but we call it SUV assuming that is a car. Enlightenment is a religion but we call it Enlightenment assuming that religion is detached from Enlightenment. It seems it is not possible for our little brains to split religion AND something such as science, capitalism, communism, clubism, statism, enlightenment and so for... things emerge from other things... As Max Planck put it "For religion, God is at the beginning; for science, God is at the end." See more, for example, in God Is a Person Reflections of Two Nobel Laureates. Religion is embedded everywhere. ☺ It seems to me The Analyst, by George Berkeley, 1734 was a superior exercise to make sense of things which worried him then. It was so good that even today we revisit it. Read, please, the text of the image the way it is presented and then read it replacing "I" by "Religion" ☺ 

This objection seems to hit on the question I posed above for future research. If the neural networks are unable to parse individual semantic atoms then we would not be able to reliably say they are using a language of thought. Again, this needs a lot more testing. In summation the neural network results do provide a lot of similarities with the language of thought hypothesis and it is reasonable to assume this as a stepping stone towards some greater support for the hypothesis. More work should definitely be done in this area (even if it turns out to only have the practical importance of creating better language translation programs). 

There is a point in ethics where the question stops being about "morally right" and "morally wrong" and it turns into "morally obligatory" "morally permissible" and "morally impermissible." Its not that "right and wrong" or "good and bad" don't mean anything, it's more so that they don't encapsulate the entire story just on their own. Morally obligatory means that the action is good and you, as a moral agent, are under an obligation to do that action. Remember that a moral agent is someone who has the ability to make decisions based off of moral reasoning and they can be held accountable for those actions. If someone is trapped under a car and you have the ability to assist them without causing any inconvenience or harm to yourself, many ethicists would agree that you are morally obligated to help that person. Morally permissible means that an action is not outright wrong. Some people make the argument that abortion is morally permissible, that is, it is not necessarily a "morally good" action to have an abortion but it is also not "morally bad". A large amount of people say that abortion in the case of incest or rape, or when having the child would have serious medical ramifications for the child or mother, is morally permissible. Morally impermissible is something that is not obligatory or permissible. Many people would make the argument that as a moral agent, if you went and murdered somebody with no provocation or any sort of rational reasoning behind it, that would be a morally impermissible act. They would argue that you, as a moral agent who is capable of reasoning about the ethical implications of actions, have done something that is not allowed by any rational thought about ethics. You took somebody's rights to their life away, you committed a horrible act and you understood the harm in doing so, so that act is obviously impermissible. There are obvious cases where it would be easy to say "you committed a morally impermissible act and that was morally wrong of you" but there are other cases, like your example with buying alcohol, where the act wasn't outright morally right or wrong, it was just a morally permissible action. As for animals, especially before contemporary thoughts on this subject, most people argued that animals are not rational moral agents. They argued that the animals don't understand what it means to be ethical, they can't reason within an ethical system, so their actions are not made as a moral agent. As such, we can't assign ethical values to their actions. An animal might kill to eat another animal, but most people would argue that the animal doesn't understand the concept of "murder" or "right vs. wrong" so its not that their actions are neutral, its that they aren't acting with moral agency, they aren't a rational agent. We are moral agents, we understand ethical reasoning and we understand, to a large extent at least, what is morally impermissible and what is morally permissible, therefore acting like an animal isn't an excuse to commit morally impermissible actions. A strict Utilitarian view is that we are morally obligated in every situation to do the action that maximizes utility (happiness, well being, or however else it is specifically defined). Again, a strict view would be that if you are given two options and one of them is morally obligatory, it increases utility more than the other action, it would be morally impermissible to do that action. Not all Utilitarians believe in the strictest view and some might see your example of buying beer as a morally obligatory vs a morally permissible action. 

I would just grant Nietzsche charity here since the excerpt is a literary writing. If it was the case he was making a formal argument word choice based on the historical context of when and where it was written and defined terms of the author would come into play. This may lead to people naturally object since most writings from philosophers are not formalized arguments. While I agree most did not make abounding volumes of formal arguments it is not to say the literary works are without merit. Instead I would suggest non-formal arguments as much weaker when it comes to their philosophical value, yet much stronger when it comes to pop-culture persuasion of the general public. Both approaches have merit, though it is my expectation that modern philosophers do double duty through the exercise of writing both formal and informal arguments for the position for the two audiences to make the strongest case possible. 

You can see that some of these do not use the term "only" so really we can't only focus on "only" in your example. Natural language is not modeled after formal logic and it is incredibly difficult to get the two perfectly in sync. Where the difference in "if" and "only if" comes from depends on if you're asking linguistically or logically. Linguistically, it comes from the word "only" which is, in English, the attempt we make to capture the essence of the logical principle we're discussing. If you mean logically, then the discussion needs to be shifted to a discussion about proof theory and formal syntax. In regards to 

This is a copy and paste from an answer to a similar question that was deleted; the question was "what is the relationship between "philosopher" and "philosophy", specifically in regards to a sentence such as "Maybe it doesn't matter but the philosopher in me wants to know." Sometimes words are used in non literal ways in casual speech. It is common for people to say something like "my general philosophy about money is to only spend it when I'm happy." In this example they aren't using "philosophy" to mean the actual academic philosophical study of economics and money; they are using philosophy to mean "a general set of rules I follow about the subject." Similarly, if someone says "the philosopher in my is curious about it," they mean that there's some sense of curiosity inside of them that wants to know the answer. That's different than a formal philosopher asking a question about, say, the ontological status of knowledge. In popular culture "philosopher" and "philosophy" are used to mean "someone who questions things past a surface level or is otherwise generally curious" and "a general set of rules or perspectives on a subject," respectively. These uses of the words are different than the actual terms used in philosophical discourse. If something happens, say someone has money stolen from them and they say to their friend "I need to find out who stole the money and why, it's the philosopher in me," they are not using philosopher in the literal, well defined, academic sense. They are using it in an informal, casual conversational sense. In particular, look at these dictionary entries for philosophy: 

Good question. Maybe if Kant would had access to our knowledge today would he would update his thought. He was a genius, no doubt. It seems to me that noumena [(in the sense they are the (supposed/.../presumed) things themselves, which we in lack of better concept so far, we say: reality] impose certain constraints to life which has got thinking ability and life with thinking ability responds to such constraints with a set of heuristics which moral/ethics/.../"what works" are examples and maybe are just byproducts of thinking ability. So, in the end if we eliminate free will we have to start to find another heuristic to deal with it and moral & cia are not enough for it. Now, with AI (artificial intelligence, which I prefer to name artificial integration) we just lost ANOTHER degree of freedom... so it is about time to think about the reduction of freedom implies in terms of the "next" heuristic... After all we are just algorithms producing biochemistry and bio-electrical signs. See for example the book of the picture... ☺
