I have just one thought to add to what others have said: Are you assuming that all human life is gone, or that just this one city has been abandoned? Because if there are people outside the city, you could expect the city to be looted and used as a dumping ground. I live near Detroit. Large sections of Detroit have been abandoned. People regularly break into empty houses and gut the wiring and the plumbing for scrap metal, as well as looking for anything else of value. Also, I recall a news story not long ago about how a certain abandoned neighborhood has become a place where gangsters dump dead bodies. (I guess it's good to have a designated place for things.) 

A longer year means longer seasons. Depending on how hot and cold the winters are, that could create hardships. A long winter means that people have to store up more food during the growing season to sustain them through the winter. Depending on other factors, this might mean multiple growing seasons during the spring and summer. If not, that could make it difficult to grow enough crops during the summer to make it through the winter. Tougher still for wild animals. A longer winter means more plants die during the winter, so there's less food for the animals. You could, of course, postulate hardier plants. I suppose an evolutionist would say that such plants would evolve, a creationist would say that a God who created such a world would create plants that can survive it, or if we're supposing the world was terraformed by advanced beings, they would create plants that can survive it. Longer seasons likely means greater extremes of heat and cold. Not only more hardship on people and animals, but would cause rocks to crack and create more erosion, glaciers to have more extreme ranges, etc. Rivers would have greater extremes of depth. They'd be more likely to dry up in the summer, and then overflow in the spring thaws. You'd have more "wadis" like you see in the Middle-East: water beds that are dry much of the year but wet in the spring (and during rainstorms). Of course these and any other factors someone might think of could be affected by other factors. Like issues caused by long seasons could be mitigated if the planet has less axial tilt and so the seasons are less extreme. 

I'd challenge the premise of the question. Capitalism is more environmentally sustainable than the alternative, socialism. Under capitalism, the land is owned by people, and thus those people have an incentive to take care of it and protect it for themselves and for their children. Under socialism, all the land is owned by the government, and so people have little incentive to take care of and protect any land. If they trash it, they can just move on to someplace else. In practice, which is better maintained: a rich man's estate, or "project" housing? The government may at any given moment be controlled by people who want to protect the land, but they'll have a hard time carrying that out when the people actually living on the land don't care. And at the next election the rich and powerful may get their people in office who will then give them license to ravage the government-owned lands, take whatever they can get, and move on. Also, in practice, corporations routinely have long-term plans that can extend for decades, while governments rarely plan beyond the next election. But all that said: Sure, if the people who own the land expect to live for a very long time, whether that's by improved medicine, brain transplants, or whatever, it stands to reason that they would take a longer-term view of things. Today a person who owns property has an incentive to take care of it for his own lifetime, and because he usually hopes to leave it to his children and he wants them to enjoy it. Of course some property owners have no children, or are selfish and don't care about their children. For these people, if they themselves will get the benefit rather than their children, that might give them more incentive to think long term. 

You could do it just like people navigate hot air balloons in our world: The pilot watches the clouds to see what direction the wind is blowing at various altitudes, and then heats the air or lets it cool to alter his altitude to a place where the wind is blowing in the direction that he wants to go. There are usually enough different air layers that he can find one with the wind in at least roughly the right direction. If not, you're stuck until the wind changes. Much like a sailing ship can be becalmed. Like see here, $URL$ point 7, or $URL$ 

This doesn't seem hard. I always thought it was pretty amazing that the U.S. won. I can easily posit one triggering event: Ronald Reagan loses the 1980 election. Instead the winner is a weak pacifist. Then the U.S. remains paralyzed and humiliated by the hostage crisis in Iran. The U.S. develops no strategy to combat the Soviets in Afghanistan. Afghanistan falls, and so the rest of the Middle East, already Soviet-leaning, becoming solid Soviet allies. Any that don't are invaded or subverted. The Soviet take-over of Grenada is unopposed. Emboldened by this, the Soviets, acting through Cuban and Grenadian proxies, take over other governments in the Caribbean, and then in central and South America. Meanwhile, the U.S. begins dismantling its nuclear arsenal while the Soviets give little or nothing in return, perhaps with the idea that this gesture of peace will somehow win over the Soviets, perhaps because the U.S. is outmaneuvered and/or duped in arms control talks. You can write a variety of endings to that story, but the general theme is a U.S. declining in military power and political influence until it cannot stand up to the Soviets. Scenario 2: The Soviets invade western Europe. They tell the U.S. that if it tries to intervene, they will launch a full-scale nuclear attack. The U.S. is not prepared to sacrifice tens of millions of its own people to save Europe. It engages in some face-saving gesture but backs down and does little to stop the Soviets from taking over all of Europe. This scenario seems eminently plausible to me. During the 1960s and 1970s there was talk of a "telephone war": the Soviets would call the president and tell him to surrender, and the U.S. would cave in rather than risk a nuclear war. I don't know if there's any evidence about what the Soviet government really thought at the time, but many Americans believed that the Soviets were much more willing to take casualties than Americans were. Many Americans believed that as long as the Communist Party was confidant that their leaders could survive in bomb shelters or remote areas, that they would gladly sacrifice millions of ordinary Russians if that's what it took to win a war. But the United States would not. Many people questioned at the time if the United States would risk a nuclear war to defend Europe. Many have said that the job of U.S. soldiers in Europe and South Korea was and is not to repel an attack, but rather to die, so that the United States would have to go to war to avenge their deaths. Scenario 3: Subversion. There were plenty of communists in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. It's popular today to laugh at the paranoia of Joe McCarthy et al. But in fact when the Soviet Union fell and westerners were able to access KGB files, it was found that most of the people McCarthy accused of being communists were, in fact, paid spies in contact with the Soviet government. One book I read claimed that literally EVERYONE that McCarthy accused turned out to be either a member of the Communist Party, a paid Soviet agent, or in contact with the Soviet government. I haven't researched it to find out if that's true. But it's clear that the Soviets did have a systematic program to plant agents in the U.S. government, and that even without that, there were plenty of Americans who were communist "true believers". It's not that hard to imagine that if these efforts, by Soviet and by American communists, had just been a little more successful, that communists might have taken over the government -- won a majority in Congress, elected a president, etc -- the U.S. could have turned communist, the two sides declared unity, and the Cold War ended with a communist victory. Harder to pick one single triggering event for such a scenario. Maybe this scenario is less plausible than others: more and bigger things would have had to happen differently. 

For any religion, there are going to be people who are very serious about it, who build their lives around this religion, and there are going to be people who don't care much, who will check the box for this religion on a form because that's what their parents were or that's what most people in their community are. If someone is nominally a member of religion X but barely knows what this religion teaches, goes to whatever worship services they have on major holidays once or twice a year, etc, it seems plausible that he could be easily converted to be a nominal member of religion Y. Especially if there is some benefit to converting, ranging from "if you want to get one of these high-paying government jobs, you have to convert" to "if you want to avoid being tortured and killed". 

I posted an answer in which I rejected your premise. Now let me post an entirely different answer in which -- for the sake of argument at least -- I accept your premise. What happens to the unemployed people? One: They starve. Two: There is some mechanism to provide them with a decent life. The government or private charities gives them money or provides free food and housing or something. Three: There aren't huge numbers of unemployed people, but rather everybody becomes partially employed. Maybe the average person works only 5 or 10 hours a week and that provides all the income they need for a comfortable life. Three sounds great, but given the premise may be the least likely. If robots are doing all the menial jobs so that all that's left are the jobs that require special skills that the robots are not (yet) advanced enough to do, than people who DON'T have management ability, or technical skills, or creativity, may be unemployable. So what do the unemployed do with their time? One: Creative things, like writing and producing art and music and inventing. Okay, arguably this is productive work, but the sort that machines are least likely to be able to do. You may or may not get money for it. Two: Improve yourself, so that you can become employable. If only people with creative or technical skills can get jobs, than learn to be creative or technical. Three: Improve yourself, not for the sake of being able to perform some job, but for its own sake. Study history or philosophy or science or whatever. Travel. Visit museums. Get together with friends and discuss great ideas. Four: Have a good time. Go to parties, concerts, and movies (or holoshows or whatever they have). Maybe this includes drinking and drugs and wild sex. Five: Join a gang. Spend your time beating people up, stealing and vandalizing, and fighting other gangs. Of course people could do some combination of the above. Realistically, some people just aren't capable of doing creative or technical work. Large numbers just won't be able to do One or Two. Many people would be bored by the idea of a life of endless study. People would probably talk about it as a good and worthy thing to do, but relatively few would actually do it. Like dieting and exercise. That leaves partying and crime. I suspect that's what most of the unemployed would do. Okay, it didn't take a lot of deep thought to come up with this list. It's pretty much what unemployed people in our society do, just multiplied. I've read books that imagine machines doing all the work and that paint a utopia where the people spend all their time producing great art and science. Bosh. Some would, but most just wouldn't have the inclination or the ability. The reality is, for most people, if they didn't have to work, they'd spend their time lying around doing nothing, partying, and/or fighting. At the other extreme, I've read books that imagine machines doing all the work and that paint a nightmare world of unemployment and starvation, with a small elite living in luxury. Also unlikely. Human nature being what it is, sure, there will be some of the rich and powerful who say to let them starve, but there will be some who care and look for ways to provide for these people. Throughout history there have always been greedy and selfish people, but there have also been people who devote their lives to helping the poor and weak. Furthermore, massive numbers of desperate people makes for a very unstable social situation. The rich would be in constant fear of riots. Even those who care only for themselves would likely see the solution as some combination of strict law enforcement and enough charity so these people aren't TOO desperate, so that they have something to lose if they challenge the system. If the society is really so rich -- I mean the robots are producing so much wealth -- that there is just no need for people to work, then presumably there is enough abundance to let the unemployed have at least a basic, decent living. Reminds me: According to the Bible, the law in ancient Israel was that when a farmer harvested his crop, he was supposed to leave a little behind, and the poor were then allowed to collect this. So the rich provided food to the poor, but the poor still had to go to some effort to collect it, nobody brought it to their door. Perhaps in a society such as you propose, factories would have places where they'd dump their slightly imperfect items, or some percentage of their production, and the poor could come and take it.
