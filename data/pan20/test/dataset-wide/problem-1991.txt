Let the recruiter know you received a competing higher offer but you are still very interested in their company. Ask if they might have any flexibility to compete with the other offer. Tell them that given the long-term financial impact, you need a day or two to think about it. 

I have been in this situation before and when I discussed my concerns with ownership, I was shocked that they took the side of the people who were hurting productivity and morale. I've since moved on to greener pastures, but in today's economy I know sometimes staying put and putting up with the nonsense makes the most sense. What I've found is that if ownership does not care, you cannot make them care. You can try, but generally that works out badly for you. Unless the ownership has enough respect for you that you can chirp in their ear without hurting your career, I think your choices are to accept things as they are or look elsewhere and move along where your motivation and "higher standards" will be an asset and not a detriment. 

Depending on the position, a lot of companies won't consider non-local candidates at all. On the other hand, if you have advanced / renowned / specialized skills they may be happy to fly you in and put you up in a nice hotel just for the interview. You could look for job offerings that specifically mention a willingness to relocate candidates. Go on-site at least once before accepting any offers. There are some things you just can't tell from skype. Or if you're sure you know where you want to be, if at all possible, I would move first and look in person. If you can't afford to do that, try to schedule more than one on-site interview in the same city during the same week so you can check out multiple opportunities on a single trip. 

You wrote "Since our corporate credit cards had expired the week before, they told me to use my own credit card. They also said to decline the rental car insurance as it was covered under their corporate agreement." How did they tell you this, do you have it in writing? If so, I imagine you have a very good leg to stand on, that you just followed orders and therefore the company is liable. Even if not, you still have a good argument, especially if the person who instructed you is willing to admit it / unable to refute it. I suggest communicating with your insurance company about the situation - speak in hyptotheticals until you're ready to file a claim. Since chances are they would rather not pay and raise your premiums, they may go to bat for you against your employer regarding liability, and they likely have the lawyer resources to get it resolved quickly in your favor. Ultimately this battle is between your insurer and your employer (your premiums increasing is just collateral damage), and if your insurer turns out to be strong and gets your employer to admit liability after gathering the facts, your employer shouldn't hold that against you. 

I am a web developer for 1 year in a company, and i am undergoing a very complex work/life balance situation. To keep in short terms: i accepted this work, moving from my home town to a bigger city, in order to build my life and everything (i am 26 years old now, i was 25). But my lunch break lasts 2h, and at the very start it was ok, the major sacrifice was travelling for a total of 4h a day. But now that i am here i still not have the time to live my life because of it. Most of my colleagues go home with their cars, while i don't have a car and neither i have the money to buy one; i come here with a bike because is faster and for sure less expensive then public transportation like bus. My company isn't really in the center of the big city, but in a town smaller than my hometown; it's not hard to reach, 20min with bike, but moving near my company just for this is not an option since i will lose the main factor of living in a bigger city with all its benefits. So: i want to ask for a lunch break reduction, i need 30min to eat. I think that it last so long in order to keep as long as they can the employers in the company for some right reasons like meetings and assistance. But in this role, especially my position where i rarely speak with my colleagues such is relaxed (like, 15min a day and for things that are not even important) my phyisical presence here is useless, and it cannot happen to have an emergency where i am required at the end of the day; it never happened and it never will since i just don't have that type of responsabilities. But still, even if i know that there's no need for me to stay that long, and proven that i really need to come home earlier in order to restore some work/life balance to not get crazy (i am 26 y/o), and that i don't want to come home in the middle of the day (especially for the risk of going around without many bicicycle paths, but it's anyway tiresome) i think that this is a very unprofessional thing to ask, since "everybody's the same under the same roof". So how can i ask a lunch break reduction to my administrator (which is not the boss, but his wife)? EDIT: I ask to the administrator rather then my boss because she handles all the papers realted to hiring process and so; but she is more hard to convince then my boss. Actually when i was in the traineeship i asked for a reduction of 1h because of the long travel (4h) but when i became an official worker she said "you will be like the others, no matter what". 

I am Mark, a 25 y/o web developer living in Italy and i am currently working in an electronic company doing a web application for contacts management, i also give some help to marketing office creating landing pages and this kind of simple stuff. Actually this is not the job of my life since this situation is "temporary" (even if i am doing web development from when i started here 10 months ago) and i should do embedded software with C++, but i want to leave and find a place where i can really do web development with other people and have chances to learn more, since here i work alone with no help! But on job listings, one thing that i always read is that, both in Front-End and Back-End development (i am doing both here), companies always look for developers who could use web frameworks. Actually i don't need a web framework for the project i am doing and also for the projects at home, i am self-taught and i prefer to write personal clean code using basic tecnologies (html, css, js, php, mysql) and Jquery. I can't also really understand the difference between one framework and another; it kinda looks like to me that's a choice for the project manager, and there are a lot out there so that i can't really decide what to pick! So i wanted to ask: Why web companies are looking for people that can use frameworks if that's a thing that should be decided depending on the projects? Are them really important if i want to find a new job? I am stuck, since i want to apply as a junior webdev but i look like an entry-level since i don't know frameworks, but for me it makes no-sense to learn a hyped one (like Angular) randomly! I wish i could learn the framework that the company is using rather then random ones, thanks to my actual basic skills, but it's like climbing a smooth wall. ON HOLD: I didin't know where i could have asked this question. I thought in programmers, but this is not a "conceptual thing about programming". The bad thing about these reports is that it is told what "is not ok" without nothing else to improve. I will try to report this in meta. 

It might actually turn out that the candidate had very few managerial duties and for most part was a developer. As many people stated already don't read into the titles too much. I was a "Head of" at a very small company, but I for most part was the only person on the team with nobody under me. 

In my experience, in start up culture, all nighters or staying late happens. Things come up and they need to be dealt with. It is nothing special. That's why I wouldn't put it on my resume; it is nothing special. 

If for a given position, you can create near work environment do so. For example a white boarding problem for software engineer. The candidate will (almost always) make sub-optimal choices, this gives an interviewer an insight into how candidate handles suggestions or criticism. If the candidate overly defends their suboptimal solution, or ignores the interviewer's suggestion it is a red flag. I believe the above is a better approach than prepared questions because, the interviewer can observe the candidate's reactions to actual criticism, not just candidate talking about criticism. 

You don't have to ask this question directly. Unless candidate's resume explicitly states that it was a managerial role. 

If you are interviewing with a small company (start up), show up dead on time. There is no receptionist, you will cause disturbance if you show up early. Don't walk into a company space 5 minutes early; it is too early. Some small companies have shared lobbies, and you can be as early as you want, because your contact will come to pick you up when they are ready, that's a different story. 

If there is a useful tool that his not using point him to it. I am certainly biased to text editors, and tried to write scala in vim, but I was quickly pointed to IntelliJ, and even though, it has different mindset, and somewhat of a learning curve; I am much more productive with it. Therefore, point him to the best tools you think he misses. Don't force him to use it, just suggest him to try it. If he refuses to even try, that's a red flag to me, looks like a hard person to work with. If he tries it, but is not more productive with it, then you will at least understand why he is so "old skool", some people get confused by easy to use interfaces, I am a bit like that. Maybe you can put him on tasks where there is user interface to work with? 

1) Say that you have seen FizzBuzz before. 2) Do the most straight forward solution. 3) Mention that you know about other witty solutions. Some interviewers might be interested in them and some not (I would not be). The problem with going for a witty solution is that it almost guarantees that FizzBuzz will take more time than it should, and you might not get to or have less time to get other must get problems.
