I was searching for an article on fairness in a couple of online encyclopedias but had no success. There seem to be entries for various sorts of justice though, like the two I came across: distributive justice and procedural justice. I'm assuming there are other ones as well? Anyhow, as I understand it, fairness and justice are not exactly the same, the former being more subjective and depending more on gaining the satisfaction of the parties involved and the latter being more about decision being made according to certain ethical/moral/legal principles. This is of course my limited understanding of it, and I'm aware also of a lot of overlap between the two, as those ethical or legal principles can be created with concern for what people consider what is fair, and vice versa, people might accept something as being fair partly because certain decision was reached by impartial people who were guided by these ethically guided principles. But where does this leave me with philosophy of fairness? Does it become a psychological question, something purely subjective, like an empirical question about what different people consider fair? Is it a question of deserving, with its potential humanistic or religious dimension of human worth and value? Does the answer depend on culture and society, on politics, on economy? And on and on and on.... I appreciate any suggestions or references to help me 

Relative to sciences, measuring (or defining) progress in philosophy seems more complilcated. I also presume that more so than in sciences, what pushes a particular philosophical view/approach out of the mainstream may not be directly related to its merits as a theory but be due to other factors like sociopolitical ones (e.g. philosophy of religion). But of course, it could be that the nature of the problem is such that no meaningful progress can be made at this point in time (consciousness?) And so here my question is whether progress in ethics has been made. Myself I imagine there has been some, because even if there are (and will always be) disagreements about values, we can still make progress by logically working out the consequences of adopting some, check how coherent the particular ethical stance is, etc. And what about all the recent work on animal ethics, is that not progress forward from the philosophy of human rights and that too being progress itself? At the same time, I am aware that many religions and older philosophical systems hundreds of years ago too had their views about proper treatment of animals and people too and that it may be merely a reflection of our time and place (me in US in 2000s, for example) and not sign of philosophy's progress that this kind of work is being done now. In other words, progress in applied ethics and not other areas. Anyhow, appreciate your views. 

This is a really oddly worded question. It seems as though it's equivalent to "What is the purpose of meaning?" and moving it up one level to "'What does the purpose of meaning?' mean?"doesn't really change the question. To answer it, you need satisfying answers to "purpose" and "meaning." Here's a shot. 

As a living thing, one has preferences, which are "states or situations that one seeks above others." "Purpose" is the relationship that a given person, object, event, or idea has with the thinker's preferences. It's shorthand for "the use that the subject under discussion has in seeking the preferences of someone else." Unless specified, that "someone else" is "the speaker, or an imagined person based on the speaker." Preferences are either biological urges (oxygen, food, water, sleep, breeding, heat) or personal values (learning, interest/fun, justice, confidence/achievement/respect, personal relationships, or freedom). These things will be different depending on who the "one" is in statement #1. "Meaning" is inseparable from preferences. An object has meaning to us only if it affects our preferences. That doesn't mean that we can't care about impractical things, since interest/fun is a huan value, only that nothing wholly disconnected to our values can have meaning to us. Meaning is inherently relative, which I know is a word that most of the kind of people that care about philosophy hate/fear. It is, though. So, meaning means "the effect that something has on one's preferences," and purpose means "the use that something has on our attaining one's preferences." They're closely linked. One step further, if we consider knowledge itself as but one more tool to seek preferences, than the distinction between meaning and purpose collapses totally. However, that's not really satisfactory, right? So, let's go at it from a slightly different angle. A thing has meaning if it affects our preferences, which means if it helps us decide what to prefer or helps figure out how to get them. How does it do that? The biggest obstacle to attaining one's preference is ignorance, ignorance or which preferences are best and ignorance of how to get them. A mind or brain can be said to be smarter if that mind or brain is better at making predictions about the future than some other mind or brain (the same one a year ago, for example). You're smarter than someone else if you are better at making predictions than them about something that you both regard as worthwhile. People make predictions by assuming that the future will be like the past to the degree that it is similar to the past. Of course, that also means that the future will be different from the past to the degree that it is different from the past. Making a prediction, then, involves consulting one's mind and trying to find the closest match one has for the situation that one wishes to predict, and then making corrections for the way in which that past situation is different from the to-be-predicted one. No two situations are identical, of course, and so this is an inherently imperfect science. So, the meaning of anything is simply where the mind stores it. First, it involves placing it in a category of other things that share one or more attributes, and then distinguishing it from everything else in that category.* The important thing to notice here is that the process of making predictions is analogous to the process of defining a term. This isn't accidental, of course, because things have meaning to us to the degree that they help us make predictions about the future. So, the relationship between meaning and purpose is like the relationship between blueprints and building materials. However, since we can regard the blueprint itself as a tool, meaning is can also be understood as a subset of purpose. Categories, though are imaginary groupings, and in saying that meaning can be seen as a subset of purpose, can be is a key phrase. 

It's a fallacy. I don't understand the user who says it's not. Although I'm not sure what it's labeled. It might be the genetic fallacy or perhaps a kind of false appeal to authority. This person is basically making questionable assumptions and implying they're factual: That if you are a girl, then you would understand "girls problems". Not that you would have these problems, or experience them, and not that you would understand your own specific problems as a girl, but that you would understand "girls problems." Nor is this given as a kind of probability (based on, say, the idea of familiarity with problem is more likely to give you understanding of it). No, you're not told that you may not but that you simply "can't". Before I proceed, I should note that this fallacy is quite common in its more general form. For instance, does your doctor have to be a smoker to understand your problems as a smoker? Do you have to be disabled to understand a disabled person's problems? Could a Muslim scholar possibly know more about Jewish people's problems than your average Jewish person? For a researcher to write a paper on homeless children, does it require that she have been homeless as a child herself? But I don't think the mere experiencing of some issue, or familiarity with it, for instance me as a man being exposed to messages in the media about what a man should act like (e.g. not talk about feeling, etc) somehow makes me actually understand these problems. If so, then I would refuse to read a book written by a female psychologist who tries to help men understand their problems better. But I would read such a book if her claim to "understanding" is based on actual authority and expertise, having studied and conducted quality research the issue (there are other criteria too, but let's not get into that). In my view, it is also fallacious to talk about "girls problems" as if all girls shared the same ones. While there are naturally some similarities, there is also a lot of variation. Just as a black man in Manhattan has experience and understanding of racism that is likely different in important ways from a black man living in Freetown (Sierra Leone). In fact, what is more surprising to me is how often very similar people living in similar situation seem to have different perception and understanding of what seems to me to be the same problem. I like to end on a lighter note. It's not (generally) a crime to commit a fallacy. :) Sometimes people say one thing, mean another, and what we actually perceive is yet another thing. Language is not exact and people (myself included) are not very careful with what they say. It may be that the person here had none of this in mind and was just reacting to what may have been an unsympathetic comment. You're probably thinking, "Some lighter note...the guy ends by accusing me!" No, I'm just saying that whenever we analyze a fallacy based on a single comment, it's limited. We need context to truly understand the tone and intention. But as it stands, it can serve as an exercise in logic. It'd be fun to analyze political statements (which are much more carefully worded) and it's shocking how much fallacy is out there.
