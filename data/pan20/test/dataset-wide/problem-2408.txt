Supposedly it is used to help meditator fight drowsiness. It is said that drowsiness comes from stiffness, from meditator trying to artificially restrict their micro-movements and to severely narrow their scope of attention. While right concentration is said to feel open and flexible, with body actively balancing in meditation posture and attention wide open (but not engaged nor scattered). When supervising monk sees somebody nodding, he reminds meditator of the need to expand their awareness, by gently "massaging" the shoulder with the stick :) 

I don't see tantra as "harnessing the power/energy of taboo acts". First, working with controversial subjects like alcohol, meat, sex, theft, lying, and killing is a relatively small part of tantra, I would say no more than 1/10th or even 1/20th, people just tend to exaggerate it. Second, I don't believe these subjects are worked in order to harness their taboo energy, but rather to help the practitioner go beyond some of the deeper-lying preconceptions that may be hiding in the dark corners of psyche easily accessible through controversial means. For example, if someone has residual anxiety of emotional intimacy and openness, sex may be prescribed as a practice that involves direct open contact with another person. Same with drinking feasts, which may be prescribed as a practice of sincere communication etc. There is also symbolic/metaphorical component to tantra as @Bakmoon said. In this line of thinking, "having sex with everything that moves" symbolizes "naked" (open, sincere) engagement with the world and "killing one's father" symbolizes abandoning the tendency to self-judge and watch oneself in favor of trusting one's fundamental sanity. 

Yes, the Brahmavihar compassion is meant as an antidote for jealousy and feeling of being rejected/wronged by the world. Generating compassion puts one into an elevated position, so one can feel better. 

Believe it or not I had exactly same problem back in the day, and I used to smoke cigarettes then, which is why I asked if you were a smoker. I had these nagging sensations in the throat, surprisingly they were somewhat pleasant, as in I actually enjoyed what felt like warmth and movement in my throat. But sometimes they were getting slightly too strong and it worried me. It all started as my self-awareness increased as a result of my Buddhist practice. I did not meditate back then but did apply serious effort to practice mindfulness. Around the same period of time I felt increasing disgust to the smell and taste of tobacco products. As my self-awareness grew, I kept enjoying the sensations in my throat but did not want to experience the smell and taste in my mouth. Also, my head started spinning a bit too much after having another cigarette. So at some point I started to reduce the frequency and amount I smoked, until I quit. I never applied any force, never used nicotine patches - it just happened by itself, through awareness and disgust and some head spinning. As I quit smoking, the throat sensations have briefly increased, and then were gone forever. I'm not saying your case is the same, but perhaps it's not entirely out of question that your awareness of your body has increased as a result of your meditation practice, and now you feel what was always there but you simply did not notice before. In a way, this could be interpreted as your throat talking to you: "please stop smoking". Might as well listen :) 

Dukkha comes from mismatch between "what is" and what you think "should be". Keep repeating this until it sinks in :) 

Although the interpretation of the wheel as depicting the cycle of death-and-rebirth is accepted by most schools, according to Triyana framework it represents the basic/literal ("hinayana") level of understanding. Instead, some instructors, including Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, taught twelve nidanas as a process of gradual individuation, or emerging and hardening of the illusory ego. In this line of thinking, is the innate ignorance, s are the arbitrary imprints of sensory stimulation, is inductive intelligence born from the imprints, are inductively postulated external objects, six s are the implied "windows" onto the world, is a subjective experience of contact with the postulated objects, is a sensation attributed to the contact, is an obsessive replay of the contact and sensation, is feeding the obsession by making its object one's goal, is becoming the "this" of here-and-now, dependently-co-arisen with the twofold "that" of space-and-time, is identifying with a living organism, and is experiencing the organism's perspective culminating in death. (Because the list shows subjective experience, not an objective physical process, the physical birth is not shown, but if it were, it would fit right before Ignorance. The Birth that is shown, is not a physical birth, but conceptual (subjective) assumption that one is an individual living organism.) Although 12 nidanas explained this way describe subjective experience of one sentient being, which begins with physical birth and ends with death, we could say that after death the cycle logically "restarts" from scratch, again starting from ignorance, progressing through individuation, and culminating in death of another "being" and so forth indefinitely. To be sure, objectively there is no cycle, beings arise and cease asynchronously, but in some sense we could say that death of a (unenlightened) being is a return to innate ignorance. @ChrisW found a tremendously elegant quote in Wikipedia: 

Before I became Buddhist I did a lot of random "spiritual" practices, including "astral travel". The later is when you try to retain "waking" consciousness as you fall asleep. I only had mixed success with the various techniques for achieving that, but the one that worked more or less well was to relax the body and completely refrain from any movement until you lose all bodily sensations. So effectively you let the body "fall asleep" while keeping the mind awaken. The major difficulty for me was (to avoid) getting overexcited at the moment the body falls asleep - which (overexcitement) resulted in hyperventilation and loss of control. Eventually I realized that establishing lucid mind inside the dream was easier for me than carrying it over from the waking state, and so I dropped that frustrating practice. Another related technique I had better success with was doing the Four Immeasurables type meditation at that same moment of falling asleep. This works better as you don't have to artificially restrict body movements, which seems to go counter to deep meditation in my experience. 

In Vajrayana, there are also reasons against celibacy, particularly if you are the kind of person who has fears around sexuality and intimacy. If that is the case, your teacher may prescribe sex as a kind of spiritual practice. 

Lay practitioner ==> monk is not a one way street. Some monks renounce their vows for various reasons (not always bad). A famous example in Western Tibetan Buddhism is Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche who ordained in 1947 and renounced in 1970, but kept teaching in lay status all the way until 1987. He still sat on a high platform and enjoyed the same honors as an ordained teacher. This is less about your official status and more about your spiritual achievements and realizations. As Buddha himself said (AN 5.166), 

There is , this life is not without ("wrongness", "trouble"). Dukkha must be understood. Dukkha comes from superposition of "that" and "this". "That" is a desirable possibility, object of unsatisfied thirst. When a desirable "that" emerges in the mind, "this" co-emerges as undesirable, Dukkha. From emergence of "that" comes emergence of "this". When "that" does not exist, "this" does not exist. From cessation of "that" comes cessation of "this". Dukkha has been understood. Dukkha depends on factors, is not without its factors. The key factor of Dukkha is "Thirst" -- unrealistic clinging to "that", or irrational attachment to "this". The Thirst must be let go. The Thirst has been let go. Dukkha is subject to disbanding of its factors, is not immune to disbanding of its factors. With disbanding of factors of Dukkha comes cessation of Dukkha. Cessation of Dukkha must be realized. Cessation of Dukkha has been realized. There is Path to cessation of Dukkha, cessation of Dukkha is not without a path. Path must be actualized. Path has been actualized. 

Dukkha must be understood for what it is. Among the conditions responsible for the arising of Dukkha the unsatisfied thirst is a necessary condition. In the absence of the unsatisfied thirst Dukkha does not arise Here is how the thirst can be eliminated, step by step, from coarse to subtle. 

Great question. From Mahayana perspective "things" do not "end", nor do they "change" - because separate self-identical things are imputations of the mind. In reality things do not have firm spatial and temporal boundaries. Things do not by themselves have identities that stay unchanged throughout their lifecycle, allowing us to designate it as "still the same thing, just changed a little". These identities are chosen by us. So to speak of any "thing", "ending", "changing but still staying itself" - is a simplification. Ontological reality has nothing like that, it is totally up to observers to define "things" in space and time. How do we "see things as they are" then? We see them with our "wisdom eye" (wink wink). We remind to ourselves that what we see is not all there's to it, until we are used to seeing it all. For a trivial example, when someone dies, we say: it only looks like this person ended, but that is not true - there are children, books, students, flowers, social influence - whatever imprints they left on the world - it lives on. When we practice this enough we get in the habit of seeing "energies", "influences", "connections", "processes" behind things. We no longer see separate things, we see the matrix - and that's called "seeing things as they are". From Mahayana perspective, this is the real nature of Impermanence: everything is continuously in flux, but the mind grasps after "entities" that it itself designates, and then gets upset when these imputed entities morph beyond recognition, like the cloud figures. 

As I explained in "Is samatha meditation more suited to lay people than vipassana?", the factors of "being good", "feeling good", "calming down", "understanding", and "liberation" are designed to support each other. In Mahayana, it is generally understood that the exact path depends on the student's propensity. People of intellectual type are better suited for "understanding"-first paths. Simple people caught up in the drama of life, are better suited for "calming down"-first paths. For most people in between these theoretical extremes, there is a mixture of "understanding" and "calming down" developed in tandem, with slightly more accent on one or the other, depending on exact situation. For people of extremely brilliant intuition, there's the fourth path of cutting through directly to suchness. Again in real life these "extremely bright" students do not exist. There is usually some combination of study and practice required to remove all doubts. The general principle here is that the coarsest / biggest / most obvious obstacles should be removed first. I think it was Thrangu Rinpoche who went as far as to say that we should work on them one at a time, completely focusing on the worst mental/emotional/behavioral issue until it's resolved, before moving on to next. 

Is this aversion? Yes, of course. "Doesn't feel comfortable" sounds like a kind of aversion. The keyword is "comfortable". An attitude not rooted in aversion would sound like "I stopped going because I saw it having more harmful effect and little beneficial effect" - see the difference? As my last teacher explained, any time we feel strong aversion to going somewhere / doing something - we should take a really good look inside to see if the feeling comes from a deep-lying preconception. Preconception (in this context corresponding to sankhara) is an abstract formula we have adopted based on some previous experience, some sort of wrong overgeneralization we cling to. A complex of preconceptions constitutes person's ego, or image-of-self-and-the-world. Buddha compared ego with banyan tree that grows by shooting down the prop roots (=preconceptions) which become the second-order trunks and so on.
