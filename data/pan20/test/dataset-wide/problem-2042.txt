It's hard to answer this in general since it'll depend somewhat on the industry and type of employer you're going after. There are certainly markets where the portfolio will (or will not) be very important, and I don't think it depends on the length of experience (per your indication that you seemed to believe it was more important for people with less experience.) That said, I'm going to base my answer on the comment you made above, where you clarified your question: 

How often do you convert internships into full time positions? How mobile are employees within your organization? What support do you have internally for career development? Are there tuition subsidy programs for supporting further education? Leadership development programs? Support for certifications or professional training? 

The person they speak to will realize how completely ridiculous the prior boss's actions are, and will dismiss her claims. You've lost nothing here, and maybe some day it'll make for a good tale around the office about how your crazy ex-boss tried to pull a fast one. The person they speak to will believe her, and will treat you worse as a result. You're eventually fired, or treated poorly and leave on your own. Take this as a bullet dodged: you probably don't want to be working for someone who would actually listen to the rants of a random ex-boss. 

You have correctly identified that recruiters often screen resumes for content within a specific domain. They tend to pass on generic resumes that don't exhibit a domain focus. The good news is, you can do something about this problem. There are actually several things you can do: 

When considering salary - especially when comparing against "the job market" in general, and trying to make a case for a raise - it's important to consider the entire compensation package and work environment. In other words, the company's value to you extends beyond the number on your paycheck. Yes, the "average" salary for your position in the open job market may be 20% higher than what you make, but the "average" employer may have worse benefits (retirement, PTO, working hours, etc), worse work/life balance (after-hours calls, expectation to answer email from home, etc) worse culture in the office (demanding bosses, uninteresting projects, etc). When you're weighing your current situation against hypothetical situations elsewhere, you need to decide for yourself what the value of these other factors is. So, to answer your questions: 

I'm going to write an answer combining portions of the two previous answers, since I think they both have merit, and the original poster may be misreading some of the implications in them. 

First, we need to establish: under what premise is the car being provided? Sometimes, "company car" indicates a vehicle provided by the employer, strictly for performing job duties. Other times, the same phrase can mean a vehicle that is provided for job duties, plus for the employee's personal use, as part of a compensation package. This is a significant difference in terms of answering your question, because it gives us the terms against which you would decide if (or how) to negotiate the specifics. If you're being provided a vehicle strictly to perform your job, you don't really have much ground on which to negotiate for a "nice" vehicle. The employer is basically responsible for providing a vehicle that gives you the transportation you need, and engine size or fancy options aren't really going to come into play (because as has been pointed out in comments, you can get from A to B with a basic car the same as with a fancy one). If, however, the vehicle is provided for personal use, as part of your compensation package, then you and the employer need to agree on the terms under which the vehicle is selected and provided, the same as any other type of compensation - vacation days, salary, etc. In the question, you stated, 

You mentioned open source projects. If you're not already doing this, find and contribute to open source projects in the domain where you want to work. Include your open source portfolio on your resume, and describe the projects you're working on right on your resume. On your resume, when describing the work you're doing that is outside of your target domain, focus on the tasks and quality of your contributions rather than the domain. For instance, instead of describing how you wrote software for routers, describe how you worked within an Agile team as role X, or you contributed to the standards for QA or whatever non-domain-specific description you can come up with. On LinkedIn, find employers you're interested in, who operate in your target domain, and follow them. Find the thought leaders (people giving TED talks, posting leading articles, writing interesting blogs, etc) in your target domain, and follow them. Comment on posts you find interesting. Share articles you notice, and describe why you found them interesting. In other words, build a publicly-visible history of interest/participation in your target domain. This way, when a recruiter looks at your LinkedIn page, they see a bunch of on-topic content, instead of an uninteresting, generic profile they can't relate to. 

First, always be honest. This doesn't mean you have to tell everyone all the bad things you've ever done. It just means, don't lie. If you were fired for moonlighting, don't tell people you quit because you wanted to travel the world. When asked, focus on what you've learned. Inevitably, in an interview, people may ask why you left a specific position. Don't just tell them you were fired - be prepared to explain what you've learned, and how you've changed. Be ready to show this through results (ie if you were fired for a specific reason, hopefully you now have some other job experience after that point where you can show that you didn't keep repeating the same mistake). Be prepared to explain results in a potential background check. Background checks will vary from employer to employer and region to region, but generally they will check employment history - a recruiter who receives a questionable result may follow up with you - be ready to answer in line with my first two points - be honest, but show how you've changed. Don't get caught off guard by these questions. 

Neither of the situations you described in your post are inherently "bad" in the long term sense. To put this another way: They are both valid reasons to decline right now, but still be a potential candidate in the future. 

If you'd like to determine this before the interview, it's very reasonable to ask the recruiter during any pre-screening that takes place. I wouldn't phrase it as "I don't want to waste my time flying in for an interview" since that might come off as a little egotistical (although it's a perfectly legitimate reason). Phrasing it as a matter of overall fit is appropriate. It's worth noting that coming to a general understanding that salary is in the right ballpark is arguably an important part of the prescreening process, so it's totally reasonable to ask. This is also the reason why the employer is asking you what your number is, at that point in the process. If you're curious about overall negotiation tactics, there are lots of good questions on that topic. Searching on the job-offer and negotiation tags will get you a lot of reading material. 

It's hard to answer because we don't really know the culture of the organization you're working for or the specifics of the internship program you're a part of. That said, it does sound like the employer has some degree of flexibility since they already granted you a request to change the length of the internship. If you are planning on asking and want to try to reduce the chances it's perceived poorly, you can try to tailor your request: 

This way, you're showing that you're a problem solver who can think in business terms versus a developer who only thinks in terms of a specific, narrow set of languages. 

I'm going to repeat something I've said in many answers. Hiring is a sales process. You, as an applicant, have something you're trying to sell (yourself: or at least, your ability to perform a job). The way you accomplish this is by using sales tools: a resume, a job application, a cover letter, references, and (maybe) a portfolio of work - ie a github account. When evaluating how you use these tools, you must focus on the fact that they're tools to facilitate a sales process. To get to your specific question: 

If you're having trouble finding employment because of a serious offence in your past, consider looking for assistance. In many nations, there are "back to work" programs designed to help people with criminal histories become productive employees. It's hard to give specific feedback on this without knowing your location and/or what you did in the past to get you fired, though. 

It can be hard, as a job candidate, to essentially say no to something a potential employer is asking for, but if they push hard for you to give them information you're not comfortable sharing, you have to ask yourself: Do you actually want to work for a company that is essentially playing dirty right from the start, when trying to negotiate your salary? There are always other jobs out there... 

It actually was toxic, which they couldn't really hold against you, There was some sort of mismatch on soft factors (ie fit, style, etc) which might or might not really be a problem (depending on if the same mismatch would occur at the new employer), or Because the employee was the toxic one - problematic employees don't usually say "I left because I'm toxic" 

When people ask "is X going to reflect badly on me?" or "is X professionally acceptable?" my gut reaction is always, it matters as much how you explain X as what X is. Go ahead and move back to your prior employer. When working on your next move at some point in the future, think about the following: 

Of course, there may be complications. Maybe your boss isn't actively in the picture. Maybe they want you two to "just figure it out." Even if this is the case, you still have an opportunity to seek guidance. Approach these conversations with facts, objectively, and make it about overall productivity/opportunity/contribution - not just "I don't like XYZ types of work." Don't make it about your coworker's other behaviors (kingdom-building, going to meetings, etc) unless you can objectively make the conversation about impacting YOUR performance - in other words, don't go to your boss and complain about your coworker. Go to your boss and ask for help being the best employee YOU can be. 

(Typically) there's one person in the company responsible for setting an employee's workload and priorities: Their boss. You've stated that this coworker is not your boss. Unless other arrangements have been made, your workload and assignments are a discussion between you and your boss - not you and this coworker. To answer your specific question: 

You need to keep in mind that you're trying to get potential employers to hire you, not your former employer. In other words, to address your first concern: 

If your desired salary is way above their number, they don't want to waste their time interviewing you, under the assumption that you wouldn't take their offer. If your desired salary is way below their number, they now know that they can save money by offering you your desired salary instead of the number they already budgeted for. 

If the candidate wants to work for the company, the question is really broader than this specific LinkedIn message. What is the candidate doing to develop relationships with people at this company? How does a response (or lack thereof) to this specific message fit in with the candidate's overall strategy? If a candidate is targeting a specific employer, a message like this may be a golden opportunity to establish a relationship - even a minor one - with an important decision maker (a recruiter) at the target employer. I had a mentor once who taught me to "never waste a crisis." When you see something that you're worried may be perceived as bad, instead of focusing on that bad, look for a way to turn it into something good - developing a relationship with the recruiter, in this case.
