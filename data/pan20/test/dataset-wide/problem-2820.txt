What's more, Wittgenstein makes this argument explicitly with his "Beetle Box" thought experiment (in the Philosophical Investigations.) And, what's more, he also shows that much thought is not of a propositional nature, and does not work well with traditional notions of epistemology; one cannot be mistaken about having one's tooth ache. 

The question, I imagine, comes down to what we mean by "consciousness"; it seems pretty well established that bees make use of symbolic communication. Are bees conscious? 

I think we can refine the terminology a bit; we generally speak of entities existing, and events occurring. Now, existing usually implies persistence through a duration of time; occurring, on the other hand, is often momentary. If a tree fell in a forest a million years ago, that event (the falling of the tree) occurred, by definition. The fact that the tree no longer exists, and there are no recoverable traces of the occurrence (or the entities involved in the occurrence) is completely irrelevant. How do we know the tree fell in the forest? Because we just stated that the tree fell in the forest. Taken from the other side: if we refuse to stipulate that the tree fell, we are left asking "What events occurred in the past that we have no means of knowing about?" to which the only possible answer is "We have no way of knowing, by definition." 

I think that's precisely what Searle's argument is getting at. Our intuition tells us that the room does not understand Chinese; therefore, an algorithm performing the same functions as the room does not understand Chinese. 

That may or may not be the case, depending on how we are reading "A". We certainly can determine whether or not some given (sensible) entity is identical to itself, if we have stipulated the identity conditions for that entity. If we are dealing with A as an abstraction, we are beyond the scope of sensibility and are relying on pure reason. In other words: there are differing notions of epistemology and truth in play. Falsifiability applies to empirical matters, but is not appropriate to mathematics or pure logic, where the canons of logic are applied to non-sensible abstractions. The process of determination of whether or not a given statement is "true" is going to vary based on the type of statement and the epistemological framework chosen. 

Agrippa's Trilemma demonstrates that all systems must ultimately be grounded in one of three way: infinite regress, circular reference, or unsupported axioms. So, ultimately, you are going to have to resort to one of those options. Reliability, then, is generally redefined appropriately. To give a more detailed answer would require reference to a specific philosopher or philosophical tradition. 

Well, to begin with, that's a terrible misquotation of Aristotle. What he actually wrote was the following: 

This is a large question, and can be approached several ways. First, at the broad level-- there is a widespread misconception that Western philosophy is rational and Eastern philosophy is mystical. This is false, but it is false in an interesting way: there is a fascinating book on the subject by Thomas McEvilley called The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies. For a taste of the contents, McEvilley has made a video describing his research here. Suffice it to say that both the Western and Eastern philosophical traditions contain both rational and mystical elements. Now, more specifically: although the basic principles of Indian logic (for example) are largely identical to classical logic, the formulation of the details are somewhat different-- such as the 3-step syllogism familiar to us being replaced with a 5-step variant. Of course, there are deviant logics in both the Western and Eastern tradition, but these are special cases. 

There is a movement known as P4C (Philosophy for Children) which collects and develops resources of this type. You can read more about them here. There's also a Wikipedia page on the subject. 

Unfortunately, before we can go forward, we need to unpack some of the assumptions lying behind your question. To begin with: measure the soundness of what? Arguments of some kind, of course-- but are these formal arguments, or natural language (i.e., rhetorical) arguments? If they are formal arguments, as soon as there is a logical fallacy, the argument fails. Additional fallacies don't make much difference; it is like a mathematical proof with a erroneous step. If, however, you are speaking of informal arguments, i.e., arguments in natural language, then the fallacies that you are speaking of are rhetorical in nature, and don't actually invalidate the argument at all. They fail to support the argument, but don't undercut it from a logical perspective (although they may make it less persuasive psychologically.) Note that this very question demonstrates the problem that we are dealing with. Much depends upon how we interpret the terms "argument" and "fallacy"-- whether we are speaking of them in the context of formal logic, or in the context of rhetoric. This ambiguity is a hallmark of natural language arguments, and necessarily so: words have meaning in context, and the context is never completely saturated. In other words, attempts to apply the tools of mathematics (ratios of fallacies to premises) are bound to fail, as there is no way to unambiguously count premises or fallacies, since their recognition depends upon an interpretive process dependent upon context, and that context (in an non-formalized structure) cannot be sufficient for epistemic closure. 

There is a God, who is omniscient and omnipotent (axiom) The Bible is the Word of God, and represents God's message for mankind (axiom) Therefore, the stories of the Bible must be important (from 1 and 2) Some of the stories in the Bible are trivial, and appear pointless, in contradiction to #3 Therefore, at least one of our axioms is false. 

I think a better way to frame the question is "Is a theory that is not falsifiable (in practice) useful?" Put this way, I think the answer becomes more clear. If we adopt Jamesian/pragmatic terminology, we can say that the "cash value" of a scientific hypothesis resides in its testability (and the reproducibility of the results of that test); without those, it remains merely a thought experiment. 

I'd argue that all of these are cross-cutting concerns, and are astride the aforementioned categories. For example, it is quite easy to identify an Existential metaphysics, an Existential epistemology, an Existential aesthetics, an Existential political philosophy, an Existential philosophy of mind, and an Existential ethics. (There's no need to identify an Existential logic, as Existentialism doesn't make any claims regarding logic that are at odds with classical logic.) In fact, I could name individual works by Sartre on each of those topics. And this is as it should be. If we were expecting to slot philosophers or schools into your major categories, in which category would we place Kant? Aristotle? 

As others have suggested, the best alternative is to take a college class. If this is impossible, I'd strongly recommend Jay Garfield's video series on "The Meaning of Life". It's not cheap, but Jay's a brilliant scholar and an excellent teacher (I studied with him a few decades ago), and the course is a great introduction to how to read philosophy. 

Well, it's hard to prove a negative, so let's just say this: he fails to appear in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, an almost 10,000 page reference work. As a point of comparison, we can point out that the REP includes 3 pages on Anna Maria van Schurman, who was (apparently) "among the few women to publish views on Counter-Reformation controversies concerning predestination and transubstantiation. Her autobiography served as an apology for the Pietist sect, Labadism." In fact, it appears to be rather hard to come by any information on Schuon that was not published by his own press; one of the few independent reports I found was a report of cult-like behavior, and charges (later dropped) of sexual abuse of minors. 

I think you are misunderstanding Kuhn. The fact that a geocentrist and a heliocentrist can both give the same description of the orbit of the planets is precisely the point-- they are two different explanatory mechanisms for interpreting the same data, yet the "incommensurability between the new and the old theory" is clear. Similarly, Einsteinians recognize that Newtonian mechanics are just a special case of the theory of relativity, but Newton didn't see that himself. Re-read Kuhn, and ponder more. 

First, a small point: I don't know of any "West Asian" antecedents to the Eternal Return; if you have a citation, please pass it along, as it would be interesting to find out about. Second, it is not by any means clear that Nietzsche would have had to have been "a fool" to believe in the Eternal Return, and there are certainly passages which would indicate that he did believe it (more than as a thought experiment). It's far from a foolish position-- if you accept a materialist universe, in fact, it is a likely side effect; if we posit (like modern physicists) that the universe began with a Big Bang, one would presume that whenever the necessary conditions for such an event arises, another Big Bang occurs, which would play out deterministically in exactly the same fashion, etc. Nietzsche makes this reasoning clear in some of his notebooks (minus the reference to the Big Bang, of course). Now, as to the consequences of the thought experiment: you'll find almost as many varying interpretations as there are readers of Nietzsche, but he makes explicit that he is aiming at a notion of amor fati, that one should live one's life as if each moment were holding the force of eternity; a nice literary examination of this "heaviness" is found in Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where the weight of the Eternal Return is contrasted to the lightness of believing that every ephemeral moment only occurs the once. 

No-- it means that from a phenomenological perspective, the cognition is the same. In classical Indian philosophy, the canonical example given is that of mistaking a coiled rope for a snake. One looks and sees a snake, and later one looks again and realizes that it was not a snake at all, but a coiled rope. The two perceptions have the same status with regard to the mind, they are experienced the same; one happens to be veridical, and points to an external object which exists in the material world, and one points to a presumed external object which is not actually present in the material world. In other words, the snake exists as a perception, but does not exist materially. 

Actually, it's a great deal more complex than that. There are a large number of conceptions of nihilism (a few of which are listed here), and they all share one important attribute-- it is almost always a term attributed to someone else, to argue against. You'll be hard pressed to find someone declaiming and defending nihilism per se. 

I don't think your comparison is apt; Cicero (to use Gibbon's example) had an entirely different project than Hitchens and Dawkins. Whereas the latter take on the task of arguing for atheism and against religion, Cicero was by no means an atheist; in De natura deorum he has characters describing the theologies of the Stoics, the Academics, and the Epicureans, and whereas the last-named are atheist, he does not endorse this position in particular (nor does he reject it.) In short, Cicero takes no stand against the religion of his day, so his taking part in the public rituals is by no means hypocritical; his commitment to the probity of reason is not an obstacle to participation in the church. Nor is Cicero unique in this regard; it is worth remembering that Darwin regularly attended his local parish church. So, I don't think you've provided any evidence that hypocrisy was treated differently in antiquity than it is today. 

That's not inaccurate, but it is a dangerous way to put it, if we don't qualify the terms. "Inherently real" here has a specific meaning--it means "existing from its own side" (as the Tibetans put it), or, in Western terminology, a substance. As Spinoza put it, "By 'Substance', I understand that which exists in itself, and is conceived by itself, i.e., that which does not need the conception of any other thing in order to be conceived." So, a substance inherently exists in that its existence is not dependent upon any other thing. So, the cup on my desk does not inherently exists, as its existence was dependent upon a factory making it, etc. 

It superficially appears to be empirical, but is somewhat different than empiricism as traditional constituted, because of the inclusion of the intelligible. It is an eminently defensible position; I don't know off-hand of any philosophers who dispute it (although there may be some I am not remembering at the moment.) 

First of all, complex numbers (and imaginary numbers) do appear in real-world phenomena; they have lots of practical applications. But now, on to the philosophical portion of the problem. Numbers are abstractions. They don't exist in the same way that, say, physical objects exist. You can give me two apples, but you can't just give me a two. As abstractions, they follow certain conceptual patterns. For positive integers, these abstractions are fairly intuitive; for other types of numbers (such as negative numbers, or rational numbers, or irrational numbers) they are less so. Your question mentions the square root of -1, but let's take the square root of 2. Does that number "exist in the world" in any meaningful way? Can you give me the square root of 2 apples? Fortunately, this doesn't hamper our ability to use the square root of 2; from a philosophical perspective, we can do this by adopting a position known as Fictionalism-- in short, we can treat numbers a fictional objects, and substituted them into formulas without making any ontological commitments as to their existence. As long as the substitution satisfies the constraints (which is to say, in a broader context, is adequate to the phenomena) we're golden. So, to answer your question: we don't have to rationalize that complex numbers exist. It doesn't matter if they exist or not. EDIT: I found an SEP article that specifically treats of Fictionalism in Mathematics; it is a nice reference for the more specific case.
