Back in the day you could buy clamp on stops and guides for derailer cables. I would think you can still find them, either as NOS or maybe somebody is still making them. Sure enough here is a page full of them at BikeParts.Com. 

Once you have the chain untangled into a single loop remount the rear wheel. The chain should run from the top of the chainring in front over one of the cogs in the rear and hang in an arc as it returns to the chainring in the front. Now you can remount the derailer. The chain will pass over the jockey wheel nearest the rear cogs and then drop down to pass behind (around) the tension wheel before returning to the chainring - I suspect that your friend removed the tension wheel (the lower wheel on the cage) to remove the derailer, it may be still out, but if not remove it so the chain can pass around it. Good luck! 

Before you do anything else, confirm that the axle is properly seated in the dropouts. Unless the dropouts are resting solidly on the axle on both sides the wheel will be slightly cocked and it is likely that the disc will drag. Working on a bike stand it is particularly challenging to get the wheel properly into place – you need about three hands to hold the wheel in place and adjust the skewer or tighten the nuts on the axle. So it could be that you've got it right, but the bike shop had the wheel slightly off when they adjusted the brakes. The easiest way to check is to briefly take the bike off the stand and with the bike resting on the ground loosen and the reclamp the skewer. If everything is right (as far as you can tell) I'd be inclined to take the bike back to the shop and have them check it over. When you do be sure to remove and replace the wheel to confirm that it stays right this time. 

In the photo I've pulled the rip open, if I let the pannier relax there is just a small slit, as if someone tried to slice the pannier open with a knife. Is this something that can be reliably repaired? 

The trick to working with an arbor press is to support the hub with something so that you have a space into which to press the bearing and axle. Sockets often work, as do pieces of key stock. 

The general answer is, "yes, you can change chainrings" – chainring is bicycle talk for the front sprocket. The more specific answer will depend on the actual crankset the bike is built with. There are some that don't make it easy to remove a chainring or where replacement rings are hard to find. To know for sure you'd want to have the bike in hand and check – unless you know the make and model of the crankset that comes with it. All of that said, I think it would be a good thing to hold off for a while on changing anything. In general (again) pedaling at a higher speed (meaning higher RPMs which cyclists call cadence) is easier on your knees and overall endurance. So I'd encourage you to experiment with the existing setup first. At 70 RPM, which many would consider to be on the low side, your top gear (42x12) will give you about 32 km/h (20 mph) and up at 90 RPM you'd be doing 40 km/h (25 mph). Those are respectable speeds on the flat. Downhill you'll be able to go faster (if you want to), but at some point you'll "spin out" and find that you can't pedal fast enough to push the bike any faster. If you do decide that you want more speed (or more speed at a lower cadence) then you have two options: 

Often what people mean by binding in a chain is the link is tight and doesn't flex freely. You'll can sometimes see it when the chain does a bit of a hop as it goes are round the cogs or the derailer, or even on the chainrings if it is bad. The fix is to gently flex the chain from side to side (perpendicular to the way it flexes around the cassette and chain rings) at the stiff link. 

Start by checking the tension on the spokes of your wheel. To do this you'll need a spoke wrench that fits your spokes. There are lots of fancy tools for the job, but all you have to have is the spoke wrench. Within reason, the tighter the better. Ideally what you will have is even tension on all of the spokes on one side of the wheel. There are fancy tensiometers to show you what you've got (and very effective and inexpensive apps for smart phones like Spoke Tension Gauge), or if you've got a good ear you can pluck the spokes like a guitar string and get an idea of how even the spoke tensions are by the pitch you hear. This is especially important on the rear wheel where the gear cluster means that the hub isn't symmetrical and more tension is required on the drive side (right) spokes to keep the rim centered and true. If the drive side isn't tight enough, then the non-drive side will be too loose to support the rim adequately. One way you'll notice that the spokes are too loose is that you'll hear "pinging" noises from the wheel as you ride. With disc brakes you can get away with a lot of wobble in the wheel, so I'd really encourage you to try it yourself before having a "pro" work on your wheel. It is fun and kind of meditative – just remember that everything affects everything else, and once the wheel is getting up to tension it makes sense to make balanced changes – tighten one spoke and loosen the spokes it pulls against. If you want to know more about building and working on wheels, see if your library has The Bicycle Wheel by Jobst Brandt, Sheldon Brown also has posts on wheel building and truing and other repairs. 

Basically what you want to do is to get stronger – you want to be able to ride in a higher gear at the same cadence. There are a number of ways to work on this, one is to push yourself hard(er) on hills. What has worked for me is to find a hill that feels relatively easy in a low gear (for me this means that I can comfortably ride the hill at around 80 rpm). Then I'll try the hill in a higher gear (a cog or two higher in the rear, still using the small ring in front), pushing myself to keep my cadence up. I'll do this until my legs and/or lungs hurt, then I'll coast down the hill and recover. Then I'll do it again. Maybe four or five times. Then I'll go for a nice ride :-) I think the formal name for it is something like interval training or hill repeats. The idea is to work yourself hard enough to get your heart rate high and trigger release of growth hormone. The growth hormone tells your body that it needs more muscle. It must figure out somehow that the tired muscles are the ones to grow… The weight of your bike, is a mixed blessing – for absolute performance it definitely hurts – it's more weight that you have to carry up the hill, but on the other hand that same extra weight is helping you get stronger. I'm sure someone knows how to do the calculations, but my gut sense is that it is not a huge difference. 

You can definitely do this. Take a look at something like the Nitto Albastache bar that Rivendell sells – or peruse their handlebars section and see if there is something that looks better to you. 

Your current weight is at the high end of the limits Trek puts on their bikes. Here's the relevant section from the Trek FAQ: Rider weight limit of 300lbs: 

Very occasionally my chain will come of the small chainwheel on a downshift. It is not at all predictable, except that it always happens when the I'm doing an unloaded shift in preparation for a climb. I don't think it has ever happened under load. The limit screws seem to be set correctly. Most (>99%) of the time I can shift onto the small chain ring without any problem – both under load and without a load. I'd appreciate suggestions for what to check or ideas about what could be causing this. 

You don't mention where you're riding, or what "level" your tires are (the ThickSlick tires appear to come in a variety of builds with different amounts of puncture resistance), so it is a bit hard to comment on the problem. If you're riding in urban areas where there is glass or other damaging materials on the road, it could be that the tires just aren't durable enough for the conditions where you're riding. They seem to be a relatively light tire, compared to, say, a Schwalbe Marathon. Next time you get a flat take the time to really look it over, you need more evidence to figure out the pattern. As suggested, mark the puncture and work methodically – you want to remember what you did so that you can see the patterns. Here are some specific things to look for: 

Found a few sources by searching on "compact 7-speed freewheel" – here is what Sheldon Brown / Harris Cyclery has. The claim is that they will work, perhaps with the addition of a thin washer or two if the clearance is tight around your dropouts. The appear to have new (or maybe NOS) Sunrace FW760 (13-25), and Shimano FW722 (13-28), and a FW723 (14-34) freewheels in stock. Nashbar has a 13-24 and a 13-32. It appears that Amazon has some sellers with some as well. Hillary Stone in the UK also has some, both NOS and used. 

I have a B.o.B. Yak trailer which uses a ISO 305 mm BSD rim. I'd like to build up a wheel for the trailer using a dynamo hub (perhaps a Sanyo H27) so that I could have lights on the trailer. I know I could use battery lights, but I've become very fond of not having to change or even think about batteries (a lot of our biking is "car replacement" rides around town, so it is really nice to just know that you've got lights). Seems like this would also give me power to charge a phone or other small device since the draw of a rear light will be well below the capacity of the dynamo. A wheel built on 305 mm rims is going to turn just about twice as fast as a wheel built on a 622 mm (700C) rim. My impression is that the output voltage of the hub increases with speed – and that the output of modern hubs are regulated. So I'm wondering what issues I might run into using a dynamo generator as a power source. Some that I've thought of are: 

One last thing, it isn't the length of the ride that dictates when aerodynamics comes into play, it's more the speed (either your speed or the speed of a headwind). At 15-20 kph I don't feel like I'm working too hard against the wind, but up around 25 kph I definitely notice it (but not enough to make this old man want to spend much time of the drops), up past 30 kph the drops are looking very attractive. 

Practically speaking? Assuming that the "virtual geometries of the bikes is similar (in other words if you measured the bikes as if there was a horizontal top tube), the big differences will have to do with fit. You have three choices: 

So far you goal is to figure out if you can make the frame fit you and to spend as little money as you can in the process. Don't go out and buy a "comfy" saddle or a fancy new stem – just use what you've got and figure out if you can make this frame suit you. Check around to see if there is a bike shop that sells recycled parts – if you need to get a different stem, used is the way to go while you're sorting out what size you want. Also some of the better bike shops will guarantee the comfort of the parts they recommend to you. That can be the way to go if you decide you need a new saddle or some other expensive part. When you're done here you should have a bike that you can comfortably ride for an extended ride (well more than your 5 KM commute) or clear ideas about what parts you need to change to make the bike fit well. With that done, here's what I'd look at next: 

It would help if you could post a photograph, but what I'm picturing from your description is that when you shift onto any of the three largest cogs in the back while you're on the large chainring the derailleur cage is pulled almost horizontal and the jockey wheel disengaged from the chain. To me, this sounds like your chain is too short. Since chains don't magically shrink what I think happened was that when you put the wheel back on the bike you pulled it further back in the dropouts than its original position and now the chain has farther to go. So, I think all you would need to do is to move the wheel forward in the dropouts. All of this assumes that you have horizontal dropouts, if you have vertical dropouts I'm completely wrong… 

Something is dragging as you pedal harder. The most likely thing is that your rear wheel is moving so that the tire drags against the chain stay when you apply power. This is something that you'll probably need to troubleshoot when you're riding because it isn't likely to show up with the bike on a work stand. You might be able to make it happen by applying a standing load to the pedals while holding the front brake. To do this I'd want somebody holding the bars to stabilize the bike (and to help me look for what moves when I load the chain). The interesting thing about what's happening is that you say the problem goes away when you ease up. If the problem is due to the tire rubbing on the chain stay then there must be some mechanism to return the wheel to its neutral location. The only thing that I can think of right now that might do this is a nutted rear axle where the nut on the right (drive) side is loose enough to allow the axle to move under load and then move back when the load eases up.
