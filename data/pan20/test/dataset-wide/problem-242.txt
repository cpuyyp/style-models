How can those processes be easily drawn upon to create realistic looking maps? From a bare tectonic map you have rock-type information. You also have basic heating information and major wind currents that can be modeled based off the bare tectonic map. Precipitation can be modeled to get base moisture levels. Basins are already present at this point in the geologic structures, you can use a gaussian blur to extract a scale-space representation of the basins and sub-basins that you can use for segmenting if you don't already have that information. You can use the preceding information to develop the information for soil types and biologic population. These will effect soil quantity and fertility, which will decrease erosion in general, increased precipitation and moisture levels, as well as increase erosion on selected soil types in the presence of certain species (trees will break down craggy rock quicker). Higher populations will reduce the anti-erosion effect of plants and increase mechanical wear. 

The literature can use different names for the same erosion. It also tends to have a seperate name for processes that can be easily grouped. As a result this is a distilled summary of major erosion processes. What are the processes that reshape land-masses and alter the terrain after it has initially formed by geological processes? 

A BEC can be used for quantum computation and it might exist under the crust in neutron starslink. I don't know if the additional structures required for computation on the BEC could happen by chance but they could certainly be added by a creator. As far as plasma beings. I agree with @kingledion and plasma rings seems to support. You could always do computation with collapsing structures as well, Ã  la Chemical Computer. 

For the record some animals practice kleptoplasty to gain photosynthetic powers. But beyond that: Why aren't animals photosynthetic on earth? 

There's many factors that go into a good armor but let me throw some bullet-points out. These all must be considered at the very least: 

Assuming that a majority of Humans come to live offworld, what is likely to be the most widely agreed upon way of time-keeping? Over the eons, measurement/calculation of the Planck length would give us a smallest unit of time, we would almost certainly redefine our second as a multiple of this smallest unit. We would use seconds as a universal standard and an agreed epoch to start counting from. At the moment this is the Unix Epoch. Given rising computer word sizes as well as storage space, this would probably eventually be adjusted to an absolute and invariable reference such as the birth of the universe. Universal Time would probably be separate from Local Time and use powers of the base to track passing of time. At the moment the base we use is ten, it could possibly be different in the future. Local Time would reference the nearby cycles and scale up in cycle length and importance. Local Time would be used everyday as significance could be attached to a particular "hour", etc. Universal Time may be the Local Time if there are no cycles of importance (they must have regular cyclic importance) this seems more likely in "uploaded" individuals, especially if they have no internal cycles. For the uploaded individuals they may move towards using the smallest unit of time as a "second". Mostly because the second's status as a base unit is because the time-scales and reference point are relevant to us. If we get to the point of fitting a whole day's thought into the space of a second we would necessarily redefine the "second" possibly adopting a new name so we could keep the old one. The necessity is best seen when looking at schedules. Looking at an itinerary "Call Home @ 5:30" doesn't make sense if 1/24 of a second feels like an hour, you would necessarily redefine the hour to 1/24 of a present day second, or perhaps adopt entirely new measurements. On a closing note its probably best to observe that our units have changed over time. While not much because of historical inertia, when you leave history behind and visit the stars you lose that inertia holding you back. 

Could this actually work? Yes, but it's highly situational. As your total perimeter size increases (number of infected and size of them) it becomes less viable to quarantine in an enforced way, which is the only way you'd want to do. Zombie concentration and smaller areas lend more to air-strikes and will consequently lead to less quarantine activity. When its all blown over the infection sources may be post-disaster quarantined to prevent another outbreak. Even if its the least likely for a given scenario, as soon as someone discovers a way to save the victims (even if it only works for a little while) expect quarantine measures to show up. 

Resulting in: Without resorting to gravity manipulation (in which case at that scale you could probably tackle any problem facing your world with technology) your hardest one is the rivers. Just a spinning shell wouldn't work in this case as there's no force to drag a floating river back towards the shell. A very fast spinning sun could maybe work by the pressure exerted, this could help stabilize the sphere as well. In order to "launch" a river you'd either need an area with much weaker gravity or a shell that has more inertia than your water. Both require your shell to be higher density than water at the very least and preferably much denser. In order for mining to cause a loss of atmosphere (gradually I'm assuming) it needs to go somewhere. Since digging a deep pit would tend to fill it, that could be the entire cause if the atmosphere was relatively thin. To launch a river your shell would be tidally locked which would force fresh rain up a mountain. The tidal locking would prevent extreme mixing of the atmosphere and could allow some Earth-like layers to develop. Then the problems: 

In general gaussian blur is from dispersion and bleed effects (its the solution to heat.) Gradients are used to set up constants (insolation, etc.) Averaging and blurring can mix multiple season and years into one overall climate despite periodic flux. Smearing in a direction (NOT directional blur because that goes in front of the mountain as well) can give you rain shadow effects. A Dijkstra Map/Distance Transform/Grassfire/Eikonal Solution/etc. can get odd things like distance around a mountain or distance to the nearest set of _____. I'm assuming we already have a height map. If we don't then Voronoi Regions/Stained Glass/Mural/Cobblestone Effects give us segmented regions. Actual basins are simply Voronoi regions mapped to mountain ranges and fractally nested inside each other. To get the crinkly look from actual plate movement you'd need Distortion/Displacement/Glass Maps. Primary rain erosion can be modeled by throwing random noise scaled by moisture intensity, etc. River carving and a whole mess of other things can be modeled using the first derivatives of your maps (which is the gradient). etc. QGIS was mentioned and goes with GRASS GIS and a lot of other open-source GIS. It doesn't do a whole lot along these lines but it can be interfaced with R. So there's probably a program out there for everything you can think of and some you can't. If you're not in the mood to code something from scratch but know how to run a compiler you can try doing searches for Fortran, Astrophysics, and Geo-etc. as most of the physics have remained the same, so all the good programs are old University code. Blender and Rhino (and Houdini?) can be used in a similar way to GIMP/Photoshop but to greater effect. (We drop some error as we move from a flat representation to a globe. We can also actually just outright do some things like place the sun and model an elliptic orbit). EdGCM was apparently developed as an educational but full functional climate-modelling tool by NASA (it supposedly also doesn't kill your computer like some other newer climate-modelling software). Gocad looks amazing although I haven't tried it. 

If you wanted to build a space hotel, say with 500 rooms, how many people (excluding hotel guests) would have to be permanently on that space station? For a solitary exclusive luxury hotel: 

While other answers have pointed out various limits that are realistic I thought I'd point out there's a "loophole" if you will for each of them. 

Yes, to a point. It would last longer, I couldn't begin to say how much longer though. If we look at progression in weapons, wars got longer and longer between equal powers while battles, if anything, got shorter. WWI was a big long affair because of trench warfare and that has to do with high firepower, relatively low mobility, and an imperfect mix of ranges as far as I understand it. Similarily long, The Cold War and likely any other WMD War to follow are long protracted affairs but are a little less "warlike". So you probably will hit a cliff at the WMD level where things happen instantly if allowed. Much more likely though is agreements banning such weapons and a cycle back into longer warfare styles. With superhumans you can't just ban things though, so if their power levels get to WMD then its up to the individual if they use it and level the playing field and wars do get shorter. 

What significant technologies would be lost in a world without "Advanced" Mathematics? Specifically, what technologies required to get to the next level of scientific progress in an area would be lost. Your largest constraint is algebra. The humans on this world can count to small numbers, they can perform addition, subtraction, comparison, and other mathematics operations below the level of multiplication and addition on whole integers, you may consider variables as part of our working algebra set and zero may or may not exist. I realize some basic Chemistry might be possible and that tinkering with ratios might lead to division since a ratio can be expressed that way, yet it may also be ignored like the number zero in our own history. So unless something explicitly requires more advanced math it is not removed as a possibility. Modern Chemistry, however, would definitely be removed as we play with algebra too much. Geometry and Logic as areas of Mathematics have special consideration. Logic can be formulated without advanced algebra, although its level of utility and formalization may depend on it. Geometry is constrained to matching shapes and lengths as well as other things that are capable of being eyeballed. Anything beyond that should be kept to a minimum. As a good test to constrain your technologies, ask if processes can be done via a "match" unit versus a unit requiring conversion. If you can directly perform comparisons it can be done with minimal math. Conversion of units however requires multiplication or division and is not allowed. 

And that about covers Temporal Ethics. The entire discipline can be said to be composed of Temporal Physics, Ethics, and Risk Analysis. The main question can be said to be whether Temporal Physics changes between time-lines and if it's possible to influence the current time-line. A universe that has not answered these questions satisfactorily will argue philosophically about paradoxes, certainty vs probability, etc. and frame them as ethical questions affecting the lives of entire universes. If enough is known these questions will fade and all we'll have left are the unanswerables: Is existence intrinsically good, etc. Which could only hope to be answered by some complete description of everything. Temporal Ethics will thus consist mostly of pointless philosophical debates of both sides of the coin on the various issues. Mainly because the physics cannot be trusted unconditionally, and when it is trusted it raises questions that cannot be answered. (Like does it remain unethical for you to choose a "goal" that is unethical from your current-universe's frame of reference if it isn't in the new universe? Does an absolute frame of reference for morals exist (god, etc.)? And so on... basically the really big questions of standard ethics are the only ones that matter for temporal ethics.) 

If you have raw materials instead of ores and a source of coal everything can be developed. Wax, paper, and electroplating can be used to build a circuit board if you feel it's neecssary. A solder iron could be made from a leather wrapped iron rod with solder being homemade (lead and tin alloy?). You can cold work your way to the tools and material shapes you need after you cast your initial hammer head and anvil from iron. If you spent about a week each on: 

Hardness and mass tend to hand-in-hand material wise. So you could go with a tank-like creature. Alternatively something akin to a slime with special skin would work as well. Mix and match if you need protected areas (skull for example). Other options exist as well. 

So I read the linked page to get on common ground with you in terms of understanding how your scalons are supposed to work. On that note let's debunk that page: 

Evolution happens on time-scales that are of far greater magnitude than the length of time our current mediums can hold information or any other evidence like buildings. Buildings and landfills break down before intelligence really shows up. CDs are an exemplary back-up medium, yet they only last 20 yrs without degradation. Which means you gain no benefit from an intelligent precursor species over an unintelligent one. Time taken to evolve intelligence is highly variable. Intelligence is not a foregone conclusion. For example, if any of our germ aliens ever end up existing I doubt we would place their evolution to intelligence as anything other than improbable. Humans being gone would only change how the variables in the ecosystem are set. Extinctions from transplanted species probably drops, stable ecosystems have a better shot at staying stable longer, etc. 

You could rig a scenario where only one species evolved and survived. If your ancestor species died out due to an environmental change you could have a singular species. This would ease pressure and allow you to stay stationary evolution wise. You would need some way to keep them stationary on autotrophism though, so they didn't branch out into another species through random mutation. Two ways I can think to do this are DNA repair on (or more likely above) the level of Deinococcus radiodurans and/or being on a local or global optima for the environment. You could still have genetic variation as long as it was for minor traits, but a smaller gene pool like in Cheetahs would be ideal. As others have pointed out, sentience requires a high price in energy and so civilization may be a large leap even with these constraints. You would require an energy source rivaling fat and protein, as well as pressure to evolve sentience. I would imagine photosythesis would need to be better than any we currently know of, on top of having something like smart carnivores in your prehistory to drive evolution. 

From your intro we have: There is a somewhat complicated history...While humans were figuring out agriculture...in the Aquila rift...(Archivists attacked)...a few centuries after...(we have Celestials)...(over) a thousand years (from the Archivists' attack)......(Everything is quiet)...(Industrious) spent a few millenniums in hiding (and then kicked butt)...(so over a thousand years is actually a few milleniums (3+)) Which gives us a timeline: 

As far as technological progression: Since they can manipulate atoms your would jump from LHC size to nanobots instantly. Same blueprint, smaller hardware. Any increasing stresses could be handled directly by scalons hooked into Zero-Point Energy for power needs. As far as reality warping face-offs go: If you're reality warping with scalons then quantity, control, and application determine your power. 

If sunlight was red then the red sun would be long living allowing evolution to progress longer on that planet. That sun would have been born before our own sun as well, so if compared to the current Earth Date then an Earth-like planet could easily have life that's been around way longer and maybe more advanced. If sunlight was red the sky most likely wouldn't be blue. Problems involving gravity would put a livable planet farther away from the star which creates its own problems. The reduced energy from a bluer spectra would probably not provide the necessary amount to support life which raises issues if we consider the sun to not be a contributing factor of the redness. Our red light would follow a black body curve centered on red, so the plants and animals wanting to reflect the light would be cyan or blue, and would blend towards white as they reflect more and more sunlight. Ones wanting to absorb the light would be red and blend more towards black as they absorb more and more light. Green always has a more efficient alternative so there would be no pressure for green and probably very little of it, if it appeared at all, Colors as viewed by the natives would probably be viewed in shades of red due to the lack of other color components in the sunlight. Similarly the rainbow would be red-shifted. A red sun could be cooler than our own and last much longer allowing life to evolve to higher levels. Solar heating would decrease faster with distance so the net effect would be that the sun would appear much larger in the sky (probably at least twice as large). The decreased strength of sunlight would place limits on the food chain. Less species in a web means more specialization and less burden. Less input energy means less plant growth per unit area. Less growth means slower metabolisms, tricks to find food, and longer lives have selective pressures. Low metabolism, slow-paced (culturally), long-lived, intelligent creatures would be selected by evolution (k-selection). Note that intelligence would be more likely to develop. Vision would be adapted for red. This means the natives would most likely see in shades of red with maybe some yellow mixed in for shades of orange. Likely their visible spectrum would be shifted to see infrared and so heat would be visible to you average creature. This may help accelerate intelligence or hinder it on caloric, etc. If it was useful to distinguish between plants and animals that might use the other colors they could end up with a visible light range similar to ours, plus heat vision. The increased likelihood of predator and prey both having heat vision results in typical camouflage adoptions not being very effective. You might see more fauna with thick fur and similar features, to insulate their heat signature.
