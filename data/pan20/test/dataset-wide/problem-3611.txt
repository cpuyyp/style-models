Where are you getting this information? Unless you have some sort of muscular dystrophy, you can ALWAYS build muscle. It doesn't matter if you're building it for the first time, or re-building it for the tenth. Why would lost muscle mass be lost forever? 

In many countries, if you have a documented case of a disease which is related to heat intolerance, you would be able to deduct things like air conditioning systems as a medical expense if your doctor prescribes it. But barring all those worst case scenaria, and looking to more practical options, drink plenty, and I mean plenty of water! Profuse sweating will dehydrate you over time. Wear light cotton clothing (it breathes). If you do suspect that there is an underlying medical cause for your issues, you absolutely should visit a doctor about it if you haven't already done so. 

If you're a complete beginner, I'd recommend 2-3 days to start with. And a full body workout is fine. Do the big compound lifts, rest for 1-2 days, and come back to it. If you do a full body workout for 4 days per week, you may start to feel perpetually fatigued after a month or two. Especially if you're going to take bodyfat and dietting seriously. 

What you're describing is, in my limited experience, the most frequent beginner's issue with the free-stroke. Suffice it to say, I had the same problem when I started out. This answer will be largely based on my own experience, rather than classical training methods, since I had to learn it by myself. That said, you seem like a proficient swimmer, so it's likely that by simply keeping at it, you'll intuitively grasp it. I'm going to assume (since you didn't specify, but mentioned early fatigue in legs) that you're experiencing the same problems I did, where your upper body is keeping afloat, but your legs are sinking, thereby causing you to use far more energy than needed to keep them up. For myself, I noticed that the reason why my legs were sinking, wasn't how I was moving them, but the fact that my arms were pushing straight down into the water before they pushed backwards. This downward push, pushed my torso UP, which resulted in a non-flat body position with my legs suddenly lower. This, repeated, was one of the issues. Focus on pushing the water backwards right away. Another issue is kicking with your knees. This creates a lot of drag, as well as up-and-down motion. You should keep your knees straight, and might even benefit from improving ankle flexibility. Then, there was a tip I was getting from another swimmer, because it was very obvious. My head tilt. I was looking straight ahead, at the wall I was swimming towards. This is ok if you're already very proficient. For beginners though, it might cause legs to sink. Instead, keep your head in a position where you're looking straight down. The point here is that you lower your torso and level your body. 

I used to weigh 62kg before I started training and dieting, and I now weigh 87kg. Let me just start by telling you that this is your life now. It's hard at first, but you get used to it. Dieting to gain weight is something people think is easy, because we've all heard the complaints from people trying to lose weight. They have to go hungry all the time, and eat small portions of boring food. Well, for those of us who want to GAIN weight, we have to eat lots of food, even when we're not hungry, and eat until we're stuffed and then continue a bit more. Same same, just opposite. Yes, it's going to be hard. Just as hard as those people who complain about wanting to lose weight. But the diet seems perfectly healthy. Warning You say that your PT is a "nutritionist". This is a huge red flag! I am also a nutritionist. I have NO education in the field, but I am a nutritionist. This is something anyone can call themselves, because "nutritionist" is not a protected title. In English, the title of "dietitian" is protected. It implies education and graduation in the field of nutrition and regulation of diet. Since your name looks hispanic, I'm going to assume that you live in a Spanish-speaking country (and I apologize if this is wrong). You have to find out which title is protected in your country. If you DO live in the US or another English speaking country, then I'm sorry for bringing this up. Then it's simply nutritionist (bad) and dietitian (good). 

You should see a physical therapist and find the root of the problem. If, for example, it is caused by a shortened hip flexor, you will need an elaborate therapy plan involving some light workouts with focus on stretching. This is not something we can create for you on this site, since we don't know your entire situation. 

I assume from this part that you workout just before lunch? Again, missing a lot of information here. 

Yes, this is absolutely possible. I suggest you top off your workouts with a good full-body stretching routine. You can find a LOT of stretching routines online, they're a dime a dozen. Additionally, I've had great success seeing a qualified chiropractor, because they will help reset your skeletal configuration (joints, ligaments etc.) which can suffer a bit of imbalance after a few months of serious training. There's no reason why a muscular body (within reason) can't maintain, and even gain flexibility. 

Background I've noticed that my front squats are seriously lagging behind. I know that most people have a weaker front squat than back squat, but mine is about 50-60% behind in terms of 5-8RM. I suspect that among all the muscle groups that are worked by both variations, there is a subset of muscles that are holding me back. Question Which muscle groups are more central to the front squat than the back squat? What accessory exercises would assist me in developing a stronger front squat? How I do them In terms of stance, I have a semi-wide stance, feet pointing only slightly outward. Akin to riding a horse. I cross my arms over the bar, rather than the backward wrist bend. I find I have no problem keeping the bar on my shoulders as I raise my elbows in front so that they are always parallel to the ground. I place the bar just inside the front delt, so the bar is very close to my neck, and since the front delt is flexed by raising the elbow, the bar has additional support which prevents it from going anywhere. 

This is highlighted in your first image. It tells you which muscles are used to facilitate the movement, and these are the muscles that will develop strength and size IF you achieve progressive overload. 

If you've experienced toothache during lifting, I'm inclined to believe there is an underlying problem. Many lifters to indeed clench their jaw during particularly heavy lifts, and this might be interpreted as toothache. Certain heavy lifts like deadlifts and pullups put strain on muscles in the neck/jaw area, which in some cases could affect muscles and tendons in the tempomandibular area. Even so, it's still far from anything that should cause concern for your teeth during lifts, but it's worth it to "keep an eye" on whether or not you're gritting your teeth together when performing. 

DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) is primarily something you feel when you stretch out the eccentric portion of the exercise. (Source: $URL$ Excerpt: 

There's nothing wrong with your metabolism, and it's not something you train. The difference between someone with a "slow" and a "fast" metabolism is very small. You need to diet properly. If you're gaining weight, or not losing weight, it's simply because you eat too much. Again, you can't train your metabolism to work faster. You have to control your caloric intake. As far as weightless muscle gain goes, this is more likely to be doable if you're a beginner, and becomes harder to accomplish as you build more muscle. I have a hard time taking you seriously when you say 

Grip orientation. You can do prone (knuckles facing you), supine (knuckles facing away), neutral (knuckles facing away from eachother), as well as some others that essentially is a middle ground between neutral and one of the others. You'll know it when you see it. Grip width. Here, you can mix things up by varying how close your hands are to eachother; anything from touching, to shoulder width, outside shoulders, or even the extra wide. Again, you'll see the bar, and know. It often bends down at the end, so the extra wide grip is easier on your wrists.
