In caves, protected from sun and cold. Possibly carved out by a meltwater river during the days. A couple of days, a generation, to learn how to live without moving and time to expand the cave system into something more suited to habitation. Maybe they got lucky and found metals and coal in the cave. It would have to happen many times, rumours that it was possible to survive the day in a cave if you were too injured to outrun the dawn. A story that someone once survived the night in a cave with a hot spring. Tribes in dire need of a safe place forced to take the risk. Some live, some die, one thrives. 

In terms of price, it isn't unjustly inflated. Either it's a price you're willing to pay or it isn't. That's true of any product from any vendor. If you're not willing to pay that price, walk away. Consider the iPhone. It's well known that it retails at around 900% of cost yet people still pay it. Why? They consider it to be a price worth paying for that product. "Unjust" inflation of prices can only apply to products essential to survival, e.g. food, water, etc. 

A trade union is a body that primarily represents a group of employees of an organisation in negotiations with the organisation. It has no place in the middle ages because the only employers of the scale that would allow trade unions are the military, navy and church. It's not until the industrial revolution that unions would be viable. Guilds are effectively governing bodies of an industry and act as a membership body for self-employed persons. Membership of and mastership certified by the guild was the statement of competence of a craftsman. Without membership of the guild related to his industry a man would hard pressed to get work. The closest we have now are the chartered institutes that effectively replaced the guilds when the concept of being apprenticed to a master was lost as the only way into an industry. While both attempt to set pay scales, the union does it by negotiation with the employer and the guild does it by negotiation with the membership and effectively acts as a price cartel in their region. 

What these maps also show if you look at the Southern Ocean is that there's a clear correct direction for sailing round the world giving you a significant concept of sailing the wrong way round the world. Related to the concept of sailing the wrong way, you can also see that on the return trip to Europe from India/China/Spice Islands, you need to sail close to the Cape of Good Hope so as to not have wind and current against you. Meaning that tales of bad trips round the Cape still hold today for those sailing the wrong way. Deadzones The best known deadzone is called the doldrums, officially called the Intertropical Convergence Zone, it's an area with no wind around the equator. It's possible for a sailing ship to get stuck for days or even weeks in glassy seas. 

Shoot the Archduke It's not really about who you kill, it's about who you manage to frame for it. As an example, kill the president of South Korea and blame it on North Korea (or vice versa). There will be a string of equivalent parings across the world, depending on who tensions are high with at the given moment. Of course the whole system was on the verge of war anyway, even Queen Victoria had reputedly mentioned the inevitability of war with her grandson (Kaiser Bill). Away from tensions already building, it's hard to trigger anything much from a single death. Throughout the cold war period the great powers were systematically killing off each other's agents with no great repercussions as it was all par for the course. 

Follow the salmon Salmon have much the same breeding requirements and as a valuable "cash crop" humans have a tendency to build fish ladders and other features to allow them to bypass dams in rivers. They're also highly sensitive to pollution so the rivers they're breeding in will be clean. 

Career Stagnation is the name of the game. If you've ever tried to change processes when your manager has been doing things the same way for 30 years and it's always been fine in the past, imagine what it would be like when it's been done the same way for 130 years. Asking for 5 years industry experience? No, now you can ask for 30 years experience. New tech? No way, if it ain't broken... Young people are going to remain unemployed until their children have grown up. Your kids will be at Uni by the time you've got the steady career that you've only just got into in your late 20s/early 30s, which may even become your late 50s early 60s. What's the rush anyway? You'll be doing it for another 100 years. Family This largely depends on the importance of family in the culture you come from. Marriage might as well be a limited term contract as it is. Some people will partner for life but the majority will done by 20 years or so. Relationships will apply to specific periods in your life, rarely carrying over to the next stage. Early ones for fun, then a steady one for reproduction, moving into a career growth relationship, before a steady one again when you settle into a specific role, finally a retirement relationship for travelling and some old age fun. 

Here are a couple of the key aspects: Extermination of the mega-fauna. This is still uncertain but it's considered likely that human hunters destabilised the populations and effectively exterminated a lot of these animals. Deforestation. This is a bigger issue than previously mentioned. Not just Central Europe and the Near East but from Britain, which was solid forest, all the way across Russia. With just these two differences the world would be a place unrecognisable to us. but let's consider the way the things we affect, affect the world in their turn. Elephants knock over trees, fewer elephants, more trees. Wild herbivores eat young shoots, also keeping down new trees, fewer predators, fewer trees, more erosion. Beavers build dams, meaning more shallow lakes, lower speed flow on the rivers, less erosion, but we killed all the beavers and cut down the trees that would bind the banks, so even the rivers don't follow the courses they would without us. A few other things we've done. Draining the wetlands, this was even done by the Romans. Extermination of predators, the Iberian Lynx is almost gone, the Eurasian Lion has been gone a long time. The Sabertooth Cat? Not known if this was humans. Marsupial Lion, believed to be humans.
