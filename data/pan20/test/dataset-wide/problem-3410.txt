I don't think it's common for there to be "free" shipping though. I'm retracting the part about China subsidizing exporters. 

In labor, you might see a very basic profit maximization setup where the worker maximizes $$\max_{e} \ U = \mathbb{E}(\alpha + \beta (e + v) - C(e))$$ where $e$ is some level of effort, $\alpha + \beta q$ is pay given $q$ output and $q = e + v$, where $v$ is an i.i.d. random variable with an expected value of zero in this case. The first order condition is $$\frac{\partial}{\partial e} : \beta - c'(e) = 0$$ which will create the labor supply function. The constraint is that the worker is individually rational, so $\alpha + \beta e \geq C(e)$, which can be simplified to just equality since the firm will maximize profit by giving just enough pay to elicit the effort they are looking for. So the firm maximizes $$\max_{\alpha, \beta} \ E(q) - (\alpha + \beta e) = e - C(e)$$ FOC: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} : [1 - c'(e)] \frac{\partial e}{\partial \beta} = 0$$ $$\implies \beta = 1 \ (= c'(e))$$ 

Given your equations, you can find $$Y = C + 50 + 20 \implies Y = C + 70$$ You can then substitute $Y$ for its equal into your other equation $$C = 100 + 0.5(C + 70 - T)$$ Finally, given a balanced buget, you know that $G = T$, which should be enough for you to solve for $C$. 

which is just a description of a set's minimum value. What does the (familiar) set here look like?... 

There's a steady state level of capital and prices of capital, and similarly a steady state for the labor supply. Banks at some point don't lend more out, or whatever lending they do, firms use to invest in capital to replace depreciation. I'd probably also hazard a guess that some investment is just repaying loans, so money velocity can't just grow forever. Those are the first things that come to my mind, but I'm sure there's a more direct answer to this. 

One of the biggest areas of policy research that seems to have gotten a lot of attention since the Great Recession is macroprudential policy. My understanding of it is that it tries to move beyond microfoundations of understanding individual risk and looks at system wide risk across institutions. The article I link gives a lot of good resources on recent research done on it in the last 10 years, and some limited comments on the effectiveness of new policies formed out of it. 

Hint: To ensure the existence of utility function representation, we must have continuous preferences (and this is a sufficient condition). From the Mas-Colell book: The preference relation $\succeq$ on $X$ is continuous if it is preserved under limits. That is, for any sequence of pairs ${(x^n, y^n)}^\infty_{n=1}$ with $x^n \succeq y^n$ for all $n$, $x = \lim_{n \to \infty} x^n$ and $y = \lim_{n \to \infty} y^n$, we have $x \succeq y$. We then look at the definition of utility function representation. The function $U$ represents $\succeq$ on $X$ if $\forall \ x,y \in X, x \succeq y \iff u(x) \geq u(y)$, where $u: X \to \mathbb{R}$. Though it may be easier just to show that the preferences themselves are not continuous, and thus there is no utility function representation, continuous or not. 

The idea is that both the consumer and the producer of a good take on some of the burden of a tax, even if you don't intend to levy the tax on one or the other. So if you have a sales tax that consumers have to pay, what will happen is that consumers won't take the full brunt of that tax. They will demand less and producers will have to make the product cheaper in response, so they get less revenue overall anyway. How much tax burden each side will have to pay depends on their relative elasticities, which I imagine you'll be going over soon if you're going over tax incidence. Elasticity is a measure of sensitivity to a change in price to in this case, quantity supplies or demanded. So $P* \neq P_p$ because the producer will have to shift from the equilibrium just like the producer will have to. It's the same idea for the consumer as for the producer, since the tax burden falls on both of them. 

A short note: please try to show your math work in the original post, and maybe learn some basic Math TeX commands. It makes people much more willing to help with homework questions. So first, we have our unemployment for the year 2000. Let $U_t, u_t, L_t$ denote the unemployment rate, number of unemployed, and number of laborers at time $t$, respectively. $$U_t = \frac {u_t}{u_t + L_t}$$ $$U_{2000} = \frac {2,000,000}{2,000,000 + 16,000,000} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.111$$ So in the year 2001, 800,000 people turn 16, but half do not enter the labor force. So the question is how many people have to find a job for unemployment to fall below 8%. $$U_{2001} = \frac{2,000,000 + (400,000 - n)}{2,000,000 + (400,000 - n) + 16,000,000 + n} = 0.08$$ where $n$ is the number of those who found jobs, and $400,000 - n$ is the net change in unemployment numbers. Solve for $n$. $$\frac{2,400,000 - n}{18,400,000} = 0.08$$ $$\implies 1,472,000 = 2,400,000 - n \implies 928,000 = n$$ So what does this tell us? Even if all 400,000 new 16 year olds found jobs, that would not drive unemployment down to 8%. You need quite a few more people to find jobs. 

We have: $$Z(\vec p) = \bigg(Z_1(p_1, p_2), Z_2(p_1, p_2) \bigg)$$ and can substitute $p_1 = 1 - p_2$ as Herr K. has pointed out. $$Z(\vec p) = \bigg(Z_1(p_1, 1 - p_1), Z_2(p_1, 1-p_1) \bigg)$$ $Z_1$ can be expressed as a function of one variable, $Z_1(p_1)$, so that the Intermediate Value Theorem can be applied. On the interval $I = (0, 1) \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $Z_1: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a continuous (and bounded) function where given $$\infty > Z_1(p_1 = 0) > 0 > Z_1(p_1 = 1) > -\infty$$ there exists $p_1^* \in (0, 1)$ such that $Z_1(p_1^*) = 0$ And by Walras' Law, $$p_1^* Z_1(p_1^*, 1-p_1^*) + (1 - p_1^*) Z_2(p_1^*, 1-p_1^*) = 0$$ $$p_1^* \cdot 0 + (1 - p_1^*) Z_2(p_1^*, 1-p_1^*) = 0$$ and because $(1-p_1^*) > 0$ $$Z_2(p_1^*, 1-p_1^*) = 0$$ meaning $Z(p_1^*) := Z(p^*_1, p^*_2) = (0, 0)$ 

However, no free lunch axiom needs more than merely "passing through the origin." The first image shows a production set (two dimensions) that satisfies no free lunch. The second image shows a production set that does not, even though it passes through the origin. (yes this image is a bad rendition of the one from Mas-Colell) 

We have: $$y_t = c_t − w^u(1 − N_t) + \kappa v_t$$ We take the log of both sides: $$\ln y_t = \ln \left[ c_t − w^u(1 − N_t) + \kappa v_t \right]$$ And then linearize around the steady states: $$\begin{align} \ln \bar{y} + \frac{1}{\bar{y}}(y_t - \bar{y}) & = \ln \left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right] + \frac{1}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(c_t - \bar{c}) \\ & + \frac{w_u}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(N_t - \bar{N}) \\ & + \frac{\kappa}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(V_t - \bar{V}) \end{align} $$ Cancel $\ln \bar{y}$ and $\ln \left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]$ $$\begin{align} \frac{1}{\bar{y}}(y_t - \bar{y}) & = \frac{1}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(c_t - \bar{c}) \\ & + \frac{w_u}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(N_t - \bar{N}) \\ & + \frac{\kappa}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}(V_t - \bar{V}) \end{align} $$ Multiply the first term on the right hand side by $\frac{\bar{c}}{\bar{c}}$, and similarly for the other terms: $$\begin{align} \frac{1}{\bar{y}}(y_t - \bar{y}) & = \frac{\bar{c}}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}\frac{(c_t - \bar{c})}{\bar{c}} \\ & + \frac{w_u \bar{N}}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}\frac{(N_t - \bar{N})}{\bar{N}} \\ & + \frac{\kappa \bar{V}}{\left[ \bar{c} - w^u(1-\bar{N}) + \kappa \bar{V} \right]}\frac{(V_t - \bar{V})}{\bar{V}} \end{align} $$ And we simplify, taking advantage of the fact that $\hat{v}_t = \hat{\theta}_t + \hat{u}_t$, to get what you have: $$\hat{y}_t = \frac{\bar{C}}{\bar{Y}}\hat{c}_t + w^u \frac{\bar{N}}{\bar{Y}} \hat{n}_t + \left( \frac{K\bar{V}}{\bar{Y}} \right) (\hat{\theta}_t + \hat{u}_t) $$ I don't think this derivation is wrong. But you can see that $y_t$ and $N_t$ are directly proportional to each other. It's definitely plausible that $\frac{\bar{N}}{\bar{Y}} = 1$, but I've pored over the equations in the setup for 3 hours to no avail at showing that rigorously. It's probably something silly that I don't understand. I'll look back later and if nothing else, I'll turn this answer into a community wiki so anyone who has the right idea can edit it. 

Take an individual's maximization problem: $$\max_{x_i} = U(x_1,...,x_n) \quad \text{s.t.} \ \vec{p} \cdot \vec{x} = w$$ Where one of the goods $j$ is a riskless savings good (savings account, government bond, mattress, whatever). You can then use the Slutsky decomposition to measure how a change in income will change the consumption of good $j$, which you can then adjust to be relative to income, $w$. More relevant (though harder) would to set up the problem as a dynamic programming problem, where the consumer wishes to consumption smooth over their lifetime. 

I don't know how you got 48% (and it would have been appropriate to include your work in your question), but think about it intuitively. Take your second to last step. If the landowner lends to the villagers and on average gets 60 dollars plus interest back, then if the interest rate was 80%, you'd get 60 + 48 = 108 dollars, the same as depositing to the commercial bank. Algebraically, here's how you'd set up solving for $r$: $$(100 \cdot (1+r))0.6 + 0(0.4) = 108$$ Where you have a 60% chance of being paid back 100 with interest. Then you just solve. 

Take the car example from in the comments. That is, say you "promise both your friends a car, but you only have one car and both friends know this". Well, the analogy is a little stilted, not quite parallel to what a bank is like. If you were a bank, you would only lend (not give away forever) out the car if you were promised to get it back with some interest, (maybe more gas or something). Problems only happen if both friends want the car the same time. 

A firm maximizing expected profit will actually prefer the first scenario to the second. Say $\pi(\cdot)$ is the profit function and $F(\cdot)$ is the distribution function for the prices. Since $\pi(\cdot)$ is convex in price, by Jensen's inequality: $$\int \pi(p) \ \text{d}F(p) \geq \pi\left(\int p \ \text{d}F(p)\right)$$ But the left hand side is expected profit from uncertain prices, and the right hand side is the profit under expected prices. So you can reflect on whether this is how firms really behave. If a firm was faced with the possibility of selling their portfolio for 1 billion dollars, or losing 1 billion dollars, based on a coin flip, would they go through with this bet? Or would they sell off the portfolio for 0 dollars? 

The reason you probably find it hard to think of a case where this happens is because rarely do countries go around trying to make poor trades (read: never). If you trade real goods, there will almost always be a comparative advantage of trade to be had as long as countries have different production possibility frontiers in different ratios. Different opportunity costs of making more of one good means you might want another countries' labor to offer that service. I can't give any specific examples of trades that were bad for each party where each party also was trying to act in there own self interest. Maybe if two countries were trading public debt with each other before a recession, they might end up with riskier assets than they bargained for, so even though the expected value of the debt was worth enough before a negative growth shock, you might get something less favorable in practice. Even then I don't think a situation like that is very likely to happen. 

Consider Cagan's Model. Future inflation is not just based on money supply changes now, but expected money supply changes in the future. One of the major reasons inflation hasn't skyrocketed out of control despite the large amounts of quantitative easing going on is because people know the Federal Reserve is targeting a low rate of inflation. As for interest rates, the Fed keeps their interest rate low to encourage banks to lend out more money. They can't offer a negative nominal interest rate for obvious reasons though, so you run into the zero interest floor problem, where it is hard to encourage institutions to borrow money and stimulate the economy, thus getting perpetually low inflation. No matter how much you try to stimulate the economy, as EnergyNumber's answer states, you can't push on a string; there's only so much conventional monetary policy can do. 

That's just skimming the surface of this issue probably, so hopefully others will be elaborate better than me. 

In theory. But in real life, people's bids are interdependent. You can imagine a bunch of big-wig types in a room for an auction of a priceless piece of art, where part of the value of the object is winning it and beating out the competition because you're the coolest kid on the block (with lots of cash to throw around). In this case, you can imagine a first price auction would be better suited for the house than a second price sealed auction. 

It really depends on what model you use. Classical and Keynesian economists believe that real wage is counter-cyclical. In Lucas' New Classical model, he believes real wage is acylical. In the Real Business Cycle model, economists say that real wage is procyclical after WW2, in America. The general consensus now is that 

(Don't vote on this; this is just my comment which is too long) The Riemann-Zeta function, which is a general case for the Ramanujan sum, has many un-intuitive and baffling properties such as: 

Your major concern still is in finding the distribution which bidders lie on. I think you are right that you will end up having to guess what the distribution looks like. You also talk about whether the distribution will change based on how many people see the project. My suspicion is that the distribution will be more heavily towards the low end of willingness to pay with fewer viewers, and as more people see the project (and its bidders), the more people will be willing to put in larger bids for the project, so the distribution will slowly "grow a tail" towards the higher end. 

We want to show that for $\succcurlyeq$ on $X$, Def 1 $\iff$ Def 2 $\boxed \Longrightarrow$ Assume that $\succcurlyeq$ is continuous by Def 1. Let us say $x \succ y$. Denote our open-balls as $B(x, r)$, an open ball around $x$ of radius $r$. Suppose $\forall n, \ \exists \ x^n \in B(x, \frac{1}{n}), \ y^n \in B(y, \frac{1}{n})$ such that $y^n \succcurlyeq x^n$. But then we have constructed $\{x^n\} \rightarrow x$ and $\{y^n\} \rightarrow y$, and by Def 1, $y \succcurlyeq x$, which is a contradiction. $\boxed \Longleftarrow$ Assume that $\succcurlyeq$ is continuous by Def 2. Let us take sequences ${x^n} \subset X$ and ${y^n} \subset X$ where $\forall n, \quad x^n \succcurlyeq y^n$ and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x^n = x, \quad \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} y^n = y \quad (\text{where $x, y \in X)$}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, BUT $x \succcurlyeq y$ is false instead of true. We want to show this leads to a contradiction. If $x \succcurlyeq y$ is false, (so $y \succ x$) then $\exists B_x, B_y$ such that $\forall y' \in B_y, x' \in B_x$, we have $y' \succ x'$. Because $\{x^n\} \rightarrow x, \{y^n\} \rightarrow y$, there exists $N$ large enough such that $\forall n>N$, we have $y^n \in B_y, x^n \in B_x$. Thus $\forall n > N$, we have $y^n \succ x^n$, which contradicts $\forall n, \ x^n \succcurlyeq y^n$.
