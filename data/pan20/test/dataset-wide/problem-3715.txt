I found this thesis: Groupoid Crossed Products by Geoff Goehle, $URL$ It also uses this notion and includes the definition. (Since it is from a closely related area, it is a reasonable guess that this notion is used in the same way.) If $I$ is a directed set then a generalized limit $\omega$ on $\ell^\infty(I)$ is defined here as: 

Wikipedia article on Luzin mentions several English resources in the section on Luzin affair. (Here is a link to the recent revision of the article, just in case there will be some substantial changes.) References in English language which are mentioned there, are: 

This is probably not as impressive as other answers, but since I am quite fond of real induction, I could not resist. Real induction can be stated as follows: 

The proofs of the facts mentioned above and some related references can be also found online. Ultrafilters are not measurable: 

Notice that for real $x$ we have $\inf_{i\in I} x_i \le \omega(x) \le \sup_{i\in I} x_i$, and thus $x\ge0 \Rightarrow \omega(x)\ge0$, i.e., such functional will necessary be positive. It is also clear that any convex combination of generalized limits is again a generalized limit. One natural way to obtain such generalized limit is to use Hahn-Banach theorem and extend the limit from the space of convergent nets on $I$ to $\ell_\infty(I)$. This would be rather straightforward in the case $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$. If $\mathbb K=\mathbb C$ then we take a real generalized limit $\omega_1$ and we define $\omega=\omega_1+i\omega_1$. Some additional work is needed to show that $\|L\|\le 1$. Details can be found in the references above. As mentioned in Yemon Choi's answer, another possible approach is take any ultrafilter $\mathcal U$ containing the tail filter of the directed set $I$, i.e., the filter consisting of all sets of the form $[i_0,\infty)=\{i\in I; i\ge i_0\}$ for $i_0\in I$. If we have such ultrafilter, then the $\mathcal U$-limit extends the usual limit of the net. (As far as I can say, this seems again rather straightforward in the real case. In the complex case, we can use the same approach as before to show that the norm of $\mathcal U$-limit is equal to $1$.) However, not every generalized limit can be realized in this way. (In the case $I=\mathbb N$ example of a generalized limit which is not an ultralimit is a Banach limit, which was already mentioned above.) 

I should point out that Gerhard Paseman suggested in a comment another solution using transfinite induction. And for $n=2$ he suggested in another comment a solution which does not use transfinite induction. 

This formulation is taken from this Pete L. Clark's answer where also his text on this topic is linked.1 If we look at the set $S'=\{x\in[a,b]; [a,x]\subseteq S\}$, then the above conditions simply say that $S'$ is non-empty clopen subset of $[a,b]$. So in this way, we can view this as a consequence of connectedness. The linked paper contains several theorems shown using real induction. Usually the proof goes by choosing a suitable set $S$ and showing that this set fulfills the conditions (RI1), (RI2), (RI3). At least for some of them it seems that there is not much difference between difficulty of the proof that $S$ is a non-empty clopen subset and the proof that $S$ fulfills these conditions. (Of course, it is more elegant to use real induction if we want to illustrate this method as unifying principle for proofs of several basic theorems. And also in this way similarity to the usual mathematical induction is highlighted. But for the purposes of this question, this approach might be a way how to view proofs by real induction as a source of applications of connectedness in analysis.) 

As already mentioned in the comments, a free ultrafilter considered as a subset of Cantor space (or Cantor set) cannot be analytic, so the answer to the Question 1 is No. (Even without the assumption that the given ideal is P-ideal; we get that no maximal ideal can be analytic.) This follows immediately if we show that ultrafilter is not Lebesgue measurable or if we show that it does not have the Baire property. (Since both properties are true for any analytic set.) Question 2 basically asks whether the restriction to the subset $X$ is a maximal ideal (an ultrafilter). Notice that $X\notin\mathcal I$ implies that $X$ is infinite, so this is rather similar to the original situation. Moreover, since $A\mapsto A\cap X$ is a continuous map $2^\omega\to 2^X$, the restriction will be analytic if the original ideal (filter) was. So the answer to Question 2 is No as well. This was pointed out in Jing Zhang's comment. 

From Corollary 2 it follows that $d(P^{m_0})=0$ for each $m_0$. (In the other words, Corollary 2 implies that the set of all numbers having at most $m_0$ prime factors has density zero. Niven also mentions in connection with this weaker result the paper Willy Feller, Erhard Tornier: Mengentheoretische Untersuchung von Eigenschaften der Zahlenreihe, Mathematische Annalen 1933, Volume 107, Issue 1, pp 188-232.) 

Another source where this notion is defined is the book Dana P. Williams: Crossed Products of $C^*$-Algebras, AMS, 2007. Some parts of the book are freely available here. (This includes the part I quoted below.) 

If we have a set $\mathcal L$ of lines in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $|\mathcal L|=\mathfrak c$, we can get the set $M$ with the desired properties using transfinite induction. 

Based on Yemon Choi's suggestion I am posting here an answer. So far it is mostly a summary of stuff which is was said in a post on another site and in the comments above. But if you have something to add (and it is not enough for a separate answer), feel free to edit this. (After all, this is community wiki.) A quick Google search leads to the paper A. Amini-Harand: Metric-like spaces, partial metric spaces and fixed points, doi.org/10.1186/1687-1812-2012-204. This paper contains a definition of metric-like space in the same way as given in the question and contains a claim that the open balls, defined as above, indeed give a topology (without a proof). Counterexamples 

After this, the paper continuous with discussion of relation of ultrafilters to non-determined games. The references mentioned above are: 

If $|\mathcal L|<\mathfrak c$ then we can simply choose one point from each set $l \setminus \bigcup\limits_{\substack{k\ne l\\ k\in \mathcal L}} k$. This set is non-empty - it has cardinality $\mathfrak c$. 

The paper G.G. Lorentz: A contribution to the theory of divergent sequences; Acta mathematica, Volume 80, Number 1, 1960, 167-190; DOI: 10.1007/BF02393648, contains several interesting results related to your questions on Banach limits. A characterization of matrix methods that sum all almost convergent sequences is given (Theorem 7). In particular, each $C_\alpha$ sums all almost convergent sequences. However, it is shown that almost convergence cannot be represented by a regular matrix method. Also the following stronger result about a class of matrix methods is shown. Theorem 11. For every sequence $\{A_k\}$ of methods of the class $\mathfrak A$ there is a bounded sequence $x = \{x_n\}$ which is not almost convergent but is summable to the value zero by every one of the methods $A_k$. The class $\mathfrak A$ in Lorentz's paper is the class of matrices fulfilling $$\lim\limits_{m\to\infty} \max\limits_n |a_{mn}|=0.$$ I think it's not that hard to show that each matrix $C_n$ belongs to $\mathfrak A$. Some further references for almost convergence are mentioned e.g in the book Boos: Classical and Modern Methods in Summability. 

A proof can also be found in Asaf Karagila: Zornian Functional Analysis or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Axiom of Choice, $URL$ and $URL$ 

Since uniformly rotund implies weakly uniformly rotund, the part (b) of this exercise answers at least the question about relation of (UR) and (URED). We get that (UR)$\Rightarrow$(URED). Smith's example should be a counterexample for the opposite implication. ((URWC) is defined in the previous exercise, and it fulfills (wUR)$\Rightarrow$(URWC)$\Rightarrow$(R). References mentioned in this excerpt: 

I think that the answer is No. The space $\mathcal B(\mathcal P(\mathbf N), \mathbf R)$ with pointwise convergence is a locally convex space. (It can be considered a subspace of $\mathbf R^{\mathcal P(\mathbf N)}$.) The set $\mathscr U$ is compact in this space. (It can be identified with a closed subset of $[0,1]^{\mathcal P(\mathbf N)}$.) So by Krein-Milman theorem we get that $\mathscr U$ is closed convex hull of the set of all extreme points of $\mathscr U$. On the other hand, the set of all weakly additive upper densities is closed and convex subset of $\mathcal B(\mathcal P(\mathbf N), \mathbf R)$. (It suffices to check that limit of a convergent net of weakly additive upper densities is again a weakly additive upper density and that a convex combination of weakly upper densities is a weakly upper density.) So if all extreme points of $\mathscr U$ were weakly additive, the same would be true for the whole set $\mathscr U$. 

I will copy here an exercise from Megginson's book An Introduction to Banach Space Theory, since I think it answers at least partially your question. For definitions on some notions (and also for some other facts related to this notion) you might want to have a look in this book and the references given there.
