Empirical evidence: Using C++ and a fast routine to exponentiate maps as well as some elementary observations, I proved both conjectures for all $j \le 26$ and all even integers $n.$ Using the equivalent form $(*),$ I proved the conjecture for the cases $n=2$ and $j \le 46.$ 

We first introduce several functions motivated by Kolakoski's sequence. The conjecture itself can be stated independently of Kolakoski's sequence. You can skip straight to the formulation of the conjecture below the line. Kolakoski's sequence is the unique sequence of 1's and 2's which describes its own sequence of block lengths and whose first term is 1. The first few terms are 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1.... Notation: we'll write sequences as strings. We use a sequence of length 1 and a single term interchangeably. The concatenation of sequences $s$ and $t$ is $st.$ Let $m, n$ be different positive integers. $\{m, n\}^\omega$ is the set of finite nonempty sequences whose terms are all $m$ or $n.$ We define $E_{m, n}: \{m, n\}^\omega \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$ recursively as follows. If $t$ has length $1$, then $E_{m, n}(s, t)$ is the unique finite sequence whose terms are all $m$ or $n$, whose first term is the term in $t$, and whose sequence of block lengths is $s.$ For example, $E_{2, 3}(233, 2)=22333222.$ If $t$ has length greater than $1,$ then suppose that $t=yu,$ where $y$ is a single term (the first term), $u$ is the rest of the sequence, and $yu$ is the concatenation. Then $E_{m, n}(s, yu) = E_{m, n}(E_{m, n}(s, y), u).$ One can show that for finite sequences $s_1, s_2, t_1,$ there exists a unique sequence $t_2$ of the same length as $t_1$ (all in $\{m, n\}^\omega$) such that $E_{m, n}(s_1s_2, t_1) = E_{m, n}(s_1, t_1)E_{m, n}(s_2, t_2).$ Furthermore, $t_2$ depends only on $s_1, t_1.$ We define the function $C_{m, n}$ such that $C_{m, n}(s_1, t_1) = t_2.$ 

If $E$ is not CM, then the action of complex conjugation on $E$ depends on how it is embedded into $\mathbb{C}$. In particular, it could have different real subfields depending on which embedding you are using. When $E$ is CM, so that it is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of the totally real subfield $F$, then it has a unique complex conjugation that commutes with all automorphisms of $E$, such that $F$ contains precisely the elements that are fixed by complex conjugation in all embeddings. This lets you talk about unitarity and hermiticity for the abstract field $E$, and not just for some particular embedding. Or, to put it another way, there can be more than one way to consistently define a complex conjugation on your field, unless it is CM, in which case there is a unique way to define it. 

What roots of unity can be contained in the abelian extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$? In particular, I would like to know: 

I believe the double cover you are looking for is just $\tilde{U}(n) = \tilde{U}(1) \times SU(n)$, where $$\tilde{U}(1) = \lbrace\exp(\phi T) : 0 \leq \phi < 4\pi\rbrace$$ is the double cover of $U(1)$ and $T$ is a formal generator of its Lie algebra. This cover factors through the usual cover $U(1)\times SU(n) \to U(n)$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto (e^{i\phi/2},U) \mapsto e^{i\phi/2} U.$$ So the problem reduces to classifying the $\tilde{U}(1)$ representations and the $SU(n)$ ones, and the answer is straightforward. First decompose $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq \bigoplus_{N=0}^\infty V_N,$$ where $V_N$ is the eigenspace of $H$ with eigenvalue $2N+1$. Then $\tilde{U}(1)\times SU(n)$ should act irreducibly on each $V_N$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto e^{iN\phi/2} \cdot \mathrm{Sym}^N U.$$ It is easy to see this. The $\tilde{U}(1)$ action is the same as with the usual $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ case. You can easily derive the $SU(n)$ representations using the Fock space isomorphism of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with a Hilbert space of analytic functions: $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq L^2_\mathrm{hol}\(\mathbb{C}^n,\pi^{-n}e^{-||z||^2/2}dz).$$ Under this isomorphism, $V_N$ maps to the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $N$, and $SU(n)$ acts on polynomials in the usual way as $(Uf)(z) = f(Uz)$. This is probably all contained in Bargmann's classic paper. 

I am reading A. Yekutieli's original article on dualizing complexes for noncommutative algebras and I found a problem I cannot solve. First, some background. We start with a field $k$ and a noetherian $\mathbb N$-graded algebra $A$ and assume that $A_0 = k$. All objects are graded, and we write $\mathcal A$ for the category of graded $A$-bimodules. A dualizing complex is an object $R^\bullet$ in the derived category $\mathcal D(\mathcal A)$ satisfying the following: 

Both are instances of a more general version of Baer's criterion for Grothendieck categories with a family of generators [which I've seen mentioned yet never found a proof], but I haven't been able to adapt this to the general context. 

Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $A$ an $H$-comodule algebra; denote by $M^H_A$ the category of right $(H,A)$-Hopf modules [i.e. $A$-module, $H$-comodules, everything is compatible with everything else]. I would like to know if there is an analogue of Baer's criterion for the category $M^H_A$; in other words, 

I have a field $L$ and two field automorphisms $f, g: L \to L$ such that $f \circ g = g \circ f$. Under what conditions can they be extended to automorphisms of an extension $K \mid L$ that still commute? In particular they can certainly be extended to automorphisms of the algebraic clousure $K = \overline L$, but can they be extended to a pair of commuting automorphisms? 

Short version: if $G$ is a Coxeter group and $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup, both acting on a space $V$, is it true that the invariant-coinvariant algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a natural bilinear form induced by taking coefficients in the top component? Now the long, detailed version. Let $G$ be a Coxeter group acting on a real vector space $V$ with a fixed generating set of reflections $S$. We can form the symmetric algebra $S(V)$, the invariant subalgebra $S(V)^G \subset S(V)$, and the ideal $I_G \subset S(V)$ generated by elements of $S(V)^G$ of positive degree. The coinvariant algebra is defined as $S(V)_G = S(V)/I_G$. By the Cehvalley-Shephard-Todd theorem it is isomorphic to the regular representation of $G$ as a $G$-module. If $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup then the $H$-invariants $(S(V)_G)^H$ form a subalgebra of $S(V)_G$, which is finite dimensional and whose top nonzero component is $1$-dimensional over $\mathbb R$, say spanned by $s$. Then $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a nice bilinear pairing given by taking $(f,g)$ to be the coefficient of $s$ in the product $fg$ for all $f, g \in (S(V)_G)^H$. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a generalized flag variety by a famous theorem of Borel. Plus the bilinear form described above is the pullback of the PoincarÃ© pairing in said cohomology, and in particular it is nondegenerate. Questions: 

Another way to define $C_{m, n}: \{m, n\} \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$, where $m, n$ are positive integers. We've restricted the first argument to $\{m, n\}$ because that's all that's necessary for the conjecture. Aside: in general, it makes sense for the first argument to be a finite sequence. See the above paragraph. One can show that $C_{m, n}(s_1 s_2, t_1) = C_{m, n}(s_2,C_{m, n}(s_1, t_1)).$ For $x, t$ in $\{m, n\},$ we define $C_{m, n}(x, t)$ to be $\bar{t},$ where $\bar{t}$ is the value in $\{m, n\}$ not equal to $t.$ For $x, y$ in $\{m, n\}$ and $u$ in $\{m, n\}^\omega,$ we define $f(s):=C_{m, n}(y, s)$ and $C_{m, n}(x, yu):=\bar{y}f^x(u),$ where the superscript denotes iteration. For example, $C_{1, 2}(1, 222) = 1 C_{1, 2}(2, 22) = 11\left(C_{1, 2}(2, C_{1, 2}(2, 2)) \right) = 112.$ Some more examples: $C_{1, 2}(1, -)$ sends $111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222$ to $222, 221, 212, 211, 121, 122, 111, 112$ respectively, and $C_{1, 2}(2, -)$ sends $111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222$ to $211, 212, 221, 222, 111, 112, 121, 122$ respectively. Observe that $C_{m, n}(x, -),$ where $x$ is fixed, is bijective on $\{m, n\}^\omega,$ and it fixes lengths. Here is the conjecture: Conjecture. Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ even. Let $1^j$ be the sequence of $j$ terms which are all $1.$ Then the size of the orbit of $1^j$ under the function $C_{m, n}(1, -)$ equals $2^{\lfloor(j+1)/2\rfloor}.$ One can show that the following conjecture is equivalent: Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ with $j$ even. Then the sequence $E_{1, n}(1^{2^j}, 1^{2j})$ has odd length. $(*)$ We can also define $C_{m, n}: \{m, n\} \times \{m, n\}^\omega \rightarrow \{m, n\}^\omega$ where $m, n$ are any integers. Well, we define it exactly as above. A negative power means involves taking the inverse of the function. To do this, we need the functions $C_{m, n}(x, -)$ to be bijective and length preserving. These properties are easy to show. Here is another conjecture. Conjecture. Let $n, j$ be positive integers with $n$ even. Let $s_1, s_2$ be the two sequences of length $j$ which terms alternate between $-1$ and $n.$ Then the size of the orbits of $s_1$ and $s_2$ under the function $C_{-1, n}(-1,-)$ both equal $2^{\lfloor (j+1)/2 \rfloor}.$ 

If you are interested in developing quantum algorithms, there is a nice up-to-date survey by Childs and van Dam called Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems, available at $URL$ For PDE's, you might look into hyperbolic polynomials and hyperbolicity cones. The latter are characterized algebraically, there are lots of open questions about them, and their study is also practially relevant to engineering applications like convex optimization (in case practical applications, or perhaps hot funding areas, are what you're looking for). 

Is $K(\zeta_n)/K$ an abelian extension for every $n$? What are the roots of unity in the ray class field of $K$ with conductor $\mathfrak{c}$? What are the roots of unity in the ring class field of the order $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z} + f\mathcal{O}_K$ with conductor $f$? 

It sounds to me that you need to detect the tempo of the music, and not the pitch. If you are trying to use a pitch-detection algorithms, then these are going to fluctuate rapidly, as they will lock onto the high frequences in your music. It sounds like you need something that filters out all but the lowest frequencies and allows you to determine how many BPM (beat per minute) the music is, as well as the phase of the beat also, so that you can do beatmatching as you originally mention. However, I don't think that anyone here is going to be able to give you a simple formula for doing this directly from the samples. Digital signal processing is, by its very nature, a fairly mathematical subject. I do think that if you try Googling for "beat-matching signal-processing", or "beat-matching matlab", you will be pointed in the right direction, as you might find a published algorithm for doing exactly what you need. For instance, I found the following paper by searching: Design of an Automatic Beat-Matching Algorithm for Portable Media Devices. It might be worth looking at if you can get it without paying, say through a university with a subscription. Otherwise, I'm sure there are 100's of similar papers you can find on this subject. Also, many universities teach an audio signal processing class, and often the notes from these classes are online. Beat-matching is a common project for students to try in such classes and I'm sure you will be able to find some examples where people have done it. Sorry I couldn't give you more explicit advice, but I hope I understood your question correctly and have pointed you in the right direction. Good luck.
