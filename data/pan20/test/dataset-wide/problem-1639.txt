Yes, an increase in wealth can cause unhappiness when there is greater disparity between the rich and the poor. The website Natural News offers this quote in an article about inequality and health: 

Finally, an article titled "Osteomyelitis Associated With Cat-Scratch Disease" from PediatricsConsultantLive.com concludes with this helpful tip: 

Edit (per Matthew Read's comment, here are some links): The Wikipedia entry for Influenza describes the method of transmission for that disease. It confirms that a person with influenza is contagious before they are symptomatic. The Wikipedia entry for Transmission (medicine) lists multiple routes of transmission for a variety of maladies, from HIV to athlete's foot. 

A peer-reviewed paper by Andrey Korotayev and Sergey Tsirel (PDF) (permalink) claims that spectral analysis of the available data supports Kondratiev's hypothesis. In addition to Kondratiev's original three cycles (1790-1844, 1844-1890, 1890-?) Korotoyev and Tsiral complete the date for the end of the third cycle and add two more cycles (1890-1939, 1939-1984, 1984-?), providing about 4 1/2 complete cycles for analysis. Korotoyev and Tsiral also found other shorter-term cycles within the data; Juglar cycles with a period of 7-9 years and Kitchin cycles with a period of 3-4 years. Their analysis also indicates that the Kuznet cycles, with a period of about 17 years, should be considered a third-wave harmonic of the Kondratiev wave (K-wave) and not as a separate, independent cycle. The paper admits that before 1870 there was no detectable K-wave in the global economy, but that K-waves are discernable in "Western" economics. [My own hypothesis of this is that global capitalism and logistics was not mature enough to allow K-waves to exist at that level. Additionally, independent economies could theoretically experience cycles that were out-of-phase with each other, thereby reducing or negating the global scale K-wave cycle.] While an analysis like this does not prove conclusively that Kondratiev was exactly correct, it does provide strong statistical support that the phenomenon exists. This analysis also cannot predict if the lengths of the various cycles will remain relatively constant or if some unforeseen events could cause them to change significantly. 

The Car Connection points out that the book authors have used a yearly travel distance that is around half the U.S national average: 

This chart suggests that the percentage of the No Religion group in the younger population is greater than in the overall population. As they get older, you would expect the overall population to more closely match what we see in the younger population now. This is the chart from 2006 but the chart from the 2013 census shows a similar pattern. 

A comment on the post mentions that three other authors of the study also work for L-Nutra. The study doesn't have any comparison to smoking but the press release from the lead author of the study does. 

Which suggests that some trainee doctors earn more than the basic salary. If we consider this foundation programme to be training rather than a starting salary for a fully qualified doctor then it should be compared to the £20k - £30k training wage for a train driver. It is still possible that some trainee doctors may earn less than some train driver trainees in the first year of training but most doctors will be earning more by the second year, even if they do no overtime or unusual hours. It's worth noting that for the London Underground drivers, some shifts will start before 6am and some will end after 12pm. This BBC article says "as early as 04:45 and end as late as 01:30". No mention is made in the chart of the higher salaries that doctors can earn. 

Not quoted, but presented in the paper, is a discussion on the physical differences in male and female brains. Language ability in male brains appears to be restricted mostly to the left hemisphere but is more developed in the right hemisphere in female brains. The author seems to imply that this allows males to use more of the right hemisphere for the visual-spatial skills that are required for hunting. Bottom-line: Yes, men tend to have better visual-spatial skills than women. 

(Image comes from $URL$ and may have nothing to do with the 'real' moon illusion.) Donald E. Simanek has a very good article about the phenomenon on his website. The opinion presented in his article is that the true nature of the illusion is not completely understood. He presents a number of theories, debunking those that are wrong, and offering suggestions about the more plausible ones. For the time being, the whole true reason behind the phenomenon remains unresolved. 

One extra thing: I would imagine most doctors are well aware that a university degree actually has a negative value, not £0 as it costs a significant amount of money. 

The chart states a value for a salary at five years but this information is not included in the source. The value £45,000 does not appear in the source. The average of the specialty doctor range listed above is around £53k however it should be noted that we don't know the actual distribution within this range. On a different page from the same site regarding GPs, the salary range is listed as between £55,412 and £83,617. The hours on that page are listed as 50. 

A blog post by Zoë Harcombe details a long list of problems with the conclusions of this study. She doesn't raise any problems with the methodology of the study, just the conclusions that have been drawn from it. Specifically to answer your question, no protein does not increase the risk of cancer. The study only claims that it does within a certain age group and within the other age group, it is actually associated with a lower risk of cancer. Many conclusions can be drawn from the study but only the ones that make animal protein sound bad actually were, which is suspicious: 

There is at least one proposal that Vikings sailed around the northern coast of Canada and made it as far south along the west to reach Vancouver Island. 

Meningitis can be caused by a bacterial infection or a viral infection. According to the CDC, viral meningitis is contagious only after symptoms appear and most stop being contagious when the symptoms go away. The same article also offers the following information about bacterial meningitis: 

Emil Maurice Maurice was a long-time friend of Hitler and was a member of the Nazi party before that party gained control of the German government. After being named the first supreme commander of the SA and after signing on as SS member number 2 (Hitler was member number 1) he was accused by Himmler of having Jewish ancestry. A law within the SS stated that all officers had to be able to prove racial purity back to 1750 and Maurice's great-grandfather, Charles Maurice Schwartzenberger (1805–1896), was Jewish. Himmler recommended that Maurice and all his brothers be expelled from the SS, but Hitler compelled Himmler to make an exception and allow them to stay as "Honorary Aryans." 

Your article is too long to address every piece of evidence in this format where we are limited to 30,000 characters. But there are problems even between the article and the evidence. For example, in the section on Randomized Controlled Trials on Wheat, you say: 

You claim is contrary to the abstract of the paper. It's worth noting that the fish results changed in the follow up paper as well. 

When a result is not significant, it is not significant. We can't use an insignificant result to make the claim that the "advice resulted on a 22% death increase". We also can't say that it "bordered on statistical significance" without further evidence that it actually did. We certainly can't predict the future outcome of a trial without actually conducting the trial. If we could, we would be even have trials? A couple of paragraphs from Reflections on the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART) illustrate some of the problems with trials of this sort that lead to insignificant data. In the past, fibre has been seen as having a protective effect rather than the detrimental effect your article is claiming. 

Is there any research that shows that one type of education is better than another, while accounting for the various demographic differences between private and public schools? 

I attended private schools from kindergarten through secondary school and was often told by the faculty that students who attended private schools got a better education, one that made them more prepared for college, than a public school education could provide. There are many issues that complicate a fair comparison between the two, including: 

Dog Saliva: At least one study on sciencedirect.com suggests that canine saliva is "bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Streptococcus canis but only slightly". An article on ABC's 20/20 reports that a dog's mouth is not cleaner than a human's mouth and the rapid healing of wounds observed in dogs is due to the constant licking removing dead tissue and stimulating circulation. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) lists a variety of infections that can be passed from dogs to humans, including: Campylobacter, Dipylidium, Giardia, Leptospira, Rabies, and Ringworm. Finally, a project submitted to the 2010 California State Science Fair comparing the antibacterial properties of dog saliva with Neosporin concludes that: 

It's difficult to determine exactly what this means. It could mean that one chicken wing is the equivalent of one cigarette, meaning that the Daily Telegraph's claim would suggest that a high protein diet means eating 20 chicken wings every day. 

This also implies that you do not have a license to practice medicine until after the two-year foundation programme which makes calling the salary you earn during this time a starting salary inaccurate. The source states directly after the starting salaries: 

Elsewhere, a specific value for top of the salary scale for tube drivers is listed as £49,673. ASLEF (the train driver's union) lists it as £48,133 Various sources state that London Tube drivers salaries do not change based on the time spent in the role. The chart states that doctors work "min 48" hours per week however the source document says 48 hours per week in one part and the maximum is 48 hours further down the page. 

I have heard that it is possible to unlock a car using the remote key-fob over a cell phone network. Scenario: Adam locks his keys in his car. He uses his cell phone to call his wife, Betty, who is at home with a cell phone. Adam holds his cell phone close to the car while Betty holds the spare remote close to her cell phone and pushes the UNLOCK button. Will this unlock the car door? 

It depends on the particular illness. With some diseases you can spread (be contagious) before symptoms appear, others you don't become contagious until after the symptoms appear. Viruses and bacteria have evolved to reproduce and migrate in different ways. Some spread by contact and can survive in open air for a long time--these could possibly live on external skin or be on kitchen counters, desks, pens, pencils, etc. and be transported to a new host when the new host comes in contact with the infected area. These are probably also most likely to spread before a host shows symptoms. Other types require a moist environment to survive and cannot exist in dry, open air. These would need to be spread via bodily fluids (saliva, sperm, blood, etc.) and are often spread through coughing or sneezing--hence the symptoms are there in order allow the organism to spread to a new host.
