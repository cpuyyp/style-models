There are a few methods to take into consideration when proposing changes at any company. Regardless of your position at the company. 1. Don't Play The Blame Game Never play the blame game. Even if you can see that all of the problems stem from one person. Playing the blame game will stir up a whole mess of politics in the work environment that you will be much better off without. Instead, suggest all of your improvements objectively, as team wide goals. 2. Confidence is Key Before you even think about suggesting these changes go through it all yourself, write up your ideas, then go through it again and again. Don't focus just on what changes to make, but also how you are going to suggest these changes. The changes need to seem simple and easy. If it takes you 20 minutes and 3 pages to detail a single change, it's probably too long and complicated with too many potential fail points for people to want to buy into it. Pay attention to weak points in your own arguments, make sure you have answers, and make sure they are good answers. "I don't know" can be a killer when trying to get people to accept your changes. Confidence is key, you need to seem like you know what you are doing, and you need to seem like you know how to do it. If you aren't confident in your changes, people won't be confident in you. 3. Bottom up Approach Before you go suggesting your ideas to the CEO you need to check that the rest of the company even agrees with you. Start with the people around you, the people you work with on a daily basis, talk to them about your ideas and see what they think. See what they like and what they dislike, and see if they agree that your changes would be for the best. Then move on to your manager, show him your changes, show him you have support from the rest of the team. Show him that it's in his or her best interest to pursue these changes and you will have their support. 4. Follow proper protocol Don't try to jump the gun, suggesting your changes to the top of the chain might seem like a good idea but if it hasn't gone through the proper internal processes then you're at a disadvantage. These internal process make sure that everyone who needs to see it and agree to it gets a chance to give their input, address their concerns, and suggest improvements. Getting buy in from your team is a difficult game to play, it involves making sure that they feel included, and that they feel their voice is being heard, it involves following proper procedure so that the change is bullet proof by the time it reaches people who can do anything about it. Be a subject expert But most importantly of all, you will need to know a lot about it, if you suggest the change you are likely to be the person needing to field all of the questions and concerns about the change. If you can't answer the questions or mitigate the concerns, you will lose backing. 

You can ask, but it is a long-shot. If they have a standard performance bonus, you would have received it. If they do not have a system of giving bonuses, you can be sure they aren't going to start it for one employee. If they have met your salary requirements, your best bet for further negotiations is to ask for more PTO, particularly if your compensation package has less (or not more) vacation than your previous job. Ultimately, though, there is no non-aggressive way to say: "Thanks for offering the money that I asked for, and said that I would be satisfied with. I'm ready to take the job if you just offer more money." 

My preferred way would be to tell my boss first, then privately tell those people that I work most closely with, allowing a chance to explain some of the reasons for my choice. After those that would be most effected by the decision already know (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of the team) I would mention it in a daily stand-up meeting. I would speak positively about how I will help in the transition, and make sure to express gratitude for the opportunity to work with the current team. And be brief. The reason I prefer to leak the information slowly is to take away the emotional impact of a "big reveal." 

Be Visible In my experience some of the first people to go are the ones who don't seem to do anything, the ones that clock in at 9, clock out at 5 and stick to themselves all day. The ones who no-one knows what they do or why they do it, sometimes your perceived value has more of an affect than your actual value. So the easy solution is to be more visible, a big project is coming up? Volunteer to help out! This both gets you more visible and also provides tangible value to the company, both helping them avoid needing to do lay-offs and helping to make sure you don't go first! Avoid the blame game You aren't going to make any friends by getting into a problem and immediately yelling "Joe did it!". Focus instead on helping to fix the underlying issues that caused Joe to do such a thing. Patching up faults and being a team player are important in developing vital relationships that could one day pull you out of trouble. Be one step ahead Ok so maybe something new has just been released in your field, maybe something that could be of importance or use to your company. This is the perfect opportunity for you to learn it before its needed so you have vital skills that your company can utilize! This both increases your worth and provides more value to your company, reducing the need for lay-offs in the first place. Go above and beyond Find out whats important to your boss, or your bosses boss!, and go out of your way to meet their expectations. Don't overwork yourself, but if you really want to be seen as a valuable person who they couldn't survive without then make sure you are really giving it your all! Core Projects Work on core projects that are vital to your companies success! If you work on peripheral projects you too will be seen as peripheral, the best way to be seen as core to the company is to work on its core money makers! Conclusion Either way all these suggestions are designed to either increase your worth to the company or to at least increase your perceived worth to the company. Maintaining both is important in ensuring you aren't the first for the chopping block. Most suggestions even have the advantage of making it easier to get more work if you do get laid off, which is a nice side effect! 

The offer you received was the first step in a negotiation. You can respond by saying you expected the advertised amount, and you can see where the negotiations go from there. Legal rights are almost irrelevant here, because you would almost never want to begin employment by taking your employer to court. 

It sounds like much of your unhappiness is with the client company. You could ask for a different assignment, but don't hold your breath. I've tried to obtain a different assignment while in your position, but your employer won't want to put you in a different position without being able to simultaneously back-filling your spot with your current client. Your situation is actually far better than when you took this job. Currently: 

My answer would be that this candidate did not only demonstrate arrogance, but also a lack of understanding of the difference between the things that he knows and the things that he does not know. Such a lack of understanding is crippling when trying to solve difficult technical problems. Since it appears that you role in the interview process was more on the technical side, you should focus on the technical failures. Evidently (and unfortunately) your input on the personal characteristics of the candidate are not being considered. 

No. I would share with him what your goals are, just because you think there is no room for movement it doesn't mean there isn't, your boss will probably know the situation better than you. Go into the meeting, and share with him what career path you want to take (or the one you would take if you left). Discuss with him if you think this path is possible within the company, if it isn't then you know you will have to leave to pursue it. If it is possible then hey you've just discovered that you can do the career you want without having to skip through jobs. You don't empirically know that you have no future in this job, but saying you want to leave means there is a much much smaller chance that you do. As far as i am aware the point of these review meetings is to review your performance for the last year AND your projected goals for this year, if you can honestly tell him what your goals are (move up the ladder etc) then chances are he can help plan a path with you. This means you get to be honest with him (as requested) and you get to discover whether you really do have a future at this company or not. Perhaps they never presented the situation to you because they were unaware you were looking to move up the chain, showing self motivation and determination might be just what they are looking for for a position thats just about to open up. It certainly can't hurt to try right? 

So re-open your job search, either immediately, or in a few months, depending on what you can tolerate. When you are asked about why you are looking so soon, just say: "I'm in a consulting role right now, but it isn't a good fit for me in the long term." Employers understand that consulting jobs involve less long-term commitment, even if you are a FTE of the contracting firm. In the meantime, do your best to learn and contribute all you can to your current team. Don't do heroic hours, but give a complete effort every day, and keep some hobby projects going to expand your skills. 

Your best bet here is to negotiate with the company that made you the offer. Tell them that you really hate giving up seven days of vacation, and ask if they could increase your vacation time in your first year. This is a negotiation, and they have no obligation to do it, but you do actually have leverage with them, where you have none with your current company. If they decline, you could ask if it would be acceptable to push back your start date a few weeks or a month to give you a chance to take some of your days off before giving notice. But asking for the company to do other than their policy with unused vacation days is a non-starter, and makes you look either greedy or naive. Try to leave well. 

Sure, you consult yourself out to him on your usual daily rates. The fact he is a friend just blurs the fact that this is still a business. Treat it like any other job, even draw up a contract based on time and cost and what your responsibilities will be. This means you can use the experience / credit like you would from any other job, stick it on your CV etc. This may also benefit your friend more than you can think of. For example perhaps this wake up call from you will help him realize what really goes into a project. What processes he really has to go through when requesting help from others, it will also help when they have to go through the process if they get a different contractor. It might be hard to do to your friend, but he isnt asking for your friendly advice, he is asking for your professional input, so thats how you have to do it, professionally. 

This man is your colleague, he is not your friend, and he is not your brother. While it is natural and often healthy for colleagues that work closely together to discuss non-work issues, you are never required to engage with him on that level. Since your colleague has taken advantage of your willingness to act as a friend, you need to stop being a friend. You should adopt an all-business persona when working with him. If he starts with a gloomy monologue, cut him off politely with "I'm sorry, but we really need to make progress with the X project." If he takes a break for his leering at a passerby, say, "If you aren't able to focus on our work here, perhaps we should move this meeting to a conference room." In short, minimize personal contact with him, while clearly communicating that you expect professionalism from him.
