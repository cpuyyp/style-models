Your question would seem to ask, “Why aren’t animal considered inherently evil?” Based on: If killing is ‘evil’ and a lion kills (instinctively for food and protection) that should make them ‘evil’. Only, over 80% of life on Earth consume other life forms. Would that make all of these life forms ‘evil’? The first, and most prominent source for the distinction of what ‘evil’ is, comes from Genesis. Evil showed up out of envy. Satan’s envy of humans, Adam and Eve, made him deceive them into doing what they were told not to. From then on, evil was part of our human values, but not animals. In the case of the lion, it is a lazy animal. Its life consists mostly of playing, napping, mating, and every so often, it kills for food. Taken out of its normal environment, it may kill since it is territorial and likes to maintain dominance. If lions were evil, we would have been in big trouble a long time ago. Evil (in the simplest distinction I’ve noted based on envy) would have lions invading and ravaging human villages, dragging out young children, and then leaving them to die, because humans consume meat, just like they do. Condensed Summation: Evil is an intentional act, to subjugate or eradicate, other life forms based on an errant idea of attaining or retaining dominance. Thanks for the exercise. 

Yes. Natural languages begin with agreement for abstract usages. Do Words Have Inherent Meaning Each individual piece develops into larger structures based on the need to communicate content. Once the agreement on the content is made, the language develops by usage. And, by usage alone. Dictionaries attempt to give the most common usages. If you do not understand the initial base agreements for a language it is all meaningless, in your personal POV. Both language and mathematics are based upon agreed abstractions. Mathematics has a greater commonality and distribution well beyond most common languages. That does not make it more meaningful to those who have the base understanding for it. That is a basic, superficial answer. There is an inherent human need to develop and learn to communicate with abstractions. Both Mathematics and languages satisfy that need. And, that primal instinct to connect and create legacies, cannot be tossed away as 'meaningless'. 

Boyd’s argument for scientific realism (scientific entities exist independently of us, and also have causal role phenomenally) looks circular due to the fact that the theses are posited without support. He states they are “philosophically uncontroversial.” I am suspicious whether he can hold the three theses consistently (I will not pursue this line of thought for the lack of time) 

happiness = the possession of objectively valuable things like love, knowledge, health, wealth and beauty (e.g., Arneson) 

is John Dalton who proposed the theory of atom in 1805 (cf., Leibniz: Prophet of New Era Science by J. Lawrenz). 

Let's see whether there is a solution to your question through the method of eliminative induction. Let's call your premise the duty of beneficence: 

Mark Andrews is in the right direction. I add some rudimentary idea from FOL(first order logic) model theory to make the answer more compelling. In a model theory, validity is defined as follows: all models that make the premises true make the conclusion true. So to show that the above argument is invalid, all you need to do is to come up with a model under which the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. 

"Does [Selfish desire has no place in the pure aesthetic experience] mean that purity comes with the consequence of selflessness? That if one is clean and pure they must be selfless?" No, no, no. the causal relationship is the other way around. It is not the selflessness that allows you to experience purity, but it is the purity of (aesthetic) experience that allows you to become self-less. Purity of (aesthetic) experience happens, when you read a great poem or watch an awesome movie, and you lose you spatio-temporal self and become the person in the poem or the movie. When I finally understood Robert Francis' Pitcher, I lost myself and became the Pitcher for a moment (the poem provided at the end of this post). Selflessness, for Blackburn, is not meant to be the opposite to selfishness. Rather it is the sublime self who is able to see things for their intrinsic values, no longer interpreting everything as an instrument to further one's needs and desires. By this way, the sublime self can also experience other values like the goodness. The hitherto self-interested self comes to understand that experiencing (doing) the good is intrinsically valuable, just as experiencing the beauty. In other words, the selflessness activated by the aesthetic experience is transmitted into the moral self (other-regarding self). This is why some argue that aesthetics is the mother of ethics (e.g., Marcia Eaton) The possibility of self-lessness through the aesthetic experience is important to Blackburn since such a possibility allows him to elaborate his projection theory. According to him, the reason that this world is a moral world, despite the absence of moral facts in this world (so-called the analytic world, world inhabited by brute facts), is that our moral values, just like aesthetic values, acquired through language games, are projected (or spread) onto the analytic world. Pitcher His art is eccentricity, his aim How not to hit the mark he seems to aim at, 

Law of non-contradiction is part of Cogito ergo sum. Other similar logic principles, where it is self defeating to doubt them. Such as saying "there is no absolute truth" which is itself an absolute truth if true. Finally, you can't prove that uncertainty means lack of knowledge. 

The issue is you're approaching the problem in a different direction. The theodicy you lay out is derived from these premises: 

The phrase you are looking for is the "beatific vision". It is the idea that our perceptions of beauty, truth and goodness in this world are a glimpse into a deeper reality which is accessed through the soul and self knowledge. The first occurrence I know of is in Plato's Republic, which explains how seeing the Forms frees a person from slavery and teaches them who they really are, and uses the city as an image of the soul in order to understand a correctly ordered soul. This theme is picked up by Christian philosopher theologians such as Boethius, Augustine, Justin Martyr, Bonaventure and Aquinas. It is also a standard hermeneutic principle during the Middle Ages, where the deepest meaning of religious scripture is how the soul achieves the beatific vision. In fact, it is the defining pursuit of philosophy and theology during this time. The best popular expression of this idea is the Divine Comedy by Dante, which is a story about the escape of the soul from a false understanding of self to achieving the beatific vision. 

Pascal's decision is based on the Bayesian decision theory which states that the rational course of action is the one that leads to the maximal expected utility. Pascal thus concludes that he should believe in God since believing in God offers infinite utility over not believing in God. I do not see any fallacy in his reasoning. If one rejects Pascal's conclusion, she must be regarding any of the above assumptions as unwarranted. But believing that the assumptions are false does not mean that the reasoning is fallacious. That is, if we accept the paradigm of the Christian God, and if accept all the assumptions (including the Bayesian method), one must accept the conclusion. With this, I respond to the claim that Pascal's argument is fallacious, following Conifold's suggestion, due to committing the fallacy of bifurcation. So the fallacy must lie in either Pascal 1 or Pascal 2. Pascal 1 is a tautology. So the fallacy should be in Pascal 2. Indeed Conifold seems to assert that Pascal 2 is a false dichotomy since there are other possible gods that Pascal neglects to consider to believe in. But considering other possible gods are irrelevant to Pascal's question, which is whether he should or should not believe in this particular God presented to him. The situation is similar to the case whether I should or should not love this woman. If Conifold points out to me that I neglected to consider all other possible women I could love, then surely Conifold is missing the question that I am asking. The existence of other women is irrelevant to my question since my question is whether I should or should not love this particular woman. For this reason, Pascal 2 does not commit the fallacy. 

To turn the question on its head - if physical matter in the form of a computer can be sentient and suffer, then should we say any configuration of matter that is minimally Turing complete is potentially capable of suffering? In which case, physical laws being Turing complete (because we can make computers) means the entire universe may be capable of suffering. 

Being an atheist is about as scientific as being anti-flying spaghetti monster. Now, scientists may by and large not believe in the FSM. But, what scientists believe is not the same as science. Science is hypotheses confirmed or invalidated by empirical evidence. If your hypotheses can neither be confirmed nor denied, then it isn't science. Therefore, atheism isn't scientific. 

It may appear to be possible to write an algorithm writing algorithm. In actuality, such an algorithm does not exist, due to the halting problem. While you can write an algorithm that outputs a list of instructions, the output is limited by the original algorithm, and only applies to a specific pre-defined goal. So, you cannot write an algorithm where you give it an arbitrary goal and it constructs an algorithm to reach the goal. 

At the national level it doesn't really make a difference. However, at the local level it does, and the politicians selected at the local level can have a larger influence. 

Well, your very question has the same dilemma...Billions of people think they can know things, many others think they cannot. Many in both camps are very smart, well educated, etc. If your premise is correct, that smart people on both sides of an issue means the average person cannot have confidence in a position, then it must apply just as well to your question. Therefore, if your premise is correct, then you cannot know whether your premise is correct. On the other hand, if your premise is incorrect, then you can know it is incorrect. So, no answer here in the affirmative can be correct, as it would be self refuting. Now, if we say the only two possible answers are yes or no, then by disjunction elimination the conclusion must be that you can indeed know things. This is a sound/valid deductive argument. 

The fallacy gets its name from the practice of training a hunting dog. A red herring, a fish with very strong scent, is dragged across the trail with the aim of leading dogs astray. Only the best dogs will follow the original scent. 

Michael used the fallacy of equivocation. The fallacy happens when the same word is employed to refer to different things or ideas. Michael's rhetorical goal is to appeal to the emotions of the listeners that they should not listen to Toby since Toby is a loner who belongs nowhere. For this, Michael employs 'family' equivocally. Michael used 'family twice. His second use of 'family' is what 'family' commonly means: mommy, daddy,.. His first use of family is quite thin notion of family (e.g., community-feeling). 

This objection utilizes your complaint that a probabilistic argument does not prove much. The affinity argument only asserts the akiness in properties between the soul and the Form. Since all Socrates showed is that the soul is more like objects in the world of the Form, it is still possible that the soul after all does not belong to the world of the Form. Thanks to the aforementioned properties, the soul can be placed higher than the body, but lower than the Form. In other words, it can be placed inbetween mortal existence and immortal existence, possessing a demigod-like existence. So, the soul might have a longer life than the body, but would die eventually. This objection is essentially Cebes' weaver argument (87a-88b). According to the weaver argument, the soul in the body is like a man (weaver) wearing a cloak (weaver:cloak::soul:body). The weaver outlasts many cloaks, but he doesn't outlast all cloaks. Similarly, even if the soul survives the deaths of some bodies, this doesn't mean that it survives the deaths of all bodies. 

Most philosophy does not delve into how the universe as a whole, (or this planet in particular as an object), came into being. Philosophy is mostly engaged with how we relate and perceive our existence and the connections that those perceptions may create. That is the 'being' part of philosophy. Functionally, we are creatures of magnificent adaptation. Human beings have learned not only live, but to thrive, on almost every natural environment on the planet. So, "How does being come into being?" As soon as there is consciousness of being, there is being. Aristotle created the initial metaphysical idea in Being Qua Being (Being On Being), Ontology. I prefer to consider it in modern terms as Qua Being Qua (On Being On). The difference is that, after many centuries, we are well trained from an early age focus on who we are in the world. The 'Qua' essence is what philosophies are now formulating as the abstract principals we bring 'into being'. People 'know' each other by 'how they be. Short version; Philosophy will not be able to help you answer the questions of creation. It will assist you to look at what it means to be made from the dust of stars, and create your own poetry (and value) for that. 

Freedom as a action, is distinguished by the ability to cause/create/respond/react, and not a lack of consequences that may follow those actions. While the examples you use limit the distinction to the subjective, psychopathic, moral and ethical notions of Freedom, as cited in your question, what Freedom signifies in an individual and society is much broader in definition. 

God is moral, and logically cannot be the source of evil Evil exists The only source of evil is free will 

Notice that the starting premise is that God is not evil. Anselm's ontological argument underlies this notion. If God were evil, there would be an even greater being than God, which is a contradiction. Therefore, God is not evil. So, the theodicy is derived by eliminating possibilities, and the only logical possibility left is that humans and other beings with free will are the authors of evil. The problem with other theodicies, such as your own, is that denying any premise #1-3 is philosophically problematic. It isn't that there is some conspiracy to avoid saying God is evil or the author of evil, as that suggestion has been proposed many times (e.g. Homeric gods) and is actively believed by certain Christian and other religious sects today. Each premise was arrived at independently from the theodicy, and when you put them together you get the theodicy. That being said, it doesn't quite make sense to me either. Being able to choose evil is not a necessary condition for having free will, as God can't choose evil yet has free will. The same goes for heavenly beings in general. If I were God, I wouldn't have given people the ability to be evil. However, it seems to be the only logical possibility once you accept premises #1-3.
