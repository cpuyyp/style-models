Before Berkeley, Malebranche had indeed bereaved the Cartesian form of cogito in its relation to feeling, in opposition to idea. The connection between Berkeley and Malebranche is appealing especially in description of spirit, but it’s clear that Berkeley himself forbade it from the beginning. The decisive point is the activity and relative power that Berkeley attached to limited spirits. 

The two first waves hold a key revealed in a methodological sub-section: the logos or principle of intelligibility of the whole section. In the first wave, the keyword is nature (physis) and in the second wave, it’s community (koinonia). Physis is nearest to the inferior part of the soul, and koinonia or harmony is the keyword that awaits the task of the soul's median to manage the potential conflit between passions and reason. More specifically: The question in the discussion on collective education of men and women is the problem of the nature of man, who represents form, and woman who represents matter according to the thought of generative process at the time. What Plato may want to suggest, is that it’s not worth denying the material dimension or the spiritual dimension of our nature, to want to limit man and everything real to the assembly more or less complex of matter, or trying to elevate the status of some disembodied and liberated idea of the matter. Man must instead start by recognizing his true nature; to be accepted as he is: namely a material and spiritual being, male and female, each component of its nature having found its proper place and to bring its specific contribution to the development of its being. The discussion on the community of women and children concerns the activity of man: children can be viewed as a figure of the product of the combined activity of form and matter, that is to say our actions. What’s suggested here is that a man will mount to nothing as much as he considers each of his actions satisfactory to a part of his being at the expense of others. He must look at all his actions as the product of all his being and act in a manner that each part of himself always finds in his conduct his part of satisfaction. Both waves taken in context, the domination of reason in the third wave is not pure rationalism but the realization of the superior part of our soul as the most apt to lead, not to crush the two others, but as a master fit to his name, acting in the best interest of everything, spirit and matter, body and soul, in accordance to will. 

This fourth who is in prosperity is described by Marx. It’s the selfish bourgeois that puts forward that everyone follows his own ends and that it’s the least harm we can do for the entirety of humanity. On the factual map, Kant admits the premises of this reasoning. Rational selfishness is without doubt a good move and could even be profitable to humanity. But we cannot want it without contradicting ourselves. Therefore, an applicable and advantageous principle to the entirety of humanity is not sufficient; it still has that I may want it as I am a rational-reasonable being. 

Utilitarians place themselves on the map of our spontaneous tendencies and what is feasible without contradiction whereas Kant breaks radically with this conception in placing himself from the human will perspective. I can so I want, says the utilitarian. I must, so I can, replies Kant. At the same time, this shows how much utilitarians are far from having the depth and amplitude of sight required by moral philosophy. 

– Kantian ethics. NB: The distinction between good and evil is inherent to human reason. In science, we know the justification process of an assertion: logical coherence, systematical coordination of experimental results, predictive capacity; there is nothing such in ethics because there are no “experimental results”; because ethics has nothing to do with facts as facts. Should there be myriads of liars and a high enough number of murderers, this tells us nothing on the moral values of lying or murder. The “moral justification” always connects with a certain moral doctrine that is presupposed. There are utilitarian justifications of falsehood or murder, but these same acts do not have any justification in Kantian morals. Therefore, we cannot say utilitarianism stands on moral justifications since these justifications presuppose themselves the acceptance of utilitarianism. – Utilitarian ethics. – Utilitarian ethics. NB: Moral principles can never justify themselves rationally, but are justified in accordance with the desires of man. – Utilitarian ethics. NB: We should follow the morals of established rules without forgetting that they are generalizations that can be distributed in exceptional cases, because they are not restrictive principles of conduct. Man has the right to be happy. In his answer to Benjamin Constant, On the Supposed Right to Tell a Lie from Altruistic Motives, the argumentation of Kant is in fact very utilitarian, despite refusal of any consequentialist criteria in the Kantian doctrine. Why should the right to lie be refused even in the case where a lie would save a human life? Kant gives two arguments: 

The author invites subsequently to transpose this demonstration at every other object of knowledge. It is as vain to search the seventeeness of 17, than the keyboardness of a keyboard, for example. Henceforth, despite his status of great philosopher, all that Plato can say of it are its properties, namely its relations. And when he arguments that the keyboard that I see at this moment is a copy of the Idea of the keyboard, that does not reveal anything more of its intrinsic nature than to say that it is black or constituted of atoms. That’s what should be understood: there is no absolute for pragmatism. “Absolute” signifies here “isolated from the rest”. And yet how speak of something that is isolated of everything? It is absurd. All knowledge (or belief) must be registered in a language; as soon as there is language, there is relation. 

This doctrine seems moreover in close relation with the perspectivism of Nietzsche. We can very well interpret in an anti-essentialist sense from this affirmation: 

This is an utilitarian type of argumentation: it’s good for humanity in its entirety that the principle of word given can be held as valid; it’s always preferable for me not to lie, it’s the strategy that will spare the troubles in which we fall inescapably as soon as we start lying. – Kantian ethics. NB: Moral ethic of intention to act freely, by respect of moral law and not by desires or dispositions. Moral value is not placed in the goal to attain, but higher, on a principle that determines the work in question. An individual act is moral when it’s determined to act by respect of the practice of moral law. 

It’s ironic that Locke’s commonsense approach to philosophy should have influenced Berkeley to formulate a philosophical position that at first seems so much at variance with common sense. He became the object of severe criticism and ridicule for denying what seemed most obvious to anyone. Berkeley had set out to deny the existence of matter. Since the science of his day, particularly physics, relied so heavily on the notion of matter, Berkeley had to come to terms with its assumptions and methods. Science had assumed that we can, and must, distinguish appearance and reality. Locke had said that substance, or matter, supports or acts a substitute for the qualities we sense. In Berkeley’s “First Dialogue between Hylas and Philonus”, Hylas expresses Locke’s view: “I find it necessary to suppose a material substratum, without which [qualities] cannot be conceived to exist.” Philonus replies that the word substratum has no clear meaning for him and that he would want to “know any sense, literal or not literal, that you understand in it.” But Hylas admits that he cannot assign any definite meaning to the term substratum, saying “I declare I know not what to say.” From this the conclusion is drawn that “the absolute existence of unthinking things [matter] are words without meaning.” This is not to say that sensible things do not possess reality but only that sensible things exist only insofar as they are perceived. This, of course, implies that only ideas exist, but Berkeley adds that “I hope that to call a thing ‘idea’ makes it no less real.” His influence was nevertheless significant, but it was his empiricism and not his idealism that had a lasting influence. Building on Locke’s empiricism, Berkeley made the decisive point that the human mind reasons only and always about particular sense experiences – that abstract ideas refer to no equivalent reality. Hume, who was to carry empiricism to its fullest expression, spoke of Berkeley as: 

QM explains that since Kant, philosophy has become “correlationist”. The premise of correlationism is that we do not know the matter in itself, but only the connection of thought to the matter. According to the definition of QM, correlationism consists in disqualifying all claims, to consider the spheres of subjectivity and objectivity independently from one another. So intersubjectivity, the consensus of a community, was destined to substitute to the adequacy of representations of a solitary subject to the matter itself, as a case of authentic criteria of objectivity, and more specially of scientific objectivity. Thought can then no longer think anything independent from it, and QM asks the following question: how can science “produce statements” on what existed well before the emergence of all thought? QM, who expresses himself often grandiloquently, names archifossile everything that shows the existence of a reality previous to the emergence of thought. According to QM, it’s the mathematization of scientific statements that allow them to treat ancestral objects (previous to the emergence of thought in his terminology). In one passage, Meillassoux describes the way “modern philosophers” interpret the ancestral statements of science: in adding a simple codicil. This allows these philosophers to comfort their belief in possessing a deeper meaning of the scientific statements than their literal sense, qualified naïve. Correlationism, in tackling all forms of rational discourses on the absolute via the notion of fictiousness, has finally reinforced the fideist position. Indeed, correlationsim destroys all claim to justify as much as critique any religious views. For the modern philosopher, it would be vain to tackle the internal contradictions to a belief, because it possesses an incommensurable meaning in the rational sense. Correlationism does not root positively a belief, but removes effectively all pretention of the reason to delegitimize a belief in the name of unthinkability of its content. The condemnation of fanatism is done [henceforth] in the only name of its practical effects (ethico-politics), never in the name of the eventual falsehood of its content. The solution of QM consists not in refuting frontally correlationism, that he holds as impossible, but to absolutize its principle: the absolute contingency of all being. 

What the German philosopher affirms here is that all our knowledge – that is interpretative – must necessarily be connected to a perspective, that is first and foremost human. It’s now the turn of the metaphysical distinction between “relative” and “absolute” to fall. Of course, there is very certainly a form of relativism that stays with anti-essentialism. But this relativism must not be understood in the traditional sense that “everything has value”. Admitting the relativity of things, comes to simply say that: 

A hasty read of this quote can make us believe that Berkeley does not understand well the thought of Malebranche, since he implicitly accuses him to have conceived that we have have an idea of our soul, when we know that Malebranche opposed the inner feeling to the idea. Malebranche means by idea a paradigm that permits to know a thing. Berkeley knows well, also, that Malebranche believes that we do not dispose of this paradigm by ourselves for what is our soul, and it’s in this that we make a simple sense. If the Malebranchist feeling is not an idea in the Malebranchist sense, it stays an idea in the Berkeleian sense. We can call this internal experience conscientia or feeling, we always conceive it as it were some perception, even if it’s vague. Its exactly the same motive that lead Berkeley to conceive the notion of an operation of the spirit completely differently from an idea of reflection à la Locke, in spite of verbal proximity and established usage in the vocabulary of thought. 

And this retort, one of the most popular in philosophy: “Oh! Now we fall into relativism!”; to which Rorty replies that even though there are no absolute truths, we can’t say “anything”, because:
