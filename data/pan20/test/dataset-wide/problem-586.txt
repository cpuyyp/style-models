I strongly recommend socks that can breathe easily and that absorb and wick away sweat. That means probably not cotton athletic socks you'd get in bulk at a warehouse store. Personal preference determines the coloration and logos, and if you're worried about style, get socks that match your kit and your shoes. Also if your alma mater has a cycling team, contact them and see if you can buy team socks. You'll be able to show school pride wherever you're riding, and they'll be quality. 

Remove the tire, innertube, and rim tape from the wheel. Using a spoke wrench, loosen and remove the nipples. If you are using the same spokes, remove the spokes from the old hub. Lace the wheel, making ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that the valve will be in the right place. Check out Sheldon Brown's step-by-step wheelbuilding page for the procedure of lacing a 3x (three-cross) wheel. You will want to use a little bit of vaseline on the threads of each spoke so you can tighten the nipples more easily. Go to a nearby bicycle cooperative (you can google bicycle co-op near nameofyourtown) to use a truing stand, and use the truing stand to adjust the wheel. Make sure the wheel is dished properly and that you have proper tension on the spokes. 

External bottom brackets have been appearing on higher-end bikes in the last few years. Can older bikes with bottom bracket shells that come stock with square taper internal ISO 68mm or oversized ISO 73mm bottom brackets be retrofitted with external cups when it comes time to replace the bottom bracket? I am well aware that the cranks will have have to be replaced, too. 

I remember which way to go by turning the pedal wrench toward the back of the bike because to undo the pedal, you have to go backward. To tighten the pedals, turn it toward the front because once you have the pedals on, you can go forward. 

If the effective top tube (horizontal measurement) is OK for you - then the only other things I can think of might be the head tube angle & chainstay length. A road bike may have a steeper head angle & also have shorter chainstays. Which quickens the handling & steering. Mind you, at the smaller end of the road bike sizing - the head angles tend to be a little slacker which helps with toe overlap. So head angle also depends on size. Best thing to do is a compare a few geometries from a manufacturer for hybrid and road. There isn't a hard and fast rule for geometries. Also consider spacers as an alternative to a riser stem - might save you a few pennies. 

Taken from the Team Sky nutritionist's recommendations. Although it is for breakfast the guidelines for what to look for in your pre-race diet still stand. 

$URL$ This link might be helpful. It describes only two grades of alloy for their current bikes. The higher grade being hydroformed. Hydroforming allows profiling and shaping of the tubes. Its comparative to blow moulding. With respect to then older tubesets - I seem to remember the differences being grade and butting. The higher end frames using lighter tubesets and triple butted. Most bike manufacturers in those days bought in their high end tubes from possibly the likes of Easton. 

Not directly linked to the question but interesting all the same - I saw a health program on telly last night - it had an article in it about exercising before or after breakfast (breakfast being carb based). It concluded - for fat burning - women were better off after breakfast and men better off before. They didn't go into huge detail but it was thought the reasoning was men having more muscle mass and therefore more glycogen storage capability. Iirc - the men burnt on avg 8% more over those men who exercised after breakfast. 

I think if you are willing to spend a few hours, it's worth doing yourself. Depending on the flange size of the new hub, though, you may need to buy new spokes. You can determine the length of the spokes you will need using a spoke length calculator. You will need a spoke wrench, a flat-head screwdriver, some vaseline, and the use of a truing stand. Here's what you'll have to do: 

Because spokes stretch a little and settle in after you start riding, be prepared to true the wheel after the first couple rides. If you are not interested in making your own wheel, I recommend just buying a new wheel with the hub you want. It may be cheaper than getting your lbs to rebuild your wheel with your new hub. 

From my experience racing USAC Collegiate xc and short track, disc brakes are the way to go, and I prefer hydraulic to mechanical, as long as they're the right model. You can find a lot of reviews on the mtbr.com forum about disc brakes to find one that would work for you. The Avid Elixir R SLs I use on my full-suspension mtb have never let me down and are easy to adjust. From general riding experience, disc brakes are much more responsive in dusty and wet situations than v-brakes are. Disc brakes provide another advantage during race situations: If you flat during a race, you just have to flip your bike over, open the quick-release and pull the wheel off. Since disc brakes don't go around the tire like rim brakes do, you don't have to disengage or reengage the brakes when you pull the wheel off or put it back on. Also if you're running rim brakes and you hit a rock during a race that makes your wheel go out of true, your rim will be hitting the brake pads while you ride, which can end your hopes of placing. With disc brakes, your braking power is not affected by the trueness of the wheel. You'll probably want to true the wheel when you get back to your tent, but your race isn't over if you're running discs. 

I've raced a bit and crashing is a part of the racing. After every crash - the worst one being actually on the road - riding headlong into a car - I completely lose confidence on the bike. Its like a fear of the next accident waiting around the corner. I rebuild confidence by riding cross or mountain bike. I relearn all the bike handling skills - I tend to lose on the road bike. The advantages being no cars and a soft landing. 

Freehub bodies tend to be hub specific. So the chances of Shimano doing an interchangeable one is remote. Freehub bodies can be significantly expensive when compared to the price of a cheap/moderate wheel - so might be more economical to replace the complete wheel - especially when you factor in not only the cost of the freehub but also the cost of labour to fit. 

Single-sided power meters have existed since the "year dot" - and opposite leg power is often "extrapolated" from a single strain gauge And given most power-meters will quote accuracy to be within X% - the use of left and right strain gauges means although accuracy could be within X% of both left and right - it causes problems with precision. So the maximum variation between both strain gauges could be LEFT DRIFT + RIGHT DRIFT. (But both being within X% of true strain). So there is an argument which questions whether left and right power meters are in fact more accurate. And it is possibly the magic of the software / firmware further downstream from the strain gauge signal which provides a coherent reading. From your graph you have posted - you have tight banding of power on the left leg which indicates a smooth pedal stroke on the left-side. Your right side looks choppy like you're stamping on the pedals. This is often described as "pedalling squares". The important thing with power meters is precision (consistency) of the reading. In direct answer to your question - why do people use single-sided power meters - it has inherently been the cost of dual-sided power measurement. However, in the last 2 years - cheaper pedal-based systems have appeared from Garmin and more recently Favero. 

My grandpa gave me his old 1974 Raleigh International (all original Campy) as a graduation present. Since the stock wheels are for tubular tires, and I do want to ride it around town, I want to get wheels for clincher tires so I can change the inner tube when I flat rather than having to mess with glue jobs. A new rear wheel means that I can have an option of getting a rear wheel with shimano hyperglide so I can choose modern cassettes. Because the shifters are friction shifters rather than indexed shifters, does it matter how many cogs are in the cassette? Do I have to stick with 5 or could I even go to 10? I stand corrected that the frame is steel and not alumninum. I was mistaken because the bike is significantly lighter than other steel-framed bikes I have dealt with. I apologize for this error. 

The 2000 miles is an estimate of when the chain will stretch. Your chain may last longer than that. As far as replacing it goes, I think it depends on your financial situation. If you can easily afford a new chain, I recommend buying one. A replaced chain means that you don't have to worry about your current chain stretching beyond the limit and damaging your bike. If your budget makes buying a new chain difficult, you'll be all right to keep riding. Just check the chain stretch every so often to determine when it's getting near absolutely necessary to buy a chain. 

Always be careful about carbon fiber and collisions. Carbon fiber is light and strong, but it's very fragile and can break unexpectedly because you can't always see the cracks. In one of my collegiate mtb short track races, a guy snapped his carbon fiber handlebar at the stem after a 1' drop because the handlebar took abuse over time. When it lost all strength, the effect on the equipment was catastrophic. So in your case, if the crash was strong enough to throw you over the hood of the car to the other side, it probably messed up the carbon fork, even if you can't see it. When riding bikes, I've found the fork to be particularly useful, so certainly have the fork checked out, but be prepared to junk it for your own safety.
