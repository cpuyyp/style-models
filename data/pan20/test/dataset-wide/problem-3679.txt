I am 5 feet and 4 inches high. I am weighing 83kg these days. My tummy has bulged out, looking bad. I am caring for my diet, having lemon water in morning. But now i want to do gym exercises to reduce weight. I have seen many people having good shaped body but they look bulky, even they have 6 packs but their tummy looks fat similar is for legs and biceps, triceps. I have also seen skinny people with good shaped bodies. By skinny i mean this Question: How to do exercise in gym to look like skinny body? Which exercises i should do? Is this possible what i am asking? Having skinny body, does that depend on exercises you do or on nature of your body? 

I am 27 years of age. I am 5.4 feet tall. I am weighing 80kg these days(BMI 29.6). I want to reduce it to 67kg(BMI 25) Three months ago, when i started gym i was weighing 84kg. I cut out sugar,bakery items from my diet, no cold drinks, no junk food. With that i was able to reduce my weight to 80kg. My diet is same now a days but i am observing that my weight is not reducing now rather it is stable. When i talked to the gym instructor he told me to use fat burner for this purpose. Questions: Should I use Fat Burner or do more exercise? Are the fat burners good for body? Do they work? What are the pros and cons fo using fat burner? My workout routine: Monday Chest exercises: 1.

What's happening is that you're burning more fuel because your body has to keep itself cool (which is why you're sweating). If you want to gain weight, you need a caloric surplus. So if you have a hard time consuming enough calories then you might want to stop wearing all of these clothes in order to make your body burn less calories. If you don't have a problem consuming these extra calories, then you might aswell train like this is you prefer it. 

Just to be clear, bodybuilding is a sport of patience. You won't achieve your goals in 1, 2 or even 6 months. That being said, if I'm reading your question correctly, you're already doing sets of 25. In this case, you're better off increasing the weight, rather than the amount of reps or sets. If you can't increase weight for some reason, you can try different variations of bicep curls, as well as concentrating on the negative part of the movement. Try some sets going up in 1 second, and down in 3 or 4 seconds. You'll find out it will get increasingly harder to do. 

TLDR: There isn't a specific angle you should be at, but your arms shouldn't be locked out. The most important thing to know is that you don't want your arms to be fully stretched or locked out. This will put a lot of stress on your elbow joint and cause injuries. 

It might be that your arms are in such an angle that bloodflow is slightly cut off, which would cause this feeling of going numb. Are you doing the dips behind your body (assuming you are since the title says chair dips)? In that case you could try doing dips on parallel bars. This way your arms aren't as far back (basically next to your body) which could solve the problem. Hope it helps. 

It seems inherently strange that stretching may offer no proven benefit. Unless something has drastically changed since PT school, the research I've seen and what the professional consensuses seems to be support is mixed. 

NOTE: These are being provided to help you better understand what is happening. You MUST have this evaluated by your local PT and they will create your treatment plan accordingly. 

Hormone Release: Increases GLP-1: Delays the speed of digesting food (kind of like fiber reduces sugar spikes). GLP-1 reduces the speed of glucose intake. PYY: A hormone released after eating, it inhibits gastric motility and increases water and electrolyte absorption in the colon. When released it reduces appetite. Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP): Is a gut hormone released in response to ingestion of food. Plasma PP has been associated with decreased appetite and food intake. 

Possibly hip and altered neuromuscular firing patterns. Iâ€™ll wait to go any further till I have more info. 

Symptoms Your child may have pain in the elbow during or after activity without significant swelling or redness. The pain may travel down the forearm. Pain usually begins gradually without one specific injury to the joint. The pain may improve with rest, but often returns when the activity (such as tennis) is resumed. Some individuals notice decreased grip strength on the affected arm. 

Can't speak from experience but there are studies -- However I don't see a reason to post these. Are you just asking this to see if they'd work for you - or what's your plan? You do realize any weight you lose or muscle gained from "roids" (working out or otherwise) you'd lose once you stop taking them. There are some great rebound effects you'll experience which include damaged or desensitized androgen receptors, lower levels of bound and free T-testosterone along with increased estrogen and progesterone levels. There are also plenty of life-altering, permanent and lethal side effects (yes, really) that would stick with you. 

I would suggest doing heavy compound movements like deadlifting, squatting and bench pressing. Preferably doing sets of no more than 5 reps. You can even build up to 1-3 reps on extra heavy sets. Add isolation exercises to each muscle group and do higher reps on these, 8 to 12 reps per set. You could also add some cardio but this isn't necessary so if you enjoy cardio go for it, if you don't, don't. As for food, I would suggest finding out what ammount of calories you need to maintain what you already have. I'd go for a diet high in protein to build muscle. If you eat to many carbs you might find it hard to lose the excess fat, even though that is very personal (I personally don't gain fat on a high carb diet but I know a lot of people that do). 

TLDR: Yes you can, but you'll be doing the same stuff over and over, which your body will get used to. The basics are that it's calories in vs calories out when it comes to weight loss, so doing what you're saying will work to lose weight (if your diet is good). Your body will get used to the movement that you're doing though, so the results might decrease after a long period of doing the same thing a few times a week. To lose weight it might also be a good idea to start swimming, it's great because it won't put a lot of strain on your joints which can be a problem for overweight people. 

Use Your Weaker Arm More This may seem odd, but try to use your weaker arm for some more everyday activities. Open doors, carry groceries, drink water, eat meals, etc. with your weaker arm. It will help you become more comfortable using your weaker arm and over time will help you become more comfortable using it in the gym which will improve your neuromuscular efficiency. 

Research confirms no single core exercise challenges all of the abdominal musculature while not harming the back. Multiple exercises are required to strengthen the core and related muscles. Unfortunately there are many inappropriate exercises unsafe for most people. These exercises does not help relieve back pain, but instead increases low-back damage because of high compressive forces placed on the lower spine: 

UPDATE Just to clarify. What part of the foot (optimally) strikes first depends upon speed - Above ~120 steps/min you can no longer increase the stride length. This marks the transition from walking to jogging/running and occurs at ~190 cm/sec. So you want to start jogging when you start to feel like you have to. Jogging too soon is similar to jogging in place (wasted effort and energy). Without going into plantar pressures and a joint by joint kinematics -- have a few days? ;) - I'll leave it there and can clarify further if needed. My other answer may be helpful to you as well. 

NOTE: As you keep saying efficient in your post. I'm not taking efficiency into account here, just workload and substrate utilization. 

First of all, the way your abs look is purely genetics. If there isn't a big separation between your abs, you'll never really be able to see it properly, this is why some people have a 4 pack, some have 6, some have 8. That being said, you probably have to lose a bit more fat. You don't need to do cardio to burn fat if you don't want to. If you keep your diet in check, doing compound movements is enough. They burn a lot of calories as well as build muscle. Doing squats and deadlifts will also be working your core, so you'd be losing fat and gaining core strength. 

You can do a lot at home though, as you said. You could look into resistance bands. They can help getting a better posture a lot. It's important to first find out what's currently "wrong" with your posture, and then find exercises accordingly. If your shoulders are rotated forward, push-ups will only make this worse, because it will strengthen the front of your upper body, and overpower the back. Another important fact is that, a lot of possible posture "malfunctions" to call it that, are found in how you place your feet, how you move/rotate your hips, and if your core if strong enough, so keep in mind that, even though the top of your body might look like there is something wrong with your posture, the problem might be found in your hips for example.
