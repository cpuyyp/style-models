If this is a stem... ... what's this? I'm asking because I need to buy a taller one so I don't have to bend over as far. It's not convenient to buy a new bike, and I already have an adjustable stem which just doesn't quite get me there. 

I feel dumb asking this, but how should the chain be routed around the cogs on this deraillier? I had to split the chain and then put it back on. I didn't pay attention to how it went round. This is not the right way (below) as the chain is extremely slack. 

Use tubes to make U-locks (or anything) less prone to scratching your frame. My U-lock's base has bare metal which scratches my frame. I cut the circular tube to make it one straight tube. Then I lay one end along the metal of the base of the U-lock. Then I wrapped it tight around itself as if I was wrapping handlebar tape. Then on the last wrap I left it slightly looser so I could put the loose end underneath the last wrap and then I pulled it tight. It stays put fine. You can slip a section of tube over the "U" of the U-lock and then roll up the ends (like shirt sleeves) so it keeps it in place. 

I am buying a second hand frame (Dawes 201 hybrid) build up (first time doing that, so exciting). I'm paying cash on collection, so can back out if anything looks wrong. What should I look for on the frame to make sure it's up to scratch?. 

I weigh about 120 kilos. Saddle rails bend. I don't care about the weight of the saddle, just how strong the rails are and how comfy it is (I admire but have no desire to emulate people who cycle standing up. I have a bmi over 30, give me some credit for voluntarily cycling 20 miles a day) 

Use the old style seatpost that ends in a nub. Attach your saddle to an old style saddle clamp. Replace the bolt on the saddle clamp with some quick-release bolt or winged/knobbed bolt. The saddle and clamp might separate on loosening and removal, however. See if a removable seatpost head clamp would attach to a nub-ended seat tube. Maybe you'd have to saw the end of a seat tube that fits, and find a removable seatpost head clamp that fits the correct diameter. The advantage with this is that the head would clamp to your saddle separately from clamping to the seat tube. Perhaps modify the clamp so that it is quick-release by adding your own QR collar or replacing a bolt. These types seem to be related to "integrated" seatposts. Another one. Also, search for Cannondale Synapse seatpost clamp. 

In my experience with various internal gear hubs on Dutch bikes, I found there's no maintenance necessary: I've never heard of them breaking down because of lack of maintenance. Here's a blog post that concurs. My current Gazelle bike manual also does not explicitly mention any maintenance on the hub gears, only how to adjust them. 

Although The Netherlands is pretty flat (highest point 321m in southern Limburg), there certainly are some hills, even closer to Amsterdam: 

My commute has always been about that distance, and when temperatures reach around freezing point, I simply wear a ski jacket which has ventilation shafts under the armpits. Opening these helps me a lot from sweating, and you can easily adjust them. Also thin (e.g. running) gloves can help: they break the cold wind, but allow you to transpire. And finally, like in warm weather: don't rush too much. 

I have a wheel with a puncture. It seems to be a pinch flat (the air is shooting out in the direction of the rim) but I can't get the tyre off to investigate. This is an ex-tubeless tyre that I put a tube in once. Guess I should have cleaned up the sealant first. Now I can't even move the tyre, let alone remove it. The rim is aluminium. Is there a powerful solvent that is safe to use, that would weaken the old Stan's + muck glue? I googled around this, and most answers are 'be a man! use tyre levers! No, they're for girls, use your thumbs!'. Well, I'm beat. I have poor muscle tone and bad motor skills for medical reasons, so I accept the possibility that 'normal' people could just pull it off. I, however, can't. The suggestion here was use a credit card but that didn't work. I could take it to the bike shop, but something tells me this isn't the last time something like this will happen. I'd like a solution for next time. I need a solvent that won't attack the aluminium. Ideally I'd like to save the tyre/tube, but that's a bonus. Edit: whoever suggested a vice, that worked. It unstuck the tyre and I could remove it normally with tyre levers. 

There's a very simple way to accurately estimate this: use Boyle's gas law which states that the product of pressure and volume is constant. Thus if the air volume in your tire decreases by 10% (which I think is a huge overestimate), then the new volume V2 is 0.9 times the old volume V1. Hence the new pressure P2 must be 1/0.9 = 1.11 times the old pressure, i.e. pressure increased by 11%. I'd conclude that pressure is barely affected by the weight of the person, if the tire has enough pressure to support you in the first place. 

About 4 miles away from me, there is a bike hire shop that has tandems. I'm trying to work out the logistics of getting the tandem to my house to pick up the other rider. I'm an experienced cyclist, but have never ridden a tandem before. It's not convenient for both of us to go to the shop. Is riding a tandem particularly difficult for one person? I suppose I'll get the bus there... 

My saddle's rails have become bent so that the saddle is askew. Rather than get a new saddle, is there any way to replace just the rails? I assume bending them back is useless, as even if i could get them totally straight they would be weakened and just bend again. 

Where is the ideal / designed location for my sit bones to push on a leather sling/hammock style saddle? (Relative positioning, that works for any saddle width) While I'm riding on my leather saddle, I notice that my sit bones seem to press the saddle very close to the rear metal part of the saddle (i.e. near the rivets). This metal bar with the rivets is U-shaped, with the tails curving forwards at each side. Are my sit bones supposed to fit within the curve? In front of it? Referring to the grid below, my intuition is that I should get a wider saddle with a wider metal U such that my sit bones are in the relative locations of: center-of (C-D,2-3) and center-of (C-D,4-5). Am I correct that the U should "cradle" my sit bones? (Also, I notice most leather saddles use 6 rivets in the rear, so we can refer to them as rivet #1 through #6.) 

I need to replace my chainwheel and cassette, and it made me think. I know that the chain has to be a specific length relative to the number of teeth on the gears. I was thinking about changing the cassette for one which a bigger 1st gear. Suppose I could get one with whatever number of teeth I wanted. The bigger the better, right? If better means less effort to climb hills. But I have never seen a really big gear, like almost the circumference of the wheel. I assume that's for a practical reason, not just because it would be very lazy if it worked and look ridonkulous :)
