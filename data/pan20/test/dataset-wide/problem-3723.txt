Let $\bar{S}$ by the closure of S in $\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{R})$. If a polynomial with zero constant term is bounded on S, then its highest degree term vanishes on $S':=\bar{S} \setminus S \subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. In particular, if S' is Zariski dense in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ over Z, then B=Z (classically, sets with similar properties were called "generic"). On the other hand, S' could be defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ even when S is not (e.g. $y^2=\pi x$). Since obviously $B \neq \mathbb{Z}$ in the case in which $B \neq \mathbb{R}^n$ and B is defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, it would be interesting to find an irreducible S not defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ which is unbounded (i.e. $S' \neq \emptyset$) and for which $B \neq \mathbb{Z}$. 

I suspect that even if you had a single curve over $\mathbb{F}_p$, you might not find a lift to $\mathbb{Q}$. Below I sketch an argument that works under the assumption that $\mathcal{M}_g$ does not have Zariski dense set of points. If you believe the conjectures of Lang on rational points, this assumption should be satisfied as soon $\mathcal{M_g}$ is of general type, e.g. if $g \geq 24$. Lemma. Suppose that $g$ is an integer such that $\mathcal{M}_g(\mathbb{Q})$ is not Zariski dense in $\mathcal{M}_g$. Then for all sufficiently large primes $p$, there are smooth curves $C_p$ of genus $g$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$ that are not reductions of curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Proof. By assumption, the set $Z:=\overline{\mathcal{M}_g(\mathbb{Q})}$ is a proper closed subset of $\mathcal{M}_g$. In particular, the dimension of $Z$ is smaller than the dimension of $\mathcal{M}_g$. By the Lang-Weil estimates, the number of points of $\mathcal{M}_g$ modulo $p$ grows as a polynomial in $p$ of degree $\dim \mathcal{M}_g$, since $\mathcal{M}_g$ is irreducible modulo $p$. Similarly, the number of points of $Z$ modulo $p$ grows as a polynomial in $p$ of degree at most $\dim Z$ (the "at most" comes from the fact that $Z$ need not be geometrically integral). Thus, for sufficiently large $p$, there will be points of $\mathcal{M}_g(\mathbb{F}_p)$ that are not contained in $Z(\mathbb{F}_p)$. These points correspond to smooth curves of genus $g$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$ that are not reductions of curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, as required. 

Let $A$ be a set of at most $q+1$ points in the plane that are not collinear and let $\ell$ be a line in the plane such that $|A \cap \ell| \geq 3$; then $A$ cannot have property (). 

This is mostly a series of comments, but guided by the questions you asked. First of all, I will only talk about $X_n$, interpreting it as the space of non-zero complex polynomials $p$ of degree at most $n$ such that no root of $p$ lies on the unit circle, taken up to non-zero scaling. We may as well think of the polynomials as homogeneous of degree exactly $n$ in two variables, so that each point of $X_n$ defines a subset of $n$ points of the complex projective line $\mathbb{CP}^1$ (the set of roots of the polynomial) that is disjoint from the unit circle. Therefore, $X_n$ is certainly a non-empty open subset in the standard topology of the projective space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$, and therefore $X_n$ has (real) dimension $2n$. Observe that the unit circle disconnects $\mathbb{CP}^1$, and that the points of $X_n$ are likewise distributed into (at least) $n+1$ connected components, corresponding to how the $n$ points in $\mathbb{CP}^1$ are distributed with respect to the two halves obtained by removing the unit circle (recall that $\mathbb{CP}^1$ is topologically a two-dimensional sphere and that the unit circle can be identified with the equator of the sphere, so that, among the $n$ points we are talking about, there are some that are in one hemisphere and some that are in the other). On the other hand, a non-empty Zariski open subset of an irreducible algebraic variety is connected. Thus, as a subset of the space of homogenous polynomials of degree $n$, the space $X_n$ is certainly not a complex algebraic subvariety. But, we may decide to analyze further the space $X_n$, zooming in on the locus $X_n^k$ where, for a fixed integer $k$, there are $k$ points on the half containing the origin and $n-k$ points on other half. Clearly, within each hemisphere, the points are free to roam around! Thus $X_n^k$ is homeomorphic (and in fact diffeomorphic with the natural choice of differentiable structure) to the space of ordered pairs $(p_1,p_2)$ where $p_1$ is a monic polynomial of degree $k$ and $p_2$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n-k$: expand each hemisphere to a whole complex plane and "code" the $k$ points on one half by the unique monic polynomial having them as a root (and do the same to the other half). Thus each space $X_n^k$ is connected and in fact diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^k \times \mathbb{C}^{n-k}$. As a complex manifold you can also say that $X_n^k$ is the product of the symmetric product of $k$ copies of the unit disk with the symmetric product of $n-k$ copies of the unit disk. Thus, again using a structure induced from the ambient space of homogeneous polynomials, any complex algebraic subvariety of $X_n$ would be a complex algebraic subvariety of a symmetric product of unit disks: I think that this means that the only complex algebraic subvarieties of $X_n$ are the points. Finally, let me make a small stab at getting your hand on $X$, by mentioning one description of the "glueing" of $X_n$ inside $X_{n+1}$. From the point of view of non-homogeneous polynomials, this corresponds to simply realizing that a polynomial of degree at most $n$ is also a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$. From the point of view of their homogenizations, the inclusion corresponds to replacing $z^i$ by $x^iy^{n+1-i}$ instead of $x^iy^{n-i}$. Effectively, we are adding the point at infinity as one of our roots (namely the extra root $y=0$). Thus in terms of the description above, we observe that the two hemispheres are not "identical": one of them has a point that is special, namely the point at infinity. The points of $X_{n+1}$ that come from points of $X_n$ are the points that correspond to $(n+1)$-tuples one of whose elements is the point at infinity. 

To complement Hailong's answer, here is another way of seeing that an irreducible component of a Cohen-Macaulay scheme need not have special properties. In the example below, the whole scheme is Cohen-Macaulay, so all of its components have the same dimension, unlike in Hailong's example. Let $X$ be a reduced and irreducible subscheme of projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ of codimension $c$. Choose $c$ elements $f_1,\ldots,f_c$ in the ideal of $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ with the property that the vanishing set $X'$ of $f_1,\ldots,f_c$ is reduced and has codimension $c$. Thus the scheme $X'$ contains $X$ as a component, it is a complete intersection, and hence it is Cohen-Macaulay. On the other hand, $X$ was essentially arbitrary, so you could have chosen it to be not Cohen-Macaulay! For a more explicit example, let $X$ be a surface in $\mathbb{P}^4$ with a point that analytically locally looks like the union of two planes at a single point. (This is one of the standard example of a scheme that is not Cohen-Macaulay.) Choose two "general" elements of the ideal of $X$, and let $X'$ be the scheme defined by those two elements. Thus, $X'$ is Cohen-Macaulay and $X$ is a component of $X'$, but the surface $X$ it is not Cohen-Macaulay. EDIT As Hailong pointed out, I answered a question that is different than what was asked. To answer the initial question, it suffices to argue as above, choosing also a hypersurface $H$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ not containing $X$. Denote by $h$ an equation for $H$ and replace $f_1 , \ldots , f_c$ by $h f_1 , \ldots , h f_c$. The vanishing set $\overline{X}$ of these equations consists of the union of $H$ and the scheme $X'$ we had before. Thus $X$ is still a component of $\overline{X}$, of codimension $c$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$, the ideal of $\overline{X}$ is generated by $c$ equations, but the component $X$ is (essentially) arbitrary, in particular it need not be Cohen-Macaulay. This should now answer the question that was asked! 

(This should have been a comment to Andreas Blass' answer, but it did not fit there.) To answer the stronger question, asked in a comment to Andreas Blass' answer you can argue as follows in the case of a CW complex. Suppose that $X$ is a CW complex, that $X$ is not simply connected, and that for any point $x$ in $X$ the space $X \setminus \{x\}$ is contractible, then $X$ is a circle. If $X$ has cells in dimension at least three, then removing a point from the interior of such a cell does not change the 2-skeleton of the CW complex and hence does not affect the fundamental group (any homotopy between loops can be made to happen within the 2-skeleton). Since we are assuming that $X$ is not simply connected, but that the removal of any point makes the space contractible, it follows that $X$ cannot have cells of dimension three or more. Similarly, removing a point in the interior of a cell of dimension two corresponds to removing a relation for the fundamental group of $X$. Again, since we are assuming that $X$ is not simply connected, the resulting space would have fundamental group surjecting to a non-trivial group and would therefore not be trivial. Therefore we deduce that $X$ has no cells of dimension two either. We are left with $X$ having cells of dimension at most one. Thus $X$ is a wedge of circles and it is now easy to see that the stated condition implies that $X$ is in fact a single circle. With similar arguments it seems that you can show also the following result. Suppose that $X$ is a CW complex such that for every point $x \in X$ the space $X \setminus \{x\}$ is contractible. Then either $X$ is itself contractible (e.g. $S^\infty$), or $X$ is homotopy equivalent (and maybe even homeomorphic) to a sphere. 

Certainly not: even in the case of $X=Y=S=\mathbb{P}^1$ and the two maps $X,Y \to S$ are the same and general of degree at least three. In this case one component is the "diagonal" $\mathbb{P}^1$ and the remaining component is a curve of genus 1, I think. 

There are also standard examples in which both spaces are compact manifolds. For instance, if $n \geq 1$ is an integer and $Q_n \subset \mathbb{P}^{2n+2}$ is a non-singular quadric, then $Q_n$ has the same integral homology and cohomology groups as $\mathbb{P}^{2n+1}$, but the cohomology rings are different. 

The argument that I had is flawed and I do not know how to fix it. Here is a short description of one part that I cannot address. We are given two polarized K3 surfaces X and Y of degrees x and y respectively. It is clear that we can check if X and Y are isomorphic as polarized surfaces, but we would like to check if they are isomorphic as surfaces. If we could prove that there were finitely many polarizations on X having degree y and this finite set were computable, then we would be done. Unfortunately, there could be infinitely many such polarizations on X. For Abelian surfaces the situation is slightly better, since the number of polarisations with a given degree is finite (by a theorem of Narasimhan and Nori). To find the polarisations on an Abelian variety A, one possibility is to compute the orbits of the automorphism group of A on the Neron-Severi group of A. While this could be difficult over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, it might be replaced by a similar statement modulo a prime of good reduction, where at least Picard numbers can be computed by the Tate conjecture. Also in this case, I do not know if there are further problems with this approach. I believe that this kills completely my previous post! 

I will assume that d is the degree of the pull-back of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ to $\Sigma$ and that it is sufficiently large with respect to the genus g of $\Sigma$. In this case, the dimension of the space of holomorphic maps of $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is $$ D_n := (n+1)d + n(1-g) , $$ while the dimension of the space of holomorphic maps that are not isomorphisms onto their image is $$ (n+1)d + n(1-g) -n+2 = D_n -(n-2) . $$ In particular, since the inclusion that you are interested in has complement of (complex) codimension n-2, it follows that it is "quite connected", roughly (2n-1)-connected? Unless I made some mistakes in my computations, the estimates for the dimensions above are only valid if d is sufficiently large, otherwise they should simply be lower bounds on the actual dimensions of the spaces. In the case of n=2 you obviously must allow singularities in the image, but you can also prove that the locus where the morphism is not a local embedding (i.e. when the derivative is not injective somewhere) has codimension one. 

Let $A$ be a set of at most $q+1$ points in the plane having property (); then $A$ consists of all the points contained in a line. 

It seems to me that the characteristic of the field does not play a big role in this question: here is a sketch of an argument. Note first of all, that all the invariants are linear combinations of "symmetrized monomials": if m is a monomial in the polynomial ring, then form the sum of all the translates of m by the elements of your group. This means that every invariant in the polynomial ring comes from an invariant polynomial with coefficients in the prime field $\mathbb{F}_2$ of K and that invariants with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_2$ are the reduction of invariants with integer coefficients. Thus we have translated the question over characteristic two to a question over the integers: it suffices to find generators and relations for the ring of invariants of your group over the integers to find generators and relations in any ring. Over the integers I do not know what the answer is, but if you do know what the answer is over any field of characteristic different from two, maybe you can now fill in the argument. Thinking briefly about the set of generators, it seems like you might simply need the "symmetrized square-free monomials", with relations that are a bit tedious to write down, but that maybe can be nicely interpreted. EDIT: The square-free monomials are not enough, but it seems that you do not have to look much further to describe explicitly a finite set of generators for the group algebra of a finite cyclic group over the integers. Indeed, let S be the set of monomials m for which there exists an integer r such that the exponents of m are the integers $\{0,1,\ldots,r\}$. Then the product of all the variables of the polynomial ring together with the symmetrizations of all the monomials in S seems to generate the ring of invariants. "Symmetrize a monomial m" means sum over the cosets of the stabilizer in the cyclic group of m. I have not thought about relations, but there will be plenty! If you really need to make explicit the fact that the ring of invariants is not Cohen-Macaulay, maybe you can, but maybe you do not need to do that...
