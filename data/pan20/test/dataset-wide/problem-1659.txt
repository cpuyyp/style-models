HIV-1 group M was found before 1960 in Leopoldville/Kinshasa which was well before the start of Special Virus Cancer Program in 1964. 

Also with regards to your claim that "I look at the President for example, and he is 55 and he appears just as sharp as people in their 20s. And then my dad is 74 and is just as sharp with his working & long-term memory, and with learning new things - I can't notice that there is anything different with their cognitive abilities", its not surprising since recent research shows that cognitive performance is better in those born more recently. 

Badminton World Federation (BWF) the world governing body of the sport of badminton mentions in its shuttlecock manufacturing certification standards that the shuttlecock should have 16 feathers fixed in the base but nowhere it mentions that it should be from the right or left wing of the goose or duck. 

TL;DR: Shave results tend to be affected by preshave, during-shave and post-shave techniques. Post-shaving moisturizers containing specific ingredients help in smoothing skin, reduction of underlying tissue damage and damaged skin barrier repair. 

Referring to Pavitra Rastogi in 2011, systematic studies and randomized control trials are needed to find out the best probiotic strains and means of administration in different oral health conditions. 

According to American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness, strength training with proper technique and strict/appropriate supervision can increase strength in preadolescents and adolescents. However, it should be also noted that gains in strength, muscle size, or power are lost close to 6 weeks after resistance training is discontinued. Appropriate strength-training programs with proper technique and strict supervision have no apparent adverse effect on linear growth, growth plates, or the cardiovascular system. Caution should be exercised for youngsters with preexisting hypertension, youngsters who have received chemotherapy with anthracyclines due to increased risk for cardiac problems because of the cardiotoxic effects of the medications and youngsters having seizure disorders. These susceptible populations would require medical clearance before starting resistance training. Preadolescents and adolescents should avoid power lifting, body building, and maximal lifts until they reach physical and skeletal maturity. Strength programs are recommended not to start before balance and postural control skills maturity to adult levels by 7 to 8 years of age. Preadolescents and adolescent should also completely avoid performance-enhancing substances or anabolic steroids for exercising. 

Updated aluminum pharmacokinetics following infant exposures through diet and vaccination. The CDC gives 1.0 mg/kg/day as the Minimal Risk Levels for aluminum. Aluminum in vaccines in particular has been found to pose extremely low risk to infants. 

The link to the source of their data is dead, but it seems likely that 1 in 3.6 billion odds are lower than a whole lot of very unlikely causes of death (struck by lightning while drowning: 1 in 183 million). 

I was listening a discussion on poverty on CSPAN radio this morning and Robert E. Rector from The Heritage Foundation claimed that 25% of the Earned Income tax credit is fraudulent. Specifically, the claim was that 25% of the money goes to people who misreport their income or people who don't have the "relevant child in their home" (I'm guessing divorced parents claiming dependents on their taxes that live with the other parent). Is there any evidence that 25% of the EITC is payed improperly? Edit: Link to the program, the claim is made around 21:30 

A lot of reputable news media outlets base those estimate on this site: $URL$ So it appears that the cost of the program was around $314 million, 20 bombs were delivered to the military thus the unit cost was ~ $16 million. It's not unusual for the first unit to have very high cost because of large capital investment (research, design, machines, etc) but the variable cost (how much it costs for materials & labor to build a bomb once you have all the facilities) to be fairly low. So the first bomb might be $200 million, the next 19 another 120 million, thus the average unit cost is $16 million and total program expenditure $320 million. If they build a 1000 more, the unit cost will probably go down. 

So the reported did not create the precedent, the court did in Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania 

Electric cars also don't have differentials or a drive shaft. Instead, each wheel that's powered gets its own motor and torque is controlled by electronics. That's called "electronic differential". Here is how Wikipedia describes them: 

The Washington Post fact checked this claim and scored in 2 (of 4) Pinocchios. While it's true that the number of Syrian Christian refugees admitted to the US is disproportionately lower, it's not clear why. The WP article lists the number of Syrian refugee for 2016 by religion as: 

Per cancer.org, "The measurement of cell phone use in most studies has been crude. Most have been case-control studies, which have relied on people’s memories about their past cell phone use. In these types of studies, it can be hard to interpret any possible link between cancer and an exposure. People with cancer are often looking for a possible reason for it, so they may sometimes (even subconsciously) recall their phone usage differently than people without cancer. With these limitations in mind, it is important that the possible risk of cell phone exposure continue to be researched using strong study methods, especially with regard to use by children and longer-term use." A case-control study is a type of observational study design in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. Case-control studies are often used to identify factors that may contribute to a medical condition by comparing subjects who have that condition/disease (the "cases") with patients who do not have the condition/disease but are otherwise similar (the "controls"). They require fewer resources but provide less evidence for causal inference than a randomized controlled trial since subjects are not randomized to the exposed or unexposed groups. Rather the subjects are observed in order to determine both their exposure and their outcome status and the results may be confounded by other factors, to the extent of giving the opposite answer to better studies. Randomized double blind placebo control (RDBPC) studies are considered the “gold standard” of epidemiologic studies since when they are well designed, they provide the strongest possible evidence of causation. Per Joel M. Moskowitz, epidemiologic research does not yield conclusive evidence and the quality of the epidemiologic research has been problematic on which one cannot draw causal inferences from case-control studies. Numerous studies published so far have not found a link between cell phone use and the development of tumors. Also, three large studies such as the 13-country INTERPHONE study (the study found no link between brain tumor risk and the frequency of calls, longer call time, or cell phone use for 10 or more years), the Danish cohort study (Cell phone use, even for more than 13 years, was not linked with an increased risk of brain tumors, salivary gland tumors, or cancer overall, nor was there a link with any brain tumor subtypes or with tumors in any location within the brain), and The Million Women Study (found no link between cell phone use and brain tumors overall or several common brain tumor subtypes, but it did find a possible link between long-term cell phone use and acoustic neuromas) have had some important limitations that make them unlikely to end the controversy about whether cell phone use affects cancer risk. Another study in 2011 shows doubling of the risk of head tumours induced by long-term mobile phone use or latency. 

I traced the graph to this paper by Hsiang-Wen Hsu and Hsiang-Wen Hsua at University of Colorado Boulder. It was published in 2012 in American Journal of Physics. The paper is behind a paywall so I can not link to it, but I read it and it appears correct. The authors watched video from the Apollo Moon walks looking for certain frames in which dust was kicked up by the buggy. Using those frames they measured how high and how far the dust went - that's the blue squares on the plot. This is possible because they know the frame rate and resolution of the video footage. Using the wheel of the rover as an yard stick (16 inch wheel), they can convert pixel sized to meters. Time is also know from the frame rate. Using ballistic motion equations and accounting for linear drag they calculated 4 trajectories - 2 with Earth gravity (green dashed lines), 1 dust trajectory from the data they extracted from the video and 1 expected Moon trajectory using the actual moon gravitational constant. Here is the paper's summary: 

Yes those numbers appear to be correct. The Cato instituted published "Terrorism and Immigration A Risk Analysis" in September 2016. From that report: 

In US popular culture, it's often asserted that white people are more prone to commit certain types of crime that are "crazy", such as serial murder, child abduction, mass shooting, etc. This is often portrayed in movies, the most recent example being "Get Out" (which I saw last night): Here is a quote from the movie: 

No. WP fact checked this and scored it 3 pinocchios WP did reach out to Cruz's staff for clarification on what does the senator consider "pork". Here is what they were told and their analysis on it: 

That definition was given in the 2004 rules for Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the definition used by some US courts (more info) More traditionally a combatant is someone taking part directly in an armed conflict. It seems very unlikely that any male over 15 would automatically be considered a combatant purely based on their sex and age. The claim seems to suggest that to be the case even when civilian targets were hit. This would violate a number of US and international laws and there are no evidence to that effect. 

You can search the bill yourself for those amounts (that add up to well over 1/3 of the total $50 billion the bill allocated by the way) and read the details for yourself, but it appears that the funding is mostly disaster relief related.
