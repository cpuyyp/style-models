To know that something is true means to know that something is the case. For example if one makes the statement p, ‘The sun rises in the east’, and you want to find out if p is true, you need to go out there and observe the rising or not rising of the sun in the east. If the sun rises in the east, as has been the case for us humans for thousands of years, then we say that p is true. This is called inductive reasoning, which has served us very well and allowed us to make magnificent technological progress. You don’t need to know what ‘truth’ is. Truth is just another way of saying that something is the case for a particular object or event in a specific time and place. In other words, Truth is not a Platonic idea to which all things partake in order to obtain the property of trueness. This means that truth is not absolute but relative to the perspective we take. Outside our specific perspective the notion of truth does not make any sense. For example, if you live on a space station and make the statement p, ‘The sun rises in the east”, then p is meaningless. In space there are no cardinal points, or up, down, left, right. All these orientations make sense and can have a true/false value only if we decide to adopt a point of reference, to which these orientations will be relative. In addition, we assume that the laws of nature are true everywhere in the universe. We make assumptions in order to work on our theories to build models that would explain the world. And know very well that progress is made only when our models are falsified. In which case we are forced to change our assumptions (what we held as true) about the world and proceed to build new models on the basis of the newly acquired knowledge. To know that p means that we take p to be true, until evidence proves otherwise. This is how knowledge progresses, by revising our beliefs or what we hold as true for a particular object or event. 

No, you don’t need to know what truth is before you decide that something is true or not. The way we use the concept of truth is with a predicate, i.e. truth is with reference to the subject of a proposition, and all we need is the verification of our senses. For example, if you want to know that a certain cat (e.g. Schrödinger’s cat) sealed in a box is dead or alive, all you have to do is open the box. If you do open the box and find that the cat is dead, then your earlier statement (if you made one), p = The cat is dead, is true, else, according to Quantum Physics, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time (in Nagarjuna’s tetralemma: p AND ~p is the case just before you open the box, which does away with Aristotle’s principle of non-contradiction (law of the excluded middle, i.e. either a proposition is true or its negation is true.) In Mathematics we have no need for the verification of our sense, but we must follow a series of steps (rules, laws, procedures) determined by logic and, sometimes, by intuition. Platonists on the other hand believe that there is such a thing as Truth, an Ideal Form, which has little to do with the truths revealed by our senses but is like the truth revealed by mathematics. The same applies also to other concepts, e.g. Justice, Freedom, Good, Evil, etc. But this idea has no practical value in a mundane world. Nietzsche said that all such terms (those above) are governed by conventions and we must not forget that they are metaphors, metonymies, etc.: “What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.” (Nietzsche: On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense). For Nietzsche, and for a lot of other people, “Truth … the ‘thing in itself’ (for that is what pure truth, without consequences, would be) is quite incomprehensible to the creators of language and not at all worth aiming for.” (Nietzsche: On Truth and ...etc.) 

Helpful links: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ In most cases you will get enough time to think well before speaking out an unpleasant truth. And you will be able to do it in another way without speaking the truth. This means silence is a good policy in many cases. I believe that you know about great social reformers. Many of them didn't speak the truth directly at improper time. Instead, they acted differently. In the Mahabharatha while Droupati was insulted, King Dhrutharashtra and Bheeshma remained silent. And in the end they lost almost all they had. So when we are among wicked people, we must be very cautious while remaining silent as well as speaking out the truth. Some of our words can thwart somebody's wicked plan completely. Sometimes we will have to do a little Adharma in order to save/reestablish a great Dharma. So, as a part of this, we will be compelled to tell little lies very rarely. You may have read it in the Mahabharata. Very great men have transfused many things (including truth) in silence. Ordinary people like us can't do this often. 

All living things are Earth's parasites. But the question is what we can give in return for the wellbeing of coming generations. Humans are the only living being that can find the value of each thing in terms of money. You will find some useful information in Indian Philosophy. For e.g. see this: Science is developing amazingly and it seems it is for each human to stand on his own feet ignoring the basics of ecology. Material pleasire would be for a short period only. Actually day by day we are becoming a mere thinking animal. Ego, if it has developed as a complex, it will create problems. Too much of anything is bad. Human life has aims; considering him as an animal and as a being that has the highest potentiality. If people were aware of their own Dharma and had lived accordingly, many problems we are facing now could have been eliminated. These descriptions are just for the enrichment of your ideas. You will certainly find valuable information in Indian philosophy as well as in other philosophies. The basis of creation is described in Bhagavad Gita: See Chapter 3.10 Try to know about Tri Rinas (Deva Rina, Pitru Rina and Rishi Rina) $URL$ Many ancient scripts in India known as Puranas, have great significance in our daily life. [The word 'Purana' is derived from 'purana' meaning ancient and 'nava' meaning new. That implies the things (way of life) mentioned in them is applicable now also.] So 

We actually don't think so, because it doesn't make sense. Because of that, some of the greatest theologians such Saint Thomas Aquinas, Avicenna, and others, building on top of Aristotle's work, came to the conclusion that God must be a transcendental being: a being that transcends time and space and that is therefore not bound to such, which means the notion of precedence does not apply to Him. That's why God is called a necessary being: it is not contingent on anything causing (creating) it, so it is called a necessary (as opposed to contingent) being. Other religions, even polytheistic religions, came to the same conclusion as well (Avicenna was muslim). Another way of putting it is simply: it doesn't make sense to think about something coming out of nothing -- everything must have a cause -- or about infinite causal chains; therefore, there must be a first from which our universe and, therefore, time and space, came to be; a cause that was itself not caused, meaning created, by anything else. This first cause is what we call God. The most clear while concise explanation I have seen is in a book called Apologetic, by Rev. Paul Glenn. You can also find these arguments here $URL$ Please not that Aquinas didn't claimed he had proved the existence of God, which he deemed an unknowable being. Instead, this type of argument should be taken as making a reasonable case that can be made for the existence of God as the creator of everything. Kant claimed that reason tends to extrapolates its domain, which is limited by our possible experiences, and that any extrapolation is subjected to (at best) the possibility of being completely off, in which case we cannot answer the question "where did everything come from," but we all know that it can't have been from nothing. 

it looks to me that you are trying to object to arguments such as the ones given by User26328 and by RodolfoAP, namely that the fact that you ask questions makes you not a dog, since asking questions is not part of "dogness." However, it is important to notice that brains do not think as people as a whole do. Because asking "why?," thinking about meaning and making judgments are not simply emotions that can be explained by neuroscience since those cannot be encoded in physical media. The fact that you are asking this question, therefore, means that you have more than just a brain: it means that you have a soul, which is one of the traits that defines us human. 

When we rely upon our sense organs and intellect for perception and comprehension we can say so. But when the Inner Eye opens, the truth will be revealed. Please read these comments on Reincarnation. 

Anything which is 'physical' it will exist for a certain period and perish eventually. So there is nothing physical which is not impermanent...(means permanent). But you can find a permanent thing that helps you to know even about physical things. It is the Chaitanya (consciousness). See this: $URL$ 

$URL$ If the aforementioned is difficult to digest, the following mantra would be useful in our daily life. Isavasyam idam sarvam yat kim ca jagatyam jagat 

Prayer should be for uplifting (the person, persons, society, .... the whole world etc.) from a 'lower level' to a 'higher'. If one can do this without praying, that is enough. But that person must be a 'real seeker' in all its aspects. Many men who realized the Ultimate truth were not 'believers in God' at their younger days. 

I don't think that even all educated people are concerned with the origin of their creation. But some people are. When we are awake our mind always wander here and there to fulfill something without knowing what it actually is. All the materials we get can satisfy us up to a limited period only. But the wandering continues without an end because with the help of present elements/factors the nature can create/is creating myriads of combinations. This wandering will stop only by the knowledge of our self. Great men who realized it said so and the new generation follows them. Those who tried to test it no longer didn't need to ask a counter question...because they were FULLY SATISFIED with it. This truth is deeply rooted in us also. 

According to Indian Philosophy it has already been said. Please refer what is said at the beginning of the Mahabharata. 

I haven't studied Nietzsche's philosophy. So, the only thing I can do here is to verify this only statement. We often say--"I asked myself." And this is never considered to be nonsense. Here, 'myself' must mean something other than 'I'. Then only this statement would become meaningful. So, 'myself' is the 'me' that represents my SELF. In our daily conversation, this must be related to our intellect. And the 'I' (in this case) must be something related to our mind because it has a wavering tendency. If the above statement has got any meaning, 'me' must be something purer and subtler than 'I'. That may be the reason for his statement: "I and me are always too deep in conversation." I don't know whether Nietzsche knew about the following thought.
