Let $R$ be a local ring, $m$ its maximal ideal and $k:= R/m$ its residue field. Suppose that a finite cyclic group $G= \mathbb{Z}/ m \mathbb{Z}$ has a linear nontrivial action on $R$. Let $R^G$ be a ring of invariant elements of $R$ by this action. Let $E:= E_R(k)$ be an injective hull of $k$ Question 1 Is $G$ naturally acts on $E$? Question 2 Is $E$ injective hull of $k$ as a $R^G$-module? Actually I'm thinking the case where $R$ is the local ring of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(f=0)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and $f$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_m$-eigenfunction. 

Let $LR(\mu/\lambda;\nu)$ be the set of Littlewood-Richardson tableaux of shape $\mu/\lambda$ and weight $\nu$. Then there is a canonical bijection between $LR(\mu/\lambda;\nu)$ and $LR(\mu/\nu;\lambda)$, presented in a paper by Pak and Vallejo ("Fundamental Symmetry map"), in a paper by Danilov and Koshevoi ("Commutor"), and in a paper by Henriques and Kamnitz. Is this what you want ? In the paper by Pak and Vallejo actually two "Fundamental Symmetry maps" are presented. Danilov and Koshevoi show that they coincide, and that they coincide with their "commutor", and with the map defined by Henriques and Kamnitzer. The references: Igor Pak and Ernesto Vallejo.

Let $X = (f=0) \subset \mathbb{C}^3$ be an isolated hypersurface singularity and $\mu: \tilde{X} \rightarrow X$ be a resolution of a singularity whose exceptional locus $E$ is simple normal crossing. Then Question Is $H^1(\tilde{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{X}}(- E)) =0$ ? I think it's OK if it is Du Bois. How about in general? 

Let $S$ be a smooth projective surface over $\mathbb{C}$ and $L$ be an ample line bundle on $S$. Let $d$ be a positive integer such that $dL$ is very ample and $D$ a very general member of the linear system $|dL|$. Let $T_D \rightarrow S$ be the degree $d$ cyclic cover branched along $D$. Assume that the Picard number $ \rho(S) =1 $. Q.(Edited) Is the picard number $\rho(T_D)$ $1$ for a sufficiently large integer $d$? 

About your first question: remark that when $m=n$ these matrices are sometimes called "semi-magic squares" (like "magic squares" but without the "sums along the diagonals" condition). About the constructions of families of such matrices, there is another paper by Brualdi: R.A. Brualdi, Algorithms for constructing (0, 1)-matrices with prescribed row and column sum vectors, Discrete Math. 306 (2006), no. 23, 3054-3062. You can see also this paper by Fonseca and Mamede on the same subject: $URL$ Here the construction is related to other combinatorial objects (pairs of semi-standard Young tableaux of conjugate shapes), as you wished. 

Let $V, \tilde{V}$ be smooth algebraic varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and $f \colon \tilde{V} \rightarrow V$ a projective (or proper) birational morphism. Assume that the exceptional locus $E \subset \tilde{V}$ has codimension $\ge 2$. Question Is $f$ an isomorphism? 

Let $C$ be an effective Cartier divisor on a smooth projective surface $S$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. Assume that $C$ has a reduced irreducible component $C_1$ (even though $C$ may not be reduced) and assume that $h^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C) =1$.(Edited) Let $x_1 \in C_1$ be a closed point on the smooth part $C_1^0$ of $C_1$. Question (1) Is it possible to define $a \colon C_1^0 \rightarrow {\rm Pic}^0 C ; x \mapsto \mathcal{O}_C(x-x_1)$? (2) If so, is $a$ a non-constant morphism? 

The evaluation of the Schur function $s_{\lambda}$ at the $n$th-roots of unity is the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}$ in the expansion in the Schur basis of the plethysm $h_k[p_n]=p_n[h_k]$ of the complete sum $h_k$ with the power sum $p_n$, when $k\cdot n=|\lambda|$ (and $0$ if $|\lambda|$ is not a multiple of $n$). Indeed, consider the Cauchy identity, $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-x_i y_j}=\sum_{\lambda} s_{\lambda}[X] s_{\lambda}[Y]. $$ Take for the $x_i$ the $n$th-roots of unity $\zeta_i$. Therefore the evaluation of $s_{\lambda}$ that you are looking for will be the coefficient of $s_{\lambda}[Y]$ in the expansion in the Schur basis of $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-\zeta_i y_j}. $$ On the other hand, $$ \prod_{i,j} \frac{1}{1-\zeta_i y_j}=\prod_{j}\frac{1}{1-y_j^n}. $$ This is the generating series for the complete sums $h_k$ evaluated at $y_1^n$, $y_2^n\ldots$ , that are exactly the plethysms $h_k[p_n]$: $$ \prod_{j}\frac{1}{1-y_j^n}=\sum_k h_k[p_n[Y]]. $$ These plethysms expand in the Schur basis: $$ h_k[p_n[Y]]=\sum_{\lambda} d(\lambda,(k),n) s_{\lambda}[Y].$$ The coefficient $d(\lambda,(k),n)$ is the evaluation you are looking for, for $k \cdot n = |\lambda|$. For any particular computation of the $d(\lambda,(k),n)$ you may use SAGE or John Stembridge's SF package for Maple. For a general study, you should find at least some examples of such plethysms in Macdonald's classical book. You will find more recent results by googling "plethysms power sums complete sums in Schur", for instance by William Doran, or Carbonara+Remmel+Yang. EDIT: Actually it is easy to evaluate the Schur polynomials at the $n$-the roots of unity, from the definition of the Schur polynomials as "bialternants". One gets that the evaluation of the Schur polynomial is nonzero if and only if the classes modulo $n$ of $\lambda_n$, $\lambda_{n-1}+1, \ldots, \lambda_1+{n-1}$ are a permutation of the classes of $0,1,\ldots,n-1$. Then this evaluation is the sign of the permutation. About the evaluation of the monomial functions, since this is what you are really interested in. A method for evaluating the monomial functions at the roots of unity is presented in Alain Lascoux and Marcel-Paul Schutzenberger's "Formulaire raisonné de fonctions symétriques", ex. 5.14, with a reference to a paper of 1881 by E. West. I think it generalizes indeed your computations by inclusion-exclusion. The method consists in expanding the monomial functions in the power sum basis. Note that the power sum $p_r$ at the $n$-th roots of unity is $n$ if $n$ divides $k$, and $0$ else. The expansion of monomial functions in the power sum basis is explained in Example 2.7 of the "Formulaire raisonné de fonctions symétriques". It is also explained in "On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory. VII: Symmetric Functions through the theory of distribution and occupancy". Peter Doubilet. Studies in Applied Mathematics 51 (4), 1972. Say you want to expand $m_{(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)}$ in the power sum basis. Consider rather the "augmented monomial function" (which is, by the way, the function you are really interested in): $$ M_{(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)}=\sum x_{i_1}^{\lambda_1} x_{i_2}^{\lambda_2} \cdots x_{i_k}^{\lambda_k} $$ where the sum is carried over all arrangements $x_{i_1},x_{i_2},\ldots,x_{i_k}$ of $k$ variables. The expansion of $M_{\lambda}$ in the power sum basis involves the set partitions $\Pi$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. They form a lattice under refinement, whose smallest element is the partition $\hat{0}$ in $k$ singletons. This lattice admits a Möbius function. Let $B_1$, $B_2,\ldots,B_{\ell}$ be the blocks of $\Pi$. The Möbius function on the interval $[\hat{0},\Pi]$ is: $$ \mu(\hat{0},\Pi)=(-1)^{k-\ell} \prod_i \left( \text{card} B_i -1\right)! $$ Set $\lambda(\Pi)$ for the partition whose parts are the $\sum_{i \in B} \lambda_i$ for $B$ block of $\Pi$. Then the formula is: $$ M_{\lambda}=\sum_{\Pi} \mu([\hat{0},\Pi]) p_{\lambda(\Pi)} $$ where the sum is over all set partitions $\Pi$ of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. When evaluating at the $n$-th roots of unity you obtain: $$ \sum_{\Pi} \mu([\hat{0},\Pi]) n^{\ell(\Pi)} $$ where the sum is over all partitions $\Pi$ such that all parts of $\lambda(\Pi)$ are multiple of $n$, and $\ell(\Pi)$ is the number of blocks. 

Let $x \in U$ be a germ of a $3$-dimensional terminal quotient singularity of type $\frac{1}{r} (1,a,r-a)$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $D \in |-K_U|$ be an anticanonical divisor. Assume that $D$ is normal and singular at $x$. Let $\mu: \tilde{U} \rightarrow (U,D)$ be a log resolution such that $\mu$ is isomorphism outside $x$. Question Is $H^1(\tilde{D}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{D}}(-\tilde{D}) =0$? It seems that $H^1(\tilde{U}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{U}}(-\tilde{D}))=0$. If $H^2(\tilde{U}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{U}}(-2\tilde{D})) =0$, the statement in the Question seems to be true. Is there a counterexample? 

To establish that $U_k \cap U_{k+1} \subset W_{n-k+1}$: Consider the polynomial $P(t)=\prod (t-x_i)$. The elementary symmetric polynomials $\sigma_i$ are its coefficients, up to the sign. Suppose that $\sigma_k=\sigma_{k+1}=0$. This means that $0$ is a multiple root of the derivative of order $(n-k-1)$ of $P$. Now you can conclude that $0$ is a root of $P$ of multiplicity at least $n-k+1$ (that is: at least $n-k+1$ of the numbers $x_i$ are zero) by means of the following facts: 

Put $V= \mathbb{C}^3$. Let $D \subset V$ be an isolated singularity and $\mu: \tilde{V} \rightarrow V$ be a log resolution of the pair $(V,D)$ whose exceptional locus $E$ and the strict transform $\tilde{D}$ satisfies that $\tilde{D} \cup E$ has a normal crossing support. We can define $c_j \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $K_{\tilde{V}} + \tilde{D}　= \mu^* (K_V +D)+ \sum c_j E_j $ where $E = \bigcup E_j$ is the irreducible decomposition. Question Is there $\mu$ such that $c_j \le 0$ for all $j$? 

It is unlikely to obtain for such a determinant the sum of all Schur functions indexed by partitions of $2n$ with four parts all even or all odd. Indeed, this sum is already equal to the inner product $s_{n,n}\ast s_{n,n}$ (see arXiv:0809.3469). About your second question: you can compute the inner product of symmetric functions in SAGE using the "kronecker_product" command. For instance, compute the inner product of Schur functions $s_{6,2}\ast s_{5,3}$ as follows: s=SymmetricFunctionAlgebra(QQ,basis='schur') s([6,2]).kronecker_product(s([5,3])) You may also use Maple with John Stembridge's package SF and the command "itensor".
