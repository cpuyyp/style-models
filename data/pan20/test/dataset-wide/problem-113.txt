There's only so much water you can push through a canal before it overflows. Overflowing a canal means washing out the farm and killing the farmer and his chickens, so overflowing the canal (e.g., too much current in a wire, damaging the wire with heat) is bad. Paddle wheels are useful for doing work. Some paddlewheels are light duty, they turn a small fan to keep the chickens cool. It almost doesn't matter how much water there is because the paddle wheel is light and easy to turn. What really matters is the water's speed (voltage). Too little speed and the wheel doesn't turn and the chickens die of heat stroke. Too much speed and the grease on the axel burns away, breaking the paddle wheel (killing both the chickens and the little orphan boy who was collecting eggs). You need the correct speed to turn the wheel efficiently. A large paddle wheel, however, needs both speed and volume. The farm's large wheel is used to turn the grinding stone for flour and, by shifting gears, runs a really neat tool that punches, drills, saws, and hammers for quick wood and metal manufacture. Like the light wheel, there needs to be the proper speed to turn the wheel, but you also need volume or the wheel just sits there getting wet. In real life, a circuit will only use as much current as it needs, but too little voltage and the circuit fails to operate or too much voltage and the circuit burns up. See my real-life example, above. Gearing (called a transformer in the world of electricity) allows us to compensate for what kind of water source we have. We have a big canal the entire community has access to but we want to run a light wheel at a higher speed than the large but slow moving canal can provide. So we use gears to speed the little wheel up. HOWEVER there's only so much you can do with a small but fast moving canal. Anyone who's used a garden hose to clean their driveway knows a little water at high pressure will move the dirt, often better than a lot of water at low pressure --- but you can't move a large rock that way. You need a lot of water to displace a rock. The same is basically true for electricity. 

That's it. Remember, you're dealing with a computer and an imager. No matter what people tell you, you can make bone structure and everything else look to be someplace completely different just using makeup. And if the software is using pupil location to justify "eye separation" then it could be fooled with contact lenses that adjust the "location" of the pupil. It it's using eyesocket or open-eye imaging, then you're back to fooling it with makeup. You might look a bit funny to a human, but the computer would be completely fooled. Anybody who tells you differently is trying to sell you the system. So, why don't people do this to fool the systems all the time? Because for nearly nine billion of us, it simply doesn't matter, and so we don't care. That works in the favor of people running the software. If half the people in a city starting acting to intentionally foil such systems (wearing hats, growing beards, wearing sunglasses, sticking cotton balls under your lips...) the usefulness of the software would drop to almost zero. 

I regret the answer is no. I don't know where you heard about the energy thing, but it suggests the speaker had little understanding of what science believes are the higher dimensions. Science Fiction, alternate realities, and new age thought have all unintentionally conspired to suggest that higher dimensions are someplace we can "be." You must remember that a dimension is a "dimension of measurement." It is assumed (because science has declared it to be so, and it's not an unreasonable assumption) that time is the 4th dimension. Thus, if you think of a patch of ground as the 2nd dimension, a building constructed on that ground as the 3rd dimension, then the decay of the building and it's possible replacement over time is the 4th dimension. To get an idea of what science thinks about multiple dimensions, view this youtube video (allow me to apologize for the narrator in advance). It's worth noting that, perceptively, our understanding of dimensions suggests that you can always look (observe) "down" into the lower dimensions, but cannot look (observe) "up" into the higher dimensions. You certainly can't exist in lower dimensions, QED, you can't exist in higher dimensions, either, other than to experience it one-piece-at-a-time (e.g., second-by-second, you can't "enter" the 4th dimension such that you can "observe" time as you would "observe" a landscape). You might want to consider parallel universes. Scientists are investigating a spot in our universe that might represent the collision between two such universes. If this proves to be true, then it would be theoretically possible to move between them. 

Hey, Talos! There must be something about your phone's browser that's getting in the way of the registration process. I seriously suggest connecting with a friend with a laptop and using it to create an account. I'm even going to suggest that you hold off more questions until you get this done. There's simply too many! Once you have an account, you can post to the SE folks and give them a list of your previous monikers and they can round it all up and stuff it into the new account. 

You are in luck. An experiment to better understand the domestication process was conducted on the Russian Red Fox. The project lead explained: 

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has weather satellites that blanket every square inch of the planet. Even assuming the military doesn't (hah!), NOAA would discover the blemish (4 million people!) very quickly. Remember, Antarctica is the litmus test for many global weather predictors (like global warming) because (a) it's cold and (b) it's untouched. 

Before I begin to specifically address your questions, let me point out that the scientist's metaphor is only partially right. An ant is certainly intellecutally incapable of understand what we humans do, but they are also so small that they literally cannot comprehend the world around them. A house is so large that they cannot perceive it as a structure. How do you comprehend a planet when the only things you can see are the grains of sand in front of you? We don't have that problem (at least I hope we don't!). The metaphor only works on an intellectual level. If there are advanced species in the universe, it's "reasonable" to assume that theire physical stature is commensurate with our own, that they are not so large or so small that we literally cannot comprehend the perception of their houses. We can see and comprehend a planet, after all, so it's difficult to imagine a house so large we can't understand what it is (or, at least, that it's a structure to contain something). Simply put, comprehension of physical size has nothing to do with technology. Ants are no more capable of understanding cavemen than they are humans today. A better metaphor would be whether or not a World War II radio man could detect someone using a modern cell phone? He certainly comprehends the nature of his search for signals such that, given the right equipment, he could succeed. But he doesn't have the technological background to create that equipment for himself --- it must be given to him. Therefore... (1) Yes, it is theoretically possible that even in our own solar system someone may exist such that we don't have the technological capacity to detect them at the interplanetary or intragalactic distances involved. Although our ability to "see" our sister planets is getting good enough that the ability to hide an alien "house" is getting harder, it's still possible to hide. (2) For one thing, our alien neighbors may not be using electromagnetic communications. Or, if they are, they're using frequencies well beyond our ability to discern. We're just beginning to use terahertz frequencies, so what if our neighbors are using petahertz or even exahertz frequencies? And, as I mentioned, what if they're not using electromagnetics at all? Modulated gravity waves would be uber-cool, but we're just beginning to detect the waves, much less a modulated wave. The real question is how they would hide themselves from visible light spectrums. But, the further distant they are, the easier it is to simply "hide in plain sight." Nevermind reflective cloaking tech that we're only beginning to investigate. (3) I cannot answer this as it is purely speculation. To the best of my knowledge, we have no actual example of anyone that has "evolved" beyond a physical manifestation. (4) I can't answer this one, either. We have no examples of a "micro" intelligence that is symbiotic with a "macro" intelligence. 

If I use the strict definition of "elf," then the answer must be no. Like humans, elves have ears on the sides of the head and the ears themselves are splayed out along the skull to capture sound in a hemispherical fashion. This gives us a tremendous advantage when it comes to triangulating sound from any source around us. However, our hearing is substantially weaker than creatures with cone-shaped ears. Animals (like cats) with cone-shaped ears hear sound basically from only one direction: the direction the ears are pointing — but the cone shape captures sound better. Most such animals can rotate the ears to track sound, compensating somewhat for the lack of 360-degree tracking, but it's a much slower and less accurate process. Remember that the shape of an elf's ear — the traditional pointy-eared elf — wouldn't actually give them improved hearing. The extra flesh is just that, extra flesh. We can stretch our ears today into marvelous shapes and it does nothing to our hearing. Further, when you say "rotate" you must realize that so long as the ear isn't cone-shaped, there's nowhere for the rotation to go. BUT... Let's assume elves had superior ear-wiggling muscle control such that they could pull the flesh behind the ear hole forward, turning the ear into a rudimentary cone-shaped ear akin to cupping your hands behind your ears. That would shift the ear from "tracking mode" to "sensitive mode," allowing them to hear better in the direction their nose was pointing. That's actually an interesting idea. 

On the hemisphere where the impact occured you'd have a whomping big hole surrounded first by a ring of mountains and then scattered debris. After the water filled back in, you'd have a massive ocean surrounded by an archipelago ring of mountains. Beyond that you'd have islands everywhere. On the exact opposite side of the Earth from the impact, the land would have been raised due to the force of the impact traveling through the earth. Given the size of the impact we're talking about, I'd assume a small continent would appear (if in ocean) or a thousand-or-more mile wide bluff would appear if on land with an escaprment surrounding it. It's more complicated than what I'm about to suggest, but think of what it would look like to stretch out a piece of rubber and then press your fist to the middle. That "raised land" is kinda what we're talking about. As for the rest of the opposite-hemisphere continents. Well, they'll be affected, but not to the extent your'e proposing. I wonder if the water draining into the impact crater wouldn't lower the ocean overall, leaving basically one fairly big continent on the opposite side. 

Ignoring the hard math, if you have low atmosphere, you need more thrust and/or wing area. However, adding wing area and/or thrust often means adding weight. The engine is heavy. The wings and infrastructure are heavy. Fuel is really heavy. So there's only so much you can do to overcome low atmosphere. World record altitude holders for powered flight include 300,000+ feet for the X-15 and SpaceShipOne rocket-powered air craft, 100,000+ feet for the F-104 and similar jet fighter/bombers, 85,000 feet for the SR-71 Blackbird, and 60,000 feet for the highest flying propeller-driven bird. But you're starting with 1/3 the air pressure at "sea level." Air pressure decreases exponentially. Consequently, dropping the pressure by 2/3 at "sea level" means dropping the maximum altitudes by more than 2/3. This is a honking' rough estimate, but let's cut all those records by 75%: 

Original Answer A massive problem is that it's difficult for an empire to grow without the ability to hold regional administrators accountable for their actions. Rome had this problem for a number of reasons including slow transport, slow communication, poor logistics, and (thanks to the Caesars) growing greed for personal power. Consider this map of the Roman Empire at its greatest extent. It covers a pitiful fraction of the land you're proposing. So, your question is, what would have to change to let that empire grow by, what, 200,000%? The closest we've every come (the British Empire) was 22% or so of the planet - and that was with late 1700 early 1800 technology amidst a world that was 1500-1600 technology. As the world acquired the benefits of the empire, their desire to be a part of it waned. I'm going to assume that I can't suggest new technologies. That I must try to coalesce your empire using only what Rome had at the height of its empire. 

If your visitor were gaseous and electrostatically bound together to form an intelligent being, then creating a pressured environment or suit would allow him to take a physical form. 

We want Ud = Earth's diameter = 12,742 Km. Let's assume a better 0.8au (Venus is 0.72au) and find out how big it must be and how long the eclipse can be. $$\begin{align} 6,371 = \frac{m(149,600,000) - (29,920,000)(695,700)}{149,600,000 - 29,920,000} \end{align}$$ m = 144,237 Km or more than 18X the diameter of the Earth. To give you an idea, Jupiter is only about 11X the diameter of the Earth. At 0.8au we have an orbital period of 0.72 year and, if my assumptions are correct (they might not be), an eclipse of about 12-16 hours with a "total blackout" of about 8 hours. And that's the problem. It's equivalent to the Transit of Venus if Venus were on a level plane with Earth's orbit and twice the diameter of Jupiter. A nice side note It appears you could have a super gas giant inside the orbit of Earth. Astronomers found a gas giant orbiting very close to a small star. 

From a human perspective, believable godhood would require: 1) Miracles. For this we refer to Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Problem solved. 2) Rules (aka, scripture). People expect to have some kind of codex that explains the relationship between they and their god. That's usually something derived from an oracle or prophet. That the gods are here directly would suggest this isn't required... but we live in a world where the idea of an intermediary (whether it be the oracle at Delphi, saints, or Jesus intermediating with the Father). We're not actually in the habit of interacting with god directly, but that's solved with an established bureaucracy and a printing press. 3) Inspiration. Here's your first sticky part. People expect to receive direction, at least from time-to-time. They expect to find their keys when they're lost. They expect to know when a neighbor needs help. They expect to have clarification of scripture. They expect to know when they're making a bad decision. In short, they expect an external conscience. Now we're talking something like telepathy on a one-to-one basis with the people. 4) Prayer. Finally, the second sticky part. Believing people expect to be heard. The answer isn't always "yes," but they nevertheless expect to be heard. 5) Finally, Omnicience, Omnipresence, and Omnipotence. This has something to do with #1-#4, but all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful is kinda the all-definition of godhood. However, the trick is keeping the status quo (see Stargate SG-1). IMHO (and when we're talking about gods the "H" in that acronym is awfully funny), without all four of these things belief will eventually come to an end. Why? Because... Familiarity breeds contempt And all it takes is our benevolent overlords making a single mistake... like bleeding, or dying, or failing to hear a petitioner... and their purported godhood will end. Food for thought....
