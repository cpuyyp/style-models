Print out the relevant part of your links, and carry them with you cleanly, so that you can pull them out presentably the next time it happens (but clearly state what you're about to do, in case cop thinks you're getting a weapon out of your bag.) Politely show him/her the relevant part, and talk nicely about the implications. If cop wants to be all authorative, then request a formal ticket/citation for "breaking the law" which you will challenge in court using the three pieces of information already provided. If you can afford it, buy a sports cam (like a gopro or a cheaper alternative) and use it. If you have to challenge a ticket/citation in court then you have video to show exactly how you were riding, rather than relying on the officer's "official report" NOTE Do not call your video "evidence" Instead call it supporting material. Also let the cop know that the camera was running up till that point. Cop should have dashcam video, and may be wearing a body camera as well, depending on your location. Above all else KEEP IT CIVIL An officer has huge leeway in the field, and sadly their written version of the incident may carry more weight than yours. Hence the supporting material video, and your information. Finally, I Am Not A Lawyer, nor in Tennessee, nor am I an American. You should check all this out with a citizen's advice bureau or similar who is in your jurisdiction. 

I know roadies who swear by pickle juice - that's the brine in which pickles and gherkins are preserved. Its basically salty sweetened vinegar. The pickle juice I have no evidence for, but a nice road rider told me that, as he ate pickles and drank the juice... it worked for him. Real bananas is another one, but I'd expect them to squash and bruise easily. Banana lollies don't work, but bars with banana baked in do help. Simply staying hydrated is your first fix. Depending on the weather, sun, wind and gradient, I can drain two 600 mL bottles in an hour. So for a 3 hour ride I'd need 6 bottles, or stop near a fountain. Pre-hydrating helps too - that's where you drink a couple glasses of water before your ride, not enough to cause bloat. This also helps you pee before your ride. Sufficient hydration helps the muscles to not cramp. $URL$ point 3 summary: Muscle cramps are a follow on effect from overheating which comes about by dehydrating, and point 5 describes bonking. $URL$ summary: Sweating leads to a low-sodium condition called hyponatremia. Then the flip side $URL$ summary: Dehydration probably not cause Muscle Cramps, and pickle juice probably doesn't help. So based on that, the jury is undecided. Whatever works for you as a rider is good. Some experimentation may be required. 

There's no home trainer or roller that substitutes well for hills. Riding up real grades is the best solution. There are sloping treadmills which may duplicate the angle and effort, but they won't be cheap, and running treadmills will probably not be long enough for a bike, nor wide enough. 

Stopping on disks can be improved by changing your pads to a softer type - You want to avoid sintered pads (ones with metal baked into them) and go for resin pads. Downside is resin ones wear quicker, and are not as good in the wet. Check the thickness and runout of your rotor too. Don't bother upgrading your rear brake, the front does most of the work. Another option might be to change the whole front brake system to a hydraulic instead of a cable based one. They give more feedback as the fluid heats and expands. Mud and gravel don't really have "rolling resistance" in the same way a hard surface like a road does. Can you rephrase that part? Try a different tread pattern on your tyres/tires, one with more and smaller knobs in the middle of the tread. This will be noticeable on road and packed soil. If you want to paddle your way through mud then bigger chunkier lugs will help, but only on the shoulders, so will only bite if you've sunk in a bit, or when you're leaning. 

Practice with a spare tube outside of the tyre. You'll see it start to inflate on one or two pumps. Could it be the pump you're using locks-on the other way? When its clamped down you should not be able to feel air moving out the end, around the valve. Possibly your pump is a schrader-only style? There are wee thread-on adapters that let you use a schrader (car valve) fitting on a presta bike valve. They also work as caps to protect the valve. 

ANSWER If you're not saving the spoke, just cut each spoke-to-remove in the middle and remove each half like you would a broken spoke (means removing the tube/tyre) You should do alternate left-right spokes, rather than several on one side. You should also keep trailing and leading spokes balanced by taking out pairs/quads of spokes, being a left+right and a leading/trailing set, which will be 4 in a row on the rim of a standard cross-3 pattern. NOTE the nipple and a piece of spoke will probably fly straight out like an arrow and could do someone an injury had they been in the way. If the tube was in the way it might be a puncture. The hub end of spoke will likely be held by the other spokes nearby. The question remains - whether removing spokes is a good idea or not. You might benefit more from lighter tyres/tubes instead. 

Downside - it won't be cheap. You're probably looking at a sandblast to clean all the chrome off, to make welding work better. Then the metal worker would either tack weld it together and weld on some reinforcing on the back side; or cut off the old bridge piece and use it as a template to make a new one, with more meat in the two side bridges. An item this unusual and old is worth doing properly. As you noted, its not a common item and there are tandemists / touring riders who would buy it as-is, for authenticity. 

Also, some bikes have cable stops that can be removed to show a larger hole in the frame. If your rear cable stop comes out, then you can use a loop of string or tape or even a small magnet to fish the steel inner cable from the frame. Note stainless steel is not as magnetic as regular steel. 

Interim differences summarised: Cloth seat is more comfortable than a rigid seat even with padding. Pressure points (your sit bones) will compress padding to a rigid seat, where a cloth seat would be more forgiving. Cloth seat has better ventilation, assuming an open fabric is used. This allows airflow through and sweat to come out. Rigid seat provides more elbow room, where the rails of a cloth seat could interfere. Rigid seat is more aerodynamic because it is completely behind the rider's torso. Cloth seat is slightly safer because it does poke out further than the rider. This would protect the rider from the ground if sliding, or slightly from intruding objects. Cloth seat frame could be built taller to form a roll-bar to add supports for a roof/rain deflector/sunshade Cloth seat is safer because your bum and back are slightly cupped, where a rigid seat is less cuppy so you could slide sideways easier. Probably more of an issue on a trike where there is no leaning into corners. Cloth seat frame might be engineered to fold, making the seat pan adjustable separately to the seat back. A rigid seat would only be able to tilt on its mount points. Rigid seat presents more power because the rider's back is firmly supported, where a cloth seat has more give and will flex on every power stroke. Cloth seat is easier to build (this is debatable) Both seat styles support a headrest of some sort. Both can be under a kilogram total, or as heavy as you want. Both can have their cloth/padding parts removable for washing. I'll come back with more information in a couple months. 

Example of dual wheel rims on a bike. This is a custom-built rig for polar snow riding. Chain runs through between the rims so they're separate, but the front rims are together. Tyre pressure is given as only 2 PSI. 

Two points not made in other answers. 1) Made sure the pin has gone through the chain first. The pointy end goes right through and out the other side. This is the bit which gets snapped off. 2) I have used sidecutters or pliers to cut the pokey bit, or I've also used bullnosed pliers, but pulled them back toward the chain in the horizontal plane rather than trying to pull the pliers around the chain. 

To calculate your likely downhill speed, you need to know your CdA, your input power, and so on. A website like $URL$ helps give a guesstimate. One example, assuming you're putting in 50 watts of power (and that you're not spinning out the gears) you weigh 90 kilos, your bike is 10 kilos, the grade is 5% down, there is no wind relative to the ground, its a 10 km long segment with an air temperature of 25 degrees C and its 1000 metres above sea level (not sure if thats start or finish elevation sorry) and that you're in the drops the whole way, you'll be doing 62.7 km/h and do the whole thing in ~9.6 minutes. If you don't pedal at 50W you'll do 60.9 km/h and do the whole distance in ~9.86 minutes, so 17 seconds slower. Of course these numbers are completely calculated, so you play about with the inputs. EG a 250 kilo rider on a 50 kilo MTB bike would do 81 km/h on coasting ? 

Left wheel is radially spoked, and right wheel is 3-cross. Spoke count matters too - the front wheel carries less load, so can "cope" with fewer spokes. The downside is a weaker wheel, which translates to a heavier rim. Spokes might be bladed on the front and plain old round ones on the back. The front wheel runs in cleaner air, with more predictable aerodynamic effects. The rear wheel is in much choppier air, so bladed spokes have less beneficial effect. 

Given this bag of parts is $3.95 USD from several LBS and from Amazon its hardly worth messing about. If the freight is too much, ask for an envelope not a parcel or order more things to make it worthwhile. 

Seven 1/4" balls in a retainer do the same job as Eight or Nine balls outside a retainer. I'm guessing that the smaller the bearing, the more will fit in the equivalent sized race, so the number and size are directly linked. So why have a different size of bearing for the front vs the back? Is the weight load on the rear is enough to require fewer and larger bearings? Or the lack of weight on the front wheel is sufficiently different to allow smaller, possibly cheaper ball bearings? Is there a rationale? Or is it another of those "this is how its always been" This has puzzled me for a while, SE lacks any relevant question, and even searching the web comes up with no good answers. 

Bones This would be a pretty bad material for a bike frame, and its quite likely that any bone bike really has a metal core in the middle. 

Your folding bike might use either, it looks like a 90 degree one to me. Note, you should change the inner brake cable at the same time. Depending on condition, its also a good time to replace the outer if anything is wrong with it, like cracks or bends or rust. 

I think it doesn't really matter. As long as you have the two curved surfaces of the orange/grey washer pairs together, then they function as one adjustable washer. Here's what I did in testing - while the picture is rough and the angle is exaggerated, both ways of stacking the washers works fine. Theres a third way where both the grey concave washers press against the arm, and a fourth where the orange washers are both on the right side (ie a mirror of the left image here) 

Its really petty - but I think I've been The Other Guy to someone else. There's a short segment near my home, and I had the KOM on it for ages, of 31 seconds. A fellow strava user comes along and gets 29 seconds, so I work hard, and ended up equalling his time for 7 runs. This was gutting so I worked harder, and used compare to identify where I was losing time (was not entering the segment fast enough.) And then a good wind let me do the segment in 27 seconds. Six weeks later I get 27 seconds again. So the only way to get ahead of him in the system is to get ahead of him on your bike, and do a better time. 

Your axle broke because of the loading - notice how the ball bearings (red) are not very far out-board on the freewheel compared to the freehub? This means the axle is under a continual bending stress near where it fractured. There's a chance your new axle will do the same over time, which is why freewheel designs are relegated to the cheap end nowdays and are gone from most bikes. Still it'll be totally rideable with a new axle.
