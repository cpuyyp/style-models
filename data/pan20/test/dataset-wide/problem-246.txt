You would have absolutely no seasons whatsoever, and thus - depending on the output of your star - either a lush evergreen jungle or a desert, or anything in between, but no changing environment that has different behavior depending on seasons. Also, lack of moonlight being reflected means pitch dark nights, which would influence predators. Better night vision is necessary, while other species might prefer to stay in sheltered locations during the night. Fire (or another light source) will be very important for an intelligent species that does not have night vision. Sun dials as clocks will not be possible, so time has to be kept track of in another way. Similarly, animals need to have some kind of "sixth sense" to tell time and to go to shelter in time. How they do that without any apparent way to tell the time? No idea, honestly. Plantlife would probably develop differently, since trees will now completely block the light. So no plants underneath trees anymore (with a rising/setting sun, those get at least some sunlight, if the sun is fixed, they do not). For an intelligent species, navigation would be difficult without a way to tell cardinal directions by watching the sun. There will be lots of small but noticeable differences, listing them all would prove futile. 

1. Assuming you're using "Ye Olde Dinosaurs", then those forementioned climactic limits would probably be more in effect. While even Herbivorous dinosaurs could have some extra blubber for those lean times, it wouldn't be enough to live in arctic environments. That'd be where humans would have to set up cities. Farming spots would be prime competition with destructive herbivores; humans would either need to take up herding/ranching, or would be stuck as hunter/gatherers, in small tribal communities. 

FYI: I am not a survivalist. The closest I've been to water is on a beach, both an oceanic one and on a riverbank fishing one time. If you find yourself in this situation, do not rely on the methods I suggest. . You nailed two of the big ones right off the bat: dust/smoke and biological debris. But there's several other things one could use to infer the presence of dry land. Plate Tectonics All that was stated about the locals is that they are low-tech and live on lily pads. Having not read the book (and partly from the vagueness of the terms you used), I have no idea just how low that low-tech is, but assuming they're able to swim and have been living here for some time, they're bound to find areas where the sea bed seems to slope upwards, either gradually or sharply. If they can follow the slope upwards, then (theoretically) they should be able to at least find a sea mount, which is fairly close. Coastal Life Forms? If there are lily pads, then they must've come from somewhere! And if there is dry land, then there will be creatures adapted to take advantage of the halfway lifestyle. Birds, for example, cannot live forever on the wing; they need roosting places, to rest and nest. Creatures with limbs can't swim as efficiently as finned or flippered swimmers, but they can crawl on land. So seek out life forms which are known to live at least partly on land, and follow them. They'll lead you to land. Folklore Assuming the locals are native to the planet (I.e., evolved there), then they'll probably have stories about how they used to live on land. Such tales, whether oral or written, can be used alongside education to search for real-life places. The City of Troy, for instance, was a real city discovered by following clues left in the Illiad and the Odyssey. Such reverse-engineered maps could also lead to forgotten islands and the like. Just some ideas to consider. Hope it helps! 

Why would we want to join their empire? We just met them. We don't know anything about them. We only know that they are technological advanced. We don't know if their morals/ethics are compatible with us. We don't know if they would even want us to join their empire, even if we were as far developed as they are. There is multiple ways this can go. They might be conquerors and simply might want to take our resources. Look at Independence day. Not necessarily the most interesting story to tell. Lets say they aren't outright hostile. But they aren't a charity, either. So make them interested in information. They probably want to study us, want to learn about us and the creatures living on our planet. After some negotiations, it is decided that they create an embassy on Earth, and that we keep an open communication channel with them. They send some scientists as well to study Earth. We will want to do the same with them. Maybe they won't hand us their technology, but information about their social structures, their home planet, their political landscape etc. are all very valuable. This process will also yield information about what we have and they want and vice-versa. The first thing that happens is trade. Art in particular. Life will have developed differently on different planets, so there will be plants, tress etc. They don't know about. Those can be used as material in art they might be interested in. Music and instruments are another thing we might have to offer that they might want to import. So at first, the relationship will be based on information interchange, then more and more trade. While art and entertainment always work, you could always make some resources restricted for them. They might live on a quite barren planet and consider large bodies of water to be quite are. Earth could become a place of interest for tourism for them. At that point we'd have a pretty good relationship with them. We interchange information and we trade. So we revisit the question I posed earlier: Why would we want to join their empire? On earth, nations trade and exchange information. Yet they rarely want to merge. Maybe trading could be made easier if we were part of their empire. This isn't a problem we could negotiate a free trading agreement with them (think TTIP). As long as there isn't an outside force / a threat, there would be no reason for us to want to join them in the first place. And even if there was another civilization that indeed was hostile, we still wouldn't necessarily want to join them. They could agree to protect us if they think relations are good, and might even try to ally with us (think NATO), because they might be interested in their enemy conquering a nearby star-system and would like the heads-up and warning. So much like NATO has less powerful members as buffer-zones, we could be a buffer zone for them and be under their protection. In order for us to want to join their empire, there has to be a sense of common shared identity. Which needs to evolve over time, possibly generations. Nations on Earth form because of a long history and a common shared identity, the sense of "belonging together". This sense isn't just there. So the question isn#t really what we can offer them in forms of trade/tech/knowledge, but the question is what can we experience together with them / what events might transpire to form a bond of trust, understanding and to create a shared identity so that we and them would want to merge into one empire. Its an interesting thing to explore. 

No, Billy-Jeah isn't in danger of crashing down anytime soon. Given the size ratio and distance between parent body and child body, Jeah's gravitational effect shouldn't be too different from the current tidal effects on Earth. Keep in mind, though, this is assuming that Jeah and Paveiah share Earth and Luna's makeup; if, say, Jeah was made completely of iron, then this estimate is off. Gathering the increased level of oxygen, it's possible that Earth-style creatures would have increased energy. Big bugs, stronger animals, and more flammable areas. This, though, is assuming that the extra oxygen doesn't KILL them; too much of a good thing, after all... Given the previous information, it's safe to say that the far side will definitely have permanent ice. But the nearest point to the star's light would receive the maximum amount of solar radiation it could get. Given that there's a huge hunk of land there, this'll likely mean that weather patterns will be driven partly by temperature differences, with hot air of the near side rushing away to meet the cool air from the far side. This should translate to a belt of vegetation between the two zones, and rainstorms would likely be frequent along this area. That, I cannot answer adequately, I'm afraid. Because that would require me to make a whole host of assumptions about my species and its current level of technology. Even with humanity, we're only good enough to give a "maybe" for whether a planet even has liquid water on its surface. The fascinating point, really, is whatever you set it to be; beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder. 

Transport to where? Into the empty void of space? Thats certain death. habitable planets are a rarity, and you have even said that help is 12 light-hours away. That means there simply isn't anything in transporter range. The only option would be to transport the crew from where they are currently standing into the escape pods. However, the escape pods are a last resort. The ship is already failing. power could go out any moment due to the damaged core.The batlle with the pirates has damaged a lot of systems. transporters are an intricate piece of technology, the slightest malfunction can be fatal. Its a little bit like elevators and fires. you don#t use an elevator when the building is on fire because it might already be compromised. You don't use the transporters for the same reason - the are no longer safe to use, and running on foot to the nearest escape pod is the safest solution. Another problem is throughput. While it might be possible to transport a few people at a time, transporters might simply not be able to mass-transport several hundred people at once from all over the ship. Furthermore, your assumption of panicking and chaos might be wrong. The crew of a spaceship is likely well trained and has regular safety exercises in order to ensure an orderly and timely evacuation. 

Hill Sphere Every object has a set gravitational field; you, me, the earth, cheese, and the galaxy all are gravitationally attracted to one another. Gravity though is a function of mass and distance, which means that the larger and closer an object is, the more gravitational pull it will exert. This also means that if an object is moving fast enough, but close enough, or a large center of mass, then it will orbit that mass. This zone is the Hill Sphere. 

Let me preface this by saying that, as a mortal, non-omnipotent being, I cannot know all outcomes. I will do my best to answer with what I as Worldbuilder think may happen, but keep in mind that what I say doesn't have to apply to your world. In other words, take what's I say with a grain of rice, and feel free to use your own interpretation. . In regards to your queries, let's first take a look at your world, and compare it to our own Earth/Moon System. Luna is approximately 27% the size of earth, and at its furthest is about 405,000km distant. This translates to about 1.985 x 10^26 N of gravitational force between the two objects. Jeah, on the other hand, is about 14.5% the size of Paveiah, yet is only 17,000 km from its parent body. Considering the size ratio between parent body and Moon, your moon and planet have a size ratio half as much as the ratio between Earth and Luna, yet is also 27x closer. This translates to around 1.857 x 10^26 N of force. . Given the calculations above, here are my conclusions. 

Their society would have evolved drastically different then ours. Its highly likely that people would trade with these years. Religious cults practicing child sacrifices for the greater good of their great leaders. Maybe people would even straight out produce children to sell them. This is something hard to get rid of, because even if you make it illegal, a black market will emerge. People wanting to buy those years will get them, no matter what they need to do. Furthermore, it might be beneficial to have a regulated market where everyone can buy the years he wants. Getting the years of the killed means that you give murder a whole new - very attractive - incentive. Murder is no longer petty, it is good for your own health. Who wouldn't be tempted by the prospect of living forever if only he killed someone every now and then? Its basically the premise of every moral struggle in vampire stories, e.g. TVD et al.. That means a regulated market will be needed to keep murder rates down. If you can prolong your life at an affordable price, without much hassle, then its much better to do so instead of going on an unsanctioned killing-spree. The market will need to be affordable enough so that most people can buy the years they need or want. Maybe its even subsidized, so that even the financially weak aren't tempted by murder. Otherwise people will start to "steal" these years by simply killing random people. In such a society, the conviction of a murder is only a good to be sold. Maybe there is a tombola. Or an auction. Or a raflle, or any other kind of give-away. Someone has to produce all those years for the market anyways, so this is an excellent opportunity to boost numbers. Some people will inevitably be very, very old. 

I'd say it depends on the climate. Remember, Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Sapiens were able to coexist on the same planet for a long time before climate change forced/allowed the two groups to come into contact with one another. I suspect that, were it still an Ice Age, we'd still be at least able to live together. Another possibility lies in a civilization from the old game Star Control 2: The Zoq-Fot-Pik. (Bear with me here, this is an old game, and some of its ideas are a bit...eccentric.) 

I can answer that! Well...kinda, I can give some ideas. As you might remember from school, plants are green because of chlorophyll, a substance plants use to absorb sunlight to make food. It's green because the most intense color light emitted by Sol is green; if they take in too much at once, then it basically hurts the plant. So green plants are the most efficient at absorbing light from a G-class star. Other such chemical compounds have colors like orange, red, yellow, even purple. These are less efficient than chlorophyll, but they're good for fallback options. These might be better, tho, around other types of stars. Which ones would work best where, I dunno, but it's safe to mention that dimmer stars will, in general, tend to have darker plants. Imagine forests of black trees facing a red dwarf star, absorbing all the light it can... For more info, I'd recommend taking a look at these two videos by MinuteEarth. $URL$ (Part 1) $URL$ (Part 2)
