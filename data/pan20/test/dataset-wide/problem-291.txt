This website may have all the answers you need, though the information is US based. Of particular interest is the graph at the top: In the US, only 49% of pregnancies are intended. Note that there is a huge difference between unintended and unwanted pregnancies; a difference of 31%, in fact. 

Rather than a planetary approach, I've decided to go with a biological one. The world is covered with a specific, alien plant. This plant stores a huge oasis of water deep below the ground. During the day, the plant works like a Peltier device, using energy from the sun to pull heat from the environment and dump it into the reservoir at its roots. The tree-sized plant has a tall canopy of broad leaves, to gather as much energy from the sun as possible, and below that rings of thin, fin-shaped leaves, for absorbing heat. Other plants may do the same, in the ocean or elsewhere, though through roughly the same process. During the day, the trees create artificially cold areas around themselves, lowering the temperature by several degrees below ambient. The larger the forest, the lower the temperatures. At twilight, as the energy provided to the tree through light is only enough to maintain balance, the temperature would quickly rise to that of the actual atmospheric temperature; once nightfall occurs, the trees will have no incoming energy to hold onto their heat, and as they vent their heat, the temperature will rise still farther. The warmest point of the day would be the early morning, an hour or so before dawn; the coolest would be around noon, when the tree has the most energy to work with. Presumably, the trees do this for some evolutionary reason, attracting birds or something. Or maybe it's peer pressure - they just do it to be cool. 

I can think of three possibilities that would make an upward-flowing river: Bubble River When we think of rivers, we generally think of water flowing over rock or earth, down towards the ocean. But what if the "river" were lighter than air? A light gas would float upward, along a ceiling. If the gas originated deep in the earth, it would follow a long, winding channel, not unlike a river, just upside down. For a full cycle, the gas undergoes some chemical change at the end point - a "lake" of gas, that turns to liquid and runs down into the earth, eventually returning to the original path. Alternately, the river could be underwater; perhaps oil, floating on still water; it bubbles to the surface, following underwater channels. A river of oil would seem to run uphill, as the water it is displacing forces it up. Outside Forces The second way a river could flow uphill is external physical forces. Tides are one example, but a moon large enough to cause significant tides in rivers would be... dangerous. Instead, natural vents cause inverse waterfalls; as water, quickly speeding along a narrow river, flows over a thin vent, the force of the super-heated gas shoves it upward and forward, launching it into a pool a few feet above. The water continues to rush forward, possibly encountering other vents that jump it up again and again. Alternately, a natural wind, shaped by a rock cavern, whirls around over a pool, whipping the water into the air, where it splashes against the walls of he cavern. The water runs down from the top and is caught by a lip, which funnels the water out, now much higher than it was. A series of caverns like this could transport water up a considerable distance, as long as the wind is blowing - and there are places on earth the wind almost always blows. For a beautiful image, the water may be transported high into the air, then splashes down as a "vanishing waterfall" - as the water plummets, the wind simply blows it away. It's likely the water eventually makes its way down to a lake below, where the process repeats. Illusion of Height It could be that highly-pressurized water from deep in the earth, or water that's come from a great height, is forced through a natural nozzle; the water would arch upwards, appearing to travel up-stream. However, the enormous erosion forces would keep this from lasting very long, and technically, the water would always be flowing down - but for a brief moment, the water would jet upwards. 

Small amounts of damage would be repaired, while large damage would result in the wheel breaking off and being reformed. Locked wheels This may be even easier to design; a creature with a soft, slippery underbelly would find round branches, rocks, or anything else shaped like a cylinder. It would lay on top of the object, pinching it slightly, and excrete a slippery substance. As it dragged itself forward, the cylinder would roll on the ground. These wheels would allow the creature to have a small, low-energy means of propulsion, but still grow quite large; it could also float, assuming it uses trees rather than rocks. Of course, it doesn't work well on land that isn't terribly flat. 

The drug can be easily dismissed as a useful additive if it is discovered The drug is incomplete when it is added to the fuel, and bonds to the exhaust to create the end product, which makes it much harder to detect, but easier to ship The drug is limited to the city; fuel that leaves in vehicles will be burned up quickly, and replaced with undrugged fuel It scales with population; as the number of people increases or decreases, so will the number of vehicles If discovered, the government can easily shift the blame to the fuel companies or vehicle companies; the additive is safe, but the fuel or vehicle is not. Even better, they can enforce laws that making drug delivery even easier, such as mandatory vehicle inspections (to install drug-release mechanisms), or even taking over fuel or vehicle production to keep the people "safe." Fuel is rotated through quickly, so improvements in the drug can be used right away. With a large number of vehicles dispersing the drug, it can have a very short life in the atmosphere, meaning it won't be blown far outside of the city. Means of escaping the exhaust can be government-sponsored (special filters, breathing masks, sealed areas with recirculated air), and contaminated with the drug anyway. Fuel is used in vehicles, which makes for excellent air dispersal, but it is also used in generators, heaters, and a variety of other things; even the most distrusting stockpiler will still use fuel for his generator, which means that no matter what precautions he takes, he will still get the drug. 

With lots of food and few predators, the animal reproduces quickly. As the animal multiplies, they begin consuming the food more rapidly, and predators begin to increase Eventually, there are more critters than food, and more predators than critters; the critters starve and/or are eaten. With fewer critters, the predators die off and the food regrows, and the cycle begins again. 

I realize this answer doesn't fit the criteria of followers and leaders, but it is how I imagine "suicide lemmings" would act. 

As other answers have mentioned, reproduction in humans produces one full set of DNA - half from the mother, half from the father. The half-DNA from each parent combines, making a full set. However, your aliens may not reproduce the same way; the mother may provide the full DNA set to her offspring, and have no need for a mate. Of course, this has a problem: any mutations in the mother's DNA will be passed on, even weak mutations, eventually resulting in a 100% infant death or miscarriage. With no way to breed out mutations, the species as a whole will die. To fix this, pregnancy begins with a seed - not like a plant seed, but like a random number generator seed. The seed-DNA is not combined with the original DNA, but rather is used to set one half of the DNA to matching values. The two strands of DNA may not even be the same length, but that doesn't really matter. Only as many values as available in the donor DNA will be used; the rest will be either random, or matching the female. The offspring will always be the same species as the female. With that system, the female would be able to use almost any cellular matter, as long as it had a vaguely similar DNA structure; even a virus would work. There is likely a genetic compatibility test that the female's body performs, to make sure that the DNA-seed is at least somewhat comparable before use: roughly the same length, not damaged, generally the correct structure, etc. Certain stimuli on the female, along with the donor DNA strand, begins the process; from there, it operates like a normal pregnancy. However, this system has significant downsides. For one thing, one male may provide DNA that results in strong, healthy children, while another of similar genetic stock results in stillborn offspring. It's possible that an outside material could transfer DNA - a hair, a blood cell, even a virus. To overcome the possibility of unregulated mutations, it's likely that developing offspring newborn infants have a very rigorous development process, resulting in miscarriage unless the offspring is quite healthy; thus, females will likely need to try multiple times to conceive. With miscarriages being frequent, the reaction to a miscarriage will likely be quite pragmatic. As an added note: there exists a species of fish, the Amazon Molly, that reproduces via gynogenesis - the fish must mate for procreation to begin, but the male does not actually contribute any DNA, except possibly under rare circumstances.
