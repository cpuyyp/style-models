If 4 swimmers also practiced ski, then there would be only 11 people who either swim or practice ski, but not both (7 who swim but not ski, and 4 who ski but do not swim), so, if there are 13 cyclists, two of them would have to practice all three sports. 

This is the spirit of the book, which can be found at the Marxists Internet Archive. We can of course discuss whether this is anti-semitic, from an informed point-of-view. But we should not take a few sentences out of context, in order to demonise the author. Yes, the book contains the sentences quoted in the OP, and others of similar gist; but they are there not to stand by themselves, but as part of a much more complicated reasoning, in which Judaism is not a race, nor merely a religion, but a especial role necessary for the functioning of the "Christian" society. 

All the presidents of the United States are genocidal maniacs. Barack Obama is the current president of the United States. (from 1. and 2.) Ergo, Barack Obama is a genocidal maniac. 

The nominalist/realist divide is about the relation between categories and individual instances of categories. The realist supposes that there is a "catness" that informs the individual existence of individual cats; the nominalist argues that "catness" is a mental construct build upon the existence of cats. In fewer words, for realists, "catness" comes, logically, if not chronologically, before individual cats; for nominalists, cats come, both logically and chronologically, before "catness". So, the disjunctive you propose seems to be unrelated to the nominalist/realist debate (and more an instance of the determinism/free will, or the holist/reductionist debates). 

First, if we could do away with labour, we would do away with value. Who would buy the commodities produced by the capitalist companies? They would have to be given away for free, ie, they would no longer be commodities. And thus, we would no longer be dealing with a capitalist economy. Marx's analysis, on the other hand, is specifical to capitalism; his categories do not apply to other forms of social organisation. So, labour theory of value is only valid for capitalist societies; once you posit a non-capitalist society, it is no longer valid. So, yours is is not a critique of LTV. Second, the labour theory of value deals with social averages, not with individual amounts of labour embodied within an individual given commodity. If one chocolate factory produces chocolates by Willie Wonka's method - ie, without labour - but the other factories still need inputs of labour, then the value of chocolate is given by the sociall necessary average labour, not by the one factory with infinite productivity of labour. So Willie Wonka will get monopolistic profits, but this doesn't contradict the LTV. 

And it is a valid reasoning. But there is no reasoning by Alice; she is not making a statement about the state of affairs of the worlds, she is giving Bob a command, so rules of logic don't apply. What she is doing is a crime, not a fallacy, and it is a problem of ethics, not of logic. Your other example, concerning the general, goes like this: 

That's also necessarily false. The text is clear: "they all got 8 or 9 (out of 10) as a mark". So no one got a 10, or an 8.5, or any other mark except precisely 8 or precisely 9. 

If the gender divide was a class divide, then gender would be a class. Maybe it is, but such usage is definitely not Marxist. To Marxists, classes are hereditary, which means that you do not have people of different classes within a family. And evidently there are people of different genders within each family, and it is not the case that the children of men are exclusively male, or that the children of women are exclusively female. The confusion seems to arise from this sentence from Engels: 

"It's been argued that God doesn't exist because there is so much evil in the world." This however is not an argument against the existence of god(s). It is an argument against the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent god. And most counter-arguments that I have seen do not engage this discussion; instead they seek to demonstrate the existence of a generic, non-omnipotent or (most usually) non-omnibenevolent god, and then appeal to emotion - to hope, especifically, the hope that an omnipotent god is omnibenevolent, lest we are screwed. The fact that no theists that I know have ever put forth an argument that doesn't suffer from this problem of trading apples for oranges seems to point out that, as an argument that specifically denies the possibility of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity, it cannot be countered with good arguments. Theists are intelligent, smart, logically gifted people; if they can't find a good argument, it is probably because there isn't one. 

There is a more complicated discussion. In a capitalist society, value is the social form of wealth. But wealth and value are different things, which are not interchangeable, and their relation is, in Marxist terms, contradictory. You can put things in these contrasting terms: 

I think there is a basic problem with your reasoning. Party A and party B are not, in principle, just different cliques that want power, and, from this basic desire, would create policy disagreements to the end of demanding power for themselves. The way the system is designed to be, party A and party B are groups that have policy disagreements, and for such reason want power, in order to enforce their own policies and prevent each others from being enforced. And if so, in the issues that matter, it would not be true that "any rational observer would see that [policy A] is better than [policy B]", or if that is indeed the case, then policy A versus policy B would not be the point of contention on which parties disagree and stand on different platforms in order to win elections. True, each party would probably argue that other parties interests and the best interests of the polity as a whole go against each other. But this is only partisan opinion and rhetoric, not something that any rational observer should agree with. 

And yes, all four-horned unicorns (zero out of zero) have three, or four, or five hundred and twenty seven, horns. And so the tautology in case isn't either true or false. 

Mr. Trump is a succesful businessman; Succesful businessmen often misrepresent reality; Mr. Trump never, or seldom, misrepresents reality (= Mr. Trump tells it as it is.) 

I suppose that not only Aristotle, the Epicureans, and Nietzsche, considered some "pursuits to be better or nobler than other" pursuits - but that most people in full hold of their senses (read: everybody except Bentham) can see that there is more merit in winning a game of chess, or soccer, than in winning a spitting championship or a drinking contest - even if no one can "objectively" explain what this difference is. As virmaior says, Mills tries to compatibilise Bentham's utilitarianism with common sense (if we can call "common sense" a very 18 century-ish belief in human natural goodness), and he fails. To my opinion, Mills failure is due to the fact that utilitarianism is utterly incompatible with common sense: we do not live counting unities of "utility", and we could not live doing it: at the time that we would be able to compute the incommensurable possible outcomes of our actions in terms of "utility", the time for our effective action would have passed. For a few eons, I would say. The impossibility of "objectively" measuring something that is "subjective" almost by definition, such as "utility", thence, is a relatively small part of the problems of a philosophical "tendency" that is far more problematic than that. From a different perspective, I fear that the utilitarian problems with objectivity/subjectivity cannot be addressed without cutting the Gordian knot of utilitarian philosophy with Marx's razor as posited in the Eight Thesis on Feuerbach: All social life is essentially practical. All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the comprehension of this practice. Utilitarianism relies on the belief that not only social life is not essentially practical, but that human life is not essentially social. Thence intellectual exercises in foolishness such as In a hospital there are four dying men. Each could be saved by a transplant of a different organ, but no donors are available. In the hospital waiting room is a healthy man who, if we killed him, could provide the requisite organ to each dying patient, thereby saving four lives for the price of one. Is it morally right to kill the healthy man and harvest his organs? - Richard Dawkins Of course, one would answer, if we want people to go to hospitals when they feel sick, Dr. Dawkins' idea is a very bad one. But then we would have to realise how a hospital works in social practice, which is difficult when we do not want to recognise the existence of a social practice that isn't the mere sum of individual, egotistic decisions - or, on the opposite side of error, that isn't a totalising abstraction that negates the individual necessities and contributions that compose the fabric of social reality (everybody should lose their jobs for the greater good of the "economy", people are suffering horribly but this is no problem because the country is on the right track, etc). To that extent, I fear that the disjunction between "objective" and "subjective" is part of the problem. Most social interactions do not belong to either category; they are firmly "intersubjective" and cannot be understood under the usual binary. Similarly, the discussion on the nobility or "value" of individual behaviour cannot be framed under the category of "objectivity" without resource to some hypostasised "common good", or left on the grounds of "subjective" individualism without negating the very ground on which ethics stands, which is social life. The "objective" reality of social practice only exists as it is daily and mundanely built by our social relations, and the question isn't how to get rid of those social relations, nor how to satisfy those social relations at the expense of our individual sacrifices, but how to build social relations that enhance the life of individuals. That would, in a simplistic reduction, be the distinction between higher and lower "pursuits": those that help building social relations conducive to happy individual lives are superior to those that help destroying social relations, or help building oppressive social relations.
