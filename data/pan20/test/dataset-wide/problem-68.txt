Well, the only real-life comparisons I can offer are in insects. But this is similar to a post: $URL$ If you want to go purely with evolution (no "magic did it"), you might want to consider things like longer lifespans, or simply larger beings that go through phases during their growth. There aren't any non-insect examples I can think of, but a halfway example are birds. $URL$ Because they live 3-5 years on average, it isn't too weird that their metamorphosis goes relatively quickly, but if you take a much larger animal that needs a similar metamorphosis? It could be argued that said changes would take considerably longer. As for multi staged changes (as in the two higher 'evolutionary' stages of certain Pokemon)? Well, I would argue that because it takes so long, they need to hunt to survive, and therefore evolution favoured a 'multi-stage metamorphosis', to raise survivability of the species. 

Is it plausible as a mount? Yes. It's already been pointed out that ostriches are viable mounts, and there are even ostrich races. However, it's irresponsible to assume or assert that the elephant bird would be faster than a horse. I have seen no indication we know how fast they were, so I can only point out what is comparatively true. The more mass, the more energy it takes to move. This would mean that, like the elephant, it could be faster than humans, but won't win a race with a horse. It takes more 'horse power' to make a larger beast move, and more energy to sustain it. Not to mention we know little about these creatures. Would they take to (semi-)domestication? Would they be worth the effort to encourage us to continue trying? Would they need more care and sustenance than horses and/or elephants and/or ostriches? In other words, is it worth the investment? Would their top sprinting speed be worth it? Would they be trainable enough to selectively breed them for endurance, a would be needed in a war mount? Arguably, any creature large enough to support the weight of a ride (in armour) is a viable war-time mount. All it takes is time to selectively breed them for the most describable traits, and training them to be able to handle the strain and stress of it battle. So the question, really, is what animal is worth the investment to you? 

I have a pretty close idea for magic myself. I came up with mine while thinking about computer science and programming so i likened it to programming. Think of a single script of code as a "Spell", and with that spell can change the properties, realities, the laws of reality to the Spell references too. That would of course be a very easy system to manipulate, a fight that makes sense would be very boring and easy. So I decided that the magic must be more structured to prevent anyone being to strong too easy. Whatever effect that is desired must be written and your life forces or something with energy would fill in the text. And once the spell is fully filled and written it is ready to execute with what ever "gesture" you have assigned it. For example, a snap or words, or a kick. theoretically anything containing your life "essences" could be used, like pee, feces, blood, body parts, sweat, spit, or just your energy. The more space you use to write Magic will require more energy, so writing small, efficient, and smart are desirable traits. Also the objects that you effect or create will require more willpower/energy the more mass(something along those lines) its has. I also made non humans(Animals fairies, demons) just produce more magic energy than humans do. so a spell to set a ball on fire could be "ball = this exe. statement is snap() when exe. statement= present set ball on fire, or set ball temp BIG NUMBER" Then when the script is filled you can snap* and the ball is on fire Like coding, referencing preexisting objects with their default variable name is probably than making your own object with properties the exact same as the default object just so you can call it all you own would take more energy. so affecting something already preexisting is easier than making your own raw stuff out of magic. I do agree with you that writing magic in another language is better, because no you cant accidentally write in magic. so to answer your question, 

Now, there are quite a few different views on this. The 7 chakras, 'hovering soul' theory, which is why yogis avoid cities and the tall buildings therein, the 4 bodies, and likely quite a few more I have yet to hear of. If you were to decide that 'ghosts' are beings that shed the 'physical body' (kicked the bucket, pushing up daisies, etc) while being unwilling (or for any reason under the sun 'unable) to let go of their mental/emotional bodies? There might be an emotional trauma that binds them to this plane? Perhaps anger at their (in their not-so-humble opinion) untimely death? Perhaps an unfulfilled ambition that haunted their every thought in life? As a nod to currently known science (and those who believe in these 'alternative realities'), let's say there is a feedback loop between the bodies. Strong emotions affect the mental and physical bodies. So, they would affect how we think, and perhaps tense the muscles and perhaps even cause the stomach lining to bleed? Affecting hunger and sleep? No problem with this theory in place! So, you have a ghost that has emotions, memories (from the mental body), and perhaps some ghosts that don't? Perhaps their grip on these other bodies loosen over time? So if they don't 'pass into the life hereafter' before a certain time? They become mindless... whatever, apparitions. This then opens the door to other mythos to go with it. Like hungry ghosts, Yuki-Onna, and any other mythological ghost/demon. 

In case this hasn't been apparent yet, I'm a dark fantasy writer. So expect the 'bad guy' point of view in this answer. Your starting point: a leader. No rebellion, no revolution, no nothing ever starts without a 'visionary'. Someone with a silver tongue, that knows how to sway people -- the masses, preferably. This person will know the hardships of the people they want fighting alongside them. They'd need a compelling story to really stoke the fires of the people -- though not necessarily a verifiable one. Example. Amon, from Legend of Korra. Or frankly, Trump. Bad examples, with arguably dark intentions, but people that speak to the paranoia of the people all the same. Your rallying point: a common goal. This part comes in two parts, true to history. 

Extra reading content: Tattooing reptiles has actually been done before and is still in actuality. There is an article about the methods of marking small animals (Ngaio J. Beausoleil, David J. Mellor, Kevin J. Stafford. "Methods for marking New Zealand wildlife." 2004.); tattooing reptiles is described on page 82. 

For crocodile-like scales, the method would be the same as for humans, although the tattoo machine would need to be stronger to be able to poke through the reptile leather. If the tattoo is made manually (e.g. Tebori), this is less of an issue, as the force put in the tool is more easily controlled. For snake-like scales, it becomes much more complicated. Using the traditional method would probably get unsatisfactory results for reaching the dermis without damaging the scales too much. By using syringes or similar tools, one could inject the ink by going under the scales, but I believe this wouldn't allow a tattoo to be as elaborate as with the other method. If the intent is simply to tattoo on the scales however, then the tattoo gun would do the job just fine. And finally: 

Thanks to the points mentioned in other answers, I could direct a more extensive research, and this is the most satisfying result I got. Disclaimer: I went into much details because it seemed like there was a few misconceptions on how reptilian scales work. TL;DR: Unless the scales are transparent, the tattoo has to be done on the scales and as such, it is not going to be permanent at all because of the frequent shedding. 

Possible? Definitely. Adeptus mentioned The dragon with the girl tattoo, in which the protagonist, a female dragon, has a tattoo of a human girl; it is considered to be a mythical creature in that world. user3082 talked about another possibility as seen in Demon of undoing, where an alien takes the human race as some kind of role model. Whether humans exist or not in the universe we're working with, there can always be a plausible explanation as to why one would have a tattoo of a human. 

While I agree with Michael that dreams would offer no nutritional value, I might be able to offer something of a go-between. Yes, it can be argued that your nightmare-eating creature/being could revel in the control of giving someone a nightmare. But it can also be argued that you have a creature that drinks the perspiration of humans. Now, it is quite possible to do this while they are awake, but depending on how large you make them, it might just make them seem like little more than flies or mosquitoes. However, if you were to have an insect that secretes a nightmare inducing substance? The more vivid nightmares do tend to make the 'dreamer' toss and turn, often accompanied by sweating and elevated heart rate. This means that you essentially have the ideal situation for a bug that can drink the dreamer's sweat, which could be viewed as an evolutionary jump within a certain sub-species of insect. While this doesn't give you your 'dream/nightmare eater', it certainly would be readily explainable. And it certainly would make for an interesting folklore, and likely some sayings surrounding it -- "Darn dreameaters got me!", meaning I had some vivid nightmares. 

For Amon, it was freedom from benders. He played on the fears of those who couldn't bend, showed them what a renegade bender could do to people that couldn't bend -- and they are oh so arrogant, too! For Trump, it's far more insidious. He plays on racial bias, the desire for "a great, Christian nation", and so many other things. 

This is more of a bio-psychology question, and I'll admit off the bat I'm a bit rusty. So be patient with me. Dreaming only happens during REM-sleep (Rapid Eye Movement). This is where the brain tries to 'reboot' the mind, to help you feel 'rested'. The thing about dreams in and of themselves, they are... strange. They are basically (or at least typically) fractions of your day (week, month) scattered across the canvas of your semiconscious mind (here I mean the 'aware' part of your brain). So you 'relive' parts of it in various ways as a means of helping you 'digest' those memories. This typically works out in strange ways (hence my calling them strange). So if you're having an erotic dream, a sensation (a touch, a glance, a look in someone's eyes) could be superimposed onto someone or something else. For example, someone at work/bar/library is flirting with you, that gets superimposed on your sibling/mother/whoever during your dream, because you were already 'thinking' about them in that segment of the dream. Now, the reason I describe all that is to show the clear difference between 'dreams' and REM sleep. You would need to figure out if this 'cost' is the REM sleep (which is biologically needed to feel rested) and 'dreaming' (which is an psychological process of 'processing your day'). The difference (as I understand it) would be one means you're going to be cranky and tired for life (REM) and the other means you won't process your day quite the same way and could become mentally unresponsive to certain (or all) stimuli (dependent on other factors and/or how extreme you want the price to be). I'd advise you research the psychological studies done on sleeping and dreaming, and there've been quite a few. A good starting place, if ever there was one. 

you also have tattoos as an idea, cool. What if those tattoos were runes and magic text spells themselves that automatically charge as you live. so you could shoot lazers out of your hands, electricity fire, or more arms. Or an if/and statements on your lungs or stomach. This way fighting can still be improvised but not as easily. 2.I didn't think of names. Other people here have a good idea from picking from old names of writing. If not wizards, Reality writers? script men, pencil dorks? ANTI TRADITIONAL SCIENCE 3.your magic systems sounds really good and sound as it is. But with magic here, i think society would develop much faster if it were like us right? Now magic everything would be too expensive. But basic mechanical machines are too dumb and dont do anything cool, so if you mix both you can theoretically maximize efficiency. Like a combustion engine that keeps itself going by moving one piston on when one is off and in turn. a water filter or mask that litterly only permits clean things to pass through. if thats what you want. I also made messing with life with magic like tattoos taboo and later illegal or heavily monitored. Powers that come from god are very easily explained. But are just suspension of disbelief i believe. you could have them discover magic by accident and then through experimentation develop an organised language. I wish you cool stuff, i feel bad I wasn't the only one to come up with this idea but its also kinda cool in its own right. I believe that this system possibilities are limitless as long as they make sense. soon Humans will amass enough ambition and power to become their own gods. Keep up the hard work. 

Yours or my system are both prep intensive(not a bad thing), so direct improv, on the spot magic would be really hard not impossible. Because thinking is hard if someone's punching you. So most wizards would prep a bunch of papers before hand like cards books, essay :p as ammo for fighting. my favorite, wizards start writing magic onto the cloths for easy acess to magic on their person. They soon start wearing/ developing big clothes like hats, scarfs, and ties or just more clothes to write more magic.
