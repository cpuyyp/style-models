The 2005 Durex Global Sex Survey asked people in 41 different countries various questions about sexual activities. These are the results for the question "Sexual experiences you’ve had" 

I can find no evidence that David Cameron was a member of the Foundation of Conservative Students. According to biographies of David Cameron he wasn't politically active while he was a student and his political views were not extreme: New Statesman - What Does David Cameron Want? 

Converting the above data from mg/km to g/mi gives CO Emissions of 0.267 g/mi and NOx Emissions of 0.166 g/mi. So the VW Passat 1.6 TDI can not be sold in any state using the Californian regulations as it emits too much NOx. 

I saw the following claim in B3ta newsletter #574 (possibly NSFW), under "US Postal Service hates Atheists". 

Claims such as this about future life expectancy are based on the assumption that recent trends in increasing life expectancy continue. It is impossible to say for certain whether these trends will continue, and there is some evidence to suggest they won't. The article Ageing populations: the challenges ahead published in The Lancet presents this forecast of life expectancy: 

In the EU, speedometers are not allowed to display a speed that is lower than the speed the vehicle is traveling. Manufacturers calibrate speedometers to comply with this regulation as they would not be allowed to sell their cars if they did not. Reference - EU Regulations for Speedometers (75/443/EEC) 

This looks to be plausible, at least for the UK National Lottery Jackpot. The chances of winning the Jackpot in the UK National Lottery are 1 in 13,983,815. The chances of dying on the way depends on the length of journey and the transport used. Number of Deaths for various forms of transport are listed in Reported Road Casualties Great Britain: annual report 2011 along with the number of miles travelled using that form of transport: 

The following table shows that women are around 42% less likely than men to be sent to jail and that women receive sentences that are approximately 25% shorter than men.

There's a well referenced Straight Dope article on this - Can air injected into the bloodstream really kill you? Brief summary - small bubbles can do serious harm but are unlikely to kill someone, large amounts of air are often fatal. 

That gives roughly 360 kg of soil. That's almost twice the world record for weight lifting for women, so escape seems unrealistic. 

BMW drivers appear to be more likely to have had an accident (16.7% of BMW drivers reported that they had an accident in the previous 5 years compared to 13.3% for all drivers), but they are not the most accident-prone drivers.

There's no precise definition for jogging, but it's usually taken to mean running slowly, so I'm going to take numbers from the 12 min/mile column. The average weight for a woman in the US is 74.7 kg (164.7 lb), so that gives a figure of around 97 calories per 10 minutes of jogging. Putting these 2 answers together, I'd estimate that it would take around 55 minutes of jogging to burn off the calories in a Big Mac®. This is fairly close to the figure of 1 hour 5 minutes given in the article. This figure will vary considerably depending on your weight and how fast you run. Is This Type Of Information Useful? Providing Calorie Information on Fast-Food Restaurant Menu Boards: Consumer Views The above study compared different approaches to nutritional labelling of fast food. It found: 

Brief summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing - reading in the United States is in decline, but not to the extent suggested by the Jenkins Group survey. I'll take each point from the question in turn and attempt to answer it. I wasn't able to find the Jenkins Group survey referred to, however I found two useful reports by National Endowment for the Arts - To Read or Not To Read and Reading At Risk and I'll mostly be using these. 33% of high school graduates never read another book for the rest of their lives and 42% of college graduates never read another book after college Reading At Risk shows the rates of literature reading amongst high school and college graduates: 

There are basically 2 parts to this: How Many Calories Are In a Big Mac®? The number of calories in a Big Mac® varies by country, but the figure given of 540 calories is accurate for a US Big Mac®. How Many Calories Does Running Burn? The number of calories burnt per minute when running depends on how much you weigh and how fast you run. The following table (found on Runner's World, data taken from Compendium of Physical Activities, January 1993 issue of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise) gives the number of calories burnt per 10 minutes of running. 

There is good evidence that exercise improves symptoms in people suffering from anxiety and depression. There isn't enough evidence available yet to make the case for exercise improving mood more generally. Source - The Influence of Exercise on Mental Health 

British Medical Journal - Degree and Duration of Reversal by Naloxone of Effects of Morphine in Conscious Subjects Finally, for a more realistic portrayal of heroin overdose I'd recommend this scene from Trainspotting note - contains swearing (and drug use). 

tl;dr - The injuries depicted in the Salisbury Fire Department bulletin are consistent with reports of Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection ("flesh-eating bacteria"). They are not consistent with reports of mercury poisoning. I found this statement from Lighting Council Australia:

It depends on where you are in the UK. It rains more frequently in Western areas of the UK than in the east 

The report also found that similar rumours about large numbers of prostitutes at the 2006 World Cup in Germany (where prostitution is legal) were false: 

A preference for one's own ethnic group is not present at birth, but learned during the first few months of life. (Source - Three-month-olds, but not newborns, prefer own-race faces) Newborn and 3-month old babies were shown pairs of photos of faces to see if they preferred faces of people from their own ethnic group or faces of people not from their own ethnic group. 

It's worth noting that book sales have been relatively flat (source - To Read or Not To Read), and I'm not convinced that it matters where a book was bought. 

While men are treated more harshly than women by criminal courts, this is not necessarily proof of bias. The authors state: 

I also had a look through The Cochrane Library and found the following articles: Exercise for depression 

This incident did happen. The Kenyan newspaper The People has an article on the incident here. The website for the Zheng-Kai marathon also confirms most of the story. The results of the 2010 race show that Jacquline Nyetipei finished 2nd. The time for the split shows the first 5 women together. This suggests that she did indeed have a good chance of winning the race. There are also 2 photos of her with the disabled runner. I wasn't able to find a figure for the prize money for the 2010 race, but the 2013 prize for first woman was $15,000 so a figure of $10,000 is plausible.

An article in The Guardian - Apple's rot starts with its Samsung lawsuit win Makes the following claim: 

Note that respondents were asked if they had read any novels, short stories, plays, or poetry in their leisure time (not for work or school) during the previous 12 months. So this would appear to be a narrower question than that asked by the Jenkins Group survey. It's also worth noting that the more education you have received the more likely you are to read literature, which is the opposite of what was claimed by the Jenkins Group survey. 80% of U.S. families did not buy or read a book last year This graph from Reading At Risk shows that 56.6% of individuals stated that they had read a book in the previous 12 months. 

The FeelNumb website makes a similar claim - Kurt Cobain Was Listening To R.E.M.’s “Automatic For The People” Before He Took His Life (Everybody Hurts is on the album Automatic For The People) Are these claims true? The Wikipedia article for Death of Kurt Cobain makes no mention of these claims, neither does the article for Everybody Hurts.

Bookstores have been in decline and now account for less than half of book sales (source):

Is it true that Atheists can't hold public office in Texas? I would have thought that separation of church and state would prevent any such rule being enacted. 

There is no law in the US that bans high gas mileage cars. In fact under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations manufacturers are fined for producing low gas mileage cars. There are however regulations that place strict limits on the emissions produced by cars (note - Californian regulations but also used by many other states). 

I found this review in The Cochrane Library - Water for wound cleansing This is the Plain Language Summary:

In a letter to The Guardian newspaper artist and pro-tobacco campaigner David Hockney suggests that there could be a link between not smoking and being obese or having diabetes. 

5% of people in the UK reported having had a sadomasochist experience, this is the same as the Global %. 

The claim looks plausible, but it would depend on how you define "operation". CDC data shows that there were 51.4 million inpatient procedures in 2010. The population of the US was 309 million and life expectancy was 78.11 years. So the average American can expect to have 51.4 / 309 * 78.11 = 13 inpatient procedures in their lifetime. I don't think there's a clear definition of which inpatient procedures are considered "an operation", but this does at least give a rough idea of how common surgery is. 

Did Apple sue New York City over the "Big Apple"? Looking at the Wikipedia entry for Big Apple the nickname has been around since the 1920's, so I don't see how Apple could sue over it.

Also, this article in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that life expectancy may level off or even decline due to the effects of obesity. 

I did a search for medical articles related to bacterial infections and found the following article "Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection of the Foot: A Case Report" which contains graphic images similar to those in the Salisbury Fire Department bulletin. I also found two medical articles describing cases where people have injected themselves with mercury. Although both cases report abscesses around the injection site, the large scale tissue damage depicted in the Salisbury Fire Department bulletin was not present. The amounts of mercury injected in these two cases were massive compared to the amounts present in CFL bulbs.
