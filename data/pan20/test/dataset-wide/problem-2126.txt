I don't know what country you are in, but where I live engineers are responsible for what they deliver. So if someone dies because I deliver faulty products or knowingly allow faulty products to be delivered, then I go to prison. Ditto if actively lying or conniving in lying about what your products can do, or whatever, you, yes you yourself, are guilty of fraud. As it says further down, if it's a lie, preface it by "my boss says". Never sign off code or test reports if you don't like it. Never. Better still, find an excuse not to present this stuff to the customer. But firstly, get a new job and get out of there, don't wait another day. And find an alternative exit route in case of fire. And, oh yes, if there is a fire and people die because you didn't report the chained-up fire exit, then you too are at fault. I see below you reported it in a roundabout way, but do it in writing. Mail your boss and his boss that this is illegal and dangerous. Do it right now. This is not a joke, these are people's lives. 

Does it have to be water? In canteens and hospitals they have hygiene bottles mounted on the wall so you can clean your hands as you go in. They have some cleaning solution in there. You could even put water in these - one of those big bottles they have in drinking fountains - and have buckets underneath. 

The same as I always do in this kind of thing; walk into the middle and say, now lads, you are getting a bit loud. They are not acting in their usual civilised way, they need a nudge back into the real world. If you let it escalate, it will only get worse. I have done this all over the place, even in loud drunken gatherings. It has always worked. Maybe because I am rather small, female, older than they are... (and because I have the assurance only a black belt can give you). Of course there are limits. I would probably leave warring biker gangs alone ;-) But you don't see many of them round here. 

As someone who owns a development company and has spent the last 8 years looking to hire the "right" person, I can tell you that your "story" (the resume plus your career history and your commentary about it) would make you a top candidate on my list of applicants. The issue will be (and is for everyone applying in a competitive field) how you position yourself when you write up your resume and especially when you interview. For one, if your age is a pervasive thought in your head that you can not shake, you should talk about it in your interview. Some people will suggest that you not even consider it an issue and never bring it up, but that could be impossible for you. If that is the case, I would comment on it. Bring up the fact that this is your second career path in life and because of that, you are more certain than any younger entry-level applicant that this is the path that you want to go down. You can call on your previous experience in the military, which is always impressive, to show that you are dedicated and hard working. Commitment to a cause or company is rare in my opinion and your background shows that you are capable of that, so lean on that! Once you actually get the job your age will be a non-issue. The scenarios you imagine where you are making typical beginner mistakes are not going to be really come in to play. People who make beginner mistakes will be corrected, and if the company you are working for is a decent one, they will teach you how and why and watch to see if you learn from it. From there it's up to you, like every other person in that position, to take the ball and run. But seriously, I have been looking to hire a veteran programmer for some time! Just haven't found one. I think you'll do fine! Just go at it like any other person would. 

My answer is one-fold: Accept the promotion. You've pushed for it and earned it, so accept it. It's your employer's responsibility to keep you happy in your role and if the promotion isn't it, then they need to work with you on that. You are within your right to go and find a better role elsewhere when you see fit. This answers B) too. Voil√†, you've got the promotion, so you can move on from not having that as something that is holding you back. If your job hunt fails for whatever reason, you're better off than where you started. 

It's easy to add publications to your profile on LinkedIn (and it can generate a pdf CV for you); generally I think it's a good idea. I would say mostly it depends on the role you are applying for with that CV (if not speculative) If they are interested in articles or the content of those articles, then definitely. If your views in those articles goes against what the company stands for (if this is applicable) then perhaps don't mention them. For example, if one of your articles criticises corporate culture and your CV is viewed by a corporate recruiter... perhaps think again. 

What does your employment contract say about the number of hours they can ask you to work? What does it say about the notice they need for time off, and in what format (e.g. written, verbal)? 

This seems like a difference between expectation and reality. Perhaps because of the interview process. What was your main motivation for applying for that role? What did you see it giving you and where are you hoping to go? Explore your options. Is there scope for this company offering you what you want? Is it worth waiting the time it takes to get you there? Is there a chance for you to champion the change the company needs in organisational process (that you thought it had)? Is there scope for you changing the interview process so they don't hire anyone with the same expectation/reality gap again? Do you want to do those things? Give yourself a time limit. If by the time the time limit is up, and it's definitely clear that company can't get you where you want to be, then move on. Life is too short to waste your time working for a corporation that isn't giving you what you want. 

One way not to measure "co-operation" but to make it visible is the Kanban board (or equivalent) and the daily stand-up show-and-tell. "This is what I did yesterday, this is what I want to do today, this is what I need, this is what's stopping me." Here we also set priorities. the Kanban tickets are held on the board by coloured magnets, and if you have priority you get a different colour (green), and the green ones get talked about first. If someone is dragging his feet it is obvious. Anyway, there's usually a good reason, and here that person can say what the problem is and get help. 

Yes, actually, but not in writing, do it in person and off-site if you can. I have done this; I transferred department to get away from the swine, and after a reorganisation he got assigned to us. So I left, officially to get some more varied experience. The boss said, what is the real reason? And I said, because I never want to be in the same room as X ever again. And he said, there's something wrong here, four of you are leaving to get away from this guy. I told him some of the nasty stuff X had done to me and many others, trying to keep it light-hearted and zippy. Last time I went past, I saw X had been downgraded and had to share an office (this is as low as it gets here). So it helped. It made me feel better too. 

I am the only Brit around, so I do a lot of this. You have to be tactful; Oh dear, there are some typos in here, would you like me to have a look? It seems to work, they keep coming back. I have been doing this for so long that it is almost my second job. I keep a dictionary and a grammatical guide and a thesaurus here and show them the problem, and say a lot of Brits get this one wrong too. It's got a lot better since spell-checkers arrived. When I write something important in German I ask someone to proof-read it for me, and say; I'll do the same for you sometime. As a matter of fact it can be a bind if the students want me to proof-read their dissertations, but if it's too long I just do the first chapter and tell them to extrapolate. 

In the US a 1099 contractor can not be required to work on sight during a specified schedule under tight control of the employer. Once you do that, you are treating the contractor as an employee 

From there make sure to include a place to sign and date the document and be certain to include the pages of the original document with your new document. Addressing the issue The final step is to address the actual issue of presenting this to them. My recommendation is that you simple have a casual meeting where you bring up the contract and tell them that you are excited to get started but had a couple do small changes. This can even more easily be done over email in one fell swoop. Simply inform the correct person that you have the contract and have signed it but have some changes that you need to be made in order to move forward. Handing them paperwork that is enforceable, clear, and professional will give them a very quick and easy path to completing the process, and that is what the majority of clients and employers want once they get to the stage where you are basically hired and this is an informality. Including your signature on your addendum (and not on the original contract) shows them that you are serious about your changes but also serious about signing the contract and doing business. From there they will be the only ones holding up the work. As a result you will look like you have it all together, are a professional, and value yourself and your work. ** As far as what the actual addendum should say in your case; I can't really guide you on. I would need to see the original contract and get a better feel for what position you have in the company. The content I had written above is simply sample content and not be taken as guidance for how you should alter the actual contract. 

Outline your changes clearly and concisely. Start the section by typing up the original paragraph that you intend to change and mark it as such. If the contract has item numbers, numbered lists, or headlined sections, make sure to reference those when reporting changes. Make sure your changes are visually recognizable from the original content. Make use of bold, italics, and strikethroughs when rewriting and editing an existing section and provide a key. This section could look something like this: 

It's likely the recruiter/interviewer will ask you your notice period, and that's where you can be honest and understand whether it's a dealbreaker. If you have the time and headspace, interviews are generally good practice and teach you stuff, whatever the outcome. You've got nothing to lose by attending the interview, showing them your interest and being truthful about (essentially) your notice period. For all you know, their recruitment processes could put back the start date. It's difficult to know this from the offset, but if you're keen on the role, it's worth finding out, and it could go your way. 

With those points in mind, have a conversation with your employer and politely tell them you won't be coming into work on the date of your birthday. If this goes well, then great, you can have your birthday off. If you get the sense they will fire you if you take your birthday off (in spite of you following the rules), you need to weigh up whether taking your birthday off is worth your job to you. Once you've figured that out, act on it. 

I think you're completely right to do this and sounds like you've prepared a great agreement for your case. I would prepare yourself for them telling you there isn't a budget for it, and that they aren't willing to pay you (or someone else) to make those changes. They may tell you it's a great idea, and that they'd rather you do it outside, or on the side of, your main role. Which is good for getting what you want done, but ultimately adds to your responsibilities and puts pressure on your juggling skills. They might be thinking, it's always worked this way so why should we spend money on this now? That's a hard mindset to change and you might need to prepare yourself for the fact that they may not change it, unless it actually breaks the deliverables. It sounds like this issue is affecting a customer and that may be enough to have them interested. Either way, stick to your guns, especially as you have analysis to back your argument up. Remind them that you are ultimately asking that this is put in place and you're not just going to run with the idea.
