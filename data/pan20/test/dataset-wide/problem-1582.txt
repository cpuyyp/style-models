This paper indicates that although sun can't hurt the hair shaft, some people use hair sun-screens to reduce damage (perhaps from bleaching?) to the hair. It also notes that any damage done to the hair shaft itself is replaced by new hair growth. This paper studies the effect of ultraviolet radiation on the hair follicle (the part that the hair actually grows out of) and indicates that UV radiation is detrimental to the health of the hair follicle. Studies say: wear a hat :) 

According to the American Dental Association, brushing your teeth too much seems to result in problems not with your teeth, but with your gums (for example receding gums that can lead to tooth sensitivity. Here is the sensitive teeth link. They also recommend brushing twice a day with a soft-bristled brush. The Mayo Clinic also recommends that if you eat or drink something that you know is acidic you should wait 30 minutes before brushing because you might damage the tooth enamel. 

Is there evidence that either of these claims are medically true for the compounds indicated (or others found in tea)? Please note: by "tea" I mean leaves from the Camellia Sinensis plant. Although "tea" also comes in the forms of herbal infusions containing mint and chamomile (for example), I would not expect these to contain the same compounds. If your research suggests otherwise, please include that information. 

@crastic makes a good point that your heart has to be fibrillating to be defibrillated. Here is a link to the American Heart Association (AHA) which explains Ventricular Fibrillation (unsynchronized pumping). Defibrillation delivers a shock to the heart which should (hopefully) restart the normal cardiac rhythm. Although I couldn't find anything that specifically address actually trying to defibrillate a flatlining person, this article (PDF) notes that out of hospital cardiac events can sometimes only be reversed with a defibrillator, and the chance of survival decreases by 7-10% for each minute of delay. This article from the AHA indicates that an asystolic rhythm is non-shockable: 

Livestrong does not tell readers to use a tea bag at the site of extraction, but offers the advice that: 

Here are a couple of sources that might be helpful: This study addressed the "clinical effectiveness of strontium chloride" and found that out of a group of 132 patients, 72% had reduced discomfort and pain. No mechanism was offered. This study seems to indicate that fluid flow is associated with dentinal pain (this addresses thermal stimulation) This study indicates that potassium nitrate works through desensitization of nerve tissue within the tubules 

Though the answers so far have done a good job of pointing out the numerical facts of the matter, the political context needs elaboration. The question cannot be answered alone by proving or disproving the stated fact, but by giving context to the things implied from this fact. At the time of the 2010 general election the government was reeling from the financial crisis of 2007-8. The Conservatives blamed the national debt on the Labour government. They claimed it was Labour spending which had triggered the crisis (and thus created much of the debt they inherited). This then formed the basis of Conservative strategy; they would cut public spending with a policy of austerity to reduce the deficit. However, it's more complicated than that. Firstly, they specified that they would cut the deficit, (not the debt) and this is an important distinction. Public debt being the total the government owes, and the deficit being the fact their revenue is negative: the difference between income and spending. Of course, one needs to fix the deficit before they can service the debt; but the Conservatives only pledged to improve the deficit. Secondly, their claim that the crisis was due to government spending was rebuked by senior civil servants, and plainly false. Before the crisis (as other answers point out) public debt was 35% of GDP, and this increased significantly after the government was forced to purchase large corporations which would otherwise have imploded - as the government feared a second great depression. The implication that Labour are better economically than Conservatives, owing to better public debt figures, is short-sighted or deceptive. It's true that under New Labour Britain enjoyed its longest economic boom. But this is less to do with their leadership and more to do with the economic climate. To understand this, we need to go back to the Winter of Discontent. In 1979 Margret Thatcher won the general election for the Conservative party, promising to end British socialism; hoping to reverse a prolonged period of economic disorder and decline. She liberalised the economy, selling off and closing state industries, and deregulating the financial sector. By the time of the 1997 general election the seeds of boom and bust sown by Thatcher in 1979 had blossomed. This was the high point of economic growth between two low points of economic decline. It's also worth noting that the issue is further complicated by another unstated fact. The present leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, is an "old Labour" socialist, contrasting "new Labour" of 1997-2010. They had abandoned socialism and adopted Thatcherism. The Labour party of today is not ideologically consistent with the new Labour of the past... or even the Labour party just before Corbyn became leader. In conclusion, the stated fact is true, but any implication drawn from it is false. Labour's boom and bust, and the consequences for the Conservative government which followed, were because of an economic environment independent of their leadership. It was a high growth environment back then, which enabled relatively low public debt. Additionally the implication that the Labour party was better, so we should have a Labour government now, is a deceptive supposition, because the Labour party of today is not the same as then. 

If this information is outdated it would be nice to know. A lot of internet sources quote the “factoid” that condoms have “pores” of .5 microns in size. I suspect from my efforts to chase down the source of this information that it may come from the 1992 report based on an examination of latex gloves noted above. This site directly addresses the “pore hypothesis” and concludes that the double layers of latex in condoms prevents the formation of holes or pores that go through the entire condoms. That seems to be the best explanation for the anomaly of HIV not passing through condoms like "bullets through a netting." So, the answer seems to be that outside of artificially created circumstances and assuming properly manufactured, non-defective, non-deteriorated condoms, the HIV virus will not pass through latex condoms. Third, an even more precise question, is whether HIV can pass through condoms under ordinary usage? A caveat to arguments about the effectiveness of condoms is always that they have to be used properly and invariably. Proper usage involves more than mechanics. Health sites often contain warnings that deterioration, and opening up condom practices with teeth or nails, can introduce tears into the condoms. For example, Health Communities.com states: 

At the upper limit of 89.5% a person would essentially be drinking "torpedo juice", which could certainly explain the reputation that absinthe earned. 

Condoms are clearly effective in decreasing the odds of being infected, but, clearly they are not absolutely effective. It appears, though, that the risk of infection from an HIV viruses making its way through a non-defective, non-compromised condom is de minimis. One, however, should not be entirely sanguine about the effectiveness of condoms under all circumstances. 

These kinds of condoms were not widely available at one time. Users would be well advised to recognize this point in making their condom selection if the interest is to avoid the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (“STD”s), including AIDS. Incidentally, presumably, natural membrane condoms presumably make dandy water balloons. Likewise, rubber gloves are “water tight” but HIV can pass through the pores in rubber gloves, which is why the latex used for condoms is manufactured to more rigorous specifications. According to Straight Dope: 

Anyone who has sampled the liquor Pernod has a good idea that absinthe got its reputation from its remarkably high alcohol content rather than any psychedelic in the oil of wormwood extract that distinguishes Pernod from absinthe. This article from Science Daily explains: 

This question is difficult to answer, partly because different nations record demographic data at different times and in different ways, and partly because some don't even bother. France for one doesn't record its citizens ethnicity, so we don't know how many French citizens are ethnically French. There are estimates of course, so we can know roughly, but not precisely. But then there's even more problems when it comes to the new world, where the question of whiteness becomes more cultural and less obvious. How do we define whiteness? How do we define non-whiteness? Barack Obama has a black father and white mother, and identifies as, and is identified as, black. It seems in north America whiteness is exclusive, while in Latin America this is less so. 47% of Brazilians identify as white, though most Brazilians have a colourful and diverse ancestry. This, incidentally, is part of why Spain's colonial empire fell apart. It became impossible to enforce the casta system after a few generations of blacks, natives, whites, and others blending their ancestries. So how we're meant to make heads or tails of it is anyone's guess. For simplicity we're going to just go on self identification and census records. Still, the question remains. What is whiteness? I'm going to assume that whiteness means European ancestry, and so (minus colonies) it stops at the straights of Gibraltar, Bosporus, Caucuses, and Urals. Again, the best we can get is rough estimates. If we go on the largest ethnic groups, including significant white minorities, then it seems that around 90% of most EU states are white, while Russia is 80% white. So, this would mean that given the EU's population of 510m, plus Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus' combined of about 200m, assuming Russia 80% white, while Ukraine and Belarus 90%... leaves us with a grand total of about 624m white Europeans. Outside of Europe, from the populations of former colonies, this data suggests the total white population is about 480m. So the total white population of the world is roughly speaking 1,102m. Now, I am going to assume that "white women" basically translates as "females of majority European ancestry". And I'm going to assume a 50-50 gender split, which isn't going to be exactly true, but close enough. So in that case we're left with a world population of white females of roughly 550m. Out of a world population which is presently 7,400m. This means that we can estimate that 7-8% of the world's population are "white women". In conclusion and according to the stated assumptions: almost double the initial figure, but still a very small group against the world population. And yet to imply five hundred million people aren't numerous enough to support "diversity" (of what?), I don't know. That's still a lot of people, even if a small proportion of the whole.
