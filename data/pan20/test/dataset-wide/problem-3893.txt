Some context: In the theory of compact, oriented Riemannian Einstein 4-manifolds, there is a a fundamental topological constraint that is implied by the Einstein equations. To wit, if $\chi$ and $\tau$ denote the Euler characteristic and signature of a fixed 4-manifold $M$, then $$2\chi\pm3\tau=\textstyle\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\displaystyle\int_M\,\big(\displaystyle\frac{R^2}{12}-\mathring{|Rc|}^2+|W^{\pm}|^2 \big)\,dV$$ for $any$ Riemannian metric on $M$. As the traceless Ricci tensor $\mathring{Rc}$ vanishes identically for an Einstein metric, these 2 (well, 1 if $\tau=0$) topological invariants are non-negative if an Einstein metric exists on $M$. This is known as the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality. One can calculate that in fact $2\chi \pm 3\tau=p_1(\Lambda^2_{\pm})$ by using the connection which is induced on $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ by the Levi-Civita connection, so the presence of an Einstein metric on $M$ means that the first Pontryagin number of the bundles $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ is non-negative. My question is plainly this: Sticking with a 4-manifold $M$, what does it mean in a tangible, geometric sense, to say that a vector bundle over $M$ has non-negative/positive first Pontryagin number? Or perhaps more generally, what does the quantity $p_1$ in fact quantify? Does it say something about generic sections of the bundle (I vaguely recall that the Steifel-Whitney classes quantify something like this), or something else palpable? I'd be perfectly happy if one were to restrict discussion to the bundles $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ above or maybe general rank-3 bundles if either simplifies the discussion. 

If $A$ and $B$ are $C^*$ algebras I will write $A \overline{\otimes} B$ for the maximal tensor product and $A \underline{\otimes} B$ for the minimal tensor product. If $G$ is a countable discrete group I will write $C^*(G)$ for the full group $C^*$ algebra of $G$. Let also $\mathbb{F}_\infty$ be the free group on a countably infinite set of generators. A theorem of Kirchberg asserts that Connes' embedding conjecture is equivalent to the statement $C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \overline{\otimes} C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) = C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \underline{\otimes} C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty)$. I would like to find out what is known about the statement that $C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \overline{\otimes} C^*(G) = C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \underline{\otimes} C^*(G)$ for every countable discrete group $G$. Are there counterexamples to this stronger statement, or alternatively is it equivalent to the original conjecture? 

It is well known that if $T$ is a nonsingular transformation of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$ and there exists an ergodic measure preserving transformation $S$ of $(X,\mu)$ such that $T$ commutes with $S$, then $T$ is measure preserving. I would like to know of there is an approximate version of this fact. More explicitly, let $T$ be a nonsingular transformation of $(X,\mu)$ and suppose that for some small $\epsilon$ there exists an ergodic nonsingular tranformation $S$ which commutes with $T$ and such that there is a set $A \subseteq X$ with $\mu(A) > 1-\epsilon$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}S \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) = 1$ for all $x \in A$. Does this imply that $T$ is close to being measure preserving in some sense, for example do we have that the quantity $||\frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu} - 1||_1$ or the quantity $- \int_X \log \frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) \hspace{2 pt} \mathrm{d}\mu(x)$ is small? 

I'm concerned with the following Proposition: If a compact manifold $M$ satisfies $$Rc + \textstyle\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_Xg = \lambda g $$ where $\lambda$ is a constant (i.e. $M$ is a compact Ricci soliton), then in fact $$Rc + \nabla^2f = \lambda g $$ so $X = \nabla f + K$ where $K$ is a Killing vector. (Quick note: I use $\nabla f$ to indicate grad $f$. I know, I know; technically $\nabla f=df$, but $\nabla f$ is too good as notation to waste on something that already has a name, and grad $f$ is unforgivably grotesque.) One can see this fact quoted in, for example, the second paragraph of this paper: $URL$ The reference made there is to Perelman's first paper on the Ricci flow: $URL$ Perelman never comes out and states this theorem explicitly as far as I know, but the outline of his reasoning for it seems to occur in Remark 3.2 on page 9. Apparently it hinges on the monotonicity of his entropy functional, but I'm not much of an expert on this stuff. I had the following idea for an alternate approach to this proposition: First, solve the elliptic equation $$div(X)=\Delta f$$ for the function f. (In coordinates this is $\nabla_i X^i=g^{ij}\nabla_i\nabla_j f$, just so my conventions are clear.) Now write $$X=\nabla f+(X-\nabla f)=\nabla f+K$$ It is clear that $div(K)=0$. Given that we know that the above proposition is true, it must be the case that $K$ is a Killing vector. (This is because a Killing vector is divergence-free, and the decomposition of a vector field $X$ into a gradient and a divergence-free vector field is unique, which is easy to see.) Unfortunately, I haven't been able to prove that this divergence-free vector field $K$ is a Killing field. One attempt I made begins by integrating: $$\int |\textstyle\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_K g|^2 dV = \int <K^{\flat}, div(Rc+\nabla^2 f-\lambda g)>dV$$ $$=\int<K^{\flat}, div\nabla^2 f>dV$$ $$= \int <K^{\flat}, Rc(\nabla f)> dV$$ $$= -\textstyle\frac{1}{2}\int \mathcal{L}_K g(K, \nabla f) dV $$ (I've omitted details, but I used a bunch of integration by parts, $div(K)=0$, the second Bianchi identity, and the main equation. The details are for the reader if they are interested.). So, for example, to prove $\mathcal{L}_K g=0$ it is sufficient to prove $\mathcal{L}_K g(K, \nabla f)=0$, though I can't see any reason why this might be true either. My question is: Does anyone have any suggestion as to how we might prove $K$ is Killing? I would prefer that the proof be "elliptic" in the sense of relying on the equations as they are and not introducing the parabolic methods of the Ricci flow as Perelman did. Any thoughts at all would be welcome. 

The space of observables is typically not compact when $|F| > 1$. For example, if $|F| = 2$ and $X$ is a nonatomic probability space then the space of observables can be identified with the measure algebra of $X$. Futhermore, any two nonatomic standard probability spaces are isomorphic and hence under this assumption on $X$ the space of observables depends only on the cardinality of $F$. 

I am seeking to understand the properties of a typical pair of permutations $(\sigma,\tau) \in \mathrm{Sym}(n)^2$ chosen uniformly at random from all pairs such that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ commute. In particular, I would like to prove that the following holds. $(\ast)$ With high probability, the graph on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ induced by $\sigma$ and $\tau$ has few 'unnecessary' short cycles (i.e. short cycles which do not correspond to commutators). It seems that the best way to do this would be to have a straightforward algorithm to generate such a random pair. I have been unable to find such an algorithm in the literature and I would appreciate if someone could tell me what is known about this subject. I would be equally happy to have a way of establishing $(\ast)$ for a random pair of approximately commuting permutations. To make the last statement precise, for each $\epsilon > 0$ I would like to know that if $n$ is large enough then $(\ast)$ holds for a pair chosen uniformly at random from of the set of all pairs $(\sigma,\tau) \in \mathrm{Sym}(n)^2$ such that $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \tau^{-1}$ has at least $(1-\epsilon)n$ fixed points. 

The Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem says that if on a compact 4-dimensional spin manifold there exists a metric whose scalar curvature $R>0$, then there are no harmonic spinors; $$D\psi=0 \implies \psi=0$$ This follows from the Bochner-type formula $$D^2=\nabla^*\nabla + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}$$ by applying it to a spinor field $\psi$ and pairing with $\psi$ to obtain $$\int \, \rvert D\psi\rvert^2 \,dV = \int \, \vert \nabla\psi \rvert^2 \, dV + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}\int \, \rvert \psi \rvert^2 \, dV$$ from which the statement follows directly. My question is about whether there's a sort of converse to this reasoning. That is, suppose we have a compact Riemannian spin manifold and we know that there are no solutions to $D\psi = 0$ except the trivial one $\psi=0$. Does it follow that $R\ge 0$ (hopefully with $R>0$ at some point)? My vague intuition for the plausibility of this is the following: Staying away from the zero section, we know that as you range over all spinor fields, the LHS of the integral formula above is strictly positive. Suppose $R<0$ at some point. Is there enough "flexibility" in our choice of spinor field to localize near this negative value and make the RHS negative (by making the second term dominate the first in absolute value) so as to generate a contradiction? 

Let $G_n$ be the $4$-regular tree of depth $n$, that is to say the finite graph given by the ball of radius $n$ in the Cayley graph of the free group on two generators. By the root I mean the vertex at the center. If I choose vertices uniformly at random from $G_n$, what is the probability that when I choose the root it will be connected to the boundary of the graph by a path through vertices I have chosen already? Equivalently, if I take a random ordering of the vertices of $G_n$, what is the probability that the segment preceding the root will contain a path to the boundary? More precisely, I would like to know whether this probability approaches $0$ as $n$ goes to infinity. 

Let $\epsilon > 0$. I would like to know if there exists $c < \infty$ such that for all $d \in \mathbb{N}$ the following holds. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ let $N_x$ be the standard Gaussian centered at $x$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spanned by the vectors $\{N_x: x \in \mathbb{Z}^d,||x||_2 \geq c\}$. Then the $L^2$ norm of the orthogonal projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{V}$ is less than $\epsilon$. I am also interested in the version of this question where the functions $N_x$ are the normalized indicators of balls of radius $\sqrt{d}$. An idea that might be useful is as follows. In order to obtain the desired bound, it suffices to bound the norm of the projection onto the closed span $\mathcal{W}$ of $\{N_x :x \in \mathbb{R}^d,||x||_2 \geq c \}$. Since both $N_0$ and $\mathcal{W}$ are rotation-invariant, the projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{W}$ must be rotation-invariant. Intuitively, this suggests that the projection should be a positive scalar multiple of $f = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u)$ where $\sigma$ is the Haar measure on the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ and $\overline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is any fixed point with $||\overline{x}||_2 = c$. Now, $\langle N_0,f \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) \left( \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \right)(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x)( u \cdot N_{\overline{x}})(x)\, \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} (u \cdot N_0)(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}\sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \delta(c)$ where $\delta:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a function independent of $d$ with $\lim_{c \to \infty} \delta(c) = 0$. Let $p$ be the projection of $N_0$ on $\mathcal{W}$ and let $\alpha > 0$ be such that $p = \alpha f$. We have $||p||^2 = \langle N_0,p \rangle = \langle N_0,\alpha f \rangle \leq \alpha \delta(c)$. Since $||p||_2 \leq 1$, we have $\alpha \leq 1/||f||_2$. Thus one would need to show that $||f||_2 > \beta$ for some absolute constant $\beta > 0$, as well as confirming the hypothesis about $f$.
