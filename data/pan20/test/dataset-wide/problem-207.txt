Refrigeration They may have intimate understanding of refrigeration. It has been used extensively for a long time in physics research. Refrigeration may be possible if appropriately shaped (probably metal) objects can be created; if more complicated distillation tools can be made with glass or metal tubing and variable temperature heat refrigerator sources then ammonia could be extracted from urine to make extreme refrigeration. Distillation is a well known principle that may be useful, for concentration of poisons for example. Knowledge of Mathematics and Classic Physics With light-speed neurotransmission knowledge of principles of mathematics could be very useful, depending on working memory. Complicated math could be done very quickly. Teaching math and physics to produce large projectile weapons and understanding other simple machines (leaver, ramp, pendulum etc. see $URL$ would be obvious things to give. Once math and physics have been taught to one or more then they could be used as walking computers to work out details of construction of such things. 

The frequency seen in grayscale may be very important. Green things would appear black to someone who only sees red light or blue light. Infrared Monochromatic Vision Greyscale vision in the far(ish) infrared area of the spectrum could show hotter things as brighter. An example of this is we humans can actually kind of see the temperature of things once they get very hot: the element on a stove is not as hot as the filament of an incandescent lightbulb, and we can visually see that by brightness. We have a disadvantage in the our area of the spectrum: room temperature things do not emit enough light in our visible range to detect it; and an advantage of seeing colour: something blue hot is hotter than something white hot is hotter than something red hot. Those who see in monochromatic infra-red would be visually much more sensitive to the temperature of objects near room temperature. 

I could think of multiple ways that your sea creatures could attack land dwelling humanoids assuming they have the same level of technology. If they are capable of building functional vehicles as described then they obviously would have reasonably efficient ways to mine materials and create large constructs. One idea would of course be for them to build water filled weaponized mechs, but this would most likely be far to expensive to do for the entire military force, and only worthwhile if the mechs were extremely overpowered and capable of taking out large amounts of enemies at a time. Other vehicles, like planes or amphibious tanks, might have a better chance. A much more effective strategy might be to use ranged weapons capable of being launched underwater, perhaps even nuclear missiles is your species can create them. However if that were the case than the humanoids could likely use the same method against them. Either way the war would be over quite quickly. The sea creatures would obviously have a huge advantage underwater. If they waited for the humanoids to attack them, which would probably require the use of submersibles, the sea creatures would have a pretty good chance of winning. This might be the most effective strategy for them to win. Overall if the sea creatures are attacked by the humanoids then fighting them underwater would most likely be the best solution. On the other hand, if the sea creatures are attacking, ranged weapons would probably be the way to go. Either way, with the same tech as the humanoids they should have a decent chance. 

This is essentially a philosophical question. How one answers will be determined by their personal philosophy. If they believe that intellect destroys emotional capacity, they will say the world will become cold or dangerous. If they believe that the most intelligent thing for people to do is to be as selfish as possible, and that selfishness excludes empathy or often results in behavior which is harmful to others (both, the second is not a given), then they will expect the world to become a place of high competition. Avoiding simply reflecting ones own philosophy in answering this question is hard, but I am going to try it. What individuals and society will do, I cannot answer without simply saying what I believe intelligent people would do because they would be smart enough to figure it out. But, we're not left completely incapable of thinking about this problem without involving philosophy. Our assumption is that this occurs on planet Earth, correct? In contemporary times? OK, right off the bat we know that human beings did not evolve this capacity. (And I will assume that they also did not evolve the ability to create this capacity, as that boils down to the same thing.) The planet and our situation on it might become a serious issue. We can assume that we would be intelligent enough to value our planet correctly so that we would not do anything which causes our extinction, but there are other things which might not be solvable. Not everything in our lives is limited by intelligence. For instance, our inability to perfectly predict the behavior of nonlinear systems is not born of our lack of intelligence. That is a fundamental property of reality and mathematics. There may be general principles which unite the behavior of complex systems, we can't rule that out as impossible (the way we CAN rule out perfect prediction of most real systems), but there may not be such things. That may prevent us from accomplishing any sort of perfect utopia. Also, while we may be intelligent enough to preserve our existence within an environment we did not develop to 'fit into', we may be required to do things which affect us adversely. We might know, for instance, that we could cure all cancer by taking some action, but that sufficient action would also result in the destruction of most potable water, resulting in extinction. We would then be forced to make a choice. The result of that choice, continued existence of cancer in the face of knowledge of how to cure it, would be bound to have psychological and emotional consequences. We might be able to ameliorate them a bit, but we would most likely not be able to eliminate them entirely. Such situations would proliferate. Instead of our concerns being driven by what we can understand, they would, over time, be driven by fundamental physical limitations. Also, maintaining our identity may become a large issue. We are, fundamentally, feedback loops. How our environment affects us, and how we affect it, is the sum total of what we ARE. When we change our environment, we change ourselves. Cutting ourselves off so that our environment does not influence us would destroy us or, at the very least, change us so drastically that nothing which remained would resemble humanity. 

Could a cow produce bottled milk? The answer is of course no; there is no way a cow could do that; obviously. Perhaps I should be more clear on what I'm asking. Is there any way a mammalian creature could evolve to create a substance within it's body that is somewhat similar to the one of the compounds we refer to as glass, give that material a defined shape, and somehow expel it from it's body? In the title, when I say "bottled" I am referring to the classic glass bottles that milkmen would deliver milk in, as seen below. Of course, the lids on these bottles are made from something other than glass, but just ignore that for now. So my question is: could a glass making creature exist; and how would it do what it does? (OK, two questions, so sue me.) P.S. If you're wondering why this question exists or how it came to be, don't; just don't. Edit: Any scenario that in some way resembles what I described above would be acceptable, the material does not absolutely have to be silicon based. 

Metal If appropriate ores are available, metallic objects tend to be much more durable than wood and stone. Similarly if silica and an appropriately potent fuel source is available, glass can be made. Semiconductors could be made, though transistors might be a stretch (for materials see $URL$ Glass Glass may be more durable or sharper than some types of stone. Transparent glass in the form of lenses would take skill most people don't have. Perhaps the Lightspeed neurotransmission would allow the inhabitants to make them once they have been taught the principle. Semiconductors / Electronics Diodes would probably be the easiest useful semiconductors. With a suction mechanism a vacuum tube would be easier and require less exotic materials; still something conductive and very heat resistant, like tungsten, would be required. $URL$ Knowledge of electromagnetism/radio It could be possible to detect the biological radio using little more than a long, preferably flexible, conductor like a wire and one diode made with semiconductor material. Without an amplified power source speaker or light the detector might be able to almost imperceptibly vibrate iron dust or something like that. To block, or amplify, the biological radio would take more parts for a transmitter; and not all theoretical physicist would have the electronic background necessary to understand how to construct radio transmitters. If either of them had an amateur-radio hobby (Ham $URL$ this would likely be possible given enough flexible conductor and semiconductor material; though understanding of how to make a transistor or a vacuum tube would be necessary which hams don't usually know. An old theoretical physicists ham radio operator is plausible. Chemestry 

What would happen to an airplane in space? Or to be more specific, would anything interesting happen to the plane itself, and would the passengers and crew be able to survive for longer than a few seconds? Please note that I am perfectly aware that a plane cannot simply fly into space. I simply want to know what effects being in space-like conditions would have on the hull, systems, and people on board. I wouldn't expect there to be a major difference between a plane in orbit around a planet, and one away from any celestial bodies, but I am interested in both scenarios. While I have no particular airplane in mind, a commercial airliner would probably be the best example. 

The exact controls would greatly depend on exactly what kind of ship they are for I would think that in most scenarios, a supercomputer would be responsible for most of the detailed operations, with a human pilot giving basic instructions. For instance, a pilot might enter a command to go left, while the computer actually calculates the exact specifications of the maneuver and controls the engines, scanners, and everything else. Still, there would probably be buttons and switches for everything, in case of computer failure. The pilot would still need to be highly trained, just in case something goes wrong. And of course there would be a self destruct button, because you just can't have a spaceship without one. 

Privacy is a modern invention, at least for the majority of society. I would recommend looking back at pre-Industrial-Revolution society for some ideas. Prior to that, there was no meaningful privacy really. (I discount 'meaningless' privacy which would be being able to have your actions/location/status be unknown but only to people who have no capacity to affect your life) Families slept in common rooms. Bathrooms had multiple seats and no dividers. Communication with anyone you were not face-to-face with was essentially impossible. Homes contained only the most bare minimum facilities, so most things a person would want/need to do had to be done in public, including bathing. Certainly there were isolated rural farmers, but their privacy would fall under the 'meaningless' header since everyone who could affect their life knew everything about them, and the only people who didn't know everything were powerless to affect them in almost any way. To get meaningful privacy, you've got to be able to be connected enough to other people that they can have a significant effect on your life, but disconnected enough that you can do meaningful things without actually directly involving that same group of people. I imagine the issue of 'meaningful privacy' will be important in your world because, barring some sort of extraordinary discovery or alien intervention which would have a far larger effect than anything to do with privacy, the resources simply do not exist to assign micro-drones to every person alive, collect and transport and store the data, etc. 

In a galactic civilization with multiple races, what would be an ideal calendar system that everyone could use? FTL travel is possible (please no answers involving the implications of FTL, for the purposes of this question it is entirely possible without any side effects such as time dilation). Instant communication to anywhere in the galaxy is also possible. Would there be any way to create a calendar system that everyone could effectively use? A day on this calendar wouldn't have to be the same length as a day on earth, but it should still be close to a human sleep cycle (the other races would presumably have a sleep schedule similar to ours, but if there's any way a calendar could work with radically different schedules that would be great). 

I came up with a concept for a shielding system for space vessels. The outer hull plating is made up of a special material, like modified steel perhaps. Energy from the ship's main power source is used to strengthen the atomic bonds in the material, making it extremely hard. My hope is that this could be used to defend against a variety of things, such as explosives, energy weapons, radiation, physical impacts, etc. Would a system like this be possible?
