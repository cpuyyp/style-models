However, it is true that the rate of forming new cells slows down with age. Here is a quote from a webpage of a lab dedicated specifically to researching neurogenesis: 

A source on fatherless kids (which summarizes information from another source which I haven't read myself), that again shows that many victims of childhood sexual abuse are living with the mother's boyfriend or a stepfather: 

There is a correlation between IQ and myopia (near-sightedness). I believe Arthur Jensen was the first to explore the link. Here is a newer open-source article on the topic, though there are many more. The correlation also holds within families, and is apparently not related to reading books: 

After looking at a number of statistics that don't tackle your question directly, my impression is that being in a single-parent household might be correlated with an important factor of childhood sexual abuse, but that it is not a contributor on its own. Namely, a strong correlate of childhood sexual abuse is involvement of the biological father in raising the child. In families where the parents have a bad relationship (whether they are divorced or not), the most common perpetrators of sexual abuse - male relatives and and acquaintances - have a greater chance of committing sexual abuse. Very often the perpetrator is the mother's partner (whether he is living with them or not), who is not the biological father of the child. (A few sources on the most common perpetrators: first bullet on the page, bottom of page 8, Finkelhor study mentioned in last bullet.) Some relevant stastics: A pediatrics source on general abuse and neglect, that shows that a child living with either a single mother or a mother and her live-in partner, is at greater risk of abuse and neglect: 

Changes in relative numbers of high-intelligent and low-intelligent people in the world should never lead to a change in global IQ. IQ is not a measure of amount of intelligence, it is a measure of amount of intelligence relative to peers. For example, see this source: 

The source itself is certanly unreputable enough for me to not take it seriously, but still, I'm left wondering whether there is actually any truth to the claim that coughing helps the heart to continue beating. 

For example, a young child can have a higher IQ than an adult, even though the adult has plenty more intellectual capacity, because, the peers of a child are not the same as the peers of an adult: 

As you can see from the graph, severity of age-related hearing loss depends on sound frequency: older people need high-pitched sounds to be displayed more loudly, in order to hear them. 3. Does that mean high frequency sound become less harmful as we become older and older? It actually does! But that's because the harm has already been done... It's not described much on the website, but the book explains that there is a relationship between how loud a sound has to be to harm you, and which frequency it is. Sounds that are near our auditory thresholds (under 20 Hz and above 20.000 Hz in the normal, healthy hearing range) can't harm us even if they are extremely loud. We don't hear them because they cause no mechanical change in our ear that responds to those frequencies, and consequently no harm is done. In the case of age-related hearing loss, the hair cells in the inner ear that should respond to high-frequency sounds, have already stopped responding, so there is nothing left to harm. Here's a plot of the connection between loudness and frequency in auditory perception, in which you can see that sounds around 4kHz can most easily harm us. Human speech is at this range, so we're particularly sensitive to it: 

No, staring at a flame will not slow brain activity. First of all, let's define brain activity, and see what 'slow' would mean in this context. I had a lot of trouble finding a source that's neither completely technical nor completely nonsensical. In the end I opted for a combination of the two. Here is a semi-nonsensical one from which I am quoting the good parts: 

Yes, women are more sensitive to high-pitched sounds than men. Several studies (summarized here) have found that women are better than men when it comes to hearing acuity above 1 or 2 kHz: 

Esentially, IQ is a measure of ranking, not of amount of ability. The rankings are expressed in IQ points, which are usually equal to 1/15th of a standard deviation of all possible test-takers. There are standards for assigning IQs to people who get a certain number of questions correctly. These standards change over time, so that the average is always 100: 

So this source does mention single-parent families as likely targets, but if the pedophile becomes the live-in boyfriend in order to be closer to the child, I'm guessing it wouldn't count as a single-parent household anymore? To answer whether children from single-parent households are more likely victims than children living with both parents, the numbers would need to be broken down differently from what they are in the sources I've found. It seems to me that this information isn't widely available because single-parenting on its own is not an important factor. But obviously, more data is needed to answer that question. 

So, neurons discharge at different rates, and these rates are associated to different brain states. The ones of interest to us right now are the alpha and the gamma waves, because they are typically connected to activity in the visual system. Relative to each other, alpha waves are slow (they happen when neurons discharge about 10 times per second), and gamma waves are fast (they happen when neurons discharge about 40-70 times per second, though even faster ones have been described). So, to redefine your question a bit, when staring at a flame, one could say that we are in a slow brain state if we can find evidence of alpha waves, and a fast brain state if we can find evidence of gamma waves. The question is, which state are we going to find? The answer is: gamma. Fast waves. From a Nature paper: 

I found no sources for the age of 34 to be critical, but in my experience a reputable neuroscience paper would never give a statement like that, because a myriad of additional factors are likely to be involved. 

At the same time, the decline in hearing acuity differs between men and women, with men having an earlier onset (already detectable by 30 years of age). The portion of this paper that's behind a paywall (and is not copy-paste-able) says that the biggest difference in losing hearing sensitivity between men and women is in the range between 3 and 4 kHz. In other words, as they age, women lose the ability to distinguish sounds of different frequencies more slowly than men, and this gender difference in speed of decline is the greatest for high frequencies. In this first paper I linked, it is mentioned that women have lower thresholds in terms of sound intensity as well, i.e. they will be able to hear softer sounds than men. The second paper mentions that it might also be true that men are more sensitive to low-pitched sounds than women. In conclusion, speaking in a lower register actually might help not wake her up, but speaking more softly is also preferable :) Whether this has anything to do with crying babies is a different question. 

That being said, the standards are not updated all the time, and certainly not in all countries. What Lynn and Vanhanen do, in the study that inspired your question, is to give a test that has been standardized in the Western world, to nationals of many countries across the globe. 

Put together, these two quotes mean the following: an attended visual stimulus is connected to increased fast/gamma activity, while pulling attention away from a visual stimulus is connected to increased slow/alpha activity. Pulling attention away is typically done my making people stare at a spot where nothing is happening. So, if you look at a fire, your visual brain will be displaying fast activity. If you look away from the fire at a place where nothing much is happening, your visual brain will go into a slower state. Looking at a fire does not slow brain activity. 

Does this explain that when I was younger, I was more sensitive to sound and slept less well? Probably not, except if it was mosquitoes that were keeping you up. Does this fact indicate some trend of our change of music taste over the time? I don't see that it does. 

The rest of my answer is based on this book, some parts of which exist online (which I'll quote). I'll be referring to this part of the website specifically. Sklivvz already answered your first two questions, but here is a graph to illustrate it as well: 

A source that describes how pedophiles work, showing that they need to have ample time alone with the child: 

Therefore, neurons discharge at a certain rate, and we can measure this discharge rate (notably, a lot of neurons have to discharge simultaneously for us to pick it up). This happens pretty quickly, and is expressed in how many times per second a group of neurons discharges. When measured by EEG, it comes out as a wavy line on the screen; hence the concept of brain waves. On to slow and fast brain waves: 

The above quote implies that as a woman, I get about 400 ml from food (men get about 500 ml), and drinking 1.5 litres would mean that I should take only 100 ml of water or other liquids apart from this morning dose. As kidneys work around the clock, it is likely that a woman would either have to be thirsty most of the day, or to exceed the recommended daily dose of water, if she were to drink 1.5l in the morning. Neither of these options are likely to be healthy. (Men would need an extra 0.5l during the day - so perhaps the 1.5l in the morning is less of an issue for them.) About the magical outcomes of drinking more water than your body tells you to, some of which are present in your first link: 

The claim is not true; neurons continue to form, and the connections between them to change, throughout our lives. This paper on neurogenesis (i.e. forming of new brain cells) opens with this sentence: 

It is unlikely that there are benefits for healthy individuals. On the one hand, the amount of water one should supposedly drink each morning in this therapy, would lead a person to nearly exceed their recommended daily intake, all in one go. On the other hand, the magical claims posited are already mostly shown to be myths. This article from The Guardian explored popular claims about how much water people should drink. The article contains a neat summary of references from a review article in the British Medical Journal as well as interviews with kidney specialists and general practitioners. About the amount of water needed per day: 

This is the standard that all other people are compared to, when assessing their ranking on the IQ scale. If the tests were always standardized correctly, that is to (a representative sample of) all potential test-takers, the average global IQ would be 100 every time it is measured. So, no, global IQ should never drop. But perhaps it does drop? It is, after all, a highly imperfect set of numbers. If global IQ were to drop, we could speculate on the reasons. One of the reasons could be that a putative gap in intelligence between more and less developed countries is widening. This means that the Western standards for assigning IQ points get tougher and tougher for poor, more populous countries. Note that this still doesn't need to mean that global levels of intelligence are dropping! All countries could do better nowadays, but the gap might still widen. Following the pattern of IQ scores over time simply doesn't tell us what is happening with the actual level of intelligence.
