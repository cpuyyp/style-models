Of course, the US did not invent smear campaigns. Marcus Tullius Cicero's brother published a book about electioneering after his brother's Consular election over Catiline, which was notable for smearing Catiline with killing his brother-in-law for money, trying to assassinate the Consuls a few years earlier, and raping a Vestal Virgin. So it has a long history. 

The Western Empire did not use the army because they did not have an army to speak of. In 406, the Vandals passed over the frozen Rhine and rampaged through Gaul. Imperial forces in Britain joined a usurper and there was a three way combat under way. No help there. The Imperial Generalissmo, Stilicho, was working on and off with Alaric to regain the parts of the Balkans ceded to the Eastern Empire after Adrianople. These were good recruiting grounds for troops. This made little progress. At other times they fought, but Stilicho was not willing to destroy Alaric's force as he saw them as a possible ally. Stilicho could not intervene in Gaul since he had had to face the invasion of Italy by Radagaisus the Goth in that same year. He managed to capture the force, and incorporated the troops into his army. Their families were settled into Italian towns. Stilicho next was faced with a crisis, as the Eastern Emperor died. He wanted to intervene in the secession to gain his goals in the Balkans. This gave his enemies in court at Ravenna the chance to overthrow him and he was executed. In the aftermath, the citizens in the towns rioted and killed the families of the Gothic soldiers in the Army. These soldiers, virtually the entire army, deserted in a body and joined Alaric. Alaric, without his backer Stilicho, tried to gain his goal of a homeland and power in the Empire by a direct confrontation with the now virtually armyless Empire. However, the total lack of siegecraft allowed Honorius to ignore him, aside from sending out the odd assassin. Alaric was baffled until some unknown person let the Goths into Rome. 

To be pedantic, and to repeat some of what's already been said in comments ... there isn't, in fact, absolute uniformity in the way those national symbols have been constituted around the world. The Gaddafi-era Libyan flag was something of a non-flag, an idiosyncratic statement. Arguably the Saudi flag is as much a banner as a flag. The Nepali flag, as you say, is more of a pennant than a flag. And at least two countries don't have a national day, according to this Washington Post map. As for national anthems, some countries share the same tune and, as far as I'm aware, at least one country (Spain) has a national anthem with no words. So it isn't as if there are any basic rules on anthems (words, uniqueness) which the world's states have signed up to. But in any case, if you're establishing a new sovereign state, and even if you've already got a cute ceremonial rod or a damn fine national dance, why not also find yourself a flag, and a tune and a feast day? They cost nothing, add to the gaiety of nations, and the neighbours, even if they aren't going to force you, sort of expect you to have one. 

Later on, gladiators were not only slaves, but ex-soldiers and free men as well. An ex-soldier would be intimately familiar with the (Roman) arms and armor he had worn during his service, but the gladiators rarely appeared as Roman troops, in the current garb of the day, so even the soldiers, those with the most training already, might need other training on how to properly use weapons and armor used by the barbarians, or perhaps Roman legions of by-gone eras. (The whole gladiatorial period lasted several centuries, and times change.) 

This is a question without anything possible but anecdotal answers. The first comprehensive sexual scientific study wasn't until 1948 when Alfred Kinsey produced Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. In 1966, Masters & Johnson produced Human Sexual Response. Unfortunately for your question, neither of these studies concentrated on Sexual Awareness of Children in Lower Class Families of the 19th Century. (First, thank you for allowing me to use the word sexual legitimately so many times and second, that sounds like a great title for a thesis... hmmmm) During the major industrial revolution, in the cities, families were actually down-sizing, but your description of family nighttime life is pretty spot on, in that there was often a single room, and if lucky a single bed. This was not only true for lower class first world countries, but second- and third-world ones as well. My own thoughts on the matter are that youngsters (pre-pubescent) wouldn't be likely to understand or comprehend the moans and groans and movements they may have witnessed, but the older teenagers certainly would. However, as the majority of older children worked, be it on the farm, or in the city, they'd be more likely to be sound asleep rather than spying on mom and dad's shenanigans. 

What purpose was served by Argentina's occupation of South Georgia immediately prior to the invasion of the Falklands? The famously elaborate operation, involving marines masquerading as scrap metal merchants and obscure diplomatic slights would appear to have achieved nothing of value. A miniature side show compared to the main Falklands war. What did Buenos Aires intend it to achieve? If it was meant as a test of British resolve it surely made no sense to launch the full Falklands invasion almost in parallel and before evaluating the British response. If it was intended as a diversionary tactic it turned out to be anything but. If Argentina intended it to be strategically vital to defending the Falklands they were deluded since the British easily retook it some weeks later. Why bother with South Georgia as a preliminary campaign? If, as Argentina intended and hoped, the Falklands occupation had been accepted by the British and the rest of the world as a fait accompli then South Georgia would quietly have been included in any eventual settlement. 

And certainly you can see that politically Stalin and his Polish communists had much to gain from being rid of the Germans even before the end of the war, so that the huge westward shift in the German frontier which they wanted to impose on the western allies ... could be made a fait accompli. So did the Red Army want to capture Germans or not? 

In Tudor days, people could die in prison for any number of reasons besides murder, even a nice prison like the Tower could be. 

By this time, consul is more a status title than any position giving political authority. So it likely is just that the emperor wanted to reward that family with a plum and for whatever reason this child was selected rather than someone more mature. Perhaps the father had already been consul. 

Just as in the elections themselves, what actually went on in the USSR did not necessarily match what the rules and law said was going on. People might be cautious that if you weren't seen voting, there would be consequences no matter what the law said. 

Mines, like most other passive defense systems, have a limited utility. Mines don't stay in one spot, as storms and currents move them, sometimes into your own areas. Mines fail as sea-water corrodes them. You have to place them in huge areas yet a narrow swept lane negates nearly all of their usefulness. So unless you already control the seas, your mines will be negated. If you do control the sea, then mines are something of a danger to you! Subs are more expensive, but can move into contested waters and hunt the enemy. They can be moved from place to place, and keep their weapons in order until needed. If the battleground moves, they can move with it. 

I wonder whether what you're recalling was the battle waged against Einstein by the Woman Patriot Corporation. The "corporation" was anti-suffragette in character, possibly anti-Jewish and certainly anti-communist and anti-pacifist. In 1932 the organisation filed a memorandum complaining about Einstein's return to the United States. They claimed, according to Einstein on Politics: His Private Thoughts And Public Stands on Nationalism, Zionism, War, Peace, and the Bomb edited by David E. Rowe, Robert J. Schulmann: 

Britain and France were allies and equal partners in shaping the post-WW1 settlements, and French interests in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East were powerful and historic. Presumably, also, France was just as interested in oil as Britain was. How was Britain suddenly able to gobble up Mosul simply because oil had been discovered there? Did Britain concede territory to France somewhere else as part of the negotiations? 

Between 24th June 1948 and 12th May 1949 land routes into West Berlin were blocked by Soviet forces and West Berliners were supplied entirely by air (the famous Berlin Airlift). No one connected with the Soviet authorities had thought Berlin could be supplied this way. But contrary to expectations the airlift was an astonishing logistical succcess, eventually bringing in supplies at a rate which exceeded what had been provided by road and rail prior to the crisis. So, although "because it wasn't working" is the flippant answer to my question, that doesn't explain Soviet thinking. While the blockade was clearly a failure from the Soviet point-of-view, at the same time it (seemingly) cost nothing to maintain. It was a success for the western allies, and a glorious one, but its costs were high. Wikipedia's article only suggests that "humiliation" forced the Soviets to lift the blockade, but surely ending the blockade and admitting their defeat was humiliating in its own right. Why not just impose the blockade indefinitely? Airlift or no airlift. Did the blockade impose costs on the Eastern Bloc which aren't immediately apparent? Damage to goodwill (both inside Germany and in the wider world)? Trade costs? Were there economic levers which the western allies were able to apply quietly to help end the blockade? 

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. He sailed farther than anyone else had ever done, on three tiny ill-equipped ships. After days of sailing he finally reached his intended destination and discovered the Westward sea route to the East Indies. Unfortunately he didn't actually reach his goal. Fortunately for me, he discovered the new world. Were there other explorers heading out into the unknown and uncharted waters Westward from Spain, England, or Portugal that failed? In other words, everyone remembers the winner, and second place is another word for loser. Who were some also-rans? 

If you meet the enemy as they begin to cross, they may halt their crossing, preventing the attack. They may fire at you from the far shore. If you let only as much of the enemy force as you can handily defeat, cross the river, you can easily defeat them while the reinforcements attempt to cross to their comrades. This is a form of "divide and conquer." 

That was it. At all times, out of the harbor, they operated in war time conditions, which meant submersed most/all of the daylight hours, and at night, 5 men above decks. 

Well, drugs and drug abuse has been around since the beginning of man, of that I am positive. In the Victorian era, for instance, addiction to laudanum was a major thing. Mary Todd Lincoln (the First Lady) was said to have been so addicted. As far as the American 50's, according to a blog I read the wide-spread drug abuse of the 60's was the direct result of the behind-the-scenes drug use of the 50's. The Beat Generation (aka Beatnicks) were the abusers of the 50s. WWII caused a boom in the development of pain killers. The drugs of choice of the 50s appear to have been Marijuana, Heroin and LSD. Their main usage demographics, however, were mostly inner-city and the so-called Jazz-scene. The blog is pretty enlightening and finished with several citations. Well worth a read. My Google search terms used here was "drug use in the 50s" 

During his dictatorship, candidates were appointed by Sulla for reasons of his own. I believe the elections of 79 BC were also restricted access. In 78 AD, the consul Lepidus ran on a platform of reforming Sulla's changes and won the top spot. This was probably the first fully free election the Romans had in the post-Sullan period. Plutarch's Life of Sulla 

Early reinforcements to Tunisia were a German armored division (10 Panzer) and an Italian (Superga) and infantry. Hitler promised more, and the retirement of Afrika Corps to Tunisia in February would add those forces to the mix, but these aren't relevant to Stalingrad Relief. So it seems that in theory the Axis might have sent 1 German and 1 Italian armored division to partake in the relief, if they could have carried the forces to the far steppes in time, which is questionable. Certainly these forces would have had trouble with the difference in climate between the Mediterranean and USSR. It doesn't seem like this made a lot of difference here. Also, historically the moves to Tunisia happened before Stalingrad was attacked. So you can't cast it as a choice. And if you don't send those forces to Tunisia, the Afrika corps is lost by January rather than May 1943. From Wiki 

Conventional wisdom says that the USSR was very weak in 1939/40/41, in large part due to the purges of the 1930s, ideological interference in the armed forces, and lack of equipment, preparation and tactical sophistication. This is the usual explanation for the poor showing of the USSR in the Winter War against Finland in 1940 and the colossal defeats in the early stages of Barbarossa. Later in the war, it is said, the Red Army recovered from the purges, Stalin learnt to interfere less and soviet tactical sophistication evolved. But only later on. Similarly, for a time, Japan seemed unstoppable, with vital areas of China as well as British, American and Dutch possessions overrun at tremendous speed in the early 1940s. Only later was she defeated by the might of a fully mobilised United States and the vastness of China. But only later. So how then to explain the USSR's defeat of Japan at the little known (in the West) battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939? 

Ian Kershaw's Hitler biography Nemesis describes Hitler's hurriedly arranged summit with Mussolini in July 1943: 

You are asking at least two different questions. As to whether you could be Jewish and "get away with it", at least until someone denounced you, I don't think it worked like that. Your ethnicity was known to the state, via your birth certificate and other essential documents. There were borderline cases involving people who were fractionally Jewish, and there were rules laid down for those. In the event of a dispute, I suppose your case went to judicial review/appeal. See also the Ahnenpass. Your other question involves the status of German Jews in Germany around 1943. No the authorities didn't imprison or expel all Jews even as late as 1943. Your status and treatment depended on a number of tests. Far and away the best guarantee of your "safety" was to have a non-Jewish spouse. Also helpful was to have served in the German Army in WW1. I imagine financial means and influential connections also came into it. So a Jew who could tick some of those boxes could still be technically "at liberty" in Germany in 1945 (as the diarist Victor Klemperer was). At liberty, in Victor Klemperer's case, meant being confined to a "Jew House" (extremely cramped communal housing), very reduced rations compared to other Germans, unable to work (except for humiliating work duties such as road sweeping and snow clearing which he was required to perform), and constantly in fear of arrest. But not necessarily actually imprisoned. Being denounced to the gestapo need have nothing to do with being Jewish. Favourites included black marketeering, not complying with blackouts, listening to foreign radio, defeatist talk. Could it be your character was denounced for one of these "crimes"? If you faced one of these charges and were also Jewish, then you faced far graver consequences of course. Then there were all the things that Jews weren't allowed to own or use (e.g. bicycles 1936, radios 1939). Your concentration camp survivor could have been denounced, not for being a Jew per se, but for flouting one of those anti-Jewish laws. 

Besides official or secret agent movement of news and papers, it was routine for soldiers on picket duty to swap newspapers and reading material along with coffee and tobacco when armies were in contact. The desire for different reading material was very strong. 

Here are some other examples: The US Civil War. Much of the history was driven by the South's need to justify itself especially after the first 20 years up to about 1960 or so. The Fall of the Roman Republic Virtually all of the surviving histories were written by the conservative factions of Rome and not by the Caesarian side. Augustus didn't mind that much as it let the elite blow off steam while he ran things as suited him. 

Christianity became the official religion of Rome under Constantine (306-337 AD). Soon after that there were major doctrinal disputes between the Bishops of Alexandria that had to be arbitrated between his sons. So by 350 AD at the latest you'd have to say Christianity was well established. Of course, long before that Greek and Roman influence might have replaced Amon Ra. 

It comes down to two issues: no army to send and no navy to get it there. The war of Hannibal and the Barcas against Rome was more or less a personal project by that family, who controlled Spain and its resources and built up their armies there. Hannibal's initial thrust across the Alps and into Italy needed to be done because Rome had complete control of the seas. Rome sent the forces intended to stop Hannibal in Gaul on to Spain, and raised new forces to fight him in Italy. They faced Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal there for some years. In Carthage proper, there were essentially no troops at all. There was also not much of a navy, or shipping to carry troops to Italy. So when Hannibal's march ended up in essentially a stalemate, there was no way to get more than a trickle of help through the blockade, although it was a constant concern, especially when King Philip of Macedon allied with Hannibal. After some years, Hannibal's brother faced a deteriorating situation in Spain himself and marched to join Hannibal, as while he had an army there was no other way to get to Italy. He was caught and his army destroyed by the consuls of the year in North Italy. When Scipio Africanus invaded Africa some years later, there was still no real army in Africa to face him. Hannibal had to be recalled for the final battle at Zama.
