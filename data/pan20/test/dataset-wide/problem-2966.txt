I think you're basically right about how the discussion goes on this point, but it's not necessarily a "fallacy." First off, a minor correction in structure: 

This argument is formally valid. But the argument is not sound. Validity means if the premises were true, the conclusion must also be true. Soundness means validity and true premises. Where then does this argument go wrong? I would say that it goes wrong in that we have no reason to believe the first premise is true. Thus, the argument appears to engage in what we can call a "false cause fallacy." But again, it's not important to name the fallacy so much as it is to show that an argument is wrong. 

Within the addition, the part you're quoting appears as the analogy to argue from -- not the claim to argue to. The Hegel quote is not trying to make a point about matter but about freedom and the will. The quote continues: 

I will start with the second issue. I'd say a better definition of proof by contradiction is as follows: 

Now to try and answer your questions, For 1, I assume by "these two", you mean Spirit and time. On my reading, time is not a very important concept for Hegel. Instead, he's more concerned with Spirit and/or the Concept. Spirit (Geist) and Concept (Begriff) are two sides of the same coin for Hegel. Spirit is the active part -- the mind -- and concept is the receptive part -- the matter, and the whole final product is thought thinking itself (just like Aristotle -- but now the thought is the whole of the universe itself thinking about itself with a thinking part (us) and a part being thought about (us + things that don't think)). For 2, there's going to be an identity between Spirit and the activity of negating the negation as it happens through time. If you look at the Phenomenology of Spirit, one of the interesting claims that Hegel has is that all consciousness is self-consciousness. (Or to reword that, Hegel is a Kantian insofar as concepts organize our thoughts and knowledge, but not a Kantian in not being committed to two categories and in rejecting that we can't know things in themselves) So then we have a procession that looks something like this: 1. We already knew that "space" (here not to be confused with how the term is used in physics) is a negation whereby we carve the world into bits. 2. We learn "time" is the negation of "space". 3. We then realize that the carving of the world into "time" (on top of the carving of it into "space") is the activity of Spirit. 4. Ergo, there's an identity between "time" as the negation of negation and Spirit as the term for the consciousness that encounters the world with this framing. For 3, there's two senses, for Hegel, in which Spirit must fall into time. First, the activity of spirit happens in time. This is important for Hegel, because Hegel is not positing a world of Platonic forms. Instead, all of the distinctions that Spirit makes are for Spirit in time. Thus it "falls into time" insofar as it is not atemporal. Second, since "time" is a category Spirit is imposing on its world, then the Spirit is of course under time whenever it's doing anything -- since Hegel is a realist about the things Spirit is discovering (reworded: Spirit's discovery about time is not merely that Spirit has time as a category but that everything is under time -- including Spirit). There's an extra reason of course for Heidegger to be interested in this in the second part of Being and Time which is that time is the existentiell of the self and temporality is the fundamental category of Da-Sein (see 397). This last point is not something Hegel (or Hegelians) would agree to. 

Descartes' argument in Meditation 2 is quite different from what a simple reading of "I think, therefore I am" would mean. Specifically, we need to grasp a few things that have already happened in the meditations: 

One part of your question that I didn't address in very much detail was the "dueling notion" part. A major impetus is that I'm not sure I understand what is being asked on that particular front. If the question is, does Chinese thought put good in conflict with evil? Then, my answer would be yes. Is there a high God who is at war with Satan and evil? Then, in general (with the possible exception of some interpretation of 天 tian), the answer is no. Is there a world where we need to marshall resources to keep the good alive? Then, for the Confucian school, yes. For the Daoists, then sort of kind of, but with "good" needing to be understood in a very distinct light that should not be confused with say traditional morality or being a part of normalish Chinese society. Instead, it's a type of convergence with 道 Dao (whether understood as 然 zi (nature) or something distinct), that does not get confused with the "good" dictated by society. 

I don't have my text with me, but Kant's view in Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone is that God necessarily comes to the same conclusions of reason with regards to morality and is not necessary for our moral reasoning. (The same view is implied in some of Kant's earlier moral works -- note the absence of an appeal to theology in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals , Metaphysics of Morals, and Critique of Practical Reason). To simplify, the source of morality is reason for Kant, and God has reason and thus comes to the same conclusions. Those who need to think of God to come to the conclusions of reason are in Kant's view using a crutch. Thus, Kant rejects the voluntarist position that God is above morality. Despite this, Kant still maintains that God is necessary for morality to maintain what is often called the "proportionality thesis". This is the idea that people will receive happiness in proportion to the degree that they are moral. Kant recognized that this was not true in this world and make God a "postulate of moral reason" (at least in the Critique of Practical Reason) in order to make it so that being moral makes sense in terms of fairness (by becoming eternally fair). 

I don't work in philosophy of mind, but this is my impression from reading your confusion and my sense of how the Chinese Room objection works. My point here is not to endorse Searle but to explain where I think a lot of confusion is coming from with respect to this issue. I am not asking you to agree but rather just to recognize that if the terms mean what I'm suggesting they do for Searle, that there's a coherence to Searle's position. Whereas if you don't take the terms to mean that, then Minsky's position looks a lot more attractive. 

There's a lot of interesting features to the question. First, you need to consider how serious Socrates is being vs. how much of a joke he's making of the whole thing. Second, it's important to realize "Socrates" is a character Plato is using and the Apology is largely agreed to not be a factual representation of what's going on (See What did Socrates mean by " there is no more fitting reward than maintenance in the prytaneum"? and Did Plato record actual conversations in his dialogues?). Building on these two considerations, we can trace the narrative form of Socrates' claim and then ask whether he's being a jerk to the people of Athens or he's just that genuinely inquisitive and naturally trusting of what others tell him. So here's the narrative as Plato writes it (at least on my reading): 

On my reading, Kant is committed to something close to 2 but not to 1. 1 is a claim about what isn't "out there." 2 is a claim about the way minds work. Thus, Kant states 

The main thing happening here is a shift in the meaning of terms. Specifically, the word "realist" has had many many different uses over time. The basic idea is that a realist believes something is real, i.e. that such entities do in fact exist, that they are metaphysical objects in their own right (rather than existing as modalities on the mind). Realism when used in reference to mathematical realism and Plato is that X is believes Y do in fact exist. So Plato is a realist about Platonic Forms. Mathematical realists believe numbers do in fact exist. Plato's view stands in contrast to Aristotle's view -- which while also realist with respect to forms does not think the forms exist as ideas. Instead, they exist as essences in substances. In contemporary language, this is the debate over universals. Anti-realist views think that these things only exist in our heads as words or concepts. (Realist views can of course accept that we also make words or terms for these things). The term idealism doesn't generally occur in this debate. Idealism instead refers to views where things only exist due to the mind. It's a partial offshoot of rationalism generally associated with Schopenhauer. Hegel is often called an idealist as well, but I would argue this is a misnomer. 

multiple realizability multiple realizability is the claim that the same mental state can be realized in multiple physical ways. Regardless of how, this would imply that the identity is broken, because the same thing can occur in ways that differ. 

There's several ways in which you're using potential and actual strikes me as very non-Aristotelian fashion in your question. To grasp what Aristotle is talking about with potential and actual, you need to recognize he's working on the problem of change and his resolution is to work from a concept of substance with properties and accidents. This contrasts to his representations of Heraclitus and (what sort of kind of seems like) Parmenides who advocate either that nothing has fixity or nothing changes respectively. Aristotle's solution is to speak of substances and to divide potential and actual in two ways. Something that has no form and only matter is pure potential (or potential potential if you like). Something that has form and matter has actuality and potential. Something that is pure act has no potential (this is also Aristotle's definition of God). Now, we can turn to the SEP article and try to make sense of what it is saying. First off, it's not the article on potential and actual in Aristotle -- there are two better suited articles: Aristotle's metaphysics and Aristotle's natural philosophy. You may wish to look at those to better understand the issue. If we want to speak of the potentials of the statue, then these are going to be the changes the statue could undergo and still be the same substance. If we speak of potentials simpliciter, this could be anything. Thus, when you ask whether becoming a disk is a potential of bronze statue, the answer is no. Sure, that could be done, but it is done precisely by eliminating the bronze statue -- so it's not a potential of the bronze. Conversely, if you paint it green or blue or any other color, then it remains a bronze statue (there's a complex problem in this particular example in that Aristotle has a special treatment for artifact [human made things] -- so leaving aside any necessity of the color we see being bronze, it can work). Thus, generically, there is a potential to change what a thing is, but that is not a potential of that thing. This account is best suited to natural kinds. So for instance, a human being does not have the potential to have no heart -- because that would kill the person and change the sort of thing we are talking about. But a human being does have the potential to have any hair color they want (with the use of some chemicals) 

The problem of universals arises because we generally encounter things in the world under kinds and properties. As in, I go throughout the world and see apples, cans of coke, trees, people, yellow bananas, tall trees, square boxes, grey elephants, etc. The problem of universals can be addressed in two ways, either we need to explain what these universal categories are or we need to explain away the way that our cognition works. Realist Explanations The two most famous classical Western accounts provided related but different explanations, with Plato positing the forms/ideas (from a separate world) and Aristotle essences/forms (in natural things as their organizing principles). This manner of thinking was echoed in Augustine and Aquinas. Modifying your (1): 

I'm not quite sure how to integrate this (it's not an answer per se) but rather an encyclopedic addition based on two things I've run across. Maybe this can be a collection of text references to people commenting on Hegel and the Nazis? (or perhaps this doesn't fit within the SE model and should be deleted). Thulstrup's Kierkegaard's Relation to Hegel (1979 or 1980) - comments on the point that Hegel is too obscure for this to become likely (I no longer have the page reference). Jon Stewart's Kierkegaard's Relation to Hegel Reconsidered (Cambriduge University Press: 2003) states on page 6 quotes the Danish professor Søe's History of Philosophy from Renaissance to the Present as stating that "[Hegel] is the main presupposition for ... the view of modern life in Nazi Germany" (fourth edition, p. 137). 

This seems pretty dubious to me. Intuitive means depending on intuitions, but that would be closer to say Reed's common sense philosophy or the empiricists than to Kierkegaard or Sartre (I don't know too much about Camus). 

From what I gather, there's not too much argument in the rights/freedoms side. If you give people the right to have sex with whom they will and to contract with whom they will, that the state has little interest or position in managing who adopts whom. Or to put it another way, you're going to have to go the full distance and say gay sex is immoral to make a rights argument against legal recognition of gay relationships. Or for gay adoption, you're going to have to show specific harm as to why it among other forms is unacceptable. Thus, the majority of the argument has been about whether a natural law (here merely meaning an account of society and the family informed by something in nature) would allow for gay marriage and gay adoption. The primary text I'm aware of making the against allowing gay marriage and gay adoption is Robert George at Princeton Univeristy, Ryan Anderson, and Sherif Gergis, What is Marriage?. I don't know the exact details of the argument but it builds a case that there's a specific social benefit to privileging and enshrining the natural family of man, woman, and children in law and giving it benefits, and that other relationships do not merit this privileging. (Actually, Hegel makes a similar argument in Philosophy of Right "The Family" and such arguments (well or poorly made are pretty common in the history of Western philosophy)). The argument in terms of natural law in favoring of allowing gay marriage and gay adoption hinges on arguing that the purposes of sex and family have less to do with procreative ability and more to do with creating strong bonds through sex. A primary advocate of this position is John Corvino. 

admittedly, this is the ranting of someone who thinks there are some flaws with Korsgaard's work insofar as it claims to interpret history. 

The Phenomenology of Spirit is at least according to Hegel a preparatory work that is not a part of Encyclopedic system of philosophy (which he explains in detail in two different versions). The system is supposed to explain everything in all of its details and with a certain type of necessity (Hegel is coincidentally an originator of the idea of historical progress towards a necessary future). I'm not sure how much justice I can do to "appropriate", but Hegel follows a basic methodological pattern just about everywhere (you can find one version of how to describe it in Taylor, Hegel, 1975, you can find others in Lauer's Hegel's Idea of Philosophy (1983)). The basic pattern runs something like this: 

In general, this is not held to be the case. Where this is some disagreement is whether our logic has anything to do with the world. Most philosophers think so. Some, like Richard Rorty, think that this is nothing more than a game we're playing, and we could be playing a different one, i.e. it's a self-contained novel of sorts. This is a big feature in some post-Modernisms.
