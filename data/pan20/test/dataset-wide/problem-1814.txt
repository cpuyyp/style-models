I have OpenFiler storage server. Without installing Windows and MSM, I want to create raid10 array from disks 2 to 21. I have already successfully installed MegaCli to OpenFiler but I'm stuck in figuring out the correct command line for creating a raid 10 array. The documentations says that the syntax for creating a raid 10 is: 

The users of a Windows Server 2003 terminal server should be able to use their national identity card (a smart card) inside the terminal session. This requires the Remote Desktop Connection's [x] Smart Cards checkbox to be checked. Unfortunately (for us), when they have their card in the reader and connect using Remote Desktop and that checkbox is checked (so that they can use the card inside the terminal session), they are "greeted" with PIN prompt instead of username and password prompt. They can click Cancel or press Esc every time and log in with username and password but is it possible to get rid of that PIN prompt without losing smart card support inside the terminal session (so that they can still authenticate themselves in a browser inside the terminal session)? 

I have a PostgreSQL database (OLTP, 10GB in size) server and I'm planning an array of hdds for it's storage. I have various disks I can use. I need to find the best ones for the job with the right kind of RAID configuration. What to look? IOPS, MB/s, 4k/512k, what queue depth? What tools to use for measuring (and in which configuration)? It's a virtual machine so I can use the Performance tab and esxtop, too, if they provide some useful information for the task. 

How to add TDS (knowledge about MS SQL Server packets' structure) support for tshark? Currently, the situation is this: 

I'm creating a shared storage server for ESX servers. The storage server is 2U Supermicro 24-bay rackmount server with 12x32GB Intel X25-e SSDs and 12x600GB Toshiba 10k SAS drives. Both SSDs and SAS drives are configured as RAID10 arrays which appear to the OS (Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS) as big virtual drives. The RAID controller has a battery backup unit. The SSD array would be "fast" datastore and the SAS array would be "big" datastore. I'm not yet decided whether I will use NFS or ISCSI. I will try both and decide based on my assessment of the performance and ease of handling differences ratio. The question is: which filesystem to use for "fast" and which for "big" and which mount options? 

We need to make those Megaraid drives available to ESX(i) servers, as datastores, via FCoE. I googled around and found no guides how to achieve that. There seems to be a fcoe-utils package in Ubuntu but having installed that, reading the man and trying something logical like creating an instance of FCoE took me only this far: 

We recently migrated from Exchange 2003 to 2010. Half of our Outlook users are using Outlook from terminal server which is in the same domain as Exchange. The other half of Outlooks are installed on laptops which are not on domain. They usually use OpenVPN to connect to Exchange (and also to other services) but occasionally, when they are located somewhere where there are most outgoing ports blocked (hotels mostly), they use OutlookAnywhere. We have 2 certificates: one for 'ourexchangeserver', self-signed, and other for '*.ourexternaldomain.tld', signed by StartCom. By opening EMC > Server Configuration > Exchange Certificates, we can assign IMAP, POP, SMTP and IIS services to a given certificate. The problem is that RPC also seems to use this same certificate. So when we assign the wildcard certificate to IIS, we can access OWA externally without any security alerts but Outlooks display a security alert that host name is invalid (does not match the issued to field on the presented certificate). When we assign the self-signed certificate to IIS, it's the other way around: Outlooks don't complain but browser displays the same security alert when visiting OWA. My certificate provider (StartCom) does not allow me to generate a certificate issued to a host with missing or nonexistent domain part. Would it be possible to configure Exchange 2010 with these 2 certificates so that OWA would present the public certificate and RPC traffic would be covered with the self signed certificate? 

We recently needed to add more RAM to our vCenter Server (Dell PowerEdge 860 server). We checked from the Kingston memory search what kind of memory the server accepted. Then we found a listing of 4x 2GB DDR2-667 PC2-5300 ECC Registered Memory HP ProLiant DL180 G5 240-PIN on eBay. This looked like it would work. But when we received the sticks and sticked the sticks in, the server just beeped. Here's how the sticks look like: 

When I create a new Outlook profile and re-add POP account, Outlook starts to redownload old messages from POP server if Outlook had previously configured with "Leave messages on server" setting. This occurs even when the very same PST file is used as message store. I would like to know, where does Outlook keep the information associated with "Leave messages on the server" setting. And if there is a way to "cheat" Outlook into thinking that it has already downloaded these mails (when I use the same PST from it's older install instance). 

After attaching a ISCSI target to ESXi 4.1 U1, we saw that ESXi created a 740,25 GB partition onto the LUN, even though the device has 2,7 TB capacity. Why did ESXi not create a bigger vmfs partition? How to fix it? 

How would one see conveniently which users exactly have which permissions on a folder when a folder's Security tab has many usergroups? I'm specifically looking for some technique or a GUI/CLI tool which lists individual users and their permissions for the folder. I googled and checked out DumpSec and Hyena but they didn't seem to have an option to dump individual users. 

I have a server with 3 hard drives: one System Drive and two drives in RAID1 for data. Raid1 is done via Intel Storage Matrix software. Today Intel Storage Matrix said that array is degraded and must be rebuilt. I clicked rebuild array. After that I was no longer near this server. When I got back I was told that the process had finished but since they noticed that other computers could longer access the shared folders on the server, they restarted the server. After I logged back in, the data drive was gone for Windows (D: was now CDROM). And the Intel Storage Matrix Console showed a different picture: the little cross on red circle had gone away from "Port 0: INTEL SSDSA2M040G2GC" and this Port0 itself had moved from under "RAID Hard Drives" to "Non-RAID Hard Drives". When Intel Matrix Storage Console is opened, it asks if I want to reset hard drives to non-raid drives: 

Can someone explain why these stick don't work in PowerEdge 860? I.e. bring out the reason what exactly makes them incompatible with this server? Is it because these sticks are not unbuffered as Kingston told they should be? Or are they? How to tell? 

When I put a crossover cable between physical box and a laptop and witnessed excellent speed and then put a switch between and the speed was still great and then changed the IP addresses from 192.168.0.x to real IP addressses that I had for the physical box and the VM, it occurred to me that while the ESX and physical box are just over the switch for each other, their different IP subnets dictate that all traffic shared between them has to go through the ISP router which is also connected to the same switch. So, due to different subnets, the traffic went through my ISP's box which shaped it down to 100Mbps! 

We have an installerless program which we want to set up for Windows 2003 terminal server users so that they can just double click it's file extension and that program will open that file by default. Is there any tool or a clear step-by-step guide for doing this? 

This problem is caused by the fact that this Ubuntu installation has been installed by pressing F4 at the very first screen during the install and choosing Install a minimal virtual machine. Probably due to a habit of installing it usually on virtual machines :-). Because of that fact, network intefaces can be inaccessible, remote keyboarding (through IPMIviewer or similar iKVM) and booting system without the help of installation CD (by using the Boot from the hard disk option) might not work. The solutions are the following: 

I'm trying to create an All-in-one box which consists of ESXi running from an USB stick. Inside of ESXi there will be a vm which has been given direct access to a RAID controller for sharing it's disks via ISCSI back to this underlying ESXi server and also to other ESXi servers on the network. I'm following the guide posted here $URL$ I purchased a 32GB USB stick for the system and storage vm's data files. The system (ESXi) installs fine onto the stick but after installation there is no datastore and rescanning for one does not reveal one either so I cannot install the storage vm. How to make USB thumbdrive space visible as a datastore to ESXi 4.1 U1? 

A customer has a rack with some 1U servers and Dell™ PowerConnect™ 2716 switch at ISP's server room. One port is uplink to the ISP. Some servers run ESX5 while one 1U server is a plain Windows 2008 R2 box with 2 nics. The switch allows me to use web based interface but there are no mrtg style graphs available to monitor bandwidth (ab)usage. There have been 2 occasions where the whole 100Mbps that we have given by the ISP, is fully under load and we have only our gut feeling to determine if the slowness is caused by the server or the network. So far we have been solving problems with this gut feeling but before we rush to the shop buying expensive Cisco gear, I'd like to know if I could take advantage of the switch's port mirror feature and mirror the uplink port to a port in switch from which I could pull a cable to the secondary nic on the physical plain Windows box and do some network traffic analysis on that plain box (by using promiscuous mode and some software to make statistics). What would be the software that I could use on the box in order to easily see: 1) How big the total network load is on the uplink port. 2) How it is distributed among IPs/MACs 

I need to create a new mailing list in Exchange 2010 which would consist of about 50 external email addresses. I have the list of (external) email addresses in plain text format. I have previously solved this task by manually creating an external contact for each email address and then adding those external contacts to a distribution group. What would be the most efficient way to solve this task with Exchange 2010? Does EMS help here? 

Seems that I should not use E and S letters. At first I understood correctly and tried it letterlessly but also got invalid token errors because I was using -aALL instead of -a0 ("If you have only one controller it’s safe to use ALL instead of a specific ID"), and then read from this site that "E is the enclosure device ID in which the drive resides and S the slot number" and hence concluded that I should replace E and S with actual IDs. :( 

I am building a small setup of ESX5 servers. There will be different apps running for different companies on them. Each company has a VM that has one Internet facing vNIC and one vNIC facing to this company's private virtual network (backend). The backend networks are for separate web server and database VMs. The question is: would it be performance and/or security wise better to create a separate virtual switch for each company or just use VLAN tags? I mean if all the private networks are load-wise fully utilized, would it make a difference if they used separate virtual switches? 

CAN I USE FASTER RATED STICKS THAN THE BOARD IS RATED FOR? Generally all DDR is backward compatible and can run at any bus speed slower than it is rated to run. For example if your PC has a 266MHz FSB (Front Side Bus), you will need PC2100 266MHz DDR. If your PC has a 266MHz FSB, you can use PC2100 266MHz or PC2700 333MHz DDR. All PCs that accept PC2100 DDR will also accept PC2700 DDR; however your memory will only run as fast as the slowest link in your system. If you have a PC2100 266MHz FSB or any PC2100 modules installed, any PC2700 333MHz modules that you install will only operate at 266MHz. PC2700 DDR does not offer any immediate benefit over PC2100 DDR if you have a 266MHz FSB. However, if you are planning to upgrade to a system with a 333MHz FSB in the future, you may be able to use the PC2700 modules you purchase now, in your future system. HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED PARITY, NON-PARITY, OR ECC, NON-ECC MEMORY? The general rule of thumb in deciding what type of memory you need is to look at what’s already installed in your system. To find out if you have ECC, parity, or non-ECC, non-parity memory, count the number of chips on the module. Divide the total number of chips by three. If you can evenly divide the number of chips by three, the module is ECC or parity, if not, then it is a non-ECC, non-parity module. If you"re building a PC and plan to use your system as a server or a similar mission critical type machine, it is to your advantage to use ECC. If you plan to use your PC for regular home, office, or gaming application, you are better off with non-ECC, non-parity memory. HOW TO TELL ECC, PARITY MEMORY FROM NON-ECC, NON- PARITY MEMORY? If your system has ECC or parity memory the chips are evenly divisible by three. How do you know which one you have? One way is to look at the part numbers on the chips of your module. If each chip has the same part number, you have ECC. If one chip is different, you have parity. WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ECC, PARITY AND NON-ECC, NON-PARITY? ECC (error checking and correcting) memory performs double bit detection and single bit correction. This means that if you have a single bit memory error, the chipset and memory will find and repair the error on the fly without you knowing that it happened. If you have a double bit memory error, it will detect and report it. Non-ECC, non-parity memory, on the other hand, has no error detection and correction capabilities. Using ECC decreases your PCs performance by about 2%. Current technology DRAM is very stable and memory errors are rare, so unless you have a need for ECC, you are better served with non-ECC, non-parity memory. CAN I MIX AND MATCH ECC, PARITY AND NON-ECC, NON-PARITY? When adding new memory, you need to match what is already in your system. Parity modules have an extra chip that detects if data was correctly read or written by the memory module, depending on the type of error. However, a parity module will not correct the error. ECC modules can detect double bit errors and correct single bit errors. Most motherboards that do not have an ECC function within the BIOS are still able to use a module with ECC, but the module will run in non-ECC mode. Keep in mind, there are some cases where the motherboard will not accept an ECC module, depending on the BIOS programming. The only sure-fire way to test this is to place the module in the motherboard and see if the BIOS will recognize the memory addition. WHAT DOES BUFFERED MEMORY MEAN? Buffering (applies only to old EDO and FPM memory) is the process of re-driving the signals through the memory chips. It allows the modules to be built with more chips. With buffering there is no loss of performance. The design of the computer memory controller dictates whether EDO/FPM RAM must be buffered or unbuffered. HOW DO I KNOW IF THE EDO/FPM MODULE IS BUFFERED You can determine if the EDO/FPM module is buffered by looking at the leads next to the first notch. If the leads are evenly spaced, the module is buffered. If the leads are not evenly spaced (a larger PCB area next to the lead) the module is unbuffered. WHAT DOES REGISTERED MEMORY MEAN? The term registered applies to modern (DDR) SDRAM and also refers to how the memory module processes signals. Registered modules contain a register chip that delays all information transferred to the module by 1 clock cycle. Because the registering process takes one clock cycle, registered modules are slightly slower than non-registered modules. This type of memory is primarily used in servers and was designed for modules with 32 or more chips on them to help ensure that data is properly handled. Most PCs will only accept unregistered SDRAM. WHAT DOES UNBUFFERED MEMORY MEAN? For EDO/FPM memory it means that the memory is not buffered. For SDRAM modules it means that the memory is not registered. CAN I MIX UNBUFFERED WITH BUFFERED EDO/FPM? Buffered and unbuffered EDO/FPM memory chips cannot be mixed and they even use slightly different printed circuit boards (PCB’s): If you try to install the wrong type, the first notch on the bottom of the module will be offset. CAN I MIX UNBUFFERED WITH REGISTERED (DDR) SDRAM? You can't install unbuffered (unregistered) SDRAM modules along with registered modules at the same time. WHAT IS CAS LATENCY? CAS latency (also referred to as latency) is the amount of time it takes for your memory to respond to a command. Specifically, it is the length of time between memory receiving a command to read data, and the first piece of data being output from memory. Latency is measured in terms of clock cycles and is often noted as CL2 (two clock cycles) or CL3 (three clock cycles). PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CL2 AN CL3 CL2 parts process data a little quicker than CL3 parts in that you have to wait one less clock cycle for the initial data. However, after the first piece of data is processed, the rest of the data is processed at equal speeds. Latency only affects the initial burst of data. Once data starts flowing, there is no affect. Bear in mind, a clock cycle for a PC100 module is a 10 nanoseconds so you probably won’t notice a significant performance difference. Most systems will accept either latency part. However, there are some systems that require either CL2 or CL3 parts. CAN CL2 AND CL3 PARTS BE MIXED? CL2 and CL3 parts can be mixed. BIOS settings should reflect the CL3 setting, as the CL2 module will run at the CL3 setting when it is installed with a CL3 module. CAN YOU MIX AND MATCH MODULES OF DIFFERENT SIZES? Different sizes of SDRAM modules can be mixed together. In other words, you can use 32MB, 64MB, 128MB, and 256MB together. Keep in mind, the largest module should always be placed in the first slot for best performance. The exception to this rule is systems that require memory to be installed in banks of two or more. For example, some systems require modules to be installed in banks of two. In this case, the two modules in each bank need to be the same size. If your system had two banks of two, (four slots), you could install two 32MB modules in bank 0 and two 64MB in bank 1. Your total memory would then be 192MB. DOES IT MATTER WHICH SLOTS THE MEMORY IS INSTALLED IN? In general, you will get the best performance if you put the largest module (in megabytes) in the lowest-numbered slot. For example, if your computer comes with 32MB of removable memory and you want to add 128MB, it would be best to put the 128MB into slot 0 and the 32MB module into slot 1. Read more from: $URL$
