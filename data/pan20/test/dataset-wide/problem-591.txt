Bangalore, India Regular buses do not allow cycles, especially since the door is too small to take it through. Ac-buses are supposed to allow you to take your cycle. You will be charged an extra 'luggage' fee which keeps changing so I shan't bother mentioning it. However, during peak times conductors will often disallow you due to lack of space. If you want to travel by bus, try doing so in the early morning or early afternoon. Metros do allow cycles 

This happens everytime one replaces a component of the drivetrain since the original cable position is rarely restored. He needs to do something called indexing the gears. It is a common procedure and there are many good tutorials online explaining how to do it much better than I could. Here is one I'd trust- 

First, you should understand how suspensions with lockouts work. Fluid suspensions(oil or air) like yours have a valve inside them that lets the fluid flow through at a constricted rate on the way up, and very quickly on the way down. This is what gives the dampening effect on suspensions. Lockouts effectively completely close off that valve. However, obviously the valve is not infinitely strong. At some point, it will give way and let the air through. This is where blow-offs come in. Blow-off basically refers to that point where the lockout 'fails' and dampens the shock anyway. The model you have has something called TurnKey which is Rock Shox patented name for blow-off. It has an adjustable blow-off point which will let you set the amount of force required for the blow-off to occur. Now that you know how these systems work, consider your case of riding your MTB as a BMX on a track. If you set the turnkey/blowoff too low, you'll risk it suddenly dropping on a big landing and if you are taking a turn or something immediately after, you can risk losing your balance. If you set it too high, you probably can damage the valve in the shocks by stressing it too much. So to conclude, not really, riding on the lockout won't affect the suspension too much because as soon as the wheel hits something too hard, the lockout will 'fail' and go back to normal damping as long as you don't set the blow-off so high that it is practically impossible to hit the bow-off. Just don't set it so low you hit the drop-off all the time and defeat the point of locking out. 

A cyclist I know who went down the bluetooth route experienced connectivity issues. He eventually gave up and went with ANT+ and a dedicated GPS device. 

If they are steady on their feet and tall enough than a balance bike is fine. The advantage of a balance bike is it develops balance first as small children don't necessarily have the strength or co-ordination to ride a pedal bike to begin with. We found the wooden balance bikes to be inherently bigger - so for our child we went with the much smaller dimensions the aluminium balance bikes. 

Not only will this stress your frame - it may also fatigue the frame. And may cause sudden and catastrophic failure. 

That looks like the quick release mechanism used when removing the tyre to open the caliper a little wider. It looks broken? - it should be tucked under in line with the pull of the cable. Since it isn't the cable is actually pulling the release open as you brake. You might be able to temporarily remedy it by leaving it in the open position and pulling the cable tighter. You would however lose the use of the quick release. Probably not a great idea to run it like this - since the cable will be pulling on the fixing nut at a strange angle. Best replace with a new caliper. 

Measure the rim in a more accurate way for starters. Even 0.1mm can cause a change in the braking power. Also, with the bike resting on its handles and seat, flipped over, ask someone to lightly hold down the front brake while you slowly turn the wheel and figure out exactly where the trouble spot is and how big it is. If there is no visible difference, and you don't have the means to measure the rim more accurately, then it probably is the width of the rim being uneven. On the other hand if you find that it does not occur at the same spot every time, maybe the problem is elsewhere. If you can, see if the width of the rim changes radially, fatter near the tire and thinner near the spokes. If the difference in this width isn't constant, it could be causing the problem 

You will have to decide the worthwhileness of the project for yourself. Money wise it won't cost much more than $50 (~20 for the seat, and the rest for brake pads and other implements like WD-40 if you don't have them). I would personally do it less to save money but more for the learning that would be gained from doing it. But the importance given to learning experiences differ from person to person and its up to you 

No reason to keep it off while riding. In fact it is suggested to always have it on while riding because it reduces noise, chain slap and the possibility of the chain coming off. 

My answer assumes that you've correctly set the sag of your fork. You need to have 15%, 20% or 25% of sag depending on your riding style and trail types you usually ride. If not, then go ahead and fix that first. You can also remove most of the air from the fork (just leave 5 PSI) and see if it gets full travel (by pressing down statically), just for making sure that it does work. Then reinflate to correct pressure. 

If you like going fast and flowy on very rough terrain then your knees will have a lot of work to do. Feet and knees will get more tired. Whether they are injured depends on how long you'll keep pushing in that situation. Regarding injuries from falls, you'll fall more (than having a full susp.) only if you don't slow down a bit in order to compensate for the nervousness and instability of the hardtail when going fast in rough terrain. 

GPS may be accurate +/- 15 meteres. $URL$ If you have a GPS device with barometric measurement - then this can improve. Should you be worried? If you're using it for cycling then probably not - it is only an indicative figure of metres gained or lost. If you're trying to land a plane - then yes. :) 

Taken from the Team Sky nutritionist's recommendations. Although it is for breakfast the guidelines for what to look for in your pre-race diet still stand. 

viewing the screen in bright sunlight can be an issue most phones are not waterproof/water resistant robustness aesthetically - not the most pleasing when mounted on a bar or stem 

$URL$ This link might be helpful. It describes only two grades of alloy for their current bikes. The higher grade being hydroformed. Hydroforming allows profiling and shaping of the tubes. Its comparative to blow moulding. With respect to then older tubesets - I seem to remember the differences being grade and butting. The higher end frames using lighter tubesets and triple butted. Most bike manufacturers in those days bought in their high end tubes from possibly the likes of Easton. 

Get a new seat and seat post. Ride the bike and see if anything sounds or feels amiss. Places to look out for are the moving arts like headset(handle), the drive train and the brakes. The drive train seems to be in prime condition except for rust. Spray some WD-40 or equivalent rust remover on anything thats rusty and make sure you wipe off the extra cleanly. Then lube the whole drive train. Your brakes will need replacing for sure, best not to take risks with safety. 

Presta Valves, or any valve for that matter do not leak after you have taken the pump head off. The valve should automatically close even without you having to screw down the valve. Doing that only applies pressure on the valve to reduce leakage over time even further. If the valve keeps leaking till you screw it down means that there is some damage in the rubber of the tube valve. Where I live we can actually buy just the tube valve, disassemble the presta valve and replace the tube which might be damaged. However, that requires some experience and a tube valve which you are unlikely to find. Your best bet is to just buy a new tube. Sidenote: Even on a new/fixed tube you will always have some very small leakage when you pull the pump head off. This is because that little pin that gets pressed down(that's what opens the valve and allows air in) when you put the head on has to come back up and that only happens as fast as you can take the head off. So don't be alarmed if you hear a short hiss when you pull the head off. To reduce it, try pulling the head in one clean jerk but it really wouldn't change much compared to the total volume of the tire 

Personally, if your road frame is an out-and-out road bike - I would say you will be faced with several issues. 

Of the two varieties of winter tights - padded or unpadded - I prefer the unpadded because it allows for better layering with your favourite padded bib shorts. The tights your have - err towards the unpadded variety and without actually seeing the level of padding - I would guess a pair of padded shorts should be worn with them. Proper cycling lycra should not be worn with underwear as this would chaff and irritate. 

I've used Cif or Jif as it used to be called. Its a cream bathroom and kitchen surface cleaner. Works wonders. 

The other option available to the OP is to buy a helicoil kit to fix the damaged threads or switch to a square taper BB to which there are special BBs available to run on a damaged thread. 

50/34 with and 11/32 on the rear is going to be very spinny. For me - the range is too wide and the gaps between the gears too big. But - this depends on the kind of riding you will be doing. If you are riding the very steepest of mountains - than the 34/32 combination might be what you are looking for. Purely for fast road work - that's too wide a combination (for my personal taste). The other thing you will have to consider is the rear mech. For such a wide range you will need to go with a mid or long cage rear mech. I don't think it will work with a standard short cage. However, I have used 50/34 with 11/28 on a short cage - and that has been OK. Try the Sheldon Brown gear calculator to work out the combination which will work for you. $URL$ 

Good epoxy is known to bond metals, especially aluminum very well. Make sure the surfaces are clean and slightly rough for a better bond. I use the same two part epoxy hobbyist aircraft builders use for fixing pretty much anything, including broken ceramic mugs, small broken metal things and even as an insulator on the bottom of PCBs to prevent any shorts. When looking for replacement cable stops try to get something with a solid base and not hollow so you can glue the whole thing down. From the looks of it the original was only glues around the edge which is probably why it came of. Another solution could be solder. It will be stronger but look a little asymmetrical, but as long as you do it to the other cable stop too it should look fine. It melts at a low enough temperature for nothing to happen to the heat treatment of the aluminum. I take no responsibility for the frame if you do this however, it's only my guess, and is completely untested. Would like some input by someone who knows a little more about solder and hest treated aluminum about this solution, it seems workable 

No saddles exist which are unsafe for mens' health. What exists are saddles which do not fit particular bodies and, most importantly, misconfigured saddles and bad riding postures which can give a man some health issues. 

practice in steeps smaller in length practice in steeps with smaller angle watch someone at your riding level do that steep first 

These are downhill MTB specific tyres. The extended side knobs will fully engage when cornering hard. By hard I mean: 

It's called a chain ring and, yes, it can be changed to whatever you want it. $URL$ The dirt bike above has cranks which seem to use chainrings of type 104mm bcd 4-bolt. So any 104 bcd chainring will do the job. E.g: $URL$ 

The reason racers sometimes pedal out of corners is unrelated to grip. They do this in order to maximize the exit speed, especially in case they didn't corner perfectly (probably tapped the brakes) and lost momentum. 

No reason at all. NWD10 is a classic old school movie. You don't see purposeless skidding like that in today's MTB movies nor do you see it in real life MTB riding. Kirt Voreis (the guy in that scene - legendary rider) is probably doing this for no reason, just for fun, or at least what used to be fun in these old times. 

A stronger and better riding wheel is gained from a more even spoke tension. Might be an idea to take the wheel to a get it re-tensioned. ie. slacking off the tension on the wheel and then re-tensioning and truing. High speed wobble is a bit of an enigma. Given the speed you were travelling - 40mph - the wheel would be spinning at about 500RPM. The slightest deformation or imbalance in the wheel or tyre could easily cause a "wobble". Given your mention of uneven tension - it could be this with the combination of speed and rider could introduce deformations in the wheel as it spins. Hypothesis... As the wheel spins - it is the top-most spokes at the 12'O clock position which are under most load. Those are the 6'O clock position are in least loaded position. If you have uneven spoke tension - I imagine the rim at 6'O clock will be flexing a little more than normal - ie. deformation.
