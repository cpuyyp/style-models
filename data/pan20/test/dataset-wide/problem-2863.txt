The answer,unfortunately is yes because although the "Scientific Method"is not anything religious, the crossover is the similarity between Scolasticism (in theology) and Academicism in institutions that should not be religious but should be devoted to scientific pursuit for the simple fact that the definition of Empiricism is in conflict with Academicism. REFERENCES: Hume, Acquinas, Plato but all from a critical examination of Empiricism, Scolasticism and Academicism (respectively). Any text in criticism of Western Philosophy should suffice. 

A. P. French wrote in 1971 in his book "Newtonian Mechanics", page 317 and figure 9-4, that if you consider a gun firing particles analogous to photons at a barrier some distance away, that since the photon-like objects cannot be seen, there is the appearance that Newton's third law does not apply until it is absorbed by the barrier. Scientifically we say that photons have momentum, and we could measure it anywhere along the path from the gun to the barrier, however the issue is that a photon does not take a quantifiable state until such an absorption occurs. That is to say, it defers to the philosophical question of "Where are photons between emission and absorption?" (Which does not have a precise philosophical answer in the context of the double-slit experiment). 

Well here's the thing: You assume "universe" is both the physical universe and a simulation thereof at the same time. You have to pick one. For example, if you are in a simulation you really need to apply computer science, which is all finite with the exception of a Turing Machine. If you are in the "physical" universe, you have to solve the metaphysical question of why physical law is universal, which on it's face appears to imply a finite space. There isn't even the slightest reason to make physical law universal inside an engineered simulation, in fact this is what you imply. So basically you are discussing "physical law", which (from Contemporary Debates in the Philosophy of Science, 2004, Christopher Hitchcock, editor) section 0.2.3, where "law" implies regularity, which, again, is what you seek to undermine. There is no accepted evidence for non-regularity. 

The rest frame of relativity is at rest by definition. More concretely the COBE experiment shows the earth's velocity relative to the visible universe as a whole taken as a rest frame beyond which no other larger frame is known. 

Why do leftists have a broad set of ideals and people on the right also a set of different ideals? Why, generally, do women like romance novels (words) in the same way that men like colorful magazines (pictures)? There are a lot of answers to those questions directly [try Google], but the philosophical point is knowing the context. If you want to write a book with mass appeal about science, you need to leave out the equations. [Forward to "A Brief History of Time"], but that's just marketing. What you want is to develop is a feeling for a balance of form, function and target audience, or, as Barnett Newmann put it: "Aesthetics is for the artist as Ornithology is for the birds." 

What I'm asking is if is there any possibility for a Non-human Philosophy, that is, a Philosophy founded on questions which we can't even conceive. Is possible a Philosophy of questions which only can be though by God, by advanced civilizations, by machines or IA or, even, by less advanced species of thinking entities like animals or colonies of bacteries? If Philosophy is etymologically love of wisdom, why are we so secure of that we are the only ones that we can love the wisdom by itself? There aren't no possibility for a Philosophy of the noumenonological parts of the Being which we can't conceive, that is, a Noumenological Philosophy based on a reasoning of these entities which we can't understand? 

I answer you categorically yes! It is necessary that the mankind has to continue at all because we are the only ones -as far as we know- who possess those that we call intelligence. There are many reasons to affirm what I say. We can, in fact, find a reason for each branch of knowledge if we search. That's don't mean that the reason you asked is gnoseological, but our action of think on things and act according to our observation gives us a superior grade of dignity than all others known entities in the Universe. This is intelligence is dignity. We are all agreed that human beings has more dignity than other phenomenological entities, but that dignitive superiority of Mankind only can be based on our inteligence because there are no other differences between us and gorillas or other biological beings. So the development of our intellectual act is what gives us reasons to save the Mankind from the inexistence or the dissapearance and it justifies our wish of continuity is not related only to our emotional needs because emotion is a small, non-representative, fraction of the totality of the inteligence. Inteligence consists -in addition to other things- in the knowledge of reality that is, thus we can find reasons to our existence and continuity in the depth of the reality itself through our wisdom. I will give you a practical example of how do it the manner I propose, that is, justify our continuity in our inteligence. I'll show the most intrincate argument that I consider now, the rest are suchlike and not much more difficult. The necessity of the continuity of de Mankind by its necessity of continuity This is the more categorical argument I have found. For the concept of necessity of continuity we need the phenomenological notion of necessity, which is perceived by the human beings and provoked by a noumenological entity, but the necessity itself is something phenomenological -at least what we perceive-. The phenomenon of necessity are captured by human understanding through the intelectual act of perceive the forms of reality adapted to our senses in the experience which we received from the reality via our perception. Thereby if our continuity were contingent to Universe, the concept itself of necessity would be contingent and therefore there aren't necessary entities in the Universe except the concept of contingency, which would be the unique possible concept relative to existenciality with meaning mediated by our thinking. Hence the necessity of beings who postulate the necessity itself, i.e., human beings, is proved by the absolute necessity. Thus our categorical argument prove the necessity of continuity of mankind downright. 

Exactly how bad is attribute A? Is it the case that these people are petty theives, serial rapists, or merely snobby or judgmental? We all agree that qualities like these are bad, but in different levels: while I might complain but ultimately cave to my friend's request to attend a dinner with a bunch of people who are snobby and judgmental, I surely would not cave to a request to go to dinner with a group of serial rapists. There ought to be some notion of how bad A actually is for society (i.e. its consequences) in order for Utilitarianism to effectively solve this problem. Assuming A has highly negative consequences for other people, then we're left at a crossroads. Say we're looking at a group of people who are awful and dangerous drivers - something that is decidedly worse than snobbishness. Lets say that in the source country, thousands of people die each year because of poor driving combined with no safety features in automobiles and poor policing that allows bad drivers to continue running people over. Utilitarianism would say that if we took these people out of this environment, let them harm a few people in our country, which is more well-policed and safety-oriented, and then locked them up for being bad drivers, we'd actually be doing the world a favor. This seems to clash with our intuition about what the "right" thing to do is: many would say that we have no obligation to import these people if many of them will kill our own citizens with automobiles upon coming here. Assuming A has few negative consequences (snobby people don't kill people) then, if coming to the host country will benefit them greatly (say they were starving in their home country), we ought to suck it up and import them. Our discomfort about them being snobby is surely less than what they stand to benefit from coming here. This seems more reasonable than the above but might still rub us the wrong way - are you obligated to help a materially poor yet incredibly rude and obnoxious person? A lot of people would say that you're justified in walking away from a visibly intoxicated homeless person that shouts slurs at you despite the fact that your discomfort about his bad breath and lack of social etiquette is much less uncomfortable than his alcoholism and lack of reliable food and shelter. 

All I can conclude here is that Utilitarianism does a "just ok" job of solving this problem. Basically, the conclusion is that from this perspective, we can't just concern ourselves with how our host country will fare - we must also consider how our actions affect those in the source country as well. In some cases, it may be that despite A being very prevalent and very bad, we're actually helping the world by importing them to a society that will hold them responsible for their evil actions. It's possible that another ethical framework provides a more satisfactory answer (I'd expect deontologists to have an interesting response). I'm not sure if this is the example you were looking for, but it does provide an ethics-based reasoning as to what the best thing to do is. Part of my problem with this question is in handling all the variables - maybe my treatment of some of the variables leads me to this conclusion. Maybe we ought to consider what percent of the migrants would make of the host country upon moving as well?
