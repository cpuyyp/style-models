Unlike for all of the other artificial languages, I know someone in my circle of acquaintances who is actually "speaking" this language to a certain extend; there seems to be a mildly active community that actually uses this conlang. 

Another (subjective) comment on Dominik Lukes' answer: I wouldn't say that both of the distinctions produce more prolbems than they solve. It is crucial to distinguish the expression (the signifier) from its denotation (the signified) - in fact, without that distniction, you wouldn't really be able to do any semantics, if you can't compare a term with its meaning because you assume that they are actually the same. And the notion of intensionality (Sinn as opposed to Bedeutung) has had a huge impact on semantic theory, most of which I find not too implausible. For example, how would you account for propositional attitudes like "John knows that grass is green" if you are not able to distinguish between the general sense of an expression and its reference in a specific situation? You clearly can not just restrict yourself to extension, because then, as long as John knows something that is true, everything with the same extension would automatically be in the set of things he knows - and clearly, John won't know everything that is true just because he knows one thing that is true, but this is exactly what you would get if you assumed that there is nothing more of a meaning to an expression than its denotation in the actual world. And how would you do modal logic, if you can not talk about possible worlds? There would be no way to account for notions like possibility or necessity, which I think is not unimportant to talk about in both linguistics and related fields like philosophy. On the other hand, you can also not just restrict yourself to just the sense of an expression - knowing what must in general be the case for it to become true or to have an idea of what properties apply to it doesn't help much if you aren't able to compute its meaning (its denotation) in an actual world; you woldn't be able to make simple judgements as "It is true that the sun is shining" in a close to systematic way if you have no way to account for the actual meaning in a given situation of something that was said. I would claim that sense and denotation can indeed been told apart to a certain degree, and when there are two different concepts, there should be two different names. So although such notions are of course always hard to capture, I really wouldn't say that the distinction brings more disadvantages than benefits. But probably this is something one can have a lot of different opinions about. 

It needs to be learnt in a fast amount of time, and be very, VERY easy but still not lacking things. This is especially true since you will need to capture large amounts of monolingual speakers, for example most English-speakers. The average person from the USA doesn't even feel like they have enough time in the day to cook dinner "from scratch" (I've even heard complaints about how "it takes such a long time for water to boil for my instant ramen"), but at the same time English speakers pride themselves on the small nuances that come in word pairs like "handrail, banister, balustrade", and often believe that other languages don't have them. So the constructed language has to heavily cater to both of these aspects. There needs to be proof that the language works and that people speak it. Meaning, before you even publish the book that teaches it, set up a forum for it, translate material and write original material in it, have some audio recordings, etc. People already say things like "you're learning Icelandic? WHY?" because they believe it's useless and there's nothing worthwhile in it, so you have to combat this very strongly starting from the very beginning. 

You need to be careful about syntax and semantics: is a variable, i.e. some string of symbols, and and are formulas, i.e. also just some strings of symbols. Syntactically, does occur in both of the formulas. It is also not meaningful to say that something is an element of (the interpretation of) because is a formula which evaluates to a truth condition, or is not something a variable or an individual could be an element of. What you want to say is that the tuples and are not talking about the same element, i.e., the denotation of for the first tuple is not necessarily an element of the denotation of the second tuple and vice versa. 

You can get online news and bloggers to write about it, you can ask indie companies about putting some words of it on their CD cases and organic soy milk, etc. Basically it has to somehow reach the mass public without them in any way actually looking for it. 

Ease of learning, reading, and pronunciation. Therefore there can't be consonant clusters (imagine Russian), or sounds not in most languages (ex. English's þ, ð, and w, the distinction in its two l sounds, or its many vowels), and the alphabet/syllabary should look distinct even if the person hasn't learnt it yet (ex. katakana, runes, hobo symbols, or most of the roman letters - not Arabic, Braille or kanji). This is not just so that the language doesn't feel impossible, but also to help hard-of-seeing people and dyslexic people who recognize letters slightly more based on "shape" (it's hard to explain, but telling the difference between o and 0, or n and h in bad handwriting, can be very hard for example). 

Traditionally, a morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of language. Under this assumption, every morpheme is meaningful by defnition. However, this is not always that simple. The definition works well for most of both free and bound morphemes - definitely, free morphemes such as dog, run, red are meaningful, affxies like -ize (verbalisation), -ed (past tense marker), un- (opposite marker) can claimed to have a clearly identifiable meaning and even morphemes that have a status somewhere in between free and bound, such as confixes (like fanat- in fanat-ic or polit- in polit-ics, polit-ical, polit-ician, which never occur freely but can combine to standalone-words together with affixes, which affixes among each other can not) do. But then there are special cases like the so-called cranberry morphemes. The cran- in cranberry never occurs alone but is not a classical affix either, yet it does create a unique meaning in combination with berry. Is the morpheme cran- now meaningful itself, when it only ever creates a meaning with one particular morpheme in combination? I would say yes, because it contributes to the menaning of the newly formed word in a systematic way, but this is not as clear as for the usual free and bound morphemes. Another problematic kind of morpheme are circumfixes. German computes the past participle form of most verbs with the circumfix ge-STEM-t (e.g. tanzen -> tanz- -> ge-tanz-t). In combination, ge-X-t certainly is meaningful - but what about the single moprhemes ge- and -t, are they really meaningful individually? Or are they not morphemes at all? I would bluff it out by saying that only ge- and -t taken together are a morpheme and ge- in isolation simply isn't one, but that is probably not the most elegant way to put it. The case I find one the most interesting in this respect are the so-called interfixes (not to be confused with infixes) already mentioned in curiousdannii's answer. An English example would be -o- in words such as speed-o-meter, or the already mentioned -i- in human-i-form. In German (where they are usually called "Fugenmorpheme"), such interfixes frequently occur between two morphemes in compounds and derivates such as Jäger-s-mann (huntsman) or Arbeit-s-platz (workplace) and it is very difficult to tell what it actually is. It is definitely NOT an inflectional morpheme (like a genitive or plural marker), as is often assumed, because Arbeits- nowhere occurs in the inflectional paradigm of Arbeit. But it does not seem to have any identifiable meaning either, you could as well leave it away and would not change the meaning of the word (just that it would sound weird because the word is simply in the lexicon like this); it is assumed that it is mostly there for phonotactic reasons (like easier pronounciation or better contrast between similarly sounding phonemes). Due to the latter, one might even claim that it is not a morpheme at all, but what is it then? Morphological analysis should be able to segmentize a word into all of its immediate constituents, Arbeit and Platz clearly are the smallest meaningful units and it is very unpleasent to have something in between that is merely a phoneme but morphologically not identifiable at all. So one might want to give up the above definition and go with a more carful, but also less explanatory one like the minimal unit relevant to morphological and syntactic analysis. This does not make any claims about meaningfulness, but then again it is kind of circular, because morphological analysis needs to rely on what a morpheme is (which we now defined as what is treated by morphological analysis), so there is no much gain in choosing such a rather loose definiton. All in all, I would claim that the vast majority morphemes are meaningful, and not only free morphemes, but also bound ones (like -ize) or rarer cases like confixes or cranberry morphemes, because they do contribute to the meaning of a word in a systematic, i.e. compositional and predictable way. However, at least for the presumably merely phonologically originated Fugenmorpheme and possibly also some other special cases, it seems like some morphemes indeed do not have any inherent meaning at all, neither in isolation nor in combination with other morphemes. My answer to the question would thus be no, not all morphemes are meaningful, knowing that this impairs the classical and actually intuitive definition of a morpheme as "the minimal meaningful unit of language" heavily. 

Unfortunately, my sources for this are in Swedish and/or from old periodicals from the actual time when Esperanto was new, so I can't link anything. If you can read Swedish, find the book called "100 years of Esperanto", and in Esperanto there's another book you can try, "La Esperanto-Movado en Upsalo" (as I remember the title). Basically what happened is, the book first came out in Russian, and from there people just found it as something amusing or interesting to do in their free time. That's how it spread very minorly to other countries, through bilingual people who translated it. Once it got to Germany, some people who had visited Germany and who were students at the University of Uppsala noticed it and decided to not only form a club (there was also a German club at this time, but it was the only club in the world I think) but also, when they heard that Esperanto was starting to be banned in Russia/a Russian Esperanto periodical was closed down, they started their own which grew to be very big and influental in the first few beginning years. (Swedes are easily outraged about injusticies so honestly that's probably why they started it, also Uppsala is very well-known for being a "linguistic research capital".) They managed to get funding from people outside of Sweden, among other things, and used it to distribute flyers (they also got flyers from Zamenhof himself and wrote to him a lot, asking about stuff). Their periodical was simply called "Lingva Internacia" or something like that, but it included all sorts of stuff, like both local Swedish news and Esperanto news. The club and so on was written about in the Swedish newspapers too, among other things, so that's how it got some more publicity. Basically for about five years, Uppsala was the "capital of the Esperanto world" due to this, and they influenced other groups to start making their own periodicals. I believe the very initial list of potential subscribers was obtained by mailing Zamenhof himself and asking about it. When other countries started having more periodicals and clubs too, they also started being advertised in the countries' local newspapers - this was sometimes in a normal news-y way, but other times the members actually paid for advertising in the hopes that it would make new members; this was a very expensive thing to do at the time. This doesn't mean that the clubs or periodicals were any big (it only takes two people to form a club!). Don't forget that this is also a time when you did normal advertising in the newspaper, so anyone looking for an Esperanto penpal or teacher would likely use the newspaper to place the ad. It was also possible to subscribe to periodicals even if you lived abroad, so ex. there were French readers of the English Esperanto periodical. Of course, this was also a different time from today, where it was extremely normal to try out new things and different clubs and so on. It seems like most of the people simply heard about the language from friends or from various newspaper articles about it. A lot of people simply told even strangers they met about it (ex. on the train). Even back in the 1920's and earlier though, there were elementary schools (among other things) who were teaching the language to children in preparation of either "the general future" or for them learning another language later. The craze about this was honestly slowly growing to be very big, even train personnel and the police in a few different countries were being instructed in Esperanto for training for dealing with foreigners. Though of course, the world wars and then the monolingual English speakers growing to power really squashed a lot of it. And of course, most people used it as a hobby instead of thinking about it as a serious world language, but they did at least consider it fun so that's how it was propelled. I also remember reading that news about Esperanto was randomly broadcast on the radio in its early days; that's how I heard it reached the Faroe Islands for example. Also, a lot of the people who initially learnt the langauge were very educated to begin with (ex. rich French people, rich Swedish University students), so they had some influence on other people already. Those days were also different from today in that people needed a world language, but there really was none - English certainly wasn't big (German and French were much bigger!), but it was an age of new technology, new ideas about psychology, and easier/cheaper travel between countries and so on. But honestly I think the main point was that people were bored and thought learning a new language was simply fun when they heard about it, and it was an easy way to make foreign friends and get foreign news (this is a point I've read about quite a few times when I read texts from the same era - the local news was usually not at all accurate regarding foreign countries, and people loved collecting stuff like stamps and postcards). Edit: Something I forgot! I've read that people used to take a text (ex. a book) in Esperanto, and then translate it in their head, reading aloud, in real-time in front of their friends in order to convince them of how easy it was to understand and how fast it was to learn. This is mentioned in that one book that's a collection of Zamenhof's answers about grammar and vocabulary questions. Teachers were mainly pressing the fact that it was a good test of how good students were at language ("if they fail at Esperanto, we know they're no good at language and it's useless to teach them ex. French in secondary school"), and that it really gave the kids enthusiasm about history and geography, since the teachers were having the main part of learning Esperanto center around having the students send letters to lots of different countries in it. This is mentioned in quite a few places and pretty much corresponds with what modern educational tests with Esperanto are saying today, but I remember one source for this is here: $URL$ 

This graph tells you the exact same thing as the output in the Watson format. It just looks a bit differently - this is really no more a matter of style. Your question is thus not actually one about English slot grammar in particular: It is about the graphical representation of dependency trees - where the Watson parser referred to in the paper happened to use some less common format for displaying the output, which is, however, independent of the type of dependency grammar (e.g., slot grammar) or language (e.g, English). A universal Stanford dependency parse could be displayed in the way your Watson SG screenshot does, and a slot grammar analysis tree could be displayed in the way you are used to from the literature (like in the graph I provided above); the difference lies only in whether to show the graph horizontally or vertically, or whether to choose dots or arrow tips for the edges and apparently a vertical tree with dots happens to be more useful for the three column display so they chose that format to display the same thing. As a side note, you should be a bit careful about wording: head ≠ mother. The paragraph talks about heads and modifiers, which is a notion that involves some semantic/linguistic information, while "mother" is a purely syntactic (graph-theoretic) concept that is about which node is immediately dominant to some other node. is not the mother of - it is the head of the phrase that is the mother of the node consisting of . The mother node would be the complex node consisting of the entire sentnce; or in the NP , the mother node of both and would be the complex node consisting of exactly these two nodes. But since dependency trees, as opposed to constituent trees, are not direclty interested in constituent hierarchies and relations such as immediate dominance or sisterhood, that the complex consituent is the mother node is not directly of interest here - what is more important is that is the head of the phrase that belongs to. 

Grammar (how are words constructed and orderly connected? what classifications / parts of speech does English / Esperanto have?): It is extremely like Japanese, where there is a root word (that has no stem-change) which simply changes in ending or prefix according to which role in grammar it is playing, and where verbs can (and often do) compound onto each other. Also it's the same in where there are very very few exceptions. This basic concept is modernly very different in English, as for example, we have many mismatching pairs like "city, urban", "rain, pluvial", "fear, coward/poltroon, scary" and so on. In Esperanto every single pair stems from the same root, and there are a few more suffixes than in English, ex. one for "to cause" and one for "to become" (this was present in Old English and we have remnants of it today, ex. in bedazzled). For example: 

Footnotes 1 This may sometimes correspond to the opposite, but especially for words like pretty or hot which are scalar adjectives you won't necessarily receive the exact opposite like ugly or cold, but rather not pretty, but not exactly ugly or not hot, but not actually cold either - see my comment under the question. 2 The phenomenon for example doesn't apply for adjectives like dead, you can not be "deader" or so, although something could certainly be taller, heavier, older, ... Also you couldn't really make judgements about adjectives like alleged in John is an alleged murderer, being alleged is not a property that applies or doesn't apply to an individual. There are some more examples; just saying that the concept of something like positive values for adjectives has its restrictions. 3 By "meaningful alternatives", I mean alternatives that form a kind of natural class - you can certainly assume that the set of small [-tall] things forming something like a natural class, but it is implausibel to assume that there are any common features among the things that are not glued apart from not being glued, so adjectives like glued could i.m.o. be regareded as a more privative feature whose absence does not result in the formation of a natural class of meaningful alternatives. Just like in phonology, where it is perfectly fine to have a class of voiced [+voice] and a class of unvoiced [-voice] sounds, while on the other hand, you could form a class of all sounds that carry the feature [PHARYNGEAL], but it makes no sense to speak of the class of all sounds that are not pharyngeal because they don't have anything in common appart from being not pharyngeal. I think the distinction of privative features as opposed to, e.g., binary features roughly captures what I mean by an adjective not having "meaningful alternatives". But certainly, not every adjective can be regareded as a binary feature either, in fact I think that a strict partition throughout the whole domain between two meaningful alternatives [+property]/[-property] without any values additionally or in between is a very uncommon, if not impossible meaning for adjectives to carry. 

And so on and so forth. Changing the prefix or suffix is the way to get the corresponding related pair (unless you want to use a synonym, but this is the normal way). Kolere is angrily, kolero is anger. Ĉiela is celestial, ĉielo is sky. That sort of logic is the basis of the entire language. Patro is father, bopatro is father-in-law. Words are basically constructed in the same way as English - the starting word of a compound modifies the ending word of the compound (an oft-cited example is "songbird and birdsong"). Most of the prefixes and suffixes have some sort of equivalent in English too. The difference is that in Esperanto, practically any word can be compounded — this includes prepositions being compounded to each other, or prepositions being prefixed to verbs etc. (as is done in Swedish, among other languages). For example, "to pick out" can be said in exactly that word order, but "to outpick" can also be said. Prefixes and suffixes can also be compounded to each other, for an easy example pra-avo (grand-pa), pra-pra-avo (great-grand-pa). Numbers can also be compounded into words, ex. unu-op-ulo ("one-collective-being/person", meaning "individual"). As for word order in general, it has very little rules. The definite article and the word "no" have to come before the word they describe (but the adjective that describes the noun, can come either before or after the noun, for example). Words marking questions (like "does" in "Doesn't he want to eat?") have to be the very first word in the sentence or clause that introduces the question. The rest of the so-called word-order rules are basically just trends, people have decided that one trend or another gives a certain flavour and so on. The same is true for compounds, in that it's just usually a trend as to whether a word is written as a compound or written separately, both are allowed in the language. So in Esperanto it's perfectly acceptable to have sentences just as in English, with "I eat apples on Monday", but also perfectly acceptable is as in Swedish, "On Monday eat I apples", or even bigger variations like "I apples on monday eat". This is thanks to an accusative case existing, but even then, the rule is that "the accusative doesn't have to be used if the meaning is obvious". As for verb tenses and moods, everything that can be said in English is perfectly able to be said in Esperanto. The difference is that Esperanto speakers tend to not use all of the more precise forms. For example, Esperanto can easily say "I had been going", but instead people will simply say "I went". This mirrors Japanese, Swedish, etc. In a similar vein, Esperanto verbs do not conjugate according to number or gender, so it essentially looks like "I am, he am, they am". The parts of speech are just the same as in English if you ignore that it has the accusative case, and there are a few items that are simply more clarified than English. There are nouns, adjectives, adverbs, exclamations, prepositions, conjunctions and "particles" (I forget what they're called - words that aren't really any of these categories). There's present, future, and past tense, also the subjunctive and command form; other forms like "I want to go" are expressed with compounds or prepositions etc. The more clarified parts are that Esperanto has a distinct word for reflexive pronouns, like "I did it to myself", versus "I don't like it, myself". The only cases are nominative and accusative, but there is effectively a genitive because the same ending for adjectives is also the possessive ending (though we can also denote a posession using "of", as in English "the hair of the dog"). There is no indefinite artcle in Esperanto (which mirrors Icelandic, Japanese, etc) but if necessary we can say "one dog", for example. Vocabulary (from what languages does English / Esperanto borrow terms / derived words?): Originally, most words were from Latin and German. This branches into similarities with languages such as French, Yiddish, English, and Danish. Modernly, Esperanto borrows either the most international word, or the only word that can be borrowed (ex. "geisha" is of course only available from Japanese). In some cases, authors took words from languages they knew and so even if there were more international words, those words became the common ones (some vulgar words are like that). So, just as with where most of English's loanwords come from, most of Esperanto's new/loanwords nowadays come from Latin or Greek. Most technology words are therefore basically the same in both languages, such as "television" or "internet", where there's just one or two letters in difference between the languages. The Esperanto is "televidilo" (a compound of "tele- + see + tool"), as the Latin roots themselves are tele- and videre (to see); for internet it's "interreto". Medical and botanical/animal words however are pretty much always borrowed from Latin. There are a few trends like that how most time words (day, month, year, minute - tago, monato, jaro) were all originally borrowed from German. When Esperanto doesn't borrow words, it simply makes them up from existing roots. For example, bildliteraturo means comics, and bild is picture in German, Swedish, etc. Of course, literature comes from French and Latin (in Latin it's literatura, apparently). The same word in Swedish would be "drawn series", and in Japanese for example the compound includes "picture/painting" instead of "literature", so as you can see Esperanto creates the word from its most logical form instead of directly borrowing the way another language created it. Semantics (words in what languages share similar connotations and implications with English / Esperanto words?) There are a great many of these in base/root words, thanks to English's large vocabulary and the fact that, of course, no language uses words completely literally and everything can be a metaphor or implication anytime one wishes. For example: pluvial - pluvia hound (dog) - hundo paper - papero to comprehend - kompreni The main difference is that, once a word becomes a compound word, it usually ceases to look the same as English. Also there are cultural implications of certain words that are different from country to country, so they aren't always the same in Esperanto. This is especially true because Esperanto is least known about in the English-speaking world, and English's effect on Esperanto is actually very minimal compared to most other languages (ex. only 20% of translations into Esperanto come from English; other languages tend to be more like 60-80%). But here are synonyms with shades of meaning in Esperanto that correspond to synonyms with shades of meaning in English, yes. You didn't ask about it, but I figure you're probably wondering - Esperanto has made "neologisms", slang, and sometimes has its own special implications on words. For example, a "green pope" is someone who talks about Esperanto constantly (green is the "colour of Esperanto"). A "necessary-place" is a toilet/bathroom. There are also verbs and so on named after people, this is equivalent to saying "he's a Marxist", or "a McCarthy-ism", where the name of a certain famous person has taken on a particular meaning; only of course Esperanto has its own famous Esperanto speakers it takes the names from. Outright slang words are relatively few as it would complicate the language too much, but there are also unique meanings strongly implied with certain words that are only known to people who know Esperanto and/or its history (which, frankly, is most Esperanto speakers). As mentioned by the other person who replied, if you really want to know it you have to learn it (you don't have to become fluent even). It's honestly very fast to learn, all you need to do is get a dictionary like this one which has a list of prefixes and suffixes, then look up words on the online dictionary on lernu.net (which often breaks them into their compounds too). 

I don't really get your question. "Why are some word classes not immediately dominated by a phrasal category" - any word is dominated by some phrasal category. Your question is probably rather about why some words are dominated by a phrase that doesn't have the same category as this word (e.g. D is not dominated by DP). A node is always immediately dominated by the category that the head of this phrase determines. So the nodes in an NP will be dominated by NP because the head of the NP is an N, the nodes in a VP will be dominated by VP because the head of the VP is a V, ... It seems like in this syntax theory, NPs can also contain (optional) determiners, but whatever else there may be, whether there is also a D, a PP, ..., the head of the phrase is still N, and this is what determines the category of the NP. I haven't read that book myself; either there is also the notion of DPs that is not shown here or (more probably) all DPs are considered NPs - this is an eternal dispute among syntax theories, some argue that it is more reasonable to assume D is the head of a phrase like "the cat" because, amongst others, the choice of the determiner influences the inflection of the N so one can assume that NP is more like a complement to D that gets selected by it and so on, some prefer to go with the more traditional assumption that the head of such a phrase is still an N and that determiners are additional (if you stick to the assumption that all NPs must eventually go into DPs, you must assume an empty determiner head in a phrase like "I like [ø cats]") so the phrasal category is an NP. You say "for example, per (d) ...". What else do you mean? I don't see anything more that looks weird.
