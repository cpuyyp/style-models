If we start with an indestructibly supercompact cardinal $\kappa$, then we can do Easton forcing to get any reasonable continuum function on the regular cardinals $\geq \kappa$ and retain the supercompactness of $\kappa$. Then we can force PFA via the original Baumgartner way with a $\kappa$-c.c. forcing of size $\kappa$. Using these facts, it is then easy to show that no cardinals above $\kappa$ are collapsed, and the same cardinal arithmetic will hold after forcing PFA. 

Suppose $\langle s_\alpha : \alpha \in \omega_2 \cap \mathrm{cof}(\omega_1) \rangle$ is a sequence such that each $s_\alpha$ is an increasing cofinal map from $\omega_1$ to $\alpha$. Is it possible that for all $\alpha < \beta$, $\mathrm{ran}(s_\alpha) \cap \mathrm{ran}(s_\beta)$ is finite? Note that a pressing-down plus pigeonhole argument shows that CH must fail. 

In the Handbook of Set Theory, Foreman notes that in models constructed by Magidor from a huge cardinal, there exists a normal ideal on $[\omega_2]^{<\omega_1}$ that is $\omega_3$-saturated. Other results in this article imply that this is the minimal possible saturation, and such an ideal carries strong properties: Any generic ultrapower is well-founded and contains the same reals as the forcing extension. Is there anything known about lower bounds on the consistency strength of normal, $\omega_{n+1}$-saturated ideals on $[\omega_n]^{<\omega_1}$ for $n>1$? For $n = 1$, this is known to be equiconsistent with a Woodin cardinal, by results of Shelah and recent work of Jensen and Steel. (Thanks, Andres!) 

It is well known that ZFC + "There is a measurable cardinal" is equiconsistent with ZFC + "There is a precipitous ideal on $\omega_1$." Is ZFC + "There is a measurable $\kappa$ such that $2^\kappa > \kappa^+$" equiconsistent with ZFC + "There is a precipitous ideal on $\omega_1$" + CH + $2^{\omega_1}>\omega_2$? 

Is it consistent that there is no $\omega_2$-saturated ideal on $\omega_1$, but one is introduced by an $\omega_2$-closed forcing? Some motivation: If $\delta$ is a Woodin cardinal, then it remains so after any $\delta$-closed forcing. It is a theorem of Woodin and Shelah that if $\delta$ is Woodin and $G \subseteq Col(\omega_1,<\delta)$ is generic, then in $V[G]$ there is a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$. Jech and Prikry showed that if CH holds and there is a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$, then $2^{\omega_1} = \omega_2$. Thus if $\delta$ is inaccessible and $G \times H \subseteq Col(\omega_1,<\delta) \times Add(\omega_1,\delta^+)$ is generic, then $V[G][H]$ has no saturated ideals on $\omega_1$. But if $K \subseteq Col(\delta,\delta^+)$ is generic, then $V[K] \models Col(\omega_1,<\delta) \times Add(\omega_1,(\delta^+)^V) \cong Col(\omega_1,<\delta)$. Thus if $G,H,K$ are mutually generic, then $V[G][H][K]$ has a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$. By the $\delta$-c.c., $Col(\delta,\delta^+)^V$ remains $\delta$-distributive in $V[G][H]$. So we can force over $V[G][H]$ to add a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$ without adding subsets of $\omega_1$. But the question was whether we can do this with a $\delta$-closed forcing. 

Let $C$ be the Cohen algebra, the boolean completion of the partial order of finite partial functions from $\omega$ to 2, ordered by reverse inclusion. Does there exist an ideal $I$ on $C$ such that $C/I \cong \mathcal P(\omega)/ \mathrm{fin}$? 

Woodin gave a consistency proof of a normal $\omega_1$-dense ideal on $\omega_1$ from an almost-huge cardinal. He never published this argument, but it is written up by Foreman in the Handbook of Set Theory. In this article, and in a paper from the 90s, Foreman claims that this argument is adaptable to other cardinals to yield the consistency of an $\kappa$-dense ideal on $\kappa$ where $\kappa$ is the successor of a regular cardinal. I have had great trouble trying to prove this claim, as one crucial part of the argument seems specific to $\omega_1$ (which I will explain if you ask). So does anyone know how to prove Foreman's claim? 

Suppose $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal and $P$ is a $\kappa$-c.c. partial order. I want to know when are small sets added by subforcings of size $<\kappa$. The following seems well-known: 

I think the easiest way to see the fact is to use the extension property. Every such $P$ can be coded as a set of ordinals $A \subseteq \kappa$, and there is some transitive $X$ of rank > $\kappa$ and a set $B$ such that $(V_\kappa,\in,A) \prec (X,\in,B)$. Any $P$-name for a small set is seen by the larger structure as captured by $P$, so this reflects. Question 1: Are there counterexamples for some large cardinals which are weaker than weakly compact? If $\kappa$ is supercompact, then the same conclusion holds for all $\kappa$-c.c. $P$. This is easy to see by taking a supercompactness embedding $j$ with closure at least $|P|$ and noting that $j[P]$ is a regular suborder of $j(P)$. Supercompactness must be a total overkill hypothesis. Question 2: For what cardinals $\kappa$ do we have that every $\kappa$-c.c. partial order captures small sets in small factors? 

To answer, "What is $\mathcal F_{\mathrm{Col}(\omega,\omega_1)}$?": It is just the club filter on $\omega_2$. Since this forcing has size $<\omega_2$, every new club contains a ground model club, so the new club filter is generated by the old. For the next question, we use the following well-known result due to Harvey Friedman (generalized by Stavi and Abraham-Shelah): 

Question 1: Can we drop the assumptions of GCH or countably many cardinals between the top and bottom cardinal? Question 2: The argument I know using GCH also uses the regularity of the $\kappa_i$'s. But it is superfluous in the case of countably many cardinals between. So can we drop the regularity assumption in the GCH case? Question 3: The stronger Chang conjecture can be shown indestructible under $\lambda_0^+$-c.c. forcing. Does $\lambda_0^+$-c.c. forcing preserve the ordinary Chang conjecture? What about forcing of size $\lambda_0$? 

Suppose $\mathbb P$ is a countably closed forcing, and $\mathbb Q$ is a c.c.c. forcing that adds reals. Is $\mathbb P$ still proper in $V^{\mathbb Q}$? 

Can you name a ccc forcing with the following properties? 1) Atomless and separative 2) The least size of a dense set is large, say at least $\aleph_3$, hopefully as big as you like. 3) Existence is consistent with CH. 4) Preserves CH. If you can think of any, please list as many as you can. 

Suppose $\kappa$ is an almost huge cardinal. Using the characterization of Theorem 24.11 in Kanamori's book, one can show that if $j : V \to M$ is an embedding derived from an almost-huge tower of measures, then $M^{<j(\kappa)} \subseteq M$, but $M^{j(\kappa)} \nsubseteq M$. Also, there is some embedding with target $j(\kappa) = \lambda$ and a stationary $X \subseteq \{ \alpha < \kappa : \alpha$ is inaccessible$\}$ such that $j(X)$ is not stationary in $\lambda$ (in $V$). For example, we can take $\lambda$ to be non-Mahlo. Question: If $j : V \to M$ is an almost huge embedding derived from a tower with critical point $\kappa$, is there always a stationary $X \subseteq \{ \alpha < \kappa : \alpha$ is inaccessible$\}$ such that $j(X)$ is not stationary in $j(\kappa)$? 

I'm not sure if this is research level, so feel free to vote to migrate. Suppose we have a complete boolean algebra $A$, with a dense, $\sigma$-complete subalgebra $B$, and a $\sigma$-complete homomorphism $h : B \to C$, where $C$ is complete. Does $h$ have a $\sigma$-complete extension $h' : A \to C$? EDIT: I forgot to say that I'm interested in the case that $A$ is atomless. 

Given a countable model $M$ of set theory and an atomless, separative partial order $\mathbb{P} \in M$, can we construct (in the real universe) $2^\omega$ many pairwise mutually $\mathbb{P}$-generic filters $\{ G_r : r \in \mathbb{R} \}$? If CH holds, then the answer is yes. Recursively on the countable ordinals, we construct models $M_\alpha = M[G_\alpha]$, where $G_\alpha \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ meets all dense sets in $\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha} M_\beta$. We can also construct $2^\omega$ many distinct generic extensions. We can build (externally) a tree $T \subseteq \mathbb{P}$, where $T = \{ p_s : s \in 2^{<\omega} \}$. Make $T$ such that: (a) If $|s| = n$, then $p_s \in D_n$, where $\{ D_n : n \in \omega \}$ lists the dense subsets of $M$. (b) For $s$ a prefix of $t$, $p_s \geq p_t$. (c) For all $s$, $p_{s0} \perp p_{s1}$. Every real $r$ determines a distinct branch through $T$ and an associated $\mathbb{P}$-generic filter $G_r$. So we have $2^\omega$ many distinct filters, and since the models are countable, a pigeonhole argument shows that we must have $2^\omega$ distinct models. But this argument does not show that the filters are mutually generic. 

In the first-order context, "reflection" of a formula $\varphi(x)$ below $\kappa$ refers to the the following situation: 

Question 1: How do you show this? Question 2: Is there an example where adding a Cohen subset of $\omega_1$ changes the truth-value of, "There is a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$"? Perhaps under MM? 

Probably the interesting examples involve large cardinals. Instead of just collapsing $\mathbb R$ to be countable, force with $Col(\omega,<\kappa)$, where $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal. This is the direct limit of repeatedly making the reals countable. So for each ordinal $\alpha \leq \kappa$, there is a new version of the reals $\mathbb R_\alpha$, and for $\alpha < \kappa$ these all become countable in the end. This feature is essential to the landmark theorem of Solovay that in the final model, every definable set of reals--definable meaning is in $L(\mathbb R)$--is Lebesgue measurable, equal to an open set modulo a meager set, and if uncountable contains a perfect subset. The proof is presented in Chapter 26 of Set Theory by Thomas Jech. It is a bit involved, but a key step that relates to your question is the following. Suppose $\mathbb R$ is the version of the reals in the final model, and $r \in \mathbb R$. Then in the final model, the intersection of all measure one Borel sets coded in $L(r)$ is measure one in $L(\mathbb R)$. This is because in the final model there are only countably many of these. Now with larger cardinals this enables us to actually say things about "our own universe." If there is a Woodin cardinal $\delta$, then there is a forcing called the stationary tower that turns $\delta$ into $\aleph_1$ and has some special features. Say we start in the model $V$ and $G$ is the generic filter for the stationary tower. Then: (1) There is a submodel $M$ of $V[G]$ that is closed under countable subsequences (thus contains all the new reals), and an elementary embedding $j : V \to M$. (2) There is another forcing extension $V[H]$ with the same reals as $V[G]$, where $H$ is generic for $Col(\omega,<\delta)$. Thus Solovay's theorem may be applied to say that every set of reals in $L(\mathbb R)^{V[G]}$ has all the regularity properties. By the elementarity of $j$, this holds for $L(\mathbb R)^V$ as well. There are set theorists on MO who are far more expert than me on these topics, so probably even more fascinating results can be given. 

Suppose $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal. Consider the termspace forcing for adding a Cohen subset of $\kappa$ after $\mathbb P= Col(\omega,<\kappa)$. Members are Levy names for countable partial functions from $\kappa$ to 2, ordered by $\tau \leq \sigma$ iff $1 \Vdash \tau \leq \sigma$. Call this $T(\mathbb P, Add(\kappa))$. It is well known that the identity map is a projection from $\mathbb P \times T(\mathbb P, Add(\kappa))$ to the iteration $\mathbb P * \dot Add(\kappa)$. Furthermore in this situation it is not hard to show that $T(\mathbb P, Add(\kappa)) \cong Add(\kappa)$. So if $G \times H$ is $\mathbb P \times Add(\kappa)$-generic, then in the extension there is $I$ such that $G * \dot I$ is $\mathbb P * \dot Add(\kappa)$-generic. My question is what about the opposite. In $V[G* \dot I]$ is there an $Add(\kappa)^V$-generic? 

In section 2.3 of Paul Larson's book, The Stationary Tower, he shows that if $V$ has a proper class of completely Jonsson cardinals, then forcing with the class-sized stationary tower $\mathbb{P}_\infty$ yields an elementary embedding $j : V \to V[G]$. Here, $V[G]$ is a direct limit of generic ultrapowers. He notes that $V$ and $G$ are not definable classes in $V[G]$, so this embedding only exists "from the outside." 

Start with a model of GCH. Let $\kappa$ be singular. Add $\kappa^{++}$ Cohen subsets of $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)^+$-- the forcing is $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)^+$-closed and $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)^{++}$-c.c. Then we'll have $\kappa^\kappa = \kappa^{++}$ but $\kappa^{\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)} = \kappa^+$ since we've added no $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$-sequences of ordinals. 

We can justify this with a general fact about forcing. Fact: Let $G$ be $\mathbb P$-generic, where $\mathbb P$ is separative. If $X$ is a subset of $\mathbb P$ in the ground model, $X \subseteq G$, and $m = \inf X$, then $m \in G$. Proof: Consider the set $\{ p \in \mathbb P : p \leq m$ or $(\exists x \in X)p \perp x \}$. Using separativity we show this is a dense set. Since $X \subseteq G$, this implies $m \in G$. Now I claim that in this situation $r = \inf_{\beta<\lambda} r \restriction \beta$. Certainly $r \leq r \restriction \beta$ for all $\beta$. If $q$ also has this property, then $q \leq r$ by the definition of the ordering at limit stages of iterations. ($q \leq r$ just means $q \restriction \beta \leq r \restriction \beta$ for all $\beta < \lambda$.) 

The following statement can be proven using elementary submodels and sufficiently generic conditions: "If $S \subseteq cof(<\kappa) \cap \kappa^+$ is stationary, and $\kappa^{<\kappa} =\kappa$, then the stationarity of $S$ is preserved by $\kappa$-closed forcing." If we just assume $\kappa$ is regular, do we need the cardinal arithmetic? 

Let $\alpha > 0$ be any ordinal. Consider the forcing $Add(\omega,\alpha) * Add(\omega_1,1)$. Let $B$ be its boolean completion. Let $\dot{X}$ be the canonical $B$-name for the generic subset of $\omega_1$ added by the second iterand. By forcing folklore, there is a complete subalgebra $A \subseteq B$ that adds $X$, completely generated by the boolean values $|| \check{\beta} \in \dot{X} ||$ (see Jech p. 247). One can check that for each $\beta < \omega_1$, $|| \check{\beta} \in \dot{X} || = (1,\check{ \lbrace (\beta,1) \rbrace } ) $. Questions: (1) What is the nature of $A$ in relation to $B$? Although $A$ adds all the reals of $B$, I think I can show that it is always a proper subset of $B$ (even for $\alpha = 1$). This leads to the second question. (2) If $G$ is generic for $A$, what is the nature of the quotient algebra $B/G$? One can show that it is $(\omega,\infty)$-distributive. In the case where $\alpha$ is countable, it is atomic. Is it nonatomic for uncountable $\alpha$? Is it strategically closed? (3) If $G$ is generic for $A$, does $V[G]$ always contain some $Add(\omega,\alpha)$ generic, like in the case $\alpha$ is countable? Edit: I thank J.D. Hamkins for his answer, but I already knew about the case $\alpha < \omega_1$, as stated in the original post. I would really like some insight on the case $\alpha \geq \omega_1$. 

Real-valued measurable cardinals (RVM) are equiconsistent with 2-valued measurable cardinals. I believe this is due to Solovay and Kunen. (Solovay for the forcing direction, Kunen for the inner model $L[U]$.) They contradict CH, so their existence is not implied by standard large cardinals. I claim that Freiling's argument applies equally against RVMs. The key part of his argument is the "symmetry" part, which seems to be the fishiest part. Suppose there is a $\kappa$-additive real-valued measure on $\kappa$. If we buy Freiling's reasoning, then it seems also for any function $f : \kappa \to [\kappa]^{<\kappa}$, it should be equally probable whether $y \in f(x)$ or $x \in f(y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the positions where two darts land. Since $\kappa$ is RVM, the objection that arbitrary events don't have a measure goes away. (Right?) But if $f(\alpha) = \alpha$ for $\alpha < \kappa$, then we get the same paradox: After we know $x$, the probability that $x \in f(y)$ is 1, and the probability that $y \in f(x)$ is 0. Well nonmeasurability hasn't really gone away. The underlying event space is really $\mathbb R^2$. If $\frak c$ is RVM, then the product measure generated by the total measure on $\mathbb R$ is NOT a total measure on $\mathbb R^2$. The set $\{ (\alpha, \beta ) \in \kappa^2 : \alpha < \beta \}$ is nonmeasurable.
