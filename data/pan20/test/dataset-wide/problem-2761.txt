However the result of the Michaelson-Morley experiment which should have shown the aether to be motionless - but didn't; and nor was it saved by adopting the notion of aether dragging, where the motion of matter drags the aether along saved it as shown by the Fizeau experiment. This forced Lorentz to develop a theory of length contraction, which he claimed was a real physical effect, and local time, which he thought a heuristic; however Poincare thought otherwise, and was the trigger for his investigation into the idea of simultaneity; he writes in A measure of time: 

I could argue that looking at this chair here in my room that many different languages have a different word for this very specific and concrete object. I could also argue in line with semiotics that the word 'chair' is an arbitrary convention not tied in any way or form physically with this chair in front of me. I could further argue that the word chair is made more ambiguous by the way its written in so many different languages, through the many scripts, and through all the differing modes in which writing is written when hand-written; and though all the many ways it is spoken and pronounced. Its also very true that the word 'chair' does not exist in this world, despite the fact one sees the word 'chair' being used everywhere. Perhaps there is a platonic essence of a chair in some other world that is reflected in us by the imagination or the intellect. Yet all of this doesn't deny the very specific sense in which the word is useful, being so ready-at-hand, we use it without thinking. In our minds it is so that chair that it takes some mental effort to disassociate the word 'chair' from the object 'chair'. So, in analogy, rather than deductive logic - or would analogical logic be a fairer term - rather than interpret the many different forms of the spiritual that has informed the spirit of man through centuries and millenia, as being somehow contradictory; perhaps one ought to see it as a constant with many manifestations. 

I can't speak for philosophical logic, but for mathematical logic, Tarskis assertion became a definition; in the sense that these are good requirements to have for a mathematically tractable definition of truth; that this is a good definition (mathematically) is shown by the consequences of his definitions and theory; and this entailed the development of Model Theory. Here, Godel showed in his completeness theorem that: 

One possibility is to examine the arguments of a political theorist interested in the notions of crime, justice and the individual man (or woman); and that in relation to a historical event. Take for example the book Eichmann in Jerusalem: A report into the banality of evil by the political theorist Hannah Arendt; and notice that the sub-title is asking the same question that you are being asked and so should prove helpful in understanding the dimensions of this question; it's worth quoting from this entry: 

Deleuze has a concept of difference which he establishes in opposition to a contradiction: one thought negating an other - as used in Hegelian dialectics. One could build an ethic of toleration on difference. 

According to Wittgensteins Tractatus, the facts of the physical worlds, and natural laws occupy only a small place in the space of all logical possibilities; and these possibilities are the horizons of our vision. However, according to Kant logic is not in the world (noumena) but in phenomena; Wittgenstein doesn't say where as he doesn't specify the location of logic. He also says there may be unlogical worlds, but we haven't the capacity to imagine them. 

I'd suggest that post-cold war Communism and Marxism no longer poses a threat, the Big Other is now Political Islam and/or terrorism. Zizeks pop-culture references sugar-coat the difficult philosophy and politics and makes the 'medicine go down'. He's succeeded in making it fashionable & chic. 

How can one work outside of the 'meaningful and sensible'? It is our horizon of thought as remarked by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus. 

Your snapshot of consciousness is Augustines 'confining consciousness to the momentary present'. But then the question is how do we then perceive change, that is succession. Further down in this entry of the SEP, you have cinematic realism which does roughly what you might think it does. Cinema after all consists of static frame after static frame but when we watch it we are only aware of movement & not stasis. But the authors say that this position suffers from defects, and not seriously considered. What they propose is that momentary states of experiencing is not all we experience in the moment, we also 'experience' its immediate past. They call this representation - as it is not immediate experience, its in the past after all, and they also call it retention as its part of our memory - we retain the experience of the past. It is obviously Kantian - in the sense of talking about the unity of consciousness from the unity of experience (from the unity of phenomenal reality). That is the unity of visual consciousness from the unity of visual experience of the unitary phenomenal world. 

Marx through turning Hegel 'upside-down' has huge historical importance on literature, art, economics & most obviously politics. A great deal of the history of the 20th century would not be understandable without it. Freuds discovery of the unconscious & dream hinterland helped propel surrealism as a significant art movement, psycho-therapy, David Lynchs film career, advertising & the use of effective propaganda by the state & big business. Fanons philosophy of the Native was crucial in the theoretical discourse of the anti-colonial movement (as amplified by Sartre). He was taught by Aime Cesaire a left-leaning poet from Martinique who studied in France and a founder of the 'negritude' movement which included Leopold Senghor, president of Senegal. Derrida (who was born in Algeria) through subversion of the semiotics as channelled by Gayatri Spivak is important to a lot of activism around voicing the subordinate position of the subaltern - "can the subaltern speak" - this term itself is taken from Gramsci, an italian marxist thinker & activist. Levi-Strauss through his structural anthropology and field-research in the Amazon made intellectuel space for mass indigenous movements possible - for example in south america, and india. Lyotard turned modernism on its head - after Nietszches derailment of the grand narrative of Christianity - helping to derail the grand narrative of modernism - of truth & progress. He moved the 'society of the Spectacle' - the preliminary investigation into the new media by the situationist Guy Debord where simulcra takes the place of reality in recognition of the heightened importance of media. The Kantian notion of the observer being implicated in the observed had ramifications in the philosophy of quantum physics aka the copenhagen interpretation. His revitalisation of the idea of Aristotelean categories was significant enough that the founders of Category Theory (in mathematics) named their discipline after it. (Although not traditionally counted as a continental philosopher, as he is not a modern one) Liebniz ideas on the relativity of space by way of Mach influenced Einstein. 

The question is a little confusing. You cannot have a state without time - a state evolves in time. When a measurement occurs this provokes a collapse in the state through decoherence with the environment it then continues to evolve. Note a measurement is defined to be anything that actually causes a collapse, it doesn't ahve to be a specific measuring device operated by some conscious being. Hence, at least when physically modelled, there is no prior state. However one can speculate at what happens at the Big Bang. Since spacetime is held to have started then, a prior state again isn't possible - there is literally no spacetime in which it can occur. There may be other cosmologies which allows spacetime to continue through this 'singularity'. One could argue since the physical world is uncomfortable with infinite anything, this is only an apparent singularity and spacetime does continue through it. In which case the state should also continue through this singularity. But this isn't mainstream. So, the answer to your question is no. 

This is true even if everyone in the 'mass' individually is very smart; for smart people can disagree in many different and various ways; the specific problem here is that to get agreement only the most simplest propositions can be agreed on: for example, 'this cup is a cup' or 'this spade is a spade'; this is one sense in which sense the masses aren't smart; and from this quite a lot can follow ... for example, being susceptible to rumour. 

For it to take root, it must be drawn out and that takes work; traditionally, as demonstrated by Platos dialogues and by the Analects this was done by speech; today this is done by books; and by various forms of mass education; less effective because a book cannot interrogate, turn-over and discuss; it doesn't have the form of the dialectic; and mass means dispersal of attention; so ineffective; and substituting instead sociality and gregariousness. Confucious might be useful in thinking through your concerns; especially when one might re-interpret filiality on terms of community and friendship; and simply not kin. The translation by Robert Eno is done very well; with good and clear commentary. Simone Weil Simone Weil was a French philosopher from an assimilated Jewish background who had strong Christian leanings; as a philosopher she leant towards Plato, in the way Keats did 'truth is beauty'; in her book On the need for roots she writes on how modernity as a revolution removes the individual from the thickness of traditional society to a kind of mass anomie; that the future is made up of the past - so unlike the futurists she does not fetid he the future nor technology; she was a Marxist (when Marxism was fashionable amongst the French intellectual elite - her class-mates at the ecole normalien included Beauvoir and Sartre); but she turned away from it by transcended it towards a mystical Platonism. Her lectures on philosophy (actually notes taken by a student) lean towards truth not in the logical form so successfully leveraged by the positivists; but towards more towards disclosure in the Heideggerian sense; you might find them useful in terms of how philosophy is traditionally concieved in the Western tradition; she has a concept of atarxia (attention) which she theorised on in her book Gravity and Grace: 

But this appears to be mis-reading Grays argument. In Classical Economics we have the Invisible Hand of Adam Smiths which in todays terminology is the price-mechanism; but in Adams Smiths conception one also note that it is the hand of Providence. One thinks here Michaelangelos fresco where God breathes life into Adam symbolised by the (near) touching of hands. From Smiths, The Theory of Moral Sentiments 

This works, and is in fact at the root of Newton's second law of motion where he defines force. So as a philosophical concept this definition is fruitful. Yet, the paradoxical formulation above is the formulation which lingers in the mind. It stays. It takes root. It asks to be noticed and knocks against the mind asking to be made sense of when in fact it is so constructed as not to make sense. Can in fact some sense be made of it? 

I'm not sure that this is right; one should distinguish between actual moral practice, and philosophical or scholarly disputations; Determinism, as you point out, suggests the denial of free-will; but this argument - even if it proves true and is irrefutable - isn't a mitigating plea if you were in a court of law being suspected of some crime or misdemeanour. 

Kant is famous for subordinating reality in one aspect (the phenomenal) to consciousness via his Copernican Revolution of subordinating objects to the ground of intuition. Husserl, in his theory of Phenomenology, is famous for pointing out that a marker for consciousness is Intentionality; this in fact was reintroduced into philosophy by his mentor, Bretano: 

Roughly, the centre should organise or structure the whole, but looked at historically, different centres have been substituted,leaving the structure the same. But the structure, by the theory of structuralism, should determine the centre. It does not - hence it escapes structurality - (and hence Post-Structuralism). Thus 'the Einsteinian centre/constant is not a centre/constant'. Essentially Derrida is saying that Hippolytes example drawn from the physical sciences is not a good example of his ideas, this is only to be expected as he Derridas paper is on the human sciences and not the physical or mathematical ones in this specific form. This critique is echoed by Gabriel Stolzenberg , an American professor of mathematics, in an unpublished letter to the New York Times wrote: 

Jabberwocky language is an interesting comparison; here's the first two lines of Lewis Carrols delightful verse: 

One then deduces that reality must be non-reality. This ties in with the notion of maya; personally and probably mistakenly I tend to think that maya signifies that there is more to reality than meets the senses, which is provably true.
