Are you sure you downloaded the correct version? There might be a specific version meant for server and the version you are trying to install is XP. Also 32bit vs 64bit might make a difference. Maybe you need the full package? $URL$ Or scroll down to the bottom of the following website for some command line switches to try... $URL$ 

I'm not sure how well my answer applies, but at my company we use ESX and virtual center to manage. When I log into Virtual Center I look at our ESX server settings, not the settings of the individual servers. We have 5 ESX servers in a clustered environment, so I'm just looking at one of those 5. I click on the configuration tab, then "Virtual Machine Startup/Shutdown". I have seen this option before in other versions of VMWare, so I bet you have it too somewhere. Once in there you can edit the properties of this item and choose how servers startup/shutdown. We set all of our servers to "Any Order" except the absolute critical ones, those are ordered, but we only order a select few. Hope this helps... 

Sounds to me like the issue exists with the computer or your account. I'm hesitant to think its an issue with your account since you say ADUC works on other computers, presumably with your account. Does the computer you try this from have a connection to the network? I would assume so, but it might not be a bad idea to do a release and renew from the command prompt. Also verify the IP settings to make sure they are valid for your network. The computer you are trying this from, is it on the domain? If not add it then try ADUC. If it is, check the computer name and make sure an object exists for it in Active Directory. If the object exists, try removing the computer from the domain through System Properties and re-adding it to the domain after a reboot. If none of that helps I'm bout out of ideas... I will update if I think of anything else. 

You actually wouldn't need to license Ghost to them, just XP. But you do need to buy licenses for the number of computers you are ghosting. My recommendation would be to use Clonezilla. Load the image on a USB drive or thumb drive then when you have to image a computer just pop in the USB drive or thumb drive, pop in the CD, and restore. Very easy, no mounting of drives necessary, and should be very quick. 

So according to Cisco's website, yes you can have your 877 be a server. But I would highly recommend against it. I setup a VPN solution with the 871 routers connecting to a head end 2800 router and had all kinds of problems. Lower end devices just are not made to handle a lot of simultaneous VPN connections. My recommendation would be to buy a 2800 or 3800 series router with a VPN module. The hardware module will allow for more connections, but will also handle the connections a lot better. How you want to set it all up and where to put your head end is up to you, but I think having the head end sit on the outside of your network just as your 877 does today is probably the easiest. In the links below you will find a lot of ways to do this, but the easiest is to use a head-end like you have now, but with beefier hardware. Take out the spaces for those links and search the second one for "Easy VPN". $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Routing and firewall seems a little too high level for this issue. You say servers connected on the same switch will ping, but ones connected to other switches do not. I would say you need to trunk your VLANs on the switches. Check all your trunks and make sure that the necessary VLANs are added. If you run VTP, make sure you added the new lab VLAN to VTP using the VTP server. The reason I do not think its a routing issue is because if two devices exist in different networks they always have to talk to a gateway before they can talk to each other. Doesn't matter if they are connected to the same switch or not. So in the case of the server and lab computer, they are in different VLANs. So if one tries to ping the other, that ping has to go up to a layer 3 address first (the gateway) before the ping will respond. The OP states that a ping from the lab computer to the server on the same switch works fine, so routing should not be an issue. 

What I'm getting at, 90% of my servers have something like HP DL380 Gen7,8,9 or HP DL380 G7,8,9. That is standard names I'm used to. But a a few follow a name like HP DL380R07 or DL380R05 or something like that. The "R0" is throwing me off. And these product names dont have "Gen" or "G" in the name which is what I'm used to. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm hoping this is the right place to ask... 

I think the scope of the organization matters a lot. If there are 200 hosts total or less on a network and traffic doesn't need to be segmented for any reason, why add the complexity of VLANs and subnets? But the larger the scope, the more it might make sense. Splitting up networks that normally wouldn't need to be can make some things easier though. For instance, our PDUs that supply power to servers are in the same VLAN or subnet as the servers. This means our vulnerability scanning system used on our server range also scans PDUs. Not a huge deal, but we don't need PDUs to be scanned. Also it would be nice to DHCP the PDUs since they are a pain to configure, but since they are in the same VLAN as servers right now, that is not very feasible. While we don't need another VLAN for the PDUs, it can make some things easier. And this gets into the whole more vs less VLANs argument that will continue on for ever. Me, I just think have VLANs where it makes sense. If for instance we gave PDUs their own VLAN it doesn't mean we always have to give small groups of devices their own VLAN. But rather in this case it might make sense. If a group of devices doesn't need to have it's own VLAN and there are no advantages to doing so, then you might want to consider just leaving things as they are. 

Isn't the reason why xhtml appears broken in IE because IE won't adhere to certain html standards, or wont follow those standards? For instance, if you view the code in IE it appears broken, but in Firefox or Opera it doesn't. Back to the original post; is it possible you could just use a different Internet Browser and then it wouldn't matter if xhtml was used? 

If you are referring to computer systems that allow for open public Internet surfing, I would recommend following these links... $URL$ $URL$ The first will get you started downloading Boothbox. A Free Open Source Internet Kiosk. The second link is a post I wrote with a guide I wrote to help one work with Boothbox. My actual document is missing from my website, but I will try to correct it tonight. 

So the problem is we have a device or host that needs to communicate on a specific VLAN. This VLAN is not new, it is running all throughout our environment and works fine. But the VLAN was recently configured on the switch in question, a Cisco 3750. The DHCP server is handing out addresses on that VLAN with no problem. I have verified the cable between the host and switch and tried multiple hosts, but none of them can communicate or get an address. I plugged my laptop into an empty port which had a different VLAN assigned and immediately got a DHCP address. When I changed that port to the same VLAN I'm having issues with I got the same problem. The laptop just sits there and tries to DHCP an address but nothing happens. I double checked the cores and their Layer 3 VLAN config and its fine too. Plus I figured the issue couldn't be with them because the VLAN works fine everywhere else it exists. So the only other thing I can think of is the switch, but the VLAN exists on the switch and seems to be configured correctly. The trunks appear to be configured just fine as well too. Anyone have any ideas? I'm lost on this one. 

I'm thinking something to do with the network or Internet for this issue since you say CPU, Mem, and Page don't seem active... Check your Windows Update settings for your server and home user on XP. I notice on my system at home that if updates are set to automatically download that when they do download sometimes the system really lags until those downloads finish. If that doesn't seem to help, check for NIC activity. I'm not sure what a good method for doing this would be. You can run Performance Monitoring and when the system seems slow check NIC activity in that. If you see spikes during lag times, you could then do a capture with Wireshark to see what traffic is going out/in of that server. If both of those don't seem to help, I'm not sure what else you could check for. Faulty hardware somewhere along the line would be my next guess.
