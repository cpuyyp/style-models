I suffered the same when I first started with running. Inhaling and exhaling also takes energy, so you want to control it. I was told to train that by holding my breath for one more step than what my untrained breathing was asking me to. This is probably not something to do during a whole session, but to dedicate some minutes to it, as for other elements of running technique. At least, it worked for me. 

Are there any benefits on running soaked in water? I've been to a half-marathon length race recently. Temperature was high, above 25 ÂºC. There were runners who, in the provisioning sites (I'm not sure about the correct word, sorry, I mean the intermediate points where the organization offers you liquid or solid refreshments), took several bottles of water, emptying the first ones on themselves and drinking from the last one, looking like they just fell in the pool. I was wondering if doing that provides a real benefit (like improved refrigeration, less sweating and minor loss of hydration). I'm more likely to think it is abusive and can lead to running out of water for the other racers, but I'm interested in the physiologic and performance parts rather than in the ethics. Edit: probable benefits are the cooling "sensation" and some extra help with thermoregulation. But, does it provide a lasting thermoregulation or is it counterproductive soon? I'm thinking of water nebulization in fire fighting, which is more effective than drenching for dropping the room temperature. Edit: after the discussion and rethinking what words to use in searches I've found some contradictory related information: 

It is not only about over/underpronation. There are other subjects for running technique where actual experts can help you: if you don't step right under your vertical, if you have a leg shorter than the other (most probably everyone has, it may be significant enough or not), if you bend your feet to the interior, and so. Injuries aren't gentlemen, they tend to appear in the last weeks of your marathon training and stay for long. If you can afford profesional advice in a sports medicine clinic go for it. If doing it saves you just one injury in all your sport life and a pair of sessions of physiotherapy, it paid both in headaches and cash. And I would not rely in the advice you can get in a shop: even if they provide some sort of advice, they may be at most "technicians" with a crash course in the most obvious things. 

I've tried some sort of speed walking (~8km/h, 5mph) as a complement or substitute for training. Up to the point of making some muscles hurt. And there is definitely a relation between that muscles and running. Just walking should strengthen that muscle and improve your general running, but I doubt that it is a time-efficient training for either 5k or even marathon. Nonetheless, for mountain races, where steep hills that are almost impossible to run over are common and most people just walk them, a good walking pace may make you earn significant time. At least, it has worked for me in ultra-marathons. 

Keep full body strength workouts but reduce load to 2x per week, alternate with 2-3 running workouts with higher intensity than on first stage; Keep strength workouts at 3x per week, but change to lower/upper body split - train legs 1x per week and upper body 2x per week - should give legs a chance to recover better and compensate the load on upper body; Leave strength training unchanged but have less running workouts than on first stage - 1-2 per week but with higher intensity. 

I'm currently doing 3x week strength training using New Rules of Lifting: Supercharged workouts which promote full body training approach. My plan is to add running training to it in order to improve cardiovascular endurance, lack of which I feel both in daily activity and during strength workouts. Having a strength training as a first priority, question is how to combine both. Some of my thoughts follow, I would appreciate your help to sort things out. At the very first stage (first 2-3 weeks, probably), running workouts will probably look more like learning to run rather than any serious load that could affect other training, so I suppose that I could keep 3 strength workouts per week and combine them with 3 short (15-20 minute max) running workouts. Is it better to have 6 days of trainings, with just one type of activity at each day, or to have two workouts per day sometimes in order to get more days of rest? At some point, I suppose, running could start to affect the recovery between strength workouts and more options arise: 

Obviously, all these options are legit and I should probably try them all, but I'd like to receive some feedback on how this works if someone has tried it, or some other options that I could use, or, also appreciated, some advice on what I definitely should not do. 

When fat is burned, it just goes away. What could be hanging out is excessive skin that is left if you lose fat very fast and/or have skin elasticity issues, but it's not your case. The effect of "hanging out" on 2nd picture could be explained by different level of tension in you ABS, the position that you would feel as "relaxed" is nonetheless different depending on how did you exercise lately, what time of day it is, how much did you eat etc. As it was said in previous answer, belly is usually the last thing to go away. How much did your weight reduce? You should probably just give it some more time. 

I know that the key to success in weight training is consistency and regime: never skipping a workout and so on. I manage to be consistent sometimes, sometimes not (and these tend to be periods of 4-6 months). When the real life breaks the balance and consistency, I don't manage to be get to the gym for 1.5 hours 3 times a week, sometimes it's two times a week with 5 day interval, sometimes skipping a week and so on. While it's obvious that any really good results can't be produced during such periods, what could be the best approach to the training in such circumstances? Focusing on few base movements like squat and press and doing all of them each time? Or trying to do as much different exercises as possible for less sets? I'm not looking for a definite silver-bullet solution, but what are the options which make sense? Thank you all.
