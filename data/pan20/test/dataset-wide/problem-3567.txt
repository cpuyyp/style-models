Strength training and cardio provide a potent mixture to burn fat. The problem with strength training alone is that it burns fewer calories than you would during cardio. For example, an hour of intense strength training will burn between 270 calories and 450 calories while you exercise (depending on how heavy the weight is). Running at 6 mph for an hour will burn closer to 1000 calories (depending on how heavy you are). The other difference is that as your body builds more muscle, you are burning more calories all the time. If you do a strength training program like Rippetoe's Starting Strength or Medhi's StrongLifts 5x5 you are working out 3 days per week. Each workout is up to an hour long depending on how much rest you need between sets. You will lose fat, but maybe not as quickly as if you incorporate cardio. NOTE: you do get a cardio workout lifting weights. In my situation: I started the StrongLifts 5x5 program 6 weeks ago and worked up from just the bar to the following weights: 

The key with any new exercise is to start out light and progress from there. You may want to start out body weight only. I wish I knew something that may be more fun that gets your posterior chain involved. However, once you've increased the strength of the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, calves, back) you will find that the hip pain will start to correct itself. The same type of pain can happen if a lifter only focuses on pressing movements and never does curls. The muscle imbalance can cause a form of tendinitis in the elbows. 

Step 1: Make sure you are using compound movements in addition to isolation exercises. This puts you in the best position to make use of the protein you consume. Squats, pull ups, deadlifts, bench press and military press. All of these things help increase your body's demand from protein. Never neglect your legs. They aren't glamorous, but they help complete the look. Step 2: Spread your protein intake throughout the day. The majority of your protein you want from real food. Lean meats, fruits and veggies should be the foundation of any bodybuilder's menu. Save the protein shake for training: 

Don't get too caught up in supplements, as the effects are typically minor. You will get better results in managing recovery through other means: 

The most important thing with getting people started lifting is to help them to like lifting. The worst thing you can do is to overwhelm them with details. The dirty little secret for newbies is they can do just about anything and make some relatively quick increases (with few exceptions). That means it matter less what they do and more that they do something consistently. The real answer to your question depends on where they want to go with the training. Are they wanting to look better, get better at sports, or just be strong? The basics of the beginning program will probably be the same, but when they know how it is going to relate to their end goal they can be more motivated. The most effective approach is that you train them. Giving them a program and saying "here do this" is the least effective way to train. Step 1: Assess and Plan The first step is to find out where they are. The things you need to find out are: 

The truth is that your goals are going change over time as you set your eyes on new possibilities you didn't have before. The bottom line is that I don't see it as an either/or proposition, but more of a proportion question. Since your stated goal is getting shredded, the rest of the answer will be centered around that. Losing Body Fat While Maintaining Muscle Mass This is all about diet. It's usually the first step in "getting shredded" unless you are already underweight. The keys to getting shredded with your diet are: 

When you are gaining facts, look at both sides of the argument. This will help you gain a better understanding of why things work. One example is an article on how intermittent fasting stacks up against science. Also understand that there are different variations of intermittent fasting, each with their own advantages/disadvantages. The bottom line is that when you take proper steps toward improving your health, your body will respond in kind. The fact that the eating protocol is helping your acidity issues is great, but do understand it might be more related to better food choices rather than just the timing of your food. How to disarm negative arguments The first thing to do is ask, "why do you think this will hurt me?" There may be something more specific than just intermittent fasting at the core of their concerns. There might be something you can improve in your approach to intermittent fasting. When you hear the concern, and you actually do have an answer for it, share the basis of what you are doing and how it's affecting your health. If you don't have an answer for it, then simply answer "I haven't considered that, where can I get more information?" (do your own search on the information, both pro and con trying to find information from people who actually know about nutrition). You might be able to arrive at a way to address your health concerns and your family's concerns at the same time. For example, if your variant of intermittent fasting is like the Lean Gains protocol, you have an 8 hour eating window which is ample time for 3 meals a day--and you also have requirements for your macro-nutrients which will improve your overall health. This would probably work better for your situation than a 6 days eating, 1 day fast (or worse a 5/2 day split). Bottom line is find a middle ground that is based on facts that both you and your family can be happy with. 

In contrast to @rmx's answer, I'll say that the zones are a very useful way to intelligently build up your cardiovascular performance. The key is to get tested to find your personal heart rate zones. They will also provide you with a set of workouts that incorporate some intervals to increase your overall performance. The zone testing will find your AB (Aerobic Base) and AT (Anaerobic Threshold). The interval training will be designed around improving your performance by increasing your AB and/or the distance between your AB and AT levels. The idea is to improve the cardio to the point where your running heart rate will be within the aerobic region. By your description of your running and heart rate, you are in the same boat as me: 

If you find that you are running the bad side of average for a few training sessions in a row, it's probably time to back off the volume a little before you head into a really bad training session. If you are running on the good side of average, that's the perfect place to be. You're going to have to take the steps of planning, performing, and evaluating continually throughout your training. It's the only way to tell if you are making progress and how to correct things as you go along. 

That at least will help you make sure you are eating enough to support your metabolic processes, and actually help you lose weight. There are some other things I would suggest for your diet: 

Quite simply, no. In order to understand why, you have to understand the metabolic pathways used in exercise. If there are slight differences in the amount of calories burned, it is due merely to the difference in energy needed to move the lungs. Essentially, your muscles use Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to perform their work. The different metabolic pathways all result in generating ATP. The three major pathways are: 

If that's your whole diet, then that's the reason you are having problems. The diet is very unbalanced, and does not support your desire to get strong and have a great physique. 

Unfortunately, without further information on why you had that incident, it will be very difficult to help come up with a plan for recovering that level of cardiovascular health. One approach that can help you get back, slowly, is: 

There is no one size fits all answer. The various running apps may integrate with MyFitnessPal, or Fitocracy. There are some apps that also integrate with your Withing's scale or FitBit. So if you run, you have options available to you. However, if you lift, there isn't anything I'm aware of that allows you to compare and contrast across apps. There are fairly large technical issues that affect whether this is even feasible. For example, what units does one site use vs. another? Are the units just a label? This second issue is what makes JEFit difficult for me to use because it doesn't really convert metric and imperial measurements, it just slaps the unit name on the end of the number. The bigger question is whether it's healthy for you to compare yourself against others: 

It is doomed to fail. The only types of diet that can dip that low in calories while still being safe are ones that work on the pancreatic function. In short, if you have the amount of protein your body needs to maintain muscle mass, and very little carbs, then your body will go into a state of Ketosis. This is the principle behind the Get Shredded diet, the Atkins diet, the Ideal Protein diet, and the Lindora diet. In ketosis, the following things happen: 

Can you apply the approach to other exercises? Absolutely. You may have to adjust the between set time based on how much time it takes to get into position, but it's not a bad way to train. Just understand that no training style will work forever. When you stop getting results change to a different approach. When that stops working you might be able to come back to this and start seeing results again. 

Over emphasis on any one macro nutrient is going to work against you, and it appears you have a big emphasis on carbohydrates. So my answer is not against carbs, but more in keeping everything balanced. Bottom Line You have to eat fewer Calories than you burn to lose weight. No amount of carb cycling, ketosis, paleo, or whatever diet is going to work if you are eating more Calories than you burn. Training Your circuit training is primarily conditioning related work. This is similar to what Crossfit does for you: you work hard, have a limited measured rest, and go again until the circuit is completed. This is interval training. You have the following benefits: 

original answer: It really depends on the type of workout. For high heart rate workouts like running and swimming, it's good to replenish your carbs since you more than likely burned them all up exercising. In that case any fruit will help replenish your carbs--as will a sports drink. That said, for all workouts some form of protein post workout is also beneficial. The chief reason being that the muscles that were just worked will be looking for more protein to build themselves back up for next time. It's absolutely critical to have protein if you are strength training. Bananas and potatoes are also high in potassium, which can really help deal with muscle cramps. If you experience those regularly, you might be potassium deficient. You'll have to replenish that after working out. Unfortunately, there is no one-size fits all answer. 

If you have a Caloric deficit of 1200 Calories a week, and the body is pulling half from fat and half from muscle tissue, you will burn a pound of muscle while only burning less than a quarter of a pound of fat. This isn't good. Again, this is also grossly oversimplified. Bottom line is that we have to do something to protect the muscle. This is where the high protein content of your diet comes to play. The body doesn't really care if the protein it is consuming is dietary or from your existing muscles/organs. It's just going to create ketone bodies using both the protein and the fat. Sufficiently high protein, and you can actually gain some muscle mass. An additional benefit of protein is that it is very thermogenic, or in other words it takes a lot of energy to process. You burn more Calories digesting protein than you do carbohydrates and fat. NOTE: part of the process of digesting protein requires calcium. If you don't have enough dietary or supplementary calcium, you may end up leaching that calcium from your bones. This is particularly troublesome for women as they have a greater risk of osteoporosis anyway. A big influence on the way your body processes energy has to do with a pair of hormones: insulin and glucagon. Insulin is anabolic, which means it's job is to build up. It operates by taking elevated blood sugar and pushing it to the muscles and organs. However, if both the muscles and organs are full, the only place left is fat cells. Glucagon has the opposite responsibility, and is catabolic, meaning it's job is to tear down. It operates to restore blood sugar to normal levels by taking energy out of the muscles, organs, and fat cells. The energy in muscles and organs is glycogen. The energy in fat cells is fat. In a ketogenic diet, you are depleting the glycogen stores so that the only place left to pull energy is the fat stores. There are a few areas of concern here, which affect active people more than sedentary people:
