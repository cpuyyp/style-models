Xenophon paints more or less the same picture, but is quite more critical of Theramenes and Thrasybulus, and notes that the proceedings were rushed and the generals were not granted a full hearing: 

2007's biopic El Greco claims the painter was put on trial by the Spanish Inquisition, more specifically Grand Inquisitor Fernando Niño de Guevara, for blasphemy. The film is a heavily fictionalized version of the painter's life and doesn't necessarily claim historical accuracy. Nevertheless the tribunal (and acquittal) is the film's major plot element and since it was largely successful (in Greece and Spain), the painter's struggles with the Inquisition are sometimes quoted as fact. This, however, is quite hard to believe. El Greco would occasionally be invited to tribunals as an interpreter for Greek speaking defendants, and the Grand Inquisitor is most probably the subject of the painter's Portrait of a Cardinal. His relationship with the Inquisition seems to have been generally amicable, and it would have been highly unlikely he could continue producing works with religious themes if he had any kind of troubles with the Catholic Church. Is there any record of El Greco ever having troubles with the Inquisition during his time in Toledo? 

The biggest issue in deciphering the Indus script is that the average length of the known inscriptions is less than five signs, with the longest one containing only 17 non repeating signs: 

Whatever happened, and whoever is to blame, all accounts seem to suggest that the trial was highly irregular, a product of the politically charged environment of the later half of the war. Trials of Athenian generals after significant defeats were not uncommon, and a notable example during the war is Thucydides exile, after he failed to reach Amphipolis in time. That said, during the war most Athenian generals that were involved in significant defeats died in battle (or were executed by their enemies shortly after), and thus it's not easy to assume a general reaction of the Athenians towards defeated generals. Interestingly Conon, who had failed in facing the Spartan fleet in Lesbos and later presided over the defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami, never faced charges. The aftermath of the Battle of Arginusae is the only example of a trial of generals after a significant victory and along with the trial of Socrates are the two prime examples of questionable decisions by the Athenian judiciary. 

Although Herodotus claims a Cretan origin2 for Lycurgus' laws, the Oracle and divine favour still feature prominently. Lycurgus status remains enigmatic, although he is mentioned by name in several other sources, including Thucidides History of the Peloponnesian War, Plato's Laws, Phaedrus, and the Republic, and Aristotle's Rhetoric. Aristotle also alludes to the fact that the Spartans weren't big fans of learning in general: 

While Mein Kampf isn't really what I'd consider a historical source, Hitler's hatred of the Jews is evident in almost every page and I think the above quotes prove that at least he didn't consider chemical weapons a "Jewish" method of warfare. As for the lack use of chemical weapons by Nazi Germany in general, we shouldn't forget that Germany and Austria were signatories of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare 2 (17 June, 1925) that prohibited the use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare. While the Geneva Protocol prohibited first use, it didn't prohibited research, manufacturing and storage of chemical weapons and all combatants had access to various chemical agents at the time. Research on chemical warfare was active during Hitler's reign, Tabun was discovered in 1936 and production of the substance started in 1942, Sarin was discovered in 1938 and at least 500 kg of it were produced by the Waffenamt, and research continued as late as 1944, when Soman was discovered. British Intelligence has recently (June 2011) released a series of reports that suggest Nazi Germany was planning to use chemical warfare in their planned invasion of the UK. The files are available online, here's a screenshot for posterity: 

The assumption that the object in the soldier's right wrist is a watch is not entirely safe; for all we know it's a wrist worn compass, and more specifically an Adrianov compass. Adrianov compasses were pretty common with Red Army soldiers, and they would have been worn on the right wrist. From a distance, a soldier wearing a compass would look like wearing two watches. Yevgeny Khaldei (the photographer) had a history of manipulating his photographs for a variety of reasons (aesthetics and propaganda being the obvious ones). In fact, the removal of the watch or compass is not the only alteration; the smoke in the background was added later. Unfortunately, Khaldei refused to comment on the alterations, and we can't be absolutely certain for his intentions. Furthermore, the iconic photograph may not even depict an actual historic moment. Michael Griffin, in the "The Great War Photographs: Constructing Myths of History and Photojournalism" chapter of Picturing the Past: Media, History, and Photography argues that the photograph was orchestrated by Khaldei who had carried the large flag with him to Berlin, hoping to create a photograph similar to the Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima one. 

The convention was established by Ptolemy (AD 90 – c. AD 168) in his main work, Geography. The following is a 15th century reconstruction of Ptolemy's world map: 

In contrast, the Ancient Greeks aren't thought of as being particularly tolerant towards people with disabilities. They were a far more militaristic society than the generally peaceful Egyptians, and ascribed great importance to physical prowess. When it comes to deafness and muteness, matters were extremely complicated. The Greeks considered their language to be perfect and anyone who couldn't speak it, including deaf and mute people, barbarians. That said, the actual behaviour of the Greeks towards the deaf is a matter of debate. Most quotes, including Aristotle's, use the word "ἐνεος" (or various forms of) that translates to "speechless" to refer to the deaf. The prevalent opinion among historians is that "ἐνεος" had a double meaning and may have often been used pejoratively, thus most English translations favour "dumb" instead of "speechless" when translating "ἐνεος". Raymond Hull challenges that notion in Aural Rehabilitation: Serving Children & Adults, and posits3 that what eventually became the main interpretation of Aristotle's statements on the matter may very well be a misinterpretation stemming from the dual meaning of "ἐνεος". In any case, Aristotle's philosophy on deafness is summarized in the following quotes: 

While the first quote implies hygienic reasons, every other quote is about fashion and personal vanity ("I never till this day observed that the King is mighty gray."). Hans Zinsser, in Rats, Lice and History suggests that wigs, or more accurately the fact that men shaved their heads to wear them, protected them from lice. However, Samuel Pepys doesn't seem to agree, he regularly had to clean his wigs from lice: 

A prime example would be the Siege of Malta by the Ottomans in 1565. The Ottomans outnumbered the defenders 5 to 1, according to the numbers given by Francisco Balbi di Correggio, but did not succeed in conquering the island. 

Lastly, information on sleeper agents are even more sporadic and even less trustworthy. Up until 2010, there were no confirmed cases of Soviet or Russian sleeper agents in the US. In June 2010 however 10 individuals were arrested and identified as Russian agents, a network that has been since known as the Illegals Program. They were operating as illegal resident spies, continuing the long tradition of the (now defunct) KGB. None of them were ranked officials, they were all civilians, however some were alleged to have family ties with members of the FIS or former members of the KGB. 

Looking at that royal mess, and considering the hereditary nature of heraldry, I think it's quite obvious how we ended up with only two main symbols of European monarchy, the lion and the eagle. That said, and while the choice of the eagle is easily explained, the lion is a bit more enigmatic and I don't think we can do much more than speculate. The use of lions might have been widespread in the House of Normandy, and the first known use of the lion in coat of arms in a hereditary fashion comes from one of the dynasty's members, Henry I of England. When Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou was knighted in 1127, according to Wikipedia: 

Again according to Plutarch, Lycurgus laws were of divine origin, having been passed at him from the Oracle at Delphi: 

Artistic depictions of the character may be based on any of the countless versions of the legend. And of course as with any fictional character some artistic license can be assumed, you can't really expect complete historical accuracy in art. If you are interested in Goethe's version and assuming Goethe followed contemporary fashion in his works, you'll need to research German fashion in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This image, from the Wikipedia article on 1795–1820 in fashion, shows a German gentleman in 1815: 

1 Interestingly, there is a total of eight battles that are known as "Battle of Thermopylae". 2 Ironically, Marinatos' excavanations were interrupted by the 1941 Battle of Thermopylae. 

Herodotus' Histories is the primary source for the second Persian invasion of Greece, which started with the famous1 Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC. Herodotus describes the battle in Book 7 (Polymnia) of the Histories, starting at paragraph 175: 

The Peloponnesian War (431 to 404 BC) was a testing time for the Athenian judicial system, every victory brought forth new heroes and every loss new scapegoats. The Athenians had lost their strongest asset, the leadership of Pericles, when the plague hit the city in the first year of the war, the lack of an experienced successor and the physical and mental exhaustion of the population from the plague created fertile ground for demagoguery and slander. Cleon, Pericles' immediate successor, and Demosthenes were regularly lampooned by Aristophanes, and Nicias, although largely responsible for the peace treaty that ended the first part of the war, had little success in battle. Alcibiades rise to prominence during the interlude and the second part of the war is a tale of intense political struggle, and in one way or the other involves all the principals of the trial of the generals. Both Theramenes and Thrasybulus were his allies, the three men had fought side by side in several battles of the war, and were all involved in the coup of 411 BC. Theramenes was part of the short lived oligarchy of the Four Hundred that followed the coup, and remains an enigmatic and highly controversial figure, but there's little doubt that at the time of the Battle of Arginusae both he and Thrasybulus were extremely influential. Alcibiades alone, who had returned to Athens only a year prior to the Battle of Arginusae, following his defection to Sparta after he was condemned to death in absentia during the ill fated Sicilian Expedition, was an extremely powerful ally and one that had proven in the past that was quite capable of manipulating the assembly in his favour. Nevertheless, the aftermath of the Battle of Arginusae is atypical, even in the uncertain climate of the later half of an unprecedentedly long war. By Xenophon's account the Athenian victory was quite unexpected, the Athenian fleet was essentially a relief squadron, hastily assembled while the main fleet under Conon was blockaded by the Spartans in Mytilene, in the island of Lesbos:
