I have a question about weak factorization of birational maps (in characteristic zero). If $X_1 \to X_2$ is a birational map of smooth varieties, it was proved some time ago that we can decompose it into a sequence of blowups and blowdowns with smooth centers. Now, suppose that $X_1, X_2$ are resolutions of the same $Y$, so they admit a birational morphism to $Y$. Can we find a factorization into blowups and blowdowns so that on each intermediate step we also have a morphism to $Y$? Is this written up somewhere? 

Let $E$ be a rank $r$ bundle on a quasiprojective scheme. There is a natural map $$ \Lambda^r H^0(E) \to H^0(\Lambda^r E) $$ It does not have to be surjective as can be seen from the case when $E$ is a direct sum of line bundles. However, is it true that $E$ can always be twisted by an ample line bundle so that this map becomes surjective? 

You may want to look at curves in three dimensional projective space. I vaguely remember, although I may be wrong, that there was a component with general member non-reduced. 

If G is finite, do you need to take the GIT quotient? Maybe just the usual categorical would work. A necessary condition is that for any point x of P(V) its stabilizer acts trivially on the fiber of your line bundle at x. The stabilizer would also be finite, and its action on the one-dimensional fiber factors through the quotient by the commutator subgroup. Since the values of the one dimensional representation homomorphism must be roots of unity, after taking appropriate tensor power the action will become trivial. Say, if you consider O(n) where n is the order of G. 

As you point out, it follows on general grounds that there is an extension of $v_p$ to a valuation on ${\mathbb R}$ (in fact, there are uncountably many such extensions), but it is impossible to give an "explicit" description. Indeed, not only will any such extension by discontinuous with respect to the usual Euclidean topology on the reals, but it will not be a measurable function. 

I think that the simplest explanation has nothing to do with schemes: the first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a fixed characteristic is complete. The assertion that the group of $k$-points $G(k)$ of the algebraic group $G$ has $n$ orbits on the set of $k$-points $X(k)$ of the algebraic variety $X$ may be naturally expressed as a first-order logical formula and hence is true in one algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$ just in case it is true in every such algebraically closed field. 

As you point out, one cannot hope that the Witt ring, up to isomorphism, be an elementary invariant of a field. The strongest statement which I might conjecture would be that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then $W(K) \to W(L)$ is an elementary extension of rings. If this statement were true, then the theory of the Witt ring would be an elementary invariant as any two elementarily equivalent fields have a common elementary extension. It is true that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then map $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is an inclusion [Why? Being zero in the Witt ring is defined by an existential condition.] One might try to prove that $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is elementary by induction where the key step would be to show that if $W(L) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$ where $a$ is a tuple from $W(K)$, $x$ is a single variable, and $\phi$ is a formula in the language of rings, then $W(K) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$. The witness in $W(L)$ would be represented by a quadratic space of some finite dimension $n$. One would like to argue that the set defined by $\phi(x;a)$ in the space of $n$-dimensional quadratic forms is definable in the field language in $K$ in which case a witness could be found in $K$ via elementarity. This last part of the argument is delicate as it would require knowing bounds for checking equalities in the Witt ring. The Witt ring construction is an example of an ind-definable set modulo an ind-definable equivalence relation. These are discussed in some detail in Hrushovski's paper on approximate groups ( arXiv:0909.2190 ). With Krajiceck, I considered similar issues (how does the Grothendieck ring of a first-order structure depend on its theory) in Combinatorics with definable sets: Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings. Bull. Symbolic Logic 6 (2000), no. 3, 311--330. 

The closest I have seen to what you are asking, is the paper Hübl, Reinhold; Yekutieli, Amnon Adelic Chern forms and applications. Amer. J. Math. 121 (1999), no. 4, 797–839. Not quite Riemann-Roch, but probably the right approach. 

It's probably a very simple question but I am not sure about the reference. In the definition of a balanced monoidal category we require that the braiding isomorphims $$c_{V, W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$$ are not arbitrary but admit twisting isomorphisms $\theta_V: V \to V$ which, in a way, represent $c_{V, W} c_{W, V}$ as a coboundary. Does it mean that from the homotopy point of view, existence of a twisting makes the category symmetric monoidal in the sense of $\infty$-categories? 

Suppose that A is an associative algebra, but not Frobenius. Does the Cyclic Cohomology of A have a structure of a BV algebra? All results I could find first identify A with its dual but I am asking about a general associative A. 

Lurie proves that formal $E_\infty$ moduli problems over a field $k$ are equivalent to augmented $E_\infty$-algebras. Is there a reasonably small model for this when $k = \mathbb{F}_p$? Or maybe we could have a similar, but different, statement where we start with moduli problems over [commutative algebras with additional Steenrod operations], and on the output we get a suitably modified category of dg Lie algebras? 

Some comments (1) On this site there was a question "Why a smooth surjective morphism of schemes admits a section etale-locally?"; so smoothness gives some kind of nice property here. (2) Even for smooth morphisms, over complex numbers one may not have a Zariski local section (even in the case when the fiber is a projective space). (3) For an arbitrary morphism there is no hope for a global section - consider the case of a blowup of a point on a projective space. 

There are several rich theories of analysis on non-archimedian theories. Neal Koblitz' book on $p$-adic analysis is a good introduction. Non-archimedian analysis by Bosch, Güntzer and Remmert is more encyclopedic. Berkovich's Spectral Theory and Analysis over Non-archimedian Fields introduces his beautiful theory of analytic spaces allowing for a reasonable algebraic topological theory. In Goss's book Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic there is a good introduction to analysis in positive characteristic. Your suggestion that this subject might have something to do with model theory is apt. As the above references show, the theory may be developed without model theory, but it has been studied intensively via model theory giving interesting results about quantifier elimination, uniformity across the $p$-adics, and establishing a basis for motivic integration. You might want to look at the paper by van den Dries and Denef, $p$-adic and real subanalytic sets. Ann. of Math. (2) 128 (1988), no. 1, 79--183. 

To say that $x \neq \varnothing$ is exactly to assert $(\exists y) y \in x$ and the truth of this existential formula will be witnessed by some set $a$ for which $a \in x$. Thus, the set $f := \lbrace \langle x, a \rangle \rbrace$ is a function from $\lbrace x \rbrace$ to $x$. [I think that this point, namely that the Axiom of Choice is not used to instantiate the truth of an existential formula by naming a witness is the heart of your question. I am not claiming that there will be a constructive choice of the witness. It is just that if an existential formula is true, there must be a witness.] More generally, to prove that if $F$ is a finite set of nonempty sets, then $\prod F := \lbrace f : f \text{ a function with dom}(f) = F \text{ such that } (\forall x \in F) f(x) \in x \rbrace$ is non-empty one argues by induction. If $F = \varnothing$, then the empty function is an element of $\prod F$. If $\text{card}(F) = n+1$, then we may express $F = F' \cup \lbrace x \rbrace$ as disjoint union where $\text{card}(F') = n$. As $x \neq \varnothing$, from the calculation above we find some $f:\lbrace x \rbrace \to x$. By induction, there is some $g \in \prod F'$. I will leave it to you to exhibit a bijection between $\prod F$ and $(\prod F') \times \prod \lbrace x \rbrace$ and thereby complete the argument. 

Is there a transparent explanation of why the singular cochain complex of a topological space X is an $E_\infty$ algebra. There are combinatorial proofs using, say, the surjection operad, but is there a topological picture behind those? If we wanted to restrict,say, to the level of little (2-)discs, could we describe the structure using something like Eilenberg-Zilber contractions of $C^*(X^m)$ onto $C^*(X)^{\otimes m}$, various diagonal maps and so on? 

I have a smooth projective morphism $X \to S$ or relative dimension 1 (i.e. a family of smooth curves over base $S$). There should be a map $H^2(X, K_2) \to H^1(S, K_1) = Pic(S)$ given by integration along the fibers (the cohomology is in the Zariski topology and $K_i$ are the Zariski sheaves of algebraic $K$-theories). In other words, some kind of global version of the symbol map in $K$-theory. Is this written up somewhere? The only thing I have seen is a paper by Brylinsky and someone else, where they take two rational functions $f$ and $g$ and cook up a number, froom values of $f$ at zeros and poles of $g$, and values of $g$ at zeros and poles of $f$. 

Let $[x:y:z:w]$ be the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and suppose that the point blown up is given by the vanishing of the first three coordinates. Introduce a projective plane with coordinates $[X:Y:Z]$ then the blowup is a closed subset in $\mathbb{P}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equations $$ xY = yX; xZ = zX; yZ = zY. $$ The bundle $\mathcal{O}(1) \boxtimes \mathcal{O}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^2$gives the Segre Embedding, so it is very ample on the product of projective spaces. Its restriction to the blowup is also very ample and it must be of the form $dH - k E$. We can computed $d$ and $k$ by intersecting with (a) a line in $\mathbb{P}^3$ that avoids the point blown up, which gives $d = 2$; and (b) with a line in the exceptional fiber $[0:0:0:1] \times \mathbb{P}^2$, which gives $k=1$. So $2H - E$ is very ample. 

As far as I understand, no, Vaught's Conjecture has not been resolved. We held a reading seminar on Robin Knight's proposed counter-example closely following each of his drafts and simplified presentations here at Berkeley some years ago and were ultimately convinced that the draft of January 2003 does not contain a correct disproof of Vaught's Conjecture and requires more than minor emendations to produce a complete proof. We did not discover any essential error, though there were important points in the argument where it seemed to us that even the author had not worked out the technical details. That said, it is possible that revisions he has posted since then are sufficient, though in view of how much time it would require to enter into the details of the argument, I am not willing to work through the later papers until the basic architecture of the proof is certified by some other expert. To be fair to Robin Knight, his work in set theoretic topology is well-respected and his construction takes into account the relevant features required for a counter-example to Vaught's Conjecture. If you would like to know whether or not he believes that his proof works, you should ask him directly. If he says that he does believe the proof to be valid, then you can attempt to check the proof yourself. The difficulty in reading his manuscript is not the amount of background material one must know in order to follow it, but exactly the opposite: almost everything is developed from scratch so that one must hold the entire construction in one's mind without having the usual anchors of established theorems. 

If the theory $T$ proves (for some natural number $n \in {\mathbb Z}_+$) the sentence $$(\forall y_0) \cdots (\forall y_n) \bigvee_{0 \leq i < j \leq n} y_i = y_j$$ then every mcodel of $T$ will be an interpretation with a finite domain. Otherwise, the compactness theorem in the language ${\mathcal L}(\{ c_i : i \in {\mathbb N} \})$ where ${\mathcal L}$ is the language of $T$ and the $c_i$'s are new constant symbols applied to the set of sentences $$T \cup \{ c_i \neq c_j : 0 \leq i < j \in {\mathbb N} \}$$ shows that there must be infinite models of $T$. 

Unless you know that $F'$ has a finite locally free resolution, and this will tend to fail when $F'$ is the skyscraper sheaf of a singular point. But maybe you just want to work with $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $X$. 

It is known that a flasque sheaf on a topological space has trivial cohomology. Suppose that we are in a relative situation of a smooth fibration $\pi: X \to S$ and $F$ is a sheaf on $X$. Is there are weaker condition on $F$ which implies that the higher direct images to $S$ are trivial (but not necessarily the cohomology groups of $F$ on $X$). 

(Trying to rephrase an earlier question) In topology, a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ has a ``homotopy cofiber" $Cf$ included in a cofiber sequence $$ X \to Y \to Cf \to \Sigma X \to \Sigma Y \to \Sigma CF \to \ldots $$ when $f$ is a cofibration, the cofiber is homotopy equivalent to $X/Y$. Now, if $Y$ is a category, say, of modules over a ring $R$, and $f$ a functor from another category (e.g. embedding of projective modules into all modules), is there a similar cofiber category and a cofiber sequence? 

I am reading two papers by Daniel Grayson: "Localization for flat modules in algebraic K-theory" and "Algebraic cycles and algebraic K-theory" and I am wondering if any recent advances in K-theory can extend the results a bit. Specifically, suppose $\pi: X \to S$ is a smooth projective morphism of relative dimension 2. Mimicking Corollary 1.6 in the second paper, can we write an exact complex of sheaves $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_3 (X) \to \mathcal{K}_3^{0/1}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{1/2}(X/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^2(X/S) \to 0? $$ The sheaves involved are sheafification of K-theory in Zariski or etale topology. The last term is K-theory of coherent sheaves flat over $S$ with support of relative codimension 2 (i.e. support finite over $S$). The two intermediate terms are some kind of relative K-theory for the pairs built from coherent sheaves (flat over $S$) with support of relative codimension 0 (resp. 1) and its subcategory of sheaves with support of relative codimension 1 (resp. 2). In fact, I am OK with a resolution of this nature where the two middle terms can be a bit more obscure than stated, as long as the first and the last terms remain the same. An alternative: when $Y \to S$ is a flat family of projective curves, but not necessarily smooth, is there an analogue of the resolution $$ 0 \to \mathcal{K}_2(Y) \to \mathcal{K}_2^{0/1}(Y/S) \to \mathcal{K}_1^1(Y/S) \to 0 $$ stated in Corollary 1.6 for the case when $Y$ is relatively smooth over $S$? Again, it's OK if the middle term gets a bit more obscure, as long as the other two survive (maybe with the correction that the first term is K-theory of coherent sheaves, not of projective modules).
