Now you need to follow up and get these questions answered. If you haven't heard within a week, call and ask. 

If you are self-employed as a European company (or employed by a European company), my understanding is that you don't need any US permits to get remote work. My companies (current and past) have often outsourced work to offshore companies with cheaper labor costs. US work permits were not required for those workers, since they never worked directly for the US companies, and never worked in the US. We did bring them in for some training, and it was necessary to limit their time in the US, and to make sure they only trained and didn't actually work. Good luck. 

This one is easy. Let all of your references know of your name change, before they are contacted. This is what everyone I know who changed their name has done. And it hasn't ever been an issue for them. 

So overall, not illegal, but rather odd, in my opinion. It's possible this is a sign of an odd culture at the company. Or (perhaps more likely) the interviewers are poorly trained in good interview practices. Still only you can decide what "acceptable" means to you here - you can decide that it isn't acceptable and bow out of consideration for this position. You can decide that it is acceptable and continue. 

Things happen. Offers can sometimes fall through for several reasons. Hiring managers can understand that. If you go back to hiring managers in a timely manner, you might be able to pick up where you left off. Even if you can't, the fact that you have gotten this interest from some potential employers almost certainly means that you could do so with others as well. If you are really that concerned, or perhaps have some other (undisclosed) reasons for believing that your verbal offer will fall through, then keep interviewing at new companies. Just don't accept another offer until you have heard from the one you already accepted. If you do get a second offer, call the current company and tell them you need the written offer quickly. But I suspect you are over-thinking this one, and worrying unnecessarily. Written offers take time. Try to be patient for a while. (Note: As @WesleyLong's tale suggests, never give notice at your current company until your new offer is completely tied up - in writing. Although it seems in your case you are new to the professional world and don't have a current company that needs a notice, this is good advice for others.) 

Just ask. Something like "Boss. The new location you are transferring me to has a much higher cost of living. I'd like a pay adjustment so that I'm not unfairly burdened in the process." (Ask for an "adjustment" rather than a "raise" - it sounds more appropriate for the context.) You could even go online to a cost of living calculator site like $URL$ (or your local equivalent) so you'll know how much you should ask for if the question arises. Remember, the fact that you were living with parents and now won't isn't the company's problem here. They may make an accommodation for that, but probably not. Then listen. Often, companies have money set aside for such purposes. But sometimes, they expect attrition, and are willing to let folks who don't want to bear the increased costs leave. You will only know by asking. 

Other than a short burst of "Ha, take that!" and feeling a bit better for a moment or two, what possible good can come of a late retort to your annual review? If you had said something during the initial discussion, that might have been better. But you were silent then, you are now planning to leave - there is no value in going back and making counter-claims. You already know that you won't change anyone's mind - why would you care if someone thinks you agree with their assessment or not? Time to stay silent, put this behind you, find your next position, leave on as good terms as you can, and move on. For your own benefit, you may want to think the situation through and learn for yourself how you and your manager could come to such different conclusions. My thoughts are that there should never be any surprises during an Annual Review. If there are, then neither party has communicated well enough during the past year. 

Happiness is personal. You can choose to look on the bright side "Hey, I'm making 3% more today!" or the dark side "Only 3%. That's how much my personal cost of living has increased, so it's like getting nothing." My personal cost of living increase is almost certainly not the same as yours. Some people are paying a lot of rapidly-increasing health care costs, for example. Some people are saving for college educations that are rising more rapidly than inflation. Others are living a life that isn't getting much more expensive the past year or so. Happiness is very context sensitive. In my company, 3% has been the norm for the past few years. But I also remember a time when single-digit raises were devastating, and a clear sign that you needed to move on to keep up with inflation. 

If you don't have the self-discipline, then take the course nights and weekends and get it done in 3 months. You would have a far more compelling story to tell potential employers that way. 

You'll almost certainly be asked why you want to leave your current company. As long as you have a good answer, it's not usually necessary to provide the details in your cover letter. Leaving a comfortable position won't necessarily be seen as a positive. Don't give a potential employer a reason to think about why you'll leave them. 

Do a quick internet search, looking for the prices of the same version of a used computer. Offer whatever it would cost for you to purchase the same computer on the open market. The company may or may not be willing to sell their equipment (in my experience these days, most are not willing to sell). But if they are willing they will tell you if your offer is fair or not. The company may have to nuke the computer first. Depending on their licensing arrangements for the software, they may not have the right to pass it on to others. And if they aren't willing to sell, at least you now know where to go to purchase one yourself. 

I once performed a reference check on a candidate. The person I spoke to casually mentioned that the candidate's nickname was "zipperhead" (the candidate was not Asian, but had a scar from a motorcycle head injury). In my circles, that wouldn't be a term of endearment. So I spoke to the candidate, and mentioned what the reference had said. The candidate explained that his reference was also a childhood buddy, and kidded around like that all the time. I ended up hiring "zipperhead" - and he turned out quite well. In the unlikely event that the saboteur actually contacts this company, I can't imagine the hiring manager just dropping you from consideration without giving you a chance to speak for yourself. And should the hiring manager take a random caller's word without providing a chance for you to speak, it seems to me that you wouldn't want to work for such a manager anyway. If it were me, I wouldn't be worried. (Note: I understand how the word "zipperhead" might be used these days. The person in question wasn't of Asian decent. And I don't think that term had that context in those days (it was a number of years ago). The individual had a head injury from a motorcycle accident that left a scar. That was how his references used the term. Still not nice, but nothing at all racial about it. Just some goofy friends.) 

That depends on why they aren't currently providing the desired outcomes now. If these team members know that only practical recommendations should be provided and they know how to provide practical, rather than idealistic, solutions, then they simple aren't doing the job that is required. They should be mentored individually, in private. Their shortcomings should be pointed out. They should be told that they must correct their actions. And if they still don't then they need to be removed from their positions. On the other hand if they don't know that only practical recommendations should be provided, then you need to explain that to them. Talk to them about the difference between idealistic and practical. Explain why only the latter is appropriate. Then follow up to make sure they understand and are following the expectations. If instead they know that practical recommendations are required but don't know how to produce them, then you need to set up one or more training sessions to teach them how to produce the results you want. One way to train them would be to pick specific situations they could encounter, explain the ideal solution, then work together to brainstorm practical solutions. Again, you need to then follow up to make sure the trainings are implemented properly. Some internal audits provide two types of output - the ideal and the practical. I have read audit reports like this. They provide a long-term goal of approaching a more ideal situation, while providing shorter-term, more practical remediation requirements. You may wish to explore that as a way to satisfy the auditors' understandable need to point out the "really great" solutions while giving the department the more achievable solutions they need now. 

Sometimes, I'll handle the technical/domain/culture assessment myself - depending on the nature of the role being filled and the availability of others to help. If you aren't in a position to assess technical fit, and you aren't the manager, you might be better suited to fill the domain or company culture role. If you are in the domain role, you ask questions related to the domain in which your company works. For example, you might be hiring a DBA to work in a Pharmaceutical company. In this role, you would talk to the candidate about the pharmaceutical industry. You would be learning what the candidate understands about the industry, if it is of interest, and if it fits the candidate. If you are in the company culture role, you ask and answer questions as to the candidate's fit into your company's culture. For example, if you are a startup company, you might problem to see if the candidate is comfortable in a startup environment (where perhaps not everything is pre-defined, and it might be necessary to pitch in and work in areas outside your comfort zone). Also remember that these interviewers are there to answer questions, as well as to ask them. If you have been in the company/department for a while, you may be able to provide answers to the candidates that will show them what a great company you have and why they should want to work there. Hiring is important, particularly in a small shop. IMHO, a good hire is well worth a few hours of extra work. 

No. Not unless you were lying about the minimum you would accept. You don't want to work for a company that is paying less than what you need. Perhaps next time such a question won't catch you off guard, and you'll have your answer ready.
