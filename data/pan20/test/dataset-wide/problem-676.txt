A road groupset usually consists of a number of parts. There are not many tools, and they are generally not that expensive. With all the resources out there (youtube, sheldon brown website, etc) and basic mechanical aptitude it isn't a difficult task. You need basic hand/bike tools, (hammer, metric allen keys/drivers, screwdrivers, pliers, socket set, torque wrench, etc) In terms of specific tools for those components: 

Get a power meter and see what output you are getting at various rpm / loads. There is a big difference of 120rpm at 200w or 600w. This relationship will most likely not be linear. 150 rpm seems much too high, but everyone is different. I personally find great power at 105-120. Timing yourself or using HR can be a measure as well, but power is the only way to know for sure. 

Mind you, with top of the line brand new components it is much easier than potentially old and rusty equipment. 

Many individuals are running non matching hollowtech II stages crank arms with no ill effects. Stages themselves cites this as OK. Note the Dura-Ace crank below. Crank Compatibility: All Shimano Hollowtech II road cranks Go ahead and purchase with confidence and enjoy cycling with power. I run an Ultegra 6800 Stages on a 6700 Crankset personally. 

There is no video editing software from Shimano. The CSV is present, you should see it if you paired your sensors in the mobile app. I have used DashWare with success with my Shimano action camera, others have reported Garmin VIRB edit software works but I have not tried. 

The 6700 rear derailleur has more capacity and might fix your issue. OR: You can ditch the roadlink and use a Shimano 9spd MTB SGS RD. They work great with 10spd road shifters. I used 105 5700 shifters and an XT RD-M761 SGS RD and XT 10spd 11-36 cassette to get up Alpe d'Huez and some other epic climbs in France during summer 2015 and shifting was great! 

The ANT+ lights standard allows for "0" switches to turn on/off bike lights. (Besides the initial power on of the head unit) I run a bontrager flare rt with my edge 820 and it works great. Completely wireless, it automatically adjusts brightness, and even has a "brake light mode". 

An optional extra that would come in handy and for future work on the bike would be a bike workshop stand I spent 100$ on mine and it has been excellent for regular maintenance and upgrading parts. 

64 watts is well within the margin of error of 60w target. Don't be afraid of going to your lowest gear on the trainer. You should be working up to your target cadence, if you can't hold 90 without bouncing then you should aim for something lower. It will take time to get up there. 60w is relatively low for most people, it may become easier for you to hold a higher cadence at more watts. Trainerroad philosophy is to focus on the power, especially in your intervals. Bouncing and poor form won't help you get faster. 

I just bought a new bicycle. While I was fiddling with things (removing tags, mounting a light, etc.) I noticed that the boot on the rear brake cable was loose. When trying to reseat it, I found that one of the strands of the brake cable was broken, and poking through the boot. Furthermore, the cable is un-twisted just before the bolt that clamps it to the right side of the brake. These seem like very bad things to me which I should immediately get fixed (and complain about). Am I correct? Is the bike unsafe to ride? 

I have a lock of the pictured design. The rubber rings at the ends of the U would be perfectly good for the job of pressing against the bar to keep it from rattling, except that they're not close enough to the bar to do that. I used rubber O-rings from the hardware store (found in faucet repair parts) as shims between the original thick rubber rings and the black sleeve over the main body of the U. The advantage of this approach over some of the other suggestions is that you are less likely to get stray material jammed in the interface between the U and the bar, because the supplied rubber rings are thick, close fitting, and otherwise suited for this job â€” just in need of a little spacer. (I originally used plastic cable ties, but those are too wide, have a lump at one point, and eventually failed under sunlight.) 

If I am riding down a marked bike lane on a road which is adjacent to the curb, and I need to stop for a very short time (e.g. to adjust something, turn on lights, or drink some water), how far should I get off the road? That is: As a car driver, if I had to stop I would move onto the shoulder of the road, or otherwise as far right (US, drive on the right) as is safe for the vehicle. With a bicycle lane, there is no specific shoulder, but I can pick up the bike and move off the road entirely. Should I take the time to do so, even if there is essentially no traffic? What if the lane is especially wide (e.g. if it is a bicycle lane to the left of parking space, but with no cars actually present), or if it is only a generously wide road without any markings? (I am looking for a safety and politeness perspective, not regional traffic laws, though if there is a general trend in law on the matter that is also useful information.) 

The geometry is the major problem with converting a road bike into a TT/Tri bike, road bikes have you sitting much farther back relative to the contact points on the handlebars. You may be able to offset this with a different seatpost that puts you farther forward (assuming saddle is adjusted all the way towards the front). Other changes may include a shorter stem, different saddle. You may be able to make your road bike work, just don't expect to be comfortable mid ride switching from the aerobars to the hoods/drops. You have to pick one and stick with it. 

SPD-SL is harder to clip out of than SPD (MTB style), it's just a fact of how it was designed. It improves slightly with time but it will never be as easy as SPD. 

Not sure why it hasn't been mentioned in the other answers but recumbents are generally much heavier than traditional frames and on steep gradients weight makes a big difference. Looks like a 2000$ recumbent is around 30lbs and a 2000$ road bike should be around 18lbs or so. 

The new Shimano Ultegra R8000 Cassette 11-34 fits the 11spd MTB freehub spacing. If you have the medium cage 5800 derailluer it will work as is. If not then you can upgrade to the R8000 medium cage and it will work with your 5800 shifters. 

I had a (improperly tightened) bolt drop out of a SPD cleat while riding which left me in the same predicament (also ended up eating asphalt), I ended up being able to wedge my shoe against the frame to get the appropriate leverage to kick the shoe/cleat combo out of the pedal. I would try attaching the pedal to a bike (and foot in shoe) and attempting the same move. You can always unscrew the pedal and take off the shoe to get back to where you are today. 

Here in the Toronto area, you can find these bikes either at a spring bike show or (more commonly) fall bike show. They are generally priced aggressively to clear out stock and you won't find many in the stores in the coming years. Most shops will not have previous model years around as they make money selling bikes and want to move stock. I also managed to find my girl's bike on Kijiji the same way that a shop just wanted to clear out last years model. 40% off. The final option is a few bike stores that sit on stock for years and they won't move on the price regardless and you won't convince them.
