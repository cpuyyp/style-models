Version #1.a seems to be completely unacceptable; and version #1.c seems weird--though, its subordinate clause does sound like it is an imperative clause. And so, the three subordinate clauses don't seem to be interchangeable here, and that gives more weight to not consider the original example #1's subordinate clause to be an imperative clause. CAVEAT: Though, it probably should be pointed out that a main clause imperative in a coordination might not always do so well here either. (Examples of imperatives in a coordination: Say what you like, it won't make any difference; You do that again and you'll regret it; Do that ever again and I'll brain you; Act in haste and repent at leisure; Come over here and you'll be able to see better; You hurry up or we'll be late.) But from those examples, the only one that I'm seeing as being awkward is "You come over here and you'll be able to see better". What it might be: Example #1 might be an attempt by the speaker to combine an emphatic DO with a subjunctive clause. That is, the "do" in "It's important [that you do not be late]" might be an emphatic "do"; though, it does seem to be unnecessary. I'm thinking this because example #1 seems to convey the same meaning as the (subjunctive) mandative. Example #1 might look a little bit unusual, but otherwise, it doesn't sound too bad to me (AmE speaker). 

I am living in China and studying Chinese. The question is a good one insofar as the misconception is very widespread. I have heard educated people say such a thing, i.e. Chinese has no grammar, people who should know better. Interestingly, however, the source of the misconception originates from both outside and inside of China. The first books written by Westerners about the Chinese language were authored by missionaries during the Ming Dynasty in the 1600s. These missionaries had probably studied Latin and Greek, highly inflected languages. They were interested in spreading Christianity, and in order to do this, they needed to speak Chinese, so they studied it. If one is used to Latin or Greek grammar, then Chinese is undoubtedly a shock due to the almost complete lack of morphological markers. Chinese is quite analytical; it lacks inflections almost entirely. In this regard, it is understandable how those missionaries might have claimed that Chinese lacks grammar. But the misconception that Chinese lacks grammar also stems from within the country. There has been, namely, a considerable school of thought that tries to make sense of cultural differences in terms of language (think Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis). Some Chinese scholars have characterized Chinese as a "spiritual", "non-formal", "flexible" language, whereas European languages have been characterized as "formal" and "rigid". This understanding of language has certainly contributed to the misconception that Chinese lacks grammar. Worth noting in this area is that the misconception was relatively prominent in Chinese linguistics not long ago. In fact the misconception was being propogated in recent decades, for example in "General Linguistics" by Shen Xiao Long: $URL$ I haven't read this book, but my colleague states that it was influential. My colleague also states that the modern understanding of grammar did not really begin to take hold in China until after the Cultural Revolution. It was therefore not until the 1980s that the modern understanding of grammar started to spread in China. 

In my education, I've learned about a lot of languages whose case systems have atrophied, especially from PIE. Wikipedia had a reference to The Evolution of Case Systems for Marking Event Structure, but that was focused on language games (abstract below): 

Some of the most common differences listed about Pacific Northwest English are phonological in nature, the Mary-merry-marry and cot-caught mergers, for example. I am curious if there are morphological or syntactic differences between PNWE and General American. Specifically, I'm looking for peer-reviewed research describing any, but I'm finding it hard to find articles on PNE that aren't about phonology or are attitude surveys. 

I finally found some information along the lines of what I'm looking for in "A corpus-based regional dialect survey of grammatical variation in written Standard American English," Jack Grieve's PhD dissertation. Grieve used spatial autocorrelation over text corpora from 200 American cities to identify dialectical features. For all findings below, other regions either showed no preference or a preference in the opposite direction. Here is a summary of some of his findings relevant to the Northwest: 

Second reason: In imperative clauses, the versions that have an overt 2nd person subject ("you") would have the same meaning as those that have no subject and those that use a vocative. For instance: 

This example is basically the same as your example #1, except that this example is using synthetic negation instead of analytic negation. Let's see how the three alternate versions ("you" as overt subject vs no subject vs vocative) look: 

NOTE: CGEL is the 2002 reference grammar by Huddleston and Pullum et al., The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. 

Version #4.a seems to be completely unacceptable; and version #4.c seems weird--though, its subordinate clause does sound like it is an imperative clause. And so, the three subordinate clauses don't seem to be interchangeable here. This is the same conclusion we had when we performed this test with example #1a-c. The main difference between example #4 and your original example #1 is that example #4 seems to sound smoother (to me). 

The following features were found to cluster in the PNW, but were not globally autocorrelated across the country: 

We started learning about argument structure in my syntax class, and I am confused by implicit arguments, which our book hardly touches on. What is the argument for a verb having an implicit argument vs. being a member of a different subcategory that has fewer arguments? The distinction here seems arbitrary, or at least based on semantics, not syntax. Specifically under discussion is using give with only two arguments, when give is the prototypical trivalent verb. 

Years ago, I heard of a website that allowed you to search thousands of described languages by feature, like consonant inventory and word order. It was an acronym, and I think it had multiple W's in it. What website am I thinking of? 

Your last two examples (#2, #3) are unremarkable, and are completely acceptable in today's standard English. It's that example #1 that is interesting, and I'm assuming that is the one that you are mainly interested in discussing. Here are my thoughts on what the subordinate clause in example #1 might be. Example #1's subordinate clause doesn't seem be an imperative clause for several reasons. (Though, the sentence does seem to be intended by the speaker to be a mandative construction.) First reason: The analytic "do not" is of somewhat doubtful acceptability in (main clause) imperatives that have "you" as overt subject, e.g. "You do not be so cheeky". (Info borrowed from CGEL page 928-9.) CGEL says on page 802-3 that: 

Those above three examples are basically interchangeable, especially as to their meaning; and also, I would expect all three versions to have the same level of acceptability. But in example #1, its subordinate clause doesn't seem to have the same acceptability (nor, perhaps, even the same meaning) for the corresponding alternates: 

Both of these sentences presuppose the playing, i.e. Alex was definitely playing the piano, regardless of whether he did or did not stop. While the absence/presence of the negation reverses the truth value of the proposition expressed by the predicate 'stop', it has no impact on the truth value of the proposition expressed by the predicate 'play'. To sum up so far, presupposition is closely associated with the predicates that are expressed in sentences. Primary predicates in sentences do not carry presupposition, whereas secondary predicates can carry presupposition. Interestingly, however, the nature of the primary predicate can impact the ability of a secondary predicate to bear presupposition. Consider the predicate 'say' in this regard: 

My exposure to the notions of thematic roles (or semantical roles) suggests that the particular inventory of roles posited varies quite a bit from one author to the next. The roles that seem to be most accepted are agent, patient, experiencer, and theme. But even these terms are applied variably depending on the grammarian. The roles that are defined most clearly are agent and experiencer. An agent is a sentient being that acts with volition. An experiencer is sentient being that experiences an occurrence, action, or event. Both of these roles can influence actual syntax in concrete ways. Both can establish point of view and thus influence the distribution of, for instance, certain pronouns, e.g. the -self forms. The role patient is not as clear for me, since I've seen it used in different ways. The question is whether or not a patient should be construed as a sentient being. The role that might be missing from the list in the question is theme. The theme role seems to be used in a somewhat vague sense when the subject (or object) is not sentient. In this regard, one might classify the man in The man falls as a theme, since a nonsentient entity can also fall, e.g. The glass fell, The leaves are falling, etc. Further, one can classify the copula as an intransitive verb. When the copula combines with a predicative adjective or predicative noun, the theme role seems to be preferred, e.g. The rain is a drizzle, The room is dark. 

I assume the implicit arguments are something like "to the blood bank" and "things." Note that this isn't my exact homework question, but an underlying one I'm asking to understand my actual question. 

As a native speaker of English, it is almost immediately obvious to me when a speaker is Native American or Black. I find the difference is most obvious in men, I find, but even setting aside dialectical differences, I could easily tell apart a Black woman and a White woman. In North America, these races are often English L1 speakers, and in my part of the country, there isn't a huge Black population like in Chicago or the South, for example that would allow sociolects to describe the change. Are there described anatomic differences between racial groups? 

Is there a word for a "language community," especially a minority language embedded with in a larger one? For example, speakers of Catalán, Irish Gaelic, or perhaps immigrant groups that form communities such as Little Italy or Chinatown? My mind always reaches for "sprachbund," but that's not correct.
