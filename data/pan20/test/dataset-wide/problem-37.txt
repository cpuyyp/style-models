Constraint #2: Ye cannae change the laws of physics. Also, magic can't change the climate. The After Oil series editor, John Michael Greer, proprietor of The Archdruid Report, put out his call for submissions in contest form. Here's the official statement of the contest rules: 

There. A powerful, beautiful creative concept. Just so we're clear. :-) Now, to, you know, actually answer the question you're asking... 

I realize it's not too realistic, but I'd ideally also like a model which can handle such difficult topics as: 

Cool question, and potentially a pretty cool world. :-) A few responses to your proposed planet and civilization, working towards questions of transportation: Planetology of a forest world There's a bit of a problem in your initial description of the planet: 

Greer's insightful treatment of empires as complex systems gives us a pretty good grounding in what's going on. Essentially, empires exist as parasites on external sources of wealth. As parasites, they never manage to avoid the exhaustion and destruction of those sources of wealth. Meanwhile, the empire has generated costly internal complexities in order to administer the imperial economy and society, and has also become dependent on unequal systems of economic exchange that enforce the empire's advantages. This in turn requires big military expenditures. Systems theory assures us that these layerings of complexity on complexity yield diminishing returns, so the whole edifice becomes increasingly fragile... Why do empires fall? Fundamentally, for two reasons: exhaustion of indispensable resources, and the inherent structural progress towards diminishing returns on internal investment. Please note that I'm not dismissing the other answers. All of them are at least partially true, I think. But I agree with Greer: the fundamental nature of an empire is the root of its own demise. By the way: Greer's work in general is an excellent resource for worldbuilding. You may find it offputting, because he's a clergyman (he really is an Archdruid) or because he believes that our civilization is entering into a long period of descent; but his insights in military history, human ecology, systems theory, and reality-based economics are all very solid; and they amount to considerably more than the sum of the parts. 

If you're willing to use a bit of artistic license: Pick an important-but-obscure chemical like Germanium or Gallium. Say the entire supply was destroyed - maybe it only occurs in one place, and rogue states destroyed it? Or take some historical industrial health problem like ethylene glycol ethers, fictionalise a Chernobyl scale accident, and claim the safe alternatives just couldn't perform as well. 

The truth is in reality we could have an all-robot war tomorrow - ICBMs and cruise missiles fit almost every definition of a robot. Of course, although in such a war it would be robots carrying all the weapons, huge numbers of humans would die as well as the robots being destroyed. In the book "Arms and Influence", Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling advances the view that there are two things a military can do to accomplish a country's goals in a conflict: 

Needless to say, coercion is a lot less heroic, and politicians are much less likely to advocate for it in clear, open language. But the truth is in many situations it's easier, cheaper and more effective. I can make direct force difficult by having my missile factories hidden and fortified - or maybe instead of launching missiles I'm doing something harder to police, like funding rebel groups within your country. Given humans' natural appetite for revenge, some would argue that every war that ends without annihilation or permanent occupation has had an element of coercion. Anyway, here's my point: Coercion requires pain or the threat thereof, and a drone-vs-drone battle doesn't have any pain (except the opportunity cost of that-drone-cost-money-that-could-have-been-spent-elsewhere) - so both sides will be looking to get around the other side's drones, so they can land attacks that actually hurt the other guy. So even if both sides have 100% drone militaries, it's drone-vs-civilian strikes that are actually going to bring the war to a conclusion. 

@Wick, I suspect many, if not most, of your concerns with respect to the theory and practice of teleportation are addressed in Larry Niven's essay EXERCISE IN SPECULATION: THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TELEPORTATION. The essay is adapted from a talk Niven gave at Boskone, the New England Science Fiction Association conference which is reliably packed with MIT students. So Niven knew he couldn't get away with non-rigorous handwaving, and had to look fairly carefully at the various scenarios. Since he has a good working knowledge of physics and has read a lot of science fiction, there's a lot of good solid speculative science in it. Among other things, Niven goes into a good amount of detail about the kinds of issues @JonOfAllTrades raises: conservation of momentum and energy. My own favorite zany speculation is the design for the "end-teleport drive", a spaceship that teleports itself onto its own front end. That's just glorious. 

All in all, I'm starting to have serious concerns about the feasibility of your idea. I think that the fundamental creative vision is (as mentioned above) pretty wonderful. However, strictly interpreted, your particular scenario - lots of very large ships rafted together - seems unworkable. There are some things you could do to fix it from the standpoint of practical shipbuilding and seamanship, if you're willing to relax some of your requirements. For example: Raft dedicated components rather than big ships It's not at all hard to devise modular floating structures that would raft together nicely. Because they wouldn't have the initial design constraints as independently operable ships, they could be incredibly superior for rafting purposes. 

These factors tend to be self-correcting, or at any rate short-lived. However, in their heyday, they create surges of piratical activity that seem to erupt, and remain intractable, for a while until the conditions do in fact change. (See The Golden Age of Piracy.) However, there's another kind of piratical scenario that may be more useful for your purposes, because it's got more staying power: Asymmetrical warfare. A handy example is the modern-day situation of Somali piracy, in which the pirates began as fishermen whose livelihoods were reportedly wrecked by toxic waste dumping and illegal overfishing in their traditional fishing grounds. According to the article, the fishermen-turned-pirates have, over the last few years, mostly become criminal gangs rather than resistance fighters, and enforcement efforts have severely reduced the Somali pirates' activities. However, this is a somewhat different situation than the Golden Age piracy. 

I guess the first step would be to select a group of promising 15 years old kids and give them the best political education still available (most teachers and preceptors having probably been over 25) so in 3 years when the new King die they could assure a collective government for the next 5/6 years. At the society level, some adjustments will have to be made too. As raised in previous answers, socialism will be the only viable solution as you cannot really let uneducated kids take society changing decisions, or even expect them to make the right choices to ensure their own survival. Also the traditional family unit would no longer function. Raising of kids would have to be assured by government facilities where 12-25 years old would take care of 0-12 kids. We can assume all kids can have a basic education up to 10-12 yo (when they are old enough to work in farms); then a selection should be made to find those who could get 4-5 years extra education and take strategic jobs (teaching/ruling/medical), while others will start working to feed the kingdom. That would let the educated class about 5/6 years of adult life, which should be enough for assuring stability in a government (most countries have 4 or 5 years terms for political functions). Of course, things like scientific research or medicine would lose a lot but this is a medieval society so I guess it won't be such a change), but in the other hand since politicians won't have any chance to be elected for a second term they may actually take sensible decisions. Bottom line: There is no "fix'em all" solution, but damage control can help until a real solution is found. 

All right, by the terms stated in Serban's question (which I like a lot), there's no better answer than Michael Kj√∂rling's Peak Oil scenario. Bobson noted, "We can see this coming and we still aren't managing to change it." In other words, it's not just a hypothetical - it's something that we are actually doing to ourselves and to the planet, now. If you look at serious studies of societal and civilizational collapse in history, such as the works of Joseph Tainter and Jared Diamond, it becomes achingly obvious that we're not a different species than the Romans, or the Mayans, or the Easter Islanders, or the Anasazi, or the Achean Greeks, or the Greenland Norse, or... well. Michael has answered the question, as posed, authoritatively. Nonetheless, I'm going to throw another answer out there. I'm going with a pandemic. Not an exotic one - a new strain of SARS, say. Not genetically engineered, not introduced by aliens or military research labs. Just a bad strain of comparatively natural virus. It's not even particularly bad compared to some of the doom plagues already suggested. It kills several million people worldwide, but on a planet of 7 billion that's not much more than a rounding error. Captain Trips it ain't. (I'm not being callous here - the immensity of that number, seven billion, is important to this narrative.) No, the reason our BADASSARS is so destructive is that it mutates pretty quickly, so vaccinations and survivor immunity don't provide much protection. It also has a long latency in the human organism and is exceptionally contagious via many vectors, including the dreaded airborne vector. (It gets through filters pretty readily too.) In short, the only way to stay safe is to stay the hell away from, well, everybody. As a kicker, let's postulate that the terminal symptoms are insanely hideous, like a Krokodil addict with Ebola. The risk of contracting the disease is intolerable, even if intellectually you know your odds of survival are good. In other words, it's pretty carefully crafted to disrupt human contact and society. (I know this because, well, I designed it that way for your reading pleasure.) And here's where that seven billion number comes in. BADASSARS only directly kills several million people, as mentioned. But indirectly it kills hundreds of times times as many. We are seven billion people on a planet that, without modern agricultural technology and transportation/distribution networks, could feed maybe one billion. When the people of the world begin to understand the implications of BADASSARS, the networks unravel. Technological agriculture grinds to a halt. Oilfield workers won't even come to their jobs anymore. Nobody can risk going to stores. Ships won't sail. Soldiers and cops desert. Nobody tends the electrical generating stations (which are running out of fuel anyway.) Why? because people are terrified of each other, because everyone is a monster in each other's eyes. They shoot each other but are afraid to loot the bodies. Civil order is lost. Doomed citizens, in their hundreds of millions, flee the cities, because (to coin a phrase) Hell is other people. After a few years, BADASSARS subsides. It has mutated out of its virulent phase. Still, the world we know - the world of medicine and cars, of electric power distribution networks, of hot clean water for washing up and cold clean water for drinking, of enough food that won't make you sick, of shoes you can afford, of music you don't have to play yourself (and let's face it, you suck at trying to pick out that Richard Thompson song on that guitar you can't tune), of a safe home and a safe community - lies in ruins. It's an unprecedented loss of human life, and the survivors, except for a few sociopaths - oh goody - are likely to be traumatized. Hey, did somebody order a Dark Age?
