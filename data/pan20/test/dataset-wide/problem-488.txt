I've not seen a cassette that doesn't do this, IMO they all do it to some degree as the cassettes floats on its bearings unless the pawls are engaged. Some say it's by design perhaps to aid with gear changes etc. I used to have £2000 road bike with custom built wheels that used to do the same thing, it never caused any trouble even after many thousands of miles riding. Unless it's causing specific issues I wouldn't worry about it. 

It certainly doesn't look healthy to me. I'd recommend getting that check out professionally by someone with experienced in carbon frame repair. Better that than it snap later on you. 

Ah sorry.. I didn't realise the image was of the inner fork leg. The only permanent option here apart from a new part is to remove the inner fork leg and take it to an engineering workshop.. A good shop should be able to grind the leg down in the damaged area. Then either fill it and machine it back to size, or spray weld it which is a different process to fill the damaged area, then again machine it back to original diameter. Filling by welding can be done with most materials in one way or another. 

As long as the unit is not fully sealed and the port is accessible then yes, the port can be changed. Changing the port is not a job just anybody can do, as in a lot of cases these days just like with mobile phone repairs experience in micro-soldering may be required especially where the ports contacts are soldered to the PCB. Hot air stations are normally used on this sort of job as the port is usually soldered to a PCB ground plane which makes removal with an iron alone virtually impossible. A mobile phone repair specialist will likely be able to replace the port for you. 

Sounds like the valve has stuck shut, this can happen if the rubber seal at the base of the valve swells up. If the valve core is replaceable just get the appropriate valve tool and a replacement core, both are really cheap. Otherwise its likely to require a replacement tube. 

Frame materials can severely effect the handling of a bike.. Even different steel materials can. For example when you steer quickly on a bike, that steering force is transmitted through the frame which then acts like a spring and you can feel it. Softer materials will 'give' making for a slower steering response. Not only that but a lot of pedaling force can be lost/absorbed by a flexing frame. Materials like aluminium and carbon are far stiffer and this can be felt both in quicker & sharper steering and also when sprinting on the bike. The frame will flex much less which transmits more power though the drive train to the rear wheel, as opposed to that potential effort and energy being absorbed & lost through a springy frame material. 

I would say that you've either got air in the lines or perhaps moisture in the brake fluid. Assuming that mechanically the brakes are good. I would completely drain the brake fluid and replace it with the manufacturers spec fluid and bleed it properly. 

Its possible that you have oval bearings in the freewheel or even a cracked pawl, even though you say the bike is new this does happen. Take the bike back to where ever you purchased it an ask them to replace it as faulty. In the second video I also think the chain is making the noise but this maybe wrong as I'm hearing the sound wrongly. Turn the bike upside down though and pedal backwards slowly. Watch the chain links as they travel over the freewheel as you may notice that there are tight links here, they will show up as they lift when they travel over the freewheel. If you find any loosen them up with a chain link tool. 

I'd go with aluminium... But just a note of caution.... IF you do decide on carbon, steer clear of cheap versions. There are many many places selling cheapo carbon bars etc that are fake! The likes of FSA etc are now having to insert multiple hologram and ultra violet features into their bars, seatposts, stems etc as there are so many fakes being reported. There was recently a BBC report on this growing problem... $URL$ 

You can use almost anything you like as chain lube on a bike as anything is better than a dry squeaky chain. However for chain longevity, lasting lubrication and lack of oil flinging.. Specific stuff is in most cases better. When I used to motorcycle and motoX I ended up using a chain lube called PJ1 Blue Label, it was awesome stuff especially as when used on my immaculate road bikes the lube wouldn't fly off and coat my rear wheel in grease. It goes on from the straw like bubbling thin oil and is quite tacky, then it thickens up. I always wiped off the excess whilst it was still thin. It was soo good I transferred its use over to my pedal bikes too and it worked like a charm. 

Tyres will always loose pressure over time, I would say that for cycle tyres 1-2 psi is closer to the norm for most including me. This is mainly due to the microscopic pores in the tyre/tube which air molecules escape through over time. However don't forget that the air in tyres also expands and contracts with temperature, so on colder days tyre pressures will decrease slightly, and vice-versa on warmer days pressures will increase, it is considered that roughly 1-2 psi with every 10 degree increase/decrease in temperature is the norm here. Natural deflation also occurs more rapidly the higher the pressure so as you reach a tyres max pressure it will deflate quicker, and thus to keep your tyres at max pressure you'll need to inflate them every couple of days due to the higher pressure loss rate. 

I'm just going to assume here that as you say your freewheel is ok,.. that it doesn't have worn pawls etc. Turn your bike upside down and pedal it slowly in reverse (not driving the rear wheel) whilst your doing this look and listen closely as the chain travels over the freewheel. You are looking for any tight links in the chain here which can cause the issue you describe. If you find any tight links.. use a chain link tool to adjust the relevant tight pins.. This will free up the tight spot. 

You are already riding considerately by the sounds of it which is great.. I can only advise though on what I used to do. The Highway Code is somewhat vague regarding exact rule for cyclists.. However you ARE entitled to be on the road and drivers ARE obliged to give you plenty of room when overtaking you. As a racing cyclist (a few years ago now) I would always ride about 2 feet away from the curb, especially on roads that were wide enough for it not to be a problem. This would allow me to clear the drain covers and any recesses they were in, whilst also avoiding the stones & debris which is often laying at the roadside.. I don't think in all my years of road training that I ever had a real problem with drivers.. Well apart from the selfish few that believed that I should just not exist on their road.. But you'll always get those ☺️ Personally I wouldn't advise riding towards the middle of lanes as I know of folk who've been hit directly from behind doing this, as they've just not been seen at all.. as hard as that is to believe. IMO I'd rather be passed closely than hit directly from behind. This has even happened to my brother as he was stopped at traffic lights on a large motorbike. On your dual carriageway if there is no cycle track/lane just be careful and aware.. Ride about 2 feet from the curb, wear bright clothing and use a red strobing rear LED light, even in the daytime! Also as the roads are so busy and damaged these days a small camera may be worth considering. Not only would it be helpful in the event of an accident, but it will also assist with any claims to the council for damage to your wheels & tyres etc travelling on todays broken roads.. I have been refunded on a couple of occasions after providing pictures to the council of damage to my wheels and tyres due to hitting large water filled pot holes in the wet. Take care and ride safe 

With 1.5+ inches of play in the wheel.. as others have mentioned it sounds like the hub bearings have collapsed. It also sounds as though the damage will be way beyond just replacing bearings, because with so much play its likely that a new hub will be required too. 

If you just want to hide the chip a little just touch it a couple of times with a black sharpie pen. If that's not good enough, get a suitable vehicle touch-up colour & the lacquer, and do it properly. 

It could be the freewheel or hub bearing causing the squeak but this should not be the case as both are lubed, or should be. More likely is as you mention a spoke. Sometimes spokes squeak at the hub end as they flex.. Try rubbing in some grease or putting on a drop of oil on each spoke fitting at the hub end to see if it cures it, just ride the bike and let the lube take effect. Of course a spoke could also squeak at the nipple end too as it flexes slightly in the wheel, the only way to address/lube this end properly is by removing the tyre etc and applying a tiny drop of oil to each nipple. Don't let it get near your braking surfaces though.
