This addresses the perfect solution for silnylon. $URL$ Or if you are wanting to continue with instruction that specifically discuss PU coatings there is this: $URL$ The processes are identical, one just cites one specific kind of material while the other offers a more general application base. In case of page deletions here is a brief summary of the information: Shelters made out of cuben fabric never need re-coating. All other fabrics do have a coating which will degrade over their lifespan, mainly due to rubbing, the degrading effect of UV light from the sun and storing it wet. Shelter fabrics usually have either one of those two coatings: a silicone coating or a PU-coating (polyurethane). Tent floors usually have a PU-coating while tent flysheets usually have a silicone coating. However, a PU-coating is still used by some manufacturers on their tent flysheets. It is important to know which kind of coating has been applied to your shelter as each of these two kind of coatings need another product and solvent for re-coating. Some tents like for example those of MSR even have a different coating on each side of the fabric of the tent fly, a silicone coating on the outside and a PU-coating along the inside. If you’re not sure about the type of coating, try to contact the manufacturer.Coatings based on silicone are the easiest to renew. In case of a PU-coating it is more difficult to find the right product and solvent. Ok, what do you need? These are the necessary items for a silicone coating: White spirit A tube of silicone: transparent and odorless (without additives) A silicone syringe A clean pot or jar An accurate weighing scale (one gram accuracy recommended) A paint brush A pair of protective gloves (you’ll notice I didn’t wear gloves but you should know better) For a PU-coating you’ll need an urethane based product and an appropriate solvent. One can also try the expensive option like Tent Sure Tent floor sealant from Mcnett or the Nikwax variant. Otherwise the method for a PU-coating will be rather similar as I’m going to explain for a silicone coating. 1.Pitch the tent in a well ventilated area, preferable outdoors(on a sunny day). If weather conditions cause a good bit of dust and debris to carry in the air wait, or move indoors. While minimal dust will not affect the quality of your application large particles (like the neighbor mowing) will affect adhesion. 2.Clean to prepare fabric for coating. Make sure that fabric is completely dry before attempting to recoat. 3.Prepare mixture: Pour white spirits(15) and silicone(1) into a jar (weighing) the components so that there is a 15:1 ratio. As a general guideline try to using a 1.5g/1 sq. m estimate when purchasing materials. Consider each side of your tent/tarp an independent area if you are going to coat both sides. Stir until spirits and silicone are dissolved. 4.Paint mixture onto fabric ensuring that no runs or drops gather on the fabric. Once dried touch the surface to determine if coating is thick enough. IF necessary apply another coat. Some minor discoloration may be noticed due to operator errors. (Who can perfectly and evenly paint that kind of surface?) 5.After you are confident the tent is 100% dry test the coating with a spritz of water. If the water beads and runs off you have succeeded. If not repeat steps 1-5 again. 

Disclaimer: I am from Romania, my answer is a bit tailored to this corner of the world. This issue is very common in Central/Eastern European countries and in the Balkans: not only the household dogs in villages, but stray ones (even in cities), and especially the shepherd dogs. Might be a bit repeating the other answers, but I really must point this out, as it has been the source of many accidents, attacks and (yet unsolved) disputes on law inforcements. Shepherd dogs are bread to be aggressive: whether assertive barking when turning the hundreds of sheep, giving alarm of an intruder or scaring away bears. The herds can be met literally anywhere (I met them near my hometown, or also at 2200 m altitude in the mountains), and if you approach them they most probably become aggressive. Methods of staying safe: 

When I hike alone, I tend to stop very often, just to take photos or pick some herbs. Hiking with other people motivates me to go on. Of course, the slowest person dictates the pace of the group, and that is often me. What proved to be a good practice when I am with a bigger group is to split in two: those who want to go faster are not bored because of the slow ones, and the slow people don't get tired too fast because of the unsuitable pace. We agree on a mid-point where the fast guys wait for the slower ones (have lunch there or something), and then we meet at the day's destination. The tendency I noticed is that the slow group is usually delayed with 20-30 minutes, but of course this can vary on people and terrain. 

Before leaving home: I prepare myself two safety kits (see this one as an idea) - one contains medication and first aid, the other has survival tools (like matches and stuff to build a fire). I check their content periodically, so when I leave to a trip I just throw the boxes in my bag and know I have all I need. The rest of the things: I try to run a scenario of a day. I need water and food - do I have a bottle? snacks?; I arrive in the evening - I need tools for cooking; I have to set camp - do I have all I need for sleeping? 

Try starting a discussion on the couchsurfing page of the given Swedish region saying that you would like to do this or that type of trekking, for given period and difficulty, preferably include what gear would be needed; this way locals and nearby travelers may contact and join you, but beware: there is no warranty that the potential trekking partners would match your experience or expectations. Also, check out the local scout troops: if they have the rover/adult age category, you would most probably find people interested in trekking. 

I prepare my toothpaste using this recipe, main ingredients here being baking soda and coconut oil. Positive parts: it works just as well as "classical" toothpaste, it is safer to swallow, ingredients are natural. Negative parts: it has a more fluid consistence, needs a somewhat heavier container to carry it around. 

A couple of factors from my own experience are: Pronation - I over-pronate slightly, so the outside of my heel gets worn down more quickly than the inside. When it wears past a certain point, I find myself rolling my ankle more than usual and end up buying new boots. Sole material - The softness of the sole material has a large impact on the longevity. Soft "comfort" soles of course wear out a lot faster than harder soles. This of course is why running shoes wear out quickly. Of course, the downside is that harder soles can be a little less comfortable, but that's something you'll need to weigh up for yourself. I'd agree that 300 miles (30 decent walks) are on the low end of what you'd expect. I'd advise you to take a good look over your worn-out boots and identify where they've worn out the most, then buy something that addresses those points. Or take an old pair into a reputable store and ask for guidance. 

This sounds like a macabre version of one of those teambuilding exercises. As noted above, your emotions will be going haywire and you won't think clearly. You'll probably stay with your fallen friend for some time before you get your thoughts in order. 

I use a very nice pair of 15x50 image stabilised binoculars for birding/wildlife. Yes, they're pretty heavy but when I can stand next to a birder with a dedicated spotting scope and see things that he can't, I'm pretty happy with myself. It's also pretty good for aviation and for casual star-gazing. The image stabilisation doesn't seem to affect image quality in any significant way. Heavy and expensive though. 

If your friend is undoubtedly dead, then your own safety becomes paramount. If you can't safely get to the body, then you can only leave it in situ until you get the authorities there (by whatever means). In the unlikely event the body is in the open and readily to hand, then practically speaking, protecting the dignity of your friend (and family) is most important. If you have no means of contacting the authorities from where you are and have to travel some distance to gain help/communication: 

Pine Martens aren't native to the Lake District as yet - you need to go further north to find them (and then in small numbers). This will most likely be one the more common mustelids - Stoats will happily (and greedily) take rabbits, which I believe are your bones. Without a photo/dimensions of the scat, I have to offer the most likely answer here. And yes, the Stoat looks small compared with the Rabbit, but it's fully capable of dragging it's prize many metres to a feeding spot. 

Because roads are harder than hooves, and whatever is harder usually wears down whatever is softer. It's also pretty good protection against chipping/splitting that the horse may get from stepping on rocks. 

At the risk of suggesting the obvious here: 1) Rig up an internal hoop. Use a spare of one of the external hoops and cut a few inches off to fit. Pad the ends, and Velcro the ends and top to the inside of the tent. 2) Put a few more guy-ropes on the end hoops to encourage some more lateral tension. Second option should be the easiest one to try. 

Once it happened that we were camping in the middle of a pine tree forest: weather was clear, no wind... After waking up we found a 20 meter long pine tree fallen down right between two tents. We had sheer luck for the tree falling in the "right" angle + being slowed down by the other trees around it. 

I keep encountering this issue during summer, when wearing short trousers or a skirt while hiking: my boots get filled up with small rocks and stones, and I must stop from time to time to empty them. I guess this is a common issue, but I was wondering: is there some method to avoid, or at least lessen the little stones which get in my shoes? What I have tried so far: 

If it is a more polluted area, try the method suggested by WedaPashi (cleanup activity with friends), or take a look at Let's Do It - a worldwide trash-collecting/volunteering action; find your country and contact the local organization. This also puts the issue in an other light (and on the world map), and it might get bigger media attention too, spread the awareness etc. 

There are a lot of games out there ("team building" games, introductory ones, icebreakers etc.). This is just the first result of a google search. All games can be adapted to the size and age of the group, but using such games needs preparation in advance. Some people find such games a nuisance, others tend to enjoy them a lot - it really varies. A lot of (youth) organizations have game databases with all kind of searching parameters (size, age, purpose, environment etc.), for example there is this one for small children. I know others, but not in English, so... :( Besides the aforementioned common chores and "doing something hard" together I would mention introducing some sort of ritual. It can be as short as a few minutes, but it should include everyone in the team. Some examples: 

Out of some wonder, the peanut butter in our area comes in plastic jars, meaning that it is lighter than a normal jar. I save these plastic jars during the year and use them later on hikes. Also, in the local grocery stores I can buy some dairy products which come in plastic buckets and boxes (like this one, this or this) - I save these for trips and hikes: they can be easily packed into each other, or I can fill them with other objects (berries I pick from the forest, socks or anything else) after they get empty. They also hold liquids quite well, although I use a plastic bag to be sure there would be no leaking. Also, in case they become redundant I am not so sorry to dispose them as if I would be for a tupperware box. 

It might sound a bit odd and not-so-related to the question, but have you considered carrying a Kindle? I got used to carry mine along, wherever I go (bagpacking included). Advantages
