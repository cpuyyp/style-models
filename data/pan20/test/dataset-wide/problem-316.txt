There are a number of different assumptions that need to be made before we can answer the question of what is the most powerful weapon that could be effectively used without rendering a planet inhabitable. First, we need to assume we are using a 'clean' sci-fi method of destruction - we don't need to worry about high levels of radiation from the fallout that results from a detonation. This may be moot as modern thermonuclear weapons tend to become cleaner as their yield increases but I'm not sure just how that would scale. Second, we need to assume we're talking about some form of an explosive weapon. Chemical weapons, biological weapons, etc are out of the scope of the discussion. This would be a nuke, anti-matter bomb, ultra-high velocity kinetic weapon, or something similar. Third, we're talking about a single weapon rather than the deployment of a number of smaller individual weapons. There are a number of reasons to use many smaller weapons in this case - it's a fine line to walk between destroying everything but still leaving at least a good portion of it habitable. The destruction of an explosive weapon doesn't scale linearly with yield due to the inverse square law, and because planets are spherical no matter where you detonate the weapon half of it will be in shadow. Most of the explosive force of an incredibly large bomb will radiate into space as well. That said, I would imagine a weapon in the range of ten gigatons (200 Tsar Bombas) would be destructive enough to devastate all but hardened shelters across a planet the size of earth. Between the fireball itself and the radiation / thermal pulse, most everything that had line of sight to the explosion would be completely annihilated. The rest of the planet would fare better, but the thermal and sonic effects - along with the weather systems that would probably result - would be pretty devastating as well. Still, once things settled down after a few days, the area outside the immediate vicinity of the detonation should be livable again. 

In all likelihood, had the German submarine fleet been significantly larger and the allies suffered more significant losses, it would have spurred faster development and production of Liberty ships and counter-submarine tactics. Even if the fleet had doubled in size, the tactics it was using would still have proven insufficient to fully blockade Britain. The allies would have used more Q-ships and armed the Liberty / Victory ships with more anti-submarine weaponry. Losses would have been higher, but they still would have been acceptable (as there was simply no other option). The largest impact would probably have been the reallocation of B-17 and B-24 bombers for maritime anti-submarine patrols. There would probably also be reallocation and elevated production of destroyers and other anti-submarine ships. This may have diminished the ability for the Allies to strike at mainland Europe and lengthened the war by a few months, but overall the German submarine fleet would have needed to be many times larger to truly turn the tide of war. 

One option would be sabotage of the aircraft's hydraulic systems. This is a fairly simple and straightforward form of sabotage, and could easily be missed until partway into the flight when the control surfaces become unresponsive. Although a large cut in the hydraulic system would probably be noticed by the pilot immediately, a smaller cut / leak or the weakening of a line that pops off later under load might not be noticed until mid-flight. Once the control surfaces become unresponsive, the alien would need to use telekinesis to manipulate the control surfaces and safely land the aircraft. Another option would be sabotage preventing the landing gear from descending and locking properly. In this case, the alien would need to manipulate the landing gear or use their telekinesis to hold it in place until the plane has safely landed. In the latter case, the alien having to 'hold' the landing gear in place throughout the landing could hold some dramatic tension as the effort could be arbitrarily large or small, depending on the degree of sabotage. Additionally, the alien's telekinesis could fail midway through landing, but the crash could be minor enough for the passengers to survive. Other failures could be a fire in an engine where the fire extinguishers have been sabotaged. Or you could go all the way and have a missile / missiles fired at the aircraft, which your alien needs to manipulate enough that they just miss. 

As a baseline for how long a besieged city can survive being essentially cut off from the world, I would point you to the Siege of Leningrad. At the end of a three year siege with very limited resupply, the population of the city diminished from a pre-war population of ~3 million to approximately 700,000 - with roughly half that number being soldiers who came to help Leningrad. Another baseline would be the ongoing Battle of Aleppo, which has been going on for approximately three years. At this point, the rebels and government forces control their own areas, and barring outside intervention will likely remain in an extended stalemate. 

As an initial premise, a 70% effective tax rate is not particularly unreasonable. From 1936 through 1983, the effective tax rate was at (or significantly higher - approaching 90% at times) 70% for the highest incomes. If service were sufficiently dangerous or burdensome, this tax rate would likely be acceptable for many of the richest compared to the risk of injury or death. With a minimum service period of two years, and no constraints on when an individual could enlist, the richest would likely postpone joining the military until periods of peace, and enjoy the benefits for the rest of their lives. If possible, individuals would likely enlist and serve when they are young and have low earning potential in the least dangerous and least difficult positions possible. In all likelihood, this system would be established as a part of, or simultaneous with, the individual's higher education. If not, there would be a marginal benefit to employment figures as military service would likely serve as a massive 'jobs' program that keeps people out of the non-military workforce. Overall, however, if you could receive the maximum benefit possible by serving five years in a safe peacetime role, I think most people would choose to serve to reduce their future tax burden. Many countries already require some sort of compulsory service for 2-4 years without massive changes in their society, so I doubt that there would be little impact across society beyond much lower tax revenue (which, notably, would greatly impact the ability of the government to support a military that consists of the majority of the 17-25 demographic). 

No, a Niven ring is inherently unstable regardless of the mass of the body in the center. Any perturbation that makes the gravitational body off center will cause a stronger gravitational attraction between the closer part of the ringworld and the body at the center. As the ring gets more off-center, the force on the close portion increases (while the far portion decreases) until the ring inevitably collides with the central body. On the other hand, rings (like the rings around Saturn) are not rigid. Each particle of rock or dust orbits independently of the others and will be subject to normal orbital dynamics. There is no instability because the rings are not rigid. Interestingly, a rigid Dyson sphere is gravitationally stable. This is because the gravitational force is in three dimensions rather than the (basically) two dimensions of a ring. I'd propose, if you're looking to make a stable ringworld-type object, going with a variation of a Dyson Swarm - something I'd like to call a 'Niven Swarm'. A series of habitats orbiting a planet / star independently. You could then connect them to one another via a flexible conduit, so each would be in an independent and stable orbit, but the occupants of the 'ringworld' could travel between segments. I believe this would give you a stable ringworld that doesn't require unobtanium or some other material with a unrealistic tensile strength. In fact, there isn't really anything that would prevent us from building this today with our level of technology beyond the massive amount of material needed in orbit, and each segment could be occupied and used before the full 'ringworld' was complete. On the other hand, if you have the technology to build a ringworld, you also have the technology to make adjustments and cancel out any perturbations.
