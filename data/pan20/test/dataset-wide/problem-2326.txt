None of these fluids can be made "safe" for consumption. Most of these liquids are oil based with these exceptionn: 

There is a little bit information out there (here), about falls of climbers heavier than normal which suggests (very roughly) almost a linear relationship between fall load (force) and body weight, assuming equal fall factor. Applying this in the reverse, a significantly lighter climber would apply a significantly smaller load. This says a UIAA fall is rated for a factor of 1.77. Children of 15 kg don't climb lead (I'd say). During top roping, forces are much less, so I'd say it is safe, if the rope passes visual inspection and "feels" otherwise "right" (e.g. no broken core). I'd apply a rough safety margin of about 1 order of magnitude, so I'd say it's okay for people of up to 30-35 kg when top roping, and not okay for someone heavier or when lead climbing. In the end you have to use your own judgement, and if there are any doubts, just take the safer alternative: use a fresh rope. Pieces of old rope are reusable as donations for e.g. childrens day cares. 

In my garage, and when it is parked around town, I lock my bike to a rack via a U-lock or at least a cable lock. How should I similarly secure my kayak? I realize that a determined thief can break most locks but let’s assume conventional bike locks are good enough to deter casual thieves. 

Most solutions require threading one or two long lockable cables through some sort of “holes” in the kayak and onto the fixed rack. The locking cables can be elongated versions of standard bicycle cable locks. However, you may require a “python” cable lock, which allows the working end to be thin and to be tightened through the lock. Kayaks can have a number of different things serving as “holes”: 

You did not say whether you were going downhill skiing or cross-country. The difference is significant: When downhill skiing you are being carried uphill each time between runs and so are not generating much of your own heat and so are not going to sweat much. You are also never very far from warm shelter where, if you feel cold, you can usually (a) consume hot food and drink and (b) blow hot air into your (temporarily empty) gloves and boots. Thus, so long as you have enough clothing to keep you warm, it needn't be "thermal". In fact, it is even safe to wear (the dreaded) cotton next to your skin. I do. When cross-country skiing -- or snow-shoeing or winter hiking -- you must propel yourself up every hill and doing so can generate much heat and cause sweating or giving off moist air. Because you are going to be relatively far from shelter, it is critical that you have "thermal" underwear and breathable outer shell that helps keep you warm and dry. Synthetics or merano wool will do. 

My personal preference is for gasoline (yes, even ethanol added). I've never had to clean any of my stoves since I started using it. Given that the quality is pretty closely monitored and regulated in the US this is an extremely consistent, clean burning, and cheap option. It's also extremely easy to find... It should be noted that the "white gas" available for purchase in lots of stores is pretty similar to low octane gasoline, but is priced at 17$ per gallon instead of 2.25$. In my experience it burns about the same (maybe just a tiny bit better), but any marginal advantage isn't worth the cost. Octane of the gasoline used doesn't seem to make any difference, nor does 10% ethanol. 

The right answer will depend vastly on how fast the trees grow. For example Aspen trees grow extremely fast in certain climates while subalpine fir are pretty slow growing in almost every case. Fortunately, there is an extremely easy way for you to find out the growth rate of your trees. Cut one down, count 10 years worth of rings and measure the distance between them. (As a mathematician I really can't support the math behind this, but it'll probably work.) Take the expected lifetime of your sign, divide by 10, and multiply by the distance you measured. This'll give you the distance the nail should stick out of the tree. Add a couple of inches so the nail won't fall out and you're golden. For example if your signs were going to be good for 50 years and the distance between the rings for the last 10 years was 1 inch you would need 5 inches of nail sticking out. (Note) I'm not sure this is the best way hang signs from trees, but it is the answer to the question asked. I'm pretty sure that dkippers answer is a better idea in practice. 

What material – such as polyester, polypropylene or wool – or combination thereof, both works to keep you warm when wet and dries quickly, as an alternative to neoprene? I'm looking for something cheaper and simpler than a dry suit but less restrictive than a wet suit, for paddling in cool but not very cold water. Something you can submerge in and still keep reasonably warm. 

A key part of your question -- "...in its stuff sack..." -- is not addressed here (or in the original, duplicate question). When I bought my first high-quality back-packing tent, I was advised not to store it stuffed into its sac for long periods. It seems perfectly logical to me to not store any "crushable" gear into its "carrying sac" for long periods for fear of having too many wrinkles and creases permanently imposed upon the material. I recently had an airbed, that was stored in its carry sac, annoyingly crack along such an unnatural stressed fold. Lucky for me it was a cheapo. I keep my more expensive air bed almost completely self-inflated. I keep my tents and sleeping bags in "storage sacs" that are each about double the size of their carrying sacs. That seems to be a good compromise between fully compressed and fully unwrapped; I don't have endless closet space. To effect a double-size sac for your tent and fly: get another carry-sized sac of similar size and store the tent and fly separately in the two separate sacs. Each will be reasonably compact and airy at the same time. Such a setup for my tent has lasted over 20 years so far. I went from this storage sac 

If the wear is indeed in the region which is mostly (only) in contact with the Click-Up, I'd double check the carabiner. Here the device is sold only together with its carabiner, to avoid mismatches which can cause increased wear, and reduce braking friction (so one part of the answer: in special cirumstances: yes it can). Is the carabiner original? Is is really without any edge? I enjoy the company of a few people while training, who use a diversity of belaying devices (each their favourite, each for considerable time). There is no apparent difference in wear (that is my answer) for tubes (e.g. ATC), Click-Up (which is also considered a tube-like device) or grigri. There is considerable increase in rope twist when belaying with a munter hitch. There is noticable wear around the region of redirection when top-roping on routes when the redirection point on the rope is around the same region for some time. All of those people are deliberately using the rope from both ends (to even out the unavoidable wear and twisting). Apart from wear through belaying and redirection I would also check whether the rope drags regularly over abrasive surfaces on the wall. 

I'm planning to go downhill skiing next week and I notice the forecast for the day in question is for winds of 50 to 60 km/h. That seemed high to me. A few years ago, at the same hill, we were turned away when they closed all chair lifts because of strong winds, but how strong I don't know. Are there any standard guidelines that ski hills follow regarding maximum allowable wind strengths, before they close the lifts? I've seen a couple of anecdotal claims that chair lifts remained open (on other hills) even in 40 mph (64 km/h) winds. Seems awfully high. 

There are some very crude outdoor compasses which tell us the direction of true north (and assume we can estimate angles from north). The following also assume we're in the northern hemisphere. A sun-stick-shadow compass: If the sun shines, place a vertical stick in the ground. Every 15 minutes or so, mark the end of the stick's shadow. The line of shadow marks will lie in a west-to-east direction. And if you happen to do this at mid-day, the very shortest shadow points south. A crescent moon compass: A morning moon looking like this "(" will have its bulge pointing east and an evening moon looking like this ")" will have its bulge pointing west. And the moon will be roughly in the south. More accurately, south is where a line joining the "horns" of the crescent extends down to and meets the horizon. The pole star compass: On a clear night the star called Polaris is virtually exactly pointing north. (Not part of the question but useful to know: the elevation angle of Polaris above the horizon is your latitude.) 

To answer your first question, it doesn't matter very much whether you put the prussik on the same strand as your dcd or on the free strand. One reason it might be considered safer is that putting the prussik on the other strand would allow the other rope to prussik to catch you if the line you were repelling on somehow failed. As this event is extremely unlikely the gain in safety is marginal. To answer the second question about double strand raps, it depends. If you'd like to pull your rap line (a common thing in climbing and canyoneering, very uncommon in caving) you wouldn't want to tie a knot in it. If you're planning on ascending the line later you probably would want to tie a knot in it. All this said, the common strategy caving is to fix a single line to the anchor. While in climbing the rope is usually doubled over so that it can be retrieved. The setup you've described isn't super common which is why the answer is a bit wishy-washy.
