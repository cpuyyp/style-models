▻ THE CATEGORIES - A MIXED AND ARBITRARY LIST ? The late Oxford philosopher, HA Prichard, referred to Aristotle's categories as 'an unrelated chaos in which it is impossible to acquiesce'. The categories and their apparent lack of an organisational principle also irked Bertrand Russell. The list of categories looks and might actually be unrefined and arbitrary. We can add that, except at 'Topics', I.9,103b22, Aristotle does not repeat the full list, nor does he make significant use of it elsewhere. But nor does he reject or revise it. ▻ PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND TO THE CATEGORIES Some background-setting is needed; and I'll try to do this briefly. In Aristotle's view reality is ultimately made up of individual things, individual physical entities, defined by their form. Each basic individual is an essence or substance (ousia)*. There are indefinitely many substances. But a substance cannot exist without properties or from a different angle things that are saying or predicabke if it. If I am a substance, I cannot exist without properties : I must be tall or short, bulky or slim, I must be somewhere and be there at a time, I must be older than X and younger than Y. As Aristotle summarises in 'Metaphysics', XIV.2.1089 b23, I must have states (pathe) and relations to other things (ta pros ti). This is the key to the categories. ▻ THE CATEGORIES The theory of categories is an attempt to list all the possible kinds of properties a substance can have. He lists ten, probably familiar but I'll repeat them just in case : substance (ousia), quantity (poson), quality (poion), relation (pros ti), where (pou), when (pote), position (keisthei), possession (echein), action (poiein), and undergoing or being acted on (paschein). Examples : substance (a human being), quantity (three miles), quality (blue), relation (half), place (Times Square), time (today), position (standing), possession (having an aptitude, knack, habit...), action (eating), being acted on (being fed). Aristotle takes these to be the mega-classes, if the phrase can be allowed, the highest or most general classes (genera) to which properties - all properties - belong and to which predicables pertain. ▻ PHILOSOPHY AND LANGUAGE There is nothing on the surface wrong with what Aristotle is trying to do here. The problem is that the list appears to, and probably does, lack an organising principle. Why these ten categories and not five or fifteen ? It is almost certain that grammatical considerations, features of language, played a major part in Aristotle's enumeration of categories. The German scholar, Friedrich Trendelenburg (1802-72), took the view that four of the categories (substance, quantity, quality, relation) derived from names and adjectives; another four (position, possession, action and being acted on) from verbs; and time and place from adverbs. (Friedrich Trendelenburg, Geschichte der Kategorienlehre, in Historische Beitrage zur Philosophie, v. I (Leipzig: Bethge, 1846. The 'a' in 'Beitrage' needs an umlaut which I can't type here.) In short, Aristotle appears to have worked inductively from these grammatical groups - names, adjectives, verbs and adverbs - to produce his kategoria or categories. REFERENCES J.

Marcuse sees a vital role remaining to aesthetics. It has not lost its revolutionary power, 'crippled by [philosophy's] resignation before reality'. 

A first-rate, intriguing question. I think we need to draw some distinctions, though. Are 'thoughts' mental images (as when one imagines someone in a sexual position), or propositions (as when one entertains a crude and unfair generalisation about a group, 'Xs are lazy and dishonest') or practical possibilities that present themselves ('The shop-keeper is not looking, I can pocket this tin of beans'). One can have any or all such thoughts in a 'bracketed' way, disconnected from intentional action altogether. (Gottfried Vosgerau and Matthis Synofzik, 'A Cognitive Theory of Thoughts', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 47, No. 3 (JULY 2010), pp. 205-222; W.J. Ginnane, 'Thoughts', Mind, New Series, Vol. 69, No. 275 (Jul., 1960), pp. 372-390.) ▻ INVOLUNTARY THOUGHTS Some thoughts in any of the senses I've listed can occur involuntarily. I cannot completely control the workings of my mind, which can throw up absurdities, fantasies, and (whether I like it or not) immoral thoughts such as the above. (Assuming for the sake of argument that they are immoral thoughts.) What I can't control, I can't be responsible for; and if I can't be responsible for these thoughts then they are not 'unethical'. Responsiblity has some connexion with choice; and in respect to these thoughts I had no choice about their occurrence. In a word, I am responsible for doing only what is in my power to refrain from doing; and it isn't in my power to refrain from involuntary thoughts. (G. P. Henderson, '"Ought" Implies "Can"', Philosophy, Vol. 41, No. 156 (Apr., 1966), pp. 101-112; Robert Merrihew Adams, 'Involuntary Sins', The Philosophical Review, Vol. 94, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 3-31; Robert C. Solomon, '"I can't get it out of my Mind": (Augustine's Problem)', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Mar., 1984), pp. 405-412.) ☛ Dreams Separate case : can I have unethical thoughts in a dream ? In what sense are the thoughts mine ? I should say, I can't have such thoughts in a dream since dream-thoughts just happen 'in me' : they are involuntary in a different sense from the kinds of involuntary thought considered so far. But I have no theory about what that different sense is. (William E. Mann, 'Dreams of Immorality', Philosophy, Vol. 58, No. 225 (Jul., 1983), pp. 378-385; Gareth B. Matthews, 'On Being Immoral in a Dream', Philosophy, Vol. 56, No. 215 (Jan., 1981), pp. 47-54.) ▻ VOLUNTARY THOUGHTS I think for a thought to be unethical, at least three conditions need to be met (adapted from Gareth B. Matthews, 50): (1) I have a thought which I recognise as a 'suggestion' to do something ethically wrong. (2) I have a positive attitude towards this suggestion; I like it, it gives me pleasure, or at any rate I see it as a live option. (3) I adopt it and include it in my practical reasoning, my decision about how to act. Roughly these conditions are defined in Here choice and responsibility are involved; and I should regard thought here as unethical. Even if the action fails, or if I think better of it and abandon it, at the time the thought occurred, the three conditions were met; and the thought was unethical. 

The only way I can think of, in which Idealists are not entitled to believe in Laws of Nature, is through the assumption that Laws of Nature apply in and to a world existing independently of the mind, while Idealists are limited to believing that only minds or mind-dependent ideas exist. If the Laws of Nature presuppose a world independent of the mind, to which they apply, and Idealists deny the existence of a mind-independent world, they cannot consistently believe in Laws of Nature. I am not expressing any view here about Idealism or Realism or about the existence or character of Laws of Nature. I am simply trying to reconstruct the thinking - or the possible thinking - behind the view that Idealists are not entitled to believe in Laws of Nature. 

Plato in the 'Republic' (VII, 532a-b, 534b-c) sees the best of all things - the Good - as existing separately in the Form of the Good (auto to agathon). The Form of the Good is a separate entity, transcendent of space and time; and everything else that is good to any degree is so by virtue of its 'imitation' of the Good. Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics 1.6; Eudemian Ethics 1.8) criticises the Platonic Form of the Good. There are many things that are good, he explains : a quantity can be good, a quality can be good, a place can be good, a position can be good, a relation can be good, a time can be good. But there is no credibility in holding that the goodness of a time has anything in common with the goodness of a place or of a quantity. There cannot be a common property of goodness which all these diverse things share. What makes a place good is one thing, what makes a time good is another. Aristotle differs from Plato in this way and, in what logically follows from this, in denying that the Platonic good exists at all. There is and could be no Form of the Good. But he does believe that 'the good, that is, the best' (to agathon kai to ariston' - 'Metaphysics', 12.10) is real. It does exist, only it is nothing like Plato's Form of the Good (even if that did exist). At 'Nicomachean Ethics', I.1, he says : If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief good. [tr. Ross] What we desire purely for its own sake is 'eudaimonia', happpiness or (better) well-being or human flourishing. Aristotle's view is that human beings have certain characteristic activities and that eudaimonia - our good - consists in exercising those activities as perfectly as possible. In doing so we fulfil our 'ergon' or function. Our ergon or function is a practical life informed by reason. This leads to the doctrine of the mean (we observe the mean when e.g. we act courageously and not on the one hand in a cowardly way or on the other foolhardily). Phronesis or practical wisdom yields knowledge of the (rational) mean in our actions. Reason is capable of various forms of theoretical and not merely practical development, however : scientific knowledge, intuitive understanding of first principles not least. One caveat is that Aristotle seems to be divided between a practical 'take' on the good - that it involves a practical life informed by reason - and a different, contemplative view developed or sketched in 'Nicomachean Ethics', X. Here contemplation (theoria) is projected as the ideal life. This is a crux in Aristotelian interpretation and can't properly be examined here. 

The point at issue is whether GM is irony. There are reasons for regarding Also Sprach Zarathustra as political irony (Daniel W. Conway, 'Solving the Problem of Socrates: Nietzsche's Zarathustra as Political Irony', Political Theory, Vol. 16, No. 2 (May, 1988), 257-280.) Why not GM as moral irony ? GM AS IRONY - FIRST ANGLE I can cite only an extract here but there is an extended case for an ironic reading of GM in Robert Guay, 'Genealogy and Irony' : 

Do you mean : Is all knowledge in the arts based on abductive inference ? Or only that some of it is ? Abductive inference is - what ? - something like this. B needs to be explained; if A were true then B would follow with a high degree of probability; therefore there is some reason to suppose that A is true. Three comments : 

'Not all knowledge is wisdom' ▻ WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE ARE CATEGORICALLY DIFFERENT By this I mean that, as I understand 'wisdom' and as I think it is generally understood, wisdom is a synthesis or combination of intelligence and sound judgement. There is no direct link with knowledge. I'd accept that sound judgement depends to some extent on knowledge; you can hardly make a sound judgement except accidentally about something of which you have no or only superficial knowledge. But this suggests a kind of causal dependence; knowledge is among the necessary conditions for sound judgement. But that doesn't make for a conceptual link between them. It doesn't make wisdom a variety of knowledge or knowledge a variety of wisdom. Knowledge and wisdom are different kinds of thing, hence my description of them as categorically different. ▻ KNOWLEDGE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR WISDOM If knowledge is causally necessary for sound judgement, which is a part of wisdom, it is certainly not sufficient. No matter how many justified, true beliefs one has about a subject, or however one defines propositional knowledge, no amount of such knowledge will of itself yield sound judgement. I may have world-class knowledge about the international banking and investment scene and yet have no reliable sense of what stock to buy or which pension scheme to invest in. ▻ WISDOM IS MORE VARIANT THAN KNOWLEDGE If I have medical degree or a master's in particle physics, I will be counted as knowledgeable about the relevant matters 'from China to Peru' (to purloin Dr Johnson's phrase). Wisdom by contrast is dependent, or more dependent, on social framework or context. What counts as, and is, sound judgement in political manoeuvring is not the same in Russia as in India or in India as in the USA. ▻ THE DUAL NATURE OF WISDOM Just as sound judgement is not identical with knowledge, though it causally depends on knowledge, so intelligence, the other component of wisdom, is not identical with knowledge. If I have an IQ of 120 or 140, does either figure tell you what or how much I know ? IQ tests aside, there are 'incredibly bright' people who not only do not have sound judgement but also do not know much either. Take an intensely intelligent slum-child in Victorian England : high intelligence, but no education, illiterate and with virtually no knowledge.
