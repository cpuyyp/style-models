I mean, they sound pretty devastating (and hilarious, depending on how you look at it). Maybe he just suffered from some linguistic disability (his boss e.g. certainly knew how to write nice letters), and was no real dummy otherwise (a JFK was also not in perfect health). But still, why did George H. W. Bush put him on the ticket in the first place? It seems as if he had not been an opponent in the primaries (with another wing of the party firmly behind him) and I don't remember Indiana being a battleground state at the time. So why the decision? 

Charles V (1500 – 1558) famously was ruler over an "empire on which the sun never set". It included large parts of Europe and also colonies in the new world. Charles V was born in the Low Countries and later ruled from Spain, which suggests a mainly North-to-South trajectory for his life in territories that stretched also across continents and from the distant West to the remote East. What were the westernmost and easternmost locations within the Empire that Charles V visited during his lifetime? (I take it that a visit to the colonies by such a ruler was never contemplated at that time.) 

In 155 BCE a delegation of three Greek philosophers arrived in Rome on a political mission (to negotiate the settlement of war fines). During their stay they succeeded in raising Greek philosophy to prominent attention and seeding its future important role in Rome. This is one summary (from SEP): 

I'd say it's the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE or Tokyo Trials) from 1946. Compare e.g. the wall pattern elements between your picture and this one (source: Wikipedia): 

Again, there is no further indication of a conspiracy or active support by Sidney for facilitating the escape of Bonaparte's (notice that the Wikipedia article says "citation needed" when suggesting so.) Just this: 

I have read one brief account of military planning around the time of Roman emperor Constantine the Great (272 – 337) whereby the Roman navy's rowers could have been substituted by animals (source citation: Anon. de rebus bell. 17,1 – 2). Do we know anything more about what animals would have been employed, what the proposed scheme was, and whether something along such lines was ever tried in war? The account mentions that the overall aim was to reduce labor cost. UPDATE I guess I better add more details about my sources before everybody starts thinking this is some kind of joke :) The brief account occurs on p. 365 of German historian Raimund Schulz' book Feldherren, Krieger und Strategen: Krieg in der Antike von Achill bis Attila. There's a footnote pointing to the aforementioned primary Latin source as well as to this French book as secondary source: M. Reddé: Mare nostrum. Les infrastructures, le dispositif et l'histoire de la marine militaire sous l'empire romain. And the history of warfare has known some strange war vessels indeed, such as the planned World War II air craft carrier made of pykrete (a mixture of wood pulp and ice) ... 

I have the impression that the term theoretical history sometimes serves as a synonym for studying alternative paths of history in the past (i.e. alternative history) or in the future (i.e. futurology). Consider e.g. this amateur historian: His YouTube video World War Three: thoughts on the coming hegemonic war investigates a possible future sequence of events, and he calls himself "a student of theoretical history" (in one of the comments) also with reference to this contribution. 

Perhaps his own religion (if there was any) was an odd blend e.g. of Germanic (as in Nibelungen), Christian (as in his native culture), Hindu (as in Aryans and Vedic traditions), and Buddhist (perhaps as in earlier comment) fragments. Overall, I think this is a question without a clear single answer. 

Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) were elected by a set circle of prince-electors. Among them were both secular electors as well as the archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne. In principle promotion in the ranks of the Roman Catholic church was possible also for commoners also back then. E.g. clearly not all abbots or ordinary bishops where from the (high) nobility, although I assume most archbishops were. So do we know if all the archbishops who served as (ecclesiastic) prince-electors during the centuries of the empire's existence belonged to noble families by birth (as would seem likely) or were there exceptions (as would seem possible on the face of it)? 

An "announcement" would also seem to make sense under the logic of nuclear deterrence. I can't confirm whether Power's communication contained the verbatim phrase DEFCON 2, but perhaps it did, because at this point (one hopes) nobody wanted to issue ambiguous commands. 

Unfortunately at present I cannot remember how events unfolded in this book's account, so I'd rather direct you to it rather than revisiting it myself all-too-quickly. BTW, I do remember repeating fun occurrences of Chiang's dentures in Taylor's biography of the great man :) 

What were the main inter-ethnic (racial, cultural, religious) dimensions of the 16th-century and perhaps earlier conflict in Switzerland that the author is referring to here? 

UPDATE: Mises' biographer Jörg Guido Hülsmann relates that his subject e.g. served as an officer in the Austrian-Hungarian army (i.e. before 1918), that he held an Austrian passport (expired by 1939), and that he was issued an American passport (in 1964). The facsimile (included on p. 833 of the biography) shows that American officials considered Austria (e.g. not Poland) as his birthplace, perhaps again meaning that he had been in possession of an Austrian passport around or before the time when the application was made. 

As also indicated in my earlier comment, IMHO you can't hope for any definite answer to a question such as this one, the more so the "older" any conceivable numbers may get. 

In 30 BC Cleopatra, Mark Anthony, and Caesarion (Ptolemy Caesar) famously met their deaths in the aftermath of the Battle of Actium at the dawn of the Roman Empire and the Augustan Age. Ronald Syme (in The Roman Revolution) provides this account of the Ptolemaic dynasty's demise in Egypt: 

For a partial answer, you can work backwards from the birth dates of prominent students. It was customary to start this kind of education after finishing high school at the age of 18: A Benjamin Strasser (1888–1955) did so in 1905. As for the admission process, the place and time suggests to me that once the applicant was able to muster the basic requirements (high school diploma and suitable examples of artistic works) it would most likely have come down to an individual decision by the admitting faculty member: much more like in an apprenticeship system than SAT scoring, say. UPDATE: So it turned out that there is more concrete information in Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man: 

He does not buy into historical rumors about the planned assassination of Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin at the 1943 Tehran Conference (Operation Long Jump, claims of which may have been a Soviet propaganda effort). Operation François also in 1943, a German parachute mission to make contact with the dissident mountain tribes to encourage them to sabotage Allied supplies, seems to be better sourced, if also ineffective. German radio propaganda was broadcasted e.g. from Athens. I don't know how far it reached and whether it may have called for sabotage next to the obvious anti-Semitic agitation. Overall, it seems at least in Iran there were neither direct nor effective (from a Nazi German point of view) operations to destroy supply routes in the Persian corridor in World War II. 

I found this interview with historian Josiah Ober on the economy of ancient Greece, particularly Athens, interesting on many counts. From the transcript: 

Following-up on @FelixGoldberg's answer I found this in Sources and Notes of Vincent Cronin's Napoleon: 

I see Adolf Hitler more in a materialistic than a religious tradition. He seemed to hold largely instrumental, secularist views on religions, and from this perspective occasionally had quasi-benign things to say also about Jewish religion. The following quote (from Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship) is from communication by Hitler to Otto Wagener in 1930: 

I cannot offer definite proof right now, but I'm almost certain (von) Mises was an Austrian citizen at least sometimes before his forced emigration to Switzerland. Consider e.g. this: 

It cites Conversations avec General Bertrand à St. Helena as its source. A couple of things look odd about this: 

Mathematician Alain Connes cites a French legal rule that explicitly accounts for propagation of information at finite speeds substantially below the speed of light: 

As for by whom, e.g. various Wikipedia articles provide names of architects who were invited to work in Bulgaria (e.g. Friedrich Grünanger). While the extent of "renovation" may be larger than elsewhere because of politics of the time, other European capitals also saw considerable renovations in the 19th century, e.g. during Georges-Eugène Hausmann's modernization program in Paris (in the 1860s) or during expansion of the city center in Vienna (after razing of the city walls after 1857). This was also a time when railroads significantly expanded, and this also must have had major architectural effects on many cities. 

It inspires this question about history: What in particular do we know about individual Buddhists in Alexandria and Rome? What traces, if any, have they left in recorded history? 

Here is one data point (from Jakob Burckardt's The Age of Constantine the Great) presumably among very many and already self-contradictory (translation courtesy of Google :) 

It is apparently a flag derived from a generic honors emblem: For comparison, look at these Canadian Victory Loan Flags and those Australian Honour Flags. There are also a similar items (e.g. WWI sons town flag) for sale on eBay. The designs were apparently all used for public fund raising by the allied powers during WW I and they share the same generic (red) border. There is also a related article in the New York Times archive ("HONOR FLAG CHOSEN FOR THE LIBERTY LOAN", March 7, 1918) with this explanation: 

The 11th ed. of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (published in 1911) provides a specific answer as to when. The why can perhaps be inferred from its somewhat anti-Turkish language (tortuous, mean) and the historical events around independence in 1879. 

The formal German-Japanese relationship in World War II (as part of the Axis) was established in the Tripartite Pact of 1940 (see also Anti-Comintern Pact). 

I've read in Nils Johan Ringdal's delightful but ill-footnoted Love For Sale: A World History of Prostitution that the apostle Paul was influenced by Orphism when he set out to weaken women's roles in Christian theology to come. I'm wondering: Is this a respectable theory from the point of historic scholarship and which authorities in the field may Ringdal have cited? 

The crucial phrase here is "with much oversimplification". I am wondering what could be the larger trend manifesting in the history of ideas that Weinberg is referring to: his observation of "the ascendancy of the culture of the image" seems obvious enough in our time, and one could conjecture that the culture of the word had scored an earlier victory with the invention of the printing press, say. The dichotomy also seems to relate to a contrast between exact/more intuitive modes of thinking and expression that is sometimes attributed to West/East (or modernism/postmodernism, or even Wittgenstein I/II :). If the trend has been observed (and named) by historians of ideas, do they describe it as a back-and-forth between (suitable generalizations of) the cultures of the image and the word respectively across times and cultures, or is it more of a uniform ascendancy of the culture of images perhaps facilitated by progress in technology and the factoid that everything might have been said (but not by everyone) in certain areas? Or is there no larger trend in history and these are just sentimental words from an elder (and wise) individual of a kind that is perhaps constant across generations? 

Hamann cites her original sources (as one would expect), and she also names the key faculty members involved (in a fragment I did not yet cite). 

Publication of the telegram in the U.S. helped to sway public opinion against Germany, though. Foreign Secretary Zimmermann had misjudged this effect (he evidently thought its surfacing would rather help the German cause). All in all, I think the Zimmermann telegram is more of an epiphenomenon (from the President's perspective, a helpful device towards executing a set strategy) than a necessary cause for the U.S. entering World War I. So yes, I think the U.S. would have entered the war event without the telegram's existence. 

The Library of Congress has a search engine where you can search specifically for maps. E.g. the search term "1600" leads to some historical maps. 

There are enough mentionings of Mozart e.g. in the Wikipedia article on Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849), another child prodigy, classical music composer, and pianist who died young, to convince me that Mozart was studied and taken seriously for one by the French musical elite in the (early) 19th century, i.e. well before WW II. 

I get the impression that squires would have remained at the periphery of the core battle zone, helping their knights in preparations as they mounted their horses or drew new weapons. Battles would have begun as highly stylized affairs, but as these things go: once one side gained a decisive advantage, all gloves would have been off and squires and other bystanders would have had to "improvise" and struggle for survival. Tuchman includes accounts where the strength of a lord's force is head-counted in knights, squires, other men-at-arms, archers, and foot soldiers, which may indicate that squires (along with their knights an other force elements) became involved in battle fairly regularly and perhaps (also) at early stages.
