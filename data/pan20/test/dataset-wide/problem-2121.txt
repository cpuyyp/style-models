If you do go to the interview with company B tell Company B during the interview that you have an offer with company A but you are interested; unless of course you aren't interested. When juggling multiple applications you will have perfect jobs with great offers, that don't materialize at the right time. That is life. The company has the same problem only a subset of great employees are available at the right time. 

What they actively check because of time and people constraints is different from what they collect but don't review, and is also different from what they can collect. They own the equipment, they own the data on the equipment, and they own the resources you used (network, power...). Regardless of the size of the IT department, or even if there is an IT department, they can scan or confiscate the computer any time they want. Assume that they can do anything. But will they resort to key loggers? They might if they suspect hat you are doing something illegal. Virus scan requirements, the use of screen lock timers, and the like are enforced to protect their data. Blocking of websites is done to avoid the use of their machines on potentially illegal or dangerous sites, or sites that are time wasters. Restricting software installation privileges is done to protect their system from viruses or the installation of unapproved or cracked software. 

For the purposes of the this answer I am assuming that the handover of information and material is being handled separately. I have been that remote person. One suggestion to show appreciation is to provide a gift certificate to a very nice place. Because everybody has different tastes you will need their cooperation when selecting the location/business. The risk of trying to do anything via video chat is the problem that you will have reinforced the idea that they were never a true part of the team. I would want to avoid the appearance that the main part of the team is having more fun than the person that is supposed to be the guest of honor. If there is a real desire to have a ceremony, you could still do a video/audio link during a staff meeting but keep it short maybe only 5-10 minutes. It would be an opportunity to publicly thank them, without the need to plan a very elaborate event. Of course if the handover must be done in person, you could just decide to invite them for the day, pay the transportation cost, and still give them the gift certificate and a team lunch. 

When moving from Company A to Company B the job title are almost irrelevant. I have worked for companies that have very detailed title and job descriptions, and I have worked for companies that lumped all technical jobs into one track with 5 levels. Therefore nobody is overly concerned about what job title you have on your resume, they care about the description and what you have accomplished. Now within a company job titles do matter. They get mapped to salary ranges, some are at the top of their track and some are at the bottom. For the same pay you would prefer a tile that does allow for salary growth without requiring a promotion; but you also want to know that there is another title above your current title. Without room to grow you can lose motivation to improve, and your pay will stagnate. In some cases managers are too strict about titles when reviewing internal candidates, and refuse to acknowledge that the specific title was selected due to funding constraints are the need to fit a person into a project org chart. They sometimes eliminate a great candidate because of a perceived mismatch of title. Ask your manager where this title fits in the company list of job title to decide if that particular title will limit your growth. 

Ask the company for a list of topics and material, otherwise this is just safety theater. Putting the responsibility on the employee to pick a safety topic, prepare for the talk, and present the material shows a lack of seriousness of the requirement. They didn't provide a mechanism to determine if the safety information is even correct or relevant. 

tells me nothing. It tells me that it is easier on you, but it tells me that the other days are still acceptable even if they are sub-optimal. I know that if you have a job your ability to talk during business days may be limited. I know that if you are a student you have class times when you are unreachable. But because I am likely to send you an email immediately if I can't reach you via phone, the fact Tuesdays and Fridays work best is not a concern. Telling me these things too early doesn't help with scheduling. I only need to know it when it comes time to schedule the interviews. 

But you don't make clear on your resume/cover letter your citizenship, or your status regarding a work visa. You must make it clear what your status is. If the company is not prepared to hire a foreigner because of the paperwork issues, then they will disregard your resume even before contacting you. Which is a pity because the issue can be easily avoided. A non-US number isn't an issue. US citizens do go out of the country for school. Other US citizens do reside for a variety of reasons outside the Unites States. The purpose of the resume is to convince the company that you meet their qualifications for the job. When they are done reading it they shouldn't wonder if you are even eligible to work. 

You accepted the offer with the new company. That is the only thing that you need to tell them. Unless there is some other obligation you have: must work for X years after tuition or training or owe them the cost of the benefit; accepting moving expenses and need to pay it back if you leave within X years; they can't really stop you. Many questions on this site ask about trying to determine if you should stay with the old company. Many times people find out that the promised benefit by the old company never materializes, or they are never trusted by the old company again. Accepting the increased offer by the old company frequently just delays the time frame of the move to another company. Sit though the meeting with the managers, be polite; and then thank them for the offer, but tell them you have made a commitment to join the new company. Finish the notice period, and enjoy your new job. 

Keep in mind that most people will not see your resume in the form you are hoping for. Most resumes today are either scanned for keywords; or are entered by cutting and pasting it into small text boxes as part of the application process. Using logos will mean that the keyword scanner never sees the certification, unless you also include the words. But if you include the words you are wasting real estate with the duplication of information. Using logos when the data must be entered into the small text boxes will require you to remember to include the words because the logos can't be pasted into a text box. There is frequently given advice to paste your entire resume into a text editor to see how it looks with almost zero formatting. Your case would be a perfect example of a resume that would have a problem in text only form.

The background paperwork will generally ask for you to explain any gaps in employment during the last X years. If that is the case, or if they ask for you to list all employers, then you have no choice but to include it. Don't try to fudge starting and ending dates for the employers surrounding that two month job, or you risk it being discovered when the other employers don't have the same work periods you claim on the background check. The punishment if you get caught can be as severe as immediate termination. Note: resumes are not the same as your entire employment history. Skipping a small job on a resume isn't a problem, but be prepared to explain any gaps during the interview. They might ask the employer, job title, time period, major tasks, and why you left. 

They can put any time limit on it that they want. The biggest concern is that they haven't given you an offer. 

For former employers see the answer above. Of course there is no risk that you can get fired by a former employer. 

Rule number 1: don't be late. Assuming you have been given the name of the restaurant then determine if they have a dress code. You will want to dress just as you would for a regular interview, with the additional requirement that you meet the standards of the restaurant. It is never wrong to be over-dressed for the restaurant, but very bad to be under-dressed for the restaurant. The reservation should either be in the name of the partner or the name of the company. That is how you will find them. The staff at the restaurant will escort you to his table. If they are not at the restaurant, wait for them to arrive. If the place doesn't take reservations you will have to call them a few minutes before the agreed time to meet. I wouldn't call the person before the agreed to time. Treat this as any other interview. If you didn't call them multiple times to confirm the initial interview, then don't call multiple times for this one. You may want to drive buy the restaurant to find parking or public transportation in advance. This prevents confusion in the critical minutes before the meeting. Also decide what you will order before going to the restaurant. Pick items at the lower prices levels. Take the partners lead on the question of alcohol, but decide what you will order based on the options. 

You need to ask the specific question of your company."how does vacation accrual work?" But you also need to ask can you go negative, and is there a deadline for getting back to zero. For example if you earn x hours per check but you will not have enough by the time you need to take a day of vacation can you go a few hours in the hole? Some will let you go negative as long as you get back to zero by the end of the year. Others will not let you go negative. Some will limit you to not more than 40 hours negative. You should also ask if they will allow for a flexible schedule. Sometimes they will let you work longer days around the day you need to take off. This allows you to tend to personal business and not need to take a day of vacation. 

Your company has fallen for the trap of open plan offices. They have decided the ability to micro-control noise, lighting, temperature, and privacy would be sacrificed to either save money or to chase the dream of perfect collaboration. The fact that their normal mode of doing their job (constant talking on their phones) interferes with your normal mode of doing your job is the problem. The question is why you are close enough to them if you don't have to work with them. You should be place closer to those on your team, or to those doing similar work. That is the reason why open plan should be used. The fact that work area can be re-arranged; and that other structures besides rigid walls could be use for separation and privacy; was suppose to be a strength. Unfortunately many organizations don't move people when situations change. You should suggest to your manager that moving will help you perform your job. Come up with multiple suggestions based either on environment or collaboration. You could also try other ways to block out their voices, but you shouldn't talk to your co-workers. They are doing their job. Even if they were to drop the worst of their habits: speaker phone; the issue would still remain.
