Let's say you were from the Middle Ages, 1200s England or Germany, and you got thrown back in time to the Iron Age. It's still the same place, but it's 400 BC. Apart from the language, what would you actually notice as being different? How was everyday life any different in the Iron Age than in the Middle Ages? (Yes, this is a rather fuzzy question, but I'm hoping to get some good insights from people.) 

The Thule people, ancestors of today's Inuit, are said to have migrated or spread from their homeland in Alaska all the way to Greenland in the far east. How long did this migration take? Was it within a single lifetime? Did it take many generations? I've seen various articles for laymen that claim this migration took anywhere from as little as two years to as much as two centuries. What's the current academic consensus on this one? 

Door hinges are very old, but they've usually been made out of iron or bronze. Before metal was widely available and inexpensive, what did common people use for door hinges? 

In other words, the majority of Roman emperors (67%) died a violent death. Then again, you'll need to define a few points more clearly if you want a better answer: 

Many surviving classical temples and palaces in the Levant and Asia appear to have been built by the Romans. Are there any notable ones that still survive today that where built specifically during the reign of the Seleucid kings (312 BC- 63BC)? 

photo taken from this forum So my question is, when was the Mosque inside the parthenon actually demolished? Do we have a date for it? Also a bonus question, do we know if the original photo taken by Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière in October, 1839 still exists? or has that since been lost? 

But according to Cyril of Alexandria in the 5th century, St John Chrysostom was labelled as the "over-thrower of the temple of Diana". Suggesting that he was responsible for the temple's destruction. A similar mention is also given by Proclus of Constantinople who says "In Ephesus, he despoiled the art of Midas". This may allude to the temple of Artemis. Do we have a definitive answer as to when the temple was destroyed? 

The article does not list a source for this information and i cant seem to find any further information about it. Is there any evidence Hagia Sophia was built on the foundations of a pagan temple? 

You'd be hard pressed to find a country with more assassinated leaders than ancient Rome. By at least one count, out of 84 emperors (not counting any eastern emperors from Leo I onwards): 

Did the Mayans have plantations of cacao trees, or did they simply gather the fruit from cacao trees in the wild? 

Are there any maps still surviving that were made in the Byzantine Empire? There are plenty of maps from Western Europe during this time period, but I haven't heard of any surviving from the eastern empire. 

In the 1200s the Mongols conquered Persia (and a few other places). The portion of the empire in Persia was known as the Ilkhanate, ruled over by the ilkhan. Influenced by Chinese paper money, the ilkhan Gaykhatu introduced paper money in his realm, but it was a disaster, and was generally not accepted for trade. Does anyone know what the ilkhan's paper money looked like? Or has it been lost to time? Chinese/Yuan money of that era is still known: 

In 1657 a group of English Quakers arrived in New Amsterdam (the Dutch colonial town that became modern New York City). They were persecuted by the colonial government there for their religion. Then in 1663 the colony's bosses - the directors of the Dutch West India Company - ordered the governor to allow Quakerism in the colony. The Company considered the Quaker religion "abominable", yet reversed the governor's policy of persecution, a policy that was entirely in line with the practices of most other European colonies of the day. Why did they order the change? 

According to the Public Record Office of Victoria website, the secretary of the Victorian Racing Club, R.C. Bagot asked for it from the Chief Secretary’s Department: 

Here is a byzantine mosaic map. The city at the bottom (ΙΕΡΙΧW) is Jericho and the Sea on the right is the Dead Sea. I wasnt able to find a source of this map. 

A map manuscript of the world by the monk Cosmas Indicopleustes (Cosmas "the one who sailed to India") survives today: Wikipedia describes the map as follows: 

With the alliance in place, the Romans would have to further stretch their forces and resources to the east so as to counteract any possible Macedonian offensive. The Macedonians had numerous things to gain from the defeat of Rome: 

So as for sources "testifying the existence of Macedonia" Yes there are plenty of sources mentioning a "Macedonia" but bear in mind that between the 7th -19th centuries, the definition of "Macedonia" had changed significantly. From a Roman province, to Byzantine Theme, to Bulgarian region, to Latin region, to Serbian region and so on.. As for sources "testifying the existence of ... Macedonian people" The best you'll get are minor references to people from the region regardless of their language or ethnicity. 

I've seen some sources claiming it was Thomas Jefferson and others claiming it was Adlai Stevenson. It could be that Stevenson was quoting Jefferson, but I haven't found any credible-looking sources for this being a Jefferson quote. Ideally, I'd like to know who said this, when they said it, and where. 

There's no citation listed, unfortunately. So is there any reliable archaeological evidence of this flood? Can anyone point me in the right direction? A few feet of sediment means there must have been a major event, so I'm surprised I hadn't run across this before. 

According to the Treaty of New Echota, ratified by the US Senate in 1836, the US government was supposed to pay the Cherokee Nation $5 million for their lands in and around Georgia. In exchange, the Cherokee would leave that region and settle across the Mississippi. Did the government actually pay the $5 million? I know there was a division among the Cherokee of whether to accept the treaty or not, and most of them chose to remain on their land, then being forcibly removed (which is a different sad story). But the removal of the Cherokee was done under the auspices of the Treaty of New Echota, so was the payment required by the treaty ever made? 

I recently came across an article about the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocattis and learned that he wrote about the reunification of China by Emperor Wen. I also know that Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote somewhat about China 60-90 years earlier than Simocattis. Were their any historians in the Greco-Roman world that preceded the two above that gave anything more than a mere mention to the societies of China? 

Officially, If you were a Muslim in Greece, you could be exempt from compulsory deportation if you were: 

You can see by the actions of Demosthenes how much of a hindrance one man under the influence of Persian gold could be. He had convinced the Athenian assembly to send an army with allied Thebans and Boeotians to meet the Macedonians at Chaeronea and be decisively beaten. This resulted in the destruction of the city of Thebes and the end to the conflict which brought most of Greece under Phillip's control. 

So it was Demetrius and Phillip's threat to Roman occupied Illyria and also to Italy itself which prompted the Romans to intervene militarily. 

- Diplomacy and Displacement: Reconsidering the Turco-Greek Exchange of populations, 1922-1934 (Onur Yildirim, pg 249) If your identification papers read that you where Orthodox and not Muslim, you where exempt from the population exchange. Furthermore, marriage in the Orthodox church requires that both husband and wife must profess the Christian faith. Therefore those Muslim men and women who married into Orthodox families had to convert as a pre-requisite to their marriage.
