The apparent reason for the creation of these Slavic "multinational" states was to create states that were strong enough to act as "buffer states" against Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria (Germany's allies in World War I). Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania would, in fact go on to form the "Little Entente", with which France later formed an alliance. So these states were probably created for reasons of Realpolitik, not to benefit the "nationalities." 

My answer is only hinted at the following piece. $URL$ But there is a key line that says that Bohemia escaped the Black Plague that affected much of the rest of Europe. That would be sufficient to attract "flight capital" from the rest of Europe seeking a "safe haven" from afflicted areas. Bohemia appears to be the beneficiary of such a phenomenon. Plus the fact that its kings of the period were generally regarded as unusually wise (in the manner of King Solomon). That is another attractor of investment capital, even to this day. 

I can think of two. The first was at Stirling Bridge, in 1297 when the English outnumbered the Scots some 4 to 1, but the 72-year old English commander, John Warrenne, Earl of Surrey was not keen on giving battle in swampy land where the Scots were "at home." But the 40-year old Hugh de Cressingham led half the army (the part under his control) across Stirling Bridge against orders. When half of this force was across the bridge, the Scots attacked from ambush at the odds of 1- to 1, crushed both halves of Cressingham's force, and even carried the battle successfully to Warrenne's remaining troops. The second was the Waterloo campaign, after the defeat of the Prussians by Napoleon at Ligny. There, the badly wounded 72-year-old Marshal Blucher insisted on leading the remnants of his defeated army to Waterloo to reinforce Wellington, over the objections of the much-younger Gneisenau. The Prussians made it to Waterloo on time with sufficient reinforcements, and the rest is history. Are there other instances where military commanders of very different ages were of the opposite opinion? What were the results? 

Yes, Libery Poles still exist today, although in a slightly different form. They were the precursor of what we now call flagpoles. Most flagpoles are now made of metal, rather than wood, and are therefore more durable. But they are places on which to hang flags, which function as our symbols of freedom and liberty. So have liberty poles retained their original form? Not quite. But do they exist in an "evolved" form that serves the original purpose? Yes. 

It depends on how you define "Manchu." The Sibe (Xibe) were NOT the same as the Jurchen tribe, the one that is generally regarded as "Manchu." What IS true is that the Sibe lived in the center of present day Manchuria, next to the Jurchens. By that very loose definition, they are "Manchu." The Jurchens defeated the Sibe (and others) in 1593, and took over their territory. The Sibe were peacefully absorbed under "Manchurian" (Jurchen) rule, and redeployed to Xinjiang, in China's northwest, where they were needed as a buffer against Russia. The Xibe language has eight vowel distinctions compared to six for the Manchu. But their written language is a modified form of the Manchu, and overall, it can be considered a dialect of Manchu $URL$ So one can say that the Xibe people are "similar to" (but not the same as) the Manchu people. 

Crispus Attucks was the oldest of the victims of the Boston Massacre. Born in 1723, he was the only member of the "Great Awakener" generation (of Jonathan Edwards and Benjamin Franklin), and a likely instigator of the riots. Younger, more pragmatic people were killed mainly for "showing up." Attucks was also partly an African American (and partly Native American). As such, he was idolized by the Abolitionist movement of the 19th century that originated in Boston. It was they, and not the Revolutionary War generations, that cemented his place (retroactively) in history. 

Alexander the Great conquered what was then the known, "civilized" world. The four early civilizations were the Egyptian, Babylonian, "Indian" and Chinese. Babylon was part of the Persian Empire, which Alexander defeated. Egypt was conquered next. Shortly before his death, Alexander penetrated to the Indus Valley, which was then the heart of "Indian" civilization based in modern Pakistan and Punjab. Only China was "missing." She was remote from, and (at the time) smaller than the other three civilizations. By the standards of his time, Alexander had conquered the "world" known to him and the Greeks. The fifth and sixth civilizations were the Greeks and the Romans. Alexander (or rather his father) had conquered the Greeks. When Alexander died in 323 BCE, no one knew that Rome would soon be "the next big thing." At the time, it was just one of the "barbarian" lands to the west. But if Alexander had died a century or two later, he would not have conquered the known "world" unless his conquests included Rome. 

Attitudes toward miscegenation were governed by two factors: 1) the degree of antagonism toward minorities and 2) the perceived "threat" posed by large minorities. The "North" (the former Union states) were the most tolerant to minorities. In the Northeast, the number of minorities was relatively large, but the degree of antagonism was small. In the Midwest, the degree of antagonism was larger, but the perceived threat was smaller. That's why most of these states either did not have, anti-miscegenation laws or abolished them in the 19th century. In the Far West, the degree of antagonism (mostly against Chinese and other Asians) was initially large. This dissipated after World War II, and with such minorities being a relatively small part of the population, the actual fear was relatively small, which is why the anti-miscegenation laws were abolished shortly after World War II. In the South (the former Confederacy and border states), anti-minority, particularly anti-black sentiment was at a maximum, and there was also a large fear of large minority populations, which is why the laws remained until 1967. Please refer to twosheds' excellent map for the relevant dates. 

Lesser men failed to believe him, and paid the price. Put another way, the risk was (fairly) "evaluated" by Pitt and not understood by others. 

There were several reasons: 1) The inhabitants of British North America were either "settlers" or descendants of settlers, which is to say that they were more entrepreneurial (and rebellious) than "natives" of other colonies. Amy Chua has published a book on how market dominant" groups tend to come from "outside" an area. More to the point, entrepreneurs are natural enemies of "red tape," and government regulations generally. 2) The "13 Colonies," did not have the experience of being conquered or defeated by Britain, unlike even Canada (taken from the French). 3) The inhabitants of British North America were of British descent, which is to say that they had the vicarious experience of the British fight for "rights" going back to the Magna Carta (1215) and Glorious Revolution (1689). Also the "Right of Man" of the European Enlightenment. British colonials in Africa and Asian didn't have these advantages. Also, Anglo-Americans enjoyed the weaponry and other technological advantages of the home country, and the ability to enlist the aid of France and other European countries in their war for independence. 4) North America was sparsely populated, providing an incentive for revolutionaries to break away and enjoy a much larger (physically) country under self-government. Other British colonies would merely return to the "status quo ante," which was not necessarily preferable to British rule. South American colonies rebelled against Spain and Portugal for similar reasons. 

In January 1943, America's President Roosevelt and Britain's Winston Churchill held a conference in Casablanca, Morocco. Russia's Stalin declined to attend (citing the fighting at Stalingrad). One "real" reason may be that there was no totally safe, clear, path from Moscow to Morocco. (Stalin attended a later conference in Tehran, Iran, in November 1943, with the two others, at a place and time that was probably safer than Casablanca in January, 1943.) This was at a time when there was a German army (and air force) at large in Tunisia, and German submarines were operating through most of the Atlantic Ocean (although their level of activity around North Africa was unexpectedly low). In February, 1943, the Germans under Rommel launched a counterattack through Kasesrine Pass, which, had it succeeded, might have driven the Anglo-American armies back across Algeria, toward Morocco. Was it possible, under the circumstances, for the Allied armies, fleet and air force to "guarantee" the safety of the two world leaders? Or did Roosevelt and Churchill deliberately hold a conference in a "dangerous" place to (quite literally) "rally the troops?" 

Austria had annexed Bosnia-Hercegovina in 1908, and was looking to swallow Serbia next. It is in this context that the ultimatum be understood. The Austrian ultimatum not only demanded that Serbia allow her to prosecute the perpetrators of the assassination, but help Austria find and punish officials that may have helped them. It went much further by asking that Serbia allow Austria to suppress "anti-Austrian" feelings in Serbia in the press, and allow Austria to dictate the firing of any educator, military officer or government official deemed by Austria to be "anti-Austrian,. Article 6, the one term Serbia rejected outright, was that Austrian officials would be allowed to enter Serbia to oversee the enforcement of the terms of the ultimatum. Serbia also hedged on articles 4 and 5 by claiming that she would accept them under the terms and conditions provided by international law. She categorically denied only Article 6. Basically, Serbia was willing to accept "justice," just not "Austrian" justice. The result of the Austrian ultimatum was that Austria could fire any official in Serbia who was "anti-Austrian" to the slightest degree, replacing them with pro Austrian officials, thereby leading to an annexation of Serbia. Put another way, Austria tried to impose an Anschluss on Serbia like the one that was actually imposed on Austria some 24 years later by Hitler, who demanded that the existing Austrian government resign in favor of a Nazi government led by Artur Seyss-Inquart. The only document even remotely close in International Relations, was Japan's 21 demands on China in 1915. Even Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany was more than satisfied with Serbia's response, stating that "Serbia had made a capitulation of the most humiliating kind." Only the Austrians were dissatisfied, because they wanted an immediate war and annexation, not a "crawling" takeover of Serbia. 

The Czechs were evacuated on mostly American ships, such as could be made available from time to time. Which is why many of them went through the Panama Canal. Some went through the Indian Ocean on British or even Japanese ships (Japan was an Ally in World War I, and co-operated with America in securing Vladivostok). This was a pet project of President Woodrow Wilson, who first wanted to redeploy the Czech troops on the Western front (until the war ended abruptly in 1918). Then, they became an important part of point 10 of his 14 points. This was self-determination for the peoples of Austria-Hungary, which in practice meant the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia, among other things. The U.S. fronted $12 million to send the Czechs home, which the Czech government agreed to repay over time. The British received a smaller amount on a "cash and carry" basis. 

So your 18th century timetable is right, as is your claim of Islamic origins. They became more popular in India, where they were used for weddings, than in Iran, their original home. 

If you count areas occupied by China that has less than a majority of Han Chinese people, either today or at least when first claimed, then China has numerous colonies along its western borders; Sinkiang, Tibet, parts of Mongolia, etc. The reason why China is not considered "colonialist" in the usual sense of word is because historically, it has NOT had Chinese settlements in lands that were "noncontiguous" to China. For instance, during the Ming dynasty, Admiral Zheng He (and numerous admirals before him), visited parts of modern Indonesia, India, the Middle East and Africa, (some say, even western North America), but did not establish Chinese settlements in these places or try to conquer them. This is in contrast to European countries that later did conquer these areas. 

One noble present at the Tennis Court Oath was the Marquis de Lafayette. He had been schooled in the American Revolution, and was about to embark on the French Revolution. 

There are a few reasons. The first was that France's crises were resolved more quickly, and earlier (by the end of the 18th century) than those of some other European countries (more like 19th century). The French Revolution might have induced emigration to the U.S., except that it was tied up with threat of foreign invasion, meaning that many were caught up in the patriotic fervor of the time. Also France, unlike many other countries, enjoyed a long period of "peace and prosperity after the Napoleonic Wars (except in 1870-71, while other countries' upheavals were just starting. All this meant that French 19th century emigration to the U.S. was less than those of many other countries. A second reason was that the French had other landing spots in North America. One of them was French-speaking Quebec (Canada). A second was French-speaking "Louisiana," which didn't become part of the U.S. until 1803. And as a commenter pointed out, the French (and British) also had landing spots in Africa and Asia (e.g. Algeria and Indochina). So the French emigration was not fully reflected in French immigration to the U.S. A third issue was that French immigration to North America (Canada, the 13 colonies or Louisiana) started earlier (17th century) than that of most other countries (except England). Put another way, the wave of French immigration started earlier, meaning that the 19th century wave was smaller by comparison to the more visible 19th century waves of other countries. Basically the French did a large share of their emigration before the U.S. became the U.S; the people of other countries did theirs afterward.
