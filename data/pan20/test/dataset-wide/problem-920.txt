The resemblance is mostly thematic. According to Bono (lead vocalist and primary lyricist of U2), the main thing they took from Blake was the idea of comparing innocence and experience: 

A "settled wind" means the same as a steady wind: one whose direction has settled. (For some reason, the best sources I can find for this are translation sites.) This is as opposed to shifting winds - those whose direction keeps changing, making them hard to predict and to steer by. The important thing about wind is usually its direction, not its strength, until you get up to really strong winds. When the wind direction keeps changing, the waves tend to be more confused and harder to steer in. From this article about waves: 

The object of "palisado'd" here is implied by context: it's the parapet being stormed by "our men". The subject is the "ignorance" only symbolically: it was the 'Cohorn' who palisado'd the parapet, but it was their ignorance which screwed up the job. 

Let's be honest, there isn't really much room among those mere 16 words for "affection" or any other emotion to shine through very strongly. This seems to be the best anyone's been able to come up with (from the same source as above): 

Maybe Williams was talking nonsense. It's not unknown for authors, including poets, to just make stuff up when talking later on about the inspirations for their work. I found this article (mostly hidden behind a paywall, sorry - I'll include lengthy quotes here) which speculates that: 

I tend to think of the word trinket as suggesting not only small size and low value, but a small-minded owner, one who obsesses over possessions and ascribes them more value than they really have: the sort of person to whom the phrase "little things please little minds" is ideally suited. The term trinket itself is slightly derogatory - it refers to a thing that's almost worthless, but presumably it has some worth to its owner - and therefore by extension suggests that the owner is superficial to care about it. Let's compare that impression with how Effie is depicted in the books. 

The point of the passage you quote is to contrast "the original church", with its quaintness so typical of the English countryside, with the new "modern Gothic" building, described in much less romantic terms. It's a gentle putdown to the spread of modern ways and architecture in the rural regions that Hardy loved so much. Note that: 

This is a sign that things are escalating: the atmosphere has shifted from a quiet, pervading dread to a frantic, hysterical terror. We've already seen the change in Roderick Usher's demeanour, the increase in his symptoms and excitement, and even the narrator being affected enough for insomnia. With this description of the storm outside, we get the feeling that the story has just shifted up another gear. This prepares us for the terror of Madeline's reappearance at the climax. Again, imagine if instead the weather outside was as oppressively still as at the start of the story, the air dull and heavy and soundless. In that case, we might have been slower to accept how significantly the condition of both main characters has changed. The heightening terror throughout the reading of the Ethelred story would have been (slightly) lessened, since the weather is constantly mentioned or alluded to in subtle ways throughout these paragraphs - we're never permitted to forget it. The link between the building and the family I noticed these sentences while rereading the story just now, and at first didn't think much of them: 

The only sources cited by Wikipedia for these claims are articles in a few UK newspapers (the Daily Express, the Guardian, and the Independent). None of these are particularly reliable sources. But the fact that the Tolkien Society takes it seriously enough to help set up a Tolkien-themed "Ring Room" at Vyne is interesting, and lends the theory more weight. What evidence is there for the idea that Tolkien based his One Ring on the Ring of Silvianus? As far as I knew, Tolkien took most of his ideas from Germanic mythology, so a real-life inspiration like this is interesting. Evidence could come either from the text itself or from any kind of extratextual material - other writings set in Middle-Earth, Tolkien's letters or notes, ... Even a reference to an academic paper about this, rather than just newspaper articles, would be appreciated. 

Jews as mice Spiegelman has actually spoken about this in an interview, and told us what inspired him to create this depiction. It seems that as well as the cat-and-mouse allegory (about which more later), there has been a long tradition of portraying Jews as rats or mice in anti-Semitic works. 

As far as I know, there's no such thing as a transformational set or an infragroup. As you note, Hogarth groups are clearly fictional, being named after a fictional character. 

Another source refers to a mere (!) 236-word sentence as the possible record. If these claims to fame for sentences not much more than half as long as the one you've found can be taken seriously, then yours may quite possibly be the record. As for the "story" behind these impressively extended and verbose sentences - clearly not just a one-off in Twain's writing, since there are several sentences scattered through his works which, although not as long as the example you've found, are nevertheless over two hundred words long and therefore pretty impressive and out of the ordinary - it may well be the case that the author was deliberately trying to create exceptionally long sentences for effect; partly, of course, longer sentences were simply more common in writing in those days, before the age of modernity, advertising and the internet, when people's attention spans shrank to the size of gnats' and it became necessary to impart information to them as swiftly and efficiently as possible before they went "TL;DR" and moved on to something more entertaining; partly, also, long sentences can be a practically useful writing device, as for instance when trying to include a great deal of description but make it feel compressed as though it's all happening at the same time (in your example, putting the entire description of the boat's motion and progress in a single sentence gives the reader the feeling that they're taking it all in at a single glance rather than reading about it piece by piece in a book; in the above description of a sunrise, again putting it all in one sentence is akin to compressing the experience into a single glance, the way it would be in the real world, rather than artificially extending it by a long wordy description); but in addition to their utility in writing, it may be that Twain was using these excessively long sentences for humorous effect or to make a point - a thesis supported, for example, by the following speech he once made in German on 21 November 1897, and for which he also wrote the entertainingly bad English translation which is provided below (a better translation is available here, but Twain's own has amusement value while still being comprehensible).1 

Impatient with the slow pace of his education under Ogion, and eager to impress the girl he's been spending time with, Ged tries to perform magic that he's not ready for yet. The result is that he apparently summons some form of evil into the house, which only his master is able to dismiss. Note the use of the word shadow to describe the thing that appears and whispers to him. Ogion then warns Ged about the danger inherent in the practice of magic: 

First of all, let me just point out two things which it may be useful to bear in mind when considering how seriously to take this answer: whether I'm overanalysing or underanalysing here. 

So how did that affection get into the writing? Where's the connection between the old Marshall and the poem? For reference, the full poem is only 16 words long and goes as follows: 

Probably some MySpace blog page(s) which are no longer available. This comic was published on 11 January 2008. Unfortunately the Wayback Machine doesn't seem to list results of Google searches. I went hunting around the internet and found a couple of leads: 

The claim that ABS and LLR stand for "Associate Back Scratcher" (not Associated as in the source you found) and "Licensed Log Roller" seems to be quite widespread. It appears in, among others, Faye Hammill's Women, Celebrity, and Literary Culture between the Wars; Bill Peschel's Writers Gone Wild: The Feuds, Frolics, and Follies of Literature's Great Adventurers, Drunkards, Lo vers, Iconoclasts, and Misanthropes; and assorted blog posts. Unfortunately, none of these books or internet pages cites a source for this claim, although they do provide slight circumstantial evidence by mentioning it as part of an argument that Gibbons was thumbing her nose at the literary elite and satirising established practices in literature. The most authoritative source I've been able to find is Lynne Truss's introduction to the 2006 edition: 

What this paragraph doesn't mention is that 4-speed transmission was already a thing even in the 1920s on some very high-end luxury cars. In particular, the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, said to be "the best car in the world", was manufactured as a 4-speed transmission from 1913 to 1926, while almost all other cars were still 3-speed transmissions. (This is comparable to the modern Porsche 991 starting with 7-speed transmission which most of us have never seen.) Gatsby's car, although its make isn't specified in the novel, is certainly high-end luxury and quite possibly a Rolls-Royce. Hence the question of whether the car's gearstick is standard shift (3-speed transmission) or the new alternative (4-speed transmission). This fits with Peter Shor's observation in a comment that, in context, the alternative to standard shift seemed to be harder than standard shift. 

Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors is set in the town of Ephesus, which is apparently a seaport with ships within walking distance of where the action takes place: 

The poem "A German Requiem" is full of contrasts, especially in the first and last stanzas with their repetitive structure and countless sentences of the form "It is not X. It is Y." In these particular lines, we're looking at a contrast between aloneness and togetherness: between sitting in your own house forgetting and taking part in a ceremony of forgetting together with others. Forgetting is the key concept in this poem. I think the following lines from the start of the third stanza are especially key to understanding what the poem is all about, because of their directness and transparency: 

The poem "The Lily" by William Blake must be one of the shortest of his Songs of Innocence and of Experience collection, only four lines long: 

Foxes are considerably smaller than wolves in reality, yet nobody batted an eye at this. One last piece of evidence for beetle size in the Redwall series is the water beetle Grubwhacker in the book Mossflower (one of very few other mentions of beetles throughout the series), who seems to be roughly the size of a large dog when compared to the shrew Log-a-Log: 

Siegfried Sassoon's short poem "The Hero" (full text here) is about a young soldier who has died in the First World War, and describes the news of his death being given to his grieving mother. When I studied this poem for an English literature GCSE, I remember disliking the character of the "Brother Officer", thinking him an arrogant, patronising man who had more contempt than sympathy for the dead man and his mother. So I was surprised to read commentary from an examiner which was much more positive about him and painted him as a sympathetic figure. How is the Brother Officer being portrayed in this poem? Especially since the poem is written from his point of view, this question should be answerable by close reading - perhaps the choice of words used to describe him or his thoughts can be analysed to deduce his attitudes. Answers which draw on extratextual information, such as Sassoon's attitude towards the army, would also be welcome. 

The man he was referring to was his good friend Edward Thomas. It seems that Frost's intended meaning in writing this poem was to poke fun at those who agonise over inconsequential decisions: 

The popular Christmas song "The Twelve Days of Christmas" has many different versions, but they're usually something along the lines of the following (final verse, which includes all the others): 

The character Captain Hook, main protagonist of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, definitely attended a British public school: 

The limerick is a type of poem which is short-form (therefore easy to write) and, according to Wikipedia, "often humorous and sometimes obscene". It's been greatly used by casual writers of poetry; there are a vast number of limericks which were never formally published and whose original sources are unknown or anonymous, and many of these are coarse or obscene. Given all of this, it's likely to be very hard to find a definite source for a limerick about which all we know is that it featured a lady named Jane who was a prostitute (or perhaps promiscuous). You greatly underestimate the wealth of limerick literature if you think there's likely to be just one or a few such limericks. To support my claim here, I'll quote and link to some examples of limericks which could fit the bill. Please note that some of these are VERY NSFW! I've hidden the text of the limericks behind spoilertags for this reason, but most of the links also contain many other limericks which are even dirtier; click them at your own risk. I found this one by Googling : 

Let's consider Gale's role in the plot of Mockingjay, analysing his character in depth. Gale equated with District 13 Gale is a wholehearted supporter of District 13 and the rebellion: he's a soldier serving Coin, and more than willing to kill for his cause. In this he contrasts with the more pacifist Peeta - it's not clear how much of Peeta's televised call for a ceasefire is genuine and how much he was forced to say by the Capitol, but in the vote for a 76th Hunger Games he's the first (and most vehement) to vote no. This contrast between Gale and Peeta unifies the romantic subplot with the main plot of the war: for Katniss, choosing Gale would equate to choosing anger and hatred of the Capitol, while choosing Peeta equates to choosing hope and recovery from the past. She says as much in the last chapter: 

I agree with the conclusion you've already posted: the lawyer upped the 5 years to 15 years because of impulsive pride. However, I think it's interesting to look at this in the wider context of the story, which is really all about pride and impulsiveness set against wisdom and patience. At the start of the story, both the banker and the lawyer are described as young men, foolish, who (presumably under the influence of alcohol) make a tremendous wager on the spur of the moment without realising its consequences. 

One vampire "meant" many, in the sense that when one vampire is created, many more will follow on its heels. In this case, one vampire (Mina) would mean at least two (Mina and Jonathan). He's surmising that each time a human was converted to a vampire in the past, they would often be joined in that state by others who loved them and didn't want them to suffer eternally alone. 

What's the explanation for this apparent mistake? Well, Occam's razor would say it actually is a simple mistake, and that Orwell wasn't aware of the defining characteristic of the song of one of the commonest British songbirds, despite choosing that song to describe at length in his novel. But what if there's a darker and more subtle explanation? Perhaps the thrush isn't a real thrush at all. Perhaps the Party has created believable fake birds to do some of their spying for them. Perhaps the unrealistic song of the thrush was an early indication that, even then, the Party was watching Winston and Julia's every move (as we discover much later on, they had certainly been watched since long before this scene). Or perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong dystopian novel and have jabberjays on the brain. I'm fairly sure I've read this theory elsewhere, and that perhaps it was even made explicit in one of the film adaptations of 1984. But I can't find any reference to it now, so my justification above, based only on the text and a knowledge of ornithology, will have to do.
