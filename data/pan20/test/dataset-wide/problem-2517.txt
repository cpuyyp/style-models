Based on your meditation background and current focus, it appears that perhaps you have cast your net too far to catch the kind of fish that you are looking for. As juvenile as this may seem, I stayed with guided meditation for some time before progressing further to a primarily breath based focus. Two helps: for guided meditation, I used and still use at times the “Insight Timer” app. Not only does it have the meditations, but also a timer for solo timed meditation, and groups that one can join of varied meditational topics for ideas and support, inspiration, motivation, etc. The second helper is YouTube video talks/Facebook groups and books of Thanissaro Bhikkhu. He makes breathing meditation interesting, “easy”, and above all his style is light but enlightening. I used analogy on another group to which I belong which may also be beneficial here. This though in terms of keeping the mind focused, free from chatter. If it ever truly gets that way. One takes an aspirin for a headache. The ache does not subside instantly, it takes time for the medicine to work. And, when one aspirin doesn’t do the job, it may take another to relieve the pain. Point is, keep at it. Over time you will be successful. It takes some longer than others. You will make it! 

I feel a little stressed out when I move my attention through the body to observe the sensations. I am able to meditate far better if I focus on the entire body as a whole and feel sensations wherever they come up. Is this acceptable in the S. N. Goenka Vipassana technique or is it important that a mediator scan the body part by part? 

Both Anapansati and Vipassana are described as the direct path to Nibbana. What are the main differences along these paths? Does one fully include the other, or do they diverge from each other, or they in a sense parallel to each? 

To the already very useful answers, I would like to add Joseph Goldstein's excellent book, Mindfulness: A Practical Guide To Awakening. He explains Buddhism from the perspective of the Satipatthana Sutta, so there is a huge focus on Mindfulness, but he does explain (very well) the Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold Noble Path as well. As the title explains the book is very hands on and practical in working with the mind, while also explaining enough of the theory that's required. I am still reading this book, but am really delighted with everything I have read. 

This may, perhaps, seem unrelated and off topic. But, how about Metta Meditation? Seems like a simple solution in some regards but would be interested to see if it answers your query after a few sittings. All the best. 

Truthfully, you don’t owe an explanation. There is no obligation. If asked, then yes, be clear on what the issue is or simply use something generic like “it’s a personal issue” or the like. If he is a true friend, there should already be a level of respect. All the best. 

If one is expected to have unshakable faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha and there is concern that an Ajahn's teachings may be inaccurate, is it still possible to take refuge? 

I could easily have written your query. At this time however there are a few differences which may be helpful if shared. Am in my mid 40’s. Never thought that it was actually possible. Met a Venerable at the local Vihara who stated otherwise and has taken me under his wing so to speak with ordination to be the outcome. Yes, it’s a long road, lots to learn. But if it’s truly in your heart, it will be. Make yourself visible and learn as much as you can from as many as are willing to share. Have you decided upon a school of thought? So much to consider. Please forgive for giving what equates to being advice, but the same is also my personal experience. Hope this is helpful in some small way. All the best to you. 

Many thanks to everyone who answered. All the answers got me to think of the issue in different ways and to refer to Suttas to get a better understanding. I recently came upon this article on the Bodhisattva Vows, and Hui-neng's explanation finally lit the lightbulb for me. Perhaps this is what Andrei and Buddo also meant. 

This concept works very well with meditation also. One way to generate motivation is to think of your current effort as the necessary labor to get the flywheel moving until it works in your favor and becomes second nature. 

Stream entry feels like a milestone where some very significant things happen and the practitioner cannot slide backwards from it. Do Zen sutras describe the concept of stream entry by that or any other name? 

In his book 'Good to Great', author Jim Collins describes how to build a great business using an analogy of a flywheel. 

Would really depend upon which school of thought you follow, and at that, which lineage. Some are as strict as to say that definitely yes, not permitted. Then there are most others that are more mainstream or even liberal in the interpretation of Buddha’s teachings. The question I would ask myself is - is there any other source that I can use without alcohol, and go from there. This, only if you are especially conservative in your approach to the precepts. If you do continue to consume Kombucha, perhaps consider switching to one with a lower alcohol content. They do vary among brands, sometimes widely. The bottle that I am looking at now states .5% by Vol, but I’ve seen both higher and lower amounts in other products. Please also consider the caffeine content if you are sensitive. 

Tantra exists in certain traditions of Buddhism (I guess mostly in Tibetan and certain Theravada schools as well). It also exists in Kashmir Shaivism, as explained in the Vijnana Bhairava. Can someone please help me understand how the schools Buddhism and Kashmir Shaivism differ (and are similar) in their approaches as well as goals for Tantric practices. 

Mental labeling is the act of saying 'sad' or 'happy', when such thoughts occur, without wanting anything to be different. The last part is important, because it means we are recognizing our states for what they are, but not judging them from the perspective of generating aversion of craving. Judging always has a little flavor of wanting or 'not wanting', or at least an opinion about something being good or bad. Labelling on the other hand is recognizing (and being with) what's there without any of the attached filters of the mind as Joseph Goldstein calls them. Perhaps not directly related to your question, but cultivating the right state of mind does sometimes involve discerning. However, the difference is in what we discern. We only discern our own state of mind as either skillful or unskillful in dealing with what is arising in the present moment. We do not judge that which is arising however.
