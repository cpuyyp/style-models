Second attempt.. How about Interpretation? "Interpretation" may mean an assignment of meanings to symbols and/or to objects.  So in one situation one may interpret a chair as a chair, in another situation as a ladder, in a third situation as a weapon... 

Hegel described himself in the case of dialectic (as in many others) as standing on the shoulders of Kant. Kant's antinomies of reason were examples of dialectic, which Hegel took to a much greater scale. 

Physically, perhaps the universe will come to a standstill, and from then on there won't be any more events. But I don't see any logical reason, something in the event concept itself, why an event can't go on forever. For example, consider a small round patch, whose colors change constantly. Or a particle that moves through space, and will never stop. Or a perpetuum mobile.. 

The allusion to the expression "the Nietzschean criterion" is, I think, merely internal to the present text (The Myth of Sisyphus). It is not something we the readers are supposed to know if we read this expression without having read the previous pages in The Myth of Sisyphus. And its understanding does not even require a previous familiarity with Nietzsche. So what does the expression "the Nietzschean criterion" allude to? Just a few pages before: 

No, it's not. The basic ideal of positivism, both old and new, was to purify science by eliminating from it all speculation (the positivists identified all speculation with "metaphysics", in a derogatory sense). The older kind of positivism was just more humble. It was a philosophy of science. A typical project of the old positivism was Ernst Mach's attempt to rewrite Newton's physics without assuming absolute space. With logical positivism, the stakes got raised. It was emboldened by new developments in the foundations of logic, and mathematics, which seemed to promise new and scientific foundations for language generally. And with verifiability as a criterion of meaning, not just of good science, logical positivism posited itself as a basic philosophy, not just as a philosophy of science. The logical positivists were indeed occupied with logic, that is inductive logic, the logic of discovery, empirical verification and probability. 

3 seems to me a mistaken reading of Aristotle's. Aristotle says that knowledge has an intrinsic value beside its practical value. So there is also the practical value, and hence a kind of use (or exploitation) of nature. Only of philosophy does Aristotle claim that it is done only for its own sake, without any practical value: 

I would not use the term "interpretation" here, because it can imply that we hold the object in thought, as it were, and then interpret it. But the sense is the very way in which we "hold" the object in thought. We do not have a reference before we have sense. I would also leave formal logic aside. Formal logic abstracts from all references, to concentrate on the form of expressions. There is no referring going on in formal logic. 

The implicitness that Brandom talks about is implicitness (embeddedness) in bare practice. His idea is that the more basic knowledge is just how to do something. The more advanced knowledge is how to symbolically express what we do. When we achieve that advanced knowledge, what was first implicit in practice, in bare activity, become explicit in that it can be talked about, and reasoned about. For example, a person may be reasonable, logical, without having any acquaintance with logic. This is the level of bare practice. If that person later learns logic, she will learn how to express in the logical vocabulary what was formerly implicit in her bare actions. The knowledge of logic, in turn, will provide her with additional tools to check for logical validity, when her spontaneous (implicit) logical inclinations might falter.

The answer depends (1) on the requirements that one sets on the definition (of truth), and (2) on one's preferred (informal) concept of truth. Tarski posed two requirements on the definition of truth, "material" adequacy and "formal" adequacy. Material adequacy is about the extension of the truth predicate. Truth for all the correct sentences, and only for the correct sentences, should be entailed by the definition of truth. It is here that Schema T, which is Tarski's formalization of Aristotle's definition of truth, is invoked. 

Roughly speaking,  particular = individual = singular    (opposed to universal) One is a more encompassing term (a particular is one, a universal is also one).  many = multiple (opposed to one) General pertains to a distinction between universals: general vs specific (genus vs species). A universal is more specific, less general, to the extent that it is more detailed, and closer to the particulars. So, humanity is a more specific term than animality. Animality is, then, a more general term than humanity.  

According to Hume, ideas are not merely reducible to impressions. Ideas are impressions, weakened stored impressions. Or at most ideas are impressions that were cut and pasted, like an idea of a winged horse, which is pasted from an impression of a horse and an impression of wings. There seems to be, however, a curious exception when it comes to ideas of relations. Relations, in general, are not perceived. There are, in general, no impressions of relations, according to Hume. But we do seem to have ideas of relations. These ideas of relations do not stem from impressions of relations. Instead, they stem from mental acts of comparison between (non-relational) impressions, or ideas. For example, we have ideas of different shades of colors. These come from impressions. We also have the idea that one shade is darker than another. This 'darker' idea does not come from a 'darker' impression. It comes from a mental act of comparison between colorful ideas. 

I think it will be well to distinguish between (a) qualitative experience, (b) qualia, and (c) the given. I doubt that anyone denies qualitative experience. Sellars, anyway, did not. It seems to be a pre- philosophical fact, not a matter of controversy. In “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man” (PSIM) Sellars contrasts the scientific world image with the "manifest" world image, which includes qualitative experience. Sellars's emphasis in that work is to reconcile the two "world images", to give a place to each, within a single "synoptic" world image. 'Qualia' is a metaphysical term. Qualitative experience is explained by positing non- physical entities: the qualia. Sellars does not acknowledge qualia. In both Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind (EPM) and PSIM Sellars puts it by arguing that only science, not sense experience, is sovereign to decide what exists and what does not exist. And since present science is materialistic, there is no place for non- material entities like qualia. Here is how Sellars formulates that principle in EPM, paraphrasing Protagoras: 

Putnam has always presented himself as a realist. He has been criticizing one brand of realism ("metaphysical" realism) and defending another brand of realism ("internal" realism). Roughly speaking, "metaphysical" realism is the position that language connects to the world simply by correspondence. Singular terms correspond to objects in the world. And this correspondence relations are supposed to be logically independent of our knowledge, and of our extra-linguistic practices in general. "Internal" realism is the position that the linguistic reference to objects is dependent upon our extra-linguistic practices (such as looking at objects, pointing to them, touching them, etc). Internal realism has the additional consequence that the external "objects" themselves are, in part, constituted by our practices. Reality is not "sliced" in advance into distinct objects (reality is not "ready-made", as Putnam puts it). The "slicing" of reality into objects is partly dependent on us. The slicing is still, however, objective and inter-subjective. Anyone that comes within the same net of practices is supposed to "see" the same objects. Putnam's distinction between brands of realism is Kantian in kind. It is similar to Kant's distinction between the unknowable things "in themselves", and the knowable objects, those that fall within the subjective conditions of experience, and are constituted in part by those same conditions. Kant is usually called an idealist. But, as is known, he presented himself as both an idealist and a realist, a "transcendental" idealist and an "empirical" realist. Putnam is, similarly, an advocate of a restricted kind of realism. Putnam is, then, not skeptical about reference to objects in general, just about a certain conception of that reference. He conceives the "inscrutability of reference" arguments as holding against metaphysical realism, but not against internal realism. (As to Kripke's position in this matter, I cannot say) 

It is by this, I think, that Hume "sneaks in" apriori knowledge, as in arithmetic. No apriori knowledge could come directly from impressions. But apprently we are able to "discover" apriori knowledge when we compare impressions to extract ideas of relations. 

A continuous stream of sensory input, including of one's own movements. A set of concepts and models A set of schemes, methods and principles, pertaining to how to apply the concepts and models to the sensory stream. These involve pattern matching: patterns are observed within the sensory stream, and are being translated into concepts. 

If a universal skeptic really needed to claim something, she would indeed be opening her stance to self contradiction. However, a universal skeptic need not claim anything, much less "boldly claim certainty in the knowledge that knowledge is impossible". The skeptic is characterized by disbelieving, not by believing or claiming anything. She need not claim anything, not even that knowledge is impossible. Jill does not need to claim anything, in order to cast doubts on Jack's claims. Jill just needs to show that Jack's justifications, for his claims, are flawed, by Jack's own standards. Therefore, universal skepticism need not be self defeating. 

seems highly general, it refers to everyone without restrictions. But it is not universal, because it refers to a particular person (Miranda). The choice of the words "everyone" and "anybody" is irrelevant to the present distinction. We could have switched them. 

The status of Newcomb's scenario is a matter of controversy. However, it does seem that either (1) free will is illusory, or that (2) Newcomb's scenario is itself paradoxical. Newcomb's scenario involves a "predictor" i.e. a kind of "prophet" who is (nearly) infallible in his predictions. If this ingredient is even coherent, if a "predictor" is even a possibility, it implies that the future is determined in advance. For the predictor could not tell the future, unless there was a (pre-determined) future to be told. 

From the context in What is Freedom we can see, that by the obscurity of freedom Arendt is meaning that the ocurrence of freedom cannot be proved -or disproved- empirically, that is through observation. In addition, she is endorsing two further theses of Kant on freedom. First, that freedom cannot be ascertained by subjective "inner" experience, not just by "outer" sense experience. Second, that if we ignore the inherent limitations of our ability to know, we must end up in logical contradiction - antinomy - because then both freedom and its opposite, determinism, can be proved to be the case. 

"Speculative thinking" has two main senses in modern philosophy, one from Kant, the other from Hegel. Kant uses the expression "speculative thinking" in a negative sense. It is the metaphysical thinking that pretends to know facts beyond the realm of possible experience. He refers by it to the likes of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz. 

On the other hand, Socrates asserts in the Protagoras, that no person does evil except out of ignorance. So that no person is inherently evil: 

In the "dialectic" part of CPR, Kant tries to show how, on the theoretical side (as opposed to the practical side) reason's high hopes are doomed to be frustrated. Our attempts to know about God, about whether the world was created or not, and other big questions, could never be satisfied. On the positive side, reason can guide our researches in the domains that we can know, and reason can guide us in ethics, the practical domain. And it is reason itself that reflects on itself and is bound to get to those conclusions. So when Kant defines philosophy as "the science of the relation of all knowledge to the essential ends of human reason" he alludes, I think, to the above mentioned two ends of human reason: completeness of knowledge, and knowledge of the unconditioned. It is these two aims, their fulfillments and their frustrations that, according to Kant, it is up to philosophy to investigate.
