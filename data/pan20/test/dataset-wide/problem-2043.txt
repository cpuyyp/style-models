The part about keeping you for future reference is just standard HR blah blah. They will always say that whether they mean it or not. There is no upside in telling a candidate to "Go away, we never want to see you again". Instead, it's better to say "Not now, but something might come up" regardless of how unlikely that is. This line is therefore content-free and you can't read anything into it. They will keep your information on file (probably marked with "thinks he's worth more than he is"), but don't expect them to actually do anything with it. If reason #2 above applies, then maybe if the situation changes, but still very unlikely. 

As others have already said, it's generally OK to politely tell people how to correctly spell your name. Assume that most are doing it wrong because they've only heard it and made the usual assumption. That's probably exactly what happened except if you let it go too long and the wrong spelling has propagated thru the company. Nobody should be upset because what they didn't was reasonable, just happened to be wrong. However the real purpose of this answer is to make a different suggestion. Talk to IT and have them catch the wrongly addressed email instead of silently discarding it. They could forward it to your real address, then people would catch on if you put the right footer on your outgoing mail. Or, they could bounce it with a message saying that kelly.lee@magacorp.com isn't a valid address, did you maybe mean kelli.lee@megacorp.com? 

Flexibility I think it's important to convey to your boss that you are 100% flexible, should he/she need to change this arrangement in the future, either temporarily or permanently. Employers like to know that you're willing to go out of your way, putting your personal life and preferences aside temporarily, when required for the good of the business. Of your workplace has in-office meetings, I'd suggest doing your best to attend most or all of those in person, because it's a lot easier to communicate with people you don't know in person, plus you don't want to turn into "that faceless person that was in the office that one day and sends us emails all the time." 

Career Limiting? I think it doesn't have to be career limiting to work from home, but there are situations where it could be. As mentioned above, I believe interaction with coworkers is extremely important. As mentioned above, you don't want to be "that faceless guy" because some coworkers will have no problem speaking negatively (or "gossiping") about someone they don't even know. Make sure to participate in group activities others setup like lottery pool, charity collections, birthday cards etc. Setup a Secret Santa exchange during the holidays. Occasional staff party's are also extremely important to attend (for career reasons first, and then second for de-stressing). 

I'll address the part about paying a 1/(N bodies) share of the total when you had a lot less than others. I sometimes find myself in these situations. Somebody takes the bill, adds a tip, divides by the number of people, then announces that's what everyone owes. Usually money is thrown in a big pile. Instead of tossing in the computed amount, say "I only had a salad and no drinks. Here is my share with a tip.", and toss in what you legitimately owe. Round up to the nearest $5 or whatever if you feel generous and want to make it clear you're holding up your obligation. Personally, I've never had a problem with this. People will see that you paid your way and maybe a little more, and nobody will be upset. They may need to recompute how much everyone else owes, but that's their problem. Most of the time they didn't even notice or stop to think that asking you to pay the same for your salad as their steak and a glass of wine is unfair. They're not doing it to rip you off, just hadn't thought about it and were doing the logistically easy thing. Do NOT ask for a separate bill. That makes you look like a weenie and emphasizes how you're not really part of the group. Especially if you're coming along for the social aspect, this is a bad idea. 

Cheese I've never heard the expression you used, , but I disagree with it both literally and figuratively. Given the choice between putting "expensive cheese" or "aerosol cheese", and knowing that either will catch the same number of mice, I would go cheap (unless I was planning on eating the mouse afterwards). From the company owner's point of view, what would be Perfect? He/she would probably prefer it if his employees were happy and highly productive with little-to-no interaction from him/her, zero inter-employee conflict, deadlines being met, while always being aware of current status of all projects, and (most importantly) easy profit. 

Physical setup of your home office will affect productivity as well. There are a ton of resources online to give you ideas, including this article from Forbes (and more "fluffy" articles like how to create a Zen office on a budget). 

Do It! At the end of the day, the owner wants a company that can "run itself," not just to the bare minimum, but that can flourish even without the boss's interaction. The fact that you were given a "Lead" title implies that the owner doesn't want to have to deal with day-to-day stuff. That's your job. If handled properly, working from home could be an excellent arrangement that will benefit the company, and more importantly for your own well-being and job satisfaction. Good luck! Be sure to let us know what you decide to do and how it turn out! 

Get over it. They guy talking to his wife probably didn't like the interruption any more than you did. Stuff happens. Sometimes you get interrupted, whether you happen to be interviewing someone or not. The guy in the group interview clearly didn't want to be there. He probably thought the whole thing was a waste of his time, but was told he had to be there anyway. This most likely has nothing to do with you, so getting insulted by it is just immature. He may have been in the middle of something and resented the mandatory interruption, thinks they don't need a new person in that role, thinks his opinion isn't going to count later anyway, or just really dislikes interviewing people. The others still gave you a interview, and the boss wouldn't have schedule everyone's time to talk to you if he didn't think it was important, so there is really no reason to feel insulted. Again, get over it. 

You can always choose to leave at any time, although seeing as your 6 months of internship are almost up, it would be best to stay until the time originally agreed (although you are not obligated to do so). It seems you got good value out of your internship. The purpose is for you to learn something about your field and how it works in the real world, and the company gets some low level slave labor and pre-screening of a possible junior employee. You've learned you don't like QA, and they got the slave labor and a look at you. You don't own them anything, and they don't owe you anything beyond of course paying you for whatever time you spent working there. During any internship, you should be seriously looking at all your employment options. That of course includes the company you are interning at, but should never be limited just to that. You've been negligent in looking at other options, so you need to get on that right away and seriously. You really should have your next job lined up a month before your internship ends. This is whether that next job is at the company you're currently at or not. Get your resume out there! Now! You've already waited too long. 

By all indications, the remainder of your interview went appropriately, and you don't mention it being ended prematurely, so in that case chances are the argument was not egregious enough to warrant immediate dismissal. So, here's the advice I'll give you based on typical responses to interviewing: 

A side note: I've worked for two huge retailers here in the United States (think several dozen $bn in revenue annually), and both of them had a strict "no theft" policy. If a person were terminated from any store, distribution center or even office of either company (for theft, financial violations, privacy violations, etc.) you were permanently blacklisted from the company, everywhere, within hours. One of the portions of IT companies don't skimp on is finding proper employees. My advice to you is to let it go, and forget you ever worked there. 

Depending on the local legality (in the U.S. this is entirely illegal AFAIK, but IANAL), you can fire the employee. This is probably the worst possible decision to make, as you'll probably have to give them a nice severance package to make sure they don't tell the world that you fired them for believing in _____, which would damage your companies reputation so badly I'd be surprised if you didn't become the next Theranos. Discuss this with the employee. Assuming this is a project where there is some sort of crediting / accreditation, consider the option of either obfuscating (via a pen-name, etc.) or entirely removing credit to the employee to "avoid a potential negative public response." Depending on the project, scope, and employee, this may actually work out really, really well. You can keep the employee recused from the public (mostly), and still retain good relations. Scrap the project. This is probably the second worst possible decision. I put this above firing the employee in acceptability because this will help preserve some of your reputation, depending on the "reason" you scrapped it. At least you can make something up that helps preserve your public image. If you have a different, non-special-organization project, consider swapping the designers / employees. This gives you the best of both worlds: you can be truthful about who was the designer on the project, and you can avoid the potential negative public image of having an employee whose "views" (I quoted it because you don't say, and I assume you don't even know if the employee worked on previous project because of their views: you're speculating) don't align with the project. Fire-fight. Wait until release to see what happens. It may be the case that no one really cares, or they may care. Handle it like many other organizations and just do it and fight whatever fires may arise. Chances are very few people will look up the designer, find that they supported ____, and start a riot against your company for that. 

Consider Carefully Nobody here can tell you exactly what you should do in this case because there are many variables to consider, and nobody else knows the dynamics of your particular company or employees. Being a new company, you might be better off to work in-office for the first few weeks and then change to a home position. Both your team and the boss will see this as an obvious indication of your priority. If the boss has to manage your team when you're not in-office, then you're not doing your job properly and need to get more involved immediately. If the boss wanted to go to Hawaii for a week, would the company "fall apart" or could you manage things yourself? Make yourself available to the boss and your team by phone, at any hour. If you're making up your own schedule then others shouldn't have to work around it. If you decide to work from home but ever get the impression that others feel that you're inaccessible then something needs to change immediately. 

It's BETTER than "OK"! I was once in a similar position and I believe that you should jump at the opportunity to work from home as it will be beneficial and rewarding for both yourself and for the company. Since I'm basing my opinion on *my own experience( with, here's a little background: 

This is, of course, assuming you are representing the situation correctly. You can't fix problem #1. There is a slight chance that you can address problem #2. This slight chance is if the boss for some reasons simply isn't aware of what is going on. Go to the boss, and tell him of the problems you see and why they are bad for the company. That will likely fail because the boss already knows of the issue and isn't competent to address it, or knows so little about software and managing software engineers that he isn't even competent to understand the issue. The only real solution is to start by fixing problem #2, which you can at best play a minor role in. The incompetent manager needs to be replaced. The new manager then has a sit-down with this programmer, has him explain the architecture, and tells him to stop any new development and document all the protocols. In the mean time, he gets a new engineer in that is there to "help" the first engineer with documenting the protocols, putting the software into source control, and making sure the code itself is well documented. This new engineer does any new development, and hopefully bug fixes and minor enhancements of existing software. The first engineer won't like this. He may quit, throw a tantrum, object noisily, or worse, sabotage things. This is why doing a backup is the first order of business. It would be nice to have a smooth transition from the first to the second engineer, but don't expect that to happen. The plan is to eventually fire the first engineer, if he doesn't quit or turn (even more) destructive against the company first. You simply can't let this nonsense go on. The longer you do, the more painful it is to eventually fix it. Not fixing it because it will already be painful is absolutely the wrong way to think about this. In this case I was using the rhetorical "you". To answer the question what you personally can do, start by taking your concerns to the boss, as I said above. Again, that is unlikely to result in anything useful. The next step depends on things you haven't told us. It can be very dangerous to go over your boss' head. If so, then there is little else you can do other than evaluate whether you really want to continue working there. If this is a small enough company where you can comfortably talk to higher management, then go ahead. It is quite possible that higher management already has a feeling that the low level software manager is incompetent, but of course they're not going to tell you that. This might be the additional info for them to take more decisive action. Another distant possibility, if your primary objective is to get this mess fixed and you see yourself a long-termer at this place, is to offer to take on some of the internal tool development yourself. That should give you legitimate reason to talk to the first engineer, understand how things work, where the code lives, etc. Eventually, you'd be the tools guy and management can get rid of the first engineer. Then you can ask them to hire someone for that role so that you can transition back to what you want to do. Again, this isn't something I'm seriously suggesting, but is a alternative if you really want to and are willing. 

Perhaps include a simple graphical past/current/future list of milestones (ie., a project timeline like this) that the boss will understand with a glance, and will keep in the back of his/her head as your current status. 

Many people choose Monday mornings for this kind of meeting, but research shows show that that's a bad idea. 

Remember, Taking breaks is still important even when at home, but will be more refreshing because you might have a better, more nutritious meal (than you would have had from the work microwave), have a nap, jump in the hot tub, go flirt with your neighbour, etc. See this formula for perfect productivity. 

Productivity As you stated, at home you are more comfortable and can set things up exactly how you want them. Ambience (like music, temperature, lighting) are your preference (without the boss having to worry about finding a "happy medium" to satisfy everyone.) emphasized text It's no secret that "a happy worker is a productive work". (Actually, studies show that there are other emotions more important to productivity, but happiness is important too!) Since you are new, and you are the Lead, I would recommend that you setup regular in-office meetings every 1 or 2 weeks (but no longer). *As an example, perhaps... 

You also need to research more projects this employee worked on. Have they been on 25 different projects, excluding yours? If so, then it really isn't a big deal that one of the projects was for _____, which didn't fall in line with your particular beliefs. I've worked on literally dozens of projects, and the scope of the "beliefs" of each project range so far across the medium that it's not even funny any more. Try not to be a bigot in this case. In the end, it all boils down to which role you want to play. Who do you want to support? Yourself? Your "company"? (are you, in-fact, in control of the company?) The public? Your employee? Personally, professionally, ethically and morally, I would select either option 2 or 4. Chances are, if the employee is passionate about helping people, they'll agree to one or the other. Most people are understanding about these things, and it seems a lot of issues on this site boil down to "poor communication", such as this situation. You're literally asking Internet strangers to tell you how to resolve an issue behind the back of someone who has done no wrong. That's the worst kind of disrespect. Treat your employee with the same respect they have treated you, and it sounds like they have been very respectful.
