OK. I think maybe this answer describes a beginning to the Mahayana. For what it's worth I understand the vow (quoted above) to mean, not "making a self enlightened", but "acting in an unselfish (and unlimited) way" ... as well as "accomplishing" the path (which, "accomplishing the path", may be an ideal that's described in the suttas too). 

I guess that "founded on desire" might refer to what is called "Right intention" or "right aspiration" or "the exertion of our own will to change"; although it (i.e. the second of the eightfold path) is also translated as 'Right Resolve'. Also, "fabrications of exertion" is Right effort, etc. Given that explanation, the Brahman says that seems like a contradiction, 

The Buddha could see his (and other people's) past existences, so the question ("how did it all begin?") was likely to arise (and people, maybe your physicists for example, still ask themselves that to this day). But this ("How did the world begin? Did the world begin?") belongs to the category of unanswered questions. When I was young I used to fight with my brother, and when my mum would come then we'd say, "He started it!" -- "No, he started it!", and she'd tell us, "It doesn't matter who started it, you both have to stop." See also "a thicket of views" on this page which helps to explain why unanswered questions are unanswered. See also for example the first few lines of the Dhammapada (including this verse), which suggest it doesn't matter whether you have a reason for fighting, what matters is whether you hold (attach to) that view. Anyway, saying that the beginning is "inconstruable" is a way of answering (or not answering) the question, of closing that line of investigation. The decision of what to investigate, of what to teach as dhamma, is a question of soteriology (see also "Simsapa Sutta: The Simsapa Leaves (SN 56.31)"). 

Printed/published books like that (i.e. a reasonably concise set of canonical texts) certainly exist. For example there was one (titled "The life and sayings of the Buddha" or something like that) in my hotel room in Singapore, next to (i.e. as well as) a Christian bible (and, if I recall correctly, a Hindu bible and a Muslim bible). Admittedly it's a set of canonical texts, not a canonical set of texts. 

I think I remember reading, sometime in the distant past, than when someone asked the Buddha about the afterlife, he replied "I'm not here to talk to you about the afterlife: I'm here to talk to you about this life." Is it OK to believe, is it OK to say that a belief in rebirth isn't important to Buddhism? Not a big part of the historical Buddha's teaching? That when he mentioned it at all, it was to say that it didn't exist ("anatta" and "anicca"), that he didn't expect to be doing it himself, and that it wasn't worth talking about? And/or is it a non-core part of Buddhism: something which some Buddhists believe and other Buddhists don't, a local/cultural viewpoint? The article Two Main Schools of Buddhism says, 

Addictions are difficult to understand. I guess I'd define an addiction as being an activity (or substance) which gives you some kind of pleasure when you do it, and which you therefore do repeatedly, even though the activity isn't helpful or useful. So I suppose examples of these might include: 

A correct or truthful, beneficial, description of the world and its processes Noble, or ariya Better than other people or beliefs 

You phrased that as a personal/practical question, but here's a theoretical or terminological answer. "Persistence" is listed as one of the Five Strengths but also one the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. In the latter article, in the table named "Balancing enlightenment factors & hindrances", it's grouped with other factors ... 

There's a Wikipedia article, Yana (Buddhism), which introduces the term Yana and various historical origins/usages of this word. I think of "Mahayana" as identifying schools of Buddhism which passed through China (so, Japan as well). Or if "China" isn't a fair way to summarize it in one word (it's more related to the Geography and/or the History of Buddhism than the practice or the teaching of Buddhism), maybe think of it as Bodhisattvayāna. "Vajrayana" is I think Tibetan: historically Tibetan were able to adopt (or be influenced by) Buddhism from India or China, see for example Moheyan. Some people (rightly or wrongly) consider "Hinayana" to be rude or belittling, and use the term "Theravada" instead (other people, who use the term "Hinayana", say that it isn't used to refer to Theravada at all). But anyway, Theravada rather than Hinayana is the name of one of the two (or three) biggest classifications/sects. There are many ways to classify schools, see e.g. Schools of Buddhism. I don't know "what was the necessity of creating these 'Yanas'". Actually someone on this site wrote that the term "Buddhism" is questionable, that -ism is a Western or English-language construct; I suppose they mean it's better to use words like Dhamma or Dharma and so on. 

There might be something along those lines in SN 4.23 Godhika Sutta. Page 85 of The Patimokkha Rules Translated & Explained says, 

I hope you don't mind a personal story. Perhaps my earliest introduction to any Buddhism would have been my dad reading to me Kim (a novel set in late 19th century India, in which a boy becomes friends and travels with a Tibetan Lama). The other characters are colourful, many of them working for the British secret service and acting against the Russians in Afghanistan. One is a Muslim horse trader. The Lama (an abbot who has come to India on a pilgrimage) is oblivious to such goings-on, but stops to explain the wheel of life and so on to people if they ask. Anyway, towards the end and after the action is over, there's a conversation while other sleep between the Lama and the horse trader (who also works as a spy and who leads a complicated life). The contrast and conversation between the two characters is comedy. Anyway, a fragment of that conversation I've always remembered: 

I really do mean to ask, how do you deal with the two concrete situations given above? I am inclined to "yield first", although it doesn't often (or hardly ever) happen in practice that I'm walking on a path that narrow. When I'm on a bicycle on a shared footpath, pedestrians are usually inclined to yield to me, and then I allow them to yield (they walk on one side of the path and I cycle past them); or you could say I yield i.e. I cycle around them. I slow, slow to a stop, or dismount when necessary (e.g. on a single-lane footpath under a bridge, when passing small children or off-leash dogs, or on a pedestrian side-walk). Sometimes I drive a car on a single-track road. There is a (unwritten?) convention for which car is supposed to yield in that case, i.e. it's supposed to be whichever car is able to yield the most easily: 

I think you're supposed to stay aware instead of daydreaming when you're driving. Try moving your eyes repeatedly to look at different things: ahead, behind, the traffic lights, the other cars, pedestrians on this or that side who might be about to step into the road, etc. Also breath enough to stay alert. And think about what someone might do unexpectedly, don't assume they've seen you until they prove it. I think it's OK to react to changing road and bike conditions without too much conscious thought, but in order to react (even to react automatically) you need to retain awareness of what's happening around you, you need to have seen it, you need to have been paying attention. When there's an accident it's usually someone else's fault (e.g. a car turning into your right of way because they weren't paying attention and stupidly didn't notice you), but even though it's their fault there's often something you could/should have done to avoid it. For example a common type of motorbike accident is where you come up to a green light, ride through the intersection, and a car coming in the other direction turns across your path (so it's the car's fault), but the motorcycle doesn't even brake before hitting the car (so apparently the rider wasn't paying much attention either). Also it's not just about you. When I'm on a bicycle I'm fairly harmless and I'm looking out for my own safety; when I'm driving a car I'm fairly well protected but conscious that unless I'm always careful I could really hurt someone else, and that it's my responsibility to never drive where I'm not looking. 

Beware that I'm reading this from a book: I don't know Tibetan Buddhism (and Wikipedia's article on Tibetan Buddhism suggests that it requires a teacher, an "authentic lineage of transmission" from "a lama who is fully qualified to give it"). The footnotes (on page 379) reference the Visuddhimagga. 

A book titled In the Buddha's words is "An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon" by Bhikkhu Bodhi. You can find it online as a PDF. Its second chapter (only 25 pages) is titled "The Bringer of Light" and is a biography: it has section titles like, "The Buddha's Conception and Birth", "The Decision to Teach", and "The First Discourse". Its advantage is that it's quoting suttas, so I guess that's "widely read" and reportedly autobiography. 

There are other answers to this question, saying "Yes, in all cases" and "benefit is known to occur on a case-by-case basis" -- I'd like to agree with both. There's a wide range of "poor mental health" and "mental illness". In some of the more extreme conditions you might not understand people, see them as a devil, not be able to pay attention because of the voices in your head, and so on. I'm told that sometimes people need psychiatric medication first, before they can make sense of conversation ... but that (medication) isn't enough, what comes after that? The following are several ways in which I think it could help. 

Where is this actually stated in the canonical scripture? After only a quick search I don't find many references other than the two you already mentioned (assuming you're only looking for suttas and not for example the Visuddhimagga). There's another here: The Nibbāna-element. There's also (the famous) Dhamapada verse 154 (which says visaṅ­khā­ra­ rather than asaṅkhata). But this mean that even the cessation of suffering Nibanna itself is conditional! Yes I think that's so: that cessation (i.e. transition from suffering to non-suffering) is conditional ... it's conditional on the removal of the fuel of suffering. I think the understanding is that, after the condition for suffering have been removed, then the non-suffering (i.e. the non-arising of further suffering) is unconditioned. For example if you look at an empty fireplace (empty of fuel), then I think you can say "that fire is never going to light again there ... because there is no fuel." You could bring more fuel, I suppose (so you could say it's conditional on the not-bringing of more fuel), but apparently an Arhat has learned better than to want to do that (and I think might even be unable to do that: unable to see the non-desirable as desirable, for example) As you say, though, maybe it's not an especially important assertion, and is metaphysical. I think that there other places where "following the path" is given as a condition for arriving; but that, having arrived, those conditions no longer applicable; for example: 

What does Buddha teach about how to live well while suffering? There's a book The Buddha's Teachings on Prosperity: At Home, At Work, in the World -- which introduces the suttas, but categorizes them and picks the ones which are especially intended for people in lay society. The emphasis is more on living well than on suffering. The author is Theravada (as are the suttas that are referenced in the book), rather than Tibetan, though. If you want some more specifically Gelug teachings you might consider His Holiness the Dalai Lama's many books. Or ask another question about that on this site (i.e. to ask for book recommendations). 

I tried to understand (classical) Buddhist doctrine even though I have modern preconceptions (from a "modern scientific" education). Generally IMO "modern science" and "Buddhism" are different topics: e.g. modern science provides models for the phenomena you observe through a microscope or telescope, which IMO is not at all what Buddhism is trying to teach. IMO the fact that Buddhist doctrine is translated using modern words (including e.g. "elements"), which are also associated with modern doctrines (e.g. "the periodic table"), is a potential source of confusion (in the student who uses these words), but shouldn't be understood as proof that the topics (Buddhism and science) are the same topic (e.g. that they're both attempting to solve the same problem or describe the same phenomenal observations). Thus IMO a lot of problems are avoided by not accepting the premise which you granted (i.e. that we should "assume modern scientific discoveries contradict or alter the Buddha's explanations"). For example, let's imagine that you and I were having an argument: where you were saying one thing and I was saying another. I think I should assume that you're trying to say something, that "means something" (or "is true") to you. The question is, what's Buddhism trying to say, what's it getting at, and why, what does it see that I don't, where's it coming from, what can I learn from it? Some other problems can be avoided by understanding some of the doctrine as metaphorical: expressed using the language (including the "scientific" models) of the time. Some people say that some small parts of it (e.g. a sutta which includes a cosmological model, and a description of the evolution of the human species) is a parody of contemporary models. That's a theory. Personally if something doesn't make sense to me then I'm inclined to leave it and look for something which does make sense (or makes more sense). Within that sutta, for example, as in many other Buddhist stories, I'd ask "what's the moral of the story, what lesson is it trying to teach?" I am (personal history) accustomed to literature that uses or consists of parables, which uses talking animals as characters for example to teach the reader something about life. I don't want to say that Buddhism is a fable, or shouldn't be taken literally, because I think it's often carefully expressed and well-expounded (and purposeful). But there may be something of a mix in the canon, see for example ... 

I'm not sure whether to say it is a Buddhist tradition or whether it's from a Buddhist tradition. Here's what they write about their organization: 

According to the Wikipedia article Four Dharma Seals, some schools of Buddhism teach "Three Dharma Seals" as including Nirvana but excluding Dukkha (for example Google finds The Three Dharma Seals by Thich Nhat Hanh) because "suffering is not an inherent aspect of existence". 

This page (probably the whole web site) is mostly about Tibetan Buddhism. It also links to Zen teachers issue open letter confronting abuse from which you can read about some similar problems within Western Zen. I hope you will not need such information. 

To relate that to intention, I'd say that "Putting oneself in the place of another" is a view, and that the consequence of that view is the "intention" to be harmless (and, consequently, harmless actions). Also I think that "harmlessness" and "good-will" are closely related, two sides of the same coin. I can barely tell them apart. Also you say it's "not a motivation" but I think that's a motive of all ethics (sila): 

I don't think that "no specific goal" is true of medicine, for example. If I go to my doctor with any complaint (for example, a complaint about my shoulder), then there is a specific goal. Similarly I suspect that Buddhism has a specific goal: its goal is the third noble truth i.e. cessation. 

The last paragraph ("she is 50yo. She had 3x stroke") reminds me of the first few verses from the Dhammapada: 

Hearing the voice as a voice is distracting -- some people (perhaps with a weaker understanding of reality) find it alarming or confusing -- see e.g. Auditory hallucination. My very limited experience is that you're warned that you shouldn't necessarily do something just because you hear a voice telling you to! That it isn't the Voice of God, or anything. 

Expectations There's a bit of advice in this answer about what to look for in a marriage partner. If I may say so I think I might interpret the subject of "needs" a little differently than Dhammadhatu does. One of the foundational virtues is "generosity" (i.e. giving), which might be seen as almost the opposite of being "needy". I expect young children (infants) to be "needy", I kind of expect adults to be the opposite of needy, i.e. generous and independent. 

I mostly agree with Dhammadhatu's answer. And, so far as I know, modern Western psychology too doesn't necessarily agree with "catharthis" (popularized by Freud as a treatment for "hysteria") -- it may be that activity like screaming doesn't especially release anger, but may instead accustom/train/reward you for screaming. You ask about "other traditions aside from Theravada", and I don't know, but the only thing I can think of that seems to me even vaguely related to catharsis are statements or attitudes associated with overcoming taboos: statements like, "If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him"; or warnings against "the stink of Zen". See also this answer as an example; though according to this comment I guess that's more to do with abandoning than embracing. Or this answer on "attachments as obstacles to enlightenment".
