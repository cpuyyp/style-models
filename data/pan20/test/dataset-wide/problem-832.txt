These images are very high quality, and the last one, dated (08-June-2004) appears to be taken at/near inferior conjunction, when Venus is almost directly between the observer and the Sun. Question: I'd like to understand with what instrument this image was taken, and how the technical challenges imaging Venus with such a small angular separation between it and the Sun were overcome! I did a quick check and during the UTC day of June 8th, 2004, Venus moved from about 0.6 to 1.1 degrees from the Sun as viewed by Earth. How was Venus imaged so nicely? Was this really imaged from the ground through Earth's daytime atmosphere, or from space? In either case, how was a high quality telescope pointed so close to the Sun and shielded from stray light and protected from damage? 

From the linked question: People have fanned out over South America and South Africa with telescopes with cameras and GPS clocks and have attempted to watch the shadow of a roughly magnitude +13 star cast by a rock in the KUIPER BELT pass over the Earth! Early Twitter reports reported clear skies and images of the Omega Centauri star cluster. There is a Twitter hash tag for these events, #mu69occ. Here is a 500 millisecond exposure from a few days before the occultation. The short exposure time is necessary to resolve small scale debris from the main occultation. 

What is a quaternary mirror Why does the E-ELT need one What is it about this mirror that is "very complex"? 

The values $$\alpha_0 = 0.00 - 0.641 T$$ $$\delta_0 = 90.00 - 0.557 T$$ provide a first-order estimate of the movement of the right ascension ($\alpha_0$) and declination ($\delta_0$) of the direction of the Earth's north pole for short periods of time after the epoch, expressed to three digits of precision only. $T$ represents the time after epoch expressed in units of Julian centuries (36525 days). The centuries unit was chosen to make the values of order unity, not because the values are meant to be used to extrapolate for centuries. You should be thinking of using this for a period of years, until the next update is published. This is because the motion sets off in that direction, but will move in approximately a circle about the pole of the ecliptic, and in about 26,000 years return to roughly the same direction. Watch Steven Senders' snappy video. 

For very simple cases of one, or maybe two planets with minimal interplanetary gravitational interaction, a Fourier transform of a nice, long, continuous radial velocity measurement would show two main peaks, and possibly other artifacts. If the stellar motion induced by each planet were similar magnitude, the analysis might be fairly simple. But for the six planet case mentioned in the quote (I don't know which one it is), and patchy time coverage (it's a survey) how was this analysis done? Peaks alone? Or just throw it to a supercomputer simulation of every possible combination and let simulated annealing run for a month? Or was there some 'detective work' involved as well - assumptions, limitations of the fitting space, or even inclusion of other data from outside the study? 

Asking what they would do if they existed and if they had capabilities is really the realm of science fiction. There can be no good answer to your question at this time. Maybe later we'll know, maybe never. 

Probably not. You'd need a could of gas dense enough to contract under its own gravity. In the space between galaxies, matter is spread too thin for a solar-system sized cloud to exist. A much larger cloud could be more diffuse and still collapse, but being much larger, it would collapse into a galaxy. Even within a galaxy, stars seem to form when shock waves from nova or some other event initiates the gravitational collapse. 

An object hitting the Earth at high speed has a lot of kinetic energy, \begin{align} \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \end{align} where m is the object's mass and v is it's velocity. If the velocity goes from lots to nothing relative to the Earth, that kinetic energy has to go somewhere. That somewhere ends up as heat. 

Time does not pass slower near a black hole. Stay-Home-Sally far from a black hole observing Astro-Bob descending into a black hole would see Bob's time passing slower as Bob neared the event horizon, but Bob would not experience this. On the contrary, Bob, looking back at Sally, would see time pass faster for her as he neared the event horizon. Who is right, or is time relative to the motion of the observers? 

"Life" seems to be an emergent phenomenon, a complex result of a very large number of simple parts or interactions. The whole is more than the sum of it's parts, unpredicted by the properties of the individual parts. If those individual parts are atoms and molecules, they have to move to be able to interact, to build larger, more complex structures. To move, they need to be suspended in something that permits movement and allows chemical reactions. On Earth, that would be liquid water. Other liquids might work, but they'd need to allow for the movement and reactions life requires. It's hard to imagine something other than a liquid doing the job. 

"What happened before the Big Bang" is like asking what Alexander the Great's phone number was. It's a nonsensical question. Space and time began with the Big Bang. "When" and "where" began with the Big Bang. 

Yes. By looking at a nearby object that hasn't been subject to erosion and has been subject to the same position around the sun, you could estimate the distribution of impacts on the Earth in time and in size. The moon is excellent for this purpose. Here's an article touching on the subject: $URL$ 

Of course the newly announced SDSS-III data and maps from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with 1.2 million objects, along with all previous data sets are openly available, and I'm sure there are many tools to access, work with, and view the data. What would be the simplest way to extract a list of coordinates of galaxies in order to just try to visualize it on my own? There may be visualization tools also, if you want to add a link that would be great, but this question is about getting a list of coordinates so I can look at density or even try to plot one dot per galaxy in some slice. I'm guessing the coordinates might be available in RA, dec, and redshift, and possibly also some calculated/inferred x, y, z. I use python, but I'm not familiar with AstroPy yet, so if it can be done, albeit inefficiently and/or inaccurately by my writing a straightforward python script on my laptop, that would be the most helpful answer. edit: if doing this in AstroPy is failry easy, I do have an Anaconda installation, and therefore already have at least a basic AstroPy installation. Here is a graphic (below), from here in Phys.org attributed there to Daniel Eisenstein and SDSS-III. 

Question: Were there in fact transits of the Earth as seen from Mars on these dates (in 1905, on 11-May-1984, and in 2084)? If they do occur at roughly 100 year intervals as suggested, there may in fact be people on Mars to see the next one presuming that Sir Clarke did his maths right (did he ever not?). On what day would that be? 

In this answer I have rearranged an equation from somewhere, and now I can not relocate the source. My re-aranged form is: $$M_{Abs} = 5 \left(\log_{10}(1329) -\frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(\text{albedo}) -\log_{10}(D_{km})\right)$$ This is the relationship between the absolute magnitude of an object and its diameter and albedo, assuming it is spherical. Question: What is a good source for any form of this equation to which I can link in my answer?

There are many flavors of reflecting telescopes based on the original Cassegrain design which has been attributed by history to Laurent Cassegrain: 

This is a really good question. Any attempt at a good answer requires breaking the news that in a realistic solar system with some big planets "A Keplerian orbit is merely an idealized, mathematical approximation at a particular time". If you are writing a computer program and not using ink, feathers, and parchment, it's best to just integrate the appropriate ODEs for the six element state vectors ($x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z$) of each body in question. There are several ways to do this. You can use an ephemeris to get the state vectors at one moment in time (set up initial conditions) and integrate yourself, or you can get tables of positions of everything besides your asteroid and interpolate them. Two examples of resources for these are NASA JPL's Horizons and the python package Skyfield but there are several other options. You can do some looking around here and in the Space Exploration stackexchange sites for tags for those. The sun's motion relative to the solar system's center of mass is not a simple orbit, but reflects the motion of (primarily) Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and the only way to get it right is to either calculate all of them yourself, or use a pre-calculated ephemeris. These are necessary both to get the position of the sun correctly, and to calculate the gravitational effects of those planets on your asteroid! Remember though, that gravity travels at the speed of light, so if you want to do precise calculations you have to at least make a first order approximation at each time step to where the planet would have been in the past such that the gravity "signal" will have just arrived at your asteroid at the time reflected in your time step. Here's an example of the sun's motion with python. Dashed lines represent the equatorial radius of the sun - the motion regularly moves beyond one solar radius from the solar system center of mass. 

It's hard to say without some research, but I don't think the answer really matters much. Both constellations are chance alignments that have little or nothing to do with how close the stars really are to each other. It's not hard to envision a constellation composed of a few nearby stars and a few galaxies millions of light years away. 

Kepler did know the orbital period of the Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. He had access to observations going back centuries, including Brahe's most excellent data. What couldn't know was the absolute size of the Earth's orbit, so the best he could do was give the size of the plantets' orbits in terms of the Earth-Sun distance, 1 A.U. Nobody else could do better for centuries. Using the transit of Venus across the face of the sun, timing the instant the edge of Venus "touches" the edge of the Sun from two different locations on Earth a known distance apart makes a parallax measurable, and the absolute distance between the Earth and Venus a matter of trigonometry. Kepler's Law lets us convert all the other relative distances into absolute distances. I believe it was 1769 when this was first accomplished. 

If you're big enough and fluid enough, like an atmosphere, you would feel acceleration do to the Earth's motion. Hadley cells are patterns of warm air rising in the tropics, flowing north, and sinking at higher latitudes. The Earth's rotation causes this north-south flow to curve, causing storms to have that distinctive spin you see in in hurricanes. Alternatively, if you are an exceptionally long pendulum, you'd try to oscillate in the same plane. However, the Earth's rotation would make that plane appearto rotate with respect to the surface of the Earth. Called a Foucault pendulum, it was the first proof the Earth rotates visible from the surface. 

There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object. So yes, you can be still with respect to one object, but you'll be moving with respect to every other object. As for using it as a form of travel, letting your destination come to you, well, there's no difference between that and simply moving toward your destination other than the way you phrase it. 

There are really only six ways you could heat the interior of a planet. Gravitational collapse and compression, fission, fusion, crystallization, a very large impactor, and tidal flexing. Fusion is out because Earth would be a rock-star. (Been waiting to use that one.) Of the remaining possibilities, nuclear fission explains the majority of Earth's current temperature gradient. $URL$ 

If the Earth were alone in space and the hypothetical moon had negligible mass, you can calculate the distance at which the period would be one year using: $$ a = \left( \frac{GM_E T^2} {4 \pi^2} \right)^{1/3} $$ where $GM_E$ is the standard gravitational parameter of the Earth (about 3.9860E+14 m^3/s^2) and $T$ is the period (about 365.2564 x 24 x 3600 sec). You should get about 2.2 million kilometers. It turns out that because the Earth is orbiting around the Sun, the added gravitational effect results in a location a bit closer, about 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, where a low mass object would tend to remain at the far side from the Sun of the Earth for a while. This location is one of the five Lagrangian points, and has the designator Sun-Earth L2. There is a similar point L1 between the Earth an the Sun as well. However, this is not a stable orbit, even in a perfect circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP or CRTBP) scenario, the least little displacement would cause it to eventually wander away into it's own, somewhat chaotic orbit around the Sun within a few years. The reality of the more elliptical orbits of Solar System bodies plus gravitational perturbations would only reinforce this instability. So find a way to give the hypothetical moon a propulsion system to do station keeping maneuvers to keep it there, and you've got almost what you are looking for. The problem is that this point is in the same neighborhood as the point where the Umbra of the Earth's shadow disappears. Since the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the point where the umbra terminates moves a bit, and since there is no exact definition of a Lagrange point's location for a messy, realistic Solar System, the question of whether a satellite in the vicinity of L2 would be in partial or total eclipse is debatable. If you already have the propulsion to do station keeping, you could possibly move it in to the umbra and maintain it there as well. 

Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in the context of cold solar-system bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, or Kuiper belt objects (e.g. Pluto)? Both can lead to spreading of new water across the surface, and both can result in plumes of water vapor above the surface. Do they have distinctly different mechanisms? 

As a rough analogy: imagine looking at an image full of galaxies through a rippled piece of glass. While a circular lens might make a galaxy look smaller or larger, a ridge would have a preferential direction of magnification, and the galaxies under that ridge would have a statistical tendency to have slightly different sizes on average parallel vs perpendicular to the ridge. Is such a phenomenon generally agreed to have been observed yet? Are there any plots (of any kind) that show such experimental data?
