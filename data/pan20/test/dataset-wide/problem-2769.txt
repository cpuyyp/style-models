Why does he think the premise is not needed? Does he mean it is logically straightforward or obvious to convert any invalid argument into a valid one? If so, how? 

Why do we get angry about anything? We could say that many times it is because we have personal issues related to the event or subject in question. In the case of physicists, that also may or may not apply. But in my experience, even if the above is the case, it is usually justified. People tend to distort or misinterpret physics claims in order to fit their own beliefs. Specially with modern physics, that has a lot of out-of-the-ordinary consequences, many people take a superficial view and use that as an "explanation" for spiritual stances. Ken Wilber has an audio conversation entitled "Does Quantum Physics Prove God?" in which he says that it does not, and that those claims come from misunderstandings. The interesting thing is that Wilber himself is a "spiritualist" (whatever that may mean), but he says that that kind of mix of physics and spirituality is both bad physics and bad mysticism. So when a physicist gets aggro about that, I would consider that it is because so many people has misused physics without really understanding it, simply trying to transfer some of physics knowledge's strength to the "spiritual". 

Well, as with almost everything in philosophy, it depends on the definition you use, in this case of "science". Meditation is open to falsification. If you do it and experience something that leads you to a hypothesis, I may do it and experience something that falsify your hypothesis. Notice that the fact that a phenomenological method is ontologically subjective is not the same as not being epistemologically objective. It is subjective because it is an interior experience. But it may be objective in the sense that when I do it and you do it we both share some features of the same experience. Of course, this would dismiss most mythological accounts of the experiences, and should leave only the things that are common and consistent. The problem here is when you take the empiricist part of science. Empiricism refers to experience, but in general there is a supposition of experience as only what comes through the senses. But if you take some form of radical empiricism stance, you may consider anything you experience as, well, experience. The major example in this would be mathematics. It is common to refer to math as not science, but a subarea of logic and philosophy. I don't want to go into that discussion specifically. All I wanna do is point out that math has the same issues. When you prove a math theorem, for example, what you do is an interior process that leads to an interior experience. The experience is the "aha, this proof makes sense!". Then, you go to your peers and say: check this proof. By this you are telling them the equivalent of: do the interior math process and check the interior experience to try and falsify my results. So, again, it all depends on what stance you take on "science". This is not an easy nor settled question. Personally, I think it doesn't make much sense to keep those kind of knowledge - another problematic word - so far apart. 

Whose - or what - idea is Nagel referring to when he says that skepticism about the external world is thought to have been refuted? Were those Thompson Clarke's ideas published later? Where can I read about them? I have "The Legacy of Skepticism" on queue to read, but I'll appreciate if someone gives me more specific recommendations. 

"If there's not a God then there's a human" - this is part of the cases where the truth table says that if A is false, than your implication doesn't deduce anything at all. Notice that both (A,B) = (0,1) and (0,0) are true. The value of A => B can also be seen as ~A V B, which includes: if A is false, the implication is true. "If there's a God then there's not a human" - this case is the only one false because it is the only one that doesn't allow A => B to be true. Again, it's a matter of validity, not a matter of the sense of the statements. If you define A as "there's a God" and define B as "there's a human", then when you ask for the truth values of A => B, it will be false if the case is A => ~B, i.e., "If there's a God then there's not a human". 

The only way of knowing if something can or can't be proven is thinking about it. If you simply assume a question can't be answered/proven, then in the case you're wrong, you will never know. If thinking about those questions leads to proof, great! If it doesn't, then we will have a better understanding of the reasons why it might or not be provable. If we limit too much the things we think about in philosophy, we are risking creating blindspots. Besides, even if it's "intellectual exercise", it's not a mere thing. I understand and agree that we should be aware - at least in principle - of when to expect provable answers and when to expect an abundance of speculation. But it's not a clear-cut distinction and, as you said, intellectual exercise has intrinsic value. So in the worst case, mental workout. Plus, it's fun as hell. 

I was looking at the wikipedia article on Syllogism where it describes the different types of syllogisms. I understand the usefulness of syllogism when first introducing logic, and I also understand that it is much older than set theory. But I find all those descriptions much harder to understand than if I simply think in terms of sets. I spent a few minutes trying to understand one of the types (Modus Celarent) only to realize it was obvious if you think about it using sets. So my question is the same as in the title: is there something in syllogism that is not covered by set theory? Or, more weakly, is it still useful to learn about it once you have the basic intuitions about sets? 

Keep in mind that the truth table for implication only shows you what the combination of the different values for the statements lead as a conclusion for the implication. It's about the validity of the conclusions, not about the truth of the statements. You could use "horses like bananas => microwaves are rock stars" and it wouldn't matter. You can't read the truth table as if it were saying something about the "sense" of the statement. So, that said, let's talk about the cases you have doubt: 

I think there are ways to question solipsism, but it can always be tweaked in one way or another to remain untouchable. My favorite way to question it is this: solipsism says that everything that exists is actually a subjective experience of some "I" - you can define that "I" anyway you want. The problem is that in order to do that, you need to have a distinction in place. You need to differentiate "I" from "not-I", so you can say that everything that exists is "I". Otherwise, the term "I" refers to nothing that could be distinguishable from anything else. Two cases then: 

Sometimes when I'm reading philosophy some greek terms become a problem (I'm looking at you, Heidegger), and I have to keep checking the Internet for translations and explanations. I've already searched for resources to learn Greek, but they are mostly focused on either learning the language as a whole, or learning traveling phrases. Also, they are usually about modern Greek, and I don't know how useful it would be regarding the (Ancient?) Greek used in Philosophy. I was trying to find something that, for example, focus on roots and how they combine so one can get a general understanding of terms that come up in philosophical texts. So, is there a good resource to learn basic Greek for Philosophy purposes? 

Assume they got something right. Even if it doesn't seem at first, the great philosophers are great for a reason. I'm not saying that you should value them just because they're called "great", but the fact that they are still read by very smart people is at least an indication that there is something of value in their writings. That also doesn't mean you need to read everything by everyone of them, but that you should strive to see what they got right (see below), because no single philosopher got everything right. 1.1. When you read something that bothers you as nonsense, "note down mentally" the criticism, but leave open the possibility that the writer has a point that you simply didn't see. It's very hard to criticize the whole of an author's work without knowing exactly what one is trying to convey, and it's very hard to know what that is without reading a lot from and about the person. Of course, that doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize, simply that we should be careful. Keep in mind that knowledge (in the broad sense) is built on the shoulders of the previous thinkers. I'd take a risk and say that the smartest people today are probably smarter than the smartest people of before. But one of the reasons for that is the legacy the previous people left. So, at the very least their work should be valued for that. Then you have two options (not exclusive): a. If your aim is to understand the history of ideas (or some idea), then you'll probably have to read everything. Understanding completely the ideas of a philosopher is very hard without knowing his context, the ideas he was sunk into and the ideas he was trying to fight. And that branches out very quickly. b. If your aim is exposing yourself to new ideas, then you can be more selective. It is still very useful to know a philosopher's context and surrounding ideas, but you don't have to put up with every BS they sometimes say. No, you probably won't agree with Aristotle's view on "natural slaves", but you still can benefit from his ideas on ontology. In this case I see no problem in reading contemporary writings for the sake of quality density and efficiency.
