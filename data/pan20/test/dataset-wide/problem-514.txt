All that said, most modern bars have some visible demarcations on either side of the clamp area that makes eyeballing and/or measuring to the left and right of the stem pretty easy, without all this silliness. 

You may want to considered a hybrid system that utilizes a battery store that the generator feeds into so you can work within the limitations of the hub generator, but supplement it with additional battery light(s). Generally, this sort of thing is for recharging gadgets and not necessarily running additional lights. $URL$ I'm certain there are electrical experts that could answer if the hub is just a trickle charger for a battery during daylight hours or what the limitations of such a system are based on voltage/amperage/ohms requirements for the various devices. There's also probably some concern around how the battery lights connect to the system. More of an alterative to investigate instead of a clear answer. 

Details: The front wheel repair (called "truing") should be around $20 plus another dollar or so to replace the broken spoke. While I haven't used hockey tape, others have had success with similar cloth tape as long as you're not buying extremely cheap stuff. You'll get more padding with standard synthetic handelbar tape (contains a bit of foam or synthetic cork) which starts around $8. By watching various youtube videos, you can wrap these yourself very easily. (Also, cheap cloth tape will be more messy and sticky and won't be as easy to unwrap and start over.) A reputable, friendly, quality bike shop will help you get your bike in safe, rideable shape for the least amount of money possible. Insist on the bare essentials for a safe ride, but listen to anything that they say is a true hazard. Technically, you can ride a bike frozen in a single usable gear, but a few affordable tweaks of the drivetrain and replaced cables can mean riding a bike that is much more enjoyable and capable of taking you anywhere you want to go. Given your bike and needs, a basic $50 tune up will get them to look at and repair the necessities which wouldn't include the wheel repair and handlebar tape mentioned above. Remind them you're on a budget and are going to try to do some improvements (handlebar tape) on your own. Showing this initiative sometimes helps. Be wary of anyone that steers you toward purchasing an entirely new bike. A good shop will have low-budget options and might even secretly do a few tweaks and fixes out of pride and a sense of responsibility to someone who is giving such a lovely old bike, new wings. 

It has, in fact, been implemented by other manufacturers, SRAM call their clutch-equipped derailers Type-2. As for other group sets, I take that you mean road derailers? if that is the case, road RDs do not benefit at all from this feature, as there is not rough terrain (talking about roots/ rock gardens here) or drops on the road. 

Since you need a support point for any lever you migth be trying to use to push the pistons back, doing it with the wheel on the only support point available is your rotor. That not only leaves you with too small of a gap to effectively apply pressure to the pads, but also puts your rotor at risk, like other have pointed out. JMAR answer is the only alternative, and that has its risks too, because now you need to re-align the caliper, you need to be careful to avoid damaging the brake hose, and if you are using a thread-locker you need to clean the bolts and apply it again,ã€€having to wait 24 hour for it to cure. 

It's not a terrible idea to take any bicycle wherever you want or need to go within your riding skill limits as there are unique challenges with different surfaces and obstacles. Wider tires generally allow wider applications. With proper inflation, on pavement, a wider tire will be just as fast as a skinnier tire and may even allow you to ride more efficiently, quickly and confidently through turns or when rough surfaces, cracks or potholes appear. 

Work a bit on smaller bunny hops - maybe up and down a curb - until you can start to feel yourself landing with a bit less force or until you get a sense that you are anticipating the landing. It was easier for me to yank and jump higher, but it took a while for me to learn how to jump in such a way that I was landing more gracefully and not thrashing my bike, body and wrists. The finesse and feel takes longer but is worth it! Everything happens in such a short period of time it's a little tough but you'll start to feel what works and what doesn't. 

Since seems you got a 9 speed shifter, you are going to need a 9 speed cassete, like the Shimano HG80 SLX 9 Speed Cassette. As for deraileurs, you can use the Shimano RD-M615, wich is marketed as 10 speed, but it will work with your setup with no problem ( I used an Alivio RD wich is 9 speed on a 7 speed bike for a long time, it gave me very nice shifting and reduced chain slap on that bike, which i used to go to work.) What is important to match is the shifter and the cassette, they must be of the same speed. As for RDs, you can use practically any shadow plus RD you can get your hands on as long as its medium or even long cage. Because you are on 9 speed, the medium cage is enough for you, will give you a ligther RD with better ground clearance, but a long cage one will do the job too. The ones you cannot use are the Zee and Saint RDs, because they are short cage model, so if you are going for double or triple rings in front, they cannot take up enough chain links for the front shifts.
