By sheer evasion. Moral realism does not demand that derived moral facts are correct, stable, or universal, only that there really are basic moral facts that are real. Utilitarians are still moral realists. They have a moral value, and they consider it real. Likewise Kantians are moral realists, mutual respect for autonomy is a moral value they consider real. The relativism of different individual pictures of the world cannot address their moral arguments. They are based in a real theory of human nature (or the nature of all intelligent beings, including humans). How can their basic principles be attacked, when it is always possible that the reasoning of individuals unconsciously relies upon some similar principle, but is always wrong because of psychological or political manipulations? You have a more material repetition of the noumenon/phenomenon problem. If there is enough noise, you can't be sure there wasn't a signal. I would fall back, as usual on pyschoanalysis and the philosophical traditions related to it (e.g. Schopenhauer's Will to Live and related consequents) We do seem to be able to take a composite of moralities, factor out local influences, and find things that are real guiding principles behind human actions. (To my mind, obviously 'killing is bad' is not one of those, or war would get less common, not more common, over time. If we could clearly see a basic moral fact, we would observe some kind of convergence toward it, the same way sciences converge toward precision with regard to actual applications, even as their theories do not become more similar at root. We need to look for universals that are much less direct, and are purposely obscured, rather than focused by culture, politics and psychology. Welcome to the era of the conspiracy theory.) Those principles do lead people to construct moralities, even if those moralities themselves have an ongoing evolution. If that is the case, you can't get past that 'noise' to address the underlying issue of moral realism directly. But it may all be wishful thinking. 

The laws of science are implicitly probabilistic, or they would never change. Something can be disproven by a weight of evidence, if that evidence mounts up to a force that makes the original unlikely. This is because the existing science itself is taken up based on evidence collected in imperfect ways, and therefore limited as to how convincing it can be. But no theory has ever fallen to a specific event. Before they can be accepted, paradigms put a layer of settled evidence around themselves that outweighs any single observation, at least for a while. (Lakatos gives a lot of documentation of this kind of thing.) So miracles and science can coexist, as long as the miracles do not pile up and create contrasting predictions more reliable than the existing theories. 

Take a look at Meinongianism, which is basically an extensive experiment in what it would take to put negative facts on par with positive ones logically. "There are no unicorns" means for every thing, it is not a unicorn. On the other hand 'there is a horse' means what it says, and the 'there' even has an antecedent, because the horse would, in fact, have to be somewhere, even if we don't know exactly where. The former is shadowy because we don't necessarily know what all the things are, and we have to admit right off that we cannot investigate each of them, so it might be meaningless in the long run. The latter is clear. Every principally negative fact is, in effect, a universal quantification, a much higher-order logical artifact than a simple proposition. Whereas most (though not all) positive facts can be captured by simple propositions. To put these two things together as the basis of your logic makes room for a broad range of category errors and other problems. We would prefer to stick to 'positive facts' (and in particular only those logical facts statable propositionally), and place or build quantification on top of propositional logic. 

This is a major topic of debate. "17.2 The Master said, â€œBy nature people are similar; they diverge as the result of practice." So clearly if that divergence leads some to be virtuous and other not to be, either: 

Since you will not actually present a meaningful argument against what you object to in the comments, I will rewrite this more pointedly: Why would it be a good thing if people did not ever impose their will on others? We sometimes imagine it is so in our overdeveloped post-Christian Western mindset, but we also know better. We know that biology tends to help us make bad decisions. As a standard example, we know that post-partum depression is perfectly natural and very common, but that a mother who has just had a child should not be allowed to kill herself for the sake of the child, and society in general. So having to justify your decisions by balancing them with the opinions of others is, in general, a good thing. And commonly decided laws help us to do that. You are adopting an extremist Christian martyred point of view, where simply losing an argument over what you should be allowed to do makes you oppressed. But that is not realistic. We know how depression, paranoia, cultism and other forms of self-absorption work, and that they require decisive intervention to which the self-absorbed person or group is going to object. We need definite limits on intervention, but we cannot totally sacrifice people to their own impairment or to their temporary emotional state. Addiction is one such temporary emotional state. While I do not approve of drugs being banned, I do think there should be some respectful way to limit consumption so that addicts are motivated to face withdrawal and recover their lives. So is suicidality in about three-quarters of cases. We know that people who are prevented from committing suicide by legal intervention become grateful this happened, relatively quickly, in over 70% of cases. 

The requirement for intuition is not with morality. You can have a morality based upon just about anything, including the whims of your master, or the whims of some dead master who imagined talking to God. Many people do. But things change when it comes to your intention to justify your thinking. No system of justification can exist without some sort of axioms. Whether you explicitly state them or not, you have some basis for your judgments, and you string together judgments according to some set of rules, which are simply the active form of axioms. What is not covered by accepted or negotiated rules, has to come from interpretation. That means that assent to the rules themselves requires interpretation as a basis. The rules cannot be given to you without a grounding in your interpretation of your situation. As Descartes pointed out a long time ago, if you dwell upon it long enough, it seems obvious that interpretation necessarily involves starting from internal sensation. The feeling of assent you give to a statement, the idea that you understand anything, is based on an emotional reaction. Most folks informally call that emotion 'intuition'. 

From a Hegelian pantheistic point of view, I would say that no subject is necessary. If information is an innate aspect of matter, and awareness is simply the ability to process information, then awareness precedes the subject by quite a distance. The subject itself must coalesce and evolve. To ground this physically, we can say that a colony of bacteria responds to a stimulus, and therefore has some kind of awareness, without having to consider any of the bacteria to be a conscious subject or to consider the collection of them a separate organism from the group of cells. From a phenomenological/evolutionary point of view built on that observation, the subject does not truly exist until it encounters an 'Other', another source of logic than its own. If the flow of logic were unimpeded, and there were no tension between minds, there would be no need to concentrate observation and precipitate a subject. Identity is only necessary in contrast with the 'All', and would not exist if there were only perfect mental harmony in the world, unimpeded by nonmental matter or the influence of other minds. Such a world could be aware but never contain subjects. As it is, we can look back to a time when our own world would have shown awareness without yet having subjects. 

The most common category errors generally go by separate names with which most folks are more familiar. Included are things like 

Having given an answer that responds to the surface of the question, I would like to give a different one that I feel addresses its core. Atheism does not need to meet this criticism at all. It should not accept the golden rule, or some moderate refinement of it, as a basis for ethics. This principle is simply a warmed-over compromise between religions, abstracted out of what they tend to have in common. We like it because most modern atheists are from traditions where it is prominent, and because the idea is simple. But atheism is, by its nature as a 'negative principle', pluralistic at its basis. There are many, many reasons to have a religion, and the motivations not to include multiple objections to each of those. There is not a single core of atheism, and atheists of different stripes, in general, should find ethical systems that represent their true motivations. For instance, an atheism motivated like Dawkins', flowing from his understanding of our species' biology, suggests we learn from evolution and choose a tenable principle in accord with our nature as animals. This has a framing largely in line with Nietzsche's call to be 'beyond' good and evil and to make the 'art of the self' the primary ethical motivation. Art does not need an audience, but it is always better when it expects and finds one. To make art of the self, then, involves other people, and so you cannot alienate or destroy them. You have a good use for their regard and their ideas, and for that reason, you need their respect. The alternate form of this is 'follow the will to power', but it is too easily misunderstood. It is easy to see the power of destruction, but, in general, it is a short-sighted option that betrays a lack not just of wisdom, but of taste, including awareness of your environment and how you use it. So, working dialectically, I might refine the Golden Rule by opposing it: "Do unto others as you, as an animal, naturally do. When that precipitates undesirable responses, adapt. But adapt as a social primate with a wide vision of the world: in a way that protects your cultural standing, contributes to maintaining your social structures and does not forestall the future development of your individual relationships." 

An argument addresses an intended position, not necessarily a real situation. A straw-man argument is a purposeful misunderstanding of the position, usually an oversimplification, but not necessarily. (Some straw-man arguments against complex systems like Catholicism or Post-Modernism often exaggerate the complexity of the actual position to make it seem untenably abstruse.) If the straw man argument still misrepresents what the original speaker meant it remains a misrepresentation, even if what he meant was wrong and the misrepresentation is somehow closer to the real facts. 

This basic idea is called the "Principle of Plenitude", and it is considered valid in realms like classical mathematics. Anything you can describe in a mathematically exact form, is assumed to be available for you to use mathematically. But even then, blatant inconsistencies force you to choose some imaginary objects over others. The clearest traditional example is that you cannot have a single set of everything, and the ability to know what is in and outside of every set in the universe with perfect precision. Choosing both nets you Russel's Paradox: the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements must both include and exclude itself. So you cannot have your cake and eat it, too, if you want to be able to navigate your imaginary universe in a way that preserves the ability to do things like use language, and map your imaginings onto the outside world occasionally. Mathematics itself is therefore not uniquely determined, you can choose some concepts over others. But, aside from that latitude, which is not very broad, every 'plenary' imaginary universe that is internally stable is equivalent to some model of Mathematics as a whole, and every less complete one is equivalent to some mathematical model.
