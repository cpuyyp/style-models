There is nothing else you can do. They can hurt. A lot. But generally aren't an issue. The exception to this rule, is the Arizona bark scorpion which is found in the Sonoran desert through AZ and southern CA (the area you are headed to). These diminutive critters pack a powerful punch, and can lead to partial paralysis, seizures, and respiratory distress or failure. These symptoms are more common in the elderly, small children, or those with compromised immune systems. Your best treatment is prevention: 

I have found sleeping with my boots inside the bag is the ONLY way to go when it is really cold out. Moderately cold, sure you can tough out the re-thaw in the morning - but real cold... forget it. It is tough to get over the psychological barrier of putting boots in your bag - but it will make a difference. A few points to consider: 

I have heard many people say that eating snow actually can increase dehydration since the energy required for the body to heat up and melt the snow is greater than the benefits received from the moisture in the snow. Truth or fiction? And please back it with solid physiological evidence. 

The recommended depth you mention is standard Leave no Trace guidelines for most regions, and strikes a balance between: 

Sorry to ruin your enchantment, but from the photos, it looks like a Muscovy duck: a species native to Central and South America and Mexico, but considered invasive in the United States.* They are often acquired as pets, then released (or escape) and can quickly overrun an area. They are indicated in the transmission of disease, destruction of property, and competition with native species. It is illegal to release them, and their possession and disposal are the subject of a Federal Control Order released in 2010 which states in part: 

First, lets dispel a common myth: Rock fire rings do absolutely nothing to contain, corral, or control a fire. That being said, a fire needs 3 things: air, fuel, and heat. An overabundance of one will create an uncontrollable fire. Thus, keep the following in mind: 

Batteries over time can (and often do) leak battery acid and cause corrosion. I've seen this happen quite a bit in head-lamps -- possibly because they do get some moisture in them if worn during aerobic activity? -- but also in hand-held Talkabout(TM) type radios, avalanche beacons, gps, etc. With batteries removed, it is impossible for the device to be accidentally turned on, thus draining the battery and leaving you in the dark when you really need it. (Purely anecdotally, I feel batteries last longer if stored separate... perhaps there is some minute, but cumulative energy leak when in a headlamp?) 

Yes you can. And more to the point, you should (save weight, and leave no trace). I have not found a backpacking cooking mess that could not be cleaned with a combination of (in this order): 

Any Wilderness Areas. Seriously. The legal mandates for designating "Wilderness" in the US (as defined by congress) have very rigorous criteria established by each of the major land agencies. Take a look a the Forest Service process for an example. Size, lack of roads, lack of altering (logging, invasive plants), opportunities for solitude are all defined criteria. However, there are many empty stretches of land that are not Wilderness, and there are many Wilderness areas that are "Wild" by law, but not in reality (lots of visitors, close to civilization, etc.) Now, which areas are actually the wildest? That is entirely subjective and dependent on where you go. Wander 1/2 mile off the busiest trail, you might not see a soul. Exploring a slot canyon, you might feel like the last person on earth, even though a highway runs parallel. Often "wild" is a state of mind. For your specific criteria, you might do best to start with a map of Wilderness Areas, find the center of the biggest one, overlay a map of city lights, and a map of flight paths and see if there is any green showing through the lights and flights... (Though from personal experience, the majority of commercial flights are high enough you never notice. It's low-flying tourist flights that disturb - and many Wilderness areas have laws against this.) 

Ventilation is your friend. I hate to say it - but the glasses I've found that have this dialed are usually a little more expensive. After suffering through fog, wind sheer, and poor optics, I found a high end pair of glasses in the back-country, and my eyes were opened. As a second option, removing your glasses immediately when you stop (or even sliding them to the end of your nose) might keep the the steam from your face and breath from clouding them up for a few moments longer. As a third option, saliva is an old scuba-diver trick to keep masks from fogging up. Spit on your lenses that wipe them clean. (I've had limited success in non-aqueous environs.) 

For general all-purpose cutting this saw has proven to be the most dependable, versatile, and reliable I have worked with.* It cuts through dead and live wood, and I have chewed through a trees at 18" and beyond. It is light, and the JS blade (with hardened teeth) is the longest lasting. The blade is replaceable for different hardness woods. For more serious trail maintenance check out the venerable pulaski for a good combo of cutting and grubbing out drainage issues. (Though tackling that level of maintenance should probably be done with the blessing and supervision of relevant land managers.) 

Chemicals: Permethrine: After 2 years of living in the tropical rain forest, and suffering the tenacity of mosquitoes and no-see-ums which manage to find their way through any tiny imperfection in the net, I just started treating my nets with Permethrine This stuff is highly toxic to fish, and insects, so care should be used when applying it - however I have found it to be highly effective in keeping mosquitoes and no-see-ums away from the net so they don't ever find those imperfections. DEET: Although highly effective as a repellent, prolonged exposure, to high quantities especially in hot sweaty environments, has been linked in some toxicological reports to some ailments. Regardless, I don't much care for doping up before I sleep - so tend to avoid it, though spraying clothes can be a good added measure of protection. Mosquito Coils: I am not sure the chemical agent involved, or the safety of prolongued inhalation of the smoke, but mosquito coils burnt around the sleeping area reduces the number of insects visiting. Citronella: Some people swear by citronella and lemongrass, either as an oil applied to the skin for short-term reduction, or a candle that provides a smoke repellent. Eucalyptus Oil: Provides a short term repellent, and can provide some relief for itching from those bites that already snuck through. As a final precaution, setting a (controlled) smoky fire burning in the corner of your hut, or tarp will help reduce the number of mosquitoes hanging around throughout the night. 

Blisters are caused by friction. Your skin is not very slippery. Applying moleskin and duct-tape over a "hot-spot" adds a protective layer between your skin and shoe. Thus as your shoe slides, it rubs against the tape or mole-skin instead of your skin. Pointers: 

Wilderness medicine protocols taught by the major Wilderness First Aid / First Responder training companies (and subsequently adopted by most outdoor organizations) are fairly standard and quite clear about wound management in the back-country. The standard accepted practice for treating a wound is: 

This (Jetboil Crunchit Recycling Tool) was found by googling "crush isobutane fuel can" and reading this second result (right below the outoors.SE question) for the link. 

These reasons apply to all ecosystems (apline, desert, grassland, etc) and as such, camping away from water sources is good 'Leave No Trace' practice in all situations.

As stated in the title: is there any evidence that the hormones etc that the body produces during intercourse increases one's likelihood of encountering a bear in the back-country? 

*You could argue the trail should have been placed in a better drained area, but sometimes that is unavoidable. 

Depending on what you mean by "can you eat it" you can eat anything really, it just depends on how much worse off you want to be afterward. According to this article, dangers include: trichinelliosis - from eating meat of a carnivorous animal brucellosis - can be had from raw caribou e. coli, and salmonella are rampant tapeworm - and other worms are fairly common in fish. In fact, all Sushi sold in the United States legally must be frozen before it can be served. 

It sounds like you have flick-lock poles (that compress the outside tube). Most of those you can tighten or loosen the flick lock by twisting it. This allows you to keep adding more pressure as the metal fatigues when the poles age. If you can, try loosening that micro-adjust before locking everything down for travel. Regardless, leaving them locked for a few days while traveling won't hurt them. If it does, then you should probably invest in higher-quality poles. (Remember, these should last for many months and thousands of miles of hiking... a few days of storage won't hurt them). 

Our dog loves winter sports - but after a few miles on the trails in soft snow, he often develops snowballs between his paw pads - usually one big one right in the middle. Are there ways to minimize / prevent this from happening? I have heard really bad snow buildup can lead to raw / bleeding paw pads. 

I carry a pair of cotton socks on every backpacking trip for one reason: To sleep in. After a day on the trail, nothing like a dry pair of comfortable cotton socks to absorb all that foot moisture and leave your feet toasty dry by morning. Helps keep your feet happy and healthy. 

MSR WhisperLite backpacking stoves are ubiquitous, but they lack a key function: the ability to simmer easily. How can you set a WhisperLite to simmer without having to constantly watch the stove and micro-adjust the fuel valve? 

When crossing a glacier (or other mountaineering activity for that matter) I've heard that roping everyone together without having a fixed anchor is falling out of fashion since more often than not if someone takes a tumble into a crevasse then end up pulling their partner(s) in with them. What is the current expert advice? Is it better to tie everyone together, or keep the rope handily unattached and ready to perform a rescue if someone goes in? 

Additional sources, all of which authoritatively conclude the sports beverages do not prevent the onset of hyponatremia. If you are drinking to much, it is too much, regardless of what you are drinking. Consensus Statement of the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference, Cape Town, South Africa 2005: 

Reliability: So far so good - no mass returns of skis due to breakage. Since the binding plate is integrated into the ski, there is more even distribution of force, where as five screws create five weak points. Advantages: The biggest advantage comes from being able to dial in the "sweet-spot" of the skis. Ski's vary greatly in composition and dimensions, and shifting your bindings forward or backward by centimeters to adjust the center of gravity can make a world of differences in their responsiveness and handling.

Depending on your activity level, access to water, etc, the types of food you carry should change accordingly. Some points to consider: 

Interestingly seems to suggest that at warmer temperatures, Mayo is more effective at killing E.Coli - likely (I imagine) to the general faster pace of biological processes at higher temps. 

You have heard both answers because both are right depending on the area and ecosystem. Established trails: If there is an established trail going where you need to go, you should stay on it. Even to the point that in a mucky area stay in the tread, rather than create a new trail beside it which might be dry for a while, but will eventually become a new mess. This creates "braided trails" which can mar a whole open meadows are a pain to rehabilitate.* Never cut switch-backs. Cross country: when striking out cross-country, you need to consider the surface and the impact it can handle. In alpine areas, if in doubt, spread out. Primarily we do this because it creates multiple faint trails instead of one impacted one, which can recover faster. Also, you would be surprised how many people see an obvious trail and say, "wonder where that goes" and follow it, compounding the problem. They are less likely to do this on a faint trail. A major exception is in the desert where you might encounter cryptobiotic soil in which a single footprint can last dozens of years. If you can not find a way around the crypto (which is critical for preventing erosion) 1) re-consider why you need to go where you are going, or 2) make the fewest number of steps through it, and have everyone follow in the same footprints. Sidebar: If you do find yourself wandering cross-country, please do not build a cairn to encourage others to follow. This funnels impact along a single route creating erosion issues where dozens of people could wander spread out without having that much impact. A large chunk of my time as a Wilderess Ranger was spent kicking down cairns on non-established trails. Let the next traveler figure out their own route. 

To answer the original question: At no point is the cord so small that you need to seriously worry about it cutting through the attachment points. Unless you pulling it through at high speed under pressure. Under normal use conditions there is not enough friction at these points to cut through (even if high winds) and simply being small won't make it blast through. If you are concerned, wrap a bit of duct-tape around the attachment point, and watch for wear. Caveat: The issue I have found, is I have not come across a super-thin cordage that does not have a significant amount of stretch. Nothing I've tried can keep my tarp tent as taut as parachute (or 550) cord. 

As for insulating power, since dead air is what provides that insulation. Even the highest rated (base on R value) high-end inflatable is going to be useless if it deflates. Closed-cell foam (such as ole' blue) are full of little isolated air pockets that trap air permanently and never deflate (though they can compress over time). FWIW - I use a more expensive inflatable 90% of the time, largely for its small pack size, and better comfort (when it holds air through the night, which is about 75% of the time.) However, when I'm heading out on a snow-camping trip, I always bring the dependable insulating power of 'ole blue as well and double-pad it. 

In short, yes to all points in your question. It is different, requires more control, has more room for style, and is a hell of workout. But beyond that, and beyond back-country access, it is pure, unadulterated, fun. "Free your heels and your mind will follow." 

The answer will vary depending on WHERE you are: Desert: Lots of dry rock. Lots of ledges. Lots of snakes. Better to look before you leap over one. And, you get pretty good at judging which rocks might shift on you before you step on them. Lots of people I've hiked with have had their ankles narrowly missed by rattlers hiding under. I never plant my foot blindly. Wet Forest: Lots of slippery logs. Lots of snakes. However, stepping on any log (and many rocks) will result in your feet squirting right off the top (slick) or punching though (rotten). When hiking in wet forests, I try to never step on a log, root, or rock unless I've tested it first. Nor do I blindly plant my foot on the back side of one. Go around, be cautious. Temperate Forest: Lots of logs and rocks. Moderate amount of snakes. When dry, logs are usually fine to step on. When wet, they can be deadly. Know your area, judge the risk. In general - chances are you are smart enough to judge whether a rock/log is large enough or stable enough to support you. If not, you'll learn quickly. So a blanket "never step on one" seems unfounded.
