The HG-50 is a cassette, not a freewheel. The freewheel is a part of the hub, and normally you never have to remove it. (On old bikes, the cassette and the freewheel came as one unit, and screwed onto the hub body. Nobody makes them like that anymore.) Read the Park Tools link that Daniel gave you. Go about halfway down to "Cassette Cog Lockring Removal and Installation" - it should tell you everything. You'll need a lockring tool to unscrew the lockring, a wrench to hold the lockring tool, and a chainwhip to hold the cogs and keep them from spinning as you're loosening the lockring. 

By the 1950s, this type of braking system was becoming obsolete, so it's no later than that. I found a few pictures on the net that look like your bike. They're all British, and all from the 1930s: Mercury, BSA, Raleigh. In those days, the British companies all basically made the same bikes, so it's hard to tell them apart. Look more closely at the front of the head tube - there might be a badge there. Is it a good price? You'll probably spend way more than $70 to restore it, so it really doesn't matter. 

Normally, the cap just unscrews. Obviously, that's not the case here. Use something like the tip of a knife, a small screwdriver or a chisel to break it up and pry it out. But try not to mess up the threads too bad, you'll need them for the next step. I think what you have is a square-taper crank design; the bottom bracket spindle has a square-shaped tip, the crank is wedged onto that tip and secured in place with the nut. Once the nut is off, you'll need a crank puller. It's a cheap tool, you can get one at any bike shop. The puller has a sleeve that threads into the crank (into the same threads that the cap attaches to); then you screw down a bolt inside the sleeve that pushes against the spindle, and hopefully pops the crank off. This looks like an old bike, so it might be stuck on there pretty good. When reassembling, just put the crank back on and tighten the nut. Make sure you put plenty of grease on the mating surfaces. 

You can try modifying the derailleur so it fits into the narrower space. Without seeing it, I have no idea if that's practical or not. If not, there's nothing you can do besides replacing the crank and/or derailleur. 

Forget the peer pressure and do whatever the hell you want. Your reluctance to spend money is wise. It's a wisdom that many people lack. But if you are gonna spend money, then here are my suggestions, in order of importance. 

One wheel (probably the rear) isn't attached securely, and it shifts while under load, causing the tire to rub. Since it's a folding bike, there may be some joint in the frame that's allowing excessive movement, again causing tire rub. Tires are under-inflated. 

There are plenty of mountain bikes with 26" wheels, and they're not hard to find. I have no idea why you'd even ask that. If you have disk brakes, then yes, you can put on smaller wheels. The only problem with that: your cranks will be closer to the ground, so there's a greater chance of hitting your pedals when you're cornering or riding over a log or something. Depending on your bike and what you use it for, that may be something you can live with. 

No, these brakes have nothing to do with Ultegra. A lot of unscrupulous Ebay sellers put unrelated keywords into the title to get more search hits. It's against Ebay rules, but it's pretty widespread, unfortunately. 

Of course. 29 inches is the same rim size as 700c, so there are plenty of tires out there. For maximum speed, you want the narrowest tire that you can safely get on there. Take off your tire and measure the inner rim width. Refer to the chart at the bottom of this page to see which tire widths would be suitable. 

Don't let them con you into spending more money that you need to. You already have a good bike that fits you, just upgrade the shifters and you'll be all set. 

Some electric bicycles have regenerative braking. That's the only thing I can think of that comes close to answering your question. Theoretically, you could use something like a parachute to slow down, but this would create way too many problems (side winds, chute getting tangled in the back wheel, having to retract the chute when you don't need it anymore, etc). 

This would suggest that there are two grease fittings on the bottom bracket. Modern bikes don't have them, but this ain't a modern bike. The only way to be sure is to take it apart. 

Your other option is to move the chainring. I don't know what your cranks look like, so it may not be practical, but maybe you can add some spacers underneath the chainring mounting bolts. This may also require longer bolts. 

Sounds like your shifter is jammed. You might be able to repair it, but I'd just get a new one. To confirm this diagnosis, remove the cable. If you still can't move the shifter, then you know it's bad. And next time, don't leave your bike out all winter. 

The top cap bolt doesn't actually bear any weight once everything is assembled. It's only there to get the stem in the correct position before you tighten the pinch bolts (and as a back-up in case the pinch bolts get loose). So that won't be a problem. Also: composite materials are a lot more susceptible to damage from over-tightening things. Get a torque wrench for this job. Yeah, they're a little pricey - but if you can afford carbon fiber, you can afford a torque wrench. 

No, usually you don't. That's something that should have been done at the factory. If the threads do need chasing, then you'll have to take it to a shop. The point of chasing is to remove paint over-spray - you can't do that with a toothbrush. A chasing tool probably costs more than a Surly frame, so doing it yourself isn't practical. 

When the bolt is tightened, is the cable hanger free to move around? If it is, then it can't be causing the problem. But if it's held in place rigidly by the clamp, it probably means that it's preventing the clamp from closing all the way. In other words, the clamp is clamping the hanger, not the seatpost like it's supposed to. Another thing to investigate: remove the seatpost and the bolt, and check for debris in the seat tube slot. You should be able to slide a credit card in there easily. I had a problem like that once, caused by a sloppy paint job that left some overspray in the slot, which prevented the two parts of the clamp from coming together. I used a hacksaw blade to clean it out. 

Don't assume that it's the BB. When you press down on the pedals, you're actually putting stress on many different parts of the bike, and any one of them could be making noise. Your description of the sound makes me think of the chain. Try lubing the chain, and see if the noise goes away. 

No, you can't. Indexed shifting requires all the components to be precisely matched. The shifters, derailleurs, chain and cassette all need to be compatible. You didn't say why you want to replace your shifter. If the one you have works, then just leave it alone. Otherwise, you have the following options:

I just built a mountain bike with Avid BB7 brakes and Shimano V-brake levers. I used the exact same configuration on another bike, and it worked beautifully. But on this one, the brakes are just weak as hell. I know that disk brakes are supposed to have a short break-in period, but I'm way beyond that now, and still no change. What's going on and how can I fix it? 

It's almost never necessary, I don't know where you got this idea. The only possible reason I can imagine for changing the BB during a single-speed conversion is if the chainline is way off, and you can't fix it by respacing the chainring. You might be thinking of an eccentric bottom bracket. This is indeed one way to adjust the chain tension on a single-speed; but an eccentric requires a special BB shell, so if your frame doesn't already have an eccentric, there's no way to install it. 

$URL$ That crank uses 5-hole chainrings with a 110 mm bolt circle diameter. Make sure it's narrow enough for 10-speed chains. That's a very common combination, you shouldn't have trouble finding one. Yes, you'll definitely need a new chain. The bad news: you might need to also replace one or both derailleurs. A front derailleur has a limit on the range it can handle (the difference between the largest and smallest chainring). You need to look up the specs on your derailleur model. And no matter what, you'll probably have to move the front derailleur higher. A rear derailleur has two numbers: the maximum sprocket size (irrelevant here, since you're not changing the sprockets), and the "chain wrap". There's an article here which explains the concept; it's about Campagnolo parts, but you'll get the idea. If you widen the gear range too much, you'll wind up with slack in your chain when you're on the small ring in the front and in the back. Can you live with that? If so, then disregard this paragraph. Otherwise, look up your derailleur specs and see if the new range will work. Another way to get around the derailleur problems: get a larger small ring as well, so the range stays the same. 

I don't know the official recommendation, but the clamp could be problematic with a carbon DT. Here's the thing, though: I don't think the clamp is strictly necessary. The purpose of the arm is to keep the bike from swaying laterally - you'll accomplish that as long as the arm is somehow attached to the frame. What I would do is put the DT in the clamp, but don't tighten the clamp: instead, use a rope or strap to tie the arm to the DT. Another option: don't use the arm at all. Instead, use ratchet straps on either side to keep the bike upright. A lot of people do that when transporting motorbikes. This method seems more secure, but it might be difficult without a second set of hands. 

Check the label on the tube - does it say '26 x 1 3/8' by any chance? If so, this is actually a completely different size than the standard MTB 26". Get a tube that says something like 26x2.1 or 26x1.9 - the point is, the tire width should be expressed as a decimal, not a fraction. See Sheldon Brown's tire size chart. Yeah, I know, it's stupid - I didn't come up with this system. 

If the problem was worse in some gears, I'd say you have worn-out cogs. But you say that it doesn't depend on the gear... So I'm going to guess that your freewheel mechanism is failing, and the pawls are slipping when they're under heavy load. 

Pretty much any square-taper BB with the same spindle length will work. Doesn't even have to be Shimano. 1.37" x 24tpi is English, like almost all mountain bikes. (If it is Italian, it'll be immediately obvious when you try to install it - the shell diameter is a couple mm greater.) 

Grease would make the rubber slip, defeating the purpose of the mechanism. And it might cause the rubber to deteriorate. Best solution is to just throw these grips in the garbage, and get some better-designed ones. I've seen several types that use an external clamp (or two clamps) to hold the grip in place - I'm sure that would work better. But if you're really set on keeping these grips, and don't mind getting "creative", you might be able to make an alternate locking mechanism. The expansion plugs that they use with carbon steering tubes would be ideal - except they're too big. So you want something that works on the same principle, but fits inside the handlebar. Go to the fastener section at a hardware store, and see if you can find expansion bolts that are the right size. 

One of the cotter pins is in backwards. I did that once by accident when reassembling. It's easy to fix - take the nut off, tap the pin out with a hammer, then insert it in the opposite direction from what it was before.
