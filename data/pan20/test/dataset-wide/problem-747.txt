What are my options? (Yes I know I can just cycle around the bank and see, or also ask around, I'd just rather plan ahead.) 

While chain locks can be broken, each one takes some time, and breaking one of them doesn't help you with the others. It might draw more attention, but for a somewhat shabby-looking bike, it should probably not be worth the trouble. I would just leave them on one of the bike racks near my home, and at work I have the shed arrangement. (I will have a ring lock too, for convenience and for driving around with in case I need to leave the bike for a couple of seconds.) 

In the latest episode of my disastrous bike maintenance attempts, I got a sub-standard torx bit that broke off in the bleed screw of my Tektro Vela disc brake caliper. Here's a sligthly overexposed picture of the brake caliper in question, the bleed screw is circled in red: 

I managed to damage the headset on my Merida Speeder 300. In particular, I warped the bottom bearing, and I need a replacement. Normally, this would be a simple matter of looking up the specifications of the model in question, except the FSA website doesn't list a product numbered 61BP or 57/61BP. I took a caliper and measured some of the parts. The steerer measured 28.4mm at the top, and flared to 39.8mm at the crown. I probably messed up the measurements, and that steerer is a 1-1/8"-1.5". The cups are semi-integrated, the top one measured 40.1 mm on the inside, and 32.4mm inside the lip. The bottom one was 47 and 41 mm on the same. Of course, I couldn't get at the tube because the cups were in the way, and my handling of the caliper is suspect.. So, what is this product and what are the critical measurements of it, with an eye to getting a replacement. 

Intuitively I would think the public bike share would be my go-to option. But I'd like to ask the more experienced: Is that really the best options? Would it be cheaper than the other two options? Are the velib stands ubiquitous enough to not add too much walking to my route? Is it customary to use something else? either rent or borrow I suppose. My question is: In broad strokes, what are the options for renting or borrowing a bike for a week-long stay? Is that common at all in Paris? Should I try to do this through certain websites? Local bike shop? Some other way? Or - perhaps Also or use some public bike system if one exists 

Considering that the screw is slightly recessed into a somewhat expensive safety device, I'd like to find out a way to get the bit out in the least destructive way. If all else fails, I'm considering eating crow and taking my bike to the LBS in the hope that they'll have the tools, experience and/or spare parts to fix this. 

And another shot from the side. Notice how the bleed port is recessed rather than the bleed nipple you'd usually see on a Tektro brake. 

So despite the bike attracting attention to being with, the chances of it being stolen - when locked of course - are lower. Notes: 

The IJ river flows through Amsterdam. Well, actually, it flows north of historical Amsterdam, but these days there's a northern borough. I've never been north of the river before, and I'm going there soon. I thought I'd take my bike, but they're not very amphibian, and it occurred to me I don't know whether I can safely cross anywhere... 

Googling this, I found a headset called FSA Gravity HS No. 55 SX Pro, which has the following specs: 

The other side of the nut is flat. Only the nut is threaded, and it's the only one that has flat sides for a wrench to grip. What I have tried so far is to grip the free end with a pair of pliers, but I didn't get a good enough grip to get the other nut loose. I have tried to push the axle out from the free end, including whacking it with a rubber mallet a few times, and I even tried to put my weight on the hub with the free end resting against the ground. The axle hasn't budged at all, as far as I can tell, and I'd at least like to have a second opinion before I try to hammer the axis harder than I already have. 

I'm a recent convert to cycling, having moved to Amsterdam, and I intend to buy a U-lock for a bike I'm getting. Now, people have recommended that I buy U-locks with a "sold secure" label - but in a couple of bike shops I've been to I haven't seen any items with this label. Granted, there wasn't that much variety, but it did make me wonder - is that certification very popular with lock manufacturers (of reasonable-quality locks)? Or is it more so for manufacturers in other countries than here? I need to decide whether to limit myself to locks with the certification or think of some other way to evaluate locks. 

I believe the cause of my troubles is that those outward-facing ruffles have been tightening the nut. The other side looks like this: 

So, I have a stuck lock nut on one side of my front axle, and I can't seem to get the axle out pushing on the other side. I need some pointers on diagnosing and repairing this. The bike is a Merida Speeder 300, and the product page lists the hub as "Bearing disc". The bearings are cartridge bearings, which means this answer doesn't help. Here's a shot of the stuck nut: 

While supposedly paradoxical, if you make your bike really stand out by adorning it with many stickers and/or painting it - it will actually be unattractive to steal. This has three reasons: 

I'm going to be in Paris this month for about a week for some conference. My accommodation is about ~15 min away by bicycle from where the conference in held, and for most of the days (say 4 or 5) I'll just be traveling there in the morning and going back in the evening. Now, I don't have a bike that I'm bringing with me, but I would like to use a bike in Paris. I can... 

There's nothing on the axle where a wrench could find purchase. The nut and assorted washers that came off are these: 

So, I have a pair of ambidextrous shifters on my bike. In other words, both shifters are ten-speed so that you can change the "handedness" of your handlebar if you want. This got me thinking, they could also be used for a 10x10 drivetrain. So, how many speed chainring is achievable with reasonably off-the-shelf components, and what (if anything) would stop me from building a 100-speed bike, and at what point?
