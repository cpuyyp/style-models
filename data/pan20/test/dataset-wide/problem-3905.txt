For any line bundle $F$, giving a map of sheaves $\mathcal O_X \to F$ is equivalent to giving a global section of $F$. In your case, take $F=Q \otimes L^{-1}$ with the map given by your exact sequence tensorized by $L ^{-1}$. As $F$ has no non-zero global section, the aforesaid map is trivial, so $\eta \otimes Id_{L^{-1}}$ is an isomorphism, and therefore so is $\eta$ too. 

Then I guess that the ample generator of some Picard group is in some case one generator which besides is ample. For example, the most basic example consists in taking the ample line bundle $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P^n}(1)$ over $\mathbb P^n$, which generates $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb P^n)$. Finally, if your question is : if the Picard group of a projective variety is monogen, then can we choose an ample generator? Then the answer is yes because for every $m\geq 1$, $L$ is ample iff $L^{\otimes m}$ is ample. Edit : I forgot to mention that in this case, the unicity of "the" ample generator is clear : indeed, if $L$ and $L^{-1}$ admit non trivial sections (say $s$ and $t$) then $st$ is a non-zero section of $\mathcal O_X$ thus is constant, so that $s$ and $t$ are both non-vanishing sections, which implies that $L$ is trivial. You can apply this to $L^{\otimes m}$ to get the unicity property. 

In general, we have the socalled projection formula: if $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism of ringed spaces, $\mathcal F$ an $\mathcal O_X$-module, and $E$ be a locally-free $\mathcal O_Y$ module of finite rank, then $f_* (\mathcal F \otimes f^{*} E) \simeq f_{*}\mathcal F \otimes E$. Edit (following Will's remark): The projection formula yields in the case of an open immersion $i:U \subset X$ the following identity : $i_* i^* F \simeq i_*\mathcal O_U \otimes F$. Therefore, if $U$ has codimension at least 2 in $X$, then $i_* i^* F\simeq F$ by normality of $X$. 

As Jason points out, the special fiber does not have a smooth negatively curved KE metrics in general (you can blow up the family along a subscheme supported on the special fiber without changing the assumptions you are working with, so certainly you can kill the property that the central fiber is canonically polarized). For simplicity, I assume that $\pi$ is projective. Then $X_0$ admits a singular Kähler-Einstein metric (in the sense of Boucksom-Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi). This is a smooth Kähler-Einstein metric on a Zariski open subset of $X_0$ (the complement of the augmented base locus $\mathbb B_+(K_{X_0})$), with some additional global properties. The reason is that $K_{X_0}$, even if it may not be ample, is certainly big, for instance by semicontinuity of the function $t\mapsto \dim H^0(X_t, K_{X_t}^{\otimes m})$ for any integer $m>0$. This function is actually constant by a deep theorem of Siu, but it is irrelevant here. 

One of my teacher in Probability once told us that this name (Central Limit Theorem) was just used (at the beginning) to stress the importance of the result -which plays a central role in the theory. Besides, the ambiguity led to several different translations, corresponding to both interpretations of the term "central". (e.g in French, we can find "théorème central limite" and "théorème de la limite centrale") 

Let me copy my remark to close the topic. If $\partial \bar \partial f$ is a constant matrix on $\mathbb C^n$, then it follows that for any complex line $L\subset \mathbb C^n$, $\Delta (f|_L)$ is constant, where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian on $L\simeq \mathbb C$ with respect to the restriction of the euclidean metric. In particular, either $f|–L$ or $-f|_L$ is subharmonic. As it is bounded as well, Liouville theorem implies that $f|_L$ is constant. Obviously, one can sweep $\mathbb C^n$ with complex lines intersecting at a given point, so that $f$ has to be constant. 

so here I guess $M$ is a compact Kähler manifold. Thanks to Yau theorem, we know that there exists a unique Kähler metric $h$ in each Kähler cohomology class such that $\mathrm{Ric}(h)=-g$ (more generally you can prescribed the Ricci form to be any form in the cohomology class of $c_1(M)$). So to answer your question, there are a lot of such metrics $h$, but there is only one such in each Kähler cohomology class of $M$. In particular, if $h$ lies in a (positive) multiple of $-c_1(M)$, then $h$ is proportional to $g$. 

This is a consequence of the generalized Lelong-Poincaré formula for vector bundles: denoting $D'$ the $(1,0)$ part of the Chern connection of $(E,h)$ and $\Theta_h(E)$ its Chern curvature, one has: $$dd^c \log |s|^2=\frac{1}{|s|^2}\cdotp \left( |D's|^2-\frac{|\langle D's,s\rangle|^2}{|s|^2}- \langle \Theta_h(E)s, s\rangle\right)$$ and essentially by Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, one has $$|s|^2\cdotp |D's|^2-|\langle D's,s\rangle|^2 \ge 0.$$ 

For any coherent sheaf $\mathcal F$, the sheaf $\mathcal F \otimes L^{\otimes m}$ is generated by its global sections for every $m\geq m_0(\mathcal F)$. The map $\Phi_{|L^{\otimes m}|} : X \to \mathbb P(H^0(X,L^{\otimes m})), x \mapsto [s_0(x): \ldots:s_N(x)]$ - where $(s_i)$ is a base of the space of global sections of $L^{\otimes m}$ - induces a embedding of $X$ in some projective space for every $m\geq m_0$. If you are working over $\mathbb C$, which seems to be the case, this is also equivalent for $L$ to admit a smooth hermitian metric $h$ whose curvature $\Theta_h(L)$ is a (striclty) positive $(1,1)$-form. 

In their paper "Monge-Ampère equations in big cohomology classes", Boucksom, Eyssidieux, Guedj and Zeriahi give an example (Ex 5.4 page 46 here : $URL$ of a nef and big line bundle over a smooth projective 3-fold which is not semi-ample. More precisely, every positive current in its cohomology class has poles along some subvariety. Furthermore, it is well-known (Lazarsfeld, PAG e.g) that a nef and big line bundle has a finitely generated sections ring iff it is semi-ample. In one word, their construction consists in using the famous example of Serre (and studied by Demailly-Peternell-Schneider) of a flat rank 2 vector bundle $E$ on some elliptic curve $C$, and considering on $V:=\mathbb P(E\oplus A)$ (for $A$ ample on $C$) the tautological line bundle $\mathcal O_{\mathbb P(V)}(1)$. 

A subharmonic function which is bounded from above near a polar set automatically extends through it. Therefore, any negative subharmonic function on $\mathbb C \setminus\{0,1\}$ induces a negative subharmonic function on $\mathbb C$, and by Liouville theorem, it must be constant. So the answer to your question is no. 

The answer to your question is no without further assumptions. Here are three counterexamples (one for each curvature's sign): 

Here is the way you get a non-vanishing holomorphic section which will trivialize your line bundle. Denote $U_1=\{[x:y]; x\neq 0 \}$ and $U_2=\{[x:y]; y\neq 0\}$, this is a covering of $\mathbb P^1$. The transition function of the bundle is $g_{12}([x:y])=e^{y/x}$ (you could also take $e^{x/y}$, this wouldn't change the argument), defined on $U_1 \cap U_2$. Then you may defined the following holomorphic functions: on $U_1$, you put $s_1([x:y]):=e^{y/x}$ and on $U_2$, $s_2([x:y]):=1$. Thus $s_1$ and $s_2$ are non-vanishing holomorphic functions, and on $U_1 \cap U_2$, you have $s_1=g_{12}s_2$ so that they form a section of our line bundle. EDIT: In particular the degree of the line bundle is 0! Moreover, on a Riemann surface (or more generally on any smooth projective complex variety), any line bundle admits a meromorphic section, so that the correspondence your are talking about still holds. 

First of all, I would say that there exists $\textit{one}$ good topology for psh functions, that is the $L^1_{loc}$ topology. One of the main result is the following one : Let $(u_n)$ be a sequence of psh functions on a connected open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C} ^n$ with $u_n \not \equiv -\infty $. We suppose that $(u_n)$ converges to $u$ psh, in the weak topology of distributions. Then $(u_n)$ is locally upper bounded and $u_n \to u$ in $L^p_{loc}(\Omega)$ for every $p\in[1,+\infty[$. Other similar results are : -every bounded subset of $Psh(\Omega) \cap L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ is relatively compact; -if $(u_n)$ is locally upper bounded on $\Omega$, then either $(u_n)$ converges locally uniformly to $-\infty$ on $\Omega$ (for the $L^1_{loc}$ topology), either there exists some subsequence converging to a psh function on $\Omega$ (in $ L^1_{loc}$ - or $L^p_{loc}, p\geq 1$, this is the same-). As for the references, the one I prefer is "Notions of convexity" by Hörmander, 94, around section 3.2. The online book of Demailly is good too, but far less detailed about this topic. 

In my opinion, the point is not that $R$ is the biggest in whatever sense you may give to this, but that the decomposition $T=R+S$ with $S=\sum \lambda_j [A_j]$ ($A_j$ being a $p$-dimensional analytic set), and $R$ having zero Lelong number along any $p$-dimensional analytic set. The uniqueness is clear because for $x$ generic in $A_j$, $\nu(R+S,x)=\lambda_j \nu([A_j],x)=\lambda_j$, which determines thus uniquely $\lambda_j$, and therefore $S$ and $R$. Now, if you really want to see that $R$ is the biggest current (in the sense of positivity of currents) such that $R$ has zero Lelong number along any $p$-dimensional analytic set, then you can proceed this way: assume that $T=S'+R'$ is another such decomposition. Then for $x$ generic in $A_j$, $\nu(T,A_j)=\nu(T,x)=\nu(S',x)=\nu(S',A_j)$. But it is a classical fact (see e.g Demailly, Complex analytic and differential Geometry, Proposition 8.16) that $S'-\nu(S', A_j) [A_j]$ is a closed positive current, so that $S' \geqslant S$, and therefore $R' \leqslant R$, which concludes. 

Well, it depends on what you call a Calabi-Yau manifold (there are several possible terminologies indeed). First of all, a compact Kähler manifold with trivial canonical class does not necessarily have holonomy group $SU_n$ (with respect to some Ricci-flat metric). More precisely, the holonomy group of some compact Kähler manifold $(X,\omega)$ is included in $SU_n$ iff there exists a non-zero parallel holomorphic $n$-form. As a consequence the restricted holonomy group $H_0$ is included in $SU_n$ iff $(X,\omega)$ is Ricci-flat. Now the holonomy groups of a Ricci flat compact Kähler manifold can be smaller than $SU_n$: think about any torus (the holonomy is trivial) or any holomorphic symplectic variety (the holonomy is $SP(n/2)$. However, there is a result, which was maybe what you had in mind: Theorem. Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact Kähler manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ with holonomy group $SU_n$. Then $X$ is projective and $H^0(X, \Omega_X^p)=0$ for every $0 < p < n$ and $\chi(\mathcal O_X)=1+(-1)^n$. A manifold with such properties is sometimes called Calabi-Yau, indeed. For a reference, see Beauville's article "Variétés Kähleriennes à première classe de Chern nulle". As for the non-compact case, I don't know if such a results holds. 

In the case where $X,Y$ are smooth oriented (compact) manifolds, you may do this using currents. Indeed, currents are continuous linear forms on the space of (compactly supportly) smooth differential forms. There is a natural way to push forward currents (by duality with the pull-back of smooth forms). Furthermore, the De Rham cohomology for currents is (naturally) isomorphic to the one of smooth forms. Therefore, you can push forward a smooth class considering it a current class, and using then the previous natural isomorphism. Moreover, you have the projection formula: $\alpha, \beta$ are forms with appropriate degree, then $f_{\star} (f^{\star} \alpha \cup \beta) = (\alpha \cup f_{\star} \beta)$. To sum up, the use of currents allows you to consider always duality on cohomology and not duality between homology and cohomology. 

In one variable, this is a trivial consequence of the standard local inversion theorem. Indeed, holomorphic functions are $C^1$ functions characterized by the fact that their differential is a similitude. And this property is stable by taking the inverse. to be more precise, if $g$ is holomorphic on some open set $U\subset \mathbb C$, and its differential (as a function $U \to \mathbb R^2$) satisfies that it is invertible everywhere, with differential being a similitude. So the functions is a local diffeomorphism, and the differential of the inverse is the inverse of the differential, so is still a similitude. Therefore, $g$ is a local biholomorphism. The statement of IFT is a direct consequence of the local inversion theorem then. 

To complete the answer of Divierietti and the comment of Roy Smith, here is a statement which might interest you: Theorem If $X,Y$ are varieties over a field $k$, assume $X$ is smooth and $Y$ proper containing no rational curves. Then any rational map $X\dashrightarrow Y$ is everywhere defined. You can find that statement in Debarre's book Higher Dimensional Geometry, Corollary 1.44 p.31. In particular, if $X$ is smooth projective and contains no rational curves, then its automorphism group is equal to the group of its birational endomorphisms. 

I would suggest you two references; the first one is Demailly's survey on Hodge theory ([B3] here: $URL$ ); exercise 15.11 explains exactly how to construct sections with desired vanishing order at some point. This is a consequence of Nadel's theorem applied to singular metrics on ample line bundles; the idea is to impose the metric to have a logarithmic pole at your point, so that Skoda's lemma (the easy part) ensures you that any section of L twisted by the multiplier ideal of the metric has to vanish enough along P. As a consequence, you can deduce Kodaira's embedding theorem. The second reference is the one already mentionned by Donu Arapura. More precisely, there is a lemma in Lazarsfeld' PAG I (edit: Proposition 1.1.31 p.23). It shows how elementary linear algebra (+ RR) can give a lower bound on the vanishing order of some section of a (say nef and big) line bundle with big enough top intersection. 

In general, for any line bundle $L$ over $X$, you have $h^i(X, L^{\otimes n})\leqslant C m^n$ where $m=\dim X$. (write $L$ as the difference of two very ample line bundles, and use the usual restriction exact sequence) In the case where $L$ is nef, then one can say more: $h^i(X,L^{\otimes n})\leqslant C m^{n-i}$ using Fujita's theorem (cf Lazarsfeld, Positivity in Algebraic Geometry, 1.2.29 "growth of cohomology"). But in the case $i=1$, you don't need Fujita, and this can be done more basically. (see e.g Debarre's "Higher dimensional Algebraic Geometry", Proposition 1.31 p21) 

For example, a theorem of Grauert and Röhrl asserts that every holomorphic vector bundle on a non-compact Riemann surface is trivial. You can find this result (and its proof) in the book of O. Forster, Lectures on Riemann Surfaces. 

Another possible approach is the following one, using Abel-Jacobi map : if $g(X)\geq 2$, then Abel-Jacobi map gives an isomorphism $\varphi:Pic^0(X) \simeq \mathbb C^g/\Lambda$ for some lattice $\Lambda$. Now you can translate the map by some point $p\in X$; more precisely, define $\psi(D):=\varphi(D-(p))$ for every divisor $D$ of degree $1$ on $X$. As $g\geq 2$, the image by $\psi$ of all points (seen as degree $1$ divisors) will be one-dimensional inside the $g$-dimensional variety $\mathbb C^g/\Lambda$. Therefore there exist on $X$ (a lot of) divisors of degree $0$ which cannot be written as $(q)-(p)$ for any point $q$. Now consider such a divisor $D$, and define $D'=D+(p)$. It has degree 1, but if it were effective, it would be equivalent to $(q)$ for some point $q\in X$. Therefore one would have $D \sim (q)-(p)$ which is impossible.
