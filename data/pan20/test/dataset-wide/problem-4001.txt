Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $SM$ be the bundle of symmetric bi-linear forms on $TM.$ Riemannian metrics are a particular kind of sections in this bundle. Since any manifold admits a global Riemannian metric it follows that the Euler class of $SM$ is zero. If $M$ is parallelizable then $SM$ is clearly trivial. Are there any manifolds where $SM$ is NOT trivial? 

For a smooth, real surface $\Sigma$, its bundle of symmetric, bi-linear forms $S^2T\Sigma$ reduced to a $PGL(2,\mathbb{R})$ structure. A similar reduction(with different structure group) can be done for other tensor bundles. 

Determine the matrices $S_{ij}$(with real smooth functions as entries) defined by the equation $$ \Omega=\sum_{i<j} (\sigma^i \wedge \sigma^j) S_{ij} .$$ Form the linear system $$ XS_{ij}+S_{ij}^TX=0. $$ If the linear system from the previous step doesn't have a symmetric, positive definite solution $X=A$, the $D$ is not metric. If the solution $X=A$ exists then take its square root $\sqrt{A}=B$. Form the frame $\sigma'$ defined by $$\sigma'=\sigma B$$ and test whether the connection forms with respect to $\sigma'$ are skew. If they are not then the connection is not metric on $U$. If the connection forms with respect to $\sigma$ are skew, then the metric that makes $\sigma$ orthonormal is compatible with the connection. 

A mob is a word used for a topological semigroup which is a Hausdorff space. A clan is a compact connected mob with a two-sided identity element. Who used these words with these meanings first and when? Why were these words chosen? I'm guessing it's a play on "group", but is it really? 

For a semigroup $S$ and a congruence $\rho$ on $S$, let's say that $\rho$ is good when for all $a,b\in S$ we have that $[ab]=[a][b],$ where $[x]$ denotes the congruence class of $x$ modulo $\rho$ and the product on the right-hand side is the product of sets: $AB=\lbrace ab\,|\,a\in A,\ b\in B\rbrace$. What are the semigroups whose all congruences are good? Clearly, we always have $[a][b]\subseteq[ab]$ since if $a\rho x$ and $b\rho y$ then $(ab)\rho (xy)$ by the definition of a congruence. The other inclusion, however, doesn't always hold. Let $S=(\mathbb N,+)$ (with $0$) and let $\rho$ be the congruence modulo $2$. Then $[1+1]=2\mathbb N$ and $[1]+[1]=2\mathbb N\setminus \lbrace0\rbrace.$ It is true for groups though. For if $G$ is a group and $N$ a normal subgroup, then $aNbN=abNN=abN.$ 

MY QUESTION IS: Is anything known about such "directed cages"? Specifically: how many nodes are needed for a directed cage when $r=2$, as a function of $g$? 

Stromquist and Woodall (1985) study the problem of Sets on which several measures agree. There are $n$ non-atomic value measures on the unit circle, and a parameter $w\in(0,1)$. The goal is to find a subset of the circle, whose value according to all $n$ measures is exactly a fraction $w$ of the total. The subset should be a union of a finite number of intervals, and this number should be as small as possible. Denote by $Ints(n,w)$ the smallest number of required intervals. Stromquist and Woodall prove the following bounds on $Ints(n,w)$: 

the square is carved 3 times. The rectangle-numbers are written in each resulting polygon. The final rectangle-number is 6, since $P'$, which is a union of two polygons, can be partitioned to 6 pairwise-disjoint rectangles. Let $R(n)$ be the largest rectangle-number that you can achieve in $n$ carvings. The example above shows that $R(3)\geq 6$. What is an upper bound on $R(n)$? In the example above, each carving adds at most 2 to the rectangle-number. This hints that there may be an upper bound such as $R(n)\leq (2n+1)$, or maybe another linear upper-bound. EDIT: while there are scenarios in which a single carving can double the rectangle-number: 

I believe I've proved that the power semigroup of non-negative integers with addition has a trivial automorphism group. The proof is a bit long, completely elementary and rather unremarkable (as the fact itself probably) so I won't post it here. However, I spent a long time thinking it up. Probably way too long. So I would like to know whether the fact 

Let $(M,\times)$ be a monoid with zero. Let $\Sigma(M,\times)$ be the set of binary operations $+$ on $M$ such that $(M,+,\times)$ is a ring. Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $\Sigma(M,\times)$ defined by $$+_1\sim+_2\iff(M,+_1,\times)\cong(M,+_2,\times).$$ Let's denote the quotient set $\Sigma(M,\times)/\sim$ by $\Sigma'(M,\times)$ and consider the number $$\mathrm{add}(M,\times)=|\Sigma'(M,\times)|.$$ I have several questions about the behavior of this function, none of which I know how to approach. $(1)$ For an integer $n\geq 0$, is there always a monoid $(M,\times)$ such that $n=\mathrm{add}(M,\times)?$ $(2)$ The same question with the requirement that $M$ be finite. $(3)$ The two previous questions are equivalent if $\mathrm{add}(M,\times)\geq\aleph_0$ for $M$ infinite. Is it true? It is false by Todd Trimble's answer. $(\mathbb Z,+)$ with a zero element adjoined is another example. $(4)$ Is there an upper bound to the values of $\mathrm{add}(M,\times)$ over all finite monoids with $0?$ What about all monoids with zero? 

I just found this excellent blog-post: $URL$ It contains a poem on complexity classes, based on Dylan's song "Man gave names to all the animals", with the same tune but different lyrics: 

So the question now becomes: is this always possible to find such $g_1,g_2$ when $f_1,f_2$ are strictly quasiconcave*? Reminder: $f$ is quasiconcave iff $\forall x,y: \forall r\in(0,1): f(r x + (1-r) y)\geq \min(f(x),f(y))$. It is strictly quasiconcave iff $\forall x,y: \forall r\in(0,1): f(r x + (1-r) y)> \min(f(x),f(y))$. 

After reading many papers about problems of minimum polygon covering, I found out that there are four different types of units that are considered for covering polygons, in increasing order of generality: squares, rectangles, convex shapes and star shapes. In theory, there can be many other covering units, for example: it is possible to cover a polygon with triangles (this is different than the problem of triangulation because the units in a covering may overlap), pentagons, hexagons... but, I haven't found any paper discussing such covering problems. My question is: are you aware of any papers discussing the problem of finding a minimum covering of a polygon with shapes other than the four classes above? I am particularly interested in covering a polygon with right-angled isosceles triangles, isolateral triangles or other regular polygons.

I would like to see some (or many!) examples of noncommutative Bezout domains (one-sided principal ideals sum to one-sided principal ideals). I've read somewhere that it's not easy to find an example of a right but not left Bezout domain, but even though I would be glad to see it, I'm actually more interested in examples of domains that are Bezout on both sides. (And of course aren't PIDs.) A Google search gave me nothing, as did a search on this site. 

This might not be common, but it gave me a headache once. I'll delete if it gets heavily downvoted. I once had to think really hard about a contradiction in the great scheme of things that followed from my unwitting assumption that if $f$ was a function from a semigroup to a semigroup, then if its kernel was a congruence, $f$ had to be a homomorphism. I encountered a function whose kernel clearly was a congruence but which clearly wasn't a homomorphism, and it took about an hour's walk in a park for my vague notions and incoherent thought to produce the necessary realization. 

As far as I know, this is an open question. Some information can be found in: Branzei and Nisan (2017), The Query Complexity of Cake Cutting. 

In proportional cake-cutting, there are $n$ agents with equal entitlements to a "cake" (an interval). Each agent $i$ has a nonatomic value measure $V_i$ over the cake, and it is required to create a partition of the cake, $X_1,\dots,X_n$, such that: $$\forall i: {V_i(X_i)\over V_i(Cake)} \geq {1 \over n}$$ It is known that a proportional partition can always be done with $n-1$ cuts, giving each agent a connected piece, e.g. using the last diminisher procedure. In weighted-proportional cake-cutting, the agents have different entitlements. With every agent $i$ is associated an integer weight $p_i$. Let $Q = p_1+\cdots+p_n$; it is required to partition the cake such that: $$\forall i: {V_i(X_i)\over V_i(Cake)} \geq {p_i \over Q}$$ There is a simple but inefficient way to find a weighted-proportional division: 

If $H$ is a chain (each set of $H$ either contains or is contained in any other set of $H$) then $H$ is simple. Proof: Suppose $H\cap g$ contains the set $\{x\}$. Then some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$. Every other set in $H$ either contains $h$ (so it also contains $x$), or is contained in $h$ (so it does not contain $y$). So, $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. More generally, if $H$ is a collection of disjoint chains, then $H$ is simple. The proof is similar: if some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$, then every other set in $H$ either contains $h$ (so it also contains $x$), or is contained in $h$ (so it does not contain $y$) or is disjoint from $h$ (so it contains neither $x$ nor $y$). In all cases $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. More generally, suppose $H$ has the following tree structure: it contains the empty set as the "root"; this root has several children which are singletons; each singleton $\{z\}$ has as children several pairs that contain $z$; and so on. A set is a child of another set if it contains it; there are no intersections between sets except through the edges of the tree. Then, $H$ is simple. Proof: Suppose $H\cap g$ contains the set $\{x\}$. Then some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$. If some other set $h'\in H$ contains $\{x,y\}$, then $h'$ must be a descendant of $h$ in the tree, so there is no other set which contains only $y$, so $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. 

For a connection with "full rank" curvature matrix I think I have a more complete answer in form of an algorithm that verifies whether the connection is metric. This is partly based on an observation made by Robert Bryant so at least that part is 100% correct. Consider a connection $D$ in the vector bundle $E.$ We assume that the curvature matrix has " full rank"(I can elaborate on this condition on the curvature) on a open set $U.$ We'd like to verify if the connection is metric on $U.$ We have the following steps in deciding weather the connection $D$ is metric on $U$: 1.Take a local frame $\sigma=(\sigma_1, \sigma_2,...,\sigma_m )$ on $U$ and calculate the curvature matrix $\Omega$ with respect to this frame. 

Where can I find a good reference on this type of reductions? $PGL(2,\mathbb{R})$ acts by conjugation on the space of square matrices $M(3,\mathbb{R}).$ Can one find any invariant polynomials associated to this action? 

Let $E→M$ be a plane bundle endowed with an almost complex structure $J.$ $J$ induces a natural positive definite inner product in the associated bundle $End(E)→M$,denoted by $<,>$. More precisely if $A,B \in End(E_p)$ then chose a frame $e_1,e_2$ in $E_p$ such that $$ J(e_1)=−e_2, J(e_2)=e_1.$$ This can always be done for an almost complex structure( I believe the name for such a frame is complex frame?). With respect to this frame the matrix of the endomrphism $A$ is $a_{ij}$ and the matrix of $B$ is $b{ij}.$ Define $$<A,B>=\sum_{ij}a_{ij}b_{ij}.$$ Now consider the set $$P=\{(p,A)| p∈M, A∈End(Ep), <A,J>=0, <A,id>=0,<A,A>=1\}$$ which is a circle fibration above $M.$ Are there any conditions on $J$ that will guarantee that $P$ is trivial? 

Let $H$ be a set-family (a set of sets). For every set $g$, define the intersection set-family: $$ H\cap g := \{h\cap g| h\in H \}$$ For every set $g$, the family $H\cap g$ contains at most $2^{|g|}$ sets (the subsets of $g$). Call $H$ simple if, for all two-element sets $g = \{x,y\}$, the family $|H\cap g|$ contains at most $3$ sets. (in other words, $H$ is simple iff its VC dimension is at most $1$). My goal is to characterize the combinatorial structure of simple set-families. I found some sufficient conditions for simplicity of $H$. In all cases, I assume that $g=\{x,y\}$, and prove that $H\cap g$ cannot contain one of the four subsets of $g$. 

So the interesting question is: how to divide the land fairly, such that each state receives only a small number of disconnected pieces? (e.g. a constant, or a function of the number of citizens). Initially I thought of a variant in which only half of the citizens in each state should feel that the division is fair. This makes sense in democratic states, since the suggested division may be brought to a referendum in each state, and if at least half vote in favor of it, it is implemented. Under this assumption, it is possible to divide the land in a single cut (a single piece per state). But this does not generalize well to 3 or more states. 

This is a naive question and I'm afraid it might be better placed on math.se. I would like to leave it to your judgement. I would like to know what is known about sets $A$ of natural numbers such that $A$ contains $0$ and there exists a natural number $n$ such that the sum of $n$ $A$s is a submonoid of $\Bbb N$ or $$\underbrace{A+A+\ldots+A}_{n\text{ times}}=\langle A\rangle,$$ where $\langle A\rangle$ is the semigroup generated by $A.$ Or yet in other words, sets, not necessarily containing $0$, such that it is enough to take sums of their elements of bounded length to already obtain a semigroup. I would prefer not to embarrass myself by trying to say anything about these sets. I'll just ask what known sufficient and necessary conditions for a set to be such there are. And also, is there a name for such sets? 

I thought that was probably it -- it probably came from the perpendicular sides of a carpenter's square. Did it then? And how was it introduced? If this is indeed what's going on, either the meaning must have been introduced long ago, when people still realized what the etymology of "normal" is, or some really erudite mathematician must have introduced it, perhaps to show off their erudition. So how did it happen?
