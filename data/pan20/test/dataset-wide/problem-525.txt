I would add to the above answers that wrist-wrapping is only a palliative; it may relieve the pain temporarily, but almost certainly won't solve the underlying problem. The pain will just come back, and the damage will worsen and become harder to heal. I agree with Batman's suggestion of a bike fitting. Alternative handlebar designs (bullhorns, trekking bars) might also help. 

Touring/trekking/butterfly bars! (Also called "randonneuring" bars, as in a comment above.) All the hand positions ever; set the bar at whatever angle makes you happiest. Here's the set (from Velo Orange) that I'm getting on my new bike: 

Depending on how long it takes before you change helmets, possibly not. My understanding is that even just lying around, the crash-resistant foam in helmets gradually degrades. Five years seems to be a common number, but I don't see any supporting evidence, so take that for the little it's worth. 

Your height might be more challenging to fit than your weight; your weight is well within tolerance for most bikes, steel or aluminum. Don't buy a too-big bike; it'll make you unhappy and might even cause injury. Especially at first while you're still getting used to cycling, you will likely be more comfortable with a fairly upright position in the saddle. (I certainly was!) This suggests a couple of classes of bike to look at: 

I've never heard of this being a problem for anyone... but I admittedly stick to the more upright-seated end of the bicycle continuum. I suggest you try before you buy, of course, but you may also wish to look for a bike with a longer stem, so that if you find you have this trouble, you can raise your handlebars. Cyclocross bikes should actually be a bit more forgiving of an upright stance than straight-up roadbikes. 

You may well know this already, but if you're cycling in street shoes, the style of shoe you wear makes a difference to the kind of pedal you'll put up with. This matters most with thin-soled shoes (e.g. dress shoes, any gender) and very soft-soled/bendy shoes. If you wear clogs, or sneakers/trainers, or thick-soled Keens, or real cycling shoes? Honestly, you have more choices. I tend to wear soft-soled shoes (because Whiny Princess Feet, trust me, you don't want to know). I had VO City Pedals on my bike, which have the same squarish crenellations as the VO Touring pedals pictured above, and those just bit into my soles until I could stand it no more, especially with their relatively small size making them hit my arches rather than the tougher ball of my foot... ... whereupon I bought MKS Lambda pedals that I love to bits and pieces; the larger contact area suits me great, and the roundish bas-relief grippy bits don't cause me pain. Moral of the story: test pedals with the shoes you'll ride in -- ALL the shoes you'll ride in, preferably. It may mean you compromise a bit, but that's livable. 

Being of the female persuasion, I sometimes bring a maxi dress in a lightweight fabric that I can throw on over cycling gear. I bike in Keen sandals, which are good enough for casual restaurants. I've found that many restaurants near a bike trail are used to it, even appreciate bikers as customers. (Shout-out to the Grumpy Troll in Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin!) 

Bikeshare bikes are beasts, and their geometry (long wheelbases, particularly) is such that I wouldn't think 15 pounds in front appreciably changes the steering. My concern -- the picture isn't clear on this point -- is whether the bag can be secured in place so that it doesn't slide out. My messenger bag sometimes gets loaded unevenly (books!), which could increase the chances it would fall out. Heat is another consideration, especially given that hill. Messenger bags on your back hold in the heat! Hill might not be any harder that way, but it'll likely FEEL sweatier and more difficult. 

Would making more noise (without being obnoxiously loud) be an answer? Constantly twiddling a bike bell would be distracting, but a few jingle bells you could hang on your bike or gear might help alert the critters that you're coming. 

Depending on the urban-ness of your area, there may be local "bike swap" events once or twice a year. If you really have a lot to get rid of, this could be one way to get it in front of the right people. 

I concur with PeteH's answer, with the caveat that local bike cultures, and certainly individual bike shops, can sometimes skew heavily in the direction of a specific kind of riding or a specific kind of rider... who may not be you. So it's completely fine to walk out of a local bike shop that treats you like something you'd scrape off the bottom of your shoe, and also completely fine to go to a larger store if that's where they'll actually listen to you and honestly try to help. One way to find the right place to shop is to ask a rider you know who does the same sort of riding you want to do where s/he buys gear locally. I don't know any cyclist who would refuse to answer! 

An odd possibility, but it happened to me... does your foldie have a kickstand? If so, any chance that your crank is hitting it while you pedal? Fix for me, once I figured out the problem, was obvious and simple: put kickstand up, push it in toward frame, tighten it down with hex wrench. 

As a female bike commuter, I find that shoes with a low chunky heel, something like this, work rather similarly to toe clips, keeping my foot on the pedal without me having to work at it. That said, my next bike will probably have toe clips... it's possible to find tallish ones that will take street shoes well. 

though many "hybrid" or "city" bikes (look for the flat handlebars) would do you fine as well. What you absolutely won't want is an aggressive road bike with skinny tires and drop handlebars. I won't say you absolutely have to get a step-through/mixte bike, but I do think you'll find them easier to deal with than the standard swing-a-leg-over diamond frame. Manufacturers with bikes I think you'd enjoy include Electra, Civia, and Linus. Welcome to cycling! 

The kind of biking you do is exactly the kind of biking I do. I was once a devotee of the Cult of Saddle Cushioning as well. I was wrong. Painfully, chafingly so. Ow. You don't want the gel. You don't want lots of cushioning. What you probably do want is springs (saddle suspension) and perhaps something a bit wider in back than your typical Lycra Laddish roadie thing. You may also want to invest in bike shorts with a good chamois. You definitely want to invest in a decent skin-lubricating cream (hunt around here; several posts on that). I splurged on a Brooks leather saddle for my tourer, and while I'm still breaking it in, I can already tell it's a much better ride than the cushion-packed saddle I replaced. If Brooks is too pricey, but you still want leather, Velo-Orange has some less-expensive ones (though caveat emptor: I've seen some poor reviews). 

I actually have a VO Grand Cru stem angled back toward me. With the trekking bars, it works for my modest mostly-upright-posture purposes. No effect on bike handling that I can tell. If I get a yen to lean further forward someday (unlikely, with my middle-aged back) I'll flip it. Adjustable stems can also be persuaded to do this. So it's possible, just not common. 

(United States road configuration and customs here. Sorry, those of you who drive on the left!) On my trip home, I use a bike lane near the right side of a very busy one-way arterial street; there is a bus/right-turn lane between the bike lane and the curb. I need to turn left, crossing three lanes of traffic, at a T-intersection (no street to the right). My options are: 

I think I may have worked out what was doing it. I don't "ankle" (see Sheldon Brown) while pedaling, but while coasting I unconsciously point my toes downward on the extended leg, which seems to have led to the same symptoms. I'm making myself flex my foot at the ankle while coasting instead, and so far so good. Gearing down and pedaling faster has made some difference also. 

Pull off the road sooner. Sure, you have a right to be there, but it was quite clear that this creep wasn't prepared to accept that. Your safety is more important than taking the lane. Noting his license-plate number and car make/model as he vanishes into the distance isn't a bad idea either, in case you see him again. 

I put blinkies on my panniers (there's a little strap thing on them for that purpose), so if I'm only running one, I put it on the left partly so that the blinky blinks at traffic. 

Did you by any chance inflate the tire right before your ride? Sounds like a delayed-reaction blowout. (If so, I wince in sympathy -- same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago.) If you had a longish rip in the inner tube rather than a small hole or pair of holes, that's likely a blowout from overinflation. 

US bicycle brands that offer bikes of this sort include Electra (Amsterdam, perhaps the Townie), Civia (Twin City), Linus (Dutchi, perhaps the Mixte), Breezer, and Public (mixte and step-through models). Trek made one called the Belleville that was discontinued (it was a heavy and inflexible beast; I considered buying one) but might still be available used. In the UK, Pashley makes several models of Dutch bike (e.g. the Princess and Roadster models). A few US distributors will import a Pashley, I believe. 

Do not mock. Do not mock others' choice of bicycle, bicycle color, bicycle accessory, or bicycle decoration. Do not mock others' choice of clothing, or how they look in it. Do not mock others' speed, or lack of it. Do not mock others' helmet, or lack thereof. Do not mock others' comfort level with bicycle repair. Do not mock any cycling-etiquette faux pas you see. Do not mock others' weight or fitness level. Obvious safety issues, sure, bring it up, nobody wants a friend or family member hurt -- but discuss it without sarcasm or snobbery. This goes beyond making sure you don't specifically alienate the person you're trying to convince, though that is certainly a consideration. It's more generalized than that: mocking third parties makes non-cyclists believe they'll just be somebody else's meanness target if they start cycling. Instead, you want to establish that cycling is a pursuit with an accepting, welcoming, helpful community. You want your friends or family members to believe that if they start cycling, they're not letting themselves in for a whole bunch of grief. I've broken these rules myself, and always regretted it. Please do better than I have. 

I have a pair of these from Sierra Trading Post: $URL$ The reflective strip is wide and works as advertised. If you're biking in cold weather (I'm a Sconnie, so "cold" to me is "25F or below"), I recommend glove liners and/or wristbands; these gloves are a bit drafty. 

Overinflation blowout is a possibility; I had that happen with Schwalbe Marathons, don't recall the exact PSI but it was the tire's rated max. Try 10 under the max; if that does okay, then maybe push it a little further. 

I'm about your weight. I've ridden an off-the-rack aluminum step-through (Electra Townie, specifically) and a custom steel tourer (also a step-through) and both have served me well. (Step-through frames are not as intrinsically strong as diamond frames; I once read a cycling how-to book that utterly dismissed step-throughs on that sole basis. Whatevs. When that author rides to work in a dress on his diamond-frame bike, he can criticize my step-throughs.) I can't speak to carbon fiber or titanium or exotic frame materials like bamboo, however. Basically, I concur that you'll be fine. The only thing I'd warn you about based on my own experience is tightening your seatpost clamp; I've had seatposts decide to lower themselves, particularly after bumpy bits of trail. Do also remember to loosen the clamp and move the seatpost every once in a while, so they don't end up forever stuck in place. Potential bonus: I have never, not even once, been street-hassled over my weight while on a bike. (It's happened while I was a pedestrian, many a time.) I cannot entirely explain this -- it may partly be my penchant for interesting-looking and extremely purple bikes -- but I'm not complaining!
