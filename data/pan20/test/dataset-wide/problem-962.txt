Many possible mechanisms can create temperature fluctuations on the scale of an hour or two. First there is the met site itself. Are there trees or buildings that could provide partial shade, especially when the sun is low in the sky? Are there buildings that could reflect sunlight directly onto the instrumentation? Then there are local anomalies. Are there gully winds? Do cloud banks form in the mornings, or high cumulus towers build up in the afternoons (quite common in the Western Ghats of India)? Is there a local temperature inversion, and does it disperse daily? What kind of local wind patterns are there? Is there a lake nearby that could create local cooling if the winds are in the right direction? Conversely, is there a source of local heat anomalies - factories, power stations? On the larger scale, what is the area topography, and what local air circulation does it create? Is there some interaction between monsoonal air flow and continental air masses? What turbulence does this create? Some bizarre anomalies are also possible, like birds roosting on the instrumentation! Really, there is no short-cut answer. The only solution is to go there with an unbiased and inquiring mind, and check out what's going on. I'm guessing that for such a consistent fluctuation it will be something obvious. 

As Jan points out, there are many other factors in the oxygen balance, not just trees. But for a bit of fun, let us suppose that we burn all the trees on the planet. The global biomass of carbon is estimated as 47.4 PgC (it varies a bit according to season and inter-annual growth conditions). Of this we can estimate that the contribution from trees is about 36.3 PgC. 1 tonne of carbon consumes 2.67 tonnes of oxygen to create CO2, so the oxygen consumed is about 9.68 x 10^^10 tonnes. The total mass of the atmosphere is known to be 5.15 Petatonnes, of which oxygen is 20.95%, or 1.08 Petatonnes of oxygen. So taking the ratio, the loss of atmospheric oxygen from burning all the trees is 0.0034%. This is far less than the day-to-day fluctuations in available oxygen due to changes in atmospheric pressure - i.e. the weather. So, there is a lot of woody biomass, but think of the partial pressure of the oxygen layer that wraps the Earth: 21.2 kPa O2 on every square centimetre of the Earth's surface. We are never going to run out of oxygen! On the other hand, pyrolysis of every tree on the planet would create so much smoke that we would probably all die of lung cancer! 

There are many generalized references, such as $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ But I think the best is Kerry Emmanuel's presentation: $URL$ Is this sufficient detail for you? If not, then you probably need to do a course in tropical meteorology. 

Michael is correct. SIAL and SIMA are very vague and over-simplified summaries of the continental and oceanic crustal compositions. These terms may be OK for school introductions to geology, but you don't have to look far to find many exceptions. There are eroded and fragmented continental remnants, of nominally SIALic composition, in every ocean. Indeed, 100% oceanic crust may include small amounts of highly differentiated plagiogranite (technically SIALic in composition). Then there are bits of oceanic crust, called ophiolites (SIMA) incorporated into continental crust through processes of obduction and terrain accretion, not to mention the many flood basalt terrains (SIMA), which can occur on either continental or oceanic crust. Whether crust is oceanic or continental is a matter of overall rock density, composition and crustal thickness. 

The Earth has a 4.6 billion year history involving proto-planet collision, meteorite bombardment during the Hadean Era, and an early molten phase when massive scale differentiation took place. We have good reason to believe that the earliest rocks, from which the Earth was formed by accretion, were meteorite in composition . Many of these are stony meteorites containing 'chondrules', i.e. millimetre-sized spherical droplets which were flash melted to more than 1500 deg C, probably by being 'cooked' in close proximity to a supernova explosion. These chondrules were probably formed one or two million years before being incorporated into the rocky meteorites where we now find them. Therefore, I would nominate these as being the first known rocks of the terrestrial rock cycle. 

Over the 4.6 billion years of the Earth's evolution, so far, the inner/outer core interface has "cooled" to a mere 6000 deg C. Of course, other things being equal, the core will contract as it cools, but the rate of cooling will be massively delayed by the slow radioactive decay of uranium 235, U 238 and Thorium. Delayed, in fact by many more billion years. The mantle will cool with it, and being plastic, will deform to take up the space of the thermal contraction. However, by the time the radioactive heating decays to much lesser values, the sun will have blown up into the red giant phase. Even if the Earth is not actually engulfed by the expanded sun, it will be so heated that the oceans, and more volatile fractions of the crust will have boiled off into space, to become part of the enhanced solar wind. If we assume that the Earth's core will eventually cool by 4000 deg C, then Earth will eventually have a reduction in radius of about 10 km (my very rough back of an envelope calculation) from thermal contraction alone. How much of the surface will have boiled off into space by then is anybody's guess. 

A normal single arc rainbow is caused when sunlight enters a raindrop with a light-path refracted>reflected>refracted. A double rainbow occurs when sunlight hits a part of the raindrop at a different angle of incidence, at which the light-path is refracted>reflected>reflected>refracted. Some energy is lost with each reflection, so the double internal reflection emerges as less bright than the primary arc. Also, because there is another internal reflection the colours are inverted. So every rainbow has a primary and seconday arc. Hence the question becomes: 'Is the observer in a position to see the secondary arc', which is a matter of geometry between the sun, raindrop and observer. So the answer to your question is 'no', it isn't rare at all, in fact a secondary arc is always present somewhere, but is not always visible to the observer for reasons of geometry and background light intensity.
