There are many different kinds of time travel; as you've eliminated multiple-universe or abandoned-timeline, you're really only left with only two options: 1) Fate. Everything happens the way it happens because that's how it was scripted; you don't prevent your birth by disturbing the air, you cause your birth by disturbing the air. Time is lock-step, and there is no way to mess things up. Or fix things, for that matter. No paradoxes are formed, because it's simply impossible. See "All You Zombies" by Robert A. Heinlein. 2) Paradox armor. Maybe timelines are fluid after all, but temporal paradoxes effectively destroy the universe; you go back in time and prevent your own birth, which means you're not around to prevent your own birth, which means... To keep from getting stuck in a loop, paradoxes resolve as a force; the closer you are to breaking the universe, the harder it is to do. You might have meant to appear in your parents bedroom, but a fluke causes you to appear 15 minutes too late, or a few feet too far away. The bigger the disruption and/or the closer you get to disrupting time, the more flukes show up, making actual disruption of a timeline completely impossible. Now, there is one other type of time travel available: Hollywood time-travel. 3) In some instances of Hollywood time-travel, changes propagate slowly, "catching up" to "current time" like in Back to the Future, or changes skip causality all together, like in "Looper", happening immediately, but without actually changing any events between. The second case works out the best for you - you'll still be you, with your same memories, just in a different body (how different depends on how much the timeline was changed). However, in each of these cases, paradoxes become merely plot-holes. The science is lazily hand-waved away. Good news! It's impossible to send you back to stop your own birth. In the case of #1, you cause, not prevent, your birth. In the case of #2, you simply cannot change the past; your enemy will send you back to the wrong time and/or place, no matter what. In the case of #3, you will succeed or fail, depending on what the plot requires of you, regardless of your actions or those of your enemy. Time travel aside, air is very lightly packed; a human will react to sights or sounds long before air has enough force to move the human body enough to make a difference. Close to the moment, don't land where your parents can see or hear you, and you'll be fine. Anything more would be so difficult to calculate that your enemy wouldn't bother - just send something else back, like a blaring air horn. 

Free-motion wheels This option is fairly possible, though would result in some strange creatures (see diagram). The actual drive system could be legs, claws, or even a slithering motion; the wheels would simply reduce sliding friction, and possibly remove the creature from a dangerous environment, like caustic or hot surfaces. The creature would need a fixed bone that protrudes from each side. The bone would terminate in a sphere. An organ just above the bone would excrete a cementing substance, similar to the oyster's pearl-forming system. It would coat the sphere, gradually growing larger. The sphere (and attached bone) would excrete a lubricating liquid that would also keep the area clean. Here is a creature, viewed from the front (so cute!): 

The first thing to go is always your memory... Cold storage Cool, dry conditions that preserve a computer at least well enough to prevent corrosion and physical damage are a must. In damp or otherwise corrosive conditions, a computer may not last a year; delicate wiring can very quickly decay, especially if there is no moving air to limit humidity inside the case. Temperature can also play a key role; too wide of a range or too rapid of change can stress physical components. If the computer is in a moderately stable environment, above 50 and below 110 degrees Fahrenheit, it has the best chance of lasting a long time. Sunlight - or even low ambient light - can destroy almost every part of a computer, so it should be stored somewhere out of the light. If a computer isn't stored somewhere cool, dry, dark, and free of vibrations, expect it to last a few years; the worse the conditions, the lower the lifespan. Memory, Sweet Memory Regardless of storage medium, duplicate data will mean a much higher chance of being able to boot up successfully. A standard mirrored RAID can extend the lifespan of a drive (assuming it works) by many years. The more duplicates, the higher the chance the data will survive intact, possibly even doubling or tripling the lifespan. 

I suggest a carrot, a stick, and a warning system. Carrot People to live on the planet will be housed in immense domes, camouflaged to resemble the surrounding area, and outfitted lavishly. Further, the housing will extend underground; both the domes and the underground areas are shielded with Faraday cages, which eliminates accidental radio transmission. Landing areas must all be equipped with a high-power (non-destructive) laser; this laser will target ships and act as a communication line. It will slave the ship to the landing system, which includes entirely disabling the radio system. Stick Throughout the system, self-propelled satellites will monitor for radio, laser, and other transmissions. Any transmission above radio silent operation will be immediately targeted and destroyed. Similarly, any ships on approach (and thus slaved to the landing area) diverting from the slave lock will result in their immediate destruction. Since you are already in the system "illegally", destroying incoming ships is not going to get you in any more trouble than before. Finally, satellites above the planet will monitor for any radio signals and, once detected, will destroy the transmitter. Every satellite will be disguised to prevent detection, so there will be no worry of one being discovered accidentally. Warning system It is impossible to completely stop the transmission of radio signals, barring time travel, which is an expensive and paradox-filled package. Once radio signals are detected, there is no way to keep them from leaving the system. Worse, any ship in the system can broadcast; or, if that isn't enough, a ship lightyears away from the system could broadcast a signal past (or in front of) the system to make it look as if the signal came from that system. There is no way to stop signals. If someone wanted to bring death and destruction, they could do it, and you would have absolutely no way to stop it - or even detect it, if it was outside the system. However, radio waves are slow-moving, comparatively; it takes 5 hours for a radio link to reach Pluto from Earth, which means the residents of the system will have at least some time to hide. The moment a radio transmission is detected, its source will be destroyed, and the warning system will (via laser communication) warn every habitation. Each habitation will be stocked with single-use "flee ships", designed to exit the planet's gravity field and be picked up by a disguised rescue ship - the survivors will be planet-less again, but at least will have their lives. 

There is a possibility: the material is too pure. Some materials, like diamond, end up 100% pure due to their molecular structure. While flawed diamond exist (and can have more value than flawless diamonds), flawless diamonds exist in nature. However, trying to sell a flawless diamond the size of a small car is a pretty good pointer that something is wrong. It's possible for a diamond that size to occur in nature, but not very likely. Similarly, some metals are very difficult to purify; while 99.999% pure gold is available, truly 100% pure gold is almost impossible to achieve. Any reactive element with 100% purity, especially a large amount, should be suspect. Also, while various materials have a very regimented structure, others are fairly random. Crystals tend towards simple mathematical forms - straight rows, hexagonal shapes, etc. Other materials, especially materials with large molecules like plastics, have an almost random internal structure. Organic or complex materials with simple patterns may be suspect. Finally, manufacturing atoms may result in some unwanted atoms being formed by accident, or as waste; while finding a small amount of silver in gold bullion can be expected, finding lawrencium would be very out of place. Finding uranium in glass, argon bubbles in ice, or helium in steel would all make very little sense, and could point to the material being manufactured in strange ways. 

For covert communication, signed "hytes" (hand bytes) would not only be easy to learn quickly, but could be expanded to include written signs, too. A hand sign, from thumb to pinky, for example, may be up-up-down-up-down. It could also be written !!.!. or 11010. A single hand, using two-position fingers, would communicate up to 32 different signs. Using three-position signs results in 243 signs! Adding hand up/down/sideways and facing/reversed multiplies the total by six. Obviously, other methods of "count-signing" could be used, like joint counting, pointing at various locations (ear, nose, etc.), or even tapping, or a combination of all of the above. 

Third, prepare the ambush. Find an area you know the enemy will be marching through. You'll need about four hours to prepare. If you skip the trapdoor holes, you could probably get ready in as little as an hour if you have the materials available. Dig shallow holes in a field, glade, valley, or flat area, enough for approximately half your group; each hole should have a wooden cover and enough dirt and grass to hide it. Place one man in each hole and cover it up. Then, spread a mixture of dry grass, dry leaves, and fuel made from animal fat over the field, careful not to get any near the trap doors. Added bonuses would be "rocks" made from balls of pitch and flour, wax, or even pinecones - anything that burns hot, bright, and/or with lots of smoke. Fourth... wait. When the army approaches, with just a few well-placed touches from hidden torches, the field becomes a wall of fire. The dry grass burns quickly, lighting the animal fats and pitch; it will also create clouds of smoke. Once the enemy is distracted by the flames, attack with the Fire and Smoke warriors, pushing the enemy back into the flames. Finally, once the flames begin to die down, the Ash warriors under the trapdoors can leap out and join the fight. Once the fight is over, burn any evidence, including bodies; leave nothing but ash. "Bored from our long march, we were glad of the soft grass beneath our feet. Suddenly, someone at the edge of the field began shouting - fire! Faster than a thought, the dry grass at our feet burst into flame! At first, we tried to stomp it out, but it spread faster and hotter than we could bear, and the field was soon a burning inferno! I had barely scrambled to the edge of the field when I saw the first of the demons, huge creatures with blackened faces, wreathed in flames, swinging burning brands, and screaming in an unearthly voice! I dove to the ground and lay as one dead as the demons cut through my comrades. The demons drove my countrymen back into the fire, laughing at the screams of the dying. For a brief moment, I found hope as our soldiers pushed the hellspawn back, but suddenly the very earth beneath our feet broke open, and warriors of smoke and ash leaped forth! I ran, somehow escaping in the chaos, but I was the only one; the rest were dragged down to hell. When I returned, hoping to find survivors, there was nothing left but ash and bones..."
