If you plug in your numbers, that gives a semimajor axis of 312500 km. If you want your moon to be closer and still revolve around the planet every 20 days, you need to lower the combined mass of the two bodies. The thing is, as you see, the orbital period is proportional to the cube root of the masses, so anything but a large decrease will make almost no difference. For example, if your planet had 50% of Earth's mass, the orbital radius of the moon would be 249030 km. If you want to have a large moon close to a large planet, you have to have a fast moon. If you achieve that, more forceful tides will follow as a natural consequence. For example, with a period of 3.5 days your moon will be at about a quarter of the Earth-Moon distance from the planet. That would mean extremely strong tides, though (check out this answer for the calculations). Your planet can rotate around its axis at pretty much any reasonable rate (26 hours is perfectly reasonable). The mass and distance of the moon are irrelevant in principle. Of course, a large moon on a close orbit will suffer a lot of tidal acceleration and as a result both the moon and the planet will tend to rotate more slowly and to get away from each other over geological timescales. 

Summarizing, mostly: we are an extremely young technological civilization, so anything that finds us should statistically be a lot more advanced. Suppose life appeared in many planets at roughly the same time and also evolved toward intelligence and interstellar travel capability at roughly the same rate. There have been primates for about 50 million years. Suppose in an almost-exact copy of Earth a species had evolved from the first primate at a rate 0.01% faster than ours. That would mean a 5000-year head start by now. These alternative Homo sapiens would have been developing nuclear weapons and landing on their Moon at aroud the same time our ancestors were building Stonehenge. And the whole scenario is of course wildly unrealistic. The idea that "life is easy" is misleading. Life might appear easily, but there's no guarantee that it will endure, and in any case most experts think that the predominant kind of life in the universe must be microscopic. If intelligent life were so common, we'd be finding signs of it all over (see Fermi paradox) unless all intelligent life, by an incredible coincidence, was just a bit less advanced than us or had a bad case of paranoia that led it to avoid all contact with the rest of the universe and to erase all traces of its presence. Also, neither biological evolution nor technological progress work linearly or predictably. It makes no sense speaking of an alien species being n times more advanced. How do you measure that? There are things like the Kardashev scale, for sure, that attempt to measure technological advancement by isolating one variable (in this case, the amount of energy employed for communication), but that's it. There's no guarantee that, if FTL is possible (to name one of the key technologies needed to go out and conquer SPACE!!!), then all technological species will be able to discover it. It may be that FTL depends on mastering states of matter only readily found near the cores of giant planets. It may be that you can only construct an FTL engine near a neutron star or black hole, and only civilizations living close to one of them will ever make the jump. In many commercial science-fiction scenarios you have advanced aliens laying waste to Earth (or to human colonies) thanks to superior technology, and Earthlings doing their best to resist and ultimately fighting back. In more realistic scenarios humanity would not only not have a chance, but probably wouldn't even know what hit it. If you can master FTL travel for big ships, or even NAFAL interstellar travel, then you can produce, control and direct huge amounts of energy: more than enough to reduce Earth's biosphere to ash from a good distance. 

Maybe not in a few days, but: you could give nuclear scientists the recipe for a transuranian element on an island of stability: a superheavy isotope of a new element that is stable (i. e. it doesn't decay) in the order of a few minutes or hours. This need not require extremely strong energies, maybe only tuning some reactions that have already been tried before: 

A lot of the light coming from the Red Sun will be in the red and infrared part of the spectrum. Chlorophyll is rather good at catching red photons, surprisingly, but it will probably not be enough. The experts say that under two different suns it's likely plants will evolve to use one type of light or the other. But with a third of their usable energy coming from the Red Sun, I'd guess plants on the Red-Sun hemisphere will not miss that; they might conceivably use something like chlorophyll during the Yellow day and a different pigment at night. 

Massive tides that come at random every few years, let alone every few centuries, are not feasible. Your moon rotates, and the tidal bulge rotates with it, so tides should come in cycles that last in the order of one day or half a day or a quarter of a day. If the moon's orbit around the gas giant is very excentric, tides will be much stronger near periastron (the moment of closest approach), but still easily noted as periodic events. Moons don't commonly have orbital periods in the order of years. A possible model for you would be Neso, which orbits Neptune every 27 years and has an excentricity of 0.57. 

I cannot speak for the rest, but the reimagined Battlestar Galactica has ships which jump from one point of space to another; though this is called FTL, it's not really accelerating beyond light speed. BSG also has artificial gravity as a matter of course, but how it's generated is never explained, nor is it explicitly related to FTL. In BSG we do not see "jumps" employed as weapons per se, but the destructive capability of jumps is shown at least twice (once when a Viper jumps away from a point too close to Galactica, the other when a whole group of Raptors jump away from inside one of Galactica's flight pods). We don't know if jumping close to some object causes damage to that object; we do know that it's possible to jump into some other object, which presumably would disturb it. The reason why jumping is not employed as a weapon is, I think, that it would require the jump coordinates to be calculated very fast, which is plainly not what happens in BSG, or the target must be rather large or stay immobile. It would also require to sacrifice an FTL drive, which is probably not cheap. You can do much more damage with a nuke at close range, even if you have to launch a dozen to get one hit. It shouldn't be that difficult, though, to mount a nuke inside an FTL-enabled unmanned ship and jump that into an enemy base, for example, unless FTL jumps can be impeded by some shield or barrier, which we don't know for certain. 

It's not really that easy to kill yourself. Unless they have severe depression or the like, even under extreme stress people would rather try to stay alive. It's not easy to kill yourself unless you have the appropriate tools (such as a sharp knife or a gun), which your captors would not let near you in any case. You can kill yourself using your own hands, possibly, or a pointed stone, but most people could not make it to the end. People form bonds and often end up adapting to appalling living conditions. If you kill yourself you could end up in far worse company. I mean, really: most people on Earth believe when they die they'll be in a better place, yet they don't kill themselves, mostly. 

Most of the answers until now have focused on biology/evolution, even though you asked about cultural implications. One of them would be that all reference points would be, of necessity, local. Each place on the infinite Earth-plane could and would probably be considered as the center of the universe (figuratively and/or literally) by its inhabitants. You haven't specified how this flat Earth would be lit, but a single sun (or light source of any kind) could never be enough, so there must be either some kind of luminous sky or multiple suns revolving "up there", for example. In any case there would be no north, south, east or west. Navigation would have to be done using notable local landmarks such as mountain peaks. In a flat plane the "horizon" would not exist; things would just appear to become infinitesimally small in the distance, in a clear day, or obscured by air itself (no mixture of gases is perfectly transparent), so people who happened to live in a place with no great mountains around would effectively lack all navigational clues. Religion and science would include these things in their paradigms. They would have to cope with infinity. Some could imagine that reality must be finite and therefore everything outside a given radius from the local origin is an illusion. Legends could be common about some adventurer or prophet who travelled to the end of the real world and came back.
