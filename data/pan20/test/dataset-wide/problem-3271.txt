Ever since Larson (1988) 'shell theory' of phrase structure (a two-layered X-bar theory, at the time) became popular, in Chomskian grammars (P&PT and then 'minimalist' ones) there has been a growing tendency, which eventually became standard doctrine, to place both arguments and adjuncts in specifier positions. This conception has come to be known as the 'all-in-spec hypothesis', and its consequence is that adjunction is no longer a constructional option: all earlier 'adjuncts' (broadly: 'modifiers', including AdvPs, PPs, APs, Rel-Clauses, etc.) have been reanalysed as specifiers of 'something'. Of course, that would not have been possible without the wild proliferation of 'functional' categories in such influential works as Cinque's "Adverbs and Functional Heads" (OUP, 1999) and subsequent 'cartographic' work since. The 'all-in-spec hypothesis' further reduced the constructional machinery of the Language Faculty in comparison with X-bar theory, and, in retrospect, was a crucial step towards the current minimalist doctrine that the FL contains only (recursive) Merge (with Move[ment] reanalysed as internal Merge and NO X-bar principles). From a minimalist point of view ('less is more/better'), therefore, dispensing with all adjunction simplified the theory, but, of course, it did so at a price, and there are good reasons to be sceptical. First, since arguments and 'modifiers' have completely different semantic types (modifiers are second or higher-order predicates - i.e., 'functions', in Fregean-Montagovian terms - whereas arguments are referring expressions - and 'objects', in Frege's sense - cancelling the long-established structural distinction between complements and adjuncts is at best a questionable move and a serious blow to the broadly accepted requirement of a transparent correlation between semantics and syntax. Secondly, and, in my view, above all, a 'specifier of x' is only as credible as the specified head 'x' itself is, and, simply, in too many cases, the ontological and semantic status of the specified 'x' heads has remained dubious or completely undefined. As to the specific example you are interested in, since the head (= to) of the PP to bed, as in e.g., I went straight to bed, is monadic and the only argument it requires is satisfied by bed in Comp P position, the specifier of P is empty and, apparently, there is no reason why it should not be filled by the P-modifier/adjunct straight, as you say Radford claims, but that 'solution' cannot be generalised to all PPs: in cases like The bomb was right in the middle of Trafalgar Square, the preposition in is dyadic, and, according to the 'XP-Internal Subject Hypothesis' of modern Chomskian grammars, its higher argument (= the bomb) must itself be base-generated in Spec P, which, obviously, prevents right from appearing in that position. What position, then, does the 'adverb' right occupy in such cases? At first blush there seems to be only one option: right must be adjoined to the P' in the middle of Trafalgar Square and leave Spec P empty to lodge the higher argument of the preposition in (= the bomb), which entails that 'adjunction' (to X', not to XP) cannot be dispensed with, after all. A minimalist way out of this 'cul de sac', however, would be to claim that above the PP [the bomb [in the middle of Trafalgar Square]] there is another XP headed by an empty functional category 'x' (whose categorial and semantic properties must still be defined) which takes the PP as a complement (= Comp x) and the 'adverb' right as its specifier (= Spec x). Of course, that 'solution' would be compatible with minimalist grammars to the extent that functional categories (= 'x', here) can be more or less freely postulated in them, but its credibility would depend on how ontologically and semantically plausible that new functional head itself turned out to be. To my knowledge, the 'x' presumably specified by right (or straight, for that matter) in such examples has never been clearly specified. As to your final question, in Chomskian linguistics all 'modifiers' must be treated alike, a) either as 'adjuncts' of X' (= N', V', A', P', etc., but not NP, VP, AP or PP!), in early theories that preserve adjunction, or b) as specifiers of the corresponding hypothetical 'x' heads, in later minimalist ones. Adjunction of YP to XP, although briefly entertained as a solution to the adjunction problem between the GB and the early P&PT period, has, to my knowledge, been completely dismissed in subsequent work. Leaving aside theory-internal reasons, that operation has always raised a serious theory-neutral semantic objection: if both XP and YP are 'saturated' (= maximal projections), then, neither can take the other as an argument. Since adjuncts are interpreted as higher-order predicates of their heads, a) YP cannot be a maximal projection (= an YP) if XP functions as its argument, and b) if YP is a higher-order predicate, then XP should always be a first- or lower order predicate. Condition a) by itself already blocks all YP-to-XP adjunctions; condition b) excludes any adjunction of APs, PPs, etc. to NPs/DPs like the book, which, obviously, are not predicates. Finally, Spec NP is NOT needed to lodge determiners. That was true until about 1986, but ever since Abney's MIT thesis (1987) forcefully defended the 'DetP hypothesis', all Chomskian syntacticians base-generate determiners outside, and above, the NP (in DP). As to the Spec NP, at 'initial (roughly = deep) structure' it is either empty or filled by N's highest argument, but not by adjectives, with one possible exception (although, in this respect, there is no consensus): Spec N can arguably be filled by an adjective when the adjective is broadly equivalent in meaning to the highest argument of N and alternates, but does not co-occur, with it, as in e.g. [the [American invasion of Iraq]], where American arguably plays the Agent role of invasion, vs. * [The Americans' [American invasion of Iraq], or * [the [American invasion of Iraq by the Americans]], where the adjective does not alternate, but co-occurs, with the real Agent, the Americans, either in Spec N (N = invasion) and then in Spec D (D = the), or in the 'agentive' [by + DP] phrase after invasion of Iraq). 

Although the diagramming issue has long ceased to be an important topic of discussion or research (after all, you can easily 'translate' labelled brackets, trees, boxes, relational igloos, feature structures, relations, functions, etc. into each other and find ways to prove that they are mathematically equivalent), I think you could still benefit from reading at least the following (oldish) books: Edith A. Moravcsik & Jessica Wirth, eds., 'Current Approaches to Syntax'(Syntax and Semantics volume 13), New York, Academic Press 1980. (With info on practically all approaches to syntax still alive ca. 1980) Peter Sells, 'Lectures on Contemporary Syntactic Theories', Stanford, CSLI, 1985 (good for GB vs. LFG and GPSG) Stuart M. Shieber, 'An Introduction to Unification-Based Approaches to Grammar' (CSLI Lecture Notes, 4), Stanford, CSLI, 1986. (good for LFG, GPSG, HPSG) Giorgio Graffi, '200 Years of Syntax. A Critical Survey', Amsterdam & Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2001. (A generally informative overview of syntactic theory and analytical techniques, including diagramming, since the early 19th c. to the late 1990's). Good luck! S. 

As I explained in my answer to another question of yours, the 'association' between 'dummies' and their 'associates' is chain-formation: 'dummy it' a) has no valued Thematic role feature, but b) it has a valued Category feature(= CP), c) a valued Case feature (nominative, when it occurs in subject position, objective, as in I expect it to be clear that I am just a beginner, or oblique, as in You can depend on it that I mean no harm at all), and d) a valued Number feature (always singular), so its associate must be an argument with 1) a valued theta role feature, 2) a valued (and compatible!) Category feature (= CP), 3) a compatible Number feature (= singular), and 4) NO valued Case feature (or the chain {It-CP} vill violate the Case Filter). That automatically excludes any 'associate' except a CP with a valued theta role and NO Case assigned to it, which, in practice, solves your problem in all cases. As to 'dummy there', it has a) a valued Category feature (= DP/NP), b) a valued Case feature (nominative, when it is a subject, but alternatively objective, as in I expected there to be some sort of celebration, or oblique, when it follows a P, as in I was fed up with there never being anybody to talk to), c) no valued Number feature, and d) no valued Theta Role feature, either, which, in practice, also solves your problem in all cases: the 'associate' can only be a) a DP, b) it must have a valued Number feature (since, otherwise, there will not inherit it and the {there-DP} chain will not be able to 'agree' with the tensed V), c) it must have a valued Theta Role feature (or, again, the argument chain {there-DP} will lack a Theta Role and the Theta Criterion will be violated), and d) it cannot have a valued Case feature (or, in association with 'there', which already has its own valued Case feature - nominative, accusative, or oblique - the chain {there-DP} will have two valued Case features and will violate the 'Case Filter'). Again, such requirements in practice determine the only possible 'associate' of 'dummy' there in all cases: the associate must be a singular or plural DP with a theta role, but cannot be the complement or the specifier of any Case-assigning category (i.e., neither the complement of V or P, nor the specifier of T or D). That leaves you with specifiers of V, P, or A and with complements of non-Case assigning V's or A's, and, as no sentence will contain more than one accessible item of any of such classes, in practice, your problem vanishes. 

Ignoring theory-bound preferences as to the way theta roles should be labelled in different linguistic 'schools', since in current ontologies 'entities' include not only 'individuals' and 'substances', but also 'events' (among other ontological categories), and since in Helen drove to the party, the party does denote an event, the definition of 'Goal' that you refer to applies perfectly well to that PP: as you seem inclined to think, in most, or even all, current linguistic frameworks, to the party will be analysed as the 'Goal' (not the 'Location'*) of the driving event described in that sentence. *ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS: In the theory of thematic roles, 'Location' technically refers not to a place (an 'individual', in Strawson's sense) but to a functional concept generally expressed by means of a preposition such as in or at (selected or not by the head) that relates the event expressed by the theta-role assigner (usually, but not necessarily, a main verb - it may also be a noun or a preposition) to an area of two/three-dimensional space in(side) which an 'individual' - or an 'event'- is situated or takes place, respectively. Crucially, the name of a place (e.g., London, Charles Street) cannot by itself play the role of 'Location' (nor that of 'Goal', for that matter), because 'places', like 'events', are 'individuals'(in Strawson's sense), not functional entities. If the contrary were true, sentences like * Helen lives London or * Helen drove London would be well-formed and synonymous of * Helen lives in London* and Helen drove to London, respectively, but, of course, they are neither. This is why the thematic role is assigned to the whole PPs in London, to London, to the party, etc., instead of to the DPs that act as the complements of the respective prepositions. In the examples above, in other words, it is the preposition in or to (in the latter case selected by the verb drove) that does the crucial 'functional' work and allows the place or the event to become arguments of two-place relations involving the main event as their other argument. This is very clearly expressed in Davidsonian semantics in LF clauses like 'Location-of(e, London)' - part of the LF of a sentence like Helen works in London - or 'Goal-of(e, the party)'- part of the LF of the OP's Helen drove to the party. Back to the specific nature of 'Location', since areas of space may be contained in more extensive ones, some more careful theta-role theories further distinguish between 'locative' roles like 'point', 'area' and 'region' of space, and, at bottom, they must, because such 'locative' roles may well co-occur in the same sentence (cf. In London, she lives in Charles Street, right in the middle of Mayfair), but, anyway, what really matters for present purposes is that 'locations' - in all their subvarieties - are never introduced by the directional preposition to; they are invariably introduced by 'locative' prepositions such as in, at, by, near, behind, etc. That, by itself, should be strong evidence that to the party cannot be a Location'. Of course, as already explained, the complement of the directional preposition to usually denotes a place, but may also denote an event instead (as happens in the OP's example). Straightforward evidence in support of this claim is that it is possible to add to party temporal specifications like this evening's (cf. Helen drove to this evening's party in her new Audi). The reason is obvious: events occur in time, but 'places' do not, and usually reject time modifiers (unless the place name has been 'coerced' - in Pustejovsky's sense - to refer to something that is not really a place, but something more comprehensive, as in e.g., London at night, The London of Shakespeare's time, etc., but such 'coercions' need not be taken into consideration to offer the OP a reasonable answer to his question). For such reasons, I even find it hard to swallow that the prepositional DP complement the party should be interpretable as a place at all (contrary to what a commentator claims), but, even if that were possible, the PP to the party is by no means interpretable as a 'Location'. In sum: as PP[to] complements like to Charles Street, to London or to the party cannot denote places-in-which-an-entity-is-situated-or-an-event-takes-place, they cannot be assigned the role of 'Location' as the term is normally understood in the linguistic literature; what such PPs denote is the destination of the movement of some individual (Helen's driving, in the OP's example), and so must be thematically classified as 'Goals' (or equivalent labels like 'Destinations', etc.), but surely not as 'Locations'. Under the standard interpretation of the labels 'Location' and 'Goal' in thematic-role theory, therefore, it is not true that, in the OP's sentence, to the party should be analysable either as a 'Goal' or as a 'Location'. It definitely must be analysed as a 'Goal'. 

P&P is, indeed, primarily a 'projectionist frame', in your terms, to the extent that in P&PT syntactic construction starts with, and proceeds 'bottom up' from, a choice of lexical items, by gradually 'satisfying' their complementation/selection features. (This applies to adjuncts, too). To the extent that functional heads like Aspect(s), Modaliti(es), Polarity, Tense, C, etc. are also considered lexical items (which is legitimate, since they ultimately reduce to sets of valued, or to-be-valued-during-a-successful-derivation, attribute-value pairs), P&P is an almost 'pure' projectionist model. The only caveat with respect to such a categorization follows from the fact that the order in which some functional heads are 'projected' relative to each other does not yet follow from their lexical properties (plus general principles like 'satisfaction') and, as a consequence, it has to be stipulated by means of ad hoc 'templates' of the form 'C1 must c-command/have scope over C2', .... 'Cn must c-command/have scope over Cm', etc. Such 'templates', of course, are construction-like and, to the extent P&P syntax would not at present work without them, P&P remains 'constructionist' to a certain degree (like Tagmemics, other 'structuralist' 'slot and filler grammars' of the 1950' and 1960's, or, in fact, early TGG), but that is so because P&P has not yet entirely succeeded in making the whole hierarchy of projections follow from lexical properties and general principles. Programmatically speaking, P&P aimed at becoming a pure 'projectionist' model of syntax. As to your second question, obviously, '(neo)constructionist' approaches, like Tagmemics or structuralist 'slot and filler grammars' of the last century, reject the claim that syntax follows from the projection of lexical properties, rely on 'top-down' or mixed (up&down/parallelistic) generation strategies, and, on the contrary, have themselves largely emerged as a reaction against GB and P&P models of syntax, not the converse. Finally, the 'minimalist program' is by no means a reaction against 'neoconstructionism'. If anything, the MP can be described, for current purposes, as a reaction against previous 'projectionist' Chomskian work along GB and P&P lines. Of course, under minimalist assumptions, syntactic derivations still start from a selection of lexical items (a 'numeration', in the earliest minimalist work, a 'lexical array' in later versions, or from parallel access to the Lexicon in some alternative versions), but Minimalist Syntax, especially in its mature formulations, is no longer 'projectionist' (at least not in its programmatic statements) because the only syntactic operation it allows is (internal/external) 'Merge', and, in theory, 'Merge' is just a recursive set-forming operation subject to 'No Tampering', a principle that claims that the internal features of lexical items cannot be modified by Merge in any way. Thus, in theory at least, minimalist syntactic construction is no longer a matter of 'projecting' and 'satisfying' the features of lexical items, be they 'descriptive' or 'functional'. Whether MG delivers what it aims at is a different matter, though. I wrote 'in theory' and 'programmatically' above because even MP cannot dispense with 'labels' (well, an attempt was made to get by without them a few years ago, but it was a sort of trick and did not catch on, to my knowledge), and the 'label' attached to a merger is 'inherited' from one of the syntactic objects (at first lexical, subsequently phrasal) that Merge operates on, which entails that at least that feature of one of the two objects merged must be searched for inside the object and 'copied'. It is true that, according to Chomsky,'copying' F is not 'tampering' with F, or with the object that contains F, since the original object is not really modified, just duplicated. However, in cases of internal Merge, where the'checking' of a valued feature [F:v] or the 'valuation' of an unvalued one [F:?] is involved, the 'No Tampering' principle is untenable, in my view, because in such circumstances the internal structure of the corresponding categories is inevitably modified by the checking/valuation process (which is why, once F is 'checked'or 'valued', it is 'deactivated' and cannot be 'checked/valued' again - a crucial condition for the correct behaviour of movement, agreement and other 'operations' currently considered aspects of Merge). In sum: in spite of the official programmatic statements to the contrary, even minimalist grammar remains 'projectionist' to some extent. What MG is not at all is a 'constructionist' model, and, needless to say, it did not arise as a reaction against 'neoconstructionist' approaches.
