Beautiful question: yes, there's an a priori knowledge: causality. Everyone knows nature's mechanism of action and reaction, cause and consequence. Since we start existing inside the mother's belly, we make stimulus and get reactions. We know that. Nature works with that. Math describes that perfectly, because causality has been perfect (until quantum mechanics found some incoherences). We speak and interact following the causality mechanism. The mechanisms of causality are related to systems -all things-. There is no cause if there is no system over which to apply it. So, knowledge is built over this a priori base: actions and reactions we clearly identify over things we are familiar with. This is a topic of the systems theory, and I'm an author, so please consider this as an opinion. I write about this because the systems theory requires this kind of adjustments, in the meantime, it's heavily incomplete. 

This is a pears and apples comparison, has no sense. If you want a difference, populism (on the sense you ask) is a way of getting adherents, among other forms of campaigning. Democracy is a form of government, among other forms of governance. Regarding conceptualization, all 'kratos' are forms of government (democracy = demos + kratos, government of the people). Populism (populus + ism, orientation to the people) is an ideological trend, sustaining that the people's voice has the priority amongst other factors. Regarding their relationship, populism is a weakness of democracy. If the majority is ignorant, democracy will be the government of the ignorance. This is precisely the thesis that conservative groups fear throughout all the world. 

Free will is being able to choose AN alternative. Free will is not being able to choose ANY alternative. Here's an example: How many numbers can you name? Would you not say you can't because there are an infinite number? So here's a new question: How many different choices are available to you right now? Well it's also infinite number of choices is it not? And you might say "Yes, but I can't choose to fly like Superman." to which the reply is that physics has nothing to do with free will because if it did then the question would be moot ... I can't will myself to fly like Superman therefore there's no discussion needed (any more than a discussion of 'why isn't superman real'?) Another opposition to free will is that 'it's the reactions in your brain that effect your choices'. Well, yes ... can one 'be' without having physicality? Just because there is 'influence' doesn’t mean you don’t have free will else the argument would be that reality itself precludes free will! ... which would again render the discussion senseless. My thinking is that consciousness means the capacity to distinguish infinity - that as being is a feedback loop then it's endless recursive. How can self-consciousness be 'bounded'? ... is there some end to the recursive feedback loop that is the 'schema'? of being? 

In final terms, the root problem of the 2nd law is this: it formulates a law that is applicable only to systems that follow that law. So, can the 2nd law of thermodynamics be a circular argument? 

I'm a writer, my subject is the theory of systems, so you can consider this as an opinion. On my last book, the theory of Interaction (see ydor.org), I sustain that systems interact in order to exist (therefore we cannot know closed systems, except in our imagination). One of the main features of Interaction is that when two systems interact and get a positive result (related to order), they get attracted in order to repeat interactions (kind of when you like talking to a person, you feel attracted, or when two atoms form a molecule). Therefore, if you notice, after each interaction, systems take a binary decision based on the result of the interaction: attraction or rejection. That means that systems are able of abstracting a set of features into two values: positive or negative attraction. The interaction principles apply for all kind of systems, including persons, individuals. Therefore, after any interaction, an individual can take a decision about any other person or fact: good or bad. You can reduce a whole set of personal features of a girlfriend to a binary set: good or bad, the outcome will rule your decision of attraction and rejection. I should remark that on my books I define intelligence as the ability of taking decisions that allow a person to continue existing. Therefore a person, using logic to earn money by cutting trees and damaging the environment, and in consequence its own existence, is not intelligent. About moral, it uses the same mechanism. Moral is knowledge about simple interactions based on our experience. You will never teach your children to cut trees because you know that it is not intelligent, and moral (using previous definitions). Moral rules (and social or formal rules, laws) raise from our reason, from our intelligence (previous definition), in order for us to survive. While formal rules are complex (think of international commerce laws or even traffic laws), moral rules are simple: they provide knowledge of what is intelligent (previous def.) in simple binary terms (as explained above): good/bad, about our interactions with others, with the environment, etc. E.g. why the hell does a person want to avoid cutting trees? Because it risks human existence, risks our future interactions. Therefore cutting trees is bad. That's an example of how and why a moral rule exist. Of course, a type of utilitarism. 

Got a short quest if creation gives rise to time and the world. Our perception allows observation of that world and we interpret events within it as a result of which we describe as causality. Action and reaction cause and effect. This observation leads to a contradiction since any creation requires action which creation is the effect of that action. Without time you cannot have causality because causality is a sequence of cause and effect and requires time to afford sequence. So the world could not be a result of creation since creation is the reaction or effect of a cause that requires the presence of time. So do we conclude time is eternal to allow the causal nature any creation requires and confirm the correctness in our perception of causality from observation. 

Time allows us to experience events, events from the transient present become fact to those that observe them and reference them from memory. But only with a faith in the recollection because we are unable to determine any truth with the process of there allocation from our perception and its interpretation of the observation of those events. An argument for determination of any truth is able to be counter argued and leave you with no method of determining any truth if the argument for action and reaction holds. This argument if it has no counter argument, as the only truth leads to a necessity of having to have faith in everything you appear to observe or recollect as being the truth without the assurance of proof. Or maybe action and reaction is not a valid argument which frees us and enable us to determine truth through argument and not need faith which the argument 'causes'. 

"One must imagine Sisyphus happy". Yep ... because imagining the likely reality would be too painful. I think Camus is using 'severity by opposites'. (I am quoting myself as I don't know the proper term for this.) This means there's no words that carry the weight needed so instead you use words from the opposite end of the meaning spectrum. For example if our waiter asks if we enjoyed our meal, given that the plates are clean, we could say 'inedible ... hated it ... We want our money back and we didn't even pay yet.' The absurdity gives weight to the depiction. Alternatively, nope. Sisyphus has free will and that means one can choose (to pursue) to be happy regardless of the situation. Camus is saying that, conventionally, it's not possible for reality to give us the external circumstances for instant gratification. Every single conscious person, through free-will, can choose to pursue desensitizing themselves to an otherwise unpleasant reality, and possibly, ultimately, learn to love, be happy with, something you previously hated. I will offer the very very dissimilar in scale example of me and broccoli. I hated it until age 30. I forced myself to eat it ... masking it with spices or such, and now it's my favorite veggie, and I also prefer veggies as my main food group (previously being 'junk food'). 

Doesn't the application of logic and reason to our world lead to us having a measure of the truth in the nature of the world we observe. It's application in the nature of understanding the spiritual we intuitively percieve as part of the world be an attempt in turning the intuition into a truth, like the approach attempts in the physical world. It occurs to me that if we determine the truth of the spiritual we remove the faith, and that removes an important factor in the formation of religion. The faith as my understanding is the strength that underpins religion as you have to overcome the weight of doubt by believing it to be the truth when it is not proved to be so,which is a personal big leap and requires strength of charachter. If the pursuit in the application of logic results in certainty and fact, the value of faith by its loss i think weakens the religion and the importance faith gives it. 

Probably this is the right place to ask. Following such definition, some rocks would be alive (they can grow slowly by incorporating minerals on its structure, then when they break, the process can be described as reproduction, since the children still follow the same mechanisms, growing and reproduction, along thousands of years), and can metabolize certain minerals (metabolism: chemical processing oriented to keep existence, then, if some chemical process contribute to enforce the structure of the rock, and therefore its existence and persistence in time, it can be considered metabolism), respond to several types of stimuli, including electric, magnetic, pressure, etc. Fire or bacteria are just faster. Usually, the problem is just scaling: if we would be able to see rocks grow, we would easily exclude the terms grow, metabolism, reproduction from the definition. The term "life" has been always very complex to precise. We have an intuition of what life should be, characterized by certain types of reproduction, not all, certain speeds of growth, not all, certain types of actions and reactions, not all, certain types of movement, not all, etc. But we have NOT a formal definition of life that can be applied to define if an entity is alive or not. Proof of this is the fact that we still don't know how to classify viruses: they have more similarities to rocks than to living beings, nevertheless they behave exactly like living entities, within scales and levels that match perfectly our intuition of a living entity. So, life is still a subjective definition, discriminating entities moreover based on their dimensional scales (times, sizes, reactions, mutations), and certain subjective factors like self-generated movement (which rocks or robots can also perform due to environmental changes) or reproduction (which software programs can do perfectly). There is no unique definition of life. Every discipline related to biology could have a different one. Finally, it's a nice exercise to find definitions of life and submit rocks, fire water drops or clouds to a strict formal test against them. It's easy to find that there are no concrete, formal, strict and objective differences between biologically living and non-living entities. 

Your argument is a consequence of the logic of the language you used to form it in morality and immorality and its observed concept and the language used to communicate it. Society or people in fact everything is limited by what physically is possible and what is not and the perception of a causal nature in the result of a choice in action of the possible and a return in the perceived pleasure or pain of that action or from experience of a similar action. I have felt also guilt from my actions now I don't know if its a result of conditioning of society or an absolute return in the nature of a choice I took and a fundament of an immoral act. Society judges immoral act upon a notion of guilt and an attempt to keep order from that guilt but its hard to say if every immoral act judged by society results in a guilty feeling absolutely and should accumulate a social judgement of morality from that percieved guilty feeling. 

As phrased I think the question isn't properly representing the issue. To me the question is "What is my moral obligation to be altruistic." because your sole example is a shared cause, not a personal one. Are you morally obligated to campaign for a cause you believe in? ... absolutely, 100%, if it's a personal one. Isn't personal health, both mental and physical, a cause you believe in? Making a living? Using the recycling bins. Paying taxes despite the dental bills from gritting teeth? How about happiness? If you have a cause to 'keep the world safe (so I can be happier)' then isn't practicing the skill of being happier (mental health) a cause you should champion? (If you think happiness is not a moral obligation then why would any participation in society be one ... putting out the trash, regulating one's emotions, etc. People who practice the skill of happiness don't usually commit crimes, hurt others, etc. Why is happiness not a moral cause we all share?) I think because you do not exist as a Borg you have no moral obligation to be altruistic. You DO have a moral obligation to maintain personal integrity. Very practically speaking this usually means spending whatever altristic time you choose on local causes. Most people are most often more effective making small changes on a small scale. For example a person who refuses to have children (despite wanting them) because the child will increase the carbon footprint of the world is not thinking in a healthy way. 

Assumption is a perception of inconclusiveness and cannot be used to obtain the fact of anything, which conclusion should lead to from a rational argument. Any interpretation should not come from a basis of assumption if you conclude that rational argument is a process that returns fact. Science adopts a method of argument from a conception or theory and a test of that through experiment and the data returned from that test which is statistically analysed empirically to affirm or reject the theory based upon a probability of certainty that cannot ever return an absolute. It is certainly an assumption that this method returns any truth based on its application which logically opposes its own nature from its uncertainty and its attempt at truth. Which leads to an interpretation of anything but faith with an absence of any other method. 

The only truth you can take is that in the language your using is formed as a function of the subject experiencing the object and the logic contained within the subject. Every thought you think is a consequence in the language you use and sequentially forms grammitical sentences based up your perception when you experienced learning it. Every thought you will ever have will be based up your level of knowledge of the dictionary of it and the rules learnt from your logic in the perception of the grammar and the construction of thoughts using the grammer and the dictionary. So yes for all intents and purpose yes we may be all experiencing a self induced simulation the means of which to perpetuate the need of the subject and the object the definition of which we have because of the difference observed. And the subject cannot directly observe itself only retropectively, but in the picture of it's self is dependent upon the language gained through objective experience and similarly limited in the reflection of it. The subject and object has to be experienced concurrently and a pyramid of simulation would have to occur simultaneously as a memory of sequence would occur that could question the nature of the object we are subject to and since I don't recall that memory to dispel the object I carry on lol. Since The persitance of memory shapes the subject from information in experiencing the object and gives us our only fact. It becomes a lonely world out there and therefore maybe faith is a greater truth than fact, as each is similarly indeterminate but the later I think more purpose. Well that was a load of flannel just keep your sense of humour mate. Sorry invidullators I should keep this discussion professional I know. And take a load of the grammar I use, l know my limitations :).
