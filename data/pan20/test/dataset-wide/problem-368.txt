A claw-like foot. The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as "claw-like" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a syndactyly of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet. 

I prefer the vodka in March Ho's response. Next would be a way to get much cleaner water than from a river or lake. River water used to be mixed with an alcohol to kill germs - instead, you could extract the water from the grasstato (potatoes have the highest water content of any staple), and use the remaining part of the potato for distillation of its sugars. Grass has been used to make paper since at least 2400 BC, so there are your labels for the vodka bottles (that was just for fun - you could use it for many paper products). 

It's a popular kids tale: the pot of soup that magically produces more and more. In this story, our protagonist in Tunis is making a big pot of Lablali, the children outside are asking him to make some for them, but he doesn't have enough materials to make more. His wife wishes they would have enough for the kids... Suddenly it's blobbing out of the pot at a fast rate, and won't stop. It doesn't look like it will ever stop. This will be a problem soon. It's now down the hills of Sidi Bou Said and gushing out, polluting the Mediterranean. What's the best use and best control of the unending Lablali (feel free to use any sustenance dish that similarly doesn't go bad quickly or need to be chilled)? Since this is WB, I know you're going to ask it. The flow rate is high: 5m3 / second. To avoid this being opinion-based, the correct answer is the one that cleverly uses this for good; is done most efficiently; and addresses containment. Present-day, port city on the Mediterranean. Capping the flow would be a really bad idea, as it doesn't appear to be stopping. 

Stay Dry You may try dry-digging, by placing a long, wide, tube made the same way a wine barrel is. However, this is a cylindrical tube weighted at the bottom and dropped into your area of interest. Get it nice and solid into the lake-bed. 

Nice storyline btw... Buy Time Step 1: Address the Palefaces In addition to uniting the tribes, Mumbini should approach the ships. He knows that CC's third voyage bounced all along Central America within 10 years from hearing about the first, second or third voyage. Now he waits. He likely doesn't know (archaic) Italian, but he does know about culture and history. He knows the names of prominent Europeans from their Renaissance, and a cultured man, such as CC likely knew Italian, Latin, and Spanish. Step 2: On the day of their arrival Mumbini puts on the "clothes" he had made (something like how he guessed they wore during the renaissance), he pulls out a detailed map he made of the coastline of the Americas, and he writes in English on rudimentary paper. He addresses the interlopers, and they understand that he knows of European people, he knows how to write, and he knows a vast amount of the area: and where to find gold and spices. Step 3: The map The map is a very accurate, albeit drawn from memory, map of the coast of Americas, but with one exception: a vast area filled with gold far, far to the south of South America. It is okay that the map is rudimentary, so was CC's! This buys him and his people potentially a hundred years, but not those at what is now USA, including Florida. North and South America were inundated in just a few following years by exploratory missions. It's too late to try to help those in Nova Scotia, Florida, or Brazil. But his people have time. Step 4: Formalize Central America This is going to be difficult; Mumbini will need to formalize Central America in a way that is understood by Europeans. This will not be done in a single lifetime, due to the enormous overland distances between tribes. A common, written language (English is a good start, for structure), and a common goal, which other answers here have hinted to. This is a broad, long-range, plan for the future, including formalized borders, to allow some tribes greater autonomy. The United States of Central America. Step 5: Pit Nations Against Each Other Mumbini's long-range plan includes an oral history (or rather, future prediction) of how to gain influence with Portugal, Spain, and even England for when Central America is 're-visited.' Then begin promising or even delivering on trade and getting Portugal to compete with Spain, for example, to be allied with the USofCA. Step 6: Hope for Innovation After establishing a culture of innovation over warfare (use other peoples' answers for this), prepare schematics of things like trebuchets or catapults, and fortifications. Include the idea of soaps and how to wear a bandana or mask over the face when talking to future white-faces, to avoid contraction of diseases. Step 7: Hide Yo Gold, Hide Yo Spices Usher in an age where rich soil, or a rare tree are more important than gold for decoration or religious symbolism. Good luck with that. As a contingency if this doesn't work, always have a secret person in each tribe prepared to hide the things precious to Europeans when they approach. It won't be easy to pull off, but hopefully it will buy time: European race for colonization came long after exploration and declaration of ownership. Cross your fingers that they will be un-interested in 'colonizing' your land for a while, buying you more time. Mumbini is really going to miss wi-fi and air conditioning... 

In the Arabian Gulf, there's a lot of muddy, mucky water covered with mangroves, and fauna such as flamingos and dugong/manatee populations. At night and in the mornings, there's a thick fog over these areas, even though this is one of the hottest regions of the world. I like the other answers, just adding another existing situation. This is us mucking through the swamp in the middle of summer with kayaks and sunblock in Abu Dhabi. Heaps of swampland all year round, with little islets and a diverse ecology. There also exists a lot of marine diversity as well. The requirement for this kind of ecology is slow flushing - the movement of water should be slight tidal up/down in an area with clean water and limited flushing in a climate that has hot days and cold nights (coastal desert). Sediments are a mix of sand and organic soils between freshwater and salt water (estuary), and is immediately against a desert landscape. 

Timelessness I have no idea what will be taboo in tomorrow's world, but in order to protect reputation, there should be well documented caveat's in new-Jesus' teaching that allows flexibility. Other religions that don't allow this might be popular today, but that is out of desperation and acting out. Convictions (not necessarily religious) that allow flexibility have and will last longer. This question is a tough cookie. 

It is the 10th Century and the hero, Ibn Muadhe has discovered trigonometry about six centuries before Cartes, and has received a wonderful gift. A very spiritual Avicenna had rushed by camel and horse from Persia to bring two special stones each the size of a person's hand, which can communicate with each other much like present-day telephones, with exceptions. They can only communicate by a straight line and only through atmosphere. They can work in rain and fog, not that I imagine that's a huge issue in Al-Andalus. The Caliph of Cordova is fascinated and has demanded Ibn Muadhe establish a communication system as far as possible for strategic purposes. 

No and Yes Some structures, like homes even with roofs could be built using structurally stronger materials (steel instead of wood frame to support the roof). The social impact this would have would be smaller living and working living spaces for people, because materials to build would be cost-prohibitive. This impacts the poor even more, when they have to use more material for their shanty houses. The towers we have today would not look as they do, if they existed at all. The weight of a tower here could include 200,000 tons of steel and 425,000 tons of cement1. The weight of this multiplied by five would be unfeasible with '70s technology. You'd have short, squat buildings throughout. This means that cities will generally have to sprawl more. Tent-like and dome-like structures will be more popular, as they have lighter "roof" loads. Bridges would likely be non-existent, except very small ones. This means geographical constraints to travel, although crossing a river could happen with a (modified) ferry. Communication and travel would be impacted. Activities that are done inside that could be done outside, would, and you have to hope for good weather. Warehousing would likely involve tarps covering materials. 

Capital designation has a number of causes. But luckily you have it refined to medieval capitals. I'll work with your assumptions: 

I've seen this very thing (medieval combat on bicycles) in Portland, Oregon... ;) Terrain - The location of your battles becomes very important; traversing through forests or across streams becomes more taxing. Not to say that you can't dismount and carry the bikes. Design considerations - large, flexible (leatherbound?) tires for going over rocks; light, sturdy frames (steel?). Protection - It becomes critical to offer protection on the bike, rather than having your soldier hold a shield. Design considerations - thin, sturdy protective shield on the front and sides. It is also important to protect the wheels and the gears. Much like bringing down a horse, it could be very easy to immobilize a bike. Advantages - You don't have to feed a bike. You can take a bike apart for transport over long or difficult terrain. A bike can be hauled up a short cliff a lot easier than a horse. Riders can change out on a bike indefinitely (barring the need for maintenance). Limitations - Before switching to bikes, I think the Romans of the day would switch to the Camel Calvary: larger, stronger, faster, and suitable in many conditions.
