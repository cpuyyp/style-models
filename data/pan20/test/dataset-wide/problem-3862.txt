Let $K$ be a complete valued field extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with possibly imperfect residual field $k$. Assume that there exists a ring endomorphism $\sigma: K\to K$ lifting the $p$-th power map of $k$. The question is : given an (arbitrary) finite extension $L/K$, is it true that there exists a finite extension $M/L$ together with a Frobenius endomorphism lifting $\sigma$, or a power of $\sigma$ ? The answer is yes if $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is finite (and hence $\sigma$ is bijective). In fact (up to my mistakes) by Galois theory arguments any Galois extension has a Frobenius automorphism lifting $\sigma$. The answer is also positive if $L/K$ is unramified. In other words this means (by definition) that $L = K \otimes_{C(k)} C(k')$, where $k'/k$ is any field extension and $C(k)$, $C(k')$ are Cohen rings of $k$, and $k'$ respectively (Cohen rings are the analogous of Witt Vectors for imperfect fields). In fact maps between fields of characteristic $p$ lifts (not uniquely, hence not functorially) to their Cohen rings. Do you have any information about the existence of such a Frobenius in the ramified case ? I need a Frobenius up to possibly extend my field $L$. 

Hi, The fact that the Frobenius produces a differential equation is classical. Dwork was the first to find it out. As an reference in your exact context you have the paper of Fontaine in the Grothendieck Festschrift Vol.2, section 2.2.4. The converse of this fact is false, but there exists a conjecture of Dwork about it (see below). 1) If you have a connection you possibly do not have any Frobenius compatible to it in general (below I provide an example). 2) Moreover this Frobenius is never unique since a Frobenius is basically an isomorphism between the differential equation and its pull-back by the Frobenius functor. The family of morphisms between two differential equations form a vector space (the category is always additive, and depending on the type of equations that you consider it can be often abelian and Tannakian). EXAMPLE : Consider the equation $y' = (\frac{a}{x})\cdot y$, where $a$ is a constant element, and $x$ is the variable. It is known that this equation has a Frobenius structure if and only if $a$ lies in $\mathbb{Z}_p\cap\mathbb{Q}$. $\bullet$ The existence of a Frobenius structure implies some restriction on the equation. The major of them are the solvability and the rationality of the so called exponents. SOLVABILITY : This is a condition about the radius of convergence of the solutions at the generic point (this corresponds to a certain point of a certain Berkovich space). Solvability means that at this particular point the taylor solutions of the equations have the largest possible radius. Robba proved that the equation of the above example is solvable if and only if $a\in\mathbb{Z}_p$. EXPONENTS : The definition of the $p$-adic exponents is quite complicated. They have been defined firstly by G.Christol, then improved (i.e. simplified) by B.Dwork publiched in the "rendiconti" of Padua. For both of these notions you can consult the Book (under construction) of G.Christol $URL$ THE CONJECTURE : B.Dwork conjectured that under these two conditions solvability + rationality of the exponents the equation should have a so called Frobenius structure (i.e. the existence of a Frobenius). This conjecture have been the object of a section in the paper of Y.Andr√© $URL$ (section 7.2). This conjecture seems to have been (very recently) proved by Z.Mebkhout. NOTE : The conjecture is true for rank one differential modules over the Robba ring. This is due to B.Chiarellotto G.Christol in the case of polynomial coefficients, and to myself in the general case (I also have copletely classified these equations, this provides an elementary but quite intricated class of examples) $URL$ . 

For $S^2$ all symplectic diffeomorphisms are hamiltonian, and the symplectomorphism group is homotopy equivalent to $SO(3)$. For other surfaces, I find the papers by Andrew Cotton-Clay helpful, for example $URL$ But of course, if you just want some hands-on non-trivial symplectomorphisms, I think Dehn twists would be interesting enough. 

I suspect there's another implicit assumption they used but suppressed here, that the evaluation always gives a cycle due to torus action. I do not have a clear idea why the assumption on simple puncture plays a role. The Li-Ruan's paper and settings therein do not seem to be responsible for this assumption. Notice that, in the setting of the above paper, the evaluation should involve a virtual perturbation since the moduli space in question is (a maslov=$2$ disk)+($k$ copies of maslov=$0$ spheres). The following special case should help concretize my question: consider still a toric manifold, where the Kuranishi structure and perturbation seem much easier to construct according to toric FOOO I&II. If one considers a certain contact type hypersurface which is Morse-Bott and invariant under torus action, and an arbitrary classes with maslov=$2$, can one still claim such a gluing result "standard"? 

I came across a new type of gluing in the FOOO paper $URL$ (maybe not so new to experts). The situation is as follows: one considers a relative (to lagrangian) class and want to understand the evaluation maps of the moduli space to the lagrangian. An option is to do the original FOOO thing--Kuranishi structure, multisection perturbation and evaluation; however, if there is a separating contact type hypersurface in the manifold, where the lagrangian entirely lies on one of the pieces, there's another option. I can first do neck-stretching in SFT, then evaluate the fiber product of moduli space involving punctures on the two sides, fiber product taken over evaluation on the punctures where the moduli spaces can be glued. My question is: 

McDuff proved that there exist continuum many non-isomorphic (separable) II${}_1$ factors. I would like to politely ask whether it is known/open if one can find $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ (or at least $\mathfrak{c}^+$) many such factors. My feeling is that this is not possible to construct more than $\mathfrak{c}$ separable von Neumann algebras by a simple cardinality argument. The ball of $B(H)$ for $H$ separable, is metrisable under the ultraweak topology, so it has at most $\mathfrak{c}$ ultraweakly closed subsets. So we cannot have more than $\mathfrak{c}$ different balls, and consequently, have more than $\mathfrak{c}$ non-isomorphic algebras. Is this correct? 

Is there an example of an uncountable Boolean algebra $B$ in which every chain is countable and such that $\ell_\infty$ embeds into the Banach space $C(\mbox{Stone }B)$? The latter requirement is not very important, I just want to exclude some trivial cases, like the algebra of finite/cofinite subsets on some uncountable set. 

Let $p\in (1,\infty)$ and let $q$ be conjugate to $p$. Is there a subspace of $\ell_1(\ell_p)$ isomorphic to $\ell_q$? Of course, I am uninterested in the case $p=2$. 

Let $\lambda$ be an infinite cardinal. Consider the Cantor cube $\Delta_\lambda = \{0,1\}^\lambda$. It is a standard fact in topology that the topological weight (= minimal cardinality for a basis) of $\Delta_\lambda$ is $\lambda$. Let $S$ be a zero-dimensional compact space of weight $\lambda$ and suppose $s\colon \Delta_\lambda\to S$ is a continuous suriection. Does there exists a closed subspace $D$ of $\Delta_\lambda$, which is homeomorphic to $S$ such that $p|_D$ is a homeomorphism? 

In dimension $4$ I feel this should be proved, and let me make a fuzzy attempt. In dimension $4$ Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds are all rational or ruled, so except for $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which needs independent check, you may just take an $S^1$-equivariant almost complex structures and consider the self-intersection zero class which is automatically transversal. This gives a fibration where the singular points come from bubblings which should be separated on the base by perturbations. This fibration should be what you want, and the plausibility comes from that if your $S^1$-action comes from transporting the fibers instead of rotating the fibers, then your base needs to rotate, but the singular values prevents you to do so except for some extreme cases where one checks by case study. If this is the only construction in the 4-dimensional case, I feel it very hard to extend to higher dimensions with current techniques. Because if you try to use Donaldson's construction on $4$ dimension, it clearly never give you satisfactory answers because the Donaldson hypersurfaces are usually not spheres, so this line seems not approaching a general argument; while on the other hand, if you give up Donaldson's construction, it is already extremely hard to even just to find a smooth symplectic hypersurface, at least for me personally. 

I suppose this has been used for a while in GW theory, but I am not sure what can be claimed "standard" in this case of Floer homology. According to the above paper,
