I just stumbled over the Elevation Training Mask, which strives to simulate high altitude training by restricting air flow. Now I'm wondering how much sense such a device would make. Some question that I'm asking myself: 

Isometric exercises do have their place in training, but can never replace the lift itself. The problem with isometric exercises is, that you don't have any range of motion, you just hold the weight there and contract your muscles. While that surely has a positive effect on the muscles in that position, it doesn't help much in other parts of the lift. For example, if you're doing an isometric deadlift at knee-height, that won't really help you at lockout. Neither will it improve your ability to get the weight of the ground much. It would provide some benefits though, as you'd strengthen your core and probably get better at the knee-high part of the deadlift. So, basically no, isometric exercises are not good at replacing a lift, but they are a tool to improve certain parts of a lift. If you can identify weak points in your deadlift, you might still improve it that way, even without a barbell. 

Of course you can always add vegetables like carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers and also fruit in reasonable amounts. Some last words on the workout. A 5-day-split is suboptimal for most people, as you're training each muscle group only once per week. For that to be effective, you'd have to have a very high-intensity only a few people can keep up. I'd rather to 2-3 full body workouts per week and add in some cardio, but that's just me. In the end it has to (again) work for you. Just wanted to mention it. 

While I do agree with the trainer that your plan is very convoluted, I do not agree with her idea of a better plan. Also, what Kneel-Before-ZOD said is quite right, but I feel like I could add something worthwhile. Now brace yourself, this got much lengthier than I first intended. 

It seems to me, that you're limiting your progress by going to failure. To improve with bodyweight exercises quickly, that's not the best way. The method I'd propose would be one called 'Greasing the groove'. You'd spread a number of sub-maximal sets (say 10 reps) through your day, increasing your overall volume and training frequency. If you do this for a week and test your 3 sets on sunday again, I'm sure you will have improved by a fair bit. Once you manage to do 3x12 consistently, I'd suggest stepping it up a bit to progress. This can be done by placing your toes on a small box, for example. Once you manage 3x12 with that box, take a bigger one. Advanced progressions include one-armed pushups or handstand pushups, if you want to go crazy. (This answer assumes you're going for overall fitness, hence the 3x12 limit. If you're going more for endurance you can work up to 50 in a row using the same method just as easily.) 

A bit of pretext: I've been having sporadic knee pains (left side) for the last 6 years now. I could never do any leg cardio like running or cycling. I went to four physicians/orthopedics, was x-rayed 2 times and went through 2 MRTs, with no results other then "you're still young and untrained, take it slow". The problem was no matter how slow I took it, my knee would hurt after, but seldom during, the exercise. One day, some months ago I decided to screw it and go all out. Recklessly, I loaded up my barbell and started squatting. A funny thing happened, as my knees actually felt very healthy during the movement. What's more, my knees felt better the day after the squats too, and even more so as I progressed in weight lifted. Six months later, I'm still having the occasional knee pain, but much less then before. Also, if I have this pain and do 3-5 bodyweight squats with good form, it goes away and stays away for several hours. It also works with back pain (from sleeping on a sofa, for example). Now there has to be some explanation, some physiological effect that I do not yet understand. If anyone could help me out and explain to me why squatting helps alleviate knee and back pain, I could probably use that effect more efficiently in the future. 

The warm up is more or less optional, as you'll be doing warm up sets before each compound exercise. It's good to get the core temperature up, though, and just warm up the body as a whole. Now, the first portion of the actual program are compound movements, which you can alternate between from workout to workout. These are the most important exercises, as they train almost your whole body and will lead to more strength (and thus muscle) most efficiently. Since you're concentrating on technique and gaining strength, 3x5 reps would be optimal, hopefully allowing you to raise weight by 2,5kg (5lbs) per workout for some weeks.I've found that alternating reduces the repetitive strain on certain muscles/joints and also shifts the work to muscles that would otherwise be underused. (Also note this is almost the basic Starting Strength program, which I can only recommend to beginners) The second portion are auxilliary exercises. These are used to train weak spots that the compounds didn't cover. Once you progress and notice weak spots, you can customize these to react to shortcomings (Flyes for chest, Calf Raises for calves etc.). They are done to add volume to your workout, so 3x12 reps should be good. Cardio is last, as it's not really that important if you're already exhausted when running. I assume you're doing this to burn additional calories and increase your cardiovascular performance. Thus, as long as you're not doing a running-technique session, being tired is okay. Nutrition: I can't say much about nutrition, but if you want to build muscle (lean or not) you need to have a caloric surplus (eat more than you use). While beginners are to a certain degree able to lose fat and gain muscle simultaneously, that process won't last forever and it's inefficient. With a slight caloric surplus (~500kcal) you should be able to build muscle and gain strength fast, while keeping fat gains pretty low. Just try not to gain more than 0,5kg (1lb) per week and you should be good. 

That's the minimum I would do, three times per week (every week, as consistency matters). Those four lifts train your whole body in as short a time as possible. But they will be difficult to do without the right equipment... Equipment: The first and most important thing for a home gym (imho) is a barbell (second is a power rack). The barbell enables you to do all of the compound lifts in their regular form, without compensating for dumbbell-wobble or weird wrist angles (looking at you, ez-bar). I'd strongly recommend you to get a barbell as soon as possible and a power rack next, as you'll have a hard time to do any meaningful squat and/or deadlift work without one. If you absolutely have to, sell your other equipment or trade it in, as you'll get a much better 'bang for your buck' from a barbell. Should you for some reason not be willing/able to get your hands on a barbell, you can try to compensate for the low weights by doing harder variants of the exercises. The Clean and Press is already a good start, the Snatch would probably also work (if you can get the form right). For Squats, you could try one-legged variants, while a wider grip makes the Deadlift harder to perform. If you're able to max out on these exercises with your current equipment you can still raise the repetitions per set to work your muscles harder. 

Vascularity (I assume this to be the visibility of veins) can be improved, or indeed hindered, by several factors. Some you could change are: 

As far as I can tell, the word for the sound is Crepitus, although this not only describes "popping", but also "grating" and "crackling". While not necessarily pathological itself, many conditions actually do lead to that kind of sound. If it's especially the "popping" that interests you, the wiki on cracking joints seems to adress this. Different processes in the synovial fluid (forming/dissolving of gas bubbles) are cited as the main reason, although the snapping of ligaments over a prominence are also mentioned. As far as actively cracking joints being harmful, several studies (see wiki link above) indicate that popping of finger joints, at least, do not produce any problems. 

So I was wondering if there are formulas to calculate the energy expenditure of common lifts, like deadlifts, bench press, squat etc. I know that every formula could only be an approximation, due to differing technique, execution speed etc. I was just curious if such formulas exist and if so, how accurate they are. If they don't exist, why is that? Did just noone care to find out? Is it not feasible due to one of the factors mentioned above (or other factors), if so which? 

Foam rolling and streching is a good beginning, but strengthening the back can go a long way to reducing discomfort/pain in the back area. For the thoracic spine, you'd want to strengthen your middle/upper back. Some exercises that would help in doing so are: 

This is the most comprehensive (and quite recent) formula I could find, which takes in account many factors that others don't (age, heart rate etc.). Hope it helps :) 

As for grip: The bad news is, I'm not sure what stretches would be advisable to get to clean grip, but there're already some question on that topic on this site (I think someone recommended aikido strechtes, go look it up). The good news, however, is that you can use a 'clean grip' even if you're not flexible enough. For this, one uses straps, like in this video (at the start, but the rest is good, too). Like Thibs says in the video, straps can also be used instead of a 'real' clean grip to prevent elbow strain, but that's personal preference. 

The main difference in the various forms of the 'Skull Crusher' or Triceps Extension (or indeed the Bench Press) is the involvement different muscles. As you change your position relative to the direction of gravity, some muscles will have to work more, while others have to work less.Those are notably the chest muscles: 

First of all, I don't use any Nike products and can therefore not verify my answer myself. All information is taken from the Nike+ Support page, though, so I'm pretty confident it's correct. The most likely reason for your differing nikefuel gains is the device type. If you are using the SportsBand and your friend is using the RunningApp, your nikefuel is most likely calculated differently, as each device is optimized to track a certain type of activity. As per the specific support page: 

This all depends on your workout program and your current level, of course, so my advice is pretty general. If you provide a bit more information (full workout plan with exercises, sets, reps, weight used etc.) I could give much more detailed advice. Improving Recovery: As JohnP already mentioned, carbs are not bad, so I don't know why you would bulk with a low-carb diet. Not only are carbs important for short term energy, but they are also building blocks that should not be left out if you want the best recovery you can get. In general, eating more would be a good idea. Track your weight and see if you're still making acceptable gains. Once your weight gain slows you might want to eat more to compensate for that. If you've ever done a prolonged cutting phase you'll know how bad recovery suffers once you're not eating enough. If eating more is hard for you, think about substituting a litre of water with a litre of milk. Provided you're not allergic, that's a quick 400kcal fix. Another point you mentioned is sleep. Normally, 8 hours of sleep a night should be sufficient, but the more you tax your body, the more sleep you need. If you can manage it, try to sleep 9 hours and see how that goes. Lastly, there's supplementation. Most people will tell you you don't need it and I'd say they're right. If you've got your nutrition under control you certainly won't need any pills or powder to recover from your workouts. Should you want to try anything though, make sure to try one product at a time and assess its effects on your body. Don't do a supplemental equivalent of a roundhouse kick or you'll never know what worked. Things to try would be fast carbs during Ingress sessions, glutamine as an additional component of your post-workout-shake or ZMA for better sleep. I myself supplement carbs, found glutamine to be a waste of money and have never tried ZMA. 

There are two ways of losing calories without raising recovery needs much that I can think of: Eccentric-less training: One of the best ways to burn calories (or get additional training volume) while minimising recovery needs is eccentric-less training. The eccentric portion of a lift (or any exercise) puts far more strain on your central nervous system and your muscle tissue. By omiting that portion, you can regenerate way faster from exercise and not impede your main lifts that much. Some great exercises that only use concentric load: 

Generally, if you managed to complete one cycle, you'd just increase the weight by the recommended amount (10kg) and start a new one. There will be a point where you won't be able to complete all reps on a cycle and, as far as I understand Wendler's philosophy, there's no point in rushing there. Wendler also adressed the speed of progress on 5/3/1 in this article, that reads:
