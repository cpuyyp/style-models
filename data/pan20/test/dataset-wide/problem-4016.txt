The field is nonabelian here, but you still might be able to write $L(\psi)$ in terms of Artin representations (which are 1-dim, thus Dirichlet chars, in the previous case). Indeed, the Conductor of $L(\psi)$ is 257, and it is valuable to search the LMFDB for dimension 3 Artin representations of this conductor. $URL$ The LMFDB searching mechanism lists two Artin representations of this dimension and conductor, but they have the same $L$-function (compare the computed zeros). 

Also not my field, but... 1) Define "few"? There are many available, already for homotopy methods. See $URL$ "RELATED SOFTWARE: Homotopy continuation methods for polynomial systems are implemented in various computer programs, listed in alphabetic order: Bertini [1, 2], CONSOL [14], HOM4PS-2.0 [9], HomLab [18, Appendix C], NAG4M2 [10], PHoM [8], POLSYS PLP [26], and POLSYS GLP [20]. Both POL-SYS PLP and POLSYS GLP are part of the development of HOMPACK [24, 25]. Polyhedral homotopies need mixed volumes, computed by DEMiCs [13], Mixvol [4], and MixedVol [5]." As Wikipedia noted, Maple has (at least) two solving methods. Mathematica also has some. 2) They are perhaps not easy to build (problems with numerical errors, tracing homotopy paths), but this is not the critical factor. 3) One of the main "markets" is robotics. You can note that some of the notable authors in the field (Wampler most obviously) have jobs either directly in or related to (such as part-time consultant) the car industry. See also (Wampler and Sommese) $URL$ "While systems of polynomial equations arise in fields as diverse as mathematical finance, astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and biology, perhaps no other application field is as intensively focused on such equations as rigid-body kinematics. This article reviews recent progress in numerical algebraic geometry, a set of methods for finding the solutions of systems of polynomial equations that relies primarily on homotopy methods, also known as polynomial continuation. Topics from kinematics are used to illustrate the applicability of the methods. High among these topics are questions concerning robot motion." The slides of Verschelde's 2003 talk also have some applications listed. $URL$ 4) The market is not cornered, in particular methods that exploit sparsity are of high interest. For instance, in the Math Reviews of Li's 2003 survey, it is noted that half the 100 pages are involved with sparsity. $URL$ "More than half of this almost 100 page survey is devoted to the exploitation of sparsity, as most applications give rise to polynomials which have fewer monomials with nonzero coefficients than general polynomials of the same degree. Quite often, sparse systems then also have far fewer roots compared to systems of general polynomials of the same degree. Any homotopy continuation method which is based only on degree bounds will likely have to trace far too many diverging paths to find all solutions of a sparse polynomial system." See also Section 10 of the above Wampler and Sommese paper, for the types of improvements that are being made (or would like to be seen). 5) Yes, though Wikipedia's information here ("25") is not exactly reliable. For instance, see section 8 of the aforementioned Wampler and Sommese paper ($URL$ "To put some of this in perspective, consider a sequence of polynomial systems arising from discretizing the Lotka–Volterra population model that is presented in Hauenstein et al. (2011). HOM4PS-2.0 and PHCpack both implement the polyhedral homotopy method for solving sparse polynomial systems, while Bertini implements regeneration (discussed in Section 10.2) for solving such systems (Hauenstein et al. 2011). For these systems, the number of solutions over C is the number of paths tracked by the polyhedral homotopy method. Even so, the polyhedral homotopy becomes impractical as the number of variables increases due to the computational complexity of computing a start system via the mixed volume. For example, consider solving the n = 24, 32, and 40 variable instances of the Lotka–Volterra model using a single core running 64-bit Linux. Here the number of non-singular isolated solutions equals $\sqrt{2^n}$ (which equals the mixed volume). For the 24 variable system, PHCpack took over 18 days while HOM4PS-2.0 and Bertini both took around 10 minutes. For the 32 variable system, PHCpack failed to solve the system in 45 days, HOM4PS-2.0 took over 3 days and Bertini took roughly 5 hours. For the 40 variable system, PHCpack and HOM4PS-2.0 both failed to solve the system in 45 days, but Bertini solved the system in under a week. Since regeneration is parallelizable, we also solved the 32 and 40 variable systems using 64 cores (8 nodes each having dual 2.33 GH Xeon 5410 quad-core processors). In parallel, Bertini took less than 8 minutes and 4 hours to solve the 32 and 40 variable polynomial systems, respectively." In this example, Bertini thus found $\sqrt{2^{40}}$ isolated solutions, somewhat larger than the Wikipedia bound of 25. Of course the system should be "special" (likely meaning sparse in some sense) to deal with a large Bezout (or mixed volume) number, but many interesting systems do have particular properties. (The same is true for Gr\"obner basis methods, that the generic behavior might not be very relevant to any specific given instance.) I don't know if by "automatic" you want to be able to solve generic systems of a given Bezout number efficiently, probably that is a different question. 

We shall denote the integral with the letter $I$, i.e. : $$I:=\int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y} \int_0^y \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{z} [\sin{x}+\sin{(x-y)}-\sin{(x-z)}-\sin{(x-y+z)}]$$ The key point is to insert a damping exponential $e^{-\alpha z}$ (where $\alpha \geq 0$) into the integrand, this makes the integral directly dependent on the $\alpha$ factor, then apply the Leibnitz formula for differentatiaon under the integral sign, finally integrate again recalling $I(\infty)=0$ and $I(0)=I$. Albeit one can view on this procedure, respectively it can be done, using replacement $$\frac{1}{z}=\int_0^\infty \! e^{-\alpha z} \; {\mathrm{d}\alpha}$$ Then, the change of the order of integration would imply this reformulation to appear : $$I=\int_0^\infty \! {\mathrm{d}\alpha} \int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y} \int_0^y {\mathrm{d}z} \, [\sin{x}+\sin{(x-y)}-\sin{(x-z)}-\sin{(x-y+z)}] \, e^{-\alpha z}$$ The inner integral is now directrly evaluable, holding the line : $$I=\int_0^\infty \! {\mathrm{d}\alpha} \! \int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y} \! \frac{1-e^{-\alpha y}}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} (\sin{x}+\sin{(x-y)}) +\frac{1+e^{-\alpha y}}{1+\alpha^2}(\cos{x}-\cos{(x-y)}) $$ As you can fine in this article ($URL$ integral similar to one contained in $I$ is computed there, namely : $$\zeta{(2)} = \int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y} (\cos{(x-y)}-\cos{x}) $$ Althought, from representation of $I$ we are able to derive this result (denoted $\tilde{I}$ in the article) regardless of using the final one as a fact or from a different source. The actual approach is however very similar as the one described in the article : Just consider a parametric integral $\tilde{I}(\alpha)$ defined as: $$\tilde{I}(\alpha) := \int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{1+e^{-\alpha y}}{y} (\cos{(x-y)}-\cos{x}) \, \mathrm{d}y $$ Evidently : $\tilde{I}(0)=2\tilde{I} \wedge \tilde{I}(\infty)=\tilde{I}$, using Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we can write $$\tilde{I}=-\left( \tilde{I}-2\tilde{I} \right)=-\left( \tilde{I}(\infty)-\tilde{I}(0) \right)=-\int_0^\infty \tilde{I'}(\alpha) \, \mathrm{d}\alpha$$ Then differentiation under the integral sign and some tricky integration will lead us to the value $\zeta{(2)}$ as well. Nevertheless, we will now continue in evaluation of $I$, the effort done on the discussion of the $\zeta{(2)}$ integral is not meaningless at all, because now we will separate this result from our integral representation of $I$, because of the relation : $$1+e^{-\alpha y}=2-(1-e^{-\alpha y})$$ we now split the $I$-integral into two pieces : $$I=J-2\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}\alpha \frac{\zeta{(2)}}{1+\alpha^2} =J-\frac{\pi^3}{6}$$ where $$J:=\int_0^\infty \! {\mathrm{d}\alpha} \! \int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} \int_0^x \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{y} \! \frac{1-e^{-\alpha y}}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} (\sin{x}+\sin{(x-y)})-\frac{1-e^{-\alpha y}}{1+\alpha^2}(\cos{x}-\cos{(x-y)})$$ We are doing this for preparation to make an unified replacement (another), namely : $$\frac{1-e^{-\alpha y}}{y}=\int_0^\alpha \! e^{-\beta y} \; {\mathrm{d}\beta}$$ After change of the order of integration in $\beta$ : $$J=\int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} \! \int_0^\alpha \! {\mathrm{d}\beta} \! \int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x} {\int_0^x} \mathrm{d}y \,[\sin{x}+\sin{(x-y)}-\alpha (\cos{x}-\cos{(x-y)})] e^{-\beta y}$$ Again, by direct integration of inner integral : $$J\!=\!\int_0^\infty \!\!\!\! \frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} \!\! \int_0^\alpha \!\! {\mathrm{d}\beta} \! \int_0^\infty \!\! \mathrm{d}x \frac{\sin{x}\!-\!\alpha\cos{x}}{\beta}\frac{1\!-\!e^{-\beta y}}{x}\!+\!\frac{\alpha \beta-\!1}{1\!+\!\beta^2}\frac{\cos{x}\!-\!e^{-\beta y}}{x}\!+\!\frac{\alpha\!+\!\beta}{1\!+\!\beta^2}\frac{\sin{x}}{x}$$ Resulting integrals are somewhat elementary (i.e. Dirichlet integral etc.), however we can use that dumb replacement rule again using $$\frac{1}{x}=\int_0^\infty \! e^{-\gamma x} \; {\mathrm{d}\gamma}$$ The other replacement however could also be done, i.e. $$\frac{1-e^{-\beta x}}{x}=\int_0^\beta \! e^{-\gamma x} \; {\mathrm{d}\gamma}$$ Define $$ \begin{split} S(\beta) & :=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \frac{1-e^{-\beta y}}{x}\sin{x} \\ C(\beta) & :=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \frac{1-e^{-\beta y}}{x}\cos{x} \\ L(\beta) & :=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \frac{\cos{x}-e^{-\beta y}}{x} \\ D & :=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \frac{\sin{x}}{x} \end{split}$$ By definition then $$ J = \int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} \int_0^\alpha {\mathrm{d}\beta} \; \frac{1}{\beta}S(\beta)-\frac{\alpha}{\beta} C(\beta)+\frac{\alpha \beta-1}{1+\beta^2} L(\beta)+\!\frac{\alpha+\beta}{1+\beta^2} D $$ Now on the evaluation - for the first two integrals $S$ and $C$ the quickest way to compute them is via second type of replacement, The third an fourth one are done (due to the convergence issues) by the "dumb" replacement. For each integral we have: $$S(\beta)=\int_0^\beta {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \sin{x} e^{-\gamma x} = \int_0^\beta {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \frac{1}{1+\gamma^2}=\arctan{\beta} \\ \\ C(\beta)=\int_0^\beta {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \cos{x} e^{-\gamma x} = \int_0^\beta {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma^2}=\frac{1}{2} \ln{(1+\beta^2)} \\ L(\beta)=\int_0^\infty {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x (\cos{x}\!-\!e^{-\beta x}) e^{-\gamma x} = \int_0^\infty {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \frac{\gamma}{1\!+\!\gamma^2}\!-\!\frac{1}{\beta\!+\!\gamma} = \ln{\frac{\sqrt{1 \!+\!\gamma^2}}{\beta \! + \! \gamma}} {\Big|}_0^\infty = \ln{\beta} \\ D=\int_0^\infty {\mathrm{d}\gamma} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}x \sin{x} e^{-\gamma x} = \int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}\gamma}{1+\gamma^2} = \frac{\pi}{2} $$ Substituting these results to the $J$ integral : $$ J = \int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}\alpha}{\alpha(1+\alpha^2)} \int_0^\alpha {\mathrm{d}\beta} \; \frac{\arctan{\beta}}{\beta}-\frac{\alpha}{2\beta} \ln{(1+\beta^2)}+\frac{\alpha \beta-1}{1+\beta^2} \ln{\beta}+\!\frac{\alpha+\beta}{1+\beta^2} \frac{\pi}{2} $$ Next step will turn out to be really important. Just consider how far we are, we ended up with a double integral with its domain of integration - infinite triangle, i.e. half of the first quadrant. Let us perform a variable change in such manner it transforms to rectangle. There are many candidates (e.g. polar one), however we chose this particular : $$\alpha=t \\ \beta=tk$$ With Jacobian of transformation equal to $J=t$, domain itself now consists of a semiinfinite strip $$(t,k)\in\{(0,\infty)\times(0,1)\}$$ After this transformation : $$ J \!=\! \int_0^1 \!\mathrm{d}k \int_0^\infty \!\mathrm{d}t \; \frac{\arctan{kt}}{kt(1+t^2)}-\frac{\ln{(1\!+\!k^2t^2)}}{2k(1\!+\!t^2)}\!-\!\frac{1-kt^2}{(1\!+\!t^2)(1\!+\!k^2t^2)} \ln{(kt)}\!+\!\!\frac{t(1+k)}{(1\!+\!t^2)(1\!+\!k^2t^2)} \frac{\pi}{2} $$ Defining ($0<s<4$) : $$ \begin{split} J_1(k) & :=\int_0^\infty \frac{\arctan{kt}}{t(1+t^2)} \mathrm{d}t \\ J_2(k) & :=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln{(1\!+\!k^2t^2)}}{2(1+t^2)} \mathrm{d}t \\ P_s(k) & :=\int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1}\,\mathrm{d}t}{(1\!+\!t^2)(1\!+\!k^2t^2)} \\ L_s(k) & :=\int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1}\ln{t} \, \mathrm{d}t}{(1+t^2)(1+k^2t^2)} \end{split} $$ Then by direct definition : $$ J \!=\! \int_0^1 \!\mathrm{d}k \; \frac{J_1(k)}{k}-\frac{J_2(k)}{k}\!-P_1(k) \ln{k}+ P_3(k) k \ln{k} - L_1(k) + L_3(k) k + \frac{\pi}{2} (1+k)P_2(k) $$ Let us compute the $P_s(k)$ value only (for arbitrary $s$), note that : $$\frac{1}{(1+t^2)(1+k^2t^2)}=\frac{1}{1-k^2}\frac{1}{1+t^2}-\frac{k^2}{1-k^2}\frac{1}{1+k^2t^2}$$ Substituting that decomposition to the definition of $P_s(k)$ and by inserting the substitution $tk \rightarrow t$ into the second integral we can get the $s$-dependency out of both integrals, recollecting : $$P_s(k) =\frac{1-k^{2-s}}{1-k^2} \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1}}{1+t^2} \mathrm{d}t$$ Unfortunately this representation restricts the value of $s$ greatly, now $0<s<2$ Recall the definition of the beta function, using a simple tranformation $1+t^2 \rightarrow 1/t$ and applying the reflection formula one gets: $$ P_s(k) =\frac{1-k^{2-s}}{1-k^2} \frac{\pi}{2 \sin{(\frac{\pi s}{2})}} $$ For $s=1$ we have : $$P_1(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{1+k}$$ Using the L'Hopital's rule also extraction of $P_2(k)$ is possible : $$P_2(k) = - \frac{\ln{k}}{1-k^2}$$ From the definition is clear that $P_1(k)+k^2P_3(k)=\int_0^\infty \! \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{1+t^2} = \pi/2$, therefore : $$P_3(k) = \frac{\pi}{2k} \frac{1}{1+k}$$ Amazingly this result could be obtained also by evaluating the $P_s$ fromula at $s=3$ Evidently $L_s(k)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}P_s(k)$, performing that differentiation on the precomputed $P_s(k)$ one gets : $$ L_s(k) =\frac{k^{2-s} \ln{k}}{1-k^2} \frac{\pi}{2 \sin{(\frac{\pi s}{2})}} - \frac{\pi^2}{4} \frac{1-k^{2-s}}{1-k^2} \frac{\cos{(\frac{\pi s}{2})}}{\sin^2{(\frac{\pi s}{2})}} $$ Evaluation at $s=1$ gives: $$L_1(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{k \ln{k}}{1-k^2}$$ Using the same trick as in $P_3$ one can also evalute $L_3$ (However direct substitution also could have been done) $$L_3(k) = - \frac{\pi}{2k} \frac{\ln{k}}{1-k^2}$$ Let us now make a closer look at $J_1$ and $J_2$ integrals, as we can see, both at $k=0$ vanish, i.e. $J_1(0)=J_2(0)=0$ It seems natural to apply differentiation under the integral sign, performing that one can obtain : $$J'_1(k) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\mathrm{d}t}{(1+t^2)(1+k^2t^2)} = P_1(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{1+k} \\ J'_2(k) = k\int_0^\infty \frac{t^2 \mathrm{d}t}{(1+t^2)(1+k^2t^2)} = k P_3(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{1+k} $$ Using Fundamental theorem of calculus $f(x)=f(0)+\int_0^x f'(y) \mathrm{d}y$, resulting in : $$J_1(k)=J_2(k)= \frac{\pi}{2}\ln{(1+k)}$$ Putting all these informations ($J_s,P_s,L_s$) togehter, in $J$ we have now, due to "huge cancelerin" : $$ J = -\pi \int_0^1 \! \frac{\ln{k}}{1-k} \, \mathrm{d}k = -\pi \mathrm{Li}_2(1-k) {\Big|}_0^1 = \frac{\pi^3}{6} $$ Tracing back to the original definition of $J$ gives the desired result :) ...
