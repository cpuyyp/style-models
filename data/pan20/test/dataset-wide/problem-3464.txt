@Foobar provides an excellent reference. Whenever I am looking into a new area of economics, I generally check two places almost immediately (after google, of course :) 

I'm somewhat surprised that no one has linked to this paper: Backus, Routledge, and Zin (2004) Exotic Preferences for Macroeconomists (this version has some fixed typos, vs the NBER print). Their abstract is concise and extremely descriptive: 

On the behavioral side, it seems that people who make statements about preferences systematically choose differently than people who are forced to interact with the question more extensively before making choices. Specifically, when people people simply make a statement about a choice over risk vs simply "trying the risky choice out," the former display much more risk aversion than the latter. See this paper and the literature cited therein for examples of people displaying different risk aversion when asked vs when forced to interact with a simple simulation of a risky process. That paper itself aims to apply these insights to trying to help people make better investment decisions. So why do people appear to act differently than they say they will? ? There are many possible stories -- one possibility is that thinking is costly, and when you simply answer a question, you aren't actually doing an enormous amount of "thinking calculation" work. However when you must actually make a real choice, the payoff is eminent and you actively mentally chew on the problem more -- and having done more actual mental calculations, you come up with a different answer. This is likely an open research question which would benefit from more applied (experimental) work. A little further afield: one possibility on the theoretical side is that there may be people who don't fully order their preferences over different baskets of consumption. In simple verbal questions about choices, there may be some easy mis-communication about choices then. However when choices are actually observed, they can still be ordered under a particularly constructed preference ordering, such that they still fulfill the appropriate theoretical requirements to be useful for much of economic theory (eg. building utility functions). See the first question here, and answer here. This is actually a very fun result from basic preference theory. (I'll note that if the consumer agent is careful and truthful with their wording, there shouldn't be a problem between words/actions, as both should be useful in the above-referenced preference orderings. Also, the observer needs to be careful as well in this context.) 

I recommend Cities, Agglomeration and Spatial Equilibrium by Edward Glaeser. It introduces a monocentric city model (the Alonso-Muth-Mills model) which is discussed in this excellent paper. This looks at how housing prices and densities vary across a city, and how people of differing incomes sort spatially. This is the spatial equilibrium within cities. It then goes on to look at spatial equilibrium across cities (using the Rosen-Roback model), agglomeration economics, urban distress and public policy. It is mathematical, but does not include all steps in the derivations. My algebra and calculus is very good, but I have had trouble following all his steps. There are no exercises, but plenty of references to academic research that uses this theory. Glaeser has studied urban economics at Harvard and wrote an excellent book The Triumph of the City for the layman. 

Consider a mono-centric city, where all workers earn a wage $W$ in the centre of the circular city and rent out land $L$. Rent $r(d)$ and transport costs $t(d)$ vary with distance from the centre, $d$. Utility is constant by the spatial equilibrium assumption: 

I am reading 'Cities, Agglomeration and Spatial Equilibrium' by Ed Glaeser. People live in a monocentric city, where consumers of heterogeneous income $y$ work at the centre of the city. They buy $H(y)$ housing for a price $p(d)$ at distance $d$ from the centre, incurring transport costs $t(y)d$ as they commute to work. Consumers have a utility function: $U(C,H)=v(y - t(y)d - p(d)H(y),H(y))$ The budget constraint is: $C = y - t(y)d - p(d)H(y)$ where C is consumption net of transport and housing. The tangency condition implies: $\frac{U_1}{U_2} = p(d)$ where the subscript 1 denotes partial differentiation w.r.t. the first argument etc. By the spatial equilibrium assumption, $\frac{dU}{dd}=0$: there are no rents to be gained by changing location. $\frac{dU}{dd} = U_1(-t(y)-p'(d)H(y))=0$ $\therefore p'(d)=\frac{-t(y)}{H(y)}$: the price of housing declines with distance $d$. If the income elasticity of housing is greater than that of transport (i.e. $H(y)$ increases in $y$ more than $t(y)$ does), the rich (higher $y$) will live in the suburbs. Mathematically, the denominator gets larger than the numerator and the price gradient is less steep. The willingness to pay declines less with distance for the rich. The book then defines the income associated with each distance $y(d)$ and differentiates again to find the 2nd order condition, $p''(d)>0$. The book states that this is: $p''(d)=\frac{t(y)H'(y)-H(y)t'(y)}{y'(d)}>0$ But I believe this is incorrect an should be: $p''(d)=\frac{(t(y)H'(y)-H(y)t'(y))y'(d)}{H^2(y)}>0$ Am I correct? Also, how can you ignore the fact that $y=y(d)$ when calculating the 1st order condition then introduce it when you differentiate to find the 2nd order condition? Should you not state $U(y(d)-t(y(d))d-p(d)H(y(d)),H(y(d)))$ and differentiate twice? 

I often dip into "advanced undergrad" texts when I really want something broken down. Sometimes they deliver, sometimes not. With that beaming endorsement, I'll offer this suggestion: pair Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics, with Jeffery Parker's Coursebook (for Romer) for Macro Theory at Reed College. His coursebook takes the time to really work through some of the derivations in Romer carefully. Unfortunately I haven't used the NK portions so can't directly speak to them. 

This is only a quick answer, unfortunately. The key intuitive insight for Epstein-Zin is that they separate two distinct properties of preferences: risk aversion ("I'd prefer less uncertainty to more uncertainty*") and intertemporal substitution ("I may want to shift consumption forward or backwards in time**"). In the very popular Constant Relative Risk Aversion class of preferences (CRRA), risk aversion and intertemporal elasticity of substitution are tied together as inverses of one another. Recursive preferences, and specifically Epstein-Zin, use certainty equivalence in a clever way to split out the parameter which controls intertemporal substitution from the parameter which controls risk aversion in a static gamble. The static risk aversion parameter is embedded in the function which imposes the certainty equivalence, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter is imposed over today's certain consumption and the certainty equivalence value for utility of consumption tomorrow. That's my attempt to describe it intuitively/verbally. It's much more precise in mathematical form -- one good exposition that I like a lot is Francios Gourio's Asset Pricing field's course notes (EC745 is the course number). You can currently find these notes, titled "Lecture Notes on Macroeconomics and Finance Ec 745," on his website here; see section 8 on page 36. Work through the math a few times and hopefully it will suddenly "click." The analytical idea is really quite clever. Gourio goes on to discuss how to actually estimate these models, which is very helpful. (*The proper definitions involves preferences over "lotteries," but I think discussion of that would cloud what we care about here.) (** by a certain percent, as a function of the interest rate.)
