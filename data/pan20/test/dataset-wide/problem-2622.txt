The New Atheism seems to be promoted by Scientists or Philosophers pursuing a Physicalist agenda. The actual physics is silent about why or how the universe was created. Its also not generally noticed that the Physics of the very early Big Bang is highly speculative. It's impossible to say what new Physics are possible at such incredible density of both matter & spacetime. That their arguments are taken seriously is due to the high visibility & success of the Physicalist project in its manifold forms. This does not mean that it is correct. The argument that the universe created itself is not correct: a. One explanation put forward is that the universe begun as a quantum fluctuation. But this already posits a void where quantum laws are real. How can then one say it is void? The statement is paradoxical (without further elucidation). b. That Heisenbergs Uncertainty principle applied to time & energy seems to imply creation of energy is a standard popular interpretation, however I find this problematic given just how important conservation principles are in physics. Its also rife with philosophical interpretational issues. Taking Heisenberg principle seriously as uncertainty (which is how it was originally thought up) means you cannot be certain as to what energy is available in that time-frame. To ask for conservation at all times means that quantum reality has definiteness - and it is not clear exactly how this happens, if at all - at least in traditional frameworks like the Copenhagen explanation or its modern update Consistent Histories. Only something with creative agency can create - what the universe, at least in a physicalist narrative, is change from one moment to the next in line with Law. Now, what one notices is that the physical laws of conservation of energy & momentum involve time. If there is no time - there are no laws. Of course, one can posit that there are epochs before the one we are now. For example in Indian Cosmology we are now in the Kala Yug. I suspect it will be (relatively) easy enough to modify the standard Big Bang Cosmology so that there previous epochs to the one we are now in - simply because we have no empirical access to that point in time. These are actually very old arguments. For example in Christian Theology God created time & space. That is the Sun to regulate time, the earth as the theatre of action. One should understand this symbolically and not literally. As was already understood by the early Christian Fathers. Plato, in the Timaeus which describes his cosmology has the Demiurge inject order into the formless void. Unlike the New Athiests he is at least lacks the hubris to have: 

All of the above isn't really applicable to qualitative experience; as experience requires the self; Kant, however, does have a theory how experience is synthesised from intuitions (qualia); though this isn't theorised as infinitely small - it is qualitively so - along the lines that de Craema pointed out. 

Aristotle in the Nichomachean Ethics has a theory of the golden mean. The virtue that you have in mind is courage. Thus one who has no fear is not courageous but reckless; thus one who is always afraid is a coward; but one who is in part afraid and in part courageous and both parts being of roughly equal magnitude is courageous. Thus your daughter who has overcome her fear is courageous; and your daughter who shows no fear is reckless. Of course in the siutuation you have described fearlessness doesn't show itself to be reckless; but a small modification makes it much more vivid and apparent; for imagine the cockatiel unbeknownst to you had the ability to secrete a fatal poison through its talons...one ses immediately that the fearless child is reckless. 

Some doesn't mean all. It is usually taken to mean at least one. So if I have some cards in my hand - I have at least one; not all and nor none. 

Its generally well-known that Kant was responding, amongst other influences, to Humes critique of the empirical method on purely logical grounds. One could consider him as a modern-day Pyrrhonniste. The problem of induction is sourced from a brief argument in Humes Treatise, but the SEP shows a discussion in throughly analytic terms - Popper, carnap are mentioned for example. What was Kants response to the same question, if he in fact did respond to it; it seems likely that a response could be fashioned out of his philosophy on the basis of his categories as pure concepts of he Understanding. Question: How does Kant, or Kantians or neo-Kantians solve or understand the problem of induction? 

Given, that Arendt wrote this over fifty years ago and in passing, and given the accelerated and accelerating pace of technological change where all manner of automations have become distinct possibilities has anyone seriously explored how this ties in (or not) with Marxs prediction and how likely it will lift the yoke of neccessity that is labouring (as opposed to work)? 

Things that lack intelligence, that is what he calls natural bodies, like stones, planets, water act for an end, that is purposefully; and this is because they act, in the same way - that is regularly; he also notices things like water do not act regularly, but they almost do - that is despite their irregularity, there is in fact regularity in their motion. He also notes that they act in the best way. One can say that the best way is to follow a law, which is exactly what they do; they follow a natural law. A concrete example may help here: what is the purpose of a stone? It is to follow law - that is Gods law. And because it follows Gods law it is following the 'best' law. One might think of here of Liebnizs 'best of all possible worlds', or in natural science, the trajectories of particles follow the 'best' line - geodesic. The uncertainty in quantum motion isn't a problem here; as he explcitly says 'nearly always' in the same way. Variation is allowed as long as it is ordered. 

Why did the debate have such a tremendous effect on Levinas, and what was at issue in the debate that made it so famous? 

If a logic is temporal presumably conflicting accounts of the 'world' can be given. This seems the same territory that is occupied by paraconsistent logics. Hence the question: Are all temporal logics paraconsistent? Disclaimer: I know very little about either forms of logics. 

Possibly, one can add numbers to this list... And then, given the dichotomy between discovery and invention; it suggests that Heidegger tilts towards discovery rather than invention, in its inception ... 

It follows from this that he is dismissive about reducing science to a kind of linguistic analysis or pseudo-mathematical languages: 

The difference is between matching (cardinality) and ordering (Ordinals): Two sets such as {a,b,c} and {A,B,C} can be matched. The alphabetical ordering isn't important. Although you can count the elements in each set - they both have three - this isn't what should be done. First take any element from the first set, say 'b' and match it to one of the second set, say 'B'; carry on doing this until either set is empty (or both). If the first set is empty before the second then it is smaller in cardinality etc. In this sense matching is more fundamental than counting. In fact the cardinal of these two sets is 3. The reason why matching is more important than counting is that it can deal with infinite sets. Ordinals refer to how you order a set. THe two sets above have the same alphabetical order, and have an ordinal also called 3. The set {1,2,3,...} is usually called the greek lowercase omega, which i'll call w. then {1,2,3,...;1,2}=w+2 and {1,2,3,...;1,2,3,...;1,2}=w+w+3=2w+3 The cardinals are sparsely populated amongst the ordinals. For example there are many orderings (ordinals) that refer to aleph-1 the first uncountable cardinal. 

This is a semi-serious example because its not how real languages work. Suppose we can identify & list every fact of the world; now, in the past & the future. Then for every fact assign some arbitrary sign. we now have a 'language' which communicates every fact of the world and has no subjects & predicates! Of course, we only have very very partial knowledge of now, the past & future. So this doesn't really work. Of course if God was allowed in the picture He knows all this stuff - so He certainly can. On a more serious level I don't think you can - but I can't think of a good reason why. EDIT When rain falls there is no subject that causes it. It is a fact of the world that has no subject. You could say that 'Rain happens'. Rain here is not a subject. In french, one instead says 'Il fait pleut'. Here Il is an impersonal subject. It could refer to nature, or to God. Or it could simply have no referent and is used to give the sentence a S-V form. In mathematical logic, one has propositional and first order logics. (There are higher ones too). It seems 1-logic is the best place to explore the idea of S-V, where we identify a variable in a formula with the subject. 

as indeed, the three men above did. So how then does one distinguish primitive cosmology or find it? What are its markers? One cannot simply say primitive cosmology is that found in primitive cultures - or so it seems. 

Here two things are being said, that the sign 'dog' is understood as different from the sign 'cat'; and that to understand the sign 'dog' one must also understand the entire language; this, at first, appears odd - do we not understand the sign 'chien' as the french word for the sign 'dog'? And this without understanding the entire French Language? We do, of course; but one must understand that for humans that to know one language, is in some sense to know them all; for they all have structural similarities (this is Chomskys thesis). They add: 

The SEP entry on second order or higher logic in passing say that countable order logic is type theory. My impression that this is the type theory of the Principia (I may be wrong here). There is type theory in contemporary logic and computer-science, for example you have the typed lambda calculus, or typed first order logic. It only just occurred to me that this may be referring to the same concept - mainly because the 2nd order logic with Henkin semantics is equivalent to typed first order logic. This gives the impression that one can fold down the hierarchy of predicates in countable order logic to a kind of type theory. Is this on the right track? 

You're not the only one. In their article “1914: One or Several Wolves?” Deleuze & Guattari accuse Freud of being nothing more than a speculator who misunderstands the truth and goes on with meaningless associations. One thinks, et tu brute. However Gayatri Spivak acknowledges their poetic brilliance. The difficulty, is that they take a lot of philosophy - and specifically french philosophy for granted - this coupled to their use of neologisms mediated by the disciplines not naturally at home in academic philosophy and with their stated purpose to throw the reader (one might say the becoming-thinker) into things media res - in the middle of things, that is intermezzo - in between acts. 

the only 'proof' I know, is by essentially assuming it, which is just circular reasoning and unsatisfying. I rather suspect that physical laws only look turing computable at the scales we look at - and at their own scale, ie below or around planks distance they aren't. It would surprise me very much if nature didn't make use of quantum effects in the biology of a human being as nature is subtil. Finally the human mind in itself is not about computability.
