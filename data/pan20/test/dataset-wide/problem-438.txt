Not reliably. Exceptional cases have been noted by other answers and comments. The cube-square law is so fundamental to all science disciplines that it is hardly ever discussed any more. Mass increases with the cube of size, but strength only increases with the square of size. See this link for a starting point: $URL$ 

Short answer: the pancreas can't do it, no matter how much chitin it produces. Chitin is laid down in place, not circulated. Pancreatic chitin would not do the job because (best case) it would protect the pancreas, which is tiny and already buried deeply within the abdomen behind layers of intestine, from attacks that would be somewhat inconvenient (say the spear glances off the pancreas and penetrates the aorta and/or several sections of intestine) whether or not the pancreas itself was actually hit. 

Yes it is possible. Take Italy, which is named in the Bible (Acts 27). There are 20,000 unpopulated ghost towns in a small heavily populated country that is over 2,000 years old. Link: $URL$ 

There is an inherent misunderstanding of the "cave man" concept. It is true that various groups through history have chosen to live in caves, but that is because caves were more convenient and better than other types of shelter for at least part of the year. Today, we have space travel and paleolithic cultures of the same species living side by side on the same planet. People from paleolithic cultures are no less intelligent than those from more technological cultures. In peru, for example, if is possible for your birth family to live a paleolithic lifestyle (more likely hunter gatherer) but yourself to be a brain surgeon. At that point it becomes a preference, often for independence and simple lifestyle. Like the brain surgeon in Arequipa, who visits his family on vacation and uses a stone tipped arrow to fetch a monkey for supper, the crew of the starship are all professionals who strip down and go paleo when on their own time. "Primitive" is a lifestyle choice, not a state of being. 

Either of these could very well work inside eyes, though vision can be impaired if the coloring structures stand between the retina and the incoming light, of course. 

As you see there are conflicting goals here. If a planet has no atmosphere it's not that difficult to achieve such temperature extremes; Mercury, for example, has 

If your world is more or less like ours, and there is no magic, then your typical gryphons will never be able to fly. By typical I'm assuming you mean the size of big cats. There's a reason why large birds don't fly, or can only fly a bit by launching from high perches, or fly very clumsily, or rely mainly on soaring on thermal currents. It has to do with the strength of muscles v. the weight of those muscles and the bones that support them. Even forgetting those inconvenient facts, I foresee stability problems, as a typical cat-like animal would have a relatively big and heavy head on one end and bulky, heavy hindquarters on the other, which would make it very difficult for it not to lose balance if there's only one pair of wings in the midsection. I would advise that you gave the physical realism of the setting a big handwave and just go with the typical gryphons as you imagined them, unless you want them to do something specific with their bird tails. Gryphons belong in the fantasy genre anyway, so their presence should signal the reader that they shouldn't expect scientific accuracy. 

It has been done. This chain discusses some of the past experiments: $URL$ RPG7 uses a peizo electric primer, and Remington had a peizo electric primed cartridge for its 700 series, but the ammunition was cost prohibitive. $URL$ 

Moved from comment to answer because I've done more research. Try the biblical account of Sodom and Gomorrah, believed to be near the coast of the Dead Sea . The cities were destroyed by means of volcanism (fire and brimstone), and 4000 years later we still don't know where they are for sure. As an argument for the effectiveness of this approach, there is even debate as to whether the cities actually ever existed. The Dead Sea region is (in)famous for its sulfur (brimstone) smell. One of its names over the centuries was "The Stink Sea" because of it. While the region has been tectonically active in the past, there are no active volcanoes in the area in recent times. Igneous rocks are the norm around the dead sea, as are old volcanic craters. To achieve your ends using this example, you are looking for a pyroclastic volcanic event that has a sudden onset, creates pyroclastic projectiles sufficient to smash stone and clay homes to rubble, but does not have an associated lava flow or leave a new crater. It must maintain a temperature high enough to cremate bodies, but not so high as to fire the clay into ceramics, without deoxygenating the atmosphere for sufficient time to allow thorough cremation of the bodies. A short lived lava plume, which originally powered the eruption, sits beneath the two cities, raising their temperature for the duration of the event. This is distinctly different from pompei, where the environment was preserved by ashes and lava flow. Edit: Summary of some concerns raised in comments The veracity of the biblical account is not part of this discussion. For that, go to one of the religious (Christianity, Judaism, etc) or archaeology SE sites. This is not an attempt to prove that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by volcanic activity. It is an observation of a recorded event in a real location (Dead Sea valley) that matches the OP's question, and uses the real world geology of the area to establish a plausible natural event that a deity could use in the manner that OP requested. Setting aside the questions that are bigger than this discussion and off topic for worldbuilding, this event comes to mind because: 

Tides diminish in strength at rate proportional to the cube of the distance between the bodies, so the "distance" component of the equation is by far the most important. If the moon was captured recently (in geological terms) it will take some time to become tidally locked. It will take a lot longer if it was captured in a faraway orbit. And even longer if, when captured, it was spinning rapidly. Note, however, that as tidal acceleration begins to act, the slowing down of the moon's spin will induce friction. Expect to have a geologically active moon, churned by the planetary tides. For reference, an Earth-sized moon orbiting a Saturn-sized planet at one million km would take only about 12 days to complete an orbit. For a smaller gas giant (with the mass of Neptune), you could have an Earth analogue in orbit 2 million km away with a period of 76 days. Just play around with the numbers in the equations (WolframAlpha is your friend!). 

Better think of you'd want to have, and then check if it's possible. A Sun-like star would be the obvious answer but it depends on a lot of other factors. 

Take a look at the south of Argentine Patagonia, i. e. the southeastern end of continental South America, which lies roughly between the 40° and 50° S parallels (excluding the island of Tierra del Fuego). The Andes create a rain shadow that means that the prevailing westerly winds discharge most of their humidity on the Chilean side; on the Argentine side the places located right by the feet of the mountains get a lot of rain, but as you progress east the climate becomes extremely dry. This is the Patagonian Desert (in parts it is technically a steppe, I believe). It's the 8th largest in the world. North of Patagonia you have another desertic region, Cuyo, which is only livable because of extensive irrigation, and the arid parts of the Pampas. The fertile pampa regions for which Argentina is famous get their humidity mostly from two sources: an anticyclone in the south Atlantic which brings moist oceanic air from the south, and northerly winds from Brazil. The latter can only penetrate deep into the region because there are no significant mountain ranges between southern Brazil and northern Argentina; if there were, the arid climate would surely extend north for thousand of kilometers. The Atlantic anticyclones sometimes bring disastrous storms to the mouth of the Río de la Plata, and up the littoral region as far as 300 km north of Buenos Aires, but these are not persistent features. Based on this real-life example I would say your best bet is to make your continent very large, place high mountains in the way of the prevailing oceanic winds, and try to work out how to disrupt other sources of humidity. This might be impossible unless you want to go the Mordor way and box it all into a (totally unrealistic) rectangular mountain range. 

Karate student of 30 years - you cant. Knocking someone out requires striking the skull with sufficient force to bruise the brain. Brains have limited healing capacity. The brain is two hemispheres of fatty tissue connected by a short but thick segment of the same kind of tissue. The two hemispheres float independently in the cerebrospinal fluid, so blows from many angles will cause a shearing effect on the connecting tissue. Even injuries that have no immediate symptoms (i.e. no knockout) can express decades later because the injuries can be deep in the brain. Memory impairment, loss of self control, inability to process emotional and social cues are some of the long term symptoms. Edit: Causing unconsciousness by choking requires depriving the brain of oxygen sufficiently long for a critical percentage of the organ to shut down. The line between unconsciousness and death is very fine, and is the reason that police using "sleeper" holds usually end up in court. 

If they are surrounded by a refractive field that extends a fraction of an inch beyond their skin, then they could wear tight fitting clothes (spandex for example) and the field would cover them. They would not be able to wear arctic winter gear and maintain invisibility because that would require the refractive field to extend a couple of inches from their body. The refractive field would require significant initial amount of effort to establish, but thereafter would require only maintenance energy (comparable to a brisk walk). When the organs generating the refractive field are exhausted the refractive field would collapse and leave her visible. With training, as with any other physiological process, she can increase her limit through practice, nutrition, and rest.
