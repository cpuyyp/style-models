The Wikipedia article on Saul Kripke, referenced by @Chuck, actually links to a survey done of 600 philosophers asking Who is the most important philosopher of the past 200 years? The top 10 are: 

This is true because the projectile, fired from the same distance and at the same size target, will land fewer grazing hits (where a portion hits, but the midpoint misses) as a percentage of its total hits. Lets restructure your argument: 

I would have to agree with Cody's comment. I haven't read OPW, but did study his view briefly a few years ago. If I recall correctly, he effectively unilaterally proposes the plurality of worlds, and furthermore grants that the many different worlds that exist cannot, have never, and will never have even the slightest impact on each other. I think the reason people stare incredulously, like you say, is because there is hardly anything to say in response. There's nothing at all to refute, and absolutely nothing turns on Lewis being correct or not. Certainly it has an interesting parallel to modal language, but it's interesting in much the same way the personality a child ascribes to a stuffed animal is interesting - a curious thing to consider, but completely inconsequential, and hardly worth debating. 

Breaking an informal argument into explicit steps is only half the battle; you also have to define your terms. In particular, this will often reveal that an "obvious" assumption is anything but . . . . . . as it does in this case. You've edited to stipulate that statement (2) is justified by the definition of "maximally great being," so is implied by statement (1). OK, that's fine, but that depends on what you mean by "maximally great being." Whether or not the possibility of a maximally great being is plausible (let alone true) depends on what that phrase means precisely, and that's something you haven't even tried to do. So you can indeed make (2) justified by choosing a sufficiently strong meaning for "maximally great being," but then that makes (1) extremely objectionable: given that maximal greatness now quantifies over all possible worlds, why on earth should such a thing be possible at all? ("Given any thing, I can imagine a better thing . . .") And "nobody has successfully disproven the possibility of a maximally great being" is not a justification for (1) being a "reasonable" assumption at all. Nobody has yet disproved the possibility of a counterexample to the Riemann hypothesis; is that a reasonable assumption to make? 

I can't speak to the rigor of this survey, but perhaps it's a little more objective than just naming people, at the very least. 

Whether you ultimately agree with it or not, I feel that a study of modal logic, including David Lewis's (and others') notion of possible words is a valuable facet of a proper understanding of logic and metaphysics. However when I attempt to explain necessary truths (where one cannot imagine a world in which they would be false) I am often met with some form of the following criticism: 

I think the fact that the list of adjectives fails to determine if the character is lawful or chaotic speaks not to a problem with the system, but instead simply to the fact that ones alignment is not determined by their adjectives. I feel like those adjectives could just as well be applied to an evil person as to a good person, and that you could construct a character who fits all those adjectives and has any of the nine alignments you chose. To your question about philosophical mappings, I think the very point of the alignment system is to map philosophies to easy to remember terms, and I suspect one could go through the Normative Ethics and associate each alignment with a more technical term. One interesting note regarding the disconnect between the adjectives (effectively, values) and the alignment (effectively, philosophy) is this speaks to part of the problem in modern politics. A group of people can get together and agree freedom, personal happiness, low crime rates and good education are all important, and yet still bicker endlessly on how to actually attain those things. 

The converse is extremely false! First of all, note that most structures in predicate logic don't come from frames-with-valuations - e.g. in what sense can you think of a field as coming from a frame-with-valuation? Even once we restrict attention to structures which come from frames-with-valuations in the above sense, propositional modal logic is still very weak: for example, how would you try to express the predicate logic sentence 

Let me contrast two different foundational goals (or directions, since there's no expectation of eventual completion) for formal logic: 

OK fine, a comment on the last sentence: in mathematics people do prove "conditional" results, e.g. "If the Riemann hypothesis is false, then [something]." However, the hypothesis is part of the result: we do not claim to have proved [something]! So you can perfectly reasonably claim the conditional result "If the existence of a maximally great being is possible, then there is a maximally great being," but (a) that's not much of a surprise, and (b) you'll still need to define "maximally great being." 

You seem to be presuming that anyone who is "suicidal" should have successfully killed themselves. There is no such casual link - having suicidal thoughts and even attempting suicide, does not mean that one is predestined to do so. Can one violate predestination by simply changing their mind? Surely it's not that easy. Before exploring whether your example breaks determinism you need to establish more clearly what it would mean for any example to do so. Just having a though and not going through with it in no way disproves (or proves) determinism. Remember that your thoughts are (determinism posits) the result of electrochemical interactions in your brain. Just like your actions, these can be causally linked back to the beginning of time in a purely physical universe. There's no requirement that Thought A lead to Action B. The standard solution to disproving determinism and/or establishing free will is to identify something "extra" about free-beings, such as a soul, that transcends physics. If your philosophical thesis (or religion) grants humans' souls then humans are not limited by physical limitations like causality. Unless you're willing to grant humans some extra-physical characteristic it will be difficult to disprove determinism. 

in the context of propositional modal logic? All this is to say that, compared to predicate logic, propositional modal logic is extremely weak. However, in many senses this can be viewed as a positive: philosophically we may doubt the "definiteness" of predicate sentences in general (stemming from a doubt about the meaningfulness of iterated quantification over the entire domain), while having much more faith in sentences expressible in a particularly nice fragment of it; mathematically, modal logic and its variants exhibit a number of nice properties (e.g. decidability) which full predicate logic does not have, making it interesting from both pure and applied standpoints. 

Now this translation is faithful in the following sense: if every world of a frame-with-valuation (W, R, V) satisfies phi, then the associated structure M satisfies "forall x, phi'(x)." There are other senses in which this translation is faithful, as well; propositional modal logic can, in every sense, be faithfully be embedded in predicate logic. (I've focused on frame-oriented modal logic, but this really extends further.)
