So... I am not the biggest fan of these ideas where you should necessarily set up office hours or demand a pay raise or what have you. I mean, they do have a kernel of truth to them but the kernel is this: 

I agree with others that this is not the greatest question in the world, particularly when you are, as an interviewer, speaking to people severely motivated to put their best foot forward at all times. I think that this approach answers what the interviewer is asking ("what, in your mind, are the drawbacks of hiring you?") without actually providing a current weakness/delta. The trick is to not just sound self-aware but to sound self-aware enough that not only do you know where your weaknesses lie but to demonstrate that you're working on making them not weaknesses. 

I'm not a lawyer but I do know some and also people who have had to fight non-coms and the gist of them appears to be that 99% of the time they're all but completely unenforceable. If you're signing something that says that you can't take specific corporate secrets from the company and divulge them to a competitor when you leave, that's one thing. But these all-encompassing varieties of non-coms seem to be out there only to intimidate workers who don't want to hire a lawyer or haven't thought about it that much. The other thing to watch out for - and again, I want to reiterate that I'm not a lawyer so take what I say with the layman's perspective that it is - is that reciprocity is the backbone of all contracts and also all clauses of contracts. What are you getting in exchange for that non-compete? "We will hire you" is not enough. They need to spell out what you're getting in return. I know a person who, to take it a step further, had an advanced degree that made them only fully employable in a specific industry, and when their (then former) employer attempted to sue them for breaking their non-com, the judge enforced some reciprocity of his own: you either pay this person for the period of time your contract forces them to be out of work or else you drop your lawsuit. I'm not saying you'd be getting anywhere near the same thing but I think it does point to that very specific issue with non-coms. I would feel free to hear them out and if you have reservations about the non-com, leave it to yourself. If this company wants to force you to sign an unenforceable document and you otherwise like the company, I would feel free to make them feel that false sense of security. Perhaps, if you had a friend or family member who is an attorney or else wouldn't mind spending a couple hundred dollars up front for an hour or two of consultation, get someone who knows law to read it for you and tell you how badly you're on the hook. Chances are, you're not going to be, and to take it a step further, if you are, you probably already have an idea of how far on the hook you'd be. 

I'm not privy to employer negotiations but I've worked as a subcontractor, and depending on the particular niche you're talking about, the main contractor simply may not have anyone available with the required skillset for the job. However, they may know a company who has supplied them with good people in the past and are willing in this case to take a smaller cut in exchange for getting the job done (in fact, often they might end up ahead of the game since they often don't have to take care of the subcontracted employee's benefits and the like). From the standpoint of the company, they just want someone who can do the job. It's not that they require the contractor to provide one of their people, it's that the fact that the employee is contracted out to that company represents one less hoop they have to jump through to determine whether or not the person is qualified or not. I'm not going to say that bad contractors never slip through the cracks here, and that in some part is what the interview process is for, but at least you are dealing with people who have presumably been vetted by someone else before you even begin talking to them. In the end, my experience with most companies is that even if they don't know that a person was hired via a subcontractor rather than being a direct employee, if the person hired can actually do their job that's all that matters. I should add a disclaimer that I work in IT, an industry where there can be a high variability in competence on the one hand but often a great need to move forward with a project quickly on the other. In many cases the cost of bringing on an incompetent employee long enough to "ramp them up" into competence or figure out that they can't cut it and then hiring someone else is not significantly greater than employing the tactic of interviewing person after person for several months until someone they can be assured is competent out of the gate (this assuming that we live in a world where you can discern competence from an interview or, really, anything but actually watching a person work for several weeks, which of course, we don't, but for the purposes of the argument...). Either way, what you primarily wasted was time. $100 an hour is a drop in the bucket compared to the costs of releasing a product 6 months late, and there is always the possibility that you'll find a good contractor using the first tactic. 

If you really and truly want to go up to your bosses and ask for a raise with the implied threat that you'll leave if you don't get it, my suggestion is to at least take a look at the job market first. In fact, the best way to leverage yourself into a raise isn't "haha I have you guys over a barrel", it's "I have found that other people in my position are being paid $5k more a year than I currently am". The latter is information your boss can take back to their bosses if they need to go through an approval process. The former is kind of a neon sign saying "once it is in your best interest to do so, you need to get this person out of a position where they can make demands at us, because they seem to like to do this at inopportune times". In general, it's good to have a backup plan for if/when your boss says "no" and work from there anyway. If you don't have one - if the market for your skillset is saturated and you're already overpaid compared to your cohort, for example, you should assume that your boss is aware of this. If the extra work is bad to the point that you'd still consider another job, well, that's your backup plan. You don't necessarily need to get all the way into the interview process at another company to leverage your situation but I've done that before and, so long as your boss doesn't react to it by preemptively firing you, it's not a terrible way to go. To your third question: I don't know what the particulars of your situation are but the answer is almost invariably "yes". Yes, you are replaceable. The good news is, in most situations so is your company.
