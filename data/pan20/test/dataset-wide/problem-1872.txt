Being unemployed is always a scar on a person's resume. Being employed in a different field should only be beneficial towards a person's resume. When you're unemployed the main benefit is that you don't have to take days off when you go to interviews for jobs you DO wish to have. However, aside from this it's not very useful. Being employed as a waiter for example could indicate you as customer friendly. Being employed as a super market stock filler could indicate teamwork. These are all competencies that an employer appreciates. It's always a good idea to fill up any unemployment holes that you make. 

Being an intern and being an employee are obviousy two VERY different things. If I am to assume that you're interning at the company because your studies require you to have an internship, then there "should" be an internship contract. Usually they are given to you by school to be signed by both you, the company and the school. If it says in there that you're supposed to have 40 hour working weeks, then you're obviously working too much. If it doesn't state anything like that in any of the contracts you signed. Then things get a bit complicated. Because you're an intern, you most likely (I'm not sure) get paid a certain fixed amount regardless of how many hours you work. So working more hours has no advantage for you in any way (other than pleasing the employer). If you don't want to work more than 40 hours then you should tell them that you wish to make the hours that were agreed upon. you could say that you don't mind deviating from this on occasion. But if it becomes a habit like it has right now, You should try to refer to the contract with the agreed upon time. Talk to them about it politely, if they insist on you working more hours despite all this. Possibly contact your school (assuming this internship is part of your school degree). If this is not part of your school degree, then I would consider looking for other companies if this company doesn't care about your working hours/mental sanity. 

You should just quit. Probation period works both ways - it is not just the company testing you out, it's also you testing the company, and obviously the company has failed your test. Six months probation period sounds German. So if you wait to long for the company to implement changes probation might end and you will most likely find yourself at the wrong end of the customary German three month notice period. Do you really want to be bogged down for three quarters of a year ? So quit - this is not you being spoilt, this is what a probation period is for. Also that way the company can look for a replacement and does not have invest any more money into an unhappy employee. Plus with markets being as they are at the moment you should be able to find a new job quickly, so there is not point in dithering. It's just when you find that being unhappy in your job becomes a habit that you should reconsider if the problem is with you and not with the companies you work for, but for now looking for a better fitting opportunity seems the thing to do. 

Leave him be, and get to know more about his headphones in a positive way. unless he deliberatly goes towards your client's working enviroment and THEN use his headphones, I see no problem (even then it's just a bit akward). What happens in your own working enviroment is up to you. It may seem a bit strange for when your client looks around your working enviroment, however there are plenty of valid reasons he could make for using them that don't need to offend the client. For example: 

"Work" does not imply having "found" a job. It implies you have a job and a written contract. In these contracts there's a starting date. If the company pushes you back, you should still get paid based on the start date that you recieved in the contract. Seeing as you don't get paid despite having found the job. This simply implies that You do NOT have the job. So keep looking for a job untill the very moment you have a WRITTEN contract with a clear starting date. When I was initially looking for a job I applied for over 10 companies within a single week. At the end of the week I had 3 job offers but only 1 of them gave me a contract to look at. Even when you recieve this contract you're not hired. Only when it's written by both you and the company will the contract be valid. If I wanted to sign this contract and the company asked me to wait for a while, I would have looked at the other offers I recieved and would try to get a contract from them. so I could compare them. I'll emphesise something since I'm still not clear on what has happened. You seem to have recieved a "contract" with a "tentative" starting date. To me this does NOT equal as a contract. This merely sounds like a way for them to bind you without giving you anything in return. A good contract requires a fixed starting date unless it is a contract between 2 companies. Seeing as you're going to be an employee, this is not the case. If they were to push the starting date by 6 months, they will not have paid you for that amount of time. As soon as you refuse their offer and work somewhere else they will yell at you and say you had a contract with them to work for them. THAT is the kind of contract you signed. Luckilly you're somewhat covered for these kind of shenanigans. At the moment where the tenative starting date has passed and you're still not working due to their fault, your contract will need to be changed. At this point you're allowed to deny these changes. and can therefor get hired somewhere else. So let me get back to the emphasis on what I meant. "No written contract with a clear starting date = no job" As for background checks requiring you to have a tenative starting date instead of fixed is also incorrect. The company can simply make a contract where it states that the contract will become invalid the moment the background checks do not confirm what you have told the company through your CV. Meaning you don't NEED a tentative starting date. that company is either screwing with you, or they don't know what they're doing. 

There is a law in Germany, which somewhat unsurprisingly called the "Bundesurlaubsgesetz" (Federal Law on Vacation). Rather more suprisingly the law does not say you have to take vacation at all - you have to claim your vacation days within a given year, if you do not you forfeit your claims. There are very few exceptions, the one pertaining to your case is that vacation days can be moved to the next year if it is determined that your employer for some valid reason cannot do without you (i.e. contracts to fullfill that require full manpower). You can try to convince your boss that this is case, however at the end of the day it is his call, not yours. Employers usually loathe to permit this, because it affects the balance sheet (if that is the right word - they have to put money aside to account for the case that they might be unable to give you the missing vacation days, so that goes down on the side of the liabilities). However if you need to finish a project the benefits might outweigh the cost, so your boss might be okay with it (in fact moving vacation days isn't that rare in Germany). If you move vacations days to the next year you have to take them within the first three months of the year, else you forfeit your claims (as far as the law is concerned, the company might decide to handle this differently). Usual disclaimer, I am not a laywer, I just googled one on the internet (plus, some personal experience). 

I'm going to awnser this question based on the information before the edit, as I personally feel it was still vital to the awnser. Have you heard of Pseudocode? When I got hired for a software job I only managed to get half the tasks working. Mainly because I had to code in a language I never saw before and the syntax was different (I told them beforehand and they told that wouldnt be a problem). So for every piece of code that I couldnt get working I wrote some pseudocode. example: 

The things you lied on aren't as bad as you make it out to be. Yes you've been done like Kilisi said. However I think it can still be saved. It's not a huge leap to go from jr software developer to software developer. After all, a jr software developer is ALSO a software developer. so on this part, you haven't really lied. Next, the time you've worked at the company is still accurate, it simply did not include the setting in which you worked for part of that time. If I was an interviewer and I noticed this, I'd find it somewhat more forgivable as the quantity of work you delivered is true and it also correctly describes the things you've done during that time. Whether it was an internship or not, it's still work. If it were any other kind of details, you'd have been screwed. However these things seem fairly innocent. 

While lack of formal education in the field might not be a deal breaker (e.g. I studied education and I implement Web Analytics Systems for a living) lack of relevant experience probably is. "I believe" is not going to convince anybody. You must be able to make a case that your previous work has prepared you for the challenges of the higher position. I frankly have no idea what being a "fiber optic planner" entails in its job description, but typically higher paying jobs involve skills beyond the technology (being able to talk to and negotiate with clients, managerial skills etc.), so you need to be sure you are in some way prepared for that. Else you'd have to take the long way and somehow aquire the necessary skill set (night school, online studies etc.) and then try again to apply. 

There may be company cultures where talking about personal issues is looked at as a sign of weakness, and if you work in a place like that you might want to keep quiet. However, based on personal experience, I would say that talking helps. My wife suffered from complications from surgery last year, was in a coma for two months and is now permanently disabled. Caring for her would be a full time job by itself, and I have to do it in addition to my day job. Also of course this affects me psychologically. I have been quite upfront with all of this with both my superiors and colleagues, since this rather affects my performance. And while I still have (obviously) to do the job I was hired for the company has been looking for ways to accommodate my situation, and my colleagues now at least understand why I'm constantly looking tired and show some understanding. Had I kept quiet that would not have happened. So I'd say mention it at least - at the worst nothing will come off it, but maybe somebody is willing and able to assist you with your situation (but remember that other people have a life, also, so don't take it as an excuse to talk constantly about your issue). 

Lets start here by answering as if you were alone. Yes, in Europe they will ask for a LOT of personal questions in order to figure out your personality. Also, a lot of interviews will be somewhat informal sometimes and they will try to have a conversation with you. This means they could ask a lot of things that are unrelated towards the job. However it's also known that you can at all times state that you'd rather not talk about those things. Many of the questions that they have asked you did in my opinion cross the line of what I'd allow them to ask of me. So this is most certainly not normal. Yet some interviewers will ask them regardless. For example, asking if you have other interviews planned for other companies I wouldn't mind answering. I would always say yes, even if I don't. However, to tell them which companies crosses the line for me. They can ask me that AFTER they have hired me(written contract etc etc.), not before. Many of the questions I've read felt like they were looking down on the interviewee and that in it's own is unacceptable. 

Let your HR departement manage that. Unless your former colleague has completely changed the field he will now be working for a competitor and might not even be allowed to help you (and when in doubt HR is better prepared to handel legalities that might have to be dealt with). Even if he wants to help you cannot expect him to work for free. You are probably not authorised to offer him payment, so again, let HR handle this. Or even better, don't do this at all. It is unlikely that after 6 months he remembers enough details to be of much help, and nobody I know of likes to be stalked by their former workplace. 

Compared to telling them that their ideas are not great, Powerpoint looks at least like it won't be your biggest problem. I can just assume that you intend to phrase this more diplomatically. But while Powerpoint in an interview is not unheard of it would be unusual to simply start a presentation when your bosses expect they will be conducting a more traditional format. To answer that part of the question I would suggest you announce your intention to have a presentation ready. If they are okay with the idea it might actually be well received (as is shows preperation), if you spring a surprise presentation on them they will quite probably be annoyed and shoot yor down for that reason alone. 

If the deciding factor for the company to reduce the offered pay is your age, then yes, you were discriminated based on your age. The thing however that needs to be taken into account is whether it is truly the age that they are looking at or whether it's your years of experience. Fact is, a 25 year old employee "can" be just as good or maybe have MORE experience than for example a 50 year old employee. There will still be differences however. If this company mentions to you that they wanted an older employee because he will have more experience in working in general (non-related work) then this would result in you "not" being discriminated against based on age. However if they offer a lower salary based on the policy or belief that younger employers should be paid less. Then yes, you are being discriminated against. They gave an offer towards an employee who met and exceeded the criteria they were asking for. To fall back from this based just on a person's age is in my opinion immoral and unethical. Can you actually do something against this? I don't know but I'm leaning towards no. Nevertheless you should look for advice from professionals/experts on this matter as @JJosaur suggested in his answer. 

I know a few companies that buy carbon offsets for every mile they make their employees travel. I can't really say if this is feasible for you (I think most options are targeted at really large companies), but if this is about environmental concerns it might be a reasonable compromise. 

If you divulge information on an ongoing lawsuit your current employer might decide to sue you (e.g. if this leads to loss of business - they might then try to blame bankruptcy at you. That your grievances with your employer are factual does not necessarily help in that case). So you don't bring it up. Either the interviewer does not know about the lawsuit, in which case there is no need to bring it up, or they do know about it, in which case they'll understand why you cannot talk about it (plus they'll probably would not want to hire somebody who is indiscreet and thus a legal risk, so it is in your best interest not to bring it up).
