Note: In the link Three Cardinal Discourses of the Buddha, the following teachings are translated incorrectly: 

You & nobody else can benefit from meditation if it is believed: "I am a bad person". Therefore, I recommend two options: (1) Ignore the thought & focus on your breathing, until you start to believe: "I can be a calm person". Otherwise: (2) Address the thought & change it to: "I am not a bad person. I am just an ordinary person. I am a person who wants to improve my life & be a better person." The Buddhist path has more components than only focusing on breathing. The other components include to stop doing harmful (negative) actions & to develop love & compassion towards yourself. 

In the good old days, we all piled into these old wooden dorms, sleep on the floor & use this old toilet in the forest. At least recently there is an individual wooden bed. 

It is very difficult to deal with attachment (clinging; egoism) if one has not dealt with craving. If (the urge; drive; energy of) craving is not extinguished then attachment will keep raising its ugly head. It is like having craving symptoms towards a drug. To resolve this, the craving symptoms must be destroyed via cold turkey, otherwise the mind will continue to be tormented by the craving symptoms. To attempt to be non-attached towards craving symptoms is a difficult endeavor because the craving symptoms themselves, whilst not being suffering itself, still have a tormenting or oppressive quality. MN 148 is the only sutta I am aware of that mentions non-attachment towards craving. Most suttas mention the extinguishing of craving. Or many men become monks but fail due to not being able to overcome sexual desires. Abstinence from sexuality & attempts at non-attachment towards sexual desire generally do not extinguish the sexual desire (craving). Thus, the life of a monk is difficult for them. That said, attachment (upadana) is mentioned in the 1st noble truth as suffering itself. By using the word 'sankhittena', the 1st noble truth summarises all suffering as attachment (to the five aggregates), such as described in MN 140: 

This reality is most well-known by ordinary people when they experience sexual orgasm & also when women complete (the trial of) childbirth. Mystics can also use psychic powers to send thought messages & emotions into the minds of other people. This will also cause the earth element within the bodies of those other people to shake. Many reputed arahants have passed away in Thailand yet Thailand does not have earthquakes. Sorrow is often connected to joy. When ordinary people think of the passing of enlightened beings, both the joy & sorrow in their minds causes the earth element in their physical bodies to shake. The above said, if what is written in the Maha-Parinibbana Sutta is literally true then Jesus Christ must have also been a Buddha because the Bible states: 

No. Wise reflection means to think or ponder. It is wisdom faculty rather than concentration faculty. Stream-entry obviously occurs via direct seeing or vipassana rather than via wise refection. 

The Buddha did not speak English, German or Russian therefore it is difficult to find translated instruction that is not subject to 'interpretation' (since there is not one well-known translator that has translated the instructions 100% accurately). If you want to know exactly what the Buddha taught, you must use logic & intelligence ('wise reflection': 'yoniso manasikara') to discern his teachings. For example, in his 1st sermon on the Four Noble Truths (note: linked translation is not 100% accurate), the Buddha taught: (1) suffering is to be comprehended; (2) the origin of suffering, namely, craving leading to self-becoming, is to be abandoned. (3) the cessation of suffering, namely, the cessation of craving, is to be realised. (4) the path to the cessation of suffering, namely, the noble eightfold path, is to be developed. Therefore, what is 'suffering' (which the Buddha summarised as egoistic 'attachment/grasping' to the five aggregates) is something that must be comprehendible. It follows common ideas such as 'life is suffering' or 'the five aggregates (body, feeling, perception, mental forming & consciousness) are suffering' is not something comprehendible therefore do not form part of the instruction. The instruction is to comprehend that egoistic attachment/grasping ('upadana') is suffering. The clearest & most obvious instruction that represents a radical change in behavior is that of 'craving is to be abandoned'. In other words, the noble eightfold path, including the meditation components, is obviously not to be developed using craving. Practising forms of meditation, such as watching breathing, with craving, is obviously contrary to the instructions. This is why many meditation instructions state the mindfulness & concentration developed is based in giving up craving & letting go of attachment (i.e., 'relinquishment'). As for the other components of noble eightfold path, such as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 5th, they are very straightforward. 

It doesn't take long. It only takes a long time for ordinary people who have lots of instinctual drives ("hindrances"), such as sexual lust, fear of death & selfishness. 

If we all were really reincarnated souls then we would all remember our past lives or we would all be born with knowledge & experience from our past lives. But, unfortunately, we are all born ignorant, like a blank slate with some natural instincts, and we all must learn how to live & survive in life, as though we all started out anew & fresh. Some translators of old Buddhist scriptures use the word "transmigration" but this is just a mistranslation. Similar to the Jewish dissenters, later-day Buddhists created many ideas about reincarnation & even ideas about how 'consciousness' (which is mere sense cognition) is reborn, which probably explains why Buddhism become extinct in India, since it became the same as Hinduism. Even in the Pali suttas, there are maybe a dozen suttas from thousands (such as the Chariot Maker sutta) that state the Buddha had a literal past life. These suttas are questionable as to their authenticity given they contradict the Khajjanīya Sutta. 

Th word 'dharma' or 'dhamma' means 'that which supports' and is used universally in India. The term 'dhamma' in Pali Buddhism is translated in different ways such as 'phenomena', 'nature', 'law', 'truth', 'path', 'skilful practices', 'fruit', etc, because each of these are things that 'support' the spiritual life. The term 'Buddha-Dhamma' refers to the dharma of the Buddha, i.e., the Buddha's understanding & method to support life so life is free from suffering & problems. 

Your question gives the impression that you have not developed meditation within a certain teaching/practise tradition for a prolonged period but have been learning theory from different random sources. If that is true, your question thus gives the impression the various theories of meditation have confused you. In the West, there is a popular form of 'meditation' from Burma that is erroneously called 'vipassana', where practitioners are preoccupied with noting thoughts, images or sensations. This is so because practitioners have many distractions so this method accommodates & attracts those kinds of practitioners. In formal Buddhist theory (such as in the old scriptures) having few thoughts, images or sensations is a good thing. In formal Buddhist theory, samatha & vipassana are developed in tandem (concurrently), with samatha predominating in the beginning & vipassana developing naturally as samatha deepens. In formal Buddhist theory, 'vipassana' does not mean noting thoughts, images or sensations. 'Vipassana' means 'seeing clearing' the impermanence & selflessness of phenomena. For example, on a very basic level, the mind can develop samatha by continuously observing the breathing in a balanced equanimous way. As the mind is continuously observing breathing, it will naturally notice the breathing is impermanent; in that the breathing comes & goes; that it becomes short & long; that the various breaths have different textures & qualities, such as being smooth, rough, agitating, soothing, etc; ultimately to the point of seeing clearly it is the body that breathes (rather than "I" or the "self" that breathes). Seeing clearly the impermanence & selflessness of the various breathing ins & breathing outs is real vipassana. Then as samatha develops & deepens, certain feelings of rapture & joy will predominate in the mind. When these feelings predominate, they will also be objects of vipassana, in that the rapture & joy will be seen as dependently arising, impermanent & selfless. Then as samatha deepens, more profound vipassana will occur in different ways. Therefore, in my opinion, you should consider developing samatha more because this leads to calmness & non-confusion. You should forget about thoughts & images because these are actually hindrances to meditation. The 'sensations' that are ideally observed are the subtle sensations within the breathing; the sensations of the breathing being smooth, rough, etc. Then later, as samatha is profoundly developed, the mind observes the sensations of rapture & joy that arise from the calming of the breathing. After this, the mind will be very clear & can discern the 'dependent origination' of thoughts, consciousness, other mentality & sense objects. The classic original Buddhist path is based on developing samatha. Further, based in what you described in your question, the impression is your mind is predisposed or inclined to develop samatha, since it has equanimity & few attachments. 

In the Pali suttas, there are scores of suttas about Dependent Origination which take the classic form of the 12 links, the benchmark being SN 12.2. In the Digha Nikaya, there is the Maha-Nidana Sutta, called the 'Great Cause'. I find the name of the sutta strange since if it is 'great', why are there only 9 links instead of 12? While there are many suttas containing less than 12 links, it seems strange the Maha-Nidana Sutta omits the six sense spheres, which the Buddha described as one of his core teachings in AN 3.61 & are central to so many suttas on Dependent Origination (such as MN 18, MN 38, MN 148, etc). More importantly, the Maha-Nidana Sutta defines consciousness & nama-rupa differently to other suttas. In the Maha-Nidana Sutta, consciousness (which is only mental cognition in other suttas) is said to descend into the womb of a mother. Nama-rupa has a Brahmanistic meaning of 'naming-forms'. Also, 'birth' refers to the birth of different animals & creatures rather than the birth of "beings" or "satta". SN 23.2 refers to a "being" as a mind that is attached to the five aggregates as "self". It is doubtful birds & snakes conceive the five aggregates as "self" or generate "self-views" of "beings" (as described in SN 5.10). Are there any compelling reasons or grounds why Buddhists should accept the Maha-Nidana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya as the words of the Buddha? 

However, to assert there are no objects "out there" independent of the mind goes too far. It is an extreme view because to assert there are no objects independent of mind asserts the mind is 'God' or 'Brahma'; that the mind is the 'Creator' of the external world. The Pali scriptures state, for example, the Laws of Nature exist "out there" regardless of whether they are known by a human mind or not, as follows: 

The original Indian Buddhist art (below) did not depict a 'personal form' but usually showed a wheel, tree, footprint or empty space as a symbol of the Buddha. This is probably because the Buddha famously said: 

The Fire Sermon describes the liberation that results from clearly seeing the 'fire', burning or oppressiveness of lust, hatred & delusion. In the text, the word translated as "estrangement" is 'nibbindaṃ', which also means 'disgust' or 'revulsion'. The quote below explains the word 'nibbindaṃ': 

More primitive life forms, such as worms or fish, have a nervous system, therefore their nervous system experiences physical pain. Dogs are probably more complex and have emotions such as lust, love, emotional attachment; that makes them experience emotional sorrow & unhappiness. However. as we can directly experience, homo sapiens (people) have the egoistic attachment (upadana) of self-identity (sakkaya ditthi), which is born from thought conception. This upadana of sakkaya ditthi is the 'suffering' ('dukkha') Buddhism seeks to eliminate. I think it is a fair assumption worms & fish cannot create the upadana of sakkaya ditthi; and probably also dogs. 

In Thailand, there was a very famous monk who was chosen to represent Thailand in 1954 at the 6th Buddhist council in Burma who did not believe in rebirth (and who many Thai puthujjana considered to be a heretic & sutta-cutter). His life ended by natural causes at 87 years old. A certain Sangharaga (Supreme Patriarch) who taught 'heaven & hell' where cultural beliefs that represent 'ancient geography' lived for 100 years, as follows: 

Was the Buddha judging people unfairly here because his mind was defiled (polluted) with self-conceit; narcistically believing he was better or superior than others? Was the Buddha polluted by the fetter of conceit (mana)? 

The doctrine of 'paramithä' is not found in the suttas but found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries (Wikipedia). However, the basic requirement for giving (dana) & morality (sila) to be excellent or 'higher' ('parama') than ordinary is found in the suttas. For example, AN 7.49 lists seven types of giving (dana), where six types of giving are based in views & self-views that can lead to suffering. Where as the 7th kind of giving, namely, giving for the purpose of beautifying & supporting the mind (citta) rather than giving to beautify & support the 'self' (atta) is said to lead to non-returner. Therefore, such giving can obviously lead to stream-entry. Also, since the end of MN 118 states each of the seven factors of enlightenment has 'giving up' ('vossagga') as its primary quality, this shows the ability to give open-handedly or unselfishly is an important factor for stream-entry. As for morality (sila), many suttas (such as SN 55.1 & MN 6) make it clear that morality must be higher than ordinary for the attainment of stream-entry. 

~~ And what is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness. 

Hunger is created by the biological mechanisms of the physical body, which creates hunger pain. If the mind chooses to starve to death, the hunger pain will exist until death. Thus, the hunger is not created by the mind. It is created by the body. 

Therefore, when you say: "I feel pretty strong sensations of pleasure most of the time, as long as I'm not there and not planning to do something", this is the 'natural' path to jhana the Lord Buddha described in SN 48.10. This is similar to the Zen masters, for example: 

When I was a boy, there was a very beautiful girl at our school. Later, she became a model & posed in pornographic magazines. A few years later, she committed suicide. When I worked in a meditation centre in Asia, I met a beautiful teenage girl who worked as a prostitute making lots of money. She had many problems in Asia and was brought to the meditation centre by a lady. She never stopped crying during the meditation retreat & when she returned home to Europe, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. I also met another young lady who worked in pornography. I was was very nice to her and she became obsessed with me & would not leave. The nuns in the monastery had to take her to the airport and send her home to Europe. It was as though no man has ever loved her in her life. I can tell many other stories like this from my life experience. Metta-karuna (loving-kindness, compassion & non-harming) is the best way to overcome lust. It is 'ignorance' that goes to wrong websites because ignorance has the wrong view that the people on those websites are doing pleasurable things that bring happiness. In reality, the prostitutes & performers on those wrong websites, particularly the women, are suffering. Many are addicted to drugs & alcohol. Many of these women & men have committed suicide or died of drug overdose & sexually transmitted diseases. The woeful states taught by the Buddha of animal realm (immorality; ignorance), hungry ghost (craving addiction) & hell (suffering & torment) do not necessarily exist after death. These woeful states exist in the here-&-now. The victory that can occur is over 'ignorance' ('not-knowing'; 'wrong view').
