Today, one of my coworkers was hired on full time from a contract position. This got me a little bit worried about my future at my current company (explanation to follow). I was hired back in November 2014 as a sub-sub-contractor (I work for a company A, housed in Virginia, they contracted me to a company B in Washington, who contracted me to a company C where I do the actual programming). My initial contract was for 6 months, so in March 2015, I asked my manager (at C) what the status of my contract was. They decided to extend me until October 2015. Before I got this contract in November, I was on-the-bench, unpaid, for company A for 4 months while they were looking for a position for me (it's in my contract with A that while I'm on the bench, I cannot myself look for employment). The reason this worried me is because I am locked into a contract with Company A until October of 2016. With this in mind, I'd like to avoid the situation where I'm on the bench for 4 months and not able to pay certain bills again. There are about 4 months until my contract is up. Should I wait until it is closer to the contract end date before bringing up the conversation with my manager at company C? 

I'll give you the Shark Tank answer. If you believe in the startup and you are a founder/owner, commit. Most startups do fail, but one of the reasons is lack of commitment. What happens if you go from one day a week at the startup to seven? Can you get the product/service to market or to an investable stage quickly? What is the reward? Will the startup bring you millions or wages? If you can bring a $million product to market in three-six months of 7-day weeks, you should quit and crash on friends couches (or call mom & dad about your old room). If you still think part-time is better, it's hard to say. You said there is no legal conflict, so you need to think about perceptions. If you say it's personal and they find out it's business, that could be a problem of perception - they could feel lied to. If you are just "average" as you say, they should be fairly neutral towards you - less likely to feel "hurt" than if their best employee wanted to leave. If they like you personally, they may be more willing to help you start your own business. In that case being direct is best, even better if the company is small and young - they may admire the entrepreneur in you. 

Looking at your comments, it seems that he doesn't really care about if it makes you feel uncomfortable. If you haven't spoken with a higher-up about it (manager, HR, something) then this will continue. If you have and he continues, keep bothering them. If nothing changes, leave the company if it's really that big of a deal. UNORTHODOX: If you let them know every time it happens, and tell him to stop every time it happens, and neither does anything, make them feel uncomfortable. Whenever you see them, lick your lips really loudly, when they touch you, rub their arm hair or neck hair, never break eye contact, flare your nostrils and breathe only through your mouth. In my experience*, they either get the picture real quick and stop doing what they're doing, or they take it to the higher-ups. If they action on his complaints and not yours, leave. *Results may vary 

I am asking this question on behalf of my girlfriend. She recently applied for a job at Macy's (a department store). After about a week, they wanted to schedule an over-the-phone interview, before doing an in-person interview. So they scheduled it, and she was nervous but I told her it would be fine. It wasn't. When they called the first time, they asked to clarify on how to spell her name. She spent about 15 seconds not saying anything, and then hung up the phone. After about a minute, they called her back, and I told her to say that the line got disconnected, in an attempt to recover the interview. They answered and proceeded on to the interview. Then they asked (and I'm paraphrasing here) if she uses technology. Again, she got real quiet, was like that for about 15 seconds, and then hung up the phone. They did not call back at that point. We spent a couple of weeks training for the phone interview. I would call her from a random number at different points during the day, and ask some normal interview questions, and she was fine. It was only when it came to an interview that mattered that she wasn't able to do it. So my question is, how can I help her get over this social/over-the-phone anxiety that she's experiencing? 

This tells them to talk to their manager without you being in a position to judge them or lecture them. It is possible that their manager will know why the CEO stopped by. The manager might also contact the CEO or have the intern contact the CEO, depending on what they decide the next step should be. 

After a few days I would drop a quick note to your contact. Because of you bonus question( a vacation day almost immediately you have an excuse to contact the company and ask about a work/HR procedure.) 

Assuming that he ignores your announcement that you are no longer going to get his lunch, you might have to be passive-aggressive: 

It is the same as any other course I have taught. The instructor has to break the material into chunks and provide an opportunity to get feedback from the participants. This feedback lets the instructor know that the information is being received and understood. When you are able to see the class, and the class size is small, it is possible to get some feedback via visual cues. When you can't easily watch the eyes and body language of the students you have to allow the students to provide that feedback by other means: asking questions, completing exercises, answering questions. A training class, like any other meeting must have goals. When the class is completed what are the goals of the class designer, the instructor, the students; and how can the those goals be measured? If the instructor drones on for 20-30 minutes with zero feedback it is clear that the instructors goal was to plow though the material with no regard for making sure the student understood the material. It is unclear if that matched the goal of the course designer. And in the case of the students it may or may not have met their goals. A few months ago I was a participant in a series of training classes via a web connection. The instructor talked in one continuous sentence for the entire 30 minutes. They immediately ended the class with the phrase see everybody next week. They ignored all the questions that students had written via the interface. The slides weren't provided until several day later, and it was easy to see that they had just read the words on the slides. The next week it was clear that that was how the class was going to be run. The students got credit for being logged in during the class, and the instructor didn't even have to have any domain knowledge. Easiest class ever, but zero information retained. 

Try packaging your work and making it easier to review. Estimate the time it will take to review the items. If you have a lot of small independent items, package them into sets of code into logical chunks that can be reviewed within a specific period - like one hour. Schedule a meeting and send links to the repo items. Talk to the team and explain you are trying to clear the backlog through a series of short and targeted meetings. From the other side, you can put everything together into a growing, single review request. But this is sort of pushing in the direction you don't seem to want to go. Every time you complete a new unit of code, add it to this single request, and update the total time. It may be that people just aren't thinking about the backlog growth. If you manager sees a code review request and it says, "This is a code review request for item X committed on {x/x/x} | {21 days ago}, item y committed on {x/x/x} | {20 days ago}, item... It will take approximately 40 hours to review these 200 items", it will drive home the point. 

The problem is the word "day". Could it be that you were just a self employed Stock Trader? Or even just an Investor? Did you almost always zero out at the end of the day? Write down what you did as a trader, without the word day. If that is honest and looks good, what's the point of adding "day"? Being successful in your chosen career for several years belongs prominently on your resume, especially if it is your current job. Don't lie about anything, but don't unnecessarily label something with a label you (and possibly others) don't like. Many people don't know what day trading is, they only think it is something fishy. If someone asks, "Were you day trading?", you are already being considered (you made it to the interview). Just saying "yes" should be less of an issue by that time. 

Note that the last one is interesting. Yes, direct deposits can go into a savings account. Of course those savings accounts don't have a blank voided check. My sons have checking accounts but have never written a check, they use the debit card for everything. They have had multiple jobs and have had direct deposit with all of them. In some cases they just provided the numbers, in other cases they filled out the form themselves, or even did them on line. Providing the voided check also gives the employer a verification that they didn't typo the routing number. Modern systems will immediately look up the name of the institution when the routing number is entered. One company recently used the info entered on the HR system to verify the bank, and the name associated with the account. They are stuck using an old set of rules. 

Yes ask. This might be an opportunity for you to learn something about how you interviewed. You might learn about a weakness, or you may actually learn you have a strength. Remember they did decide to give you a position, even if the position isn't the one you wanted. They may have had too many people applying for the same position, or maybe this one opened up at the last minute. Either way they though you were too valuable to not find something for you. So yes, ask. Find a quiet time to discuss it. Keep it calm and look for learning opportunities in the discussion. Remember one of your goals, assuming you aren't doing this just for college credit, is to try and build this internship into a better internship next year, or eventually a full-time job. The info you get from this discussion may be very useful for getting the dream position next time. 

As others have said, apply to both. While as @IDrinkandKnowThings says you run a risk, on the other side you can emphasize in your cover you are applying not so much to the job, but to the company because you have such a strong desire to work there. Also consider other channels beyond the online application system. Do your research and see if this company works with recruiters. You can search old job postings by company name and see if they were posted by recruiters. The recruiting company will usually have an account manager for the company that understands the company needs and people. If you can impress this person, they can point you in the right direction or get your resume near the top of the stack for review. 

There is a gap you need to overcome before you ask. You compared your code to what he gave you and didn't detect the deltas. To your boss there must be clear differences. Study the coding style of other code in the repo and patterns may emerge. You will also become more familiar with the code base at the same time. 

Your role in the project is important. If you are a technical resource, it is not your job to "rescue the project". If you are the project manager, it is different. If they want you to do both...run? It sounds like you are on the technical side, since you talk about the technology stack. If so, I would look at this as almost a win-only case. If your skills are sound, and you are motivated, you should be able to do something with the technologies. To your advantage, the bar seems pretty low - failing slower is an improvement! As long as you have been clear about you strengths with the technology, you have set the expectation that there is some learning involved. At a minimum you should expect some time to improve your skills on your own, but you could also negotiate some training. Tell them you would like them to bring in an expert for one day to give you some 1-on-1. Accepting the position shows you are a team player. Discussing your concerns in the process and proposing risk mitigation shows you are a smart team player. If the project succeeds, you are part of a turn-around team and people will remember. If you are successful and "save" the project, the rewards are even greater. If the project continues to fail, and you are not adding to the problems, it will have a minimal negative effect on you. 

The cover letter/CV/resume shouldn't include the contact information for your references. They don't want their contact info posted all over the internet. If a company wants to contact your references they will ask for the list, their contact info and the relationship to you. That is the time you should provide these caveats regarding former and current positions and titles. In the hiring process many will submit resumes but only a few will have their references checked. This is due to the fact that most resumes never even trigger an interview. 

Sometimes you are the employee of a staffing company for that first six months. At the conclusion of the period one of three things will happen. They will hire you; they will send you back to the staffing company who will send you to another project; or you will be out of a job. The tough thing is to determine how likely one of those options has been predetermined. Sometimes the six month period is just used to get them over a rough patch. You are looked at as a temporary solution without any hope of getting hired. Others use it as way of paying back the hiring company. They get a cut of your pay for 6 months. I have avoided this situation but I am seeing a lot more of it. With the uncertain budget situation in the US many companies are willing to hire for 6 months, but are unable to forecast beyond that point.
