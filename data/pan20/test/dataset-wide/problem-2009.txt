I don't think you've identified what is important to your boss. Either 8:00 AM has some very important reason to it or he wants to make sure you're working a certain amount of time. Some people see being late as either not caring or a willingness to make a special effort. Or it's a way to keep you on your toes. Others just want you to get in your 40. The bigger problem is you have no open dialog with your boss. He comes in at 7:00, why don't you? You could end up saving a lot of time by avoiding rush hour. Either that or shift your hours later. Ask to discuss a workable solution. Mention the issues with traffic. If you come early, do you get to leave early? No one here has any insight into this situation or what your boss is thinking. You're going to have to be able to have an adult conversation. If this is causing him to think less of you, it could be a sign of a declining work relationship. He may resent this and feel like you're confronting him. I don't see what you have to lose. You are already having troubles with your boss. 

I think you need to dig deeper into your reasoning and figure-out how this benefits the client. Have your boss clarify that it is all right to delay applying updates. Maybe the clients understand this or the nature of their business is not quite so time sensitive. Make sure your boss understands the risks. Worse-case-scenario, client is expecting/desperately needs the fix. Are you suppose to tell them it is not going to happen because your boss is unavailable? If not, what lie does he suggest. Someone in the company should suffer the consequences and I don't think it should be you, but you'll be the bearer of bad news. 

Your company was just aquired and you think you can make demands to the new manager? Your position or possibly the entire department may be viewed as redundant and on the way out. As an engineer, you'd like to think your technical knowledge is enough, but most managers are going to favor those who make their job easier; not yours. Questioning their decisions too early could be a big mistake especially for the reasons you stated. You need to wait and see if this is going to become a habit. The next time you can suggest assigning the task to someone else. Don't make it sound like this work is beneath you or you're trying to get out of work. Be subtle about the benefits of your working on other types of tasks. In smaller firms, most employees have to wear many hats and do more of the mundane work. There are no captains on a leaky rowboat, everyone has to bail. 

This exercise will be a very good start for your negotiation. Be prepared for your evaluation. There should be some sort of meeting with your manager to discuss it. If it is a bad review, hopefully you were able to list the things you accomplished. Indicate you hoped your initial performance would lead to a higher raise than normal since you were willing to take the job at a rate so much lower than average. The tricky part is if you're giving yourself credit for things because no one ever told you you did them poorly. If the boss thinks you did poorly, ask why you weren't given any feedback at the time because you want to do well. Don't be afraid to look for other jobs. You don't want to be seen as a job hopper, but when you are able to get a significant increase in salary, no one should hold that against you. It's probably the best reason to leave (emphasis on significant.). 

You're too tired to spend extra time learning stuff. I'm sorry, you're 26 and probably don't have half of the life-stresses you're going to accumulate in the near future: marriage, children, cars, houses, illness, aging. You're in the prime of your life and you act like you don't have the energy. It's only going to get worse if you don't build up some stamina. Employers won't be interested in your excuses. Money isn't a problem. - There's just something to be said about someone's motivation when they at least want some money. Although greed can be an issue, many people are stable in their careers because they need the money. Employers like that and have contingencies if you win the lottery. You will always need to develop new skills for new technologies. Again, how are you going to develop new skills in the future if you can't do it now? Most jobs aren't going to let you go on sabbatical. Many offer training, but spending one week in some class isn't going to turn you into an expert. 

Just about the same things you would do when applying for any other job. The advantage you have, is they're familiar with the project. Do some research on these companies and send them your CV or apply for a specific opening. If you can mention something in the cover letter specific to meeting someone from their company, even better. Don't bash the marketing or lack of funding. You worked on an ambitious project with lofty goals. You're suppose to be excited about that and not dwell on the practicality or viability of the project. What did you learn? How did it make you better at your job? What was the nature of the work and how could it apply to help the next company? Many very good people have been a part of failed projects. Focus on the positive things just like any other smart candidate would. Edit: Non-compete It may be difficult to find out, but some of these people your company are in contact with may have agreements not to hire each other's employees. You may need to spend some time talking to these people about their situation and if their company sounds desirable, let them know how you feel without coming right out and asking for a job. 

This isn't uncommon, but it has to be managed. You have a lot of work to do if your management starts to complain that your people aren't working hard enough because they never work over-time. You'll know you're doing your job when you spot the employee that is volunteering too much over-time and you send him/her home with the threat of unplugging their computer ;) 

What's the problem? Are you getting negative feedback for not responding to important emails in a timely fashion? What are your supervisor's expectations? Does everyone assume you get email and IM on your phone as well? It just seems like if emailing/IM didn't work, they would use the mode of communication that does. Are you sure they see these issues as important as you do? Sounds like a pet-peeve. 

Testers and developers have different needs, so don't always think treating people the same is treating them equally. Maybe there is something more important to them instead of dual monitors and might cost less. It could be as simple as altering some of your processes that negatively affect them. The key is for someone to take the time to ask, listen and make an effort to improve their situation. Unfortunately, you waited until developers started leaving before you listened to them. Don't make the same mistake with testers. They may not leave, but stay with you and not make their best effort. 

Start by scheduling a time and place to ask you questions. Just because you're the mentor doesn't mean you have to be available whenever he feels like it. At this point, set 2-3 a day. Next, push back on his questions by asking what has he tried. You're trying to teach a process on how to go about finding solutions. Give him time, he's spent many years in educational systems where teachers wait a few seconds and if no one comes up with an answer, the teacher just gives it to them. It's an old habit to break. Make him take notes. Part of his training is to build his own "Help." This puts him on notice that you don't expect him to keep asking the same questions over and over. Encourage him to come up with the worst hacks ever. So what? You'll work with him on other solutions. Good teachers let students fail longer than normal, but make an effort not to discourage them. This is easier said than done which is why teaching is so difficult. 

Be a good programmer, stop repeating yourself and automate your build process. There will be push-back 

How do you think someone is going to review your project? They'll probably focus on code structure and not go through the app installation like a typical user (esp. if it is large) looking for flaws and limited functionality. In a cover letter, focus on the status of the project and the future work you plan on doing. This should put things into perspective. You could include other documents that outline how you plan on structuring the additions, so people can see how you plan as well as code. 

Make sure you can get people on LinkedIn to recommend you for the work you did in these part time jobs. This would go a lot further to help you get a new job than just putting it in a job listing. 

How will this affect your ability to manage the remainder of the team going forward? Do any of these people that choose to take her side, want to be the next assistant? Anyone asks for time off that is inappropriate, say no. If you let them, you're just as unethical as they are. Suggest she change her ways or you're going to use whatever disciplinary action is at your discretion. Stop using "this is an educational setting" as an excuse. I realize other industries may have it easier when it comes to disciplining people, but that doesn't mean it is impossible. They are still paid to do a job and should suffer the consequences when they don't. Go through the proper channels. Document the infractions. Do your job. You choose to take on the responsibility as the department head. The others may not like it, but this isn't just a popularity contest. You have a job to do, so stop rationalizing it and finding excuses not to.It's no different than someone who thinks they get to slack of their final days because they think there is nothing you can do about it. She's leaving and is obviously going to be replaceable.
