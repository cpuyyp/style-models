Often people in senior positions feel that they need a certain professional distance. It's likely not personal, they just don't want to start getting pally with everyone. Edit added: e.g. they want to be able to take business decisions without friendship getting in the way of those decisions. By "professional" in this context I do not necessarily mean "respectful", rather I mean, "operational", or "functional". The intention is not to show distance or superiority. Usually, it has nothing to do with showing anything. The idea is simply to maintain relationship distance. They just don't want to be your friend, probably not because of anything about you, but simply because of where they find themselves. Given that goal, the alternative (if they actually begun interacting with you), is to get to a point where they verbally reject you, which they don't want to do. So this choice (being aloof) is the least bad for them. 

I may have an unconventional answer, but my answer to you is HELP HIM. It's not your concern how he does his job. Or to complain about him. Your concern is how you do your job and how you help him to achieve his goals and help him to look good to his boss. That's your role. Not to tell him to be different. But to help him achieve his goals. That's what you are there for.It might not seem fair, but that's life. Some people just seem to have things too cushy. But if you try to change their cushy life you will get resistance and not make any friends. That's not progress, that's not getting ahead without hurting others, which is what you ideally should want to do - get ahead without hurting others. Just help him, set the envy aside and things will work out well for you. 

What this is telling you is that your manager does not trust you, your manager thinks you are inauthentic and thinks you are arrogant and/or have a higher regard for your own ability than you actually have. Relationships depend on trust to survive. Take note here your problem is not a technical problem. Your problem has very little to do with the quality of your code. What you have is a problem with the way you are relating to your colleagues and your manager. 

You cannot please all of the people all of the time. There will always be more demands, and that is a good thing. Just do the best you can, be as productive as possible while mitigating technical debt and relax about the outcome. High intention, low attachment. Also, get the balance right between obligation to your employer and obligation to your own health and well being. 

If by "ensure", you mean you have responsibility for the technical proficiency, then you are being asked to undertake that responsibility without the necessary authority to enable you to do that. If by "ensure", you mean you are just an adviser, then you should willingly accept the project and let go of the need for control. Document the errors and omissions and where you feel strongly, express that in the documentation. Get clarification on the extent of your responsibility. 

Be clear on what your issue with this is, I think you confuse profanity with abuse. My opinion is that that kind of language is offensive, not so much because of the profanity, but because it is low level abuse. The subtext is, "you're not important". "I can treat you like an animal". Some people find that kind of behavior funny. Well they can have their laugh or two, then I'd vote with my feet. I don't want to be around people who relate to me that way, why would I want to tolerate that? No way. My physical and emotional health are my number one priority. I would need extreme levels of pay to work with those kinds of people, and STILL I wouldn't be there long. Your skills are marketable. Even if they weren't, I would still advise you to look for another job. 

Sounds to me like you want the user to make more effort in figuring out their own solution, or at least coming to you once they have gathered enough info to assist you in triaging or resolving it. You'd like to train the user to go through this process first, to make the situation less frustrating for you, and presumably help them learn at the same time. The thing is, support does not work that way! If users spent the time gathering enough info to solve their own problems, most of the time, guess what? They would solve their own problems! Support requirement happens when a user wants to save their own time by asking someone who, in their minds hopefully, already knows the answer and can quickly and easily provide it. The whole value to them in having you as support is that they don't have to spend their own time researching the answer. That's the whole point of them asking you. The only question you have to answer, therefore, is do you accede to these requests, or not? If you bounce it back to them and give them work to do, it defeats the whole purpose of them asking you, or mitigates the value of it to them. Some further info gathering is reasonable and understandable but if the process becomes cumbersome or excessive, this will have the effect of them (1) seeking help elsewhere instead next time (2) complaining that getting support from you is too much trouble Providing support is a negotiation. They don't know what you need, so they provide incomplete and unclear information at the outset because it saves them time and gives you an opportunity to tell them what you need. If they go off hunting for information first, they might be wasting their time, from their perspective. People vary widely in the amount of effort they are willing to put into this first stage. You will not easily change people's behavior. It can help to have a simple standard process that gathers common information that is frequently required though, as a prerequisite for providing support, but this should be easy for your users to obtain and provide. 

Look for another job, and raise your suspicions with the relevant authorities immediately. Then let the cards fall where they may. You are complicit if you have strong suspicions of illegal activity and do nothing. 

Depends on the rules of the interview, some allow it, some don't. In particular, if it is a test it may be allowed. It's a good idea to check first! 

Well you can clearly still apply for interview. Whether or not the company considers 3 years to be a strict limit or not depends on the company. I'd be very surprised if it was that strict. HR departments quickly learn that if they have hard and fast rules in place for this, they end up tossing potentially excellent candidates. 

The best time to ask for a raise is always when you have a higher offer in hand. So in particular, if you want a raise, the number one thing you should be doing is interviewing elsewhere. 

What should she do? Answer is first and foremost LOOK FOR A NEW JOB. This employer has all the signs of about to fail, in which case she might be owed back pay that is difficult if not impossible to collect. What she should do second is assess the risk on an ongoing basis. Eg. if her weekly salary is $1000 for example, and she thinks that she's only 75% likely to get paid next time, she needs to ask herself whether she's willing to remain in the job being paid only $750, or whether her time might be better spent doing something else. Could she file for unemployment successfully if paychecks bounce repeatedly? Seems like constructive dismissal to me. 

It's non-negotiable until you decline it due to it's insufficiency. Then lo and behold, you may well find it becomes negotiable again (i.e. offered to you at a higher level). Basically you have two reasonable options depending on how much you value the offer. 1) Accept with enthusiasm 2) Decline, citing reason it is inadequate To try to negotiate when they've said it's not negotiable shows you're either not good at listening or not good at responding to their needs. They've essentially indicated they want you to make one of the two choices listed above. I recommend you do that. If you feel that they will pay you more, and you feel like it's worth the risk, then by all means decline. There's always another day, declining doesn't mean you can never work for that company again. There may be another opportunity down the road. Note: The company is using a technique similar to "Boulwarism", which though not illegal in this way, has been discredited by authorities as unfair (at least in union negotiations). 

Yes. Very. One of the big challenges of software engineering (and engineering generally) is determining reasonable time estimates for work requests. Working closely with stakeholders to agree on reasonable expectations. 

If you are a contractor, it is sensible to always operate on the assumption that your contract ends at its end date or even sooner. You should have this assumption regardless of what anyone tells you at the company. I mean, what are they going to say? "You're job isn't secure"? No, they won't tell you that! So... there is really little to be gained by quizzing management on this. You job is always "secure" (or budget is forthcoming). Until ... suddenly ... it isn't. That means you should practically always be looking for a job, especially as a contractor. Contractors are usually the first to be let go, and not infrequently before the promised (but not contractual) end date. That doesn't mean that you should wave your job search in their face though. Just keep your options sensibly open. 

Hard to know how to answer this question definitively because it is based on risk/reward which will be vastly different between cultures, employment markets, individual circumstances and jurisdictions - e.g. no point insisting on the 9k if the job is essential to you at 90k, you'd be throwing out the baby with the bath water. As always your negotiating position would be strengthened by having other options, though, so if you are inclined to argue for the 9k, start looking for another job. 

You essentially have three viable choices 1) Leave. This is probably your best option. There is not a level of pay that is really worth ongoing low level psychological harm. It makes sense to get your resume out there and have options anyway, most likely. 2) Minimize your contact with the bully, keep your head down. Stay out of his way. Do your best job. 3) Give John an ultimatum - say that Jack has to either change his behavior, leave, or you will have to leave. You might want to prepare option (1) above if you are planning this course of action.
