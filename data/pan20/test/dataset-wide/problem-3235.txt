Typical decisive battles in Roman times involve 4+ legions - around 20,000 men + auxiliaries giving a total of about 30,000 men, on the Roman side only. Battles in even the late middle ages and early modern age typically involve 30,000 men in total. Even Alexander the Great mustered over 40,000 men in tiny Greece with an estimated population of 3,000,000 whereas mighty France with an estimated population of 13,000,000 in the years before the black plague could only barely match that number at Crecy. Given the increase in population over 1,500 years later, why did the early modern world not see more battles of ancient classical scale? 

The Thirteen Colonies had an incredibly rocky start, running out of food and surrounded by Indian tribes which were not pacified until much later. Yet 200 years later, the population in the colonies eclipses many if not every other European colonial settlement in the Americas, including - New Granada, New Spain, Rio de la Plata, New France and Louisiana. For example, 1770 Boston was larger and more economically active than Montreal, New Orleans, Veracruz, Havana, Buenos Aires or Cartagena, and yet taking just Boston would not allow one to dominate the entire area as opposed to the other cities in which the loss thereof is usually enough for you to claim the entire colony on the peace table. So how and why were the 13 colonies so successful? 

My favorite ex-seminarian says that he was taught that early Christians were supposed to destroy the power of idols (note the assumption that they had power) by breaking off the nose, genitals, or hands, or any larger destruction. At a certain stage, any statue might be an idol to them. It may be lack of good excavation that many statues were dug up without a good search for the small bits. His nose might have broken off from the weight of earth on it, and been lying right there, but no one looked for it. 

Wheat has often been eaten boiled whole or cracked, whether called bulgar or frumenty/frumentee. Frumenty was a common street-peddlar food in Western Europe up into the 1800s. (Hale, Horizon History of Eating and Drinking) I'm used to eating mochi rice as boiled or baked dumplings or cakes. There's rice noodles, too, all very traditional. So it's not really divided the way you think it is. You just have a limited food experience. The real difference here is that wheat can develop gluten protein in a way most grains can't. This gluten allows bread to be raised and develop its breadlike texture. Most other grains can only be made into flatbreads. As for cornbread, I checked Homemade Bread by the Food Editors of Farm Journal and, except for Anadama Batter Bread, all corn bread is made with wheat flour flavored with corn meal. Rye bread is rye-flavored wheat bread &c. Ah, The American Woman's Cookbook 1943 gives us a Southern Cornbread that relies on stiffly beaten egg white to make it less than leaden. Ditto the Southern Spoon Bread. Not so the johnnycake, and you know the rhyme about that. EDIT: Sorry, guess this is a New England thing. "Pea soup and johnnycake Make a Frenchman's belly ache." I seem to have inherited my Francophone grandmama's digestion and don't like either. But the rhyme was saying neither was delicate food. 

This is unfortunately the only source I could find which describes COMECON's imperialist tendencies in great detail. The article was written in Albania in 1981, so one should take it with a grain of salt as Albania was not in the Soviet camp but the Chinese, and it was not so long ago that China and the USSR experienced a massive deterioration of relations. The article also does not reference many sources but I think that Albania, being aligned to the Communists, would have a better perspective of reality east of the Iron Curtain than anyone in the west. I have extracted select statements of interest below. The article states that the intention originally was probably to control the satellite states but over time evolved into corruption on a state scale. For example, as was the case in Czechoslovakia and Hungary: 

I'm talking about the formational fighting show in this video: $URL$ Where did the show's creators get the source material? If so, what was it called, when did this style of fighting start and was it effective? 

This site implies that the redcoat was given a higher allowance of live ball shot than other nation's soldiers, however the source is not stated. An Osprey book confirms the figures for the British army though, although there is no information provided for the state of the other armies. 

Ann Hyland wrote two books on The Warhorse with different subtitles re the time periods covered: the first ancient and medieval, the second Renaissance and modern. She also wrote Equus on horses and mules in the Roman realms. First, wash out any images of knights on Shires and other big draft horses. Draft horses are for draft, are weak in the back for carrying, have gallumphing gaits, and only developed in the later 1700s, but mostly in the 1800s. Shires get their height from Thoroughbred blood. (Silver, Horses of the World) Thoroughbreds were developed from the 1600s forward as cavalry remounts (Osmer, On Horses), and one of the qualities desired was speed. So they developed as racehorses. They are the fastest breed. Now, you can erase all this modern stuff because medievals didn't know about it. While Svinhufnud did translate an Anglo-Saxon horse care text, we can see from that the medievals were still largely basing choices in riding horses on Xenophon, On Cavalry, c.350 BC. (You can get a translation at Project Gutenberg or the Perseus Project.) What makes a good horse for the job had not changed. A good-sized warhorse was 15hh, and a hand is 4", measured to the withers, the pointy bit behind the neck. Hyland bases a lot of her sizing on horseshoe sizes, and surviving saddletrees. Smaller was common. The look of the horse was like a heavy hunter. Roman noses were the norm. Look at statuary. The Frisians of today preserve much of the look, and so were used in the movie Ladyhawke. A Frisian/Saddlebred cross is possibly closer, and a completely droolworthy beast. Warhorses were called destriers/dextriarii because they went on a dexter lead (our left lead), according to S. A. Bolich. This put the support in the right place for crashing your lance into someone else. On the right lead, the horse is far more likely to fall back. So they took special training. It's controversial whether they had haute ecole training (like the Lippizzaners in Vienna), if this would be any use in battle, but a horse fighting footsoldiers under saddle is reported as far back as the Graeco-Persian Wars. The Athenians had a special bounty out on Mardonios's warhorse because it was such a terror. You can also see haute ecole poses in the Elgin Marbles. Bolich says it could work, and it would seem to be required to take on a phalanx. As to travel: depends on breed, condition, supplies, and roads. Not to mention climate, weather, and necessity. Some Mongol horses probably travelled from Mongolia to Europe. I would need my notes at home to quote weights of armour for the destrier. 

How many of them fought on in the Free French Forces and how many of them simply repatriated back to France? 

In the late middle ages, every knight or even his retainers and squires were armed with a spear or a lance. When heavy cavalry gave way to pike squares, we still see the lance still in use among the demi-lancers. Somewhere along the way though, they completely disappeared, surviving only in the Polish army and appropriately enough to be resurrected by them in the 18th century when the effectiveness of the Polish cavalry was shown. Since then, the lance stayed with cavalry until they became mechanized. A possible culprit is the Reiter employing the caracole which showed tactical supremacy over the lancer in many battles such as Coutras but that doesn't explain why they suddenly became resurgent again in the 18/19th century. What caused the lance's short disappearance and why? If it indeed was firearms and caracolle tactics, then what made them become popular again later on? 

Whilst most of China is quite culturally and ethnically diverse, there are significant areas especially on the coast and river plains which are mostly Han Chinese. These provinces are also united by a strong central government for much of their history, and did not spend any significant amount of time divided since the start of the Song Dynasty. Yet, they remained linguistically divided for centuries until the Communist Party declared that everyone should speak Putonghua/Guoyu/Mandarin, and even then local dialects are still very popular in the south. As an example, my family emigrated from China in the 1930s and can only speak a dialect known as Hakka, whilst my colleagues in Guangzhou are more comfortable with Cantonese than Mandarin. I can understand why different ethnic groups have different dialects, but why is their a difference in the Han Chinese themselves? Presumably the coastal and river cities would be heavily involved in commerce with each other, necessitating a common language? Yet Guangzhou and Beijing speak differently. Why? 

Jules-Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly, in Du Dandysme et de Georges Brummel (The Anatomy of Dandyism, 1845) claims that French dandies of his day used to use a piece of broken glass to shave down the fabric of their coats until they were almost sheer, and might break through. If you want to believe him. I don't consider him very reliable, especially since a lined jacket isn't going to work like this. 

You might want to find a copy of the 1990 translation of Hans Delbrück, The History of the Art of War - v.II IIRC, if not III. He discusses the size of Viking forces beseiging Paris, and how small they must have been to have been bought off at the price they were. What you must remember is that communications didn't exist, other than someone on a horse getting away. There was no swift way to summon a bunch of feudal warriors together, then ride out there, only to find the Norse set sail hours before. They didn't hang around. Catching them was almighty difficult. Delbrück argues that one reason for the change to feudalism was to have a quicker local response to raiders. The entire England couldn't raise a force to fight them because they could not predict where they would strike, and it would take weeks to march men of Kent up to Yorkshire. 

First, to make it clear, there was a single bank in USSR which worked with personal accounts: Гострудсберкассы СССР (i.e. state workers' savings "Kassen" of USSR - the word "bank" was apparently missing), which in 1987 was renamed to Сбербанк СССР (i.e. savings bank of USSR). 

Actually no one knows what '666' stands for. There is no evidence that it has some connection to Roman numeral, but not, say, Greek (or Jewish) numeral. Thus there are dozens of guesses, but no single answer. Some examples to produce '666' are: 

Well, they didn't refuse to provide any help except "foot on the ground". And the reasons they had are obvious if we remember what actually happened. One may argue that the level of support came out to be unsufficient etc. Well, errare humanum est. Probably they hoped too long that Taraki would sort it out himself. After all, as we know, Andropov and Ustinov insisted on direct intervention in December 1979. Though even then it was split decision. There's also a widespread opinion that Brezhnev finally agreed on the military operation because of personal matters (he considered Taraki a good friend and was very upset after his murder, so he particularly disliked the idea to cooperate with Amin anymore). 

One thing to notice about ancient clothing is its general drapiness, like today's saris in India. There isn't much place for stiffened fabrics. (Boucher's 20,000 Years of Fashion covers early costume well) In Indo-European languages territory, the fabrics were woolens (don't starch), linen (can starch but no evidence of it), and cotton in the eastern range (ditto). When linen was stiffened for Egyptian or Grecian armour, the layers were gummed, not starched. We do know that starch was used to stiffen food, like sauces, as we still use cornstarch today. (* The Horizon Cookbook and Illustrated History of Eating and Drinking Through the Ages * which has good recipes) That the roots for words for starch in different languages go back to Proto-Indo-European doesn't mean the PIE had starch, or even that Classical peoples starched their clothes. I believe if you check you will find the roots for computer and ordinateur go back to PIE, too. :D The earliest I can think of starch moving from the kitchen to the wardrobe is the Middle Ages for starching veils and wimples. 

Knowledge of Greek was rare until the Renaissance. Scholars fleeing the fall of Constantinople brought to Italy their knowledge of Classical Greek, a good bit different from the popular Greek. In fact, through most of the Middle Ages, anyone knowing Greek was assumed to be Irish, and one of their better scholars at that. The habit of making younger sons priests to hold the bishoprics or lesser benefices a noble family controlled often meant churchmen had little more learning than their secular relatives. Priests and monks with no real knowledge of Latin were not uncommon, doing their offices and prayers by rote. 

I know of the famous Percentages Agreement between Stalin and Churchill. As is commonly known, Stalin reneged on his promise in regards to Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania which eliminated all British influence by 1950, but at the same time kept his promise on Greece and Yugoslavia. My question is, was Stalin intending to renege his promise on Greece and Turkey as well, but was thwarted? Was there a Soviet conspiracy to start/further support communist insurgencies in these countries, or did Stalin keep his sphere of influence? 

The purpose of the Cruiser was to roam the high seas, picking off merchant vessels, troopships or stragglers of a group. So then why were heavy and light cruisers often attached to Battleship or Carrier groups, and how was their purpose different to the attached Destroyers? 

Modern media seems to portray Joan of Arc as a very attractive girl. I don't quite buy this interpretation of her as it would also suggest plenty of suitors and could be counter productive in a camp full of men frustrated at the state of their country. So was Joan of Arc really as attractive as modern media suggests, or was she just a plain peasant girl who managed to uplift a country? 

What period? What place? A soldier for whom? Attacked by whom? Going where? If this guy is a Gaul ambushed by political enemies of his family in the time of Julius Caesar, near his home, it's a different story than a Legionnaire in North Africa during the Punic War. Starting w/road regs differ. First, there were different classes of roads. The ones you think of, made all of stone, last for thousands of years, are primary military roads. They existed to marcih the Legions on. In many places, there simply wasn't one, and the local road was improved dirt. Traffic on the big roads was limited, to prevent wear and tear. Cartwheels are the worst, so only occassional light buggies or official wagons got the go. Otherwise, everyone was walking or riding on an animal. Because of this, outside of cities, except for short hauls, merchandise moved on sumpter beasts, not wagons. So your caravan is a good choice: merchants and guards on horses leading pack mules or pack horses. Your character might ask permission to tag along. The chief merchant might okay this if he doesn't look dodgy. Thing is, most horses can't carry two riders: they aren't up to the strain. There would have to be a horse free for him He might volunteer to join the guard in exchange for food & a mount until they get to X.
