Well, from your description, you want the people who are not in the villages or out in the open to be protected. You just need to place strategic shelters and give everyone who needs to go outside a device that can ping the nearest shelter and show a direction to it (or the device could just come pre-installed with the locations). Of course, since you're talking about suits or dome like structures that can shield from extreme heats, I'm assuming this is a high-tech era. Since people will have a few hours advance notice of the danger, you don't even need that many shelters around. It would be easy to even walk to the nearest shelter (in an hour or so). A maximum of two hours of walking between shelters would ensure that you can get to the nearest one in one hour or less. 

Humanity has discovered the cure. The cure to what, you say? Why, the cure to everything known of course. Death is no longer part of a human life and there is no "life cycle" anymore. The keepers see that humans have advance far too much and they know that they will be an uncontrollable pest upon the universe or worse, wipe themselves and all life on Earth. So they decide to take action. They make a genetically engineered virus (if they can) or do it in a fantastical / magical way and release it into the air. All of humanity becomes sick in a matter of days and they die off. This way, you can also keep people alive that matter to the story by giving them immunity to the virus. You could also say that, since humans are no longer dying, the gatekeepers went mad with nothing to be done around them. Maybe the gatekeepers were dependent on "the last breath of a human" to keep living, so they had to do something to restart humanity but not necessarily wipe them off. Alternatively, any modification you make on these reasons or methods, or a combination of them, is also applicable. 

Self-sufficiency, the key to Anarchy The system you describe is a kind of Anarchy, and Anarchy comes with a lot of problems in an advanced society - that is why we see no successful Anarchies around. The main problem with Anarchy is that modern/advanced societies depend completely on: 

The long game: Nudging other people closer to giving up their soul If few are willing to give up their soul, then an indirect approach might be useful. The devils can recognize that those who actually do give up their soul do so under certain circumstances (despair, to save loved ones, etc.). If so, then they need to create those circumstances. So the demons have two kinds of 'customers'. The first type is one real mark, the ones that with enough manipulation can be made to willingly give up their souls. These may be ones who have contacted the demons as the second category in the past, or totally unknowing victims. The important point is that the demons are in for the long game with these people. They follow them through their entire lives just to create that particular setup where they will have no way out but to call them and offer all they have. The second type is the bulk of their customers. These people gain minor favors in exchange for doing things that push one of the real marks towards their final destination. Typically they will be entirely unaware of the real consequences of their actions and all of them might not appear to be overtly evil (although that depends on what the particular endgame is). It might be things like delivering a letter, closing their store early, convincing their friend to try a new drug, rescuing someone from a peril or pretty much anything. This can be nested to any level. Some devils might be setting up organizations, cults, drug cartels, gangs, insiders in governments etc through pawns and favors which can then be used to favor the long-games of the real marks of other devils. All of it ends with the same thing, people giving up their souls, but the majority of the effort is on the 'enabler structure' rather than the real victims. 

You just need to remove the motivation for people to move away from the populated areas and into the unpopulated areas. Why do people move? Because there's something there that's better (or more available) than what's here. In the historic real world's migrations, "something" was often farmland or less often other natural resources (mineral deposits, furs, timber, hunting grounds). In other cases, "something" was less-oppressive neighbors, culture, or government (for many subjective definitions of "oppressive"). In more recent times (but at least as far back as the black death), sometimes the "something" is jobs, either quality or quantity. So, to keep people from expanding into the unpopulated areas, you just have to make sure that the best place to move to was always a different already-populated area. Magic reduces the value of remote natural resources. If your farmers can magically prevent bad weather, pests, and soil exhaustion, they won't need to expand as far to feed the population. Same thing with minerals. Mining gold hundreds of miles from home is stupid when the alchemist up the street can make it from lead. Without the lure of remote resources, there's not much reason for people fleeing (what they see as) oppression to settle new towns. Much safer to move to one of the established-but-less-oppressive countries. Anyone fleeing the Empire will go to the Federation. Anywhere else, they'll be too few and too isolated to defend themselves. Fear of outsiders keeps most of the Kingdom's population inside its borders, much like cultural family bonds for the Nation's population. Jobs is the easiest. New employers set up where there's already a labor pool and infrastructure. I.e., in existing towns and cities. We see this in the modern real world, even with huge tax and real estate price disincentives. Just for completeness, high demand for labor in the cities (and/or widespread welfare) will keep people from turning to subsistence farming, which might otherwise drive a few away. Bonus reasons: 

Human genetic material when transplanted into an eggcell becomes a human. At least according to us - humans are sentient. Thus, if we start with human genomes, we just need to modify them enough that they are unable to breed with normal humans. There are multiple ways to do this but one way would be to split one or more of our chromosomes into several smaller chromosomes. This would make the modified lifeforms basically identical to humans, but when a sperm and an egg meet they would not be able to match their chromosomes correctly and there would be no viable offspring with normal humans. Over time (hundreds of thousands of years), or with exrtra induced mutations or additional deliberate changes, the new species would diverge from normal humans. All of this is probably doable with current gene-editing technologies together with current cloning technology, at least if neither ethics nor budget is a problem. 

Artifacts are not just things to be owned by anyone. Artifacts are filled with magic and certain artifacts, the ones that are really powerful, have their own will and they have conditions for ownership. Some might just prefer their owner to be murdered before they allow themselves to be taken, some might not want their owner's murderer to own them and some might just even disappear along with their owner. The merchant has to be willing to part with the artifact. This particular artifact won't interact with anyone who means harm to their owner and will only change ownership if its owner wants to give it up. This might be interpreted as "I could just coerce him to give it up." but that won't work, because the artifact will know that you meant its owner harm and it won't cooperate with you and will even go so far as to destroy itself if you ever try to use it. It might even want revenge and call the second strongest mage in the world, in a manner similar to The One Ring in Lord of the Rings, and that might just mean it becomes the tipping point between you and the second strongest. You wouldn't want those possibilities to become reality, even if they're really improbable, so you decide not to harm him in any way but to either convince him or pay him some way. 

It seemed like a good idea at the time. Now, it's too expensive to leave. Long ago (last year or generations ago), one or more wealthy entities (individuals, companies, governments, universities, cults, etc) believed it was worth the investment to move a few (tens/thousands/millions of) colonists to Mars. Then the situation changed. The backers, the colonists, or their descendants had second thoughts. Mars sucks. However, they're trapped by the same economics that made it hard to get there in the first place. The backers aren't going to pay for a return trip, and the colonists lack the wealth/industry/resources needed to make interplanetary trips themselves. So, the Mars colony continues to exist (and even expand) because there's nowhere else for the Martians to go. If your timeline allows it, you could have millions of Martians descended from a tiny group of initial colonists. So, now we only need a plausible reason to get a few people to Mars: 

It's the year 2068, humanity has managed to get a space elevator working about twenty years ago. Now, they need more metals and rare materials which are found in asteroids. Ships with specialized equipment bring asteroids towards Earth and set them in a very specific orbit, which passes close by the space elevator but does not collide with any other asteroids. Miners work on these asteroids and they get to work and deliver materials using the space elevator. A gigantic construction is underway to complete a self sustaining refinery so that asteroids can be mined and processed in place instead of having them brought to Earth. 

The shelters will not be as strong as the village enclosures of course, but the same goes for a suit. Though, these could even be holes in the ground, not really needing actual dome like structures as in the case of villages or expensive materials as in the case of a suit. 

This translates to 5,800 people sustained by hunting and gathering. This population will be reached by the above growth in about 9 generations or about 225 years. At this point population growth will stagnate unless they start farming the land. If about 20% is farmable, they could increase the carrying capacity to about 23,000 people. This would be reached in just 3-4 generations or 100 years after begining to farm the land in full. If they also invent irrigation, they could both increase the yeilds and increase the farmable area. Lets say they irrigate 30% of the land. This allows 160,000 people. This amount will be reached in 5-6 generations or 150 years. Given that there are probably plateus between each stage before new inventions and cultural changes occur, you could add 250 years between each stage. This would make the population cap out at ~160,000 after a little less than 1000 years. Keep in mind that the devastating effect of wars and the like will increase with farming technology, destroying 100 km2 of irrigated farmland will cause 10,000 people to starve the coming year.
