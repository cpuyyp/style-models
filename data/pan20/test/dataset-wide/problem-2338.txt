tl;dr I don't think you need spent big money on a new jacket just to go skiing if you have a serviceable soft shell. 

With a dash of common sense, and a modicum of skill I'd say packs are safe on a chairlift. One winter I skied over 100 days at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. I wore a pack the vast majority of those days. I never once felt that any of my packs at any time were decreasing my safety or the safety of others on the lift, tram, or gondola. According to Outside Magazine (emphasis mine): 

Many years ago I read that buffalo hunters would drink the liquid out of buffalo's eyes to gross out the greenhorns and tenderfeet (people new to the West). Attached to this anecdote was a claim that all ocular fluid is potable water. Is this true? While I don't think the source specifically stated this I believe they were talking about the Aqueous humour in apparently healthy mammals. That is the subset of animals that I'm most interested in but I'd also be interested in learning if this is generally applicable to any animal with big enough eyes. 

Another option is full blown disabled life jackets. These are likely to be the safest option out there. Two of the models shown in the link above don't seem all that practical since they look like a life ring with seat cushions sewn on. The other model looks like an over built version of the standard type 2 life jacket, which confirms that the first option I gave above is likely a good choice. 

While this may occasionally happen, the truth is bull snakes don't really affect rattle snake population apart from competition for the same food: 

Original answer This heavily depends on context and exactly what you mean by "either loop of the harness." First things first. The only loops that are load bearing on a standard climbing seat harness are located in the crotch area. These are known as the tie in points. Any other loop on the harness is intended to hold gear and isn't strong enough to hold your weight. Assuming you're talking about load bearing attachment points on the harness carabiners are only safe from cross loading in one very specific scenario. The carabiners need to constantly loaded so they maintain the appropriate orientation at all times and don't allow the rope/carabiner to move/rotate. The only way to really ensure this is to be climbing in a firm (constant tension on the rope) top rope situation. This is why the climbing towers you see at fairs with automatic belays are safe (among other reasons) even though they're using carabiners. These situations also benefit from the improved speed you mentioned. Constant tension on the carabiner is also why people aren't really worried about cross loading carabiners mid-rappel. In any other climbing situation/scenario the modest additional speed gain and significantly decreased safety margin aren't justified. I've climbed with many different people both outside and in gyms. Unless you have a group of people working a single short easy top roped climb the climbing time is going to be much greater than the tying in time. It simply doesn't take much time to tie and untie a knot. Occasionally I've taken many falls on a climb and had to untie a rock hard figure 8 knot when my forearms and fingers are pumped. Even then the entire amount of time to untie was less than 5 minutes, and the time it takes to tie a figure 8 should be less than 2 minutes including dressing the knot. You shouldn't feel so pressured to avoid an worst case scenario of 7 minutes of work that you're willing to risk a ground fall from height. 

Of course the Achilles heel of this device is the sun's height varies increasingly as you move away from the equator. The proper name for this pattern is an analemma. 

If I wanted to use fire to cut down a tree how would I accomplish this safely? Clearly if I build a big bonfire at the base of the tree it will burn down and possibly cause a forest fire. 

Keep in mind improvised arrow cutting solutions do not have many of the safety features of a commercial product. Use these at your own risk. Misuse or carelessness could cause serious injury to yourself or your equipment. 

It might be useful for you to reframe your objective mentally a bit. The goal isn't really to make sure the boat doesn't sink, so much as it is to make sure too much water doesn't get in the boat. By packing your boat with floats/gear/etc. you are preventing that volume of water from entering your boat. This is the real reason why someone would pack a canoe full of float bags. They aren't worried about the canoe sinking to the bottom of the river (generally speaking). They're worried about the canoe taking on so much water that it is harder to control (because of the excess weight). The amount of flotation to add to your canoe really depends on your perceived risk of taking on water, and the consequences if you do take on water. If the risks are low and consequences minor then just make sure your canoe won't sink to the bottom. If the risks are high and the consequences severe then fill every bit of space you can to deny it to incoming water (turn your canoe into a kayak). If you are somewhere in the middle of those two extremes then strike the balance that suits you. 

Based on the Q&A portion of the site I linked to above it appears as if the auto-locking low tech race bindings can't be used in the "unlocked" mode. Since I don't have a set of these bindings I can't attest to the veracity of this claim. It should be noted that this might be in violation of race rules, and these bindings are designed to allow lateral release with the toe locked per the link above. The relevant quotes are: 

Based on your edit that adds additional context your plan seems reasonable. In addition to the carabiners ShemSeger recommends you might consider a captive eye carabiner (any rated biner is fine. I'm just using these DMM biners as an example). These are often used in more industrial settings so they're often found in steel. Alternatively you can get a DMM Belay Master 2 carabiner. These are designed to ensure the biner is locked properly and prevent crossloading Finally, I agree with StrongBad that you should use the belay loop not the tie in points. 

In practice (my experience so YMMV) this means that my split-fins/flexible fins let me go slow to medium speed with less energy, and my stiff fins let me go slow to fast speeds albeit with a bit more effort on the low end. Personally I like having the ability to push hard/fast if I need to so I always end up using my stiff fins and keep my split/long fins for loaners/backups. The design that I prefer is similar to the one below: 

The prime benefit with a more flexible fin is you get greater efficiency vs a bare foot for a minimal cost in increased resistance when kicking. I've found that to be generally true with split-fins as well because the split makes the "scoop" of the fin more flexible. I've never swam with the really long free-diving and/or monofins but their length/size means they can't be very stiff. Stiff fins really shine when you care more about power/speed than reduced resistance. The fins that I typically use are stiffer fins, and I like them because I can kick softly to go slow, and I can kick hard/quickly to go fast. With more flexible fins I almost always reach a point where kicking harder doesn't actually make me go faster. Really short fins are nice when you just want a boost when kicking, but don't want to deal with the pain of walking with duck feet. A good use case for this is boogie/body boarding because you spend a decent amount of time in shallower water where it is more comfortable to walk.
