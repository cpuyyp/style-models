No. It is not a connected space. We can in fact describe the connected components of this space quite easily. Let $\simeq$ be the equivalence relation on $C$ where $f\simeq g$ iff $f-g$ has compact support. I claim that the equivalence classes of $\simeq$ are precisely the components. Incidentally, the equivalence classes of $\simeq$ are the path components and quasi-components as well. If $f-g$ has compact support, then let $L:[0,1]\rightarrow C$ be the mapping where $L(t)=g\cdot t+f\cdot(1-t)$ whenever $t\in[0,1]$. Then clearly $L$ is a path from $f$ to $g$. Now assume that $f\not\simeq g$. Then $f-g$ does not have compact support. Therefore, without loss of generality, assume that there are arbitrarily large positive real numbers $x$ such that $(f-g)(x)\neq 0$. Then there is some increasing sequence $(x_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ of real numbers with $x_{n}\rightarrow\infty$ where $(f-g)(x_{n})\neq 0$ for all $n$. Therefore let $\equiv$ be the equivalence relation on $C$ where $h_{1}\equiv h_{2}$ if and only if $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{(h_{1}-h_{2})(x_{n})}{(f-g)(x_{n})}\rightarrow 0.$$ Clearly $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation. On the other hand, the equivalence relation $\equiv$ partitions $C$ into open sets. Suppose that $U$ is an equivalence class in $C$ and $h\in U$. Then let $u$ be a continuous function with $u(x_{n})=\frac{1}{n}\cdot|(f-g)(x_{n})|$. Then if $|(k-h)(x)|<u(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, then $$|\frac{(k-h)(x_{n})}{(f-g)(x_{n})}|\leq|\frac{u(x_{n})}{(f-g)(x_{n})}|=\frac{1}{n}\cdot|\frac{(f-g)(x_{n})}{(f-g)(x_{n})}|=\frac{1}{n}$$, so $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{(k-h)(x_{n})}{(f-g)(x_{n})}\rightarrow 0.$$ Therefore $k\equiv h$, so $k\in U$ as well. Therefore $U$ is an open set. However, we have $f\not\equiv g$. Therefore $f$ and $g$ belong to different quasi-components, so $f$ and $g$ belong to different components. Therefore $f,g$ belong to the same component if and only if $f\simeq g$. This proof is the same proof as the proof of the fact that two sequences in the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ are in the same component if and only if they agree except for possibly finitely many coordinates. 

Let me answer as to how well the connected subspaces of a space determine the topology. I claim that for a large class of spaces, the collection of all connected subsets of the space determines the topology on $X$. However, the functions between nice connected spaces that map connected sets to connected sets are generally not continuous. The following lemma states that the closure of a connected subspace of a regular space $X$ is determined by the collection of all connected subspaces of $X$. In particular, the closed connected subspaces of a regular space $X$ are determined by the collection of all the connected subspaces of $X$. $\mathbf{Lemma}$ Suppose that $X$ is a regular space and $A\subseteq X$ is a connected subset. Then $\{a\}\cup A$ is connected if and only if $a\in\overline{A}$. Furthermore, if $A\subseteq B\subseteq X$, then $B\subseteq\overline{A}$ if and only if whenever $A\subseteq C\subseteq B$ then $\overline{C}$ is connected. The proof of the above lemma is straightforward. We shall say that a point $x$ is a connected space $X$ is a nbd-cut-point if there is some open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that whenever $V$ is an open set with $x\in V\subseteq U$, then $X\setminus V$ is not connected. Then it is easy to show that a connected space $X$ has no nbd-cut-points if and only if every closed subspace of $X$ is the intersection of connected closed subspaces of $X$. I should also mention that I made up the notion of a nbd-cut-point in order to answer this question, but the notion of a nbd-cut-point is closely related to the notion of a cut-point since every cut point is a nbd-cut-point. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ Suppose that $X,Y$ are connected regular spaces with no nbd-cut points. If there is a bijection $f:X\rightarrow Y$ so that if $C\subseteq X$ then $C$ is connected if and only if $f[C]$ is connected, then $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic. However, I must mention that even for connected regular spaces with no nbd-cut-points, there are non-continuous maps where the image of a connected space is connected. For example, define an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$ where $x\simeq y$ iff $x-y\in\mathbb{Q}$. Then there is a surjective function $f:\mathbb{R}/\simeq\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ since $|\mathbb{R}/\simeq|=|\mathbb{R}^{2}|$. Define a mapping $g:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by letting $g(x,y)=f([x])$ and define $h:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$ by letting $h(x)=f([x])$. Then $h[U]=\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for each nonempty open set $U$. I claim that $g$ maps connected subsets to connected subsets. Let $\pi_{1},\pi_{2}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the projection maps where $\pi_{1}(x,y)=x,\pi_{2}(x,y)=y$. Suppose that $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is connected. Then $\pi_{1}[C]$ is also connected, so $\pi_{1}[C]$ is either a singleton or an interval. If $\pi_{1}[C]$ is a singleton, then $g[C]$ is a singleton in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. However, if $\pi_{1}[C]$ is an interval, then $g[C]=\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In either case, the function $g$ maps connected sets to connected sets, but the function $g$ is very far from being continuous. It therefore seems as if the notion of continuity cannot be described in terms of connectedness unless one describes the open or closed sets in terms of connectedness and directly translates the notion of continuity into a notion of a connected mapping. 

The condition that the complete Boolean algebra $B$ is saturation homogeneous a very minor restriction since every complete Boolean algebra is a direct product of saturation homogeneous complete Boolean algebras. 

This book is an excellent book for those who want to learn about point-free topology for the first time and as a reference for those who are already familiar with point-free topology. As for recent results in point-free topology, I have recently been researching a duality in point-free topology. My new duality represents all zero-dimensional frames as Boolean algebras along with specified least upper bounds. We therefore define a Boolean admissibility system to be a pair $(B,\mathcal{A})$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ is a subset of the powerset $P(B)$ that satisfies the following properties. 

$Ro(X)$ has a countable Boolean subalgebra $B$ where $Ro(X)$ is the completion of $B$ and $Ro(X)$ has no atoms. 

This conjecture is correct. I claim that if the topological space is minimal $T_{0}$, then the specialization ordering is total. We shall prove this result by contrapositive, so we shall show that if the specialization ordering is not linear, the the topology is not a minimal $T_{0}$. The idea in this proof is similar to the proof that Joel David Hamkins gave for finite spaces. If the specialization ordering is not a linear ordering, then we want to extend the specialization ordering to a larger partial ordering and give that larger partial ordering a smaller $T_{0}$ topology. However, instead of extending the partial ordering all the way to a linear ordering, we shall extend the partial ordering in a minimal way so that we can control the new partial ordering and new topology since Zorn's lemma does not give us much control over the new topology. Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a $T_{0}$-space and let $\leq$ denote the specialization ordering on $X$. Suppose that $\leq$ is not a total ordering. Since $X$ is not total ordering, there are two element $p,q\in X$ with $p\not\leq q$ and $q\not\leq p$. We shall now extend the partial ordering $\leq$ to a larger partial ordering $\preceq$ on $X$ so that $p\preceq q$ in the least way. Define $\preceq$ to be the relation such that $x\preceq y$ if and only if $x\leq y$ or $x\leq p,q\leq y$. I claim that $\preceq$ is a partial ordering, and the proof that $\preceq$ is a partial ordering is a routine verification. Reflexivity: The ordering $\leq$ is clearly reflexive. Transitivity: Now assume that $x\preceq y$ and $y\preceq z$. Then we shall prove that $\preceq$ is transitive in the four following cases: Case 1. $x\leq y;y\leq z$: Clearly $x\leq z$, so $x\preceq z$. Case 2. $x\leq y;y\leq p,q\leq z$: In this case, $x\leq p,q\leq z$, so $x\preceq z$ Case 3. $x\leq p,q\leq y;y\leq z$: We have $x\leq p,q\leq z$, so $x\preceq z$ Case 4. $x\leq p,q\leq y;y\leq p,q\leq z$: We have $x\leq p,q\leq z$, so $x\preceq z$. Symmetry: Suppose that $x\preceq y,y\preceq x$. Then we shall prove $x=y$ in the following four cases: Case 1. $x\leq y;y\leq x$: Clearly $x=y$. Case 2. $x\leq y;y\leq p,q\leq x$: This case is impossible for it implies that $q\leq x\leq y\leq p$ hence $q\leq p$ a contradiction. Case 3. $x\leq p,q\leq y;y\leq x$: This case also impossible since it implies that $q\leq y\leq x\leq p$ which is also a contradiction. Case 4. $x\leq p,q\leq y;y\leq p,q\leq x$: This case is impossible as well since it implies that $p\leq x\leq q$, a contradiction. We therefore conclude that $\preceq$ is a partial ordering. Now give $X$ the topology $\mathcal{S}$ generated by the subbasis $(\downarrow^{\preceq}x)^{c}$ where $\downarrow^{\preceq}x=\{r\in X|r\preceq x\}$. Then $\preceq$ is the specialization ordering on $\mathcal{S}$. I now claim that $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$ and we shall prove this claim by showing that each downset $\downarrow^{\preceq}z$ is closed in $\mathcal{T}$ in two cases. Case 1: $q\not\leq z$. Suppose that $q\not\leq z$. Then $x\preceq z$ if and only if $x\leq z$ or $x\leq p,q\leq z$. However, since $q\not\leq z$, we have $x\preceq z$ if and only if $x\leq z$. Therefore, $\downarrow^{\preceq}z=\downarrow^{\leq}z$, so $\downarrow^{\preceq}z$ is closed in $X$. Case 2: $q\leq z$. Suppose that $q\leq z$. Then $x\preceq z$ if and only if $x\leq z$ or $x\leq p,q\leq z$. However, since $q\leq z$, we conclude that $x\preceq z$ if and only if $x\leq z$ or $x\leq p$. Therefore $\downarrow^{\preceq}z=\downarrow^{\leq}z\cup\downarrow^{\leq}p$, so $\downarrow^{\preceq}z$ is closed in $\mathcal{T}$. We have now shown that each set $\downarrow^{\preceq}z$ is closed in $(X,\mathcal{T})$, so each set $(\downarrow^{\preceq}z)^{c}$ is open in $(X,\mathcal{T})$. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is generated by the subbasis consisting of the sets of the form $(\downarrow^{\preceq}z)^{c}$, we conclude that $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$. Furthermore, we have $\mathcal{S}\neq\mathcal{T}$ since these spaces have different specialization orderings. $\textbf{Remark}$ The minimal $T_{0}$-spaces are in a one-to-one correspondence with the class of all totally ordered sets since every totally ordered set has a unique minimal $T_{0}$-topology. In particular, if $(X,\leq)$ is a totally ordered set, then the unique minimal $T_{0}$-topology on $X$ is generated by the basis consisting of sets of the form $\{x\in X|x>x_{0}\}$. In particular, if $A\subseteq X$, then $A$ is open if and only if $A$ is an upwards closed set and either $A$ has no least element or $A$ has a least element $a$ and $a$ has an immediate predecessor. 

The direction $\rightarrow$ in Lemma 2 is straightforward, but the direction $\leftarrow$ is by descending induction on $x$, then for each $x$ one proceeds by ascending induction on $y$ and for each $y$, one uses ascending induction on $z$. Notice how one uses a descending induction for each variable in $x*(y*z)$ to the left of the operation $*$ and one uses an ascending induction for each variable to the right of the operation $*$. Similarly, one uses a descending induction for $x$ in $x*y$ in Lemma 1 and one uses an ascending induction on $y$ in $x*y$ in Lemma 1 because $x$ is on the left side of $*$ and $y$ is on the right side of $*$. Lemma 2 is needed to prove the following theorem. 

The entire branch of point-set topology as taught in most textbooks has completely unintuitive definitions that obscure the entire subject. For instance, the definition of a topological space in terms of open sets tells you nothing about the meaning of point-set topology. It would be much more clear if topological spaces where originally defined in terms of topological closure operators since closure operators since intuitively we have $x\in\overline{A}$ if the set $A$ touches the point $x$ in some way. Other unnecessarily obscured concepts in point-set topology include the definitions of product topology, subspace topology, Hausdorff spaces, regular spaces, compact spaces, and continuous functions. Furthermore, some definitions are obscured when the spaces are not required to be Hausdorff. For instance, the notions of compactness, paracompactness, regularity, and normality do not have much meaning without the Hausdorff separation axiom. If one has a non-Hausdorff space where every open cover has a finite subcover, then one should call that space quasi-compact and not compact. It is a shame that general topology is taught in such a meaningless fashion. 

The property that you are describing is called coabsoluteness. In other words, two regular spaces are said to be coabsolute if their regular open algebras are isomorphic. In the paper, A Characterization of Coabsoluteness for a Class of Metric Spaces by Catherine Gates, theorem 2.3 says that two locally compact metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ are coabsolute if and only if $d(X)=d(Y)$. Here $d(X)$ denotes the density of $X$, i.e. the $d(X)$ is smallest cardinal such that there is a dense subset of $X$ of cardinality $d(X)$. In particular, the open interval, closed inverval, $S^{1}$, $S^{2}$ and the Hawaiian earring are all locally compact separable metric spaces, so they are all coabsolute. Therefore these spaces all have isomorphic regular open algebras. 

What you call a strongly zero-dimensional space is commonly known as an ultranormal space. An ultranormal space is a Hausdorff space where for every pair of disjoint closed sets $C,D$ there is a clopen set $Z$ with $C⊆Z⊆D^{c}⊆Z⊆D^c$. A strongly zero-dimensional space is a space whose Stone-Cech compactification is zero-dimensional. The ultranormal spaces are precisely the strongly zero-dimensional normal spaces. See my expository for more details on these discussions. So it is true that the $*$-spaces are called extremally disconnected spaces. Finally, there are extremally disconnected spaces which are Hausdorff but not normal (nor even regular) such as this one. In fact, the absolute of a normal space is always completely regular and extremally disconnected but not necessarily normal. 

Yes. Suppose that $J$ is an ideal in $L$ such that $\bigvee^{L}J\not\in J$. Let $\mathcal{Id}(L)$ be the set of all ideals of $L$. Then $\mathcal{Id}(L)$ is a complete lattice. Define a mapping $V:L\rightarrow\mathcal{Id}(L)$ by letting $V(x)=\downarrow x$ for each $x\in L$. Then $V$ is a lattice homomorphism. However, since $\bigvee^{X}J\not\in J$, we have $\bigvee V[J]=J$, but $V[\bigvee J]\neq J$, so $V$ is an incomplete lattice homomorphism. 

We will need the following result from the paper that I mentioned in the comments "An elementary proof and an extension of a theorem of Steinhaus" by M. Kuczma and M. Kuczma that generalizes the Steinhaus theorem. Thm:(Kuczma and Kuczma) Let $A,B$ be sets with positive inner Lebesgue measure and let $f(x,y)$ be a real-valued function of class $C^{1}$ in a region $D\supseteq A\times B$ with $f_{x}\neq 0,f_{y}\neq 0$ in $D$. Then the set $f(A\times B)$ contains an interval. Now, to prove our result we shall assume without loss of generality that $\ell_{1}=\{(x,0)|x\in\mathbb{R}\},\ell_{2}=\{(x,1)|x\in\mathbb{R}\}$ and $\ell_{3}=\{(0,y)|x\in\mathbb{R}\}$. Let $U=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|x\neq y\}$. Then $U$ is the union of the two regions $\{(x,y)|x<y\}$ and $\{(x,y)|x>y\}.$ Let $f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be the function where if $(x,y)\in U$, then $f(x,y)$ is the unique real number such that the points $(x,0),(y,1),(0,f(x,y))$ all fall on the same line. Then any reasonable high school algebra student should be able to tell you that $f(x,y)=\frac{x}{x-y}$. Therefore $f$ is real-analytic on $U$. Also, any calculus 3 student should also be able to tell you that $f_{x}(x,y)=\frac{-y}{(x-y)^{2}}$ and $f_{y}(x,y)=\frac{x}{(x-y)^{2}}$.` Therefore the first partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ do not vanish on the set $U$. If $E_{1},E_{2}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ are sets with positive Lebesgue measure, then there are subsets $A_{1}\subseteq E_{1},A_{2}\subseteq E_{2}$ of positive Lebesgue measure such that either $a_{1}<a_{2}$ for $a_{1}\in A_{1},a_{2}\in A_{2}$ or $a_{1}>a_{2}$ for $a_{1}\in A_{1},a_{2}\in A_{2}$. Therefore the set $A_{1}\times A_{2}$ is completely contained in some region in $U$, so $f(A_{1}\times A_{2})$ contains some interval. We therefore conclude that the set $E_{3}$ defined in the problem must contain some interval as well. 

Separability can be used to study the Stone-Cech compactification of a countable discrete space. Recall that if $X$ is a discrete space, then the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta X$ of $X$ is precisely the set of ultrafilters on $X$. We can therefore use separability to prove facts about ultrafilters without mentioning ultrafilters. First, we use separability to observe that $|\beta\mathbb{N}|=2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$. Since $\beta\mathbb{N}\subseteq P(P(\mathbb{N}))$ as the set of ultrafilters on $\mathbb{N}$, we have $|\beta\mathbb{N}|\leq|P(P(\mathbb{N}))|=2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$. To prove the other direction, let $I$ be a set of cardinality continuum. Then since the product of continuumly many separable spaces is separable, the product space $\{0,1\}^{I}$ is separable. Therefore let $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^{I}$ be a countable dense subset. Then there is a surjective function $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A$. Therefore the function $f$ extends to a continuous function $\overline{f}:\beta\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{I}$. Since the image $\overline{f}[\beta\mathbb{N}]$ is a compact set, the set $\overline{f}[\beta\mathbb{N}]$ is a closed subset of $\{0,1\}^{I}$, so $\overline{f}[\beta\mathbb{N}]=\{0,1\}^{I}$ since $A\subseteq\overline{f}[\beta\mathbb{N}]$. Since $\overline{f}:\beta\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{I}$ is surjective, we have $2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}=|\{0,1\}^{I}|\leq|\beta\mathbb{N}|$, so $|\beta\mathbb{N}|=2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$. Separability may also be used to prove facts about the Rudin-Keisler ordering. The Rudin-Keisler ordering is the preordering $\leq_{RK}$ on the class of ultrafilters where if $\mathcal{U}\in\beta X,\mathcal{V}\in\beta Y$ are ultrafilters, then $\mathcal{U}\leq_{RK}\mathcal{V}$ if there is a continuous $f:\beta Y\rightarrow\beta X$ with $f(\mathcal{V})=\mathcal{U}$ and $f[Y]\subseteq X$. The motivation for the notion of the Rudin-Keisler ordering is that the Rudin-Keisler ordering measures the size of an ultrapower. In particular, $\mathcal{U}\leq_{RK}\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}}$ is elementarily embeddable in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{V}}$ for each first order structure $\mathcal{A}$. The Rudin-Keisler ordering is a pre-ordering on $\beta\mathbb{N}$. One can use separability to show that every subset of $\beta\mathbb{N}$ of size at most continuum has an upper bound in $\beta\mathbb{N}$. Assume that $I$ is an index set of cardinality at most continuum and $x_{i}\in\beta\mathbb{N}$ for $i\in I$. Then $\mathbb{N}^{I}$ is separable since the product of at most continuumly many separable spaces is separable, so there is a countable dense subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{I}$. Therefore let $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A$ be a surjective function. Then $f$ extends to a unique continuous function $\overline{f}:\beta\mathbb{N}\rightarrow(\beta\mathbb{N})^{I}$. The function $\overline{f}$ is clearly surjective, so there is some $x\in\beta\mathbb{N}$ with $\overline{f}(x)=(x_{i})_{i\in I}$. Therefore if $\pi_{i}:(\beta\mathbb{N})^{I}\rightarrow\beta\mathbb{N}$ is the projection mapping, then $\pi_{i}\overline{f}(x)=x_{i}$ for $i\in I$, so $x_{i}\leq_{RK}x$ for $i\in I$. It should be noted that there are very similar proofs of the above two results using independent sets and independent partitions (the proofs using independent sets and independent partitions are essentially the same proof. See Andreas Blass's comment below). Furthermore, the two above results can be generalized to larger cardinals with the same proofs. In particular, if $X$ is a discrete space, then $|\beta X|=2^{2^{|X|}}$. Furthermore, every subset of $\beta X$ of cardinality at most $2^{|X|}$ has an upper bound in $\beta X$. To prove these facts, one uses a generalization of the notion of separability called the density and the generalized proof is very similar to the original proof. If I remember correctly, the book The Theory of Ultrafilters by Comfort and Negrepontis also gives generalizations of these facts to large cardinals such as compact cardinals. I hope the above results clear up any confusion about the importance of separability in non-metrizable spaces.
