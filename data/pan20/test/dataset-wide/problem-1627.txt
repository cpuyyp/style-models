Was there a cable channel called The Puppy Channel, which broadcasted for three years footage purely of puppies? 

TheLocal.de, in an article written in November 2013, before the New Year Eve's sexual assaults of 2015-2016 for which immigrants were blamed, titled 'Legally, just saying no is not enough' also cites a group describing the law this way: 

Is the photo in question digitally faked? The main doubt I have is whether the book, which can easily be modified to have such a rogue title, exists. I'm not skeptical that, given such a book, a bored employee may choose to place a sticker over the word after "Cooking". 

Tony Abbott is Mystifyingly Popular in New Delhi's Facebook Community (by Pedestrian.tv) notes that his Indian likes are still in the minority: 

What happens when your pilots just don't get along? claims that there are "Do not pair" lists where someone can request not to work with another pilot. 

First, the limit for foodstuffs of Cs-134 and Cs-137 is 1,000 Becquerels per kilogram according to the linked page. The student (or the reporter) says that the IEAE limits are "1,450 counts in 10 minutes" (that seems a strange unit to me), which works out at 0.4027777 counts per second, or 0.4 becquerels. Thus, for her to claim that as the limit, she must be measuring 2.5 tonnes of seaweed! However, a bit more searching turned up this document from Japan - on page 3 it says: 

(As far as I can tell, American Health shut down in 2000, so it wouldn't have been that recent...) Recovery from what is not stated, and searching elsewhere reveals at best only a small (often insignificant) improvement using hypnosis versus more conventional treatment. What are the origins of this claim? 

This copy-paste has being doing the rounds of local newspaper letters pages and dodgy hard-core pro-Brexit Facebook pages, etc: 

I'm not really worried about whether ropes were used, or whether the ducking stool was used. Did testing for witchcraft involve a scenario which was guaranteed (say >90% probability) to be fatal to the suspect, either because they drowned, or because they would get executed? 

While I can see the evolutionary advantages in pregnant women being more sensitive to bad smells, I assume that our sense of smell would be limited by the number of receptors, which can't be increased. 

From a tweet with over six thousand retweets, also retweeted by Nazí Paikidze, International Master (IM) and Woman Grandmaster (WGM): 

Regarding only hearing about these claims from his detractors, a seemingly sympathetic accounting of Gandhi confirms that Gandhi had these sentiments about black people. From Wikipedia Mahatma_Gandhi#Gandhi_and_the_Africans: 

In a press release China’s pilot carbon trading market taps UNSW expertise (press release is by the UNSW, which is my employer) 

Wikimedia commons entry, claiming a citation to "Una Storia Segreta" by Lawrence Distasi. The licensing metadata from the picture claims that it is a "work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person’s official duties". 

As far as I understand the technical terms, LTT in the second article implies removing the offending nodule, not the complete gland, which would suggest surgery, but on a smaller scale, whereas the first article implies people just get regular screening and no surgery. So, what is the truth? 

I'm sure I've heard similar stories regarding dogs and even hamsters, but in this Guardian story a vet says: 

When a similar question was posted, a link to three to five days without water being the limit was posted, and given that he was chanting the whole time, I would presume he would have lost quite a lot of fluid through the chanting. Note that he actually is allowed water, but only once halfway through just to wet his lips, and he must return the cup without any noticeable decrease in the amount. Although he is the 13th person to complete since 1945, no mention was made on any of the news about anyone dying during the ritual. So, could this be done by a dedicated monk? 

The English language Wikipedia article on Kintetsu states that "Kinki Nippon Tourist Travel Agency" is a subsidiary of Kintetsu Corporation. $URL$ itself states that it is Kinki Nippon Tourist Company 

The Beginner's Guide to C++, from 1994, by the Russian-sounding name Oleg Yaroshenko also uses the phrase. FBIS Daily Report: Central Eurasia, Issues 241-252, published in 1992, quotes someone saying that both the Russians and the Chinese have this expression. There's a couple of scenarios I can think of: 

Elsewhere in the Daily Mail article, it's written that he called for camps for Gaza residents to be located until they leave Gaza: 

Is this pamphlet, apparently published by the Swedish government (the web site involved would be an extremely elaborate hoax if it was made up by extremists), a guide for men who've "married" a child on how to use the Swedish welfare system? 

And at least a passenger organisation (not an airline organisation) has guidelines about this. From Curious cuts to in-flight films 

So, we have our 0.4 Bq figure, perhaps, but per square centimetre, but both Cs's are gamma emitters... To conclude, I can only say that I suspect she has made some sort of false assumption or misreading of nuclear contamination data somewhere along the way. [I'm also exceptionally suspicious of the seaweed being from China - who knows what other pollutants might be in that] UPDATE: I believe this is a better link that includes a photo of her Geiger counter, which is a bog-standard one, not a specialised food-measuring one. She also says: 

This blog seems to be the origin of a quote that has been widely copy-pasted by many hypnotherapists: 

This Japanese site (selling energy drinks) (English auto-translate) mentions that during World War 2 eyeballs were plucked from fish, dried, and sent to the Japanese troops as a source of vitamin B1, and they also mention that there is a lot of DHA and EPA in them. For your more simple question, here is a recipe for boiled in vinegar tuna eyeballs. 

Was this amendment proposed? I'm not an expert on US law, so I don't know what "proposed" means. I tried doing a Google search, but got a lot of user-generated content. 

Are the people holding up their arms to swear to vote for him, as opposed to, say, raising their hand to agree or disagree with a question he asked? 

In Media making up the mob: Journalists amid protesters in Ferguson, Mo. in the Washington Post, it's claimed there's as many media staff as protestors in Ferguson: 

The bibliography is on this page, but it may not be in them if it's from a book compiling quotations. The quote isn't listed in Wikiquote. Did she make the above quote about curfews? 

Did a firefighter rescue cats from a house while it was still burning? Or was it more a case of helping them out after the fire had been extinguished? 

Wikipedia has a list of them at List of close election results. It lists several cases where the vote was tied, or had margins of one or more vote, but most of the cases it lists are individual seats being decided by a single vote, rather than the balance of power in parliament/congress. The only vote with wider significance would be the Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1839. Wikipedia claims that Marcus Morton won by two votes, which would mean that one person could have changed the margin from 2 votes to a dead heat. However, it doesn't provide a citation. 

There we go. One Bq is one count per second, and last time I checked there were 600, not 1,450 seconds in 10 minutes. Furthermore, she is using a surface contamination figure, as I suspected, so I wonder if the experimental procedure was to cut out a 1 cm square of seaweed and sit it on top of the detector for ten minutes? My updated conclusion: yes, false assumptions leading to a meaningless experiment. Junk. Here's a detailed description of how to measure surface contamination properly. 

(Followed by a local address) Skipping the political issues, the closest reference I could find was the Anglo-American Loan of 1946 of around $5 billion which took 60 years to pay back. Were there other loans, or how could $5 billion become $120 billion? 

The story appears to be that captive dolphins in aquariums have been banned, but what exactly is the "non-human persons" aspect? Does it have any force in law?
