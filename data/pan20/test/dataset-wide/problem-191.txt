A really simple question - if you built a space elevator then you continue building past the geostationary point to put tension onto the tether. Now if you keep building out further and further the end of the tether is moving faster and faster. In theory if you keep building out then eventually you are going faster than earth's escape velocity. So my question is just how feasible would it be to build something like that and use it to launch ships on their way? By picking the right launch window you could send ships to anywhere in the solar system for virtually no fuel usage. To be specific: 

It's due to the nature of vampires, and their regenerative state. If a metal or other non-organic substance is thrust into their body then over time their regenerative abilities will push it out. Even if they are completely impaled the stake will gradually migrate as the body moves to one side of the coffin or the other. Use a material that was once alive though (wood is most common but bone would also work) and the regeneration extends to that material and causes it to fuse with the body and trap the vampire in a disabled state. Wood is ideal as over time it actually sprouts roots that spread through the vampires body and immobilize it permanently. 

Well, do you mean all oxygen everywhere or just free oxygen in the air? If it's all oxygen everywhere then everyone dies, the end. If it's just the free oxygen in the air then not much will change. All fires would go out. They may re-ignite once the oxygen returns. Most people wouldn't even pass out, although they may feel a bit light headed or dizzy. Someone who was already swimming or holding their breath or struggling to breathe already might be badly effected. The longer you extend the period without oxygen though the more drastic the consequences would be and the more and more people would be affected. 

Yes, this is completely possible today. In fact we already have large elements of it. We have submarines and submersibles, we have diving gear. There are underwater hotels. You have two basic choices for the buildings: 

One of the main reasons our vehicles can travel so far and so fast is not the use of wheels, it is the fact that they are using fossil fuels or other stored high density energy. Just using wheels alone does not solve that problem, after all a human cyclist is faster than a human runner - but they are still not as fast as a car. 

I've not done any math but I'm pretty sure the answer is no. On Mars you get an atmospheric pressure of 0.6% that here on earth. In other words our atmosphere has over 166 times as much pressure and a 10mph wind on Earth has 166 times as much power behind it as it does on Mars. This means that even fast moving martian winds would not have enough power behind them to turn a wind turbine. You would get much better results with either solar or nuclear power. 

There could be something to do with the monsters themselves. Perhaps they only come out at night, or at certain seasons, so there might be several months of the year or hours of the day where it is safe to go out and farm your crops. The locals would of course know when it is and isn't safe and plan accordingly. 

Most aliens tend to be humans with bumpy foreheads and/or pointy ears. Even when they do have differences then usually it is an entire species being portrayed as a particular brand of human. For example races might be based on Vikings, or Mongols, or Japan in their culture and viewpoint. Even famous sci-fi examples like the Daleks or Vulcans are just a particular brand of human turned up to 11. When creating alien (whether sci-fi alien or other species in a fantasy setting) viewpoints how do you actually make them seem alien? Are there any ways that we as humans can simulate non-human thought patterns and portray them in a convincing way to other humans? 

The obvious answer would be by trapping sunlight, in the same way that greenhouses tend to be hotter than the air around them. Biological processes could also be used, but that would cost the plant energy so would most likely be avoided. 

It's all about reasons. You need a reason to build there. There are two reason that lots of inaccessible areas got settled in our world. 

Yes. Take any decent model of the earth (you should be able to find plenty online). Load them into a 3d modelling package, for example the free and open source Blender. Get a fracture tool or plugin for Blender. Again there are a wide range to choose from, Google is your friend, and it will depend on how you want the fracturing to happen and how many pieces you want. Apply the fracture tool to the planet. You will then need to do some work to model or paint the inside of the planet but it will give you the surface shape and fractured crust. 

Everything would become slightly heavier. 2% isn't enough to make huge changes, although birds would find it harder to fly. Buildings would be slightly weaker and fall more easily. Trips and falls would become slightly more dangerous, etc. Most buildings, supports, etc we make have far more than 2% redundancy so they would not start collapsing as a result of this change. This would have interesting effects on the orbit of planets though. Suddenly planets are not moving fast enough to maintain their current orbit, that will cause them to fall in towards the sun until they gain enough speed and settle into a new orbit. The new orbit would almost certainly be both more eccentric than the previous one and shorter, the length of the year would change. Equally the moon would shift into an eccentric orbit, and tides would grow stronger. The faster orbit of the moon would also break the tidal lock, causing it to no longer always point one face towards the earth. Over time that would correct but the correction would not be instant. 

This sort of system was used by the book Rocheworld, a.k.a The Flight of the Dragonfly. $URL$ The author had a very well thought out system where collector stations orbiting Mercury (and crewed by people working from a sunhook in Mercury's shadow gathered up the power and sent it out to a lens further out in the solar system. That lens then focused the light and sent it on to the lightsail. With modern laser technology the lens stage may not even be needed, so we could just send the power directly from Mercury. This would be quite a dangerous thing to have and control though, be careful where you aim it! In that example the ship got up to 0.2c, which is similar to that in your article which mentions 0.26c. Even at those speeds though it would still take 107 years. This is not fast enough for relativity to really kick in either, elapsed time for people on board would still be over 100 years, especially once you factor in acceleration and deceleration times. For "launch windows" you need Mercury to be on the right side of the sun as the sail and the target, and stay in it for a while, which means that traveling to a target in line with the plane of the solar system you would be able to launch for say 20 days out of each 88 day Mercurian year and have enough acceleration time before you lost the laser. Multiple sails could be launched to different destinations though and the lasers would switch between them in turn as the planet orbited so you could keep continuous uptime accelerating something. If you were launching up or down then that would not be a problem and you could launch at any time. 

The easiest way to do this is just to pick a sound or a theme for each culture/race/etc and then use that. Some examples: Clicks Alien insectoid race communicates using clicks, so their words tend to be very harsh and certain sounds they just don't use. For example letters that use the lips and tongue a lot like m, n, f, g, h might be gone but there would be a lot of k, x, t, and similar letters. The resulting names tend to be things like Kixstex, Takxas, Vakt, Gatrex Hisses A snake like race might tend to use long syllabic words and favor hissing sounds. Sourassan, Moarasseen, Hashouss, veehamon Meaning A lot of place names in English actually have meaning. Many of these are obvious such as "ford" or "bridge" in a name (i.e. Watford, Cambridge) but others had old-english meanings. For example "ton", "by", and other sounds at the end of a name actually meant something. So you can pick a few sounds that mean something for these aliens and then end all place names with one of those sounds. Other sounds Perhaps they use something like a click or a stop in the word, Tr'lk, Ptr!nk, etc. You need to be careful doing this though as readers may well not know how to sound out the word if it's written like that.
