My view is that if they didn't want you to take the cover letter into account, they should not have given it to you. The goal is not to interview all possible candidates, but that the ones you do interview are likely on paper to be good at the job. You work with what you are given. I have seen some good candidates with terrible resumes or cover letters and they get eliminated from many jobs because of that. (In the cases I am thinking of they got eliminated in round 1 and only looked at again after none of the first group of candidates worked out.) You always end up eliminating some people who might have been good. But as long as you find others who will be good, who cares. I would provide the feedback in such a way that it wasn't specific to the cover letter. For instance I would pick a bunch of technical abilities you need and evaluate on those but those do not have to be specific languages. So I might rate each candidate on such things as: 

Another point of human psychology to consider is that people prefer to get a raise that is actually meaningful in terms of a noticeable difference in their paycheck. So suppose the raise is 3600 a year which works out to 300 a month. Now you see a lower amount after taxes. So that works out to maybe 150 that you can actually spend. If you got the equivalent amount one month at a time, you would get a little more than an extra 10 a month every month, Works out the same but not so encouraging is it? And much easier to fritter away without noticing. If you are paid biweekly like most people it is roughly 7-8 a paycheck before taxes which equates to about 4-5 afterwards. This is not motivating to any person I know. 

You cannot make other people have passion. It sounds as if your team and you are opposites and that is not going to change. You need to: 

The first thing you need to to do today is seek medical help. Go talk to a psychologist about your burnout and get him or her to put you on short-term disability for a 2 weeks to a month. You have a medical issue that you need to fix. In my experience, your office/managers will never believe you are burned out until you seek medical treatment for it. I had a therapist tell me I was required to take a month off once and I looked at him like he had three heads as I could not imagine being allowed to take a month off with all the work. But since it was medical, they had to let me do it and guess what, nothing awful happened as a result. Part of the pressure to perform at this level is being put on you by you not the company. While you are off, spend time with your family and spend some time by yourself. Get out into nature and under no circumstances do any work at home on a work or personal programming project. This is break from your computer work, use it only for social media, writing, or some non-programming related hobby like photography. It is truly critical not to work on any personal programming projects. Doing so could invalidate your medical leave. Next is triage of the workload. Have the therapist document that you are not allowed medically to work overtime for some period. Sit down with your manager and change all the deadlines to ones that can be met in a 40 hour week. Reduce the features asked or push them to another iteration. Work only on the most critical things until they hire more people. Part of why you are burning out is that you have not learned to frame a successful No when asked to work too much. You need to push back every deadline, every feature request, every new project. Do not accept new work without a corresponding delay to work already on your plate. Have a priority list and show them all the things you are doing when they ask for more. Then insist they determine which things to move off the list if they need this to have a priority. Next thing is do not work more than 40 hours a week except the occasional (and I mean once every 3-5 months) emergency. And a real emergency involving production systems that are down, not a fake deadline emergency. Almost all deadlines can be extended. In the long run no one will remember if you delivered on July 12 or August 5. 

Fair warning before you read this, this will not be a pleasant read. You have a bad situation. It is best to face that. I don't see anything in your question that would lead me to want to interview you for any job. You are out of date in your field (and I think most jobs in Physics require that PhD that you appear to have dropped out of) and it sounds as if the most pertinent work experience you have is as a clerk. And you had some type of medical problem that made that job go away too. And you don't even appear to know what field you want to work in. Your problem is that you are basically entry-level and you are too old for entry level. You are 11 years past your Master's degree (I am making the assumption from what you wrote that you did not finish the PhD.) and have no accomplishments to show for it. You don't have a 4 year gap, you have an 11 year gap. This is not something most employers are going to find impressive. You are well past the "just graduated from college" age and you have no work experience so no proof that you can do a job or will be able to stick out past the first problem (and all jobs eventually have problems). Your competition for every job will be people who are graduating this year and they will have the edge on you virtually 100% of the time. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but the work world is harsh. I think your personal best bet is to make your own job by starting a business. As a business owner, no one is going to ask about or are about the gap, all they care about is if you can deliver the promised product or service. Start thinking about what kind of a business you could run and then talk to the good folks at the Small Business Administration (if you are in the US) about how to put together a business plan and how to get funding etc. If you choose to continue to look for an employer instead, you need to treat that job search as your full-time job. You need to spend at least 40 hours a week at it. You will probably need to spend months at it and make hundreds of applications and likely the job you find will not be a very good one because you don't have anything that the better employers will want. (I know this is a bitter pill for someone who got accepted at a prestigious university.) If you get that job, then you need, above all else, to stick it out for at least a year and preferably longer. With your history, you simply can't afford a short-term job no matter how bad the job you get is. 

Personally I am more impressed with someone who finds their own mistake and owns up to it and does something to fix it that somone who tries to pretend it didn't happen. Further, at this point, it could be that no one human has yet looked at the resume, so sending in a correction seems like the lesser of the two risks to me. Of course there may be people who think differently than that, but would you really want to work for somone who would get angry about you making a mistake and fixing it? 

Let's review this. Your profile indicates you are in NC which is a state with at will employment. She has used all her leave, applied for shared leave which she abused. Why are you still employing/paying this person? At the very least she should be put on leave without pay (revoking the use of any further shared leave since she used it for something other than illness if that was why the leave was granted) if HR will not allow her to be fired. If you truly want to find out if she is working elsewhere, you could hire a private detective. But really talk to HR about letting this person go before spending the money. It may be easier to solve this problem than you think. 

Lots of things here. First never go to talk to your boss angry, that will lead to bad things for your career. Give it enough time that you have calmed down. Then don't focus on what happened but on what you can do to get the next opportunity. What has happened in the past can;t be undone, so concentrate on how you can get what you want in the future. Now, frankly, this particular incident is nothing to even be angry about. It is not your boss's job to look out for only you. He has a lot of people to look out for and most likely all of them wanted that opportunity. If you want your boss to push you up to the next rung, you have to show him why you are a better choice than anyone once else, not just assume that because you expressed an interest that you will get all the plum assignments from then on. You have to be proactive and look out for your own career. You have to make sure that people know you want opportunities and when a specific opportunity comes up, then you need to remind the decision makers that you are interested. If you say in November that you want to move to a different type of project, but there are no project openings to move you to until March, is that November conversation something your boss is even thinking about at that point? Probably not. So mentioning something once (especially if it was in passing), is rarely enough to get the best assignments. In your case you appear to have a work queue where anyone can pick up a task. If so, then yes you need to monitor the queue and pick up the tasks you want. Next you have to make sure your performance is such that people want to help you out and that not only do you do your work well, but you make sure others are aware of that. Just because you do not receive any negative performance messages does not mean your performance is good; it means your performance is acceptable. That isn't enough to get the tasks you need to move up in most places. 

Present yourself as yourself. Feel free to state what you think you can bring to the job that sets you apart from everyone else. Companies that like what they see will hire you and you don't want to work for companies where you have to pretend to be something else all the time. At your level, the most critical thing is to not pretend to experience or knowledge you don't have and not to exaggerate what you have (for instance a class in C# is not the same thing as having expert knowledge). Anything you put in Linkedin or your resume can generate questions in an interview including technical questions. Once people identify you as lying, you lose all chances and get a bad reputation in the marketplace. 

If you keep the issues secret and it comes out, your job is at risk. He is asking you to take a risk to protect him from one. This is inherently wrong and unfair of him to put you in such a position and you you should not keep the secret. It is your job to find software issues and you cannot be concerned that reporting them might negatively affect developers. All issues reported might negatively affect developers, particularly the more serious ones. Finding them is the whole reason for your job. Don't compromise your integrity to protecct someone who has no problem at all with throwing you under the bus. 

As someone from the US, this sounds like a normal business day to me. I even had one where 11 hours was the minimum I worked in the last 4 months I was there and 18 hours in a row was common. They burned people out fast (no one stayed more than 6 months), but somehow they didn't seem to care. Depending on the industry, there may be some unwritten norms. There is the letter of the law and what companies actually do and the two may differ. Most companies know that most employees won't take them to court. For an internship which is short-term it might be best to go along with the corporate culture and then ask questions about these things when interviewing for your first job out of school to avoid getting into such a company permanently. You have to pass the internship after all. Companies like this tend to accept the productivity drop or pretend it doesn't exist. However if your industry (like much of the software dev industry in the US) routinely works those hours, you may have much more problems landing that first job. The "it's really important to finish this today and then tomorrow nobody is concerned with looking at what you did or moving it to the next step" thing is just part of the pretty much every work culture I have ever seen across multiple industries. Some managers are worse about it than others. But I have worked many a weekend to finish something that absolutely had to be one someone's desk before 8 am Monday morning and then they didn't look at it for a couple of week. Your priorities are set by your boss, don't worry about what priorities other people have. It will drive you crazy.
