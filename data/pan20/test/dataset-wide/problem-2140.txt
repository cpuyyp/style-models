There is no valid reason for anyone involved in hiring, except your actual employer who must send your tax payments to the IRS, to have any portion of your social security number. Do not give it to anyone unles you are filling in the HR paperwork on your first day. Never do it at anytime before your first day aactaully at work. If a recruiter asks for it, that is an indicatior that he or she is shaky ethically and thus not to be worked with. 

If they are planning to outsource, they will keep this a business secret until the day they lay people off. This is standard in any possible layoff situation. No one will tell employees months ahead of when they are ready to lay them off. From a business perspective, it would not be in the shareholder's best interests because they will lose people they need right now and thus they have a fiduciary duty not tell you in advance. There may even be legal issues involved in not telling you in advance of either an outsourcing or a possible sale of the comaany and they may not be sharing the information at an attorney's suggestion. Managers have to be able to keep these kinds of business decisions secret until the official announcement. There is no point in getting upset about them doing what is in the company's best interests. That is what they are paid to do. Frankly, I would start looking for another job because this does indicate that something major is going to change soon and your job may well be at risk. Some of you may be retained to work with the offshore group intially, but do you want to bet your livelihood on that? 

If you want to get along in a particular company, you need to follow the cultural norms of that company whether you agree with them or not. Apparently in your company people bring in treats on their birthday. You were wrong not to have done so and made your own situation actually worse. Whether you like the others is not the issue, behaving in the way that is culturally acceptable is. Likely if you made a mistake like this, there are other ways you are failing to meet cultural norms; that could be why some people seem unfriendly to you. You need to sit back and start observing how other people in your company relate to each other and what is and is not acceptable behavior and the adjust your behavior accordingly. Remember, you have to work well with people whether you like them or respect them or not. You are being paid to do this, so like or dislike or hate is irrelevant. 

You should not list any outside of work activities on your resume unless they directly pertain to the job being applied for. Those are inappropriate whether they are religious in nature or sky diving. It would almost never be a positive in the eyes of a hiring official because it shows you lack a fundamental understanding of how to present yourself. The exception to this would be if you were applying to be employed by an Orthodox Christian Church or organization that promotes Christianity such as a religious school. Then the belief is fundamental to the qualification for the job, after all you wouldn't hire an atheist to be the minister at a church would you? And further putting this on the resume indicates to the many people who do not share your faith that you might be someone who will not fit into the secular culture of their workplace. If they are multi-cultural and include people of many faiths, they may be even more concerned about your presentation. My current workplace employees several different types of Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and atheists and those are just the ones I personally know about. We would be concerned about hiring someone who felt it necessary to parade his beliefs in his resume. People are hired based on fit as well as technical skills. Companies like this would be likely to weed you out without an interview unless you are head and shoulders more qualified than the people they do choose to interview. The bottom line is that you are making it harder to get hired by including this and that is just bad for you unless you are unwilling to work anywhere except a place full of other people of your same beliefs. In that case, go for it, it will help weed out the companies you won't be happy with anyway. It may take longer to find a job though. Note there are countries in the world where hobbies and the like can be listed. If you are not in the US, I would suggest checking with some other people in your country about what is appropriate on a resume. Thanks to @Adnan for pointing this out. 

It's called work for a reason. In your career, you will be asked to do many many tasks that don't interest you. You will be expected to do them anyway. You need to get over this sense of entitlement that you only have to do the things you personally think are cool. They are paying you, so they get to choose your assignment based on their needs and you are professionally obligated to do them to the best of your ability. If you don't then you have no business accepting the pay check. You are being asked to do something that can only help you in your career. Ten years from now you might not be programming in either Java or C# but in some language that hasn't even been written yet. Learning new languages/technologies under the pressure to get the project done is part and parcel of your profession. If you are never asked to learn new stuff or to solve the problems that your current tool set doesn't solve well, that is a signal that you aren't considered to be capable of doing senior level work. So it is a compliment to you that you have been asked to work outside your comfort zone. Don't blow it by whining about being asked to do something you didn't want to do. How you start your career is critical to your overall success. You want to become the go-to person. You want to get the respect of the people above you in the hierarchy as well as your peers. Yes, even the old people like me. They have influence in your oprganization, showing them you are an immature brat who can't be trusted to do the work that needs to be done is the fast track to not being employed and to being blacklisted among their friends who probably work in most of the other comapnies in your area. Think about that for a few minutes. PS - you probably don't know as much about Java programming as you think you do either. Virtually all trainees overestimate their skills. 

I am a woman. I have had to deal with these types of people repeatedly especially when I was young (the workplace was much worse in those days about harrassing behavior being acceptable). I have seen a lot of other women put in the postion of dealing with these types of people. First, you have to stand up and look out for yourself. You describe him as perverted. Follow your own instincts that are telling you to stay away from this person as much as possible. Try never to be alone with him. Never be in a room with a closed door. Protect yourself. Always trust your instincts when someone makes you feel uncomfortable. And if other people shy away from him as well, trust their judgement as well and do the same. This person is NOT your friend. He has bullied and harrassed you. Spend as little time with him as your jobs allow. If you can get away from him without having to make a complaint, you personally will be better off. Now as to dealing with it. There are several approaches but it is incumbent on you to make sure that you first directly tell this person not to leer at women in front of you and not to talk about it when you are present. You do not have to put up with this behavior. Be crystal clear, if he says this is normal behavior, challenge that and tell him in no uncertain terms that the behavior is not acceptable to you and not acceptable in the work place. Some others have suggested possible ways to word it, think carefully about what you want to say. Women tend to say these things in a more indirect manner, this is a case where you have to be direct. If he does this in public, tell him in public that you don't appreciate it. If you need to escalate to HR, it is preferable that others have seen you actually tell this person that the behavior was unacceptable to you. Do this calmly without getting angry or upset. Talk to some other women in your office about how they would handle such a thing. You need to know what the organizational norm is for this. Some places will be accepting of harrassing behavior and will think you are in the wrong no matter what you do. You need to know this before you choose to do something beyond asking him to stop. (This would of course be a good reason to look for a better place to work!) You will also need allies if this thing goes further. The next step after you ask him to stop if he doesn't stop is usually to talk to your boss and ask him to ask the guy to stop the unprofessional behavior because it makes you feel uncomforatble. Most bosses are much more aware of how harrassment is unacceptable in the workplace, so many of them will try to fix it before it becomes an HR issue that embarrasses them and hurts their own career. (Incidentally, you want to work for the supportive bosses for many reasons beyond protection from harrassment, so make sure to evaluate the personality of the boss when you look for jobs in the future.) If at all possible do not go to HR with this unless you are in fear or the behavior increases in frequency or esclates after you ask him to stop. Do not go to HR unless you have actual proof of the behavior, otherwise it is a useless exercise of he said/she said. Document the day you tell him not to do this anymore and document every incident after that day. If possible get witnesses (many people won't want to get involved, don't be shocked at this.). If you have a personnel manual, check out what it says about how to handle harrassment. You may also need to to make sure that other men in your group know that you are not one to complain at any slight thing. It can make your work relationships very awkward if you put in a harrassment complaint. People will be afraid of you. So you need to think of how to make sure that other people understand that this was way beyond the bounds, not ordinary office joking around. One way to do this is to be relaxed around other males in the office and to laugh at jokes. You do not want to be perceived as a humorless B*#ch out to get any man. You need to have developed good relationships with your other co-workers before doing this. And it is hard to put into words, but you want to make sure you are not expecting one standard from this guy and allowing other guys you like more to have more latitude. So being friendly with the other co-workers is fine line to define, be friendly and laugh at jokes, but not ones the same or worse than what you are complaining about. In other words, don't give out a mixed message. And do not put yourself in a position where people will think it is all your fault. So no flirting, no sexy clothes. Never at work. Yeah I know that is unfair, but life is unfair. I have seen that it is easier for people to accept where you draw the line, if you are consistent about it. I have seen very religious women who are offended by even the mildest profanity treated far better for speaking up than women who are perceived as inconsistent (people don't know when they might suddenly find themselves defending against a complaint) or sexy (you will be perceived as at fault) who complain about far more serious behavior. Above all, never make the complaint to HR the first step. No one will ever trust you. You want to have a track record of being good at your job as well. Yes I know that no one should be harrassed, but in all honestly, if he is perceived as good at his job and you are perceived as not so good, the he said/she said thing will come down in his favor. In the long run if the situation does not change, one of you could be leaving, so make sure the company wants you to be the one they keep.
