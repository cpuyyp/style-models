I was looking for a simple example of a covariant derivative on a bundle, where the bundle is not projective. If necessary, the example could be from complex or noncommutative geometry, but I would hope for a simple example with the usual calculus on a manifold. In noncommutative geometry, there is a theorem by Cuntz and Quillen saying that for the universal calculus, a module on an algebra has a covariant derivative if and only if the module is projective. The universal calculus should be the most restrictive in this context, there should be other calculi with non-projective modules having covariant derivatives. I suspect that algebraic geometry has lots of these, but I would like an easy one to explain! Added: I guess that an example might be based around a skyscraper sheaf, but I don't see how to give such a thing a connection! (I am likely being stupid here...) 

Given a nontrivial left ideal $J$ of a unital $C^*$ algebra $A$, is there a state on $A$ which vanishes on all elements of $J$? (Left or right doesn't matter, just not 2-sided.) The problem came from the idea of a state as evaluation at a 'point' of a noncommutative space. If an ideal corresponds to a vanishing 'set', then can we look at 'points' of that 'set'? I must admit that this problem as I stated it sounds unlikely to be true, but is there another version which might work? I would also be interested in any related references which people could suggest about the theory of 1-sided ideals in operator algebras. 

This question is about the states on the matrix quantum group $C_q[SU_2]$ (generators $a,b,c,d$ with relations...), or possibly about the representations of the $C^*$ algebra $C_q[SU_2]$ - not about its co-representations. I stress this, as there is a vast literature about the co-representations. Motivation: To generalise the idea of a quantum homogenous space. The quantum Hopf fibration is given by a Hopf algebra map $\pi:C_q[SU_2]\to C[S^1]$, giving a right coaction $\Delta_R=(id\otimes\pi)\Delta:C_q[SU_2]\to C_q[SU_2]\otimes C[S^1]$, and the coinvariants give a quantum sphere. The problem is to generalise this sort of construction by replacing the Hopf algebra map $\pi$ with a completely positive map with some reasonable behaviour. However CP maps are not that easy to come by - the most obvious being the states. Woronowicz gave a construction of the Haar state on $C_q[SU_2]$, but what other explicit states are known? The obvious source would be star representations of $C_q[SU_2]$, but finding these is not so easy. Any help on this would be gratefully received - I am sure that I am overlooking some obvious source of information... 

Over a noncommutative algebra $A$ we have no problem in defining invertible bimodules (as in the book by Bass on algebraic $K$-theory) - corresponding to line bundles over topological spaces $X$ if $A=C(X)$. Further we can make these into a group (the Picard group) by taking the group operation $\otimes_A$. However after quite a bit of searching I cannot find examples where the resulting Picard group is itself nonabelian. I would be very pleased if people could point out examples where Picard group is nonabelian - I assume that they do exist, since there is no obvious reason why it should be abelian (I think... I may be wrong...). Examples where $A$ is a star algebra would be especially welcome. This question came from considering the properties of `line bundles' over non commutative spaces, and noncommutative algebraic geometry. Apologies if it is well known in some circles! 

In the algebra of matrices $M_n(A)$ over a $C^*$ algebra $A$, consider the corner algebra $PM_n(A)P$ for a Hermitian projection $P\in M_n(A)$. Is there any condition known for $P$ to make $PM_n(A)P$ isomorphic to $A$? If not, where should I look for what is known on the structure of $PM_n(A)P$? (This question is aimed at linking the peoperties of $P$ to $PM_n(A)P$ in general, rather than for the case of specific $C^*$ algebras.) The background: A Morita context from $A$ to itself can be viewed as a left finitely generated projective $A$-module $L$ whose left module maps are themselves isomorphic to $A$ - thus giving a bimodule structure. If $L$ has associated projection matrix $P$ in $K$-theory, then the left module maps are given by the corner algebra $PM_n(A)P$, thus the question of when this is isomorphic to $A$. (This is the noncommutative analogue of a line bundle in geometry.) 

Take a (unital) algebra map $f:A\to B$ between two unital C* algebras - not necessarily star preserving. Under what circumstances is there a $b\in B$ so that $g(a)=b\ f(a)\ b^{-1}$ is a star algebra map? If not, is there another method of modifying $f$ to get a star algebra map? 

Take the variety $X$ to be $\mathbb{C}_\infty \times\mathbb{C}_\infty $ with the points $(0,0)$ and $(\infty,\infty)$ removed. Use coordinates $(z,w)\in\mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{C}$ for one chart of the product of the two Riemann spheres. Then $\xi\in\Omega^{0,1}X$given by \begin{eqnarray*} \xi\,=\,\frac{z\,\mathrm{d}\bar z+w\,\mathrm{d} \bar w}{|z|^2+|w|^2}\ . \end{eqnarray*} has $\bar\partial\xi=0$ so we have $[\xi]\in \mathrm{H}^{0,1}(X;\bar\partial)$. My questions are: 1) What is $ \mathrm{H}^{*,*}(X;\bar\partial)$ ? 2) Is $[\xi]\neq 0$ ? 3) Is there a holomorphic sheaf $S$ on $X$ whose $\mathrm{H}^0(X;S)$ gives $ \mathrm{H}^{0,1}(X;\bar\partial)$ (assuming that the latter is nonzero). 4) What is the place to look for methods used for this sort of problem? Now the background: First I am obviously not an expert in algebraic geometry, so I apologise to those who are for posing this question. The motivation comes from higher dimensional Lorentz invariant soliton theory, about which almost nothing is known. (Richard Ward's construction of a 2+1 dimensional soliton equation by the mini-twistor method being an exception.) The method I am considering is generalising the inverse scattering method to higher dimensional varieties, and the obvious thing to do is to look for geometric objects 'localised' on singularities of codimension more than one. (In the same sense that a meromorphic function is described by poles 'localised' on a point in dimension one.) The variety $X$ above is an obvious place to start for a 2+1 Lorentz invariant system, as it corresponds to the variety $t^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$, and removing the 2 singular points (not obvious but changing variables checks that other points are regular) for the given 0,1 form. If anyone would be interested in discussing this possible geometric approach to finding higher dimensional soliton systems I would be very happy to do so. (I use 'soliton system' for the reason that such systems might not be classically integrable systems) 

The literature has definitions (seemingly plural, though they might be linked) of a $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra. But is there any link of these to a $q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra? (Classically there is an expression for $L_n$ in terms of a normal ordered quadratic in the generators of the Heisenberg algebra.) I would be grateful for a reference to somewhere that discusses this in terms understandable to a non-expert in conformal field theory. However anything to shed light on the current status of the q-Virasoro and q-Heisenberg algebras, or relates them to the undeformed theory, would be of interest. Apologies for my ignorance on this subject, as I pointed out I am certainly not an expert in CFT. I am currently trying to sort this out as an example of the action of vector fields in noncommutative geometry... 

There seems to be a result for formal series (I hope this is right) for all integer $r\ge 0$ $$ \sum_{n\ge 0} (-x)^n\ {{n+r}\choose{r}}_{q} = (1+x)^{-1}(1+qx)^{-1}\dots (1+q^{r}x)^{-1} $$ where the $q$-binomial coefficients are written in terms of the $q$ integers $[t]=1+q+\dots+ q^{t-1}$. This is a fairly direct analogue of the classical negative binomial theorem (careful choice of $x$ will make it convergent). I was hoping that someone could give a reference for where to find this - it does not seem to be trivial to prove. Apologies for not knowing what is likely a very standard reference! 

Consider two quadratic algebras based on the vector space $\mathbb{R}^3$ with basis $x,y,z$. The antisymmetric tensor algebra $\Lambda \mathbb{R}^3$ obviously has zero divisors, e.g. $(x)(xy)=0$, but the symmetric tensor algebra $S \mathbb{R}^3$ has not, as it is isomorphic to the polynomial functions on $x,y,z$. For $\Lambda \mathbb{R}^3$ the existence of zero divisors is obvious at degree 1, as $x^2=0$. We could ask this more generally for a possibly noncommutative quadratic algebra with relations $R\subset V\otimes V$ - when is the quadratic algebra $Q(V,R)$ an integral domain? To give a more specific question, if $Q(V,R)$ an not integral domain, then are there always examples of zero divisors in degree 1, i.e. $x,y\in V$ so that $xy\in R$? Apologies if this is well known - could you give me a reference for a proof or counterexample if it is! The question arose from trying to generalise the behaviour of the symbols of differential operators, where classically $SV$ is an integral domain, to operators with other relations. 

OK, on more thought (apologies, I didn't think about things the right way before...): Let $A=C^\infty(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$ (just to keep to a compact manifold), and $B$ be the algebra of complex valued power series with coefficients decaying faster than any power. The Taylor expansion at the point zero gives an algebra map $T_0:A\to B$, and we use this map to make $B$ into a left $A$-module. There is a connection $\nabla:B\to\Omega^1 A\otimes_A B$ (with the usual calculus on $A$) defined by $$ \nabla \big(\sum_{n\ge 0} b_n\,x^n\big)=dx\otimes \sum_{n\ge 0} n\,b_n\,x^{n-1}\ . $$ Now suppose that $\theta:B\to A$ is a left $A$-module map. Then for all $b\in B$ and $f\in A$, $\theta(T_0(f)\,b)=f\,\theta(b)$. If there is a $b\in B$ so that $\theta(b)\neq 0$, then there is an $y\in\mathbb{R}$ so that $y\neq 0$ and $\theta(b)(y)\neq 0$ (this as $\theta(b)$ must be continuous). Now choose a smooth function $f$ so that $f(y)\neq 0$, but $f$ vanishes on a neighbourhood of zero. We get a contradiction. Thus the only left $A$-module maps $\theta:B\to A$ must be zero, and in particular $B$ cannot be a projective module, as then it would be a submodule of a free module, and free modules have lots of such maps. 

Consider a cubic lattice of space probes, with rocket motors and lasers to measure distance, and a clock to measure time. As they more from free space to the vicinity of some black hole, they try to move to keep the same distance from each other. However, they can't do that exactly, but what is the best they can do? Effectively the probes are defining their own spatial 3D coordinate system, which is as much like the cubic lattice as possible. Alternatively, as is stated in the title, how rigid can a rigid object be in GR? A bit of analysis leads me to the following guess, which is likely wrong, or at best true only infinitesimally. I am sure that there is a better answer already out there, and I am hoping that someone knows it. I guess that the answer may be something like the following, for coordinates $x^1,x^2,x^3$ in an approximation to flat space (curvature `small'): $g_{ii}$ can be chosen to be independent of $x^i$. $g_{ij}$ can be chosen to be independent of $x_k$, for $i,j,k$ all different. To be more specific, it seems that for a close approximation to Minkowski space, the rate of change of $g_{12,1}+g_{13,3}-g_{22,1}-g_{33,1}$ (and permutations thereof) is forced by the components $T_{0i}$ of the stress energy tensor. This problem comes from considering the detailed initial setup of geodesic coordinates on a Lorentzian manifold. 

Here is a cohomology theory for a Hopf algebra, which I am sure has appeared elsewhere. I met it in the van Est spectral sequence for Hopf algebras. Apologies for my being stupid here, but it would be really helpful if someone would tell me where it comes from, and where to look for results on it! Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $\lambda: F\to H\otimes F$ be a left $H$-comodule, which we write in Sweedler notation $\lambda(f)=f_{[-1]}\otimes f_{[0]}$. Define $D^{n}=H^{\otimes n+1}\otimes F$ for $n\ge 0$, with the tensor product left $H$-coaction. The differential $ d:D^{n}\to D^{n+1}$ with $ d^2=0$ is defined by $$ d(h_{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes h_{n}\otimes f)\,=\, \sum_{n+1\ge i\ge 0}(-1)^{i}\, h_{0}\otimes\ldots\otimes h_{i-1}\otimes 1_H \otimes h_{i}\otimes\ldots \otimes h_{n}\otimes f\ . $$ As $ d$ is a left $H$-comodule map, we can restrict the complex to the invariants to give $({}^{coH}D^{n}, d)$, and the cohomology of the invariants is what I am looking for. The invariants are taken over the tensor product coaction on all factors. There is an explicit reformulation of the cohomology without taking invariants, and seemingly without requiring an algebra structure, though showing an isomorphism is awkward, and does require Hopf algebra structure: Define a cochain complex $(G^{*},\bar d )$ by $G^{n}=H^{\otimes n}\otimes F$ for $n\ge 0$ with $\bar d f=1_{H}\otimes f-\lambda(f)$ for $f\in F$ and \begin{eqnarray*} \bar d (h_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n}\otimes f) &=& 1_{H}\otimes h_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n}\otimes f\,-\, \Delta(h_{1})\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n}\otimes f\,+\,\dots \cr &&+\,(-1)^{n}\,h_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes \Delta(h_{n})\otimes f\,-\, (-1)^{n}\,h_{1}\otimes\dots\otimes h_{n}\otimes \lambda(f)\ . \end{eqnarray*} I guess that the comment below on the dependence on a coalgebra structure is then correct... 

This is about the differential idea of a sheaf as a vector bundle $E$ (not necessarily locally trivial) on a real manifold $M$ with a zero curvature connection $\nabla$. The zeroth cohomology is then the sections of $E$ with zero derivative, and this extends to higher degrees. The things I am going to ask about have answers in terms of the pre sheaf / open set definition of sheaf, but I want to be more restrictive for the following reason: I am looking at non commutative geometry where there is currently no satisfactory idea of restriction to an open set, but there are established ideas of differential calculus. I am hoping that there are existing classical answers, so that some form of provisional non commutative definitions can be formed. I am aware that using this differential approach has disadvantages, but from a noncommutative setting there are limited options given the current state of the theory. Possibly the differential way of looking at sheaves is most familiar from algebraic geometry. 1) The skyscraper construction: Given a vector bundle $F$ over $\mathbb{R}$ with a zero curvature connection, form a similar construction for $\mathbb{R^2}$ for a bundle with support on the $y$-axis, and which is just $F$ when restricted to the $y$ axis. (Is this still a skyscraper sheaf when its support is a line? I decided that a point was too much of a special case to see what was happening. Probably not, but never mind.) 2) Is there a definition of a push forward sheaf for the differential definition above? Given a smooth map $f:M\to N$, what is the push forward of the construction $(M,E,\nabla)$ above? 

Classically the group of Moebius transformations of the unit disk and Moebius transformations of the upper half plane are isomorphic, as the unit disk and upper half plane are transformed into each other by another Moebius transformation. We can ask whether the isomorphism of groups works in the noncommutative case, even if the underlying motivation may not work. The quantum groups $C_q[SU_{1,1}]$ and $C_q[SL_{2}(R)]$ are the same as Hopf algebras (the same as $C_q[SU_{2}]$), but they have a different star structure: $$ C_q[SU_{1,1}]:\quad q^*=q,\quad \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}^*=\begin{pmatrix}d&q^{-1}c\\ qb&a\end{pmatrix}$$ $$ C_q[SL_{2}(R)]:\quad q^*=q^{-1},\quad \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{pmatrix}^*=\begin{pmatrix}a& q^{-1} b\\ q c&d\end{pmatrix}$$ Well, there is another complication - the $q$s have to change, as one is real and the other is on the unit circle, so we really ask if there is an isomorphism $C_q[SU_{1,1}] \cong C_p[SL_{2}(R)]$ for $p$ a function of $q$. Also the determinants may vary - strictly the Mobeius groups are projective $PSL_2(R)$, or alternatively we might work without the determinant=1 condition on $GL_2(R)$ - whatever is needed to get an interesting noncommutative result. 

I am sure that this is well known in the right places, but: Is the C* completion of a star nuclear Fréchet algebra a nuclear C* algebra? (Suppose that the C* norm is continuous with respect to the Fréchet topology.) [Basic, but commutative, example to explain topology - smooth functions on a compact manifold completed to continuous functions.] To explain more: I expect that if the result was true, all that would be needed would be that the product and star were continuous. If we take continuous seminorms $\|.\|_1 \le \|.\|_2 \le \dots$ then likely we should have $\|a\,b\|_n\le C\, \|a\|_m\,\|b\|_m$ where $m,C$ just depend on $n$. By C* completion, this would be via some star representation of the algebra on a Hilbert space $H$, so that the map from the algebra to $B(H)$ was continuous. 

Consider a function $f:\mathbb{CP}^1\times\mathbb{CP}^1\to \mathbb{CP}^1 $ defined by $f([x_1,x_2],[y_1,y_2])=[x_1y_1,x_2y_2]$. This function is well defined except at $([0,1],[1,0])$ or vice versa (in therms of the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{C}_\infty$ we do not have a well defined zero times infinity). Now consider a function $g:U\to\mathbb{C}$ analytic in in a neighbourhood $U$ of $([0,1],[1,0])$ in $\mathbb{CP}^1\times\mathbb{CP}^1$. I am looking for a way to define some sort of numerical value of residue to the product $fg$ at the point $([0,1],[1,0])$. I am looking for any possible definition of `residue' which make sense and is invariant to change of coordinates. This may be in terms of integral on a polydisk (feel free to introduce a Kahler form if it makes things easier). It may be in terms of cohomology (as long as it is calculable and not completely abstract). Anything will do. The motivation lies in the theory of integrable systems, and there there is a rather unsatisfactory answer - define a standard example as you wish, and then use the huge number of symmetries of the integrable system to define the other cases which can arise. Of course this may do a particular job, but in general is not a good way to proceed, so I am looking for a more sensible theoretical definition. (I am obviously not an expert in algebraic geometry, all I can say is that from a physical point of view, such a construction seems possible.)
