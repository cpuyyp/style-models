As a westerner and former southern baptist perhaps I can shed a little light on what Buddhism has taught me. Keep in mind my views aren't necessarily the same as everyone else's with regards to Buddhist dharma (teachings). First, the concept of a "soul" is tricky. You're not going to find it called a "soul" in most Buddhist teachings. And this is not just because of the name, but also the difference between individuality and commonality. In general the western view of a "soul" implies a self. A distinct individual that will go on after the demise of its' physical form. That is a concept foreign to most all Buddhist thought. But the delineation does become clouded when we reach the idea of rebirth because rebirth implies individuality. How do we distinguish? The Isha upanishad tells us that the self is one and everywhere. Instead of calling it the "self" let's call it "awareness". Awareness exists inside us as the chariot driver (Katha upanishad) and the perceptions and sensations and experiences are all part of the 5 aggregates of existence (as taught by the Buddha). Think of it as a balloon being filled from the air around us and then tied off. The air is awareness and the balloon in whole is the person. Whereas before the awareness was boundless and timeless now it can only experience thru limited perceptions and is affected by the ravages of time. Ideally the air would just remerge into the whole when the body dies. BUT ... there is the issue of karma. Things we do have effects to the world around us and to the quantum world we live within. The double-slit experiment in physics double slit experiment explanation shows us that those very perceptions alter the reality around us, not just now but into the future (and perhaps even the past). This means we changed something and there are ongoing changes or effects that would bear weight upon and potentially alter us but for our physical death. This isnt just some hocus-pocus hogwash either - we are starting to discover it has a physical component in this world and alters our awareness' ability to merge back into the neutral ether. quantum change causes alterations in our cells Here I interject "black box theory" to signify I understand the effects but not the mechanism. So, in short, we are awareness temporarily limited to residing in this human vessel and when it passes that awareness goes elsewhere. I believe we will eventually find that meditation allows us to clear these micro-tubules in the brain and clear the karmic effects we have initiated and living a simple life while walking the median path brings us closer to preventing rebirth and peacefully going back to the whole. I have found peace in Buddhism that I never had as a Christian just for this reason. I hope this helps you understand. namaste. damayata datta dayadhvam. 

I can’t disagree with any others answers advocating this or that practice. But what jumps to my mind is the Buddhist teaching all conditioned things - those arising from causes* and conditions are impermanent. Thus ultimate extinguishing, Nimbanna, is beyond conditions or causes. But, as one uses a raft to cross a river and then abandons it, causes and conditions may be used to reach the unconditioned, and uncaused, which I think cannot be spoken of, or should not if it could be. 

Eckart Tolle describes what I understand as a spontaneous awakening in his book “The Power of Now.’ His experience was not within the context of Buddhist meditation practice, and for me it misses the connection and explanations of an individual ‘experience’ to Buddhist teachings. Though American Zen Buddhist often adopt the ‘no scriptures’ rebellion of monks forced to endlessly recite and memorize scriptures, I believe study of Buddhist scriptures is beneficial to American Buddhists in order to build framework of reference for walking the Buddhist path. In short, it might be good to look to Buddhist teachings to put your experience in that framework. Then again, you could work with your experience within any frame of reference, or none or none. 

"Understanding" is our linear, time-limited conception of mental awareness. That is our ability to comprehend things in our world that are beyond our immediate perceptions. Is it a phenomenon? Sure. Will you fall into ignorance? I dont think so. I actually believe in the eternalism of our awareness or consciousness or soul or whatever crafty name we have for it this week. This body is a meatbag that our awareness drives around. Once we are back to pure awareness we will no longer rely on memory or perceptions or understanding. We will experience everything at once in our realm of perception - whatever perception awareness encompasses. We're no longer limited to these crappy perceptions and tools that make us have to piece together fragmented clues of reality to experience something from afar. We just experience it and everything else all at once. 

My dog has run away and I am sad. To be honest I was probably not taking care of him the best as one possibly could. We both excelled or declined based on my success, but I tried to allow him his own freedom and now he is gone. Do I grieve? I mean I know that I am but should I? Is this precisely the type of attachment I should and must choose to sever? This dog has been my friend and cohort for almost 10 years. He helped me recover from heart attacks and multiple surgeries. How could one not grow attached? So should I feel relieved or guilty and sad? I made sure to ask this while he was missing. Now he has since been found and returned. 

Earliest Buddhist texts I think define right view as seeing, understanding, and realizing three characteristics of this world and life: 1) All things are impermanent and continuously changing 2) (because of number 1 and our grasping at things that are ephemeral) there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction and unsatisfactoriness in life. 3) All things, a person, and the world we live in is without an inherent self (selfless) (though we do experience an experiencial self of ourself and the world). I find the third the most subtle and useful. 

Not in any way to be a trick answer, but in the Pali Cannon, Shakyamuni told followers not to take what he said on his word, or any teacher’s reputation, but to investigate oneself. I treat my Buddhism practice as a big experiment, on myself, testing, trying this or that, this teaching or that, this meditation and find what seems to work. But I don’t settle evers than I have any final answer, but follow what seems to work for me. And, my experience is that the Buddhism path is very personal. 

I believe the placement of the 3 scopes is not arbitrary. Graded steps to enlightenment. Wisdom and proper practice are key to personal growth so that one may then attend to the other wing - compassion for others. I believe it is our nature to assist one another. The most efficient way to do that is to cut our own needs and desires completely (to the bare bones at least). In my former version of this life I was devastated to lose my family, my career, and my health all at once. As a Buddhist it was an actual advantage. Attachments were gone. But that's not how everyone could or should do it and it's not what the Buddha was implying. It is merely the absolute we could achieve. And as the acorn should be viewed as the oak ... we should be viewed as our most efficient selves.
