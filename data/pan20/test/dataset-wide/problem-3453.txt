Subsidies are often primarily aimed at increasing the income of the agricultural sector When subsidies lead to increases in production, this can cause the market price to fall with negative effects on agricultural incomes, with much of the benefit flowing through to consumers rather than farmers. This then leads to calls for further subsidies To avoid a spiral of increasing subsidies, governments will often move to a stage which restricts production, and one possibility is to tie the subsidies to given levels of production (often based on previous levels of production or on fixed assumptions about areas and yields), either not paying subsidies on production above some stated level or, in more extreme cases, withdrawing subsidies if production exceeds a quota The aim of such production-limiting subsidies is to maintain subsidies at a level which is sustainable both in terms of market prices and government expenditure. It is in fact a double distortion of the domestic market, both through the subsidies and through the production-limiting elements, but was deemed to be less distorting of international trade than unlimited production-based subsidies 

It is not immediately obvious precisely when the recent US housing crisis took place: prices started declining in 2006 ($URL$ causing disruption in the financial markets in 2007. The peak of the crisis was possibly in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers failed and the mortgage securitizing enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the federal government. 

When preferences are strict, the strong core is unique and the top-trading cycle procedure (TTCP) is the unique mechanism yielding the strong core allocation. Here are the highlights. Lemma 1: Let $x$ be the allocation generated by the Top-Trading Cycle Procedure. Then $x$ is in the strong core. Lemma 2: Let $P$ be the set of players, $\Omega = \{ \omega^{i} = i : i \in P \}$ be the set of initial allocations, and $\succ^{i}$ be the set of strict preferences. We have $(P, \Omega, (\succ^{i})_{i=1}^{|P|})$ as the instance of the house allocation problem. The strong core is unique. Proof: Suppose to the contrary that there exist two allocations $x, y$ in the strong core and suppose $x$ is the allocation returned by the TTCP. As $x \neq y$, $S = \{ i : x_{i} \neq y_{i} \}$ has at least two elements. Observe that if there is a player $i \in S$ such that $x_{i} \succ^{i} y_{i}$, then $x_{i}$ can form a weakly improving coalition with the other players in $x_{i}$'s cycle whose allocations are the same in $x$ and $y$. As preferences are strict, every player in $S$ strictly prefers either $x$ or $y$. We construct a weakly improving coalition to block $y$. Let $i \in S$ such that $y_{i} \succ^{i} x_{i}$. Let $i$ be matched in iteration $k$ of the TTCP. Since $y_{i} \succ^{i} x_{i}$, we have that player $i$ prefers some other house $j$ to $x_{i}$ and that $j$ was assigned in a previous iteration by the fact that $x$ belongs to the strong core. And so using the allocation $y$ displaces the player who received house $j$ under the TTCP. As preferences are strict, each player who received a house when $j$ was allocated under the TTCP can form a weakly improving coalition to block $y$. And so the fact that $S \neq \emptyset$ implies that $y$ is not in the strong core. QED. I actually have a blog entry going into more detail about this: $URL$ 

The percentages are of quarterly GDP. If you wanted exact annual percentages then you should add up the four quarterly figures in Euros and divide by the sum of the four quarterly figures for GDP in Euros (from a different Eurostat table), but you will get a close approximation if you take the average of the four quarterly percentages. So for Greece it might represent a government deficit of around 7.7% in 2015 Be aware that the numbers are not seasonally adjusted: it looks as if a lot of Greek government revenue and expenditure comes in Q4. 

It is an national accounting reason, rather than the Irish people have higher incomes or being more productive It seems that some companies previously deemed to be foreign are now deemed to be Irish, and so their profits now count towards Irish GDP (and, to the extent they are not a subsidiary of a foreign company and retain their profits, also to Irish Gross National Income). The Irish Central Statistics Office said a 26.3% increase in GDP and 18.7% in GNI from 2014 to 2015 at constant prices What may have happened is inversion where United States companies are notionally taken-over by Irish companies (though the old US shareholders remain shareholders of the new merged company), largely to take advantage of Ireland's generous corporation tax regime. That makes their production/value-added/profits appear to be Irish this year, boosting Ireland's GDP compared with last year Further reading from 10 months ago when this was noticed: 

In equilibrium, we have supply equal to demand. So $Q_{s} = Q_{d} \implies 50 = 2p$, so $p^{*} = 25$ is the equilibrium price. Consumer surplus is defined as: $$\int_{p^{*}}^{p_{max}} Q_{d}(p) dp$$ Here, $p_{max} = 50$, as $Q_{s} = 0$ when $p = 50$. So evaluate the integral. Producer surplus is similarly defined as: $$\int_{0}^{p^{*}} Q_{s}(p) dp$$ 

It's hard to make a best advisement given that we don't know your background. One can struggle with proofs for a few reasons: terseness of the presentation, a weak background in the prerequisite material, or a weak background in proof-writing in general. (1) and (3) are generally associated with mathematical maturity. I advise folks interested in economics to pursue an undergraduate degree in mathematics. If that is not feasible or realistic, then I suggest at a minimum some proofs-based work in linear algebra and real analysis. Friedberg's Linear Algebra text is a good exposition and will help you build up some maturity. It's a solid prerequisite for analysis. Once you start talking about the derivative as a linear operator, linear algebra is a must-have. However, linear algebra doesn't otherwise appear in real analysis before that. For analysis, Abbott is friendlier than Rudin, and will likely provide you with sufficient background to move forward. Abbott is geared towards juniors in an undergraduate curriculum, while Rudin is the hard-core senior level text. If you don't have mathematical maturity, Rudin will force you to struggle. Once you have mathematical maturity, the conciseness his writing is quite nice. Fudenberg and Tirole is a very technical, terse book. It is a good reference, but not my favorite exposition into game theory. I might be inclined to look through Maschler, Solan, and Zamir instead. It's gotten good reviews, though I haven't had a chance to look through it myself.So take this with a grain of salt. It is definitely more comprehensive than Fudenberg and Tirole, though. 

There is a futures market for crude oil: for example $URL$ gives a price now for May 2018 of US$\$49.54$ compared with a cash price now of US$\$47.82$ The futures price being higher than the cash price is described as contango and is why there are excess stockpiles of crude oil. In the past the comparison has sometimes been reversed, described as backwardation and associated with low stockpiles. For a graph of this over time, see $URL$ though the relationship is more complicated than described there For historical oil prices the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has several sets of numbers, such as $URL$ going back to 1946 

Later parts of table 2.2 give a breakdown of types of services. Travel (for all purposes including education) - which should not include transport - seems to be a large part of US exports of services to China 

GNI (Gross National Income) is the current description of what used to be called GNP. It is GDP (Gross Domestic Product) plus net primary income from abroad (primary income receivable from the rest of the world less primary income payable to the rest of the world) Assuming this individual is a long-term resident (1 year or more) in Country B, than none of this counts as Country A's GNI (Gross National Income is the current description of what used to be called GNP). The earnings count in Country B's GDP (as part of the income measure) and GNI, while the remittance is part of Country A's secondary income from Country B and affects the Balance of Payments current accounts of the two countries. See chapter 12 of the IMF Balance of Payments manual. Something similar happens with the self-employed If however this individual is a short-term resident (less than a year) or a cross-border worker, employee compensation counts as primary income and so is part of Country A's GNI though Country B's GDP (as part of the income measure). Any goods or services this individual pays for in Country B is counted as a export from Country B to Country A. See chapter 11 of the IMF Balance of Payments manual. For short-term self-employed migrants, income counts as an export of services from Country B to Country A, and so counts in Country A's GDP and GNI, but again anything spent in Country B counts as trade the other way Measuring these flows and making these distinctions are difficult for national statistical services, especially for migrant workers who do not know how long they will be staying in another country 

Optimal allocation refers to whom the seller awards the item, in order to maximize revenue. In a Vickrey auction, it is a Nash equilibrium for everyone to bid their valuations. This is stronger than a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which is the solution concept in Bayesian games (which include auctions). The Bayesian Nash equilibrium is the solution concept in which every player seeks to maximize their expected utilities, subject to their respective beliefs about the world. In the Vickrey auction, agents' beliefs about the world do not really matter. The goal of the Vickrey auction is to illicit truthful responses from the agents. That is, they bid their precise valuations. The first-price auction is revenue-equivalent to the Vickrey auction; however, agents do not truthfully bid their valuations. In particular, if we have a symmetric $n$-player auction where players' valuations are drawn from a probability distribution $F([0, \omega])$ with density $f$, we have the expected revenue for the seller as: $$n \cdot \int_{0}^{\omega} (n-1) \cdot y \cdot f(y) \cdot F^{n-2}(y) \cdot (1-F(y)) dy$$ Combinatorially, we select the highest two bidders in $n(n-1)$ ways, since order matters. Suppose the second highest bid is $y$. This occurs with probability $f(y)$. The remaining $n-2$ players bid less than $y$ with probability $F^{n-2}(y)$. The highest bidder has valuation greater than $y$ with probability $1-F(y)$. Each of these selections are independent; so by rule of product, we multiply. As this is an expected value, we include $y$ in each product. By rule of sum, we add up over each possible value of $y$ (hence, the integral). 

What used to be called GNP is now called Gross National Income (GNI) as being more descriptive of what it is measuring. So GDP measures what is produced in a year while GNI measures incomes in a year, with the difference being some cross-border flows of money unrelated to exports and imports of goods and services. Personally I prefer GDP as it reflects what is happening in a country, but it depends on what you regard as vitality. 

Your article probably resulted from an Oxfam campaign If you believe table 2 of a January 2015 Oxfam report then about $\$250$ trillion. The campaign spliced together some information from Forbes on the richest $x$ individuals and a series of Credit Suisse reports - see the bottom of page 94 The analysis has faced criticism: it concentrates on individual assets and liabilities, e.g. a US doctor whose student debt exceeds personal financial assets counts as poorer than a subsistence farmer in Africa, and uses a very large amount of estimation, so other reasonable calculations could be very different 

The quotation comes from James Anderson and Eric Van Wincoop "Trade Costs" in the Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLII (September 2004) pp. 691–75 and a preprint of the article is available The calculation is trying to find the equivalent to an ad valorem tax by which the price of manufacture increases by the time of retail sale. Essentially it is saying transportation multiplies price by $1.21$ (a $21\%$ increase), tariff and non-tariff border related trade barriers multiply by $1.44$ (a $44\%$ increase), and retail and wholesale distribution costs multiply by $1.55$ (a $55\%$ increase) combining to multiply by $1.21\times 1.44\times 1.55=2.7$ (a $170\%$ increase). This figure being over $100\%$ is not an issue. For example you could imagine a high tax on a packet of bottle of perfume costing $\$10$ before tax: if the tax rate was $170\%$ ad valorem this would add $\$17$ tax and make the after-tax price $\$27$. There are plenty of caveats: domestic commerce also faces retail and wholesale distribution costs as well as some transport costs. Some goods see smaller costs, such as high-value low-weight goods seeing lower transport costs, or cross-border trade involving a short distance and a free-trade area, so this is in a sense a weighted average across goods and countries. The article goes into considerable detail on the methods used for the calculations and possible implications for trade models.
