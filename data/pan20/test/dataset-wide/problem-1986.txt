Those may or may not be symptoms that you are going to be terminated. However, if you feel uneasy about actions that are taken or not taken at work and how they affect your career, that is almost always a sign that you need to take action. You need to trust that little voice in your head that is giving you a warning. How would it harm you to try to fix the situation even if they were not planning to fire you? Talk to your boss privately. Express your concern that others are being assigned prohjects you had hoped to work on. Ask him what you can do to get these types of assignments. Specifically ask for work when you have none instead of relying on someone to give it to you. If your boss is noncommital about your future assignments or is unwilling to give you a task when there are clearly some that have not been assigned, then directly ask if he thinks you have a performance problem and if so what do you need to do to fix it. If you still feel uneasy after this conversation or if the suggestions for improvement are things that you strongly disagree with, then it might be time to start looking for a new job. If any suggestions are things you think are silly or mildly disagree with, then try them anyway. Your boss's perception of your performance is more critical to whether you are fired/promoted/stuck doing work you dislike than your perception. So if you want to stay, at least give the suggestions a fair shot. Even if it is too late at this place to make the correction, it is important to understand the problem before going to the next place or you will just have similar problems there. Or at the very least you will find out some of the things you need to be asking about the company culture when you interview for a new job. Learning to ask for constructive cricism, learning to hear it without getting defensive, and then acting on the criticism is a career-enhancing move. Sometimes the actions are to move to a differnt job because the differnce in expectations is just too great, but much of the time there are things that you can fix that will make this job work better for you and make your boss happier. Worry about whether you are getting fired is almost always unproductive. Taking actions to improve your work relationships with your boss are generally helpful evn if you don't have a perceived performance problem. What boss doesn't want to have employees who care about their preformance enough to ask what can be imporved and then work to improve it? Rememeber, it is highly unlikely you will be able to fix a problem that you don't know exists. When you are are uncertain that your work is being well received, then you need to find out what the problem is. 

First, I advise you to not quit the internship. You can make it through 2 more months. Mark the days on a calendar and cheerily check them all off. This place has a lot to teach you and none of it is about coding. You need to learn to navigate the workplace and learn to stick up for yourself. You need to learn that what is expected in terms of a project is what is expected and that there will be no slack given because you are an intern or a junior dev as far as things like deadlines. If others are telling you that you should not be in software development, be aware that may be a result of you being slower than they expected or it could simply be prejudice. Women in IT are often shoved into the specialites the men don't want to do. So don't let that make you lose confidence in yourself. Interns often face a difficulties in the workplace because they have not learned to work at a professional pace with deadlines and project managers and all the messy complexity of real life work. In school things are simplified. Almost all interns have culture shock on hitting the real world. Use the commute to study. Don't worry about time to talk to family or friends right now. They will still be there in 2 months. Talk to your manager about how you can improve. Listen to him and try to do what he asks. Yes I know he is a jerk, many managers are. But he is the only person you need to please at this job, so start learning skills on how to talk to your manager and how to adjust your way of working to what he wants. Have him help prioritize your workload. Then you know what to complete first. Tell the team members who tell you to move to QA that they can go take a hike. It is none of their business what you do with your career and you can ignore their petty behavior. You need to toughen up. The workplace is harsh. Listen to performance critiques and try to improve, but don't take things so personally. You are an intern, it is somewhat expected that you will not be perfect. So yes they will criticize to make your do better, but it doesn't mean there is anything wrong with your abilities that time and experience won't fix. Running away when things get tough, however is a very bad choice and it will affect your career greatly. Take heart - there are better places to work and you can find them in the future. But first get through this. You will be proud of yourself when you complete this internship. You need the experience to help get a job after you graduate. Failing to complete an internship will mean that you will have lower quality job opportunities when you graduate. Keep your eye on that prize instead of concentrating on the day-to-day. 

I have been the hiring offical and interviewed hundreds of people. I am never upset by someone appearing organized and well-prepared and having a list of questions you don't want to forget to ask appears organizaed and well-prepared to me. 

They asked everyone to take a 20% cut in pay to hire this guy, this should have been your first clue that he is there to save the company or because he is friends with the owners and anything he wants he will get. Your first move should have been to make friends with him. Since you chose to make him mad instead (and escalated that mad at least twice), there is little hope of salvaging the relationship now. The only possible way would be to grovel to the new guy to the point that almost anyone would find unacceptable. The guy is a jerk and will accept nothing less than servitude from you. For the future, if someone in a postion of authority (and anyone they cut your pay to hire is in authority over you no matter what the org chart might say) asks why you are late, explain that you have a medical condition (you don't need to disclose what) and that you have permission to be late as long as your make up the hours. Don't get mad, don't get snotty and don't say, "None of your business." I'm not saying he didn't act like a jerk. He did. I'm saying that he knows he can act like a jerk because right now he is the most imporatnt guy in the company. Personally I would not stay at a company that chose to cut my pay to hire someone else. This is clue that you are considered unimportant or that the company is in dire trouble. Anytime cutting your pay is on the table, looking for a new postion immediately is called for. 

If she is still an employee serving out her notice period, you need to decide if she can take it back depending on several factors: 

If you move to a job that you are not currently qualified for at the same level as the current job, then yes you might have to take a title cut or a salary cut to get the job. Why should I pay 100K (number chosen at random)for a senior person when I am hiring a trainee? Now you might not have to take as big a cut as someone who is truly right out of school as you have proven you can do programming work even if in another field. So if I would pay a senior 100K and a person right out of school 50K, then I might offer you 75K. Now that might be in line with your current salary if your current specialty pays less well than the one you are moving to. But it could depend on my budget, if I only have a budget for a trainee position, then you have less negotiating room. If I was planning to hire someone more senior but couldn;t find one I wanted, then I might offer you more knowing you will take longer to come up to seed than someone with experience. It might also incvolve if you are bringing something from your prior experience to the tabel that would offset you being a trainee like specific domain experience. As with any job change though, you need to balance what they are willing to pay you against what you need to have to pay your bills. If you can afford the cut and the job will take you where you want to go, then it is a possibility. Many people I know have done this to move to a more lucrative field. You can also negotiate a pay raise after X number of months after you have proven yourself. After all I would expect an experienced dev to get up to a more senior level in a new field faster than a new dev.
