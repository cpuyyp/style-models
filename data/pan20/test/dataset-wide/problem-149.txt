The pill costs \$1000 per six nights during which you can work all night. It's worth it from a financial point of view if you can earn more than \$167 per night of work. That's about \$21 per hour if you work 8 hours per night, which is just about the average hourly wage in the US. One can imagine quite a lot of people in a situation where this would indeed make sense, from someone running a business to someone earning a just-above-average wage who's working through the nights to earn a little bit extra to keep a family afloat. So basically there's going to be a possibly sizeable minority of people who take these pills on a regular basis and work both days and nights. I suspect that this would be pretty unpleasant for most people, but it's hard to say - maybe it's not too bad if the pill does a really good job of not making you feel drained or tired. Other people who can afford it might simply work normal hours and enjoy whatever activities they like at night time from time to time. (I would probably do this if I could.) Things get much more interesting if the pill is priced a bit lower. At half the price people on low wages can earn more by taking it constantly, and those are the people most likely to need the extra money. This would lead to a world that I don't think I would like very much. If lots of people are working 100+ hours a week and earning more money then supply and demand will mean that the cost of living goes up. Thus for more and more people, it will be impossible to get by without doing so. Taking the pills and working all night would be essentially compulsory - it would just be the new normal. It's worth noting that in this scenario the company making the pills will sell an awful lot more of them - so if these pills existed I would expect this version to be what actually happens. 

In principle, yes. The formose reaction starts with formaldehyde (a simple molecule consisting of one carbon atom, one oxygen and two hydrogens) and produces an array of different sugars. Unfortunately the result is poisonous to eat, both because not all sugars are edible and possibly also because it still contains some formaldehyde, which is fairly nasty stuff by itself. However, with sufficient investment in chemical techniques this could probably be tamed to produce only a specific type of sugar, which could then by used as a starting point to synthesise more complex food molecules, such as larger carbohydrates, fatty acids and proteins. Again this assumes considerable investment in chemical expertise, but it's not far beyond what's achievable even with present technology, if there were sufficient reason to perfect it and make it safe. However, it may well be that it's cheaper and easier to just use bacteria instead. After all, a bacterium is already a machine that can break down existing organic material into its basic constituents and then (with the help of some energy) build them back up again into sugars, fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Doing all this chemically would be very expensive and it may well be hard to beat 4 billion years of evolution in terms of efficiency. (Though for the sake of a story, it's not completely implausible that you could.) 

One thought that comes to mind is this: imagine that the planet isn't quite fully tidally locked but instead rotates very slowly.* Therefore on one side of the planet the Sun is always setting, but so slowly it hardly moves over a human lifetime, and on the other side it's rising. On the setting side there are (or once were) lush forests of normal Earth-like trees. Eventually the Sun goes down and those trees are cast into darkness, which kills them due to lack of photosynthesis --- but before they can fully decay they become encased in ice, where they remain for (let's say) hundreds of thousands of years as they pass around the dark side of the planet. Your civilisation lives on the opposite side of the planet, where the Sun is rising. Those dead trees, encased in ice for thousands of years, are now nearing the sunlit side once again. It's still dark where they are, but warm air currents from the sunlit side have begun to melt the ice. Thus, the ground is covered in freshly uncovered and well-preserved dead plant matter, the perfect environment for fungi to grow. It's cold, so they grow slowly. (Otherwise they would just use it all up too quickly to reach any appreciable size.) Since there is always new dead forest emerging from the ice the ecosystem is stable and many species, including the giant mushrooms, have evolved to fit this unusual niche. *Full disclosure: this might not matter if you're not worried about 100% plausibility, and I'm not 100% sure about the following anyway, but this situation might be quite difficult to achieve from an orbital mechanics point of view. When a planet becomes tidally locked it probably doesn't just rotate more and more slowly but instead starts rocking from side to side like a pendulum until it comes to a stop. However, it might be possible to achieve a very slowly rotating planet if it's influenced by the gravity of another body, such as a small or distant moon, or a second sun/brown dwarf/black hole etc. 

You say that the emperor wouldn't assign governorships to guild leaders because that would weaken his power. But to me it looks like the guild leaders aren't necessarily his biggest worry: it is the regional governors who have the armies, and perhaps it is only a matter of time before one of them decides to advance on the capital and take the Imperial throne for themselves. What to do? Well, the guild leaders are also powerful, but they are a little more under the emperor's direct control. He can always re-appoint them after all, at least on paper, and a guild leader has much less motivation to storm the imperial palace than the regional governors. Perhaps by shifting the balance of power towards them the Emperor can safeguard his family's future. He knows that this will give the guild leaders much more power than his family, but it's still the best option. They'll become figureheads, but it's better to be alive figureheads than dead despots. So, by a series of crafty interventions - an increase in funding here, a surprise reassignment of the governorship there - the emperor builds a stable society in which power is divided along the lines of the guilds' specialisations. The regional states are no longer a threat, and while the emperor's family have given up the power they once wielded, they are not only get to live but even get to keep the palace. Of course you have to play around with the details to make this convincing, but the point is that if the emperor sees that his power is inevitably waning he might not desperately try to hold onto it, but might willingly choose to give the guild leaders power if that helps him avoid a worse fate. 

I'm assuming you're talking about the classic heat death, rather than any of the other theories that have come about from time to time (such as the "big rip"). In this case, to all practical purposes, the post-heat-death Universe would be not much different from the vacuum of space as it exists today. The main differences would be (i) there would be no starlight or light or matter of any kind, and (ii) there would be no detectable cosmic microwave background radiation, or indeed any detectable radiation of any kind. All the radiation is actually still there, it's just that the Universe has expanded a lot since today, and the radiation has expanded along with it, converting it to such enormous wavelengths and low intensities that it could never possibly be detected. The matter, on the other hand, really isn't there any more. It was all converted into black holes very long ago, which then evaporated into electromagnetic radiation over trillions upon trillions of years; that radiation has since been stretched out along with all the other radiation. So the universe they find will be black - completely and utterly black beyond all conception of blackness, and cold - completely and utterly cold beyond all conception of coldness. But since space is already pretty cold and black in our time, the space suits we already have would be perfectly good for surviving in it for a time. As for the effect the astronauts will have on the universe: well, they're emitting a lot of infra-red radiation, along with their radio signals and any visible light from lamps they have with them. That radiation will spread out from their position at the speed of light, and keep going pretty much forever, though in the general scheme of things it won't be all that long before it too is stretched out to undetectably long wavelengths and to all practical purposes disappears. They are also very likely to leave behind them some atoms even if they make it back somehow, due to gas leaks, propellant, dust particles and what have you. In the absence of any black holes those atoms will last for quite some time, but they will probably eventually decay to electromagnetic radiation through some process or other. Though if they happen to have left a net charge there might be a few electrons left over, which can never decay because there are no protons left in the entirety of the rest of the Universe. It's a tiny mark to leave on the Universe, but it will last for all eternity. 

Yes, it's extremely easy, just grind stuff. Or even don't bother grinding stuff, just let the millstones scrape against each other with nothing in between them. This will convert the kinetic energy into heat. But wait, you might say (and indeed do say in the comments), surely this isn't the most efficient way to do it. But in fact it is! The reason is that the only thing stopping the blades from spinning faster and faster and faster in the first place is friction. All of the kinetic energy in the blades gets converted to heat through friction. Some of that friction is in the air outside (you can't do anything about that) but the rest is friction in the millstones and in the gears, shafts etc. in the machinery. All of that's inside the mill already, so just running the mill as usual is an absolutely 100% efficient way to generate heat. You'll have to make sure the mill is well insulated, though, which could be a bit of an issue in a lightweight moving structure that's not designed for it. There is a better way, though. Better than 100? Yes, actually! By using the energy to run a Stirling engine or some other kind of heat pump to pump heat from outside the mill to the inside, you can get 100% of the kinetic energy (which still turns into heat from friction), plus a bit extra that you can pump in. There is a limit to how much extra you can get of course, but for a heat pump system efficiencies of somewhat more than 100% really are possible. (This is not a violation of thermodynamics and can't be used to generate free energy, before someone gets the wrong idea. It's actually a pretty commonplace way to heat buildings.) Is any of this actually possible? Well, it says here that a traditional windmill can put out 14kW of mechanical energy, which is more than enough to heat a home, so you probably don't need to worry about the heat pump system. So if you can solve the insulation problem just run the mill normally and you will be nice and warm. 

Start a lottery company. To enter this lottery, you pay \$1, and the prize money is some amount that's sufficiently small not to imbalance the economy, say \$10,000. There is one winner per day. You buy the ticket online, and when you do so you have to check a box saying that you agree to the terms and conditions. These include the phrase "I wish to win \$10,000." Then your job is simply to get up in the morning, look at the name of the randomly selected winner, and say "so be it." Since the winnings are generated by magic, your company doesn't actually have to pay them out, and thus you will make a nice profit. Of course there are issues with how to set such a company up, whether it's legal, whether you'd be found out if it is, and what to do if the server goes down or if no-one buys a ticket - but if you have someone willing to wish these problems away in exchange for a share of the profits then they are hardly problems at all. 

The most obvious, and perhaps the most satisfying way to do this is to give the planet two suns - one that provides light and one that provides heat. The problem is, how do you get one sun to appear only when the other does not? Some other answers have suggested that the planet could orbit close to a brown dwarf (or hot gas giant, which is essentially the same thing), while the brown dwarf itself orbits a much more distant blue giant star. The brown dwarf would loom large in the sky as a dull red disk, warming the planet like a giant electric heater but not providing much light, whereas the blue giant, being so far away, would appear as a small but very very bright point of bluish white light, providing not much in the way of heat. (It actually gives out a lot more heat than the brown dwarf, but not so much of that reaches the planet since it's so far away. A substantial amount of light does reach the planet because blue giants are really, really hot and therefore give out an insane amount of light in comparison to the huge amount of heat they also give out.) The problem is that as the planet orbits the brown dwarf the location of the two stars in the sky will change. Sometimes the planet will be between its two stars, so that one rises as the other sets, and then the days will be cold and the nights warm. But after the planet has progressed halfway around its orbit of the brown dwarf, the two stars will be near each other in the sky, and they'll rise and set at more or less the same time, just like on Tattooine. (Except that one star appears much bigger than the other in the sky.) Sometimes the 'day' star might even get eclipsed by the 'night' one. Depending on the orbital period of the planet around its brown dwarf, these seasons might cycle every week or so, or it might be a few years. It's worth noting also that as well as giving out its own dull red light, the brown dwarf will reflect light from the blue giant, so it will have phases like Earth's moon, being 'full' when the stars are on opposite sides of the sky, and waning to a crescent and then a 'new sun' as they approach the same side. The unlit part will appear red and the lit part might be white, or it might be coloured, depending on what chemical processes are occurring in the upper layers of its atmosphere. (See the gas giants in our Solar system for examples of what this colouring might be like.) This is all quite interesting, but what if you want the nights to always be hotter than the days, and not just sometimes? I can think of a couple of ways that might work, depending on what you want. One way is to make the seasons change really slowly. If you make the "night" sun a red giant rather than a brown dwarf then you can put the planet really far away from it, because red giants are really really big and put out a huge amount of heat. Being far away means a slow orbital period. If the Sun became a red giant then the planets in the outer Solar system would receive enough heat to have liquid water, so you could make the orbital period a few hundred years. By giving the star a larger mass you could make it longer still. In this situation, the nights will be hotter than the days, but it would have been the other way around a few hundred years ago, and people might have legends about that. The other way is to put your planet at what's called the "L1 Lagrange point" between the two stars. That's the point where their gravity exactly cancels out, so the planet can sit between them (but closer to the smaller one) without orbiting at all. This sounds ideal, except that the L1 point is a so-called "unstable equilibrium." Staying in that point is a bit like balancing on the top of a really tall poll - it doesn't take a lot of energy, but unless you keep shifting your weight in just the right way you'll fall down and end up somewhere else. This means your planet won't stay in that position by itself, but depending on what propulsion technology your world has, it might be possible to keep it there technologically. If you're looking for a high-tech solution, this might be it.
