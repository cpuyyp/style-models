I think such sentences do not really favorably impress any customer, and would never tell them right in front of them. How can I address the issue to this senior colleague? 

You don't need to go deep in details about how obnoxious your office population is. Stay high level and mention that there was no matching between your needs/expectations and what the company could offer. If they ask further, you could mention what was missing for you (i.e. team spirit). In any case be sure to mention what you were looking for, and not only what they lacked in: you will convey the message that you have clear targets/ambitions. 

Unless you have sent an empty CV with an empty motivation letter and yet they hired you (which means they didn't bother reading your documents), I think their behavior is pretty normal. If you have questions about the company, just ask them and try to get a better idea on the company itself. 

The answer to this strongly depends on what is the general approach to "process adherence" within the company, and you should have already a feeling about this. I have worked in a company which was, on paper, certified ISO9001, but the CEO always bugged us with quotation requests made by quick and incomplete phone calls, though we had a request form where all the info could be collected. You probably guess that in that case enforcing standard was a lost battle. You have two alternatives: 

I assume your employer doesn't pay your salary to have you do this kind of stuff. First you can try setting up a meeting with your manager to discuss about your performance so far, and see how your work is seen in the company. There you can also address the lack of communication and challenge you feel. At least you should be able to tell if the lack of interaction with the manager is due to the manager's style or to a genuine lack of interest in the project itself. Then, if you want to grow further, and this project doesn't seem to fit your ambition and skills, you can consider switching to another job, either in the same company or somewhere else. 

I think it is sort of gray area, and being you the only one present when it happened makes it even more gray. What I mean is that yes, a library is a public place, but in that very moment you were the only one present, and probably the coworker assumed it was not a big deal. It would have been probably better to address the issue there on the spot, just by asking "hey XXX, I get this is a back work area, but why don't you use the changing room or the restroom to change your clothes? Now we are the only two, but others may come at any moment". 

While it is understandable that you feel betrayed by this behavior, be aware that it also tells you what is your better course of action: they cannot afford you to be away for 4 weeks? Find another job and be gone for more than 4 weeks! (and stitch to the minimum notice when giving the news to them) You say you have several years experience, so you won't start from the bottom of the ladder when job searching. It really doesn't matter if they have done this to force you to leave or because they really can't afford you to be gone: they admittedly changed the rules to prevent you from having benefit from them. From their point of you view if you just swallow it without any reaction, it just set the threshold for how much you can be squeezed a tad further. 

Business people should know that agendas are living creatures constantly changing, so don't overthink it. 

It is safe to assume the interview was not successful and move on. Unless you want to have their feedback on your interview so that you can improve your interviewing, you can avoid contacting them. Sending rejection mail it's not the top priority of recruiters and interviewers, so it can happen that they drop that activity if they have other priorities to attend. Just as anecdote, I once interviewed for a company and the interview ended with a common "we will let you know". After a couple of weeks of not earing back from them, I took the interview for not successful. They got back to me after 1 and half year (!!!) stating that they wanted to hire me. I politely declined their offer stating I had found a job since the interview took place and was no longer interested. 

In this way you also allow people to be able to counter your objection, because if they are expert they also know the science behind your objection. 

You can tell the truth without badmouthing the company: just state that you realized there was no match between what the organization wanted and your personal drivers and experience. I don't think interviewers want to listen to a detailed story on what went wrong with the old company, they are interested in understanding your fit within their company. 

Your potential employer is very likely interested in having you correctly completing the assigned tasks in a given time. That you already knew how to handle it or that you searched for help it has little impact on the outcome, as long as you can be on schedule. Someone said that knowledge is not about keeping all the information in your head, but knowing where to find it when it is needed. This is the very case. 

I would simply talk with the supervisor and ask if it is ok to skip lunch break and then leave 1 hour earlier. If that is not possible, you may consider starting earlier so that you clock your 8 hours (plus lunch break) in time before the external appointment. 

I have been in your same situation: working for a company (on paper) certified ISO9001, where the owner requested quotes by phone with a simple "I am going to meet a potential customer, make a quotation for a PV plant to be built on a normal industrial building", ignoring the standard forms we had in place, and then complaining that the quote was wrong because the curved roof was not considered in the design. Run as fast as you can, save your energies for more worthy battles! This person is the boss, and trying to convince him that he is wrong would only cast a negative light on you, because "you cannot understand what he means!" 

The more the manager sees you on the job, the more likely it is that he/she will form an informed opinion on you as a potential employee, and thus for you to get a positive reference 

The fact that you are in a short term contract is known. Informing that you are looking for other opportunities is kinda stating the obvious. 

Background info: Some years ago when I was job hunting I applied for a position advertised by an agency. The position was on the edge of the space where I could be a good fit, and I was rejected. Few months afterwards the same agency advertised another position for which my profile would have been a perfect fit, and I applied. The recruiter first contacted me to schedule an interview and asked me to provide some material formatted according to the agency standard. When I pointed him to the material I had already provided for the previous application, he wanted to cancel the interview as "I see now you have already been rejected by us". I objected that the positions where considerably different and that I felt to be a better fit for the present one. The recruiter replied in a confronting way, and challenged me to send an impressive motivation letter for the position in half an hour, then if he was convinced he might change his mind. I sent the motivation letter and was scheduled an interview with the agency shortly after. When I went to the interview I found out it was staged by this recruiter just as a practice session for a new hire of his agency to practice his interviewing skills. Then they communicated me I was rejected for not fitting the position. Since the recruiter had slipped the name of the company in our mail exchange, I decided to apply directly to the company: I was called for an interview by them and was told I was their second best candidate for the position. Question Few months ago the recruiter of the agency, through common contacts, has made a cold try to get me to work for his agency. I know I will be meeting him in person soon for a non work related event, and I am pretty sure he will make a direct attempt again. How can I professionally tell him that I have no interest in working for an agency that, through his behavior, made me feel just like cannon fodder? 

You have come in touch with one of the most touchy subjects in office environments: the office temperature! Being on the hot side myself (my comfort zone is around 18-20 degree Celsius), I understand the topic. What I did when I had to face the issue was: I tried lightening my clothes as much as the office dress code allowed, and then if that was not enough I engaged the "cold" person making visible that I could not be less dressed than that, asking if he/she could do something to help me, too. You can also try seating the cold person away from the window, so that when it is slightly opened the disturbance will be minimized. 

This is the situation: some customer's representatives came to visit us and run some test on the product they use at our factory. A small team is assigned to stay with them run the test. During the test a senior colleague belonging to the host team starts telling things like: 

Tell the supervisor that such comments on your appearance/dress are not appreciated. If the behavior doesn't stop, report to the supervisor's manager and/or HR 

Your colleague smokes outside and never inside, so she is doing her best to don't bother her colleagues with her habit and to obey the law. I think that, before pushing her to change, you could ask for an air purifier to be installed in your office, too, as you have already made clear that you are allergic to smoke. On her side, she could start wearing a smoking jacket when she takes her break, so that the smoke would not stitch on her office clothes, reducing the polluting load she takes inside. But, being this not prescribed by any law or regulation, it may be harder to enforce.
