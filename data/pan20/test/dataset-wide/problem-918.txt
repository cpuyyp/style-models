If this is a scrap of papyrus in no way connected to the image above, on what basis do they include it in the poem of the two images above? 

In Sappho 94 (τεθνάκην δ' ἀδόλως θέλω), there is this tercet at ll. 25-27, which is very incomplete, which Edmonds doesn't even have, and which Bibliotheca Augustana and Campbell p. 69 both read: 

Update Diehl p. 49 also has an incomplete (in fact, even more incomplete than the others) version. Can't get ahold of Bergk, but seen as this doesn't give the Bergk number for this poem, Bergk probably didn't have the poem at all. Voigt is also either to be paid for, a Google Book, or on researchgate which I'd have to join for something which is not my field of study, which feels like lying. 

In a relatively short while, I'll have to write a blog post on this poem, so I've been doing some research into the sources. The first is P.Oxy. 1232, an image of which is the following. 

From these, I can find most of what the text at Greek Wikisource (very end of page) has. However, there is a bit that is not in these images. From what I see on Grenfell and Hunt's book on the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (HUGE DOCUMENT, Firefox crashed while I tried to find the page of the below image), P.Oxy.1232 is supposed to have a couple other fragments, one of which they transcribe as: 

Additionally, the cultural context also supports this. Anyone who grew up in USSR would immediately assume that "И потом вам вернут!" has State Security connotations as the first option. 

He discusses being afraid He persists in using anonymous 3rd tense - the unmentioned they are the ones who hold him in his power (implying of course Don Reba's people) - the same implied they in the sentence the question bolded. 

Eric Flint is fairly outspoken about his political views (in bumper sticker terms, he's a self-proclaimed socialist, although - as is the case with most real humans - it's a bit more nuanced than that once you dig into details). Did Flint ever elaborate on how his political outlook reflected in his works, especially 1632/Ring of Fire series? I'm looking specifically for Flint's self-assessment in this question. 

The subsequent text pretty clearly provides the context; and it's the one you suggested ("after they kill me for possessing it") 

Yet, in the last chapter 12, it indicates that the death faking indeed happen, but I don't think it was described how. All we see is that Victor is worried about being recognized, which would destroy his plan to be assumed to be dead: 

He clearly has some knowledge of engineering as a field of occupation. Upon finding a broken phone with Dagny, he is able to evaluate if the wiring and determine that the current is on. Not exactly rocket surgery, but also not what an average non-technical "manager" is able to do. 

I think we can reasonably infer that the work Lewis is referring to is The Works of Aristotle the Famous Philosopher, which, per Wikipedia, is a sex manual and book of midwifery, falsely claiming to be the work of Aristotle. In other words, a work of pretentious smut. Just the sort of thing that Lewis liked to rail against. So, the answer is: Smutty bookshops. 

The Puritans regarded themselves as representing a purified Christianity and hoped to establish a Christian society free of the corrupting influence of the old world. In doing so, he argues, they take on an exceptional responsibility: the reputation of God and his people throughout the world: 

The later doctrine of American exceptionalism seems to be a secularization of this idea: an exceptionalism based on civic virtues and the constitution rather than on love and grace. Modern liberalism generally is basically a secularized version of Christianity. 

He is therefore telling them that they are to be a light to the world. Edit: The exceptionalism here is not American exceptionalism (there was not America at the time), it is Christian exceptionalism. 

This, allowing for certain changes in rhetorical style over the years, could be Bernie Sanders. Except Bernie Sander would not likely quote Deuteronomy in support of this assertion. 

The previous stanzas make it clear that, despite the traveller's hesitation, there really was nothing to choose between the roads. It is a meaningless choice and its consequences cannot be known because "way leads on to way" and he is probably not going to have the chance to go back and explore the other path. But that is not how he is going to tell the story later in life. Later he is going to make the decision seem more bold and adventurous than it really was, and is going to claim that this bold choice made all the difference in his life. The final, and most famous, lines, therefore, are a piece of humbug: 

Closer to the end of the book, Sheymov's contact from CIA refused to go with his plan to fake their family death when defecting. In Chapter 11, "Misha" refuses to help with the plan: 

One of the most striking things about Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson was the fact that the novel's text was full of mathematical formulas. In some ways, this approach resembles, for example, inclusion of in-depth military technology porn in Clancy-esque technothrillers. But mathematical formulas seem to take this "professional knowledge" approach to a wholly separate level. Is there a tradition of including actual formulas in fiction books that deal with mathematically inclined characters and events and subjects? Or was Stephenson's work groundbreaking in that respect? 

There's no other information on Kellogg available in the book to clarify his specialty aside from him attending Galt's class on physics. 

True leaders/geniuses. Rearden. Sanders. Daniels Those that would undermine Taggart T company. It's an interesting question about "why", but he was pretty happy about grabbing people who aren't shown to be extra genius such as Owen Kellogg and McNamara - merely very competent. The main quality outside competence seems to be "undermine Taggart despite Dagny's effort" - at the moment, she represented the opposite force to Galt, he wanted to break the old society and she was working with all her abilities to keep it alive. As such, including Owen Kellogg and McNamara may be for the same exact reason: they are ex-connected to Taggart. This kills two birds with one stone: 

My father was a professor of literature and I am reasonably confident that if he were asked this question he would say that the purpose of criticism is not to figure out what the author meant, but to fully understand and appreciate the nature of the experience that the work creates. He spent much of his career arguing for the superiority of the 1850 version of Wordsworth's prelude over the 1805. The 1805 version is considerably more liberal in its sentiments and it was preferred by many of the scholars of the day for that reason -- they considered it to be a better work because it expressed more liberal sentiments compared to the more conservative sentiments of the 1850 version. But my father's argument was not that the 1850 version was better because its politics were more conservative, but that it was better because it was better poetry; that its images were more striking and its emotions both more mature and more deeply felt. (I'm paraphrasing his argument wildly, but that seems to me, through the filter of memory, to be the gist of it.) I also remember an anecdote about Beethoven which I assume I must have heard from him. A woman came up to Beethoven after a concert and asked him what the piece he had just played meant. Beethoven answered by sitting down at the piano and playing it again. A piece of art, in other words, means itself, the totality of its experience, and nothing else. The purpose of criticism is both to judge the quality of the experience as an experience and to make the fullness of the experience more accessible to the reader. Of course, this is not the majority view among literary critics. But to me, the notion of a piece of literature as a covert polemic seems odious. I believe that a writer turns to fiction not to conceal an argument which they are very capable of making plainly, but to record an experience. Sometimes, in other words, what you want to say is not that the world should be such and such, but simply that the world is such and such, not how human life should be lived, but simply what the nature of human experience actually is. Experience, by its nature, cannot be conveyed in summary. It can only be taken whole. The meaning of a poem is the poem. The meaning of a novel is the novel. 

It seems that Earth has very little trouble placing its people into extremely high positions all over in a variety of countries and societies, despite not having mind control technology - or for that matter, much of any useful technology for infiltration (they can't spy remotely, for example, requiring Rumata to be physically present to record stuff with his Google Glass headband camera). They have their unlimited synthesized gold, but I doubt you can just buy high nobility that easily. Don Rumata's singular case can be explained - he's a "foreign noble", in a distant province, and he assumed the identity of an actual dead noble. (and even so, Don Reba tumbled on to his cover story pretty easily, by checking that real Don Rumata of Estor is dead for several years). How did the rest of them manage this feat? Don Kondor is far higher placed than Rumata, in Republic of Soan. The text mentions several others by name, and the implication seems to be that there are dozens if not hundreds all over. 

So, what exactly did they do to pretend to be dead if the plan with the rowboat was rejected as it needed help from Americans? 

The significance in-universe is that they are literally escaping California (and thus heading East). The significance out of universe is - presumably - as you noted, that it is the reverse of the original. During Oregon Trail days, you traveled West to obtain maximum freedom and opportunity. During the events when Comet got stuck, California became the land of un-freedom and tyranny, with the mid-west being the only free option to escape.
