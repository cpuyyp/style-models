For me I do not bill in less than 15 minute increments. Just a quick email takes up 15 minutes of your day. I go with if it is less than 30 minutes or less then I round down and more than 30 minutes I round up. So two quick emails would be free but 3, 4, 5 or 6 would be billed at 1 hour. Or you could go with a policy of round up at 30 minutes. As for warranty you need to deal with that in the contract. Also if the email could help lead to more business then I am more inclined to not bill. If the email is from someone not authorized to approve the billing (invoice) then cc the person that is authorized to approve the invoice. 

If you are only a few months in I see no harm in asking. It is an option they had put on the table. I don't think a reasonable HR or boss should be offended or consider you a flight risk because you asked. That said they may very well say no. If so don't argue. They may want the liquidity as much as you do. 

Don't talk about the software process. It is frustrating to me when customers think they can design better than I can. They will skip functional requirements and go straight to functional design. You get some users that are just not capable of a functional requirement - it is too abstract for them. Try to get them to talk about the requirements. 

Easily converse in English is not easier. Find out the chain policy on language. Then talk to her supervisor. Even if there is a policy that has not been enforced she should get permission to enforce the policy. If it is OK with her supervisor I guess she could order English only but it might not be well received. If other supervisors don't order English only then it will likely not be well received. 

You will need to also convince the customer the design path is wrong and you cannot pull rank on them. You will need to admit to the customer a poor design was presented. If you pull rank on your team they are not going to be very supportive in convincing the customer the design path is wrong. Maybe start over is the correct long term design you just need to be aware of the social challenges involved. You need to start calling it a limited (not wrong) design path. 

You were probably a candidate for the position but unfortunately not the top candidate. In the Fall probably means after they know what positions are open. Definitely follow up. 

Absolutely apply. It is the CV that will be on file so make it a good one. In your cover letter maybe even state your situation - you need a job to stay in the US. They may low ball you but a job is a job. Recruiters may ignore you as they want quick paycheck. Apply directly with companies. With a PhD you probably have limited target group. 5-6 months out if they are looking for a PhD in your field will get their attention. 

I think you have yourself worked up over something you have no control over. This is the owner. He gets to hire and fire who he wants. Conflict of interest? Uh, no. Even if his friend does not perform and he keeps him on that is not a conflict of interest. You seem to have difficultly with the concept of owner. So what if there is an ulterior motive? As long as it is legal the owner gets to do what he wants. 

It would depend a lot on the type of surgery. I tore a rotator cuff and what I did was use a gaming mouse and mouse pad and turn up the sensitivity. It was still painful. For part of the day I would just use my left hand only and turn the sensitivity down. A touch pad was even worse for me. Getting up and shuffle papers is hard even using the other hand as the arm swings. He should ask his Dr. A roller ball may work. It will be very dependent on the type of surgery. 

Snitches get stitches. He clearly told you in confidence as a courtesy so that you could personally prepare. He might not leave and if you say anything it will compromise his career. In the future you will need to work with other employees and they will know you compromised a person's career. If him leaving means it will impact the project then he is contributing. Your concerns for the project do not trump a mans career nor what he shared in confidence. If he was withholding information to intentionally make a maximum negative impact and it slipped that he was DEFINITELY leaving then maybe. Sounds like he shared what he considered confidential information in good faith. 

That is a good one. My interpretation is you can use what you learn at work. And when not at work. Is this even "at work"? It would only be proprietary if it about a proprietary process or product. Clearly if this is general training then it is not about something proprietary to the business. Most companies have policy cannot use company time or resources. This is not company time. I would not call it direct use of the resource. You trained then built. If this was not a group license and the company was billed incrementally for the class then I would say you used company resources. I get some people may consider this direct use of a company resource and I can agree with that. 

I don't think you need an excuse to shut your screen. There are many legitimate private matters. On old trick is called boss mode where you have a screen saver that looks like a regular screen. Learn the keys to put it in screen saver mode quickly. 

If he cannot write up 5 pages in 2 hours then he did not know what the requirements were in the first place. 

If you have a lot of well written accepted answers in a skill they want that is a good thing. If you have questions and answers with a lot of down votes then that is a bad thing. Questions and answer poorly written is a negative. 

Agency can ask a lot of things. Up to you to decide if you are going to reply. You should have some kind of record of when the first resume was received. If you simply reply we already received a resume for that candidate on yy-mm-dd then hopefully that is enough. If the recruiter demands proof and which agency then you need to decide the relationship with that recruiter. The agreement between the applicant and the recruiter is between the applicant and the recruiter. 

As for your items all they can do is tell you they reviewed CCTV and found nothing. Any reasonable company is going to take theft very seriously. If personal items are stolen then company items and company data are also at risk. Don't expect them to issue a memo here is what we have done to beef up security as the thieves can use that to elude security. If they catch the thieves they might not even tell you. A memo warning employees of thefts and guideline for how to secure items or not leave items at work is appropriate. 

As a manager how you introduce it makes a big difference. Are you asking because you think it is wrong. If so that will come out and the are likely to get defensive. If you really want to know about a design decision then ask in an open way. 

The safe best to take the take the time off. In two states I have received $0 for unused vacation days. Unless the contract states an equivalent value for vacation days then it has no value. And they could let you go early so they don't have to pay holidays. Let's say you have 2 weeks of vacation. Tell them you are giving a 2 weeks notice and taking a two week vacation. Tell them if they want to pay you out on the PTO you would actually rather work. Turn in the vacation request first. Worse case scenario is they fire you immediately and claim a PTO has no cash value. You turned in the vacation request before you were fired. 

So another perspective and yes I am clearly a techy Managers go the meetings and manage that is what they do. They often view the time of a high end techy as no more than a secretary. 2 hours out of the day of a developer is a lot. Cleary bring a book is not the way to handle it. Bring code or go over your project schedule. They are paying you - conform even if you don't agree. I get petty requests from managers that want to manager for the sake of manage all time and just suck it up and do it. I will explain to them a couple times why I don't think it is a good idea. If they want to listen they will. If they don't want to listen they won't. Do what they ask even if you don't agree. You manipulate them with seeds so they come back with their idea but I don't have the patience for that. If you feel what they asked for something that could cause some problems down the road then document them politely. You don't want to get blamed for the consequences of a task you don't agree with. "Made the change X and did testing Y - be aware the down the line the potential impact is Z." Where I get this a lot is scale. When the app is small you can do a lot of stuff. An app that is going to get big have to potentially have to scale out to like a farm you need to design for that. If they say they don't care I want it then say fine. But when the day comes for scaling it out and that task is huge give them a list of changes you did not agree with that made the task hard. Don't leave because a manager does not respect your time. It is not a battle - it is a way of life. A really good manager that respects your time is a gift and they are going get promoted. A shitty manager you are stuck with. Suck it up. Move to another job for a better opportunity but don't expect better managers. 

Even if you don't get fired you will go to the bottom of the list for training, long project, and promotion. You are announcing you don't intend to stay. An idea. Tell them: 

Let's turn it around. A customer of you had not paid for 120 day. Boss told you to cut off service. You tell customer they are cut off. Do want to hear why or sorry? No! It is the customer's problem to clear their account accounts receivable. Does the guy cutting off your power for non-payment want to hear why you can't pay the bill or your apology. 

It is painfully obvious why you did not know tasks were pending. He got mad the last time you bugged him about this. You think bugging him again is going to help? Keep your head down and do your tasks. 

On the surface this is just so silly I don't think logic will prevail. Why have the same code standards for for two different languages? Why would you need to copy a project from one to the other anyway? Is this a battle you want to take on? How many developers? Are they all willing to go to management and say this is silly. Even if you win your relationship with you lead will be damaged. If you lose you may lose your job. Try to get the whole team in meeting with your boss (if he will support it). 

In theory it is salted so IT cannot see it and you should not need to share with others but stuff happens. What if you cannot get into work and someone needs on you computer. Why take the risk? Incorrect password attempts do often get logged. I missed my password twice and typed in a swear string out of frustration and I got talked to about it. 

Sound like the organization is bad from top to bottom. I just don't see how telling them they are bad would help. If they were competent it would not be that bad in the first place. If works are being purchased and you get proof there is probably some whistle blower organization you could report to. But you need hard evidence. Looking for hard evidence may get you fired. The best step may be to look for another job or just do the task they want you to do in the current job. This is the type of job that is easier if you don't care. 

How important and well performed are not the same. Yes skip may have been aware of the importance of your work. He got exposure to the specifics of your work and he is not impressed. That is not good news. Ask your manager what he thinks was lacking in your reports. Work on improving your performance in general. At this point I don't think you want more visibility with skip. It is odd that you would be working for skip for 3 months and not received any negative feedback directly. If he feels your work is not up to par and did not share that with you then he does not even consider you an asset worth developing. 

This is more about code practices than business priorities. I am a programmer and a bit set in my ways but this programmer is off the grid. I don't get why anyone would take style over speed. ORM are convenient but not efficient. It is not bad style to use SQL. It is not bad style to denormalize a database for performance. Premature optimization is a bad code practice but optimize bottlenecks is a good code practice. I will review any query that takes over 2 seconds. My pet peeve is custom controls. The business will ask for a very specific look and I will responde but the standard control presents the information. Standard controls are fast and tested. When we upgrade we don't need to coordinate multiple libraries. Why would any programmer want to use a ORM that takes 4 hours to run? It would take 4 hours to test. If the programmer was fighting to go SQL to shave 4 seconds off an 8 second query and the business said 8 seconds is good enough we want to stay ORM for maintainability then I would get that debate. As for how to convince the programmer? I would call it more a code practices issue than business priorities. A business does not need justify that a 30 second search is better than a 4 hour search. I only do ORM because writing raw SQL is a bad practice is just plain not an acceptable. If the language and the platform supports raw SQL then it is acceptable. The programmer needs to be put on a corrective action program and HR needs to be involved. If you are not his boss then go to his boss. 

No matter when you have this discussion it will be before the next bonus. This is an appropriate discussion for your annual review. I suggest you not try and manipulate timing. If bonus is also tied to profit and this is a high profit year then maybe delay to a lower profit year. If you are really concerned about the possibility of growth then you need to have that discussion now. Decide to push on salary or not based on that discussion. For the company they review your performance for the bonus so it is natural to have performance discussions in the same time frame. Go with the flow. 

You seem too concerned with what he knows or not and his behavior. He is a performance tester. Load him up with tests and report his performance. Put the request in writing and demand a report in writing. 

There are two ethics questions here. Is it ethical work (do homework). Not ethical but also not illegal. Is it ethical to misrepresent the work (do homework) as tutoring on a resume. Yes it is unethical as tutor is teach. It would be ethical to represent the work as do homework but most employers would not value that experience. If you just list the projects on your portfolio they will quickly look like homework and when they ask who they were for you pretty much have to tell them a student. You could get a away with listing maybe a couple pet (no customer) projects. If you just call yourself a tutor you could list the subjects you tutored in. Not really ethical but you are not likely to get found out.
