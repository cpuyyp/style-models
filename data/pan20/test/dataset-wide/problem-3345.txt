Function words as "he/she/it" can't be there from the beginning. They have to be developed. And the normal way is using the demonstratve adjective + nouns as man/woman/person/thing and then if there are gender-markers using the demonstratives without noun. The question whether this was seen as a demonstrative or personal pronoun is a question only for us today, it was no question for the speakers of the ancient time. A demonstatrative was a demonstrative. Only when a new form arises as e.g from German dieser to der to er, then one can talk of a personal pronoun. Latin uses the demonstratives is/ea/id or ille/illa/illud as a substitute for a lacking personal pronoun he/she/it. But this is seen from our modern perspective. French has developed il (he) from he first syllable of Latin ille (that one there). As long as ille was used it was a demonstrative. When il was developed the French had a personal pronoun. 

The third camp believes Japanese and Ryūkyūan belongs to a new family, the Japonic family. Since Japanese and Ryūkyūan do have many similarities, this theory receives the support of some scholars, but remains controversial. 

The second camp believes Japanese and Korean belong to a new [i.e. separate] language family. Scholars believing in this theory think that Japanese grammar is shockingly similar to that of Korean - both use SOV - and both have had strong influence from Old Chinese. Thus, some people believe that Japanese and Korean is a mixed language family arising from the creolization of Sino-Tibetan and Altaic. However, the lack of common vocabulary between Japanese and Korean also becomes a arguing point for dissenters. 

The classsification of Korean and Japanese (including Ryukyuan) has always been a focus for academic debate. There are generally speaking five camps: 

The first camp believes that Korean and Japanese do belong to this [Altaic] family, which could only be true if the Macro-Altaic theory is true, because Korean and Japanese have some Altaic characteristics. (note: this sentence is equally awkward in the original) 

All this can only give an idea of how the function word as could develop so many divergent uses. It would be very hard to prove such things in detail. Added: "as" is also in Low German. It is used as English as (when) and for comparison, just as English "as" in "as a friend". 

The Latin word for night is nox/noct-is and for eight octo. There is a similarity of sounds, but I think it is highly improbable that there is some etymological relationship between the two words. I can 't think of any idea that would lead to naming a quantity of 5+3 after night. What has night to do with a number? Even if we don't know the exact ideas behind the words for the numbers we may assume that there is some logic in them. Words are no arbitrary invention. 

To me the problem seems to be a bit theoretical or belonging to the philosophical field of logic. Perhaps part of your problems would be solved if you called "bean" in "bean soup" a noun used as compound element of a noun, and not an adjective. By the way "beany" is not registered as a word in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English. 

The fourth camp believes that Japanese and Korean are both isolates, unrelated to other languages of the world. Scholars believing in this view support it with the "lexical similarity problem". 

It seems like Indo-European languages are always stuck between throwing away complicated fusional grammar (like English) or retaining most of it (like Russian). Are there any Indo-European languages that reanalyzed the verb system into agglutination with series of suffixes rather than trying to stuff complex tense, aspect, and person information into a single arbitrarily chosen suffix? Or is it generally a rule that languages evolve away from agglutination and never towards it? It seems, for example, that Modern Japanese is a bit more fusional rather than agglutinative due to certain sound changes - for example in Classical Japanese "ikitari" went simplifying into "ikita" (which prevented further addition of affixes since -ta is not a verb citation form ending) and then fused into "itta", which obscures the root "ik", thus becoming somewhat fusional. 

I think it is a natural process in the long run of historical development that systems that become too complicated are simplified because speakers can't handle them anymore. You can see this in irregular verbs. The number of irregular verbs was relatively large, I guess about 250 to 300 a hundred or 200 years ago. But in spoken language only part ot them are used today. Grammatical endings of declension and conjugation have been simplified when comparing Latin, German and English. In English the simplification has been done thoroughly. As to vocabulary the English vocabulary is so extremely large that no one can handle it. But the normal vocabulary in spoken language is about 7,500 words. (I've read this recently, but have forgotten where.) 

Here is a copy of a post about present/past/future tense in Indonesian. Priscilla 86, the poster, is Indonesian. Our verbs don't change whether an action takes place in the past, present, or future. We simply have to insert time-qualifying words somewhere in our sentences (usually in the beginning). Also, we don't differentiate between singular and plural or male and female. For example: 

I'm not very updated on random theories regarding the Altaic theory (which I personally am agnostic about; though I slant towards not believing in it due to the extreme lack of any regular sound change patterns from "Proto-Altaic") and the classification of Korean and Japanese, and English Wikipedia generally regards the consensus being that Japonic and Korean are isolates. However, the Chinese Wikipedia gives many, many theories, and the Japonic language family is also regarded as controversial (!) in many articles in CW. However, the Chinese Wikipedia is quite famous for not citing things properly and containing boatloads of "weasel words" in part due to common Chinese style abusing the word 据说 (it is said; according to some) a lot. This huge block from Chinese Wikipedia has very little footnotes, so I'd like some help on distinguishing viable theories from fringe or probable Wikipedia editor pet theories. Here's a translation of the relevant parts from $URL$ , with the original. 

Grammar is description of how a language system works. But in order to describe a language system you need terms for word classes, verb forms and sentence structures. Such terms had just to be developed. No natural language begins with grammar. It is different with artificially created languages as Esperanto, but this has already been said. 

Here you see the Arabic letters in isolated position, at the beginning of a word, in the middle and at the end of a word. $URL$ 

to peek - into the alley to look - into the mirror to go - into the house to fall - into the pit Such structures are verb + preposition group (a where-to indication). If you analyze the structure as "go into - the house" and take "the house" as a direct object, then this is the wrong view. A direct object never answers the question where to. 

I'm curious why every language I've heard of has back or central vowels. Are there any languages that exclusively uses front vowels (say the phonemes /a/, /e/, /i/, /y/)? I want to know this more or less because I'm making a simple conlang that I want to only use front vowels - would this in real life be unstable and lead to language evolution that generates back vowels? Interestingly, shouting and screaming generally involve front vowels. Is there some natural vocalization resulting in back vowel sounds, which would lead to inclusion in language? 

[A typical Altaic languages] such as Tungusic (Nanai) Mini bithe-i "My book" Bi mini bithe-we-i hvla-i "I'm reading my book". (note: incomplete sentence in original) bithe-we-i's "we" is a patientive suffix, while "i" is a ferst person genitive (?) suffix. hvla-i's "i" is a first person conjugation for the verb. The remaining three characteristics do belong to Japanese, giving this theory significant support. However, Japanese shares very little vocabulary with other Altaic languages, so scholars against this viewpoint take this as strong evidence against this view. 

If a school says "found" in the above sentence is an adjective and only this answer is correct and the answer verb is not correct then I would say the examination board is narrow-minded. That's the least I would say. Sometimes test papers are idiotic. 

The forepaws of an animal are the paws in front. Our forefathers or forebears are those who were before us. We came after them in time. I see no problen with fore- or before, "before" could indicate local position and could refer to time. Today "before" is mainly used referring to time as in "before the war" and "after the war". When local position is spoken of "in front of" is preferred and "before" is mostly used in niches as "before the judge" or "before God". 

You'd better go home now (you'd is you had, past subjunctive). This formula of expression is not logical, it is transformed and there is no convincing explanation how it came to this illogical form. In normal grammatical English this would be: It would be better for you to go home now. But that's much longer. You simply have to see the above formula as a special idiomatic expression. And sometimes in the course of times such expressions change their form. Obviously some speakers feel that something is wrong with this expression and an attempt is made to better it by dropping "had": You better go home now. "better" is the normal comparative of the adjective good. In Oxford's explanation (have, 20a, posted by fdb) you get an idea that the above mentioned expression was transformed several times. But it would not be easy to reconstruct the various and exact stages of development of this expression.
