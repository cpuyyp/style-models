This depends entirely on your definition of meaningless. For nearly all commonly accepted definitions, the answer is "no." Empirically speaking, people do communicate meaning (by most definitions) through natural language. Conversely, much of what most people would consider "meaningful" cannot be expressed formally. I'm guessing you would consider (for example) love poetry to be "meaningless," but plenty of people would disagree. 

The movie The Matrix is most typically associated with the philosophy of Descartes, specifically, the part of Meditation I where he imagines that all he experiences is an illusion created by a malicious demon. However, Descartes is an Idealist (philosopher who believes that ideas and mental concepts represent a more fundamental level of reality than material objects) and Idealism in Western philosophy traces back to Plato, who believed that the entire material world as we experience it is just an imperfect copy of a more true, beautiful, eternal and good world composed entirely of ideals. So in this sense, The Matrix does have a strong connection to Plato, and as you mentioned, its central conceit --of a populace lulled into complacency by belief in a set of illusionary images --is strongly reminiscent of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Any connections to Aristotle are much more tenuous, particularly since Aristotle was focused on the world as we experience it, rather than on some deeper level of reality beneath it. The "Four Causes" are intended to apply broadly; there is no specific relationship between them and the Matrix's metaphysics. 

To expand on mobileink's correct answer, any given term from formal logic is never exactly "the same" as its natural language analog, because formal logic is an artificial construct created for the purpose of allowing for perfectly consistent definitions with mathematical precision, whereas natural language is messy and organic. Translating from natural language to formal language and back is a good exercise, but it can be dangerously misleading. Logical AND is (arguably) inspired by the concept of "and" in natural language, and has some obvious similarities, but it is not the same thing. There are subtleties in natural language that defy the exact interpretation necessary for formalization, and levels of precision available in formal language that could only be achieved in natural language with great difficulty. 

Arguably, fictional beings (at least ones with well established fictional histories) can possess moral qualities, if we take morality as describing structural patterns of behavior in relationship to a context. This, however, is a very different way of looking at morality than Kant's. As you imply, there is a substantial school of philosophy that strictly rejects all discussion of counterfactuals as nonsense (influenced by the rules of logic, which dictate that introduction of any counterfactual premise opens the door to every possible conclusion). Whether or not you ally yourself with this school of thought perhaps depends on whether you believe there are alternate routes to useful knowledge than those that follow only the pathways of strict logical proof. 

Mathematics and philosophy have had a long and intertwined history together. Ancient Greek philosophy is resonant with Euclidean geometry. The great Continental philosophers Rene Descartes and Blaise Pascal are as remembered for their contributions to the development and advance of mathematics as for their philosophical achievements, as is Leibniz. In the analytic world, figures such as Bertrand Russell and Alfred Tarski are noted for their work combining mathematics with the philosophical field of logic. So mathematics is clearly relevant to philosophy. But the connections are not always direct. Given that, it is not as clear that studying mathematics would definitely aid the study of philosophy. It's also worth noting that contemporary continental philosophy is not particularly mathematical. With that said, if you have an interest in mathematics now, and in philosophy later, I'd see no reason to discourage you from combining your passions. You'd certainly be following in the footsteps of some of the greatest practitioners of either field. 

The general rule is formal logic for rigor, informal logic for understanding. If you want to actually decisively establish a result, you do need formal logic, because informal reasoning can be ambiguous and misleading --it's quite possible for something important to be missed. The goal of formal reasoning is to preclude that possibility. However, it's not the way we actually think, so it helps to have an informal apprehension of the problem before tackling the formal proof. It's not quite the same situation in philosophy, because there is arguably quite a lot of important territory in philosophy that isn't susceptible to formal analysis (I say arguably because it's a controversial topic). On the other hand, everything in mathematics should theoretically be capable of being made formal. In a certain sense, mathematics IS making things formal. 

It's arguably not possible to "fully" understand any great work of philosophy. In the Platonic tradition, in fact, the general assumption is that you are being pointed in the direction of things that can never be fully explained, communicated or apprehended. With that said, Plato is extremely readable if you get a good translation, and is an excellent place to start studies of philosophy --he's arguably the best, and almost certainly the most influential philosopher within the entire Western canon. His work has an unfamiliar cultural context, and his end goal is to expand your mind beyond all ordinary limits, but he works hard to make that process as smooth and painless as possible. Starting with the shorter works and working your way to the longer ones is probably a good approach --the order you listed your works of Plato is probably as decent a reading order as any for that particular selection. Pythagoras was undoubtedly an influence on Plato, but many more people read Plato than read Pythagoras --it isn't necessary to have read Pythagoras in order to engage with Plato. 

Since the premises are contradictory, they can never be both true, so any conclusion of any truth value can be inserted in for "B" and the argument will still be valid (by the definition in your text). To be charitable to your tutor, let us assume he is starting with First Order Logic, which is more complex then propositional logic. In first order logic, more of the fine detail of the arguments is preserved, and we would expect more of a translation like this. 

In this particular case, given that quote, you might open the conversation by pointing out the many vile insults and obscene allusions in Shakespeare's plays, and ask why we perceive those so differently from the rap battle. You might also seek out some hardcore raps with positive messages and see how your audience reacts. In general, your approach would be to demonstrate that the content can vary widely, even when the presentation is similar, and to challenge your audience to identify what it is they are responding to --the content, the presentation, or their own associations. 

When expressed affirmatively and/or prescriptively as the concept that helping others ultimately helps ourselves, this is called "enlightened self interest" and is associated with the ethical philosophy of Utilitarianism. @Gordon's answer correctly identifies "psychological egoism" as the descriptive theory that people only ever act out of self-interest (with no value judgment applied to whether that is ultimately positive or negative). 

I'm positive that culture plays some influence, but it's wrong to ascribe dualism to Western thought, since Eastern philosophies from Taoism to Zoroastrianism also are filled with dualistic thinking. Intuitively, I think the likely answer is that dualism is easy. No one perspective is likely to perfectly capture anything of sufficient complexity, and the most natural move is to create a new one through opposition. Once two opposing sides have gained solidity, it's easier for each to recruit new partisans than for a wholly new perspective to emerge (especially since, as is the case in the two-party system of American politics, it may suit the interests of the two main sides to occasionally collude to make sure their opposition remains the chief frame of the debate). With that said, there remain plenty of perspectives that traffic in higher numbers, such as the four Western elements or the five elements of Eastern thought. Personally, I've spent many years exploring the philosophical insights that come from viewing things from three contrasting perspectives rather than two (and I'm quite sure I'm neither the first nor the last to do so). 

There are many philosophers (and perhaps even a few theologians) in the field of programming, so the two aren't intrinsically incompatible. If, however, the "boy" is interested in wholly devoting himself to religion, and if his material needs are modest, perhaps he should consider joining a religious order, or pursuing religious education, or seeking a job with a religious community service organization. There's no particular reason to pursue material success if he no longer finds it meaningful. 

I'm not sure how Popper resolved the problem, but in general, we treat statistical statements as concerning a set of events, not a single event. The statement "a uranium atom has an X/Y probability of decaying in time T," it means that we'll expect the observed ratio to approach X/Y as we observe more and more atoms. In a sense, this is still not strictly falsifiable, because there's nothing preventing statistical anomalies. However, standards can be set for acceptable expected deviations. 

There is a particular school of philosophy, called "analytic philosophy" which aspires to formal rigor, and there is a subject area within philosophy, called "formal logic" which is very closely related to mathematics and is often taught in a mathematical manner. Researching either of those topics should lead you to a wealth of good sources for what you are looking for. 

From a pragmatic point of view, we live in a multicultural, multi-faith world, in which religion is among the things that many people find most personally important. If we don't agree to respect each others' religions, regardless of our personal opinions about those religions, it will make it almost impossible for us to interact peaceably with anyone of different beliefs. 

Taking your question specifically as "how does the philosophical tradition reconcile faith and science"? 

There are some people who believe our universe is contained within a "multiverse" which contains all possibilities (which personally I find a depressing prospect, since it would arguably reduce to meaninglessness any given event happening anywhere). The "multiverse" is highly speculative, however, and there are plenty of other people who disbelieve in it altogether. On the other hand, as your friend pointed out, infinite doesn't necessarily mean encompassing all possibilities, even in the case that we do exist in a multiverse. Consider the decimal expansion of 1/3, which is 0.3333333... --infinite, yet without infinite novelty. A tougher philosophical case is the number pi, which apparently does contain infinite novelty. Imagine mapping all possible two digit combinations to letters, numbers and punctuation. Surely, somewhere in the depths of pi, this exact paragraph you are now reading must be thus encoded --after all, if infinite variety is to be provided, it seems clear that all possibilities must someday be exhausted. And, from that point of view, couldn't we also imagine that all possible worlds must be described somewhere within pi (see also, Borges' Library of Babel, and the infinite monkey hypothesis)? Yet is this another error? Consider also the Mandelbrot Set, the "most complex" object in mathematics. Upon expansion it presents graphs of infinite novelty --it never exactly repeats itself at any level of magnification. However, this doesn't mean that it will ever exactly resemble a picture of Kim Kardashian, or a dog wearing a hat, or so forth. Infinite novelty does not, in this case, mean the exhaustion of all possibilities, but rather an infinite exploration of variations upon a theme. 

Informal fallacies don't have exact definitions --they are just structural similarities between different poorly constructed arguments in natural language. They overlap with each other, there are edge cases where determining whether a fallacy is being committed is highly subjective, and they can manifest in widely different arguments. This isn't to say that a highly advanced real-world artificial intelligence (such as Watson) couldn't conceivably do a credible job, but would be at least as difficult as identifying any other fuzzy concept. Formal fallacies, on the other hand, are exact, objective structural flaws in artificial, constructed languages. They are as easy for a computer to find as a mistake in a math calculation. 

This does not follow at all. If you buy the "Doomsday Theory", which argues that statistically speaking, there are likely to roughly be as many people born in the future as have already lived, then you are accepting the idea that we can make accurate predictions of this nature purely on the basis of statistics. It might be false for many reasons, including that we don't have enough information to determine a proper reference class. However, the fact that we don't have the means to independently confirm its predictions is merely denying the premise that we can make such predictions by this method. It doesn't thereby provide significant support (let alone proof) for an unrelated unproven theory. Interestingly enough, the title "Doomsday Theory" is a complete misnomer, based on the popular belief that there are more people alive today than have ever lived and died, which would place us right at the end of human history, by the theory. But in fact, the actual number of people who have ever lived dwarfs the number of people who are alive now. So the theory is actually quite reassuring, it implies we have quite a long distance to go before extinction, even at current rates of population growth (which are unlikely to be sustained). 

I want to state at the onset, I have no personal opinion on this matter, I'm simply elucidating the logic of it: In general, the genetic fallacy is the illegitimate rejection of an argument strictly on the basis of its origin. It is considered a fallacy because a valid argument cannot be made invalid by changing its origin. Like all fallacies, it gains its force because of its close but superficial similarities to more legitimate lines of argument. In this particular case, your interlocutor is advancing an implicit argument of [his] own. That argument (we can infer) is that because the AATA is (putatively) committed to a certain core position on an certain issue of history, they are likely to endorse other positions that align with that first one, regardless of whether or not those positions are true. It's definitely not a strong argument --no open and shut case --but it's not necessarily fallacious. In particular, it's not the genetic fallacy due to the fact that there is actually a relationship between the premise "A believes X" and the conclusion "A claims Y" (because there does exist a relationship between X and Y). It would become a stronger argument in the case that X itself can be demonstrated to be false, because it then switches to an argument that the same factors that made A wrong on X make A more likely to be wrong on Y.
