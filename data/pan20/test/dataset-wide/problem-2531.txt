For a good understanding and how and when to one the notion of not-self, read: Selves & Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta, which includes much practical advices. For who can "self or emptiness" be virtuose and what might be a very wrong approach, read te teaching: Virtue without Attachment. Neither "to be or not to be", "self or no self" are questions and useful objects for a good walk on to beyond of such notions at all. One investigates and cuts of "just" what can not be regarded as Self, denying Self itself, is wrong view as well, and as you have investigated, lead fast to hell, acting on such view. And "it's just stuff happening, passing and arising and not self", is right, but that stuff has (a) cause, and if leading to suffering of oneself or of others, means to avoid the cause. Effects on causes can not be changed, nor made undone, but yet play a importand rule to learn to give skillful causes. Even today a broad done and beloved practice under the level of Buddha Dhamma, the practicing of a notion "there is no self", "I am nothing" is actually the cleaning (Uposatha) on the Jhains, a worthless practice of thiefs (wise say and known), and should always be rebuked: 

The deepest description of love I have come across in my walk is a state where one does not oblige oneself to draw a distinction between one and the subject of one's love. One can give freely to the other, not out of obligation or expectation or even altruism, but simply because one does not see a reason to distinguish between giving to their love and giving to oneself. 

I am not Buddhist, but from what I have heard from them, my experiences are sufficiently applicable to be worth voicing here. I have found great value in studying religions that I do not necessarily believe in. I find it to be a very powerful way to learn from a culture that is very different from my own. In particular, I have found it very effective at highlighting causes of suffering in my own life. The world is an amazing and beautifully diverse place. We have found many ways to live. Many things I was brought up to assume were simply "the way humanity acts" have been shown to be very culturally specific as I study how other cultures work. As an example in my own life, I have been raised as an American and thus naturally raised to believe in the "equality" of the sexes. Exploring other cultures, I found that the other cultures did not always have what I would call "equality." Studying the religions of these cultures helped me understand how a society could be "good" without equality of the sexes. At the end of the journey, I identified that it was not my fellow cultures that were wrong, it was that my personal definition of "equality of the sexes." My concept of what that phrase could mean was too rigid. Studying other cultures which have succeeded with different meanings helped me widen my opinions. I now hold a wider belief (preferring the word "incomparable" over "equal") which helped me elevate above self-inflicted suffering caused by my overly rigid definitions. However, there is a difficult counterpoint to this. Studying other religions is an easy question. However, some things cannot simply be studied in isolation. They must be lived. For these things, I recommend not seeking any carte blanche directive. Your life is too important to sign a blank checque. Seek those in your life that you respect for guidance on such things. It is my belief that much of the richness of life is found by experiencing contrasting worlds, but it can be difficult to do. It is easy to blur the worlds together, and miss out on the most important part of both worlds. This is why I recommend seeking guidance from those you respect on such activities. They may be able to help you set yourself on a path which gains as much as possible from the interaction without doing harm to either group, nor yourself. However, there's no one way to do it. Those in your life can help you find your way to do it. 

Eggman, are the homework assignments done? The basic works? If not, there is no base to build on. To get attached to aesthetic, to beauty of nature, is very needed, since one starts to practice that what gives cause to: long life, beauty, happiness and strength: Dana, Sila, Bhavana. The contemplations for that, after having the items understood, having developed the objects of contemplation, are this six found here: [Q&A] What should one meditate upon as a beginner? (Bhavana for Laypeople) As for the nature (plants animals), which is really not a ground for joy to contemplate, but a place to see how poor certain existances can be, to understand the confusion, its worthy to understand The Roots of Buddhist Romanticism. To see beauty in the ugly, good in bad... to even train such is a foolish practice of the fool. That is why real aesthetic objects are chosen. Not such without any generosity, virtue and even wisdom... nature is good to be wise reflected to develope samvega, "fear". (Seems to be redundant questioning of yours... there is no way aside of simply putting firts generosity and then virtue just into practic, Eggman.) [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other kinds of low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

Its not correct.You should not be looking for the nimitta when your practicing jhana. You should not be looking for anything or doing anything besides focusing on the meditation object. To practice Jhana means only focusing on one thing and one thing only until Jhana states form. You are basically doing ONE THING.For 1 hour,2 hours,5 hours,10 hours...etc---focusing on your meditation object---- If you even for a milli second have time to do other things,such as look for a nimitta or think about nimitta Concentration Weakens. Nimitta appearing directly correlates with how much attention you place on the meditation object. so while meditating don't focus on the breath while looking for nimitta,while anticipating a light,while...Drop these whiles. As long as these whiles exist concentration weakens.Weak concentration cannot sustain a stable nimitta. By the time the nimitta arises you will be GLUED,i mean GLUED DEAD to your object of meditation.Its like being bolted.Its not a state where you can easily shift or move around.You don't have to go looking for the nimitta,it will come to you. 

One could practice meditation until arriving at the knowledge of what is inside a black hole. However, it is less clear how long such a meditation could take. Perhaps it may take a million years or more to reach such extended awareness. Along the way, one's meditation may lead one to understand other things closer to home. Perhaps on the way one acquires awareness of why a teacher never replies to emails, or just exactly what is down in the crack between a car's seat and the center console, or where one's taxes go after they are sucked in by the IRS. One may even become aware of why one wishes to acquire knowledge of black holes, and find that the answer to this question is even more valuable than knowing the contents of black holes in the first place. At this time, one could choose to set aside the search for such knowledge, and continue along a path of one's choosing. The choice is always your own. 

Dheeraj Verma, It is described as nicca, unchangeable "stage" if reached, but since all Dhammas are anatta, it would be not unconditioned proper to regard it as such (atta), and the Buddha would have (like popular movements, Dhammakaya in Thailand for example and many individual teacher, doing laypeople a favor with such notion) easy more followers, since beings delight in "being". Of cause one can call it "true"- Self, if one seeks sense or Self in it. But it would not hold. If understanding "real self" as senseless, meaningless, as like somehow "aṭṭa", than it will probably hold. Consider the three meanings of aṭṭa carefully, high confussing or giving realese. Since one might see the base of atta and anatta, as a "game" of perceptions, stands. Certain Brahmic-Attman- and certain Mohayanic-appoaches, are dangerous, had lead to bad thing in history, on it's account. The Dhamma of the Buddha is not taught for certain Self-seeking, true self-purposes, but to get free from suffering. He rebuked a "rebelling" monk who said, "if you don't tell me if there is a Self or not, I will return to lower life", with asking himn "Did I ever told you that I will regard this matter, will ever teach such, as you ordained?" (Careful read and proper attention was required to understand, for the case not, not grasp the message, after the finder, not looking at the moon) 

Forcing awareness is a tricky concept. I would not be surprised if every practitioner of meditation has done it on occasion. The best analysis I have found for the issue is that forcing awareness can, in theory, allow one to become more insightful and aware. However, the act of doing so admits the "desire for insight and awareness." By meditating in this fashion, it is not possible to simply let that desire pass through you. It is held on to. At the very least, this is a desire which will not pass. It can obscure that which you are looking for. At its worst, it can lead you down a false target leading you along a less ideal path. I have found that forcing awareness in meditation can be effective for identifying illusions and assumptions, but it is less effective at actually encouraging awareness. Accordingly, in this complicated world with its many illusions and assumptions, I feel it has its place. However, the traditional approaches as advised by the other answers are more effective as these things they do best. A focus on them is wise. 

Because for the First Jhana to arise the Five hindrances must be abandoned. You abandon it by focusing on one object. By doing so you blot out the hindrances. The more you focus on one object the more the hindrances gets blotted out and suppressed. 

Yes here it is. 40 Traditional Meditations Due to their complexity,some of these meditations can only lead to access concentration (upacara samadhi). 

Yes Jhana is about developing concentration.But you have to ask yourself What is Concentration? Concentration has many levels,but generally it's the state of mind that isn't obstructed by the hindrances.By practicing the Jhanas you are systematically letting go/abandoning the hindrances by means of suppression and subtituting it with the opposites.We need concentration to see clearly.When you see thing clearly you realise the truth and attain liberation.
