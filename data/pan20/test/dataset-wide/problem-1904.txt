No. It's the responsibility of the company to take whatever steps they deem necessary to ensure that one person doesn't become so critical that the company can't function without him. That said, if you are a critical resource, have you had a conversation with your boss about whatever is causing you to look for another position to determine whether there is something they can do to make you happier in your current position? From a negotiating standpoint, your leverage probably won't ever be higher than it is now. And from the company's standpoint, it is likely to be far more efficient to give you whatever you need to be happy rather than trying to replace you in the middle of the project. 

This is very much a signaling problem. Employers are looking for attributes in candidates that are very difficult to demonstrate in an interview. So they are looking for signals that are relatively easy for candidates that have those attributes to send but relatively difficult for candidates that don't have those attributes to send. These signals can be useful even when they are far from perfect by helping the interviewer increase their odds of making a good hire. Resigning a job with nothing else lined up is generally a very poor signal because it often indicates something negative but hard to prove. Resigning in this manner often signals prior poor performance because resignations come in very different forms. Organizations are generally very slow to actually fire white collar workers like programmers that aren't pulling their weight. Managers dislike the confrontation, the employee is generally making some contribution so letting them go makes the manager's near-term job harder, dismissals often negatively affect the morale of the remaining team members who are now anxious about whether their job is on the line, etc. Many organizations end up suggesting to the employee in increasingly direct terms that they ought to consider resigning. Often, by the time a programmer resigns, they were effectively fired. The resignation was just a convenient way for the employee to save face and for the manager to arrange an orderly transition of responsibilities. If a hiring manager looks at the resume of someone that resigned without having another job lined up, the presumption is that the candidate resigned in lieu of being fired. Of course, it's possible to rebut that presumption. A reason that seems compelling to the interviewer, as @HLGEM suggests, is one way to rebut the presumption. A glowing reference from the previous employer is another. A call to HR is likely only to produce the dates that you were employed and your title, HR isn't going to say whether you were a top performer that left entirely voluntarily or whether you were a mediocre performer that saw the writing on the wall and resigned ahead of the axe. Your previous manager might be in a position to make that distinction but many companies have a policy that prevents previous managers from confirming more than HR would. Resigning this way also tends to signal a lack of responsibility. If you can support yourself playing poker, I'll wager that you have a vastly larger tolerance for risk than the average person. That means that the people that are interviewing you are going to be viewing your actions through their much more risk-averse eyes. To those eyes, resigning a good job with no immediate prospect of another job on the horizon is a terribly risky move. That's particularly true when you realize that their financial cushion (which will generally be part of their calculus) is likely to be much more tenuous than yours apparently is. Most people can't afford to go without a paycheck for 5 years without seriously draining their retirement funds. And most people would be miserable if they became unemployed for even a month or two while drawing down their cash reserves even if they had them. Since your actions appear much riskier to the interviewer than they do to you, both because of your appetite for risk and because of your knowledge of your actual financial position, interviewers would tend to fear that you'd have much more tolerance for risk in your working life than they would deem reasonable. Then, there are the issues that others pointed out. Employers generally want people that are passionate about what they do. They want people that are dedicated to the companies they work for. And they want people whose skills are up to date. Someone that walks away from a similar job to take a break for months or even years is someone that may be lacking one or all of these attributes. This isn't to say that you actually lack any of these qualities, of course. But from the hiring manager's standpoint, a resignation with no job lined up certainly increases the probability that a candidate has some sort of latent defect. As a poker player, I'm sure you're accustomed to trying to infer an opponent's private information (their hole cards in poker, their actual work habits in the interview process) based on their public actions (when and how they bet in poker, their decisions about when and how to leave a job in the interview process). In any given interaction, you can be fooled easily enough. But over time, if you're playing the percentages, you'll make more correct decisions if you factor those signals into your estimates. 

The assumption that any payment from an employer to an employee is taxable and that the employer is quoting the pretax number is pretty basic. Employers generally don't know (or care) what tax bracket you're in, what deductions and credits you're eligible, or what states you might owe taxes in so they have no way to know how much of your salary or bonus you'll have to pay. Since they didn't say anything to indicate that the relocation bonus would be an after-tax figure, you're going to make yourself look bad if you try to re-open negotiations after agreeing to the offer already. How bad this will make you look is dependent on a number of factors. If you've just graduated, this is your first interaction with the joys of taxes, and you really need the extra money in order to relocate successfully, it's a lot easier to apologize for making a poor assumption and ask for a bit more relocation assistance. If you've got 20 years of experience in your field, on the other hand, a desire to renegotiate is going to be a lot more problematic. People are a lot more forgiving of mistakes by entry-level workers than senior-level workers. 

The significance, if any, is going to be specific to the company. Sometimes a "Foo Technician 1" is the entry-level role for a Foo Technician. Sometimes it's the most experienced role. Sometimes, an organization will document their naming/ numbering convention on their web site (this is somewhat common for roles in government and other public entities). Most often, though, the job description is going to be a more useful representation of what the job entails than the title. 

Most at-will employment in the US doesn't involve an employment contract. There are documents that get signed, of course, for non-disclosure agreements, tax withholding, benefit enrollment, etc. But you generally wouldn't have an employment contract as such. The closest you'll come for most people is an acknowledgement that you've read the employee handbook that lays out the company policies but is subject to change at any time. Two-weeks notice is solely a cultural expectation. You're entirely free to announce at noon that you're going to lunch and then call at 1 and inform them that you won't be back. If you do that, however, your former coworkers will be less likely to have wonderful things to say about you if you need a reference or encounter them later. It's generally considered professional to at least offer your employer a couple weeks in which to transfer tasks to others and make sure that tasks aren't dropped. Could an employer draft a document requiring two weeks notice? Sure. But it probably wouldn't do much good. If there were penalties to not giving notice, the agreement would almost certainly need to impose some sort of reciprocal burden on the employer. From the employer standpoint, since 99% of your good employees are going to give notice anyway, the agreement wouldn't accomplish much other than to impose some sort of obligation on the employer. And despite the image we have, Americans aren't anxious to involve lawyers which would be necessary if a company wanted to enforce some sort of penalty for not giving notice. So you could have an agreement. It just wouldn't have any practical benefit to the employer. 

You should list things on your application that would cause a reasonable employer to prefer you over another candidate. It is rare that club memberships, regardless of the type of club, meet that standard. Actively participating in clubs and organizations frequently makes you a more interesting and well-rounded person. But it rarely provides a reason for an employer to prefer you over some other candidate. Occasionally, however, particularly for a new college graduate, club memberships do allow you to highlight some aspect of your skill set that you would not otherwise have. If you were the president of the club, for example, and that is the best way for you to discuss the leadership qualities you would bring to the job, it may well make sense to list clubs and organizations. If you organized successful petition campaigns and worked with the administration to change policies or with the legislature to pass laws, that likely shows a wealth of professional skills that employers are likely to value. If you are just a member of the organization or your involvement doesn't obviously demonstrate professional skills, it is unlikely to be appropriate to list the club. If yours is one of those rare cases where it makes sense to list membership in an organization on your resume, then it's worth considering the nature of the club and whether that is likely to hurt you. To that end, one question you'd have to ask yourself is whether you would want to work at a place that would discriminate against you on the basis of sexual orientation. That's a very personal question-- some people need the job and have relatively few options, other people would rather wait for a better fit. If you can honestly answer that you would rather not take a job with a firm that would discriminate, then you just have to be concerned with whether it shows your professional skills. If you want to be considered for jobs that would potentially discriminate, then you need to determine whether the level of discrimination you perceive in your particular area and profession are likely to outweigh whatever professional benefits skills you would want to talk about in an interview. That, again, is a question that only you can answer.
