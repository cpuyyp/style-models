The diffeomorphisms which are generated by (time-dependent) Hamiltonian vector fields are said to be Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms form a subgroup of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms (actually, they are a subgroup of the connected component of the identity). As you observe, locally they cannot be distinguished from symplectic diffeomorphisms. But they are a much smaller class. For instance, the Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^2$ are exactly those symplectic (i.e. area-preserving) diffeomorphisms which have a lift $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\varphi(x) = x + \psi(x)$ where $\psi$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and satisfies $$ \int_{[0,1]^2} \psi(x) dx =0. $$ In particular, nontrivial translations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ are symplectic but not Hamiltonian (the latter fact is true also for $\mathbb{T}^{2n}$). As for your doubts related to local existence: if $M$ is a compact manifold you of course have global existence, but these definitions make sense also on non-compact manifolds. Indeed, the non-exactness of $\imath_X \omega$ can be detected on a compact subset $K$ of $M$ (a circle is enough) and you can find $\tau>0$ such that the flow of a neighborhood of $K$ exists up to time $\tau$. 

A first naive guess would be that this classifies varieties $Y \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ which become projectively isomorphic to $X$ over $\bar k$; however this is clearly seen to be false on taking $X = \mathbb{P}^n$. It might help to put this problem into a more general framework. Namely, let $(X,L)$ be a projective variety equipped with a line bundle $L$. Denote by $\mathrm{Aut}(X,L)$ those automorphisms of $X$ which preserve the isomorphism class of $L$. 

Hopefully there are not some necessary local conditions here that I overlooked. In my application I am happy to change $f$ as required so that one can assume that $f$ is sufficiently "general". Moreover, I can even assume that $f$ is of very large degree if necessary to simplify things. I would normally try to prove something like this using the large sieve, however the large sieve gives the poor upper bound $X/(\log X)$, whereas I would like a power saving. If necessary, I'm happy to assume some standard conjectures (e.g. the abc conjecture). 

Consider a smooth $k$-dimensional foliation of the unit ball $B$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, all of whose leaves are diffeomorphic to $k$-disks. Question: Is there a leaf whose $k$-volume is at least $\omega_k$? Here $\omega_k$ denotes the volume of the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^k$. Particular cases. If $k=1$, the leaf through the origin (in this case a curve) has the desired property. If $k=n-1$, the leaf which divides the ball into two regions of equal volume has the desired property, by a relative isoperimetric inequality. A possible argument. Replace each leaf $F$ by a $k$-submanifold which minimizes the $k$-volume among those with boundary $F\cap \partial B$. Among the minimal submanifolds obtained in this way, consider one which passes through the origin: its $k$-volume is at least $\omega_k$ by the monotonicity formula, and the $k$-volume of the leaf with the same boundary is even larger. I know how to make this argument rigorous when the foliation is close enough to the foliation by parallel affine subspaces (but a reference or a more elementary proof also for this perturbative case would be very useful). In general, besides for possible singularities of the minimizers (which should not disturb), the problem I see is how to guarantee that at least one of them passes through the origin. 

Certainly the answer should be yes, but I can't find a proof in the literature. Note that by a result of Iskovskih, minimal surfaces either have Picard number $2$ and a conic bundle, or Picard number $1$. In the case that the Picard number is $2$, non-rationality is proven in Corollary 1.7 of Iskovskih - Rational surfaces with a sheaf of rational curves and with a positive square of canonical class. Thus one may assume that $\mathrm{Pic}(S) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, generated by $-K_S$. Manin's proof does not naively generalise to the case of $d=2,1$, as he uses many facts about cubic surfaces (e.g. he uses the rational map given by sending a pair of points $(P,Q)$ to the third intersection point of $S$ with the line though $P,Q$). I was thinking that perhaps one could reduce the case of $d=2,1$ to cubic surfaces. For example, if $d=2$ and the Galois action on the lines is maximal (i.e. given by the Weyl group $W(\mathbf{E}_7)$), then there exists a finite field extension $K$ of $k$ such that $S_K$ contains a line $L$, and the blow-down of $L$ is a minimal cubic surface. Thus $S_K$ is non-rational by Manin's result, hence $S$ is non-rational. But it is not clear to me that such an extension $K/k$ always exists in general. 

This is certainly true if you choose $\lambda$ to be strictly smaller than the smaller eigenvalue of $DX(0)$. You may prove it inductively, by noticing that for a given $y$ the function $t\mapsto D^{\alpha}_y \Phi_t(y)$ solves a linear equation. For instance, the first step goes as follows: the path of matrices $W(t):= D_y^{\alpha} \Phi_t(y)$ solves the ODE $$ W'(t) = DX(\Phi_t(y)) W(t), \quad W(0)=I, $$ where $\|DX(\Phi_t(y)) - DX(0)\| \leq C_0 e^{\lambda_0 t}$ for all $t\leq 0$. Then for every $\lambda_1<\lambda_0$ you can find $C_1$ such that $\|DX(\Phi_t(y))\| \leq C_1 e^{\lambda_1 t}$ for all $t\leq 0$. A useful lemma for proving this and getting the uniformity you need is the following: given a continuous bounded path of matrices $t\mapsto A(t)$, $t\geq 0$, denote by $W_A(t)$ the solution of the linear Cauchy problem $$ W_A'(t) = A(t) W_A(t), \quad W_A(0) = I. $$ Assume that $\|W_A(t)W_A(s)^{-1}\|\leq c e^{\lambda (t-s)}$ for every $t\geq s\geq 0$. Then for every continuous bounded path of matrices $t\mapsto H(t)$, $t\geq 0$, there holds $$ \| W_{A+H}(t)W_{A+H}(s)^{-1}\|\leq c e^{\mu (t-s)}, \quad \forall t\geq s\geq 0, $$ with $\mu := \lambda + c \|H\|_{\infty}$. (Sorry if here I switched to positive time, that's just because I am more used to work with stable manifolds). 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$. Let $X$ be a smooth Fano variety over $k$ and let $\ell \neq p$ be a prime. 

Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be a number field. We say that a rational prime $p$ splits in $K$ if there exists a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ above $p$ of interia degree $1$. 

Let $k$ be a number field. Recall that Faltings proved the famous Tate conjecture, which states that for any abelian variety $X$ over $k$ and any prime $\ell$, the natural map $$\mathrm{End}(X) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_\ell \to \mathrm{End}(V_\ell(X))^{\mathrm{Gal}(\bar k/k)},\qquad (*)$$ is an isomorphism, where $V_\ell(X)$ denotes the usual Tate module of $X$ tensored with $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$. If I understand it correctly however, this is but one part of the Tate conjecture, which in general states that the cycle class map $$A^r(X) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_\ell \to H^{2r}(\bar X, \mathbb{Q}_\ell)^{\mathrm{Gal}(\bar k/k)},$$ is an isomorphism for all $r$. The "Tate conjecture" as I state it in $(*)$ is but the case $r=1$ of this conjecture.
