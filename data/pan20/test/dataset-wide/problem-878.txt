From this book it seems you can have $\epsilon_{core}$ values raging from ~$30\%$ (a low value) up to $70\%$ (which is more "usual", i.e., requested by theories). More information can be found here and here. 

Not really. Quasars do indeed need a SMBH to be powered, and this is a necessary condition. But, Quasar phase only lasts for tens millions to few billions years. This means that, in a more recent universe, Quasars are turned off but the host galaxy... is still there. And the SMBH also do. This is exactly as our Galaxy case ($Sgr A^*$), where the evidences for the presence of a SMBH are among the strongest ones, but still no nuclear activity is present. However, there are tons of study to infer the proper amount of AGNs in the whole Universe by using luminosity functions. 

The key for stellar classification is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (or HRD for brevity), also know as the color-magnitude diagram. 

As far as I know, this is an only theoretical object, it has never been observed. In the original paper from the authors, they provide some observable characteristics of these objects, like some peculiar emission lines. You can imagine the chemistry of such an object would be really unique. Here an article for a possible identification link 1, very recent work (2014). And here some calculations link2. 

You can exclude the 'considering the distance' piece - of course Oort Cloud objects could transfer between different gravitational fields. However what is it you think will make this transfer? Without some sort of gravitational impetus why would one of these objects leave the solar system? And if you do manage to slingshot one out of the solar system at a high enough speed to exit the Sun's gravity, remember that most directions end up very far away from any other solar systems. Tl;Dr sure, but not very likely 

Stars are much less bright than the earth in full sunlight as per your picture. So with the exposure required to give that picture of earth, no, you won't see stars. But move the camera a bit to the side, so earth is not in shot and you can see stars. The same goes for the sun - make sure sunlight is not entering the lens, and you can easily see stars. Sunlight doesn't block any light out (unless you want to see a star that is actually behind the sun) it's just so bright that you need to make sure it isn't in shot. 

Be aware there are differing formats. SPK is the newer format - the older text format seems to be deprecated. It's worth having a look at the documentation on this jplephem python library as it explains the format reasonably well. If you do use SPK, you'll need to read all of the documentation in NASA's SPK repository I'm not sure if this is from the same author as this library - worth a read as it discusses the FITS format. 

(Here $R_e$ is the so called effective radius). For completeness, another illuminating picture from here: 

I am not expert of GRBs, but this high-oscillation behavior seems a characteristics of GRBs: you can see few examples here. In fact, the BAT time resolution is very high ($\sim100\mu s$), then you can resolve very tiny details of the source's timing event. About the source variability, this is something more theoretical (so I can not be of much help), and there is no accepted theory, but qualitatively, in some models the gamma rays are produced by clumpy clouds of relativistically ejected material, which could account for the high variability indeed.

Or, that is equivalent, you can express your first equation (Stefan-Boltzmann), in Solar units as well (as shown here). Try it out just by your self: choose a mass, or observationally speaking, choose a luminosity. Then trace your line on the HR diagram, and find your star. That star has a defined temperature (spectral class), Mass and Radius as well. If you need the exact equations, feel free to ask please. Nice aim, anyway. Have fun! 

In a homogeneous and isotropic Universe (even if recent observations challenge this hypothesis), you can derive the Friedmann equations, which describe the evolution of the Hubble constant with time: $\frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H(t) = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}$ (with $c=1$) (Equation $1$) where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor, $\dot{a}$ its derivative, $G$ the gravitational constant, $\rho$ the matter density, $\frac{k}{a^2}$ the spatial curvature (a parameter that describes the metric of the Universe), and $\Lambda$ the cosmological constant (an integration constant added by Einstein). It could be useful to rewrite the equation as: $H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}(\rho + \rho_{\Lambda}) - \frac{k}{a^2}$ where $\rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{\Lambda}{8 \pi G}$ is the "density of cosmological constant". We can also expand the matter density as $\rho = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation}$. So we have a "total" density $\rho_{tot} = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation} + \rho_{\Lambda}$. The destiny of the Universe depends on this amount. In case of $\rho_{tot} > \rho_{crit}$, or equivalently a closed Universe ($k=+1$), the equation $(1)$ becomes: $\dot a^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho a^2 -1$ Which points out that the scale factor must have an upper limit $a_{max}$ ($\dot a^2$ must be positive). This in turn means that the second derivative $\ddot a$ of the scale factor must be negative, when approaching $a_{max}$, that is the scale factor function inverts its behavior: 

A star is described as such whether or not it has planets. There doesn't appear to have ever been a need, and to be honest, I can't think of any need for one. When it was assumed (in historical times) that we were on the only planet, stars were not thought to have planets. The title worked then. Now, as we know most stars are likely to have planets as part of normal formation, we can still call them stars. Typically words are invented as there is a need for them. 

Of course Earth life would be fine at first (unless it was Earth that was removed ...) but the orbits of asteroids and other bodies may be perturbed, which could lead to an influx of asteroid strikes - potentially - in the longer term. 

This is really simple once you get it: The usual analogy here is to look at the surface of a balloon (which is a surface in 3D space, rather than 3D space itself, but the analogy still works) A partially inflated balloon has tight curvature, but as it is inflated, the curve decreases - the surface at any point becomes 'flatter' From an article on this topic on scienceblogs.com: 

This question isn't really very clear or practical. You need to add quite a bit of information, eg which planet? 

The reason you would want to cover most of your aperture is so you can point directly at a huge light source (i.e. a star), but ignore most of the light coming from it. This makes it easier to directly detect faint features around the source that would ordinarily be washed out by the light from the source itself (i.e. planets and the like). I believe this is what LocalFluff was getting at with "advanced coronagraphy," and I don't believe it has anything to do with interferometery. 

Radioactive dating works based on the assumption that once a particular rock (in this case, a tiny zircon crystal) has cooled and solidified, the material within it will not be exchanged with material outside it. Since the rock contains trace (known) amounts of radioactive isotopes at its formation, measuring the amount of radioactivity today gives the amount of time since that rock solidified and cooled. The USGS claims that the age of the zircon crystals is roughly the age of the Earth. They are doing so based on the assumption that the zircon crystals solidified shortly after the Earth was formed. Considering that Earth formed when a diffuse cloud of tiny particles collapsed into a comparatively tiny ball, releasing a bunch of potential energy in doing so, it is reasonable to suspect that Earth, just after it formed, was extremely hot, certainly hot enough to melt zircon at 1900 degrees C. As discussed above, melting something "resets the clock" with respect to isotope composition, as new radioactive isotopes readily diffuse in to replace the old ones. Therefore, their assumption seems to be well grounded. As to the last question, it depends on what you mean by "know". Obviously we don't have planet-sized clouds of dust to play around with in laboratories, and we also don't really have enough observation time to see these things happen (even though I said they occur "quickly", not many processes on the scale of planets take less than a few thousand years to happen). So we will probably never see more than a snapshot of this evolution process directly. Then again, if you trust the simulations that people are doing nowadays (considering how much thought is generally put into those things, it's reasonable to do so), we seem to have a general idea of how long the collapse should take, which is on the order of a million years, starting from the phase where the dust has already collapsed into 1 km-wide bits: $URL$ 

This is a very well posed question, thanks! The problem is, we still don't know. What we suppose, is that dark matter came first. Primordial fluctuations of dark matter made the right conditions to accrete enough mass to build SMBHs, and then the surrounding galaxy. But still we don't know if, the SMBH comes from merging, of other SMBHs or galaxies, or from high massive BH that are called seed (of the order of $100\,M_{Sun}$). Perhaps, there are very recent developments, which could be known by the experts, but until few years ago, this was the scenario. About the mass issue, we could have a better reasoning if we think to the influence spheres. We discovered a relation between the SMBH mass and many bulge properties (i.e., the luminosity, the velocity dispersion, and others). This means that an object of the order of $\sim1$ pc, influences an object of the order of $\sim1$ kpc (maybe $\sim3$). Plus, the bulge structure is essential to the formation and characterization and classification of the host galaxy. 

It is clear that the star undergoes a change in position. Then usually, the radial measurements go along with astrometrical measurements, to identify the position of the star along the planet's orbit. Of course, you need some conditions are verified to allow this measurement. First of all, you planet must be massive enough to bring a sensible change in the position of the star. Then your instrument must be sensible enough to resolve the tiny effect originated by this change. Possibly, also other conditions play a role, but I am not an expert (you can take a look at here). For a general comprehension, also a wiki for Methods of detecting exoplanets. 

Unlike all other meteor showers, which originate from comets, Geminids originate from asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Seeing a large number of meteors last night, I noticed they seemed to be much more green than other meteors, but is there anything else I should expect to see different to other meteor showers? Brightness, size, length of trail etc? 

This question has two parts: Surface Temperatures A very useful diagram which shows surface temperatures, and also gives you the temperature of any star you can observe is the Herzsprung-Russell Diagram, this one from le.ac.uk. 

While the surface of a meteor will indeed be pretty sterilised by re-entry, remember that a meteor also has an inside. If it doesn't burn up completely, then parts of the inside may remain cool enough for bacteria/viruses to survive. The range of environmental conditions life can survive in is incredibly wide, so this is not impossible. 

There are different infinities. You could say that there are an infinite number of planets, so probability says that there could be humans on a small percentage of them. Say for arguments sake humans exist on 0.001% of those planets.0.001% of infinity is infinity, right? Well, sort of, but it's obviously a smaller infinity than the number of planets. Conversely there are 99.999% of planets without humans, which is a much bigger infinity. So to all intents and purposes the answer is no, for this mental exercise. And in reality it's a no, as any humans on other planets would pretty much have to not be humans any more, as they are so far away that unless we have instantaneous or FTL travel, evolution would have changed them/us. 

Not all models of dark energy assume it constant. However, when this is assumed true, dark energy is usually compared to the energy density of the vacuum. In other words, while the Universe expands, the dark energy increases proportionally, so its ratio with the Universe volume (the density) stays constant. Or, better, we generally believe those models where the dark energy is a constant because they fit better our observations of the Universe, in particular the Big Bang model, which describes how our Universe evolves. If you like some math, you can have it here. 

Since it seems you don't know the equations, I will try to keep it simple. However, just keep in mind that, in principle, there is no difference between Galactic and extragalactic Cepheids, in this context. Now, we know that a Period-Luminosity relation holds for the Cepheids: $P\sim L$ Where $P$ is the pulsation period observed from the Cepheid, and $L$ is the observed luminosity. We also know that: $L\sim d$ where $d$ is the distance of the source. Then it is like to write $P\sim d$. This means that, if we observe the pulsation period of a Cepheid, we know its distance, and this allows to know the distance of the host galaxy as well. Some basic sources: Cepheid variable Classical Cepheid variable with some numbers And some diagrams too 

The gravitational pull of all the planets and the sun, and the rest of the galaxy and the universe, all play a part, but gravitational effects fall off with distance. For Earth's orbit, the Sun is far and away the single biggest influence. Jupiter perturbs our orbit slightly, but with it or without it we have a simple elliptical orbit round the sun. We can measure the perturbation in our orbit from all the planets, but the effects are minor. When it comes to gravitational effects on small bodies passing one of the planets, however, the effects can be dramatic - an asteroid passing close to Jupiter will be moved far from its original path. The same would be true when passing close to Saturn or in fact any planet - just to a lesser degree. So while you can't say that Jupiter protects Earth from anything, especially not the Oort Cloud, you also can't say that it draws objects in. Anything out in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud will be orbiting the barycentre of the solar system (which is within the Sun) and will keep doing that unless knocked out by something like a collision with another object, or the pull of other Kuiper belt objects like Pluto, which can give a much greater tug. 

This effect is called libration - and it is an oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other (from Wikipedia) It is down to three factors:
