there is a surjection $[0,1]\to X$, $X$ is compact, connected, locally connected and second-countable. 

What should I call a poset with the property that each element has AT MOST ONE predecessor? (I'm actually interested in the special case in which there are no infinite descending chains.) CLARIFICATION: I mean each element has a unique immediate predecessor. As you go higher up there can be branching, but never collapsing. That is, I don't want to allow $a < z$ and $b < z$ with $a$ and $b$ incomparable; but I am happy with $a< y$ and $a< z$ with $y$ and $z$ incomparable. FURTHER: 

Another approach is to present both as theorems, but to present only A as a `marquee result' in the introduction, mentioning that it follows from the stronger but more technical B. 

It follows that a Hausdorff space satisfying the conditions of (2) is a quotient of $I = [0,1]$. Cor: Every connected compact manifold is a quotient of $I$. Since $I$ is a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have your answer. Cor: Every compact connected $m$-manifold is a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n\geq 1$. 

I like to observe that the diagonal map $X\to X\times X$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant, hence induces a map of homotopy colimits. Analyzing this map with $X = K( \mathbb{Z}/2,n)$ gives the squares. The Adem relations follow from an extra symmetry (transpose) of the double composition $X \to X^4$. 

Can someone point me to a good (hopefully simple and brief) place to read about the basics of homotopy orbits for pointed spaces? More detail: As I understand it, in the unpointed case, we use the projection $\mathrm{pr}_X: EG \times X \to X$ to replace the $G$-shaped diagram $X$ with the cofibrant $G$-shaped diagram $EG\times X$; and then the homotopy orbit space is the homotopy colimit of the diagram $X$, which is the categorical colimit of $EG\times X$. I'd like a description of the pointed case in which it is shown that $EG_+ \wedge X\to X$ is a cofibrant replacement in the appropriate category of diagrams. Even More (Inspired by T. Goodwillie's comment): This is what I think, too, but I feel like I'm missing something, because in the pointed case, why can't I just use the cone on $G$ instead of $EG$? It is contractible and $G$ acts freely on the nonbasepoint cells, right? So I could just as easily use $CG_+ \wedge X$. but this is clearly wrong! EDIT: Cone idea is wrong because of the cone point, so I feel pretty good about my understanding of the theory. I'd still like a good reference. 

The answer to (1) is yes: it follows from the "exponential law" $C(X\times I, Y) \cong C(I, C(X,Y))$. I'll hazard an answer to (2): If you are dealing with spaces such as manifolds or finite complexes, the definition in terms of maps $X\times I \to Y$ allows you to study homotopy using the same kinds of spaces. 

it is shown that every homotopy localization functor is of the form $L_f$ for some map $f$ if Vopenka's principle is added to ZFC, but not without it. 

If $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected, and $Y$ is a space with $\pi_n(Y) \cong G$ and no other nontrivial homotopy groups, then the map $[X, Y] \to \mathrm{Hom}(\pi_n(X), G)$ is a bijection (by elementary obstruction theory). It follows that if $Z$ is a space with $\pi_n(Y) \cong H$ and no other nontrivial homotopy groups, then $[Y, Z] \cong \mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$, and consequently, that if $G\cong H$, $Y$ and $Z$ are weakly equivalent. Assuming they are CW complexes, they are homotopy equivalent; we call the common homotopy type $K(G,n)$. So, we know that the loop space operator $\Omega$ has the effect of shifting homotopy groups downward. Thus $\Omega Y$ is a space with $\pi_{n-1}(Y)\cong G$ and all other homotopy groups trivial. Thus $Y \simeq K(G, n-1)$. 

You can build them using a homology decomposition and read off the number of cells in each dimension from the homology groups. For any simply-connected space, this will give you a construction by iterated cofiber sequences $M_n \to X(n-1) \to X(n)$ where $M_n$ is a Moore space and $X = \mathrm{colim} X(n)$. If you construct $M_n$ efficiently and give $X(n)$ the inherited CW structure, then this will be the absolute fewest cells possible in each dimension to construct a space with the required homology. By an efficient construction of $M = M(G,n)$ where $G$ can be generated by $k$ elements but not fewer, and an exact sequence $0\to F_1\to F_0\to G\to 0$ where $F_0$ is free of rank $k$. Then we topologize this to get a cofiber sequence $W_1 \to W_0 \to M$, where $W_0$ is a wedge of $k$ $n$-spheres and $W_1$ is also a wedge of $n$-spheres. 

To define the relative homotopy groups of a pair $(X, A)$, let $i:A\to X$ be the inclusion, and write $F_i$ for its homotopy fiber. Then $$ \pi_n(X, A) = \pi_{n-1}(F_i). $$ In your examples, the inclusion maps are nullhomotopic, so the homotopy fibers are $$ \Omega \Sigma \mathbb{R}P^2 \times \mathbb{R}P^2 \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \Omega \Sigma \mathbb{C}P^2 \times \mathbb{C}P^2, $$ respectively. Since these spaces are path-connected, the relative homotopy "groups" in question are trivial. 

The cup product is a gussied-up version of the map induced by the reduced diagonal map $\bar \Delta$, which is the composite of the ordinary diagonal $\Delta: X\to X\times X$ and the quotient map $q: X\times X \to X\wedge X$; note that $q$ is the cofiber of the inclusion $i: X\vee X\to X\times X$. If $X$ is a suspension, then the map $\Delta$ has a lift (up to homotopy) $\lambda: X\to X\vee X$ through the inclusion $i : X\vee X \to X\times X$ of the wedge, and hence $\bar \Delta \simeq q\circ \Delta \simeq q\circ i \circ \lambda \simeq *$. One way to see the lifting is to lift the adjoint; and this is easy because $\Omega(X\vee X) \to \Omega (X\times X)\cong (\Omega X) \times (\Omega X)$ has a homotopy section given by $s: (\omega, \tau) \mapsto (i_1\circ \omega) * (i_2\circ \tau)$, where $i_1, i_2: X\to X\vee X$ are the inclusions of the summands and $*$ denotes concatenation of paths. 

The case of $n= 11$ cubes is instructive. The algorithm here says that you need to put a rectangle with area $3$ onto a $2\times 2\times 2$ cube, which cannot be done. If you attempt to put three cubes on one face of the $2\times 2\times 2$ cube, you see that you can improve the arrangement to $12$ cubes without increasing area. 

If $X$ has torsion in its cohomology, thereâ€™s nothing you can say. If $X$ is simply-connected with torsion free (co)homology then it has a homology decomposition, showing that its cone length, hence category, is at most the number of dimensions with nonzero (co)homology. Thus we can say $$ \mathrm{cat}(X) \leq \dim ( H^*(X;\mathbb{Q}). $$ More can be said with information about the distribution of the nonzero groups (if there's clumping). 

This example is wrong (sorry!): Try $(X,A) = (D^n, S^{n-1})$, $Y = D^n$, $f_A = \mathrm{in}_{S^{n-1}}$, and $B = Y$. Then we have plenty of nonequivalent (rel. $A$) maps $f, g: X\to Y$, and they all become equal in $Y/B = *$. Since $D^n$ is convex, any two maps $X\to D^n$ are homotopic by straight-line homotopies; and if the maps agree on some subset of $X$, the homotopy will be constant on that subset. 

Finite groups are solvable if they have no nontrivial perfect subgroup. But I am sure that for infinite groups, the two notions diverge. Is there standard terminology for groups with no perfect subgroups? 

Let $A$ be a suspension and $X$ be a space with Lusternik-Schnirelmann category $n$ and let $\alpha: A\to X$. It is easy to see that the cofiber $C_\alpha$ has $\mathrm{cat}(C_\alpha) \leq n+1$. One of the standard ways to decide if $\mathrm{cat}(C_\alpha)$ is actually equal to $n+1$ is to look at the Berstein-Hilton-Hopf invariants $H_\sigma(\alpha)$ for the various structure maps $\sigma:X\to G_n(X)$ witnessing the inequality $\mathrm{cat}(X)\leq n$. If $H_\sigma(\alpha) = *$ for any $\sigma$, then $\mathrm{cat}(C_\alpha) \leq n$. I know that examples are exist to show that the converse implication is false, but my list is very short: in fact, it is limited to the paper `Cogroups which are not suspensions' by Berstein and Harper (LNM 1370). Question/Request: Other examples of this phenomenon, especially references to examples in print. 

I suppose that the proof that $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ using covering spaces is homotopy-theoretic. The Freudenthal Suspension Theorem (via the James construction) tells us that $\Sigma: \pi_n(S^n)\to \pi_{n+1}(S^{n+1})$ is an isomorphism for $n \geq 2$ and surjective for $n =1$. Since $S^1$ is an H-space, the suspension map $\sigma: S^1\to \Omega\Sigma S^1$ has a retraction $r: \Omega\Sigma S^1\to S^1$. Therefore $\Sigma = \sigma_*: \pi_1(S^1)\to \pi_{2}(S^{2})$ is injective (in addition to being surjection). Now Freudenthal completes the calculation. Note that we don't just get an abstract isomorphism, we get that these groups are generated by $[\mathrm{id}_{S^n}]$.
