Hitler was baptised Catholic. Over whole his life he attended the services. He resused to change the faith and always said he was Catholic. Nevertheless, his faith was not that sincere. For example, he was aware that Catholic doctrine contradicts scientific facts (quote from Mein Kampf): 

The USA is the world's strongest country because of its military force. And it is the most advanced military force because it has the most advanced fundamental science. And it has the most advanced fundamental science because America inherited it from Germany which had been devastated. Germany was the most advanced nation since about 800 when Holy Roman Empire was formed. And in 1930s most German scientists just moved to the USA, similarly to how Roman scientists moved to Germany in 9th century. 

Contrary to what other answerers wrote, the actual situation was much stricter to Germany than after WWI. The basic fact is that post-WWII German government had no continuity with the pre-defeat one. Actually German state was completely demolished, and after a while, two new states were re-instituted. The founders of the new states were the occupying powers who gave German people only partial sovereignty over the territory. They installed the political systems they wished, putting the new governments under strict control and installing reliable people at the key positions. All hostile political forces were either prohibited or marginalized. The new army forces were re-created anew following the US and the USSR's model. The new states were forced into the pro-US and pro-Soviet military alliances, their militaries became dependent on the equipment and spare parts, produced in the host powers. In addition the occupying countries kept their armed forces stationed in Germany for many tens of years (and the US still keeps its military in Germany). There was just no possibility that Germany could spin out of control after WWII. 

To my impression this reflects systematic bias of the sources you use, possibly, sources circulating in your country and/or language. In the USSR, for example, there was no such glorification of the German generals, and many of the Soviet marshals and generals (such as Vasilevsky, Rokossovsky, Malinovsky, Konev, Meretskov) were well known. Today in Russia those Soviet generals are known far less, especially by the younger generation, but the German generals are not known better. 

Consider Sparta. In Sparta the king's (archagestes') term was 8 years. Upon its end, the ephores conducted a fortune-telling rite so to determine whether the gods were in favor of the term extension. 

After the war, many German films were shown in the USSR, popularly known as "trophy films", this included the 1944 "The Woman of My Dreams" which was shown until mid-1950s. At the same time the Soviets staunchly insisted on international ban on "Munchhausen". The official pretext I believe was that it showed Munchhausen to have an adultery with Russian empress Catherine the Great which was perceived as anti-Russian. But this is quite surprising given that 

Does this count? $URL$ It happened in Kiev, 2013. Or this: $URL$ In happened in St.Petersburg, 2013. 

Whele senators and ordinary civilians could justify a war with such considerations, the official pretexts for the wars were always different. All wars Rome conducted were officially motivated by international law. Particular motivations being: 

Kazan was taken with severe warfare. Crimea also was taken with sever hardships. Then we also have North Caucasus. 

The number of executions under Stalin varies between 642 980 (source: Zuyev M.N. 2002. History of Russia Vol. 2: p.230) (the internal report on the number of convicted to death penalty to Khrushchev for 1921-1954) and 827 995 (source: Pozdnov M. Death penalty in the USSR in 1937-1938) for the entire Soviet rule (1917-1990), of which the majority of executions happened in 1937-1938. 

I sometimes encounter accounts that the main reason why chemical weapons were not used in WWII was because initially they were invented by a Jew Fritz Haber, and as such Hitler expressed opinion that use of chemical weapons was inhumane and "Jewish" method of warfare. There were even some hints that the Nazis made certain propaganda canpaigns against use of chemical weapons which involved WWI war veterans who suffered from gas attacks. I wonder whether it is true that the Nazis regarded chemical weapons inhumane or was it only a propaganda disguise? 

we can see that in 1982-1988 there was actually a drop in oil production by Saudi Arabia while the USSR had the peak of oil production at the same time. Saudi Arabia increased production only after the production by the USSR dropped in the end of 1980s. So was not it actually the USSR who dropped the prices, and not Saudi Arabia? 

I believe, no. The USSR disintegrated due to different reasons. The US maybe played role in it but not through the means of SDI but most likely through propaganda and influence on the top party officials. 

It seems the most ancient limitations on the head of state's powers were of religious character: he should be honest and respect the gods, priests and rites. 

You should consider the Bosnian war (in Yugoslavia) in the 1990s, there were basically three factions fighting each other: the Orthodox Christian Serbs (Serbia), the Catholic Croats (Croatia) and the Slavic Muslims (Bosnia). The war was three-sided from 1992 to 1994, and two-sided in 1995-1996. You can see that even the table of belligerents in the Wikipedia lists three sides. 

British South Africa Company's Police, a police force of British South Africa Company over time became the national police force of South Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe). This force was first to use Maxim machine guns against natives which led to about 5000 casualties from the native side (with nearly no casualties from the corporate side). Going further in the past I think medieval Rome was a place that was policed by private forces of different clans at a time with some clans policing certain districts and some the others. A person could not visit the districts policed by an adversary clan. It should be noted however that state-hired private police in theory should differ from a private police hired by a private person or company. The main concern with privately-hired police force are as follows: 

An interesting fact was that Turkey actually proposed a tripartite alliance against German expansin at Balkans between Turkey, the USSR and Britain. They proposed to attack Germany in case they invaded Romania. But after Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was concluded such alliance became infeasible. The British proposed Turkey to make a bilateral treaty but Turkey replied that without USSR such alliance is worthless. Germany on the other hand strived to win Turkey in their alliance and exerted considerable pressure on her. For instance, they refused to ship the weapons purchased by Turkey from German plants and to return the paid money. As a result, Turkey was quite outraged, and the British shipped similar weapons to Turkey for free. 

There was no end goal of Nazi Germany but there was a end goal of Hitler for his lifetime. He wanted to conquer Lebensraum from the USSR and settle the area with Germans. He said that it would take 50 to 100 years for Germany to digest these territories, so this would far exceed his own lifetime. The territory after the conquest would resemble the USA settled by the British or Prussia formerly colonized by Teutonic knights. The indigenous peoples would either be totally eradicated, assimilated or locked in reservations like native Americans without the right to leave them, and provide Germans with what the Germans would demand. 

Where can I find an approximate chart of total mass of metallic gold in possession of humans by centuries starting with Neolithic? I also would like to see this detailed by civilization/culture. 

Jews were (and in many placed in East Europe still are) very much hated by the population mostly because it is believed that they are guilty in killing Jesus Christ. In Russian Empire for instance there were multiple bloody anti-Jewish pogroms. The only reason why the Jews were not killed by the non-Jewish population at the time was that the state mostly made efforts to protect the Jews or at least to limit the extent of hostilities. When the state power was becoming weak, the scale of hostilities usually rose dramatically. For example during Russian civil war about 200000 Jews were killed even though no party of the conflict officially endorsed extermination of the Jews. So once the state power completely changed their attitude from protecting the Jews or at worst, negligence to officially endorsing the killings and supporting that with additional propaganda efforts the effect was predictable. The already anti-Semitic population that in most cases was willing to kill the Jews even despite the resistance of the state, was intentionally further indoctrinated against Jews and any remaining restrains lifted. 

Where the country's name come from and when the country got this name, "Indonesia"? Was in given in 20th century? 

Try to consider Willy Lehmann. He was recruited in 1929, before Hitler came to power, initially for money, but when the War became expected to start, his collaboration became more ideological as he was strongly against it. He headed the Gestapo department that was doing counter-intelligence against Soviet industrial espionage. He transferred over a lot of very important info to the Soviets, that on German weapons, rocket technology, submarines, Gestapo cryptographic codes, and even the exact date for the invasion of the USSR. When the USSR had lost link to him, he conducted a risky step, and in 1940 put a letter into a post box of Soviet embassy calling for continued collaboration and said his work in Gestapo would lose any meaning if the USSR would not resume contacts. In 1941 after invasion of the USSR the connection with him was lost. In 1942 the Soviets tried to reestablish contact, but the Germans captured the sent communicators and executed Lehmann afterwards. 

Summing the above up, it can be said that through the whole period from Romulus to at least Heraclius 

It is unclear from your question what do you mean by "separated from the state". In fact European history knows only one theocratic state - the area under direct papal control centered in Rome, known at different periods as Papal states or Vatican. The rulers of all other European states were secular persons. Still the laws of many European states empathized Christianity as the state religion or Christian god as the source of power. In all European states the church performed some duties that now viewed as the duty of state. For example, the registration of births and marriages. But among population of different confessions these duties were performed by different religious bodies. For example, births and marriages among Jews were registered by Jewish religious organizations. I will list some events that may be relevant to your question. 

You can notice that the Latgalians, a Baltic ethnic group in Latvia were especially disliked by the Nazis due to their historically pro-Russian attitude. The Nazis even undertook special efforts to prove their racial impurity and inferiority As to the further plans, you should note that Hitler's attitude towards the Blacks, Asians and other peoples was much better than that towards the Slavs, the Jews and other Eastern Europeans. In general it seems the Reich would consider it their natural right to genocide any nationalities when the area is needed for Germans. Judging from the pattern which the Nazis established in their dealings with different ethnic groups, it is reasonable to assume that the Nazis would attempt 

Were there international Islamist movements before the US started supporting islamists during the USSR's war in Afghanistan? 

What you mean is not humanism by any definition. One can call it tolerance or pluralism. In ancient, polytheistic world it was quite common: people tended to believe that all deities worshiped by other peoples also existed. They were seen either as local deities or just other names for the already known deities. It was the spread of Abrahamic religions that required the people to struggle for the glory of a single god and to punish those who diverged from that line. So as far as influence of Christianity reduced, the tolerance returned back, naturally. 

Travelling as a tourist was not officially prohibited, but the thing was, you could not travel alone. You always should get an organized tour, with a guide etc. The main problem though was to get a tour voucher. It was easier for tours to Socialist countries, and much harder for tours to Capitalist countries. You also had to exel in something, usually at work to be awarded a tour, because the number allocated per organization was limited (and different for various enterprises). Possibly, there were also sold tours, but very expensive. Many people had access to the secret documents so they had no permission to travel (but were paid more for classified access). 

Most families had one or several bank accounts. Sometimes one account for a family was enough, but often older relatives (grandparents) wanted to keep money on their own accounts. 

They provide much better basic economic rights for the poor majority (right for shelter, right for employment, right for rest and recreation, free medicine and education etc) They restrict only such political activity that threatens the socialist system because they may lead to the abolishment of the above mentioned rights. 

How many legislature members there were who were not members of any party in the USA compared to the USSR during the Cold War and now? 

According to the new style. Even though the Revolution is called "October Revolution", it is celebrated in November, which may be confusing to some. The date of the Tsar's abdication is not celebrated and totally unknown to the masses. 

Before plastic, most of liquids were sold in paper containers or glass bottles (paper packs for liquids appeared in 20th century though). Solid food was sold in paper envelopes or boxes, metal boxes, foil or in natural envelopes (guts, leafs). Sometimes people were required to come with their own volumes to buy a liquid or a semi-liquid, with large quantities stored in wood/metal barrels. 

In Hitler's ideology exterminating Jews was the purpose and the goal of the war. The large-scale extermination started in 1942 when Germany's victory became uncertain. At that time Hitler had no longer possibility to postpone the extermination until the victory. 

I do not know what measure you use to determine technological advancedness, but it to speak about Italy, it was much more scientifically advanced than the Muslims up until renaissance when other European power such as France, England and Germany catched up. Just count the number of books published in Italy in in the Muslim world so to get rid of any illusions: this number was much higher for Italy even before printing press was invented. 

In Russian there is a similar convention. For example, we refer English monarchs by German-like names. I think the origin of this convention is pragmatism. Many monarchs changed their country by marriage. Some monarchs were sovereigns of two or more countries with different language. As such it is difficult to define the "true" ethnicity of many monarchs without offending other peoples. 

Perestroika is the continuation of work of the October [revolution]. The symbol of the October Revolution, Aurora cruiser is displayed.
