IRA bombings did increase Hibernophobia in Great Britain, as one would expect. John O'Beirne Ranelagh's "A Short History of Ireland" (Third Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2012. Page 217) makes mention of increased Hibernophobia being a result of IRA bombings during the lead-up to World War II: 

...so the Wikipedia page makes an assertion about a battle occurring, and cites as evidence a non-scholarly article on a commercial genealogy website which explicitly states there was no battle. Sure looks to me like a completely unsubstantiated (if not fabricated) claim. Certianly wouldn't be the only one on Wikipedia. 

I'm going to start by pointing out that people with stone age technology have been successfully inhabiting a very inhospitable climate (the Arctic) for thousands of years before the Age of Exploration.

In contrast to Frankfurt, Wiesbaden has many more buildings from the late 19th and early 20th century in the historicist, classicist, and even art nouveau style. These buildings are lovingly preserved and give this city a much more prosperous and traditional look than Frankfurt.

Whether one calls this "inspired by" or "based on" is secondary, I think. But of course, other influences such as Neue Sachlichkeit and the constructivism of artists such as El Lissitzky also played a part. (Compare Hunte's scene drawings to the art of El Lissitzky on the previous link.) The movie is sometimes mistakenly labeled "expressionist", but the expressionist era had already passed well into history by the time of its creation. Die Nibelungen was a huge project for the Ufa production company. Entire forests with thirty-foot trees were installed on the set. A seventy-foot dragon with humans inside to move its limbs was built. Lang and his staff spent three months just meeting to discuss creative decisions and technical planning for the film. If something was big, it was too small. Lang would not settle for anything short of monumental. Recently a restored and remastered copy of the film, based in part on recovered original camera stock, was released. It preserves the black-and-orange virage coloration and reintroduces some of the footage cut by the producers from part 2. A bloody saga of honor and loyalty, vengeance and downfall, which some critics have said prefigures National Socialism. Lang, however, hightailed it out of Germany as soon as Hitler had taken the reins of power. In a letter to film critic Lotte Eisner, he even hinted that the Huns who slaughter the decadent Burgundians may be an allegory for the proletariat overthrowing its oppressors. Parts of the film, with its human-operated dragon and obviously artificial scenery, may appear ludicrous to modern audiences weaned on Hollywood CGI productions. But as a historical document, it is without parallel. 

It seems that Americans were somewhat ambivalent about dueling. Many upper-class people participated in duels, but they were also considered an uncivilized practice. For instance, by the time Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, public opinion was largely against duels. See this article: $URL$ His duel with Hamilton helped doom Burr's political career, while later dueling was part of Andrew Jackson's fame and renown. 

Many Greek works of history and otherwise are gone. I suppose it's possible that the odd scroll or piece of information might be found, but it's not likely to ever fill in the gaps that exist. One example would be the Stoics. They are sometimes divided by time period into Early Stoa, Middle, and Late. Among those philosophers, little to nothing is known about many of the early leaders, people like Zeno, Cleanthes, or Chrysippus. Only newer Stoics like Seneca, Epictetus, or Marcus Aurelius are really known, at least relatively speaking since even they are not known very well. There are other examples of Romans or Greeks whose history or philosophy are lost. 

UPDATE: It turns out the story is a little more subtle and nuanced than retailed by Mr. Lebe and French Wikipedia. As yet I have not found an online copy of de Commynes' writings. What I have found is a Google e-book version of a 1984 monograph by Emile-Charles Varenbergh titled Mémoire sur Philippe de Commynes. While de Commynes may have been a loyal PR hack during his service for the Duke of Charolais, his writings published after Charles' death exhibit a much more reflective and at times wry tone regarding the exploits of his famous master. de Commynes recalls entering the service of the Duke as a young man in 1464. He quickly became his friend and confidante. The next year, the Duke rode into battle at the head of an army of "4,000 poorly armed and inept fighting men", with de Commynes always by his side. As the title of his memoirs -- Memoires de Commynes, ou Fragment de la comédie humaine -- indicates, the chronicler had an eye for the quirky and off-beat. He was a sharp observer of how the best-laid plans can go awry. The carefully thought-out battle plan at Montlhéry was soon thrown to the winds. The French King (Louis XI) had wanted to avoid conflict, yet the conflict took place. The Burgundians had planned on giving their infantry enough rest before the battle but in fact the men had had no rest, and in their eagerness to charge, they trampled over their own archers, giving the enemy time to retrench in safe positions. In any case the Burgundians profited from lack of discipline in their foes, enabling them to rout the enemy's right flank. But Charles, who had hurled himself almost alone at a large group of them, received a belly wound from a lance as well as a neck wound from a sword. Nightfall then separated the combatants, with the Burgundians camping on the battlefield. During the night, Charles counted his dead and wounded, expecting defeat if the enemy returned in the morning. Luckily for them, the King had beat a retreat during the night. Charles rejoiced in the victory and from that moment would never listen to advice again. On reading these descriptions, the word that comes to mind is "reckless" more than "bold". However -- I am now back to reading the French Wiki -- the first recorded instance of a chronicler calling Charles "The Bold" was not de Commynes': 

Even in the best case, "battle" is probably a very generous description of what happened... unless you consider criminals shooting at cops rather being arrested quietly a battle. More to the point, though, none of the more scholarly or reputable sources I've found make mention of anything like a battle occurring. And even more more damning, the page cited on Wikipedia as a footnote ("3") opens with: 

(Gerald of Wales, Giraldus, John Joseph O'Meara. "The History and Topography of Ireland". Penguin Classics, 1982. Page 102.) Hibernophobia has been so pervasive in English culture, that even supporters of the treaty that created the Irish Free State indulged in anti-Irish racism. (Paul McMahon. "British Spies and Irish Rebels: British Intelligence and Ireland, 1916-1945". The Boydell Press, 1988. Page 171.) All that being said, I'm not aware of any studies or books written specifically addressing the issue of the prevalence Hibernophobia in response to The Troubles. It seems rather like asking if Islamist terrorism has increased Islamophobia, or if the Civil War and reconstruction inflamed racist sentiment against African Americans in the United States. It's just taken as a given. Everything I've seen on the topic has approached it from the stance of debunking the idea that the IRA caused Hibernophobia, such as "Religion, Class, and Identity: The State, the Catholic Church, and the Education of the Irish in Britain" by Mary J. Hickman, which was referenced at the time by a UK paper under the subtitle "Anti-Irish racism is as old as the 12th century: it is not the result of IRA terrorism, says a study published yesterday." 

(The Duke's forceful personality, which all the chroniclers describe as austere, virtuous and pitiless, pious and chaste, animated by an acute sense of honor, moved his contemporaries to attach to him a number of epithets: they nicknamed him The Daring, The Bellicose, even The Bold (le Téméraire), a term one encounters as early as 1484 in the writings of Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux.) Nonetheless -- French Wiki continues -- none of the 15th-century chroniclers consistently employ any of these epithets. Instead, "Charles de Bourgogne" is what he was typically called. Today we know him as Charles the Bold, but the changeover in the name was slow and gradual. In the 17th century, the Grand Dictionnaire Historique de Louis Moreri devotes an entry to Charles de Bourgogne, "nicknamed le Guerrier, le Hardi ou le Téméraire" (the Bellicose, the Daring, the Bold.) In the 18th century, Benedictine historian Dom Plancher still calls him Charles le Hardi. In the 19th century, during the Romantic Age in France and Belgium the epithet "Charles the Bold" took hold... but his 15th-century contemporaries more frequently had attached to him the nicknames Hardi, Travaillant, Guerrier, even Terrible. SUMMARY: The earliest recorded use of Téméraire to characterize Charles was in 1484 by Thomas Basin. Other epithets stuck to him more closely for a long time. It was not until the 19th century that Téméraire finally became the standard appellation. Why did this appellation stick and not one of the others? The cause is probably lost in the mists of history. However, given that an ancestor -- Philippe II de Bourgogne -- was already known as "le Hardi", it may have been due to a simple desire by historians to avoid any mix-up between the two. 

There are almost too many examples to cite(the Austrian school of economics, Sigmund Freud, modernist figures in culture, Joseph Schumpeter, etc.). Here's a quote from Wikipedia's Vienna entry: 

My question is this: What stood out about Vienna that made it such a hotspot in so many different ways? 

George Washington had in total about 300 slaves at the height of his slave-owning career, but only about 150 were directly his, the others being indirectly his since they were acquired through family connections and so on. I think Martha Washington brought many or maybe most of them to the marriage--a lot of George's wealth (land, etc.) came from marrying Martha. In his will, Washington freed the approximately 150 slaves that were his to free. The others were not legally his, so he couldn't. That he, as a Virginia landowner and wealthy individual, did this was rather unusual and is noteworthy. My source for this is Ron Chernow's "Washington: A Life." Here's an interview about the book where he mentions the above numbers of slaves: $URL$ In other words, George Washington was far from the worst master a slave could have had. He was very much invested in the slave-owning soclal order that put him at the top of the food chain, but he did recognize slaves in a more humane way, as being more than live property like horses or hunting dogs. The interview above talks about Washington's feelings toward his slaves--demanding, but not wholly inhumane. 

The purpose of a game is to provide entertainment for the players, not to teach history. So if it is historical accuracy you are after, you won't find it in games. The next step up is shows like National Geographic or the History Channel, but they cater to the lowest common denominator and grossly oversimplify things for their audience. So what you should do is visit your Public Library and get to know the librarian, ask her for recommendations and advice. Others would disagree with me and say No, go to Wikipedia, or Barnes and Noble, or your local university. The main thing is to seek out knowledgeable people willing to listen to your questions and answer with advice appropriate to you. In my experience, such advice is easier to get in person than over the Internet. Beware of Youtube, it's chock full with completely insane conspiracy mongering by hateful, twisted people.
