I've entered a 100 Mile Cycling Sportive (that takes place in July 4 months to train) I intend to ride it on a singlespeed (non fixed gear) road bike. (with a gear ratio of 43-16) This will be the second century ride I've done, but the first real distance I've done on singlespeed. I love the challenge and the simplicity of singlespeed riding so please no answers advising using a geared road bike. I currently train a progressive overload hypertrophy/strength 5 day split, and also go for a 30+ mile cycle on each Sunday. A rough outline of my routine is below please note, not all excercises/warmups/warmdowns/stretches are listed. 

Your doctor probably advised swimming primarily as its great for mobility and is low impact. Stretching, extension and flexion of the muscles/joints will be infinitely better for you than slouching/hunching over for extended periods. With regard to the breaststroke the extension (glide) portion of the stroke would be practically impossible to do while trying to pin your scapula back. The only time you may feel it pull back is if you do an underwater stroke from your turns as the glide underwater is the only time the head should be below the streamlined arms (should be around forehead level in normal strokes) the pull aspect of the stroke will likely be working your mid/lower back, shoulders and lats and you will naturally retract the shoulder blades as when your head comes out of the water your back will arch upwards slightly. but i don't think you need to over emphasise this as it may impede your stroke. You might benefit from a few pointers from a swim coach if you only know breaststroke at the moment. As swimming with proper technique will blow your mind how streamline a human can become in the water. Freestyle and backstroke are also wonderful strokes to learn also. (perhaps not butterfly at this time) If i was you i'd advise stick to enjoying your swimming and new found health benefits from improved posture. All the best *Source - over a decade of being a competitive swimmer * 

In my opinion, those head straps look kinda dorky. but you could try it, if you don't want to buy one you could always make one with a small plate, rope and a headband or vest tied around your head etc. Maybe you could use resistance bands somehow? Generally stretches and mobilty work will do wonders, things like Neck rotation, extension/flexion, chin tuck. Head lift/crunch Also Mike Tyson famously had a huge neck and trained it with exercises like the neck roll/neck bridge, but if you attempt this please be VERY careful and maintain strict form as you can seriously injure yourself. Making sure you hit traps well on back day is very important as it will help support the back of your neck and keep your spine protected. 

Currently I feel my cns can take quite a good beating and currently day to day I'm not fatigued and generally recover well. My nutrition is generally good - Lots of protein lots of nutrient rich vegetables and lots of low gi carbs, and I also get plenty of sleep each night. I also supplement the following: 

I also fuel properly while cycling long distances (one water bottle & one gel per hour on average depending on intensity/outside wind/temperature) My question is this. How can I effectively incorporate cycling training into my current routine to enable me to comfortably complete the 100 mile sportive? For instance: Should I increase frequency of cycling and reduce time in gym? should I increase time in gym but focus on including cardio? Should I keep gym the same but add additional cycling training? Should I alter my low rep high load strength focused training to hi rep low weight endurance based approach? Should I rest more/less? Will my work in the gym improve or hinder lactate threshold? Should my long ride be spaced further away from squat day to increase recovery time? etc etc. Also any tips on climbing steep gradients on singlespeed are welcomed :) Thanks for your time. 

If you're trying to get a muscular physique in your home gym than you might encounter several problems. The most common being: 

In both cases West-to-East and East-to-West jet lag does apply (not north and south / south and north). Basically your body and brain are completely out of sync due to the departure time and arrival time when travelling through different time zones. I strongly suggest arriving a few days (atleast 3, some people prefer 1 week) earlier before your marathon. This will get your body adjusted to sleeping at the correct American / European times respectively. 

Switch up your diet if needed. Paleo diet is great, but have you tried anything else? If you're looking to burn fat through your cardio, try to stay in a rythme where you'll be able to hold a conversation with someone without being out of breath. When you find that fine line, you'll get better results from the fat loss department. As for the weights, if you've only been doing weights maybe it's time to try plyometric exercises. I suggest talking to a personal trainer. Remember ... Even if you're not losing weight, perhaps your losing fat but building muscle at the same time which won't change your current weight. 

Before training (age 18) I was a scrawny 18 year old. My friends were for the most part, the same age as me. It was very intimidating for me to start training (being very weak) with my best buddies who have been working out for 2 years and getting a nice physique as well as strength. It was very hard for my ego, this can be different for each person. Of course, when I did start, they were very helpful (as anyone would be) and added just the right amount of teasing to push me harder. Important note: I started seriously when I was out there to prove to myself what I could acheive and not to my friends. This is often the cause for people quitting working out. Now I encourage everyone I can if they have the will power. This is a key factor because not everyone will start with the same motivation. You almost can't make someone start at the same level of intensity as you (unless they have a huge ego). Many people will be discouraged before they even start to see results. For added motivation, I suggest everyone I know to take progress pictures so that they can really see their achievement. This helps them stay motivated and push even harder. 

How important is condition in such an event? Spartan Sprint A 5-7km race with 12 obstacles can take between 1-2 hours with average conditioning. Super Spartan A 12-15km race with 20 obstacles can take about 2-4 hours with average conditioning. It all depends on what kind of results you're expecting for the race ... Do you wish to finish first or simply finish for the sake of completing the race? The people who finish first in these races are very well conditioned with multiple years of training for this specific type of race. In any case, good luck on the race, AROO! 

Home Exercise Training Here are some (beginner) exercises that I provide some of my clients with who train at home. The following will include links of how-to's, videos, and images that show you which body part you will train. The descriptions in the links provided help a lot. They explain thoroughly and have helped me complete some of my exercises. Note: I wasn't sure if you had a bench so I tried including exercises which didn't have any benches 

I have used C4 quite a bit along side with Creatine as well. Depending on your creatine, C4 won't be giving you that much creatine (I believe it was 1g per scoop). Some people claimed creatine needed a "loading phase" but that hasn't been proven. In fact, the "loading phase" was popularized by companies who wanted to sell more of their product. They would suggest a loading phase and the consumer would be using more during the first weeks (without any added results). 

Its a great way to build muscle, muscles don't know how much weight they are pushing, they only know they are being forced agaisn't resistance which is enought to grow muscles as long as there is progress. Progress can be made by increasing frequency, weight, repetitions, sets, speed, time under tension or by decreasing rest between sets. Growth requires muscles to be fatiqued and broken down which can be done with light and heavy weights. Nervous system strength requires heavy weight. If you don't care about getting stronger its fine, why would you care after all... it bring no functionality in real life to bench press 3 times your weight. Or are you a mechanic who plans on bench pressing cars to change their oil? 

Has anyone tried hanging from a bar with a dumbbell between the legs and trying to do leg curls? For leg/knee raises it works fine, I'm asking cause I don't want to injure myself in the gym while experimenting exercises. For people who tried it, does the dumbbell between legs work? if not are there better alternatives, like maybe using bands as resistance or using dipping belts with plates... Edit: So I tried it by myself,the dumbbell between legs only works with small dumbbells. 10 kilograms at max With the dipping belt it works fine with the plate behind the back and allows to use the most weight, but it doesn't give any resistance in the bottom part of the exercise and after a while either the grip or the trapezius get too fatigued to keep doing the exercise. Bands are by far the best as they be placed in different ways and still work, but again has the same limitations of the dipping belt. 

What exercises can be done anywhere with no equipment, not even a bar for the upper back muscles and is as easy to learn as a bodyweight push up. 

We know that individual muscles cells can either be fully active to their greatest potential or completely off, there's no such thing as partial activation. We also know that strength training recruits more muscle fibers at a time depending on the force needed, that's why larger muscles are usually stronger, think glutes vs biceps. Muscle growth usually happens by muscle cells getting bigger from being put under tension. So my question is : Do big muscle cells output more force than small muscle cells or are they just more resistant to stress? This is not related to other questions like ''how does muscle size relate to strength'' or ''are bigger muscles stronger'' because those questions are usually about the entire muscles, while this one is about the individual muscle cells and anyway most of the answers are just ''reps in the range of X build strength and reps in the range of X build muscle''. 

Weight loss Weight loss comes from eating less calories than your body needs. If a 90 kg man needs 3000 calories to maintain his fat then he needs to eat 2800 calories to lose around 0.2 kilograms a week. The most commonly used method is to eat 200-500 calories less than needed. Muscle building Progressive overload is the name of the game The body builds bigger muscle to withstand stress, bigger stress=bigger muscles. If your muscles are not growing then try increasing the sets,repetitions,weight,speed,time under tension or the rest between sets. Since you asked about which rep range to do, The truth is that it really doesn't matter for muscle building. Low reps build strength and muscle while high reps build endurance and muscle, it all comes down to preference. Biological law of accommodation If you keep giving your body the same type of stress over and over again you will eventually plateau in all senses be it endurance,muscle building or strength, once you plateau if you don't implement any kind of Periodization you will totally stall or worse become weaker and lose muscles because the body no more adapts to stress but ''accommodates'' itself to stress. People who never did any physical activity in their entire life might be able to train for 1 or 2 years without experiencing any stall. Keep changing exercises every 2-3 weeks and use a variety of exercises to avoid plateaus. Example : Bench press> Weighted dips> Weighted push up> Repeat
