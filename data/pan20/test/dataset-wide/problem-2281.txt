Wrote about the itinerary we followed: Agumbe trek. Might help. EDIT 2: I've added additional info on the possibility of forest fires in the western ghats. 

Source RA stands for reduced altitude, SL stands for sea level, HA for high altitude These sources are interesting as these mention that the hypoxic tents might actually not cause any improvement in acclimatisation or retaining of acclimatisation that's gained using actual altitude. To conclude, it's really hard to say that Hypoxic tents will help you to acclimatise any better than being at a higher altitude. The science and the studies are divided themselves. There's no concrete yes or no as of now on this. Here are a few links for further reading: 

I follow the idea of leaving as less a trace as possible. So what I do is to reuse the cathole. The problem with multiple catholes is how much damage it does to the landscape (especially if the ground is covered with grass). And anyway, it goes without saying that once you are done with your business you'll put some soil into the cathole to reduce the smell and thereby reduce the possibility of animals getting attracted :). 

The rucksacks that I own, have extra long straps as well. But the manufacturer has provided an elastic band of sorts on the straps to fold them and tuck them within the band (I'll try to post a pic once I get back home). Another option that I have tried is to tuck these longer straps into the side pockets (water bottle holders) and even tie up a lose knot of sorts on themselves to prevent huge swaying straps. Personally I have never faced any issues as such with longer straps (They don't tend to get stuck up somewhere). It's more of a mental state where I feel the longer straps are kind of a nuisance. 

I wouldn't recommend gaining 3700+ meters in 2 days. It's not about fitness. It's just about how well your body adapts to altitude. I agree that 3700 meters is not too high to get severely sick due to AMS, but then, it's not recommended to gain more than 1000 meters of vertical distance per day. Also, I know friends who have suffered from altitude sickness at as low as 8000 feet (2500m approx). Things to keep in mind: 

A couple of years ago, we hiked up to a place in the western ghats during the month of December (end of it). Which is actually the end of winter in the Indian subcontinent. The biggest problem we faced (unanticipated) was the shortage of water. The streams there had already dried up. The forest guide took us deep into the forest and due to his native knowledge, he knew where to find water (it was a super slow moving 5-6 inches deep stream, so it hardly made any running water sound). Makes me wonder if there are features or things I can look for in a thick tropical forest that can guide me towards a stream of water. This question speaks of finding water in dry wilderness. However, I'm looking specifically towards thick rain forests. 

When I participated in a couple of forest surveys in the Indian subcontinent, I was strongly advised by the forest officials to keep away from anything which would give off a strong scent (deodorants, soaps included). The reason being, many animals are inquisitive and are attracted to strong smells. Bears, I believe are no exceptions. Hence yes, bears do get attracted to all the scented items you have mentioned in the question. 

For me, as a thumb rule, when on high altitude treks, I do not go for any food which is digestion intensive. i.e, any food which required a lot of oxygen to get digested is not favorable. You can always have chocolate bars/energy bars at higher altitudes. Herbal tea is something that keeps you hydrated and gives you decent amount of caffeine at the same time. The locals/sherpas would probably recommend garlic soups as well. I'm not entirely sure of the scientific significance of the same. Since you are a pure vegetarian, and since you need good amount of carbs and proteins, the following should give you the required nutrition: 

Most of the times, sow bears try to avoid conflict as it can lead to its cubs being killed. Bears with cubs turn aggressive only when they feel that they cannot escape (A person being too close or the bear being startled by an unsuspecting human). This behavior is not specific to types of bears or even seasons or age of the cubs. This continues to be the behavior till the cubs leave the mother (typically after around 2 years). Sometimes the search for food might cause a sow bear to wander near to the human settlements or an unsuspecting camper. Still, the rules of attack are mainly guided by whether it can escape with the cubs or it has to fight for the survival of the cubs. Always remember that winter seasons, though a time for hibernation, cannot guarantee a sow bear to be docile(In fact, bear hibernation is not a pure hibernation and is called as winter lethargy. And hence it can wake up much faster than true hibernators). It's always better to keep distance from a bear with cubs irrespective of season/age of the cubs/type of bear. 

There's absolutely no reason why a guitar string can't be used for rabbit snares. In fact, I've seen rabbit snares which match the same thickness and quality as the guitar strings (these were illegal poacher traps that we dismantled). All you need to catch a rabbit is a snare that the rabbit can get into but can't get out of. The bass strings would be much easier to prepare a snare with, while the treble ones might be a bit more difficult to work with to prepare the snare (more slippery and less malleable). Apart from that, no other reason why they couldn't be used. As to why he doesn't use, it might depend on how good the rabbit population is in that area and how big they are too (guitar string is limited in length after all). 

The idea is to strengthen your core (mostly your abs) to allow for your body to not offload the whole weight on the back. 

Recently I saw a podcast of Alex Honnold with Rich Roll where Alex speaks about deliberately eating up and gaining weight before going on an Antarctic expedition (I'm assuming this is because of the climate as well as his lack of body fat as a climber). Made me wonder if this is a tactic used by trekkers as well. In case I'm going on long hikes (10 days or more), is it advisable to eat up and deliberately put on more weight before the treks? I'm a fit male who has very less fat percentage. Eating more to put on might be a way to offset the loss of weight that'll happen over longer treks. Note: This is not a hypothetical question. I'll be hiking for around 2 months in the Himalayas and it'll be a long strenuous two months. I am expecting to lose some weight for sure. I'm wondering if I can offset this with some weight gain before I head off. 

Source Here, HH stands for Hypobaric Hypoxia (Altitude based reduction in oxygen) and NH (Normobaric Hypoxic, tent based reduction in oxygen). There's also a study of if at all the acclimatisation that was gained using altitude would be retained by using tent based acclimatisation (The reverse of what you are asking). And here's an excerpt from the study: 

Disclaimer - The answer is purely based on research. I've personally only been up to 6400m and have never used an altitude tent to acclimatise. Background of altitude acclimatisation: With increase in altitude, the barometric pressure decreases. This means, there's less amount of air. However, the percentage of Oxygen in itself remains the same (21%). This implies that there's lesser air to breathe, and in turn, lesser Oxygen to intake. To mitigate this, the body produces more red blood cells to absorb more Oxygen (also the reason why blood gets thicker at altitude). This is one of the ways body mitigates the thinner air in the atmosphere at altitude. The science of altitude acclimatisation itself is ill developed. There are hundreds of studies but nothing is set in stone. Altitude tents (Hypoxic tents) Hypoxic training is very common among athletes. However, there's a very important difference between hypoxic training as compared to altitude acclimatisation. When it comes to hypoxic tents, the air thickness remains the same but the percentage of oxygen is reduced. This is a way to simulate the lesser Oxygen that's found at higher altitude. However, this is not the same as high altitude. At altitude, the air itself is thinner. Theoretically, a hypoxic tent should be simulate the same effect as a high altitude stay. However, there are quite a few studies that suggest otherwise. 

The quick answer to a question of credible sources for solo trekking trails is, "NO", there are no sources which can be completely relied on for this kind of information (at least for the western ghats part). The following set of attributes might help you in deciding upon heading out solo in the western ghats: Safety: The western ghats are safe for trekking. I haven't come across any trail which can be classified as "dangerous" in terms of the danger from robbers/people etc. However, some trails are relatively riskier than others (eg Agumbe trek) due to the naxal threats. Poachers are a danger in densely forested trails(But I guess you are not venturing into these). There is very little threat from animals while on the well established trails. Off beat trails around thick forests are riskier due to elephants, snakes and poachers. Summers have an additional threat of forest fires. The forest departments do put up the fire lines. However, as the recent incident indicated, the grasslands are susceptible to large scare forest fire and can cause fatal injuries. Grade of treks: Most of the well established treks in the western ghats are of easy-moderate difficulty. The only one that I consider mildly difficult is "Kumara Parvata". Accessibility: All the treks in the western ghats are accessible through a nearby town/village. These places are cost effective and people are very welcoming. The chances of being coned are lesser than what you would find in the northern part of India. When to trek the western ghats? Do not venture during monsoon and summer. Summer heat is intensified by the thick forest cover and monsoons are just uncomfortable due to the heavy rainfall. Camping and other facilities: On some of the trekking spots, camping is not allowed. This is mainly because these spots lie in the range of a reserve forest or a sanctuary. Some of the trails might require you to get a permit from the forest department to even enter the trails. Some trails might require guides. Water, although available in the form of streams is not completely reliable. A better option would be to carry water purifying filter. None of the trails have facilities in terms of proper camping sites. It's entirely up to you how you setup your campsite. Exit routes Always remember, in case you get into trouble(either due to an injury or an animal attack), the exit routes on western ghats are difficult. Two reasons:
