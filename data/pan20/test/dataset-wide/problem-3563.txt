The short Answer: It is safe to do cardio daily. The use of "intense" really depends on your body. If you build up your routine by starting with 20 minutes of running daily and then the week after 30, 40, etc. eventually getting to an "intense" cardio workout, then it is fine. Throwing yourself into an intense routine every day without the build up may cause certain muscles or joints to have a hard time keeping up. Example: I play basketball in the summertime as my form of cardio to lean up. I start with 1-3 days a week, for 1-2 hours. At first, my knees will be a bit sore after playing, and by week 3-4 I am at 5+ days a week, minimum 2 hours a day without soreness. With cardio (as with many things), the more you do it the better you get at it. It is all about pace (moving up at your body's rhythm) and just being attentive to what your body needs. If you feel you need a day off, take one, but it isn't necessary to do so for cardio. Just make sure your diet and rest reflect the work you are going to be doing (providing your body with the nutrition it needs to keep up). 

All of these thing make me wary about training for Couch to 5k three times per week. I do wish to run marathon in few years. How is it to do 

They say do Dynamic Stretching before run. Will train for Couch to 5K. Is Surya Namaskar considered Dynamic Stretching? Or are there other Dynamic Stretches to do in addition to Surya Namaskar? 

I have to rest from exercise at least once a week. Maybe twice, but hope to make it just once a week. Can we do dynamic / static stretch those days. Especially if we have have joint stiffness, i.e hip stiffness. Thank you 

Lady in late 30s, wishes to train for Spartan Race to compete in about two years (slow and steady wins the race) Currently I can 

Well it looks like you have your exercise portion of things in order. Running and going to the gym regularly is for sure helping, but here is your main problem: 

As commented by others, without seeing a video of your form or knowing a bit more information it is hard to say if you are doing proper form 100%. Even then, sometimes what one person feels is proper form and causes 0 pain, someone else might have a different reaction. I find this true especially with squats. You might want to pay attention to how straight your back is, the direction of your legs / knees, and how low you go before you might feel the discomfort. I found an article which elaborates on this: 

I'm not sure if I should post here, or on Hinduism forum, as it is Yoga and Power workout. I have been doing Surya Namaskar in the morning. I am comfortable at 30 rounds. But according to tradition, they say reach to 108. Just now, I read this article, $URL$ which touts the 108 repetitions. But I get confused with the following 

I understand that one set of Surya Namaskar is a set of identical exercises, working the left and right sides of the body. So I guess someone can count one set of Surya Namaskar as two rounds, i.e. 

Please recommend more dynamic stretches that improve hip mobility. That will open up the hips. Also recommend other dynamic exercise for running, esp for couch to 5K. 

You have inherited genetic material from your parents and this predisposes you to certain modern ailments like Type-2 Diabetes , that is you are more likely to get it, let's say compared to someone who is lean and there is no family history of diabetes. But what I want to stress on is that it's just a probability and doesn't have to be your fate. You get to have the final say because food and lifestyle can drastically reduce this possibility. Remember, food is bio-chemical information and impacts the bio-chemistry of our bodies. Good luck. Nitin 

By giving a large time gap between your last meal of the day and first meal of the next day, what will your brain and body be running on? We can only store 100 gms or so as liver glycogen, that can be used by the brain (muscle glycogen is actually not used to power the brain). The most logical answer is your body will become fat adapted. Your body will up-regulate the machinery to metabolize fat and your mitochondria should get more effective at burning fat. Add to that the fact that meal that you do eat are not sugary, processed carb types. You are sending a signal to your body again to get better at using fat as fuel and become an efficient fat burner. 

Help, I am really confused. Do they mean make 54 sets, i.e. 108 repetitions, or 108 sets? I am thinking they mean 54 sets (i.e. one set around the Sun), but now I'm not too sure. 

I am training to circumumbulate Mount Kailash, 32 miles of mountain terrain nearly 18,000 feet above sea level. And I understand this will take years! Training is 5 days a week, Monday and Thursday are rest days. One of the exercises I am doing is backward lunge. I am at 4 reps, 1 set. For few days I was happy doing this exercise, now it is causing pain on right knee (started late yesterday morning). This morning when I woke up, I am unable to do this, or other bending exercises, including Surya Namaskar (I'm at 72 reps, 12 yoga poses each!) Now I have to wait a few days till I get better. Please give alternate exercise to Backward Lunge. Perhaps I can do this till my knees are strong enough to do both Backward and Forward Lunge. Thank you. 

Trying to understand your question, you state that there is a nutritional plan with p90x but you don't want to follow it because: 

So all we can really suggest (unless being a nutritionist and making you a complete plan specifically for your needs) is to: 1 - Replace any foods you have no access to with other foods of similar nutritional value. 2 - Don't be lazy. If you need to prepare meals / snacks for the day to achieve the proper nutritional / caloric intake, then do it. There are no shortcuts to a proper diet or putting on muscle. I try and cook for 2-3 days worth of work lunches and snacks at a time and make it part of my routine / schedule to keep up with my nutritional program. You can still eat meals with your family, but you may need to prepare some stuff individually to eat with them while they eat their food, or change your plan to accommodate the different foods you will be eating. But most importantly, if you're going to put in the time to do the workout, you mind as well put in the time to do the nutrition side of things or you will not be getting the desired results. Diet is key in any change in physique. Good luck with your program! 

Good news is that you have realized early enough that you could be in danger of type 2 diabetes and you may already be in fact a bit insulin resistance. I have been able to reverse my dad's pre-diabetes purely by controlling his diet. I have also been able to improve blood lipid markers for my elder brother. Here are my suggestions and recommendations 

You can then do a simple body-fat% check over a year to prove that you have indeed become an efficient fat burner. What I have learnt is that sometimes it's just easier to do an experiment of N=1 rather than rely on a clinical trial. When I eat a piece of cake loaded with gluten, I know how crappy I feel for a few hours - the brain fog. I no longer need an extensive clinical trial to convince me that gluten is a problem with x% of the population. 

Whether your goal is to gain muscle, strength, or endurance, it is always better to do your exercises together (with short breaks between sets) than spaced throughout the day. In general, 3 sets of one exercise won't actually give you any noticeable changes in strength or endurance. You need to do more. You can try adding some exercises that would help your swimming stroke such as the Plank Row, Kettle Bell Swing, and Medicine Ball Pushup, too. Alternatively, This Site also has quite a few good exercises for arms, directed more towards swimming - most of which would be transferable to tennis as well. A good 4-5 exercises per workout for 3-4 sets would be ideal. But in your case, your best bet is to also do more swimming. If your goal is ultimately strength in your arms for swimming, then just do a lot of it! Swimming is a great workout for your entire body, including your arms. 

Sitting all the time at work is obviously bad but standing at just one angle isn't super great. So, rather than just standing, give your body some variation. Break monotonous standing with sitting. Don't just stand, take a quick 5 minute walk. 

Understand the connection between food you may be eating and how it's impacting your insulin hormone and blood sugar levels. Remember, type 2 diabetes is essentially insulin resistance which means body is no longer sensitive to insulin. This is primarily a result of eating highly refine carbs and sugars. I would recommend you read Mark Sisson's article: $URL$ Once you understand the above basics, don't take anything on faith but take matters in your own hands by buying a glucometer. It's very cheap and will help you monitor your blood glucose levels. Read my experiment on how I measured my blood glucose for a week: $URL$ Also google for "Chris Kresser glucometer" and you can read a wonderful post on how you can prevent diabetes and heart disease for 16 bucks. Once you know your 101, you can have a meaningful chat with your GP. You will be able to take an informed decision and not just blindly follow what the doc asks you to do. 

I've always had knee problem did lot of knee strengthening as a kid/ adult Did hours on stationary bike on and off throughout teen and early adult years. Not athletic. Only in past year I was able to build up to 108 Surya Namaskars, plus do little stationary bike and lifting 10, 15 lbs at home. Currently dealing with hip tightness (posted separate thread) Lady, will turn 37 in few days, 146lbs, 5'4", excess belly fat 

I believe it's ok, but wanted to cross reference. Is it ok to exercise twice a day, 12 hours apart if say, you know next day you will not have chance to exercise? In this case I'd do low-impact cardio (like jogging instead of jumping jacks and ghost jump ropes), and I'd work a different muscle group. Any insights, past experiences?
