And as Williams shows above, in 55 VLFBERHT swords, accuracy in spelling (i.e., +VLFBERH+T) is positively correlated with the quality of the blade; the swords inscribed +VLFBERH+T are the highest quality, and the swords whose inscriptions deviated most from this spelling were also the lowest quality. 

+VLFBERH+T: 46-51 known examples +VLFBERHT+: 18-23 known examples VLFBERH+T: 4-6 known examples +VLFBERH+T+: 1-2 known examples +VLFBERIIIT: 10 known examples +VLEBERHIT, +VLFBEHT+, +VLFBERH+, +VLFBERIIIT, +VLFBERTH: 17 known examples Non-definable: 31-32 known examples 

I have studied the holocaust in some depth, and I am familiar with the repulsive ideological reasons for the Nazis' persecution of Jews, Poles, Slavs, Communists, etc, but I haven't seen any explanation for their similar policies regarding Jehovah's Witnesses. Obviously, eugenics and race had nothing to do with it, and I'm not clear on what political problems would be attributed to JW's. Why did the Nazis target Jehovah's Witnesses? 

It was surprisingly common for highly respected, extremely visible, and incredibly famous figures to be outspoken anti-Semites. Examples include aviator Charles Lindbergh; radio host, Catholic priest, and political commentator, Father Charles Coughlin; and industrial tycoon Henry Ford. Ford was one of Hitler's idols, and the FÃ¼hrer kept an autographed photo of Ford in a prominent position in his office. Ford is now notorious for saying things like: 

It became a religion of the book very early on in its history. This made it mobile. A single preacher could travel to communities he thought would be receptive, have someone make a copy of the text, and then move on to the next town. 

I'm not a scholar, but I am auditing courses in the subjects of Early Christology, Patristic Theology, Textual Criticism of the Bible, Biblical Hermeneutics, the History of the Early Church, and the History of the New Testament at Princeton Theological Seminary. I also audited courses in the same subjects at Union Theological Seminary. I think there were several factors that predisposed Christianity1 to rapid, widespread growth, beginning with a scattered pattern.. My Understanding of the Factors that Led to the Rapid Rise of Christianity: 

In the year 66 CE, the Jews in Roman Palestine rose up in revolt against the Roman occupation. Four years later , the Romans sacked Jerusalem, leveled the city, killed everyone inside, razed the Temple to the ground, and carted off the holy relics as spoils of war. 

The Rise of Christianity, Chapter I: Conversion and Christian Growth' Rodney Stark, p. 13 The 40% per decade trend ended around 350 CE, because there simply weren't enough people for the trend to continue - if it had, there would have been nearly 190 million Christians in the Empire by the year 400 CE, which would be more than three times the total population of the Empire. Suffice to say that by 400, or 450 at the latest, virtually everyone in the Empire was Christian. Today, there are well over a billion Christians in the world, and no religion has ever been so influential in shaping the course of human events, for better or worse. From Wikipedia: 

I've found many other instances of atrocity propaganda making these claims, but the examples above are sufficient to illustrate what I'm talking about. As far as I've been able to determine, none of the accusations above are considered to be accurate by modern scholars. What is our earliest record of propaganda mentioning enemy forces impaling infants and cutting fetuses from women's wombs? 

The British decision to create "Pals Battalions" of men from a single town or village led to unanticipated disasters when Pals battalions ran into heavy resistance, with large numbers of men from a single town or village being killed in a single day. Which town or village lost the greatest percentage of its men in such a disaster? 

According to the terms of the Versailles Treaty at the end of the First World War, Germany's military was limited to a force so tiny as to be utterly irrelevant in any major conflicts. When Hitler came to power, he began to rebuild the military in secret, in direct contravention of the Treaty. When and how did the larger portion of the German population learn that their country had a massive, well equipped, and powerful military again? Hitler's saber rattling and belligerence in the years leading up to the war terrified many of his citizens, to say nothing of his potential adversaries, but this would likely have been true regardless of whether or not the full scale of the rearmament was public knowledge. I imagine that, some time around the invasion of Poland, Hitler must have revealed his achievements, whether the revelation was intended to intimidate his enemies or reassure his subjects. 

As a result of the split within the ranks of the IRA, a disastrous civil war ensued, in which more lives were lost than had been lost in the war of independence. The rival factions were labeled "Pro-treaty" (or "Treatyites") and "Anti-treaty" forces. Do we have any contemporary evidence of popular opinion in the Irish Free State regarding the treaty? 

The first problem with this account is that it claims that the reigns of Herod in Judaea, Quirinius in Syria, and Augustus in Rome coincided. In reality, they did not. Herod died in the year 4 CE, and was succeeded by his son Archelaus. Archelaus proved to be an incompetent and brutal King, and the Roman authorities quickly removed him from office in the interest of preventing unrest. In the year 6 CE, therefore, Archelaus was deposed, and Judaea became a province of the Roman Empire, under direct control of a proconsul, overseen by the Governor of Syria, who was, at that time, Quirinius. When Judaea was made a province, the Emperor ordered Quirinius to conduct a census for the purpose of taxation. The historical record, Luke notwithstanding, shows that the census occurred in the same year Archelaus was deposed, 6 CE, two years after Herod's death. Luke's Misunderstanding of Geographical and Political Issues: Luke claims that the census occurred in Judaea, and that Joseph was required to leave Nazareth and go to Bethlehem to be registered for taxation. This is a significant problem, because Nazareth is in Galilee, not Judaea. When Judaea became a province of the Roman Empire, Galilee remained unaffected by the annexation, as a semiautonomous client state. From 4 CE to 39 CE, Galilee was ruled by Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great; he was deposed by Emperor Caligula in 39, and Galilee was incorporated into Judaea in the year 44 CE, a few years after Jesus' death. This brings us to the point: A census in Judaea would have no bearing on Joseph and Mary, who lived in Galilee. Quirinius' jurisdiction ended at the border between Galilee and Judaea, and Herod Antipas had been ruling Galilee for two years prior to the annexation of Judaea as a province of Rome. Luke's Misunderstanding of Censuses: The idea that a census would require that people travel to their ancestral home towns is patently absurd. If we imagine how this would affect commerce, trade, communications, and the maintenance of law and order, it becomes absolutely clear that no such requirements existed. The Roman Empire spanned the entire Mediterranean region, and was inhabited by some 60 million people. The road system was an amazing feat of engineering, but it simply couldn't handle 60 million people simultaneously traveling all over the empire at once. The roads would become clogged almost immediately, and people would try to circumvent the congestion by walking off road, trampling fields of crops, knocking down fences, scattering herds and flocks, and so on. The logistical problems with illiterate peasants trying to figure out where they were supposed to go would be an additional complication.
