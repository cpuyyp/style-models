Given a flavor of nominalism which denies that simple sentences and existential quantifiers referring to mathematical objects are literally true (pretense theory, fictionalism, figuralism, etc.), suppose there is a circle, C. According to my understanding, either of the propositions "the radius of C is 3 feet" or "the area of C is 5 square feet" could be literally true, since "3" and "5" only serve to specify the cardinality of "feet" and "square feet," and are not purported to imply the real existence of "3" or "5." Now, when we combine these two propositions, does an actual contradiction technically arise, or would we move into the realm of pretense/fiction/figurativ-ity when stating the two propositions in terms of the same units (likely square feet) since the units would be canceled out? We would assess the compatibility of the propositions by setting them equal to one another: area = pi * radius^2 5 square feet = pi * (3 feet)^2 5 square feet = pi * 9 square feet 5 = pi * 9 5 = 28.2743... (false) My question is, since the units were canceled out by the time we arrived at an explicit contradiction (we might say they were paraphrased away when we thought about the propositions in their most reduced form), did we lose the ability to say that these propositions are contradictory on these various nominalist views? 

In fleshing out the traditional definition of omniscience, William Lane Craig distinguishes between propositional knowledge and non-propositional knowledge, claiming that to be omniscient is to know every true proposition and not believe any false ones. He goes on to explain that God also possesses all appropriate self-knowledge, but that being non-propositional in nature, this is a bonus which is not essential to omniscience. $URL$ To illustrate this distinction, he compares the sentence "I have been treed by a moose" with "Bill has been treed by a moose," concluding that although they express the same proposition, the latter sentence must be conjoined with "I am Bill" in order for it to play the same role as the former sentence in influencing behavior. The claim is that the sentence "I am Bill" is not propositional knowledge, but a sort of non-propositional self-knowledge. This is the part I don't understand. Firstly, I don't even understand why this distinction is helpful in its context. Dr. Craig's goal appears to be clarifying that omniscience is normally understood in terms of propositional knowledge, and that therefore God does not need to possess all self-knowledge in order to be omniscient, thus deflecting any objection to omniscience based on the incoherence of God possessing the knowledge, i.e., "I am Napoleon." The problem is that even without this distinction, I can't see how "I am Napoleon" would be anything more than a false proposition when expressed from the perspective of God, which shouldn't do anything to scratch Craig's picture of God's omniscience, despite his claim, "But God doesn’t have the self-knowledge that, say, Napoleon does, in that God doesn’t believe that he is Napoleon. God doesn’t believe that he is Ronald Reagan. God knows that he is God. That is why I said that what God possesses is appropriate self-knowledge. To have all self-knowledge would be a cognitive dysfunction, not an excellence. God would be literally schizophrenic and would hold false beliefs if God thought that he were Ronald Reagan or Napoleon." If this self-knowledge was propositional in nature, God would simply not believe such propositions (and believe their negations), since they're false. Why should this be any different from God knowing "the average lifespan of a human is 5000 years" to be false? Furthermore, even if "I am Napoleon" is not a proposition, surely "I am Napoleon or married bachelors exist" is a proposition, so wouldn't this self-knowledge still turn out to be implicitly essential to omniscience? But the deeper question is how saying this self-knowledge is non-propositional even makes sense. "I am Bill" has a truth value, when expressed from some perspective that satisfies the indexical, just as the uncontroversially propositional sentence, "I have been treed by a moose" does. Granting that "God [...] would hold false beliefs if God thought that he were Ronald Reagan or Napoleon" makes it clear that "I am Ronald Reagan" and "I am Napoleon" have truth values, and isn't that sufficient for their being propositions? I was able to find some information on non-propositional knowledge under the label "knowledge-how," but this seems to be quite a different animal. $URL$ Knowledge-how refers to experiential knowledge proposed to be "irreducibly complex." Perhaps how to play the flute cannot be broken down into propositions, but this type of knowledge isn't true or false. This seems quite different from self-knowledge, instances of which actually make sense to associate with truth values. What is the correct way to conceive of self-knowledge in relation to propositions/propositional knowledge? 

The idea of the proof is simple: assume we have a prediction device which answers "yes or no" questions, then show that there is a Boolean function of the state of the universe that the prediction device cannot predict. What is this function? It is the negation of the answer given by the prediction device! This is considered a function of the state of the universe because the prediction device exists within the universe. Stripped of all its complex notation and jargon, the proof is a restatement of a logic puzzle: if there is a computer that gives "yes or no" answers and knows everything, what question can you ask that it will not be able to answer? "Will your answer to this question be 'no'?" Does this really refute determinism? Wolpert's model of a prediction device is defined as a pair C of functions (X,Y) with domain the possible wordlines (in philosophy jargon, nomologically possible worlds) u of the Universe U, where X is the 'setup function' (with no codomain defined in the paper) and Y is the 'answer functon' with codomain {0,1}. The setup function X maps to initial states of the prediction device--X(u) is the initial state of the prediction device in the worldline u of the Universe, including its input. Then the proof simply shows that the device C = (X,Y) cannot predict the function ~Y: whenever Y(u)=1, ~Y(u)=0, and obversely. Note that there is no dependence of the answer function on the setup function. For distinct answer functions Y, Y', prediction devices with identical setups C=(X,Y) and C'=(X,Y') give different answers. To prove non-determinism, Wolpert has assumed non-determinism! This has the strange consequence that if we built a machine C = (X,Y), and found that there were a function of the universe ~Y that our machine could not predict, there would be a machine C' = (X,~Y), physically indistinguishable in its initial state from C in all possible worlds (since the setup function is the same) which predicted the "unpredictable" function ~Y perfectly! To remove this circularity, could we use this argument as a reductio, i.e., assume determinism, so that any machines with distinct answer functions Y, Y' must have distinct setup functions, and then derive a contradiction from the assumption that some machine predicts the negation of its answer function? No: the argument becomes completely trivial--of course the machine (X,Y) doesn't predict the function ~Y, because our assumption of determinism implies that for each u, the initial state X(u) determines the output Y(u). In other words, if Y is not determined by X, then although it is trivial that a machine with answer function Y cannot predict the function ~Y, we can at least claim that "No matter how the device is set up, there is a function of the state of the universe it cannot predict"--as Wolpert says in the paper, even if the device is given the correct answer in its input, it cannot predict the output of the function correctly. This sounds impressive, until we realize that this is because we've already assumed non-determinism. But if we assume that the initial state of the device determines its output, then the proof result reduces to "If a machine is set up to output some values, then the values it is set up to output are not equal to the negation of these values." We have either circularity or triviality. The door to determinism remains open.
