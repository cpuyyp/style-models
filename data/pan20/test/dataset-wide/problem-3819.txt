Indeed suppose that $A$ has ACC. (iii) immediately follows. Let $(I_n)$ be an increasing sequence of ideals; so $(I_n\cap k1_A)$ is an ascending sequence of ideals of $k1_A$ and hence is stationary, say for $n\ge n_0$. Also $(k1_A+I_n)$ is an ascending sequence of $k$-subalgebras of $A$. So there exists $n_1$ (say $\ge n_0$) such that for every $n\ge n_1$ and $x\in I_n$, one can write $x=x'+t1_A$ with $x'\in I_{n_1}$ and $t\in k$. Then $x'-x\in I_n\cap k1_A$ and hence $x'-x\in I_{n_0}$. Thus $x\in I_{n_1}$; whence $I_n=I_{n_1}$ for all $n\ge n_1$. This proves (i). To prove (ii), use that $A$ is noetherian to write a nested sequence of submodules $0\le N_1\le \dots N_k=N_A$ with each $N_i$ isomorphic as an $A$-module to $A/P_i$ for some prime $i$. Suppose by contradiction that some $N_i$ is an infinitely generated $k$-module. Since ACC passes to quotients, we can suppose that $i=1$. Since $P_i$ annihilates $N_1$ and contains the nilradical, we see that $xy=0$ for all $x,y\in N_1$. Therefore, for every $k$-submodule $V$ of $N_1$, the $k$-subalgebra generated by $V$ is reduced to $k1_A+V$. So if $(V_n)$ is an increasing sequence of submodules, from ACC we deduce that for large $n$, $k1_A+V_n=k1_A+V_{n+1}$ (in other words, the canonical map $V_n/(k1_A\cap V_n)\to V_{n+1}/(k1_A\cap V_{n+1})$ is an isomorphism). Since $k$ is noetherian, $(k1_A\cap V_n)$, as an ascending sequence of $k$-submodule of $k1_A$, is also stationary, say with union $W$. Hence the above canonical map is the inclusion $V_n/W\to V_{n+1}/W$; since it is an isomorphism it means that $V_{n+1}=V_n$. Conversely suppose that (i),(ii),(iii) hold. It is easy to check (see below) that a finite direct product of $k$-algebras with ACC has ACC. By (i), $A$ has finitely many minimal primes $P_i$, so $A/N_A$ embeds as subalgebra in the finite product $\prod A/P_i$, which has ACC using (iii), hence $A/N_A$ has ACC. Also it is immediate that if an algebra $A$ has an ideal $I$ that is a f.g. $k$-module and $A/I$ has ACC then $A$ has ACC. Then using (ii) $A$ has ACC. 

Thus we have proved that if $H$ does not contain the product of two non-abelian free subgroups, then it is either free or is contained with finite index in the product of a cyclic group and a free group, and hence the same holds for all subgroups of $H$. In particular $H$ is coherent. 

Counterexample: the endomorphism of the product of two punctured lines (complement of the curve of equation $xy=0$ in the plane) given by $$(x,y)\mapsto f(x,y)=\left(\frac{x}{y},y^2\right)$$ We have $$\begin{pmatrix}\partial_1f_1 & \partial_2f_1\\ \partial_1f_2 & \partial_2f_2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{y} & -\frac{x}{y^2}\\ 0 & 2y\end{pmatrix},$$ so the Jacobian is constant equal to 1. It's not an automorphism, since both $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$ map to $(1,1)$. 

Consider a basis of the $\mathbf{Q}$-vector space $\mathbf{Q}_p$ given as elements of $\mathbf{Z}_p\smallsetminus p\mathbf{Z}_p$, written as elements $e_n$ for integers $n\in\mathbf{Z}$ and $f_i$ for $i$ in some uncountable index set. Define a $\mathbf{Q}$-linear automorphism $q$ of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ by $q(e_n)=p^ne_n$ and $q(f_i)=f_i$. It fixes (pointwise) a subgroup of countable index of $\mathbf{Q}_p$, namely the $\mathbf{Q}$-subspace $S$ spanned by the $f_i$. Define $H=q(\mathbf{Z}_p)$. Then by construction, $H\cap\mathbf{Z}_p$ has infinite countable index in both $\mathbf{Z}_p$ and $H$. This would be enough if you weren't requesting the compact open subgroup be maximal. This can be done as follows: define $G$ as the amalgamation of $\mathbf{Z}_p$ with $\mathbf{Q}_p$ along $p\mathbf{Z}_p$. Then the left-hand $\mathbf{Z}_p$ (call it $A$) is a maximal compact (open) subgroup of $G$, is isomorphic to $H$ as an abstract group, and $H\cap A$ has countable infinite index in both $A$ and $H$. 

What if your ring is the $\mathbf{R}$-algebra $\mathbf{R}^2$ with the bilinear law $$(x,y)(z,t)=\begin{pmatrix}2x & -y \\ y & x\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}z \\ t\end{pmatrix}=(2xz-yt,yz+xt)\quad?$$ It's even commutative. 

There's a quite quick recursive algorithm to compute the stable value of $a_n$ modulo $k$. If I do it for $a_{10}$ (i.e. $k=10!$) and put things upside down to be deductive, I get, successively (independently of the choice of $b$): $$n\ge 2\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 0 [2]$$ since the group $(\mathbf{Z}/3\mathbf{Z})^*$ has exponent 3 and 2 belongs to it, we deduce $$n\ge 2\Rightarrow 2^{a_n}\equiv 1 [3]$$ $$n\ge 3\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 1 [3];\quad a_n\equiv 0[2]$$ $$n\ge 3\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 4 [6]$$ since the group $(\mathbf{Z}/9\mathbf{Z})^*$ has exponent 6 and 2 belongs to it, we deduce $$n\ge 3\Rightarrow 2^{a_n}\equiv 16 [9]$$ $$n\ge 4\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 16 [9];\quad 2^{a_n}\equiv 0 [4]$$ $$n\ge 5\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 16 [36]$$ since the group $(\mathbf{Z}/135\mathbf{Z})^*$ has exponent 36 (being isomorphic to $(\mathbf{Z}/27\mathbf{Z})^*\times (\mathbf{Z}/5\mathbf{Z})^*$ where the factors have cardinal 18 and 4, whose lcm is 36), we get $$n\ge 5\Rightarrow 2^{a_n}\equiv 2^{16} [135]=196[135]$$ $$n\ge 6\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 196 [135];\quad a_n\equiv 0[4]$$ $$n\ge 6\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 196 [4\times 135]$$ if $m=14175=3^4.5^2.7$, the group $(\mathbf{Z}/m\mathbf{Z})^*$ contains 2 and has exponent $4.135=540$, whence $$n\ge 6\Rightarrow 2^{a_n}\equiv 2^{196} [14175]= 1275136 [14175],$$ where $1275136=2^8.17.293$; hence $$n\ge 7\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 1275136 [14175],\quad a_n\equiv 1275136 [2^8]$$ $$n\ge 7\Rightarrow a_n\equiv 1275136 [10!]$$ since $10!=14175\times 2^8$. Of course the algorithmic (deterministic) way to proceed goes reverse: if you want to compute the stable value of $a_n$ modulo a certain number $k$, write $k=k'k''$ with $k'$ power of 2 and $k''$ odd. In practice the case of $k'$ is rather trivial since the 2-valuation of $a_n$ grows very fastly. Then to know $a_n$ modulo $k''$, since $k''$ is odd, it is enough to know the exponent $m$ of the group $(\mathbf{Z}/k''\mathbf{Z})^*$, which is easy as soon as you can factor $k''$ into primes (write $k''$ as product of powers $k_i$ of distinct primes, and take the lcm of the orders of the $(\mathbf{Z}/k_i\mathbf{Z})^*$). Then you need to compute of the stable value of $a_n$ modulo $m$, and $m$ is usually much smaller than $k$ (above, for $k=10!$, 5 steps were needed). Thus if $a_n\equiv p_m$ for $n\ge C_m$ independently of $b$, you deduce that $a_n\equiv 2^{p_m}$ for all $n\ge C_m+1$ independently of $b$. Then compute $2^{p_m}$ modulo $k''$ (or modulo $k$) to make it reasonable, and deduce from the Chinese remainder theorem the value of $a_n$ modulo $k$ for $n\ge C_m+1$. Added: the stable value of $a_n[k!]$ immediately entails the computation of $c_n$ for $n\le k-1$, namely $c_n=(a\,\mathrm{mod}\,(n+1)!-a\,\mathrm{mod}\,n!)/n!$. Thus $$(c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5,c_6,c_7,c_8,c_9)=(0,2,2,0,0,0,5,4,3).$$ To find $c_{10}$, you can run the same method to compute $a\,\mathrm{mod}\,(11)!$. 

Begin with $BS(n,n)=\langle t,x\mid tx^nt^{-1}=x^n\rangle$. Let $L$ be the kernel of the homomorphism $BS(n,n)\to\mathbf{Z}$, $t\mapsto 0$, $x\mapsto 1$. Using the action of $BS(n,n)$ on its standard Bass-Serre tree shows that $L$ is free. It is generated by the $x^mtx^{-m}$ when $m$ ranges over $\mathbf{Z}$, but since this sequence is $n$-periodic, $m$ ranging over $\{0,\dots,n-1\}$ is enough. It can be shown that this is a free family but I won't check it since this is enough to show that $L$ is free of rank $\le n$, which is enough for your purposes. Now $x^n$ is central and $L\times\langle x^n\rangle$ has finite index. For $BS(n,-n)=\langle t,x:tx^nt^{-1}=x^{-n}\rangle$, we need to consider the subgroup $H$ of index 2 kernel of the homomorphism mapping $x$ to $0$ and $t$ to 1 mod 2. It has the presentation, denoting $u=t^2$ and $y=tx^{-1}t^{-1}$: $\langle u,x,y\mid x^n=y^n, tx^nt^{-1}=x^n,ty^nt^{-1}=y^n\rangle$. But the latter is also isomorphic to a subgroup of index 2 in $BS(n,n)$ (kernel of the same homomorphism, but with $y$ defined as $txt^{—1}\in BS(n,n)$ instead). This yield a (free $\times$ infinite cyclic) subgroup of finite index, but rather $F_{2n-1}\times\mathbf{Z}$ than $F_n\times\mathbf{Z}$ (although I don't claim there's no $F_n\times\mathbf{Z}$ of finite index). 

About your example, "almost something" is often a bad choice of terminology, and as ambiguous as possible. When a terminology is ambiguous and some other better terminology is available (in your example, "commensurated subgroup" is used, see for instance this paper by Conner and Mihalik and the references therein). PS: It seems to me that these types of questions are preferably ticked as Community Wiki. 

Yes: actually $\mathcal{F}$ is Zariski-closed in $G^k$. (And since $\mathcal{F}\neq G^k$ as soon as $k\ge 1$ and $G\neq\{1\}$, we deduce in this case that $\mathcal{F}$ is not Zariski-dense.) 

No. Consider $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$. Assume that the Zariski closure of $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$ contains $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{R})$, or more generally is irreducible and non-compact. Then $(\Gamma\ltimes\mathbf{Z}^n,\mathbf{Z}^n)$ has Kazhdan's relative Property T (by an argument due to Kazhdan, Burger, Shalom, see Theorem 1.4.5 in the Bekka-Harpe-Valette book), and in particular $\Gamma\ltimes\mathbf{Z}^n$ fails to be Haagerup. If moreover $\Gamma$ is right-orderable (e.g., is free), then $\Gamma\ltimes\mathbf{Z}^n$ is right-orderable as well. For every $n\ge 2$ some such free subgroup can indeed be found (e.g., of finite index when $n=2$). [With no irreducibility assumption, it is more generally true that $\Gamma\ltimes\mathbf{Z}^n$ fails to be Haagerup whenever $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$ is non-virtally-solvable, by a slight refinement of the argument). 

As regards the semisimple case, if by contradiction $G$ is semisimple and $Z$ is an infinitely generated central subgroup, then the quotient $H$ of $G$ by its center is semisimple and not compactly presented. Then one way to get a contradiction is to use that $G$ is quasi-isometric to its symmetric space, which is non-positively curved and hence large-scale simply connected, and for $G$ this means compactly presented, a contradiction. Of course this latter proof relies on some Riemannian and metric material. 

First (a) and (b) imply the non-existence of $X$ as required. We start from the classical fact that in a Euclidean space, any isometry between any two subsets has an isometric extension to the whole plane (see appendix C.2 in the Bekka-Harpe-Valette book, or check directly). So the question can be reformulated as follows: 

Indeed, write $$H=H(t,u)=\langle t,u\mid t^3,u^3,(tu)^4,(t^{-1}u)^4\rangle.$$ Conversely, let us first show that $H\neq 1$ implies $G\neq 1$. Note that $H\neq 1$ means that $t,u$ have order 3. Define $$L=L(t,u,v)=\langle t,u,v\mid t^3,u^3,v^3,(tu)^4,(t^{-1}u)^4,(uv)^4,(uv^{-1})^4\rangle.$$ Then $L$ is the amalgam of $H(t,u)$ and $H(u,v)$ over the cyclic subgroup of order 3 $\langle u\rangle$ (which by the way has index $\ge 3$, since $H$ is perfect and nontrivial and hence of cardinal $\ge 60$). Let $M$ be the subgroup of $L(t,u,v)$ generated by $t$ and $v$. Consider the double $D$ of $L=L(t,u,v)$ over $M$, that is, the amalgam $L\ast_M L$. Then it has the presentation $$D=\langle t,u,v,t_2,u_2,v_2\mid t^3,u^3,v^3,(tu)^4,(t^{-1}u)^4,(uv)^4,(uv^{-1})^4,t_2^3,u_2^3,v_2^3,(t_2u_2)^4,(t_2^{-1}u_2)^4,(u_2v_2)^4,(u_2v_2^{-1})^4,t=t_2,v=v_2\rangle.$$ Eliminate $v_2(=v)$ and $t_2(=t)$ and write $w=u_2$. This yields $$D=\langle t,u,v,w\mid t^3,u^3,v^3,(tu)^4,(t^{-1}u)^4,(uv)^4,(uv^{-1})^4,w^3,(tw)^4,(t^{-1}w)^4,(wv)^4,(wv^{-1})^4\rangle,$$ where we precisely recognize $G$. Hence $G\neq 1$. Now let us check that $G$ is a nontrivial amalgam- actually double- (over subgroups of index $\ge 3$). Indeed, let me discuss. If $M$ has index $\ge 3$, it's OK. $M$ can't have index 2 because $L$ is perfect. If $M=1$ (sounds unlikely but I haven't checked), then $L=M$ itself was described as an amalgam, actually a double. Finally, to check that $H\neq 1$, just observe that in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_7$, $t=(123)(456)$ and $u=(234)(576)$ satisfies the given relators of $H$. 

The answer is positive. Details and link to Bourbaki, Lie groups and Lie algebras, Chap VII, are given in the answer here. 

A negative answer to (1) sounds like a natural extension of our conjecture. Some evidence: in the main two cases for which the conjecture is known to hold in the Hilbert case, the same argument also works for arbitrary uniformly convex Banach spaces (UCB): on the one hand non-virtually abelian nilpotent groups (which don't embed bilipschitz into a UCB, by a result of Pauls), and groups with a bilipschitz-embedded 3-regular tree (which don't embed into a UCB by Bourgain, and include non-amenable f.g. groups by Benjamini-Schramm, and also include non-virtually nilpotent solvable f.g. groups). 

Indeed we even have, in a infinite group: for every finite subset $S$ and $n$ there exist a finite subset $F$ of cardinal $n$ such that the multiplication is injective on $S\times F$. Indeed, first find $F'=\{x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}\}$ of cardinal $n-1$ (by induction). Choose $x_n$ distinct from $s^{-1}tx_i$ for all $s,t\in S$ and $i<n$. So $Sx_n$ is disjoint from $SF'$ and thus, writing $F=F'\cup\{x_n\}$, we have $|SF|=|S|n$. As I said in my original comment, the same argument yields the existence, for all $n\ge 1$, of a subset $A$ of cardinal $n$ such that $|A^2|=1+n(n-1)/2$; this is optimal as we can see in an elementary abelian 2-group. As observed in the comments, in an abelian clearly we cannot do better than $n(n+1)/2$; conversely this bound can probably be achieved in any group of infinite exponent (using the existence of cyclic subgroups of arbitrary order). Also $n^2$ can be achieved in any non-abelian free group, hence in any group containing a non-abelian free subgroup. 

This does not answer the question but at least gives a counterexample to the conjecture in Luo's paper. I assume that $\mathrm{PSL}_2(R)$ is defined as the quotient of $\mathrm{SL}_2(R)$ by its center, the set of matrices $\begin{pmatrix}t & 0\\ 0 & t\end{pmatrix}$, $t^2=1$. This has the property $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\prod_i R_i)=\prod_i\mathrm{PSL}_2(R_i)$. Lemma 1: let $G$ be a finitely generated group that is not embeddable into $\mathrm{PSL}_2$ over any field. Then $G\ast G$ is not embeddable into $\mathrm{PSL}_2$ over any commutative ring. Proof: embed $G\ast G$ into $\mathrm{PSL}_2(R)$; we can suppose that $R$ is finitely generated; let $N$ be the nilradical of $R$, so $N^k=0$ for some $k$ and it follows that the kernel of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(R)\to\mathrm{PSL}_2(R/N)$ is a nilpotent group. Since $|G|\ge 3$, $G\ast G$ has no nontrivial nilpotent normal subgroup. Hence the composite map $G\ast G\to\mathrm{PSL}_2(R/N)$ is injective. Now $R/N$ is a reduced commutative noetherian ring and hence is embeddable in a finite product of fields (since $R/N$ has finitely many minimal prime ideals, whose intersection is trivial). So we have an embedding of $G\ast G$ into a product $\prod_{i=1}^n\mathrm{PSL}_2(K_i)$. Now we use a general property: if a group $H$ has the property that any two nontrivial normal subgroups have nontrivial intersection, then whenever $H$ embeds into a direct product of two groups, the projection to at least one factor remains injective. This applies to the group $G\ast G$. Hence it embeds into $\mathrm{PSL}_2(K_i)$ for some $i$, contradicting the assumption. $\Box$ Now I apply this to $G$ the binary icosahedral group of order 120. Indeed this group cannot be embedded in $\mathrm{PSL}_2$ of any field. This is easy, showing (in arbitrary characteristic) that, unlike in $G$, the centralizer of any element of order 2 in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(K)$ is solvable. Since $G$ is the $\pi_1$ of a closed 3-manifold, so is $G\ast G$, namely of the connected sum of two copies of the Poincaré manifold. (Btw, I expect that $G$ itself is not embeddable in $\mathrm{PSL}_2$ of any finite commutative ring. It true this is probably not too hard -- one can suppose that the ring is local and I think I've checked the case of odd characteristic.) 

Here's one approach with no geometry/integration, using finite groups. First prove it for a (nontrivial) finite $p$-group. If $p$ is odd, it contains a central element of order $p$, whose centralizer is $\mathbf{C}$-diagonalizable, hence embeddable as a $p$-subgroup of the nonzero complexes; this has to be cyclic. For $p=2$, it contains $-I$, and you need to proceed with the same argument in $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbf{R})$, so your group stands as an extension with order 2 kernel and cyclic quotient (of order some power of 2), with only one element of order 2: lifting a generator from the quotient we obtain a group which is either cyclic or direct product of cyclic with $\{I,-I\}$; since there's only one element of order 2, we deduce that that such a group is cyclic. So all Sylow subgroups are cyclic: this was the easy part. Now a group whose Sylow subgroups are cyclic is called a Z-group and these are known, apparently by Zassenhaus in the 30's, that such a group is metacyclic. I don't know how hard is this result, but it is certainly not relying on the Classification, nor any deep part of it. So let's go ahead with a (nontrivial) metacyclic group $G$. It contains a nontrivial normal cyclic subgroup $H$, with cyclic quotient. If $H$ has order 2, the lifting argument above shows that the group is either cyclic or direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and another cyclic group, and in this case, the latter has to be of odd order, so the whole group is cyclic anyway. Otherwise, $H$ has order $\ge 3$, and hence preserves exactly two lines in $\mathbf{R}^2$. So the normalizer $N$ of $H$ in $\text{GL}_2(\mathbf{C})$ preserves this unordered pair of lines. Let $Z$ be the centralizer of $H$ in $\text{GL}_2(\mathbf{C})$, which is abelian and has index 2 in $N$. Let us check that any two elements $g,h$ in $G\cap (N-Z)$ commute. Observe that all elements in $N-Z$ are square roots of $-I$. It follows that $g$ conjugates $gh$ to its inverse $h^{-1}g^{-1}$ (which is equal to $-hg^{-1}=g^2hg^{-1}$). Now if $x$ is a element in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$ of finite order $\ge 3$, its centralizer in $\text{GL}_2(\mathbf{R})$ is contained in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$, and it is conjugate to its inverse by some element not in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$; it follows that $x$ is not conjugate to its inverse in $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. Thus $gh$ has order at most 2 and $g$ and $h$ commute. Thus either $G\subset Z$ and $G$ is commutative, or $G$ is generated by $G\smallsetminus Z$ which is a commutative subset and hence $G$ is commutative anyway. So $G$ is abelian and we're done. Edit: Here's a way to have a self-contained approach, avoiding the use of Zassenhaus's theorem. Taking a minimal counterexample, we get a finite group all of whose maximal subgroups are cyclic. Assume that a finite group $G$ is not abelian and has all its maximal subgroups abelian; let us show that $G$ is abelian-by-cyclic. It amounts to proving that one of its maximal subgroups is abelian. Its center cannot be maximal (this holds in any group!). So any maximal subgroup contains a non-central element. Since the maximal subgroup is abelian, it is actually the centralizer of any of its non-central elements. Besides, any maximal subgroup contains the center $Z$ of $G$ (otherwise $G$ would be abelian). It follows that $M\cap N=Z$ for any two distinct maximal subgroups. Let $(M_i)_{1\le i\le k}$ representatives of conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups. Let $r_i$ be the index of the normalizer of $M_i$, so that $M_i$ has exactly $r_i$ conjugates. Since the maximal subgroups minus $Z$ partition $G\smallsetminus Z$, and setting $z=|Z|$ and $m_i=|M_i|$, $g=|G|$, we get $z+\sum_i (m_i-z)r_i=g$. Assume by contradiction that for all $i$, $M_i$ is not normal; thus $m_ir_i=g$ for all $i$, and we get $(k-1)g=z(-1+\sum_i r_i)$. If $M_i$ is the centralizer of some $x_i$, then $r_i$ is the cardinal of the conjugacy class of $x_i$. These conjugacy classes are disjoint modulo $Z$, hence $\sum r_i\le g/z$, hence $k<2$. So $k=1$ and the above equation then reads $z(-1+r_1)=0$, so $r_1=1$, a contradiction, so $G$ is abelian-by-cyclic. Turning back to our minimal counterexample, it is thus metacyclic. The first and third part of the previous argument, which do not rely on the Zassenhaus theorem, show that any metacyclic subgroup of $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$ is cyclic.
