Instead of worrying about whether you agree with his grammatical constructions, look for changes to meaning. Those are the critical ones to fix. Instead of approaching it as a mistake on his part (especially since this is a client), you can then approach it as: Perhaps your orginal wasn't clear enough and he misinterpeted what you meant when he did the revisions. Then offer a third verson of the wording. This saves face for him and, more importantly, is more likely to get your revision of his revision accepted and the correct meaning restored. 

I have never seen a large company where there is much negotiating room on the annual appraisal pay raise. This is budgeted money after all and they have spent weeks negotiating how it will be split up. That doesn't mean you can't ask for raise or get a promotion outside of that process. Just don't do it immediately after the appraisal. The best time seems to be after someone has left who is not being replaced, that's when there is some salary money available in the budget. 

By all the definitions of an unpaid intership I have ever seen, this is an internship. You are there to learn how to navigate the workplace and gain some professional experience. And you need the job completion to pass. So you are being paid just not in money. It is counterproductive to blow this opportunity off as unimportant because you are not being paid money. If you make them annoyed enough at your lack of professionalism, you very well may not pass. You certainly won't get a job offer from the place and you will likely get a bad reference. In other words, you will have wasted your time and made your personal situation worse rather than improved. Professionals don't just wander in whenever they want to. If they know they are coming in later than the normal hours, they tell their boss. They may have an agreement about what hours to be there (I could be expected to show up by 11 not 8) or they may have flex time (which certainly gives you more latitude but not total control generally), but the real problem is in not letting people know when to expect you. Especially as you get more senior, you will need to coordinate with others and it is very annoying when the person you need to talk to about something just wanders in whenever. Some places are more flexible than others about lateness of the 10-15 minutes variety if it is occasional. However, the flexibility may well depends on how flexible other parts of the organization are. If people in other departments don't have the flexibility to be late, then lateness anywhare is less acceptable because HR will want to make sure that all employees are treated equally. The worst place I ever saw for this was a call center that had some dev support people. People there even had to take breaks at a set time and get permission to go to the bathroom. People not on the phones who didn't follow the same rules got called in to HR because the call-takers complained. Was this stupid? Indeed it was. BUt as long as you worked there (and believe me almost everyone got out as soon as they could find another job), you had to follow the rules and there was a zero % chance they would change. You need to discuss this, not with us, but with your boss to find out what is acceptable where you are working. One of the main things you need to learn at an internship of this type is that the expectations of the company will be different at every company and you have to meet that company's expectations; they will not change to be what you would prefer. This is part of being junior, you have less leverage than a senior well-respected colleague in either getting rules changes accepted or in being able to get an exception made for you. More than likely when this company provides feedback to your school (and they will if you have to do this to pass), they will not only be evaluating the technical merit of what you built but your attitude. Get used to this now - it is part of what you are there to learn. In school, no one grades on attitude. In business is is often significantly more important than technical skills. From what you wrote, you are intending to blow this off as unimportant. If you can't take it seriously because you are not getting paid, you deserve to flunk. And taking it seriously includes following their policies even ones you personally consider to be stupid like caring about lateness. In all jobs there are things that you won't agree with. Nobody gets their way all the time and people who try to often are the first people the managers get rid of. No one wants to employ a prima donna who won't fit in the corporate culture. Especially not at a junior level. Top notch seniors, being much more rare, are given much more leeway because they are harder to recruit. At the junior level, they will probably have 100 or more applications within hours of an announcement. So if someone tells your your lateness is a problem (and I would guess someone did or you would not be asking this), then take that seriously and fix the issue even if you don't agree with the fix. 

There are several issues here to be addressed. Yes indeed your boss has the absolute right and responsibility to tell you what is is not appropriate in official business correspondence. Anything coming from the company, like responses to issues that customers have brought to a help desk, needs to enhance the company image in the way the company wants it enhanced. Even internally, what you write in official systems is part of the impression that other parts of the company have of your department not just you as an individual. And it is entirely possible that your boss was asked to get you to stop adding those phrases because there were complaints about them. Many people absolutely hate the phrase "Have a nice day." It is not being nice to add that phrase. At best, it is a meaningless stock phrase. At worse it is actively at odds with the message being answered. It is a good thing to want to be nice to the customers or clients. What you need to address is a more effective way to do that than the use of stock phrases. If you are in a help desk situation (which it sounded like you were), then the best way to be nice to the customer is to fix their problem. The next best thing is to actively listen to what they have to say and respond to it appropriately without getting mad or snippy or going off on an unrelated tangent. For instance, I recently had a question about something for a piece of software I used. The help desk person responded with, that information is on our website. Well if I had been able to find it on the website I would not have asked. I pointed this out and the response was a link to a 60 page pdf document. I pointed out that I didn't want to wade through that and could he just answer my very simple question (BTW I did read it and it skated around my issue but did not answer it.). He pointed me to something related to my question but not answering it. Something far enough away from what I asked that if he had paid attention to what I asked he would not have sent that to me as an answer. I then emailed back and told him that I would no longer be buying further software from his company. In any of those emails, "Have a nice day." would have been taken as sarcastic nonsense. My question was one he should have been able to answer in five minutes or less. Instead we went about two weeks emailing back and forth as I tried to get him to actually pay attention to what I was saying. A customer service rep who was being nice would have simply answered the question in the first place. One who didn't know the answer, should have referred me to someone who would or looked for the answer himself. That is being nice, not using stock phrases. Now another way to be nice is to respond to what the person says when they go off on a tangent. For instance, I totally lost it once when a company kept calling my phone and asking for my boyfriend who had just died. The third time I told them he was dead, I totally lost it and begged them to take him out of their database. A nice customer service rep at that point (and I did have one, it wasn't his fault that no one had marked my boyfriend as dead in their system) would have expressed sympathy for my loss as well as taking action to ensure I didn't have to endure frequent calls from this company asking for a person who was no longer alive. A not nice customer service rep would have ignored what I said. Sending me an email confirming that they had removed my dead boyfriend from their marketing database that ended with "Have a nice day." would have sent me into tears. It would not have been a nice gesture. With customers such as internal ones that you deal with repeatedly, you can get more personal, but probably not within an official ticketing system. If someone just returned from maternity leave, I might ask about their baby. Someone who just got back from a vacation in Hawaii might get asked how the trip went etc. Connecting on a personal basis is being nice. Going the extra mile to help someone out is nice. Smiling at people and complimenting them is nice. Telling their boss what a a good job they are doing is nice. Calming down someone who is upset is nice. Using rote phrases is neutral at best. 

This is a tricky one. With a disabilty that can affect the quality or timeliness of your work, I personally I found that it is often advantageous to tell your boss so that he knows why something is happening. However, in a profession that requires frequent learning, it might be considered by some to be a something that disqualifies you from the job (which is why you usually don't bring it up in an interview). Further the personality of the boss and corporate culture come into play. If you can see that they have made obviously accommodations for someone else who has a disability, they are less likely to react badly. Only you can truly assess how risky telling your particular boss and your particular company is. You should also assess why you want to tell him. If you are telling him because you want to be assigned to work on legacy stuff so that there is less learning involved is different than telling him because you think you are about to get a bad performance appraisal.If you don't have any accomodations you want and have no performance concerns, then I would not bring it up. If you choose to tell him, then the way I would approach it is: First make sure your performance is a good as it can be. People will make more accommodations for a valuable employee than one who is average or below. So go the extra mile for some time before you bring it up and make sure he knows you are going the extra mile. Do not bring it up as an excuse if he brings you in to talk about a performance problem. That is the worst possible time to talk about it. If that happens, accept whatever criticism he gives you and resolve to try to fix it. Then about amonth later, come to him and tell him what you have been diagnosed with and follow the rest of the steps. If he fires you for not being able to keep up before you have told him, then anything you say is too late at that point. In that case, what you want to do is look for a position where they work on less cutting edge stuff, so that there is less to learn on a daily basis. Have a plan of action. "I have a learning disability, you figure out what to do about it" just isn't going to make it. Be prepared to discuss how you personally work around your disability (and highlight your successes) and what accommodation in the workplace you want. Be prepared to show how you spend your own time learning to make up for the slower pace of your learning at work, for instance. Also since this is a medical condition, you might want to provide documentary proof that you have it. And you might want to be prepared with some educational materials; this is something your boss may never have heard of and not be aware of the the ramifications. No matter how you prepare, it is risky, so be prepared mentally to have negative consequences before you do it. Even if you don't lose your job, sometimes, having it known that you have a medical problem that seems a bit odd can make people act as if they think you are lying. I had a close friend who got diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue and her doctor told her she had to reduce to part time. For the next ten years until she retired, her co-workers hassled her because they didn't believe fatigue was a real condition. Your condition could be similar because this is not a common condition. 

It seems as if you actually are a data analytics person and that would be the number one priority for your job in any company I have worked for. Managers tend to want people to do the job they were hired to do or they give them a new title and job responsibilities. Therefore, the fact that they continually take you off of your pet project is not at all surprising. It is amazing that they let you take on the project frankly. Now as far as managing these priorities, first you make sure the data analytics task is indeed the highest priority. If it is then, every time they take you off the other task, you notify your boss with how much it will delay the second task and officially move the deadline down. If they decide the other project is higher priority, then your boss can fight it out with the team with the dashboard. But first he has to see the actual movement of the deadline based on the interruptions. Further, you need to work on getting a better relationship with this team you do data analytics for and do what they want the first time, so they are not continually changing their minds and interrupting the other project. Get rid of the attitude that they are problem; it part of why they are a problem be cause nobody likes to deal with someone who treats them with disdain. I know you dislike this work and I would guess you are blowing off doing it well just from the way you write about it. Stop thinking of them as the enemy and start making friends with them and be serious about finding out their needs. I would wager they are as frustrated as you are with your support. Spending a little more effort up front tends to result in a lot less changes after. You also need to understand the company importance and meaning of the data you are analyzing for them. It may be critical to making millions of dollars for the company or it may be more minor in effect. But you need to know what the data is being used for and understand why it may be critical to support it above your pet project. You appear to be making the mistake of thinking that what you prefer to do is more important because it is your preference. Business needs don't work that way.
