The most likely complication is that proper shifting using a compact crank set requires that the front derailleur sit lower on the seat tube. If your frame has a braze-on mount for the front derailleur it is likely too high to work with bolt on derailleur, and may get in the way if you try to use a bracket-mount front derailleur. 

I'm no expert but having repaired the paint on several cars, I would think that a week from the application of the last coat should be long enough for the paint to cure if it was applied correctly. That said I would assume one of two things: 

I have in the past stopped and held up my hand in a 'stop' gesture and had a short conversation with people riding the wrong way. If they stop, which they normally do, I typically and quickly try to point out: 

They are links that can be seperated without the use of a specialized chain tool to push a pin through the rollers. There are others besides those shown, one of the more common being an SRAM Power Link which looks like this: 

The plan and rack are from CycleSafe, and I really like that "tray" style of rack. I have seen similar rack arrangements at a few local businesses where the racks are mounted to the outside of the building. This style of wall rack is also nice because you can secure your bike with a standard "U" or cable lock. 

You should look at using mountain style Shimano SPD compatible shoes. In general, mountain shoes have a little more room and give and there are a lot of brands that are SPD compatible. Keen has a line of cycling shoes and sandals that you can find at larger outdoor retailers like REI or many places online. I mention REI specifically because in the past I have ordered two sizes of clothing and footwear online and returned the one that didn't fit with no hassle. My experience with Keen footwear is that the run a little wide all over and are especially wide in the toe box. 

The law regarding sidewalk cycling varies widely, but in general it is legal as long as you are traveling cautiously, yielding and giving pedestrians the right-of-way. That said, it usually is not a very smart thing to do, especially to ride against traffic on the sidewalk as you described. The most common accidents involving cars and cyclists occur at intersections and driveways. When you are on the sidewalk going either way you are already nearly invisible to a motorist. It's particularly bad when you are riding against traffic because the habit of most drivers is to look left (in the US) when they approach an intersection or pull out of a driveway, and you are approaching at an unusually high rate of speed for a sidewalk user, and from the opposite direction. In short - riding on the sidewalk and against traffic is the most dangerous way to travel on a bike other than to ride unlighted at night. As Forester says "Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles." 

This will differ by locality, but in general the rule is that cyclists yield to pedestrians. This means that if you are involved in a collision with a pedestrian there will be a presumption that you were in some way at fault or negligent and will likely have to prove instead that the pedestrian was at fault before any claim for liability can be made. 

There may be something that I don't know about, but if the crank fits on the bottom bracket, and if the chainring is reasonably close to the position of a middle ring on a triple chainring setup, then your chain line should be fine and everything should work. A lot of bike targeted at young riders have a single front ring and 7 or 8 gears in the back. The chain line is the most important thing to consider, since you don't want excessive torque on the chain when you are in either the lowest or highest gear. 

1f you really want to convert, I would start with just buying the cassette and seeing if it will work with or without a spacer. If not, then you can buy a new hub or wheel. Realize that if you convert you are also going to be buying at least new shifters, and possibly derraileurs as well. You are getting into the realm of my favorite saying: "A new bike fixes everything." Every shop I have worked with, and the three places I order from online all have multiple 9-speed cassette options. Staying 9 speed will save you a bunch of money and give you years of commuting work. If you are worried about the future, buy two and throw one in your parts bin or toolbox. 

The Simplest Option - Passive Lock Strap By far the simplest and easiest way to do this is to use a "trunk lock strap" or "passive lock strap". Searching in Google for either of those phases should turn up suitable products. The idea with these is that they are a flexible cable that you loop around your bike and then close a thicker stubbed end inside your vehicle either in your trunk if you use a rear rack, or inside a passenger door if you use a roof rack. You should note that no product is completely theft-proof, and you will ideally want to use more than one locking/security mechanism. At a minimum, if leaving the bike on the rack, I would remove the front tire and put it in the car as well as using this strap. That way they can't just cut the strap and ride away with the bike. More Complicated - Tow Loop A more complicated and likely far more expensive option is to look into the installation of an external Tow Loop. Many modern cars that are not equipped with a towing package, still have some kind of loop or bracket either directly under the bumper, or beneath some removable cover in the bumper. You can have an externally accessible tow loop retrofitted to the car and then you could lock the bike with a cable through that loop. Google your vehicle make and model and add the words "tow hooks" or "tow points" for ideas, or talk to a qualified auto mechanic/dealer. 

Decrease the nose angle a few degrees. This could be especially helpful since in a time-trial position most riders are inclined closer to horizontal an this can significantly increase the pressure on the perineum. Move the saddle a few millimeters forward. This compensates for the tendency to slide slightly forward when in the drops or on your aero-bars, and helps keep the saddle pressure on your sit bones. 

I am going to second @freiheit suggestion that you reconsider the drop bars. You commute is going to be roughly 90+ minutes each way in an urban setting and you will want the extra had positions. You can still get a geometry that is relaxed and gives you a more upright position. When my commute got longer (15+ miles one way) I switched from a converted hardtail (rack, slicks and fenders) to a 'touring' bike. This is a 'road' bike with drop bars, a more relaxed geometry, longer chainstays (to accommodate a rack an panniers) and lot's of rack and bottle braze-ons. The gearing is wide, so hills and wind don't bother me. The forks and stays are wide as well, with cantilever brakes to accommodate fenders. This is similar to the bike I own. When all is said and done, the best suggestion is to go to your local bike shop (the one you go to all the time for parts and advice, right?) and describe to the staff the way you expect to use your bike. They will have the best suggestions based on your riding style, your requirements, your body geometry and your budget. As an added bonus, you can test ride their suggestions. 

In general a SRAM or KMC link for an 8 or 9 speed chain will work fine with a similar Shimano 8 or 9 speed chain. If you are dealing with a 10 speed chain I believe you will run into a compatibility problem as one brand is sightly narrower than the other (I can't remember which way and I only deal personally with 9 speed or lower). I've used a SRAM power link on a Shimano HG-40 for a while now with no problems. 

Tire Pressure: Running at the higher range of pressure for your tires will help you avoid bending the rims when you hit holes or other obstacles. Wider Tires: If your brake clearance supports it, you can run slightly wider tires. This will give you a smoother ride at the higher pressures you are running in (1). True the Wheel, Tension the Spokes: Have the wheels professionally trued and the spoke tension equalized. When the wheel is out of true and the spoke tension has marked differences, you are far more likely to break spokes and bend the rims. 

Based on what I saw on the Giant Bicycle site, it looks like that model has braze-ons for attaching a standard rack - so just about any rack will work. My personal favorite for light use (commuting and short tours) would be the Blackburn EX-1. If you need additional support for heavier loads there is a model with an extra support strut. For the panniers, you have a ton of choices and need to weigh factors like size, materials, attachment mechanism, water resistance. My favorite budget panniers are the house-brand bags put out by REI in the US. Novara Transfer Panniers For heavier use, better performance in wet weather, etc, I would recommend you look at bags by Ortlieb and Arkel. If you are really only carrying the bare essentials, and don't need the full packing volume you could use just one pannier, or you could use a 'rack trunk' that sits on top of the rick similar to this one made by Arkel, or the Novara Commuter Rack Trunk. My favorite is the Novara because of the side pockets that fold out and expand into mini-panniers. Good luck with your tour. 

Be patient and use small (1/4 or 1/8) turns of the spoke wrench, and you will have a wheel that is straight and true before you know it. 

As a parent who has been through this with two children and multiple bikes, I would definitely choose the dual sided pedal option (sometimes called "campus pedals"). This has the advantage of needing to only change the pedals once, and not having extraneous parts that can easily get lost. I've personally tried the adapters and never found one I was particularly fond of. When dealing with a child's bike, I would want to avoid anything that could easily get lost. The option to swap out the pedals would be my second choice. It's not hard to do. But it does have a couple drawbacks. You are again dealing with extra parts that can get lost. As well, it's easy to mix up the sides, or cross thread the pedals, and now you are dealing with replacing the crank arms. Finally, most 9 year olds lack the leverage to loosen a tight pedal, so you are going to have to be the one switching them whenever they want to change the ride. I actually use campus pedals on my main commuting bike. That way if I ever decide that instead of riding the whole way home, I am going to take the train to the closest stop and just ride the last 2 miles, it's easy to do in street clothes with my normal shoes.
