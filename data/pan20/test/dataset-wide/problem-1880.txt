I'm in a special situation where myself and 2 long time colleagues have been contracting with a company. After some time of contracting, it was made clear on both sides that the company wanted to bring us all on as normal employees, and this was generally seen as beneficial for all. The process however has moved slow for all involved. After some delay and waiting on written offers we have received verbal offers over the phone. The person delivering the offers was the team manager, but it is clear that he is not the one deciding the numbers or details, just the messenger. He asked for thoughts on the verbal offer, and I gave positive feedback, but also that I'd like to wait for the full details in a written offer to consider it and discuss it further with my wife. The tone was that it was positive but that waiting for a written offer is the next step. The offer was good but needs some negotiation, which due to our relationship with the company will probably be allowed. The problem is that the written offer has been delayed, and I'm worried whether I should have been more vocal initially in stating I needed a higher number. I am also unsure on who to send the negotiation to since the person who delivered the verbal offer doesn't seem to be a decision maker. Should the verbal offer be the start of negotiation, or should one wait for a formal written offer that is likely to come, but is being delayed? Should I assume that the messenger of the verbal offer is my point contact, or try to find the decision maker and go directly? Finally, have I missed my negotiation chance since I didn't immediately respond as such to the verbal offer? 

1) If a recruiter/headhunter proposes a company that another recruiter has already sent your credentials to, let them know directly. This is sort of headhunter etiquette, they will not duplicate or interfere with another's existing lead. They will not be insulted that you're working with someone else and prefer to know then send a duplicate candidate, which makes everyone look bad. 2) If they've both proposed the company but neither has sent your credentials (usually you need to give them permission first), then choose the headhunter you like working with the most and trust the most to negotiate, and tell the other as suggested in (1). 

I've got about 15 years of experience in software engineering, and have worked for a handful of employers at this point. I've done my fair share of interviews at this point as well. Like many software engineers, I've interviewed with larger companies like Google for potential roles. I've interviewed there multiple times over the years, and have not received an offer yet. But about once every 1.5 years they always seem to call me back and I always get curious again. They no longer have me do the phone screen at this point, just come in for another try. This last time I had no trouble with any of the questions, but received a flighty response that I "could have answered faster", and a casual dismissal. My only thought was how I could make my hand write the answers faster next time. The reasoning is usually similar to this, providing little insight, as expected. At what point does this process fail to be effective anymore? If they did not offer me a role the last few times, is it likely they will discover something new in the future? Their recruiting system is a bit of a machine, and I wonder if they are more interested in keeping the pipeline full than providing a meaningful interview process to a candidate. They don't like me enough to hire, but they like me enough to keep interviewing. As a candidate, is it worthwhile to bother with these large tech company interviews that seem to have odds similar to the lottery, and so many qualified candidates that the selectivity becomes absurd? 

I once discovered in a now past role that a junior employee made significantly more than me, as a senior employee. I had about 12 years experience and was hired for this expertise and experience, very quickly by this company for a role they were trying to fill for several months. The salary was good, one that was a bit more than my last. I then found a form that showed a junior employee, 1 year out of college, made 15k more than me. My question might be how to explain this? It's in the development field. Let's assume he had some advanced skill they were seeking. Does that justify what might be twice an average salary for 1 year experience? Is it a matter of better negotiating for him, or poor negotiating for me perhaps? I feel like all this might get him a high junior salary, but this totally surprised me. 

I think this case is best approached by reaching out to the HR contact or company directly to communicate the situation. It sounds like they liked you enough for an offer before, and you can explain to them the nature of why you last-minute.passed on it. You can then express that you found it very interesting, but declined for the personal and unexpected family matter you had. I find people can understand these situations. Be friendly about it. I would be hesitant to just blindly reapply for the position though. They will likely remember you or have you in the system. And in all likelihood if it is for the same position then you may not have to go through all the interview steps again if they are still hiring actively. It is likely you would just need to discuss the situation that happened before and re-assess your interest now. 

Recently I learned my very young company was experiencing financial troubles and most of our staff were given heads up that our jobs could be in serious jeopardy in 1-2 months. Specifically that the startup was running out of money and some expected investors not coming through yet. No one was laid off immediately however. But the prospect was revealed, and could be interpreted as likely by the tone. My intuition is one where I don't want to go down with a sinking ship, and to always have a backup plan for the worst case. I really like the company and benefits, so if I had a choice I'd rather stay-- meaning I'd prefer not to change jobs unless the ship was irrecoverably sinking. I do not want to wait for a layoff before I start interviewing though, as it generally takes time to find a role no matter what. I've started interviewing as a result. As expected, companies ask why I wish to leave as well as time frame for looking for a new position. I usually give a high level description, and that I'm looking for a new role in the timeframe of about 4-6 weeks ahead because my current role is possibly ending then. Some companies have responded, "they will wait for the right candidate for the position". However, I can also see that they would favor a candidate available immediately, who was "all-in" with no question marks about their current company. How should I express my availability to a company in this kind of scenario? Realistically I hope to line up some possible opportunities for the final stages about 4-6 weeks from now and be able to make a best decision then. I am however not ready to accept a position yet without more info on my current company. Should I just pretend I'm ready to switch soon, since most interview processes could take multiple weeks anyway? 

The general rule is that until you have accepted another job and started it, you continue on your current role as if you wanted to keep it forever. This means, even if you are interviewing elsewhere, you're still a star employee at your current company and if interested, you still plan to go to the training. There are a couple reasons for this: 

It is generally quite unprofessional to quit a job by just not showing up. Yes, it can be done, but you're best to avoid this as no good can come from it. It would be nice to give them some time to replace you there, even just another week. You said it was miserable though and going back for even one more weekend is off the table. What I would do is call your manager there or person that hired you and have a very polite conversation that you can't work there anymore. The phone will give you some privacy that you can't get there. Don't tell them it's miserable, maybe just that you've decided to change field of study, or some other commitment came up for your weekends, and you no longer wish to work there. Be nice about it. You could express this with the tone that it's effective immediately, and you won't be able to come in for the weekend. If they're as nice as you say, they'll probably say no big deal and manage for the weekend. Be prepared that they'll ask you to work one last weekend though, and if you really must, come up a reason why you can't ahead of time. Also, if this is a paying job, make sure you confirm or know how you'll be paid for the time you did work. You may need to stop in to collect a check or have it mailed, etc. 

This shows that you've worked with several technologies and effectively used them to build something functional and practical. Such that you could do it again for something an employer needs. The url and source are supplementary, mainly for curiosity sake. If you have any programming experience in your systems work, even in Bash/Perl, etc.. try to work that into that job desc. 

This is more common than you think with recruiters for companies. It is likely a different recruiter who found your skills or resume a good match. If they do keep a log of past interviewees, sometimes they don't check that. I would mention it casually, but just as an FYI and not as a deterrent. Express your interest in moving forward and let them decide how to proceed with all the info. Chances are they have a new role to fill and you're a qualified candidate again. 

Recruiters and initial screening HR people don't really need to know your mailing address to review your qualifications, and aren't likely to need to send you any mail correspondence. Chances are you didn't mail them your resume either. If you submitted it online, or via email, you can likely just use an email address for point of contact. Phone number is optional, depending on how you expect to communicate with them. If they want to set up a phone screen though, they will often just request the best number to reach you at via email. You probably also want to include your region/city of residence though. For instance, just "New York, NY", or "Mountain View, CA", as many places want a local candidate, but they don't need to know which neighborhood you live in. At some point later if the process proceeds, they may request your full mailing address as part of a formal job application form they might use. Or they'll just request it along with other info for the legal/internal parts of the hiring process. 

This depends on the size of the company and how they judge raises and promotions. Often times larger corporations have a standard cost of living wage adjustment (inflation based, roughly), and then some leeway to give a couple extra % to one or two employees per group. Often you have to have performed or accomplished something larger than anyone else in order for you to warrant that extra bit. For Software Engineer I to II, often there are prerequisites for this as well, such as an average of 3-4 years experience between promotional levels (with some rare exceptions), and a larger raise possible for that year, maybe 5%. It is also very possible in your example that you could work for the employer for 20 years and fall way behind market rate with these types of raises. Companies have no obligation to bump you up to a market rate. It depends on the company and culture how this occurs, but often it ends with people staying until they decide to find a better paying position. Switching jobs is a very good way to increase pay dramatically, but you should be prepared to also have something to offer to achieve that. Some possible options: 

I've got an ongoing relationship with a long term business partner as a consultant where his role is project manager (task manager + direction), and my role is a contracted developer. He has a tendency to micromanage my time with his tasks and oversight, but also has a strong sense of perfection. Recently with every single programming task undertaken he is asking me to confirm that I have "100% confidence that this fix will not break any existing features or cause any adverse effects on user experience". If I can't affirm that, he assumes I haven't tested it well enough or should go check it again. And yes, he actually asks this every single bug fix, it isn't just implied. As a developer, I do test my work on multiple unit cases, but can't say that it is possible to fully regression test the entire product for each 2-hour task I accomplish. There is no QA team either. The product has lots of intermingled parts throughout (not just self-contained pages), some 40,000 lines of code written over 4 years, and sometimes unexpected things happen that we weren't even aware of. I sense he sees this as poor testing. How should I respond to his question in this case, without seeming incompetent? Honestly I never have 100% confidence sitewide, but I do have confidence in my testing methods. And, as a developer I also know that it isn't uncommon for unexpected bugs to emerge later from these core changes. EDIT: I'm not necessarily looking for a solution to make this 100%, as our group doesn't have the time or resources to implement a full QA process or get into setting up automated solutions. I'm looking for how to interact with the manager around existing work, especially when he isn't entirely a technical person himself. He isn't a programmer. 

I wouldn't say I'm old, but I'll certainly be getting there soon enough. I was reviewing my resume today, is there ever a point where a job candidate should not list their college years or graduation dates because it is so far back? I've got 4 jobs listed on my resume (spanning 10 years), and it does not include the two jobs before that after college anymore. I've got a top university 4 year degree in my field, but at this point it is at the bottom of the resume after experience. It's dates will forever indicate my age, and I find increasingly speak to initial HR people and colleagues that are several years younger than me these days. Should I remove the years on my college experience or is that inappropriate for a resume? This is not an age discrimination issue as much as it is an appropriateness or normality of excluding years as one gets older. They'll obviously know my age when interviewing me, within a range. 

I would never discount a role as long as you had something left to learn from it. Grow as much as you can in it, and when it has nothing left to offer and you aren't getting the raises you expect, be prepared to look for new challenges and money elsewhere, places willing to pay a market rate. If you keep at this over your medium term career I guarantee you'll be making more money than now, outpacing inflation. 

Usually the best way to politely decline is to ask if something else is a suitable alternative. For instance, I've learned that a linkedIn profile or even a hand crafted CV detailing projects is NOT an appropriate substitute for a code assignment. But a github account is a good use. A github account should have multiple code samples present. The key here is to make sure they are organized, clean and commented with a github README. I use the README section as a small case-study of the project that they can read through to see a description, the challenges, and particularly interesting technologies used. Essentially a detailed walk through. github may be challenging though, as you can't always post employer code there freely, it may be difficult to share group-written code effectively, and personal projects may not be extensive enough to convey the scope of your skills. Finally, a curated github experience is probably more valuable than a completely chaotic commit history with no real narrative about you. The caveat is that employers interviewing multiple candidates with a code assignment are likely to ignore the ones that choose not to do it. Or it would be difficult to compare other completed assignments with your random github code. These code tests are part of the process, but having to do multiple for multiple simultaneous interview tracks that may or may not go anywhere is tedious. As is if you have 10+ years of experience and are being asked to write what isn't more than a Hello World program with some bells and whistles.
