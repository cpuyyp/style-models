There's a regent every other time so at first glance you might think that the regents were always stepping in for under-age rulers, but that is not the case. It's possible that that game designers were led astray by this different use of "regency". These three regents (two of of them widows) are not holding place due to youth of the successor rather for lack of consensus via election. Taking each regent/successor in turn: 

It's interesting to note that a widow's succession is still a common occurrence in politics. In addition to the wikipedia citations here, some background comes from Dan Carlin's delightful podcast series (8+ hours!) Hardcore History: Wrath of the Khans

Dear old Winston is taking a jab at the French here, jokily implying that Englishmen are created in God's image but Frenchmen are later, and lesser creation. 

In his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed Jared Diamond covers a number of cultures that collapsed due to environmental over-exploitation. I don't have my copy handy but if I recall correctly he attributed the collapse of Easter Island to the cutting of native palm trees. He also contrasted the relative prosperity of The Dominican Republic to the poverty of Haiti as partly owing to forest management policies. It's not in the book but I think I similar argument could be made about St Croix (US virgin islands) where they cut all the trees to clear the land for sugar production. After the abolition of slavery sugar production became unprofitable and the island became almost uninhabited. (Am having a hard time finding a source for this as all my searches return touristy results, but I read it when I was on the island). 

On the exact numbers of Tacictus I am being lazy but I am sure that is about right. Check up on it in the various sources I have provided about Tacitus. The kinds of numbers on Tacitus are typical for ancient manuscripts; The Iliad stands out in a class of its own while the gospels stand out in a class above that. Having over 5000 manuscripts with the earliest completed copy being a mere 400 years in from the events, in addition to high accuracy, is impressive. This is a good indication that there is very little perversion in the texts. To make things better there are 10's of thousands of manuscripts from roughly the 10th century in Latin vulgate that match with the same accuracy, further, translators will tell you that they are pretty true to the Greek manuscripts as well. Also, Codex Vaticanus is significant because it is nearly complete and dates 100 years earlier than Sniaiticus. If this is not enough to trust that there is little or no perversion then I don't think anything will be for any ancient text. There is another important thing to consider, regarding the manuscripts and authorship dates. Most scholars agree that the NT was written in this order. Epistles, synoptic gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Gospel of John, Revelation. It has been highly argued and supporting this claim right now is outside the scope of this question and possibly the site as well. Consider the following quote from a wikipedia article: 

Tocqueville originally didn't talk of a mere "experiment" at all. Instead, the french original (De la démocratie en Amérique, Paris: Gosselin, 1835, p. 41) has the following lines (emphasis mine): 

I've found it on on Jamila's blog, with an overview of iraqi coins. There, it's described as follows: 

It's a sistrum and a bowl (patera or phiale) used for libation. The sistrum, a musical instrument used as a rattle, isn't restricted to the cult of Isis; you may encounter it also in the context of the cult of Mithras, too. See also the Encyclopedia Britannica on the sistrum. For the sistrum, cf. this statue of Isis: 

At least the bottle, the glass, the pewter pitcher (??), the pot containing something sugar cubes (???) and the dish with some fruit (lemons???), are expected to be placed on the table. So, they may indicate that one or more tables had to be removed so there's enough free space to dance (since it's a penny wedding, people had to use the present venue for the banquet even it's quite cramped for such an occasion). It may also indicate the point of time shown on the picture - at the end or after the banquet, the dancing has just begun. 

Additional note: there's a great overview of Alexis de Tocqueville's writings available online, provided by the UPenn library: $URL$ There are also translations to different languages as well as the french original.

Excluding the claims that Jesus was resurrected, I say that there is no reason to doubt the events detailed in the Gospels. The first thing that should be mentioned is the possibility of textual 'perversion' from the original texts. Historians commonly use a method called the bibliographical test. The test is quite simple and is meant to show the relative reliability, as textual preservation is concerned, to other historically accepted manuscripts. First, the you must choose a few manuscripts to compare. We will of course include the new testament gospels (as a whole but we could split it up but that is a lot of work). Then lets throw in Homer's Iliad, from which we gain much knowledge of ancient Greece, and the writtings of Tacitus, from which we gain much knowledge of ancient Rome. After choosing the manuscripts we compare the earliest known manuscripts and the total number of manuscripts and the similarities between manuscripts. A more complicated version also considers where the manuscript was found, which is significant for ancient times for a number of reasons (but I am disinterested in makeing this answer too long simply because I will likely not get much rep from it ;) 

This prominent international banker is commonly quoted this. First, did he actually say it? Second, what was its context (when and where was he and what other things did he say shortly before or after this) if we know? Finally, seeing as how this is likely his most notable quote, did he ever reflect on it at a later time shedding some light on it? 

Photo taken by Marie-Lan Nguyen (2006), Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons For the libation ceremony, cf. this statue of a priest in toga offering libation: 

At least, his whereabouts were known to the allied war crimes prosecution authorities: General Müller was interrogated during the preparation of the Nuremberg trials by the "Military Division" of the OCCWC (Office, Chief of Counsel for War Crimes) in 1947 and 1948; the Institut für Zeitgeschichte München (Institute of Contemporary History, Munich) provides a transcript of that interrogations together with some affidavits (no. ZS [Zeugenschrifttum] 1244, PDF). It seems that he was called as witness by the defense in the "High Command Trial" („Prozess Oberkommando der Wehrmacht / OKW-Prozess“), one of the "Subsequent Nuremberg Trials" („Nachfolgeprozesse“): see the the "List of Witnesses in Case 12", "Green Series" vol XI p. 705. See also: Helmut Krausnick, Kommissarbefehl und „Gerichtsbarkeitserlass Barbarossa“ in neuerer Sicht, in: Vierteljahreshefte für Zeitgeschichte 1977, Heft 4, p. 682-738. 

So, "great experiment" wasn't used by Tocqueville at all - he simply wrote "devaient essayer" - "should attempt (to build...)". Modern translations usually stick to to french original. So, A. Goldhammer translated in 1994: 

Regarding place and date: The picture was taken in Blaubeuren, Germany. In the background, a part of the Blaubeuren Abbey is visible (its western portal): 

Source: Wikipedia Commons, Schilling Thomas (Own Work) [CC BY-SA 4.0] ($URL$ The place is about 100 meters south of the „Blautopf“, a famous little pond in Blaubeuren; today, the street is named „Blautopfstraße“. Guessing by the shadows cast, the photo was taken around noon. Maybe, the photo depicts Hitler's visit in Blaubeuren where he had lunch on September 5th 1933 (according to Sandner's „Itinerar“), on occasion of his stay in Ulm where he attended a maneuver of the 5. Reichswehrregiment on September 5th and 6th, 1933 (this may explain the presence of high-ranking military people at that place and time). There are archival sources about a meeting between Hitler and some high-ranking Reichswehr officers at Ulm: Werner von Blomberg, General Kurt von Hammerstein, Generalleutnant Curt Liebmann and General Hans Freiherr Seutter von Lötzen. Guessing by a slightly better (but cropped) version of that photo (that was also available as picture postcard: see here and here), the person at Hitler's left may be Werner von Blomberg (wearing his "Pour le Mérite"?), at that time Minister of Defense. The person at the very right of the photo may be Heinrich Himmler (???). Regarding Goebbels: It seems that he didn't accompany Hitler to Ulm but returned to Berlin after attending the Nuremberg Rally from August 30 to September 3, 1933.
