If a sent-off player refuses the leave the field of play and the match is unable to continue as a result, the match is abandoned, and this is reported to the competition administrator. The referee has no power to declare a forfeit - they simply report the facts of the match, and the competition administrator makes a determination on the outcome in accordance with the competition rules as stipulated in Law 7 - The Duration of the Match, Section 5 - Abandoned Match: 

Here are the relevant sections of the Laws of The Game: Law 5 - The Referee, Section 3 - Powers and Duties: 

There are two offences in which contact is not made with an opponent that cause an indirect free kick to be awarded: 

You state that the referee declared this match a draw, but this is not possible. Matches only proceed to extra time and kicks from the penalty mark if a draw is not an available outcome. Law 10 - Determining the Outcome of a Match, Section 2 - Winning Team: 

In the game of association football, the ball is always out of play when it crosses the line either in the air or on the ground. It never has to hit the ground to be out, like in other forms of football, such as rugby. From page 33, 2014/15 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

A direct free kick / penalty kick is awarded if the action is reckless, and the player is also cautioned for unsporting behaviour. p. 123 of the 2014/15 FIFA Laws of The Game 

It also serves a number of other purposes. It limits how close to the opponents' goal an indirect free kick may be taken from. On p. 42 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: 

In Formula 1 racing, the following scoring system is used to determine the winning drivers and constructors: 

IFAB, the organisation responsible for changes to the Laws of the Game, up until recently, only met annually and required a 75% supermajority to change any Law. As a result, changes to the Laws have always been very minor. This is why, in spite of there being better timing technology available and more budget to train and pay a separate timekeeper at the highest levels of the game, this area of the game hasn't changed since additional time was introduced decades ago in 1987. However, as of 2014, this has changed, with IFAB now having two panels that consistently are trialling and studying the impact of changes to the Laws through the year. The recommendations are presented to IFAB, leaving IFAB's members to more or less rubber stamp new changes. It is possible that the method of timing at the highest levels of the game may change in the near future, even though it seems unlikely that it will change at the amateur level. It is worth noting in some amateur competitions, due to scheduling constraints, there is no allowance for added time at all. 

If the shirt pulling also breaks up or interferes with a promising attack, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour. Law 12.4: 

However, there is no prohibition on granting permission after the fact, or allowing implicit permission. There are many times where this should be done, eg. if a player: 

The referee would stop play and restart with a dropped ball to be taken from where the ball was located when play was stopped (unless the ball was within the goal area - it would then be brought to the nearest point on the goal area line parallel to the goal line). On p. 74 of the 2014/15 FIFA Laws of The Game (relevant passage in italics): 

As mentioned, referees will record goals, substitutions and cautions and send-offs in their books throughout the match. Referees will also keep track of injuries, number switches between players (e.g. defender switching shirt with goalkeeper), team official misconduct, any further misconduct by sent-off players and any extraordinary circumstances that need reporting to the competition administrator such as: 

The correct decision here is an indirect free kick to the opponents. This is also the case if the goalkeeper receives the ball outside the penalty area with his feet, dribbles it back into the penalty area, and handles it. 

What do careless, reckless and excessive force mean, and do these have any affect on other sanctions (eg. cards) that a player might receive? 

If when a ball is stuck from close by or with speed, a player has made the additional effort to pull their arm in close to their body to avoid the ball making contact with it, and it still somehow makes contact, this further reduces the likelihood that that the handling is deliberate. However, if the ball comes slowly or from far away (meaning the player has plenty of time avoid handling the ball) most referees will assume that because the player chose to let the ball hit their hand / arm, this is deliberate handling, even if their arm / hand is against their body. Another form of deliberate handling that should be called is when a player places their hand against their torso, and then throws their torso at the ball, ensuring the hand makes contact with the ball. In this case, the hand / arm is against the body, but is deliberately brought in contact with the ball. asktheref.com discussed cases of deliberate handling when the arm is against the body in great detail in questions 30887 and 28824. Obviously a lot of their views are personal opinions, but it gives some good insight into how current and active referees handle (excuse the pun) these calls. 

This is contrast to offences which actively harm the opponents' ability to play should and hence should come under the guise of persistent infringement. Examples of this include repeatedly fouling opponents, encroaching at a penalty kick forcing a retake multiple times, consistently holding opponents at a corner kick before the ball is in play. 

The team will continue to play with the same number of players they had on the field at the time the substitute or substituted player was sent off. If a substitute is sent-off before the match begins, they cannot be replaced with a reserve player who was not named in the line-up. p. 21 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

In football, there is a strong tradition that the referee is responsible and accountable for every single decision. This is due to the fact that historically (and even at the lowest levels of the game at present) there was only one neutral official present at a game. Tasking a single official with stopping and starting a clock every time the ball went out as well as supervising and indicating the restart of play would make officiating a very difficult task, hence why it is a discretionary process. Furthermore, additional time was added in football only to combat deliberate time-wasting, and time lost due to injuries, substitutions and disciplinary action. It was never intended to be used to add on time simply due to the ball being out of play. Up until that point, a match was exactly two periods of 45 minutes, and this included when the ball was out of play. This is still the way it is today. Law 7.3 - The Duration of the Match, Allowance for time lost: 

As for a referee contacting a player, there is nothing explicitly written in the Laws about this. However, the only way a free kick or penalty kick can be awarded to a team in football, is if a player, substitute or substituted player on the other team commits an infringement, so this is out of the question. As for a potential dropped ball restart, this would only occur if the player and/or referee was injured as a result of the collision. Page 31 covers when a dropped ball is appropriate: 

The Laws do not specifically account for this type of incident, as technically speaking, it should not occur. If it does occur, the referee needs to send-off the player as soon as they realise, even if it means stopping play to do so (unless the other team has a clear goalscoring opportunity and advantage can be played - in this case it is dealt with when the player to be sent-off interferes with play or an opponent). 

In a lot of challenges, contact is made with an opponent both before and after the ball is won. Whether it rises to the level of careless (or worse) usually depends on a number of things (and can depend on how/when the ball was won) - eg. 

It may be easier to list only the offences that result in a penalty kick being awarded (ie. direct free kick offences), as there are a lot less of them. The vast majority of possible infringements result in an indirect free kick, in spite of direct free kick offences being far more common. A number of the other answers have focused only on Law 12 offences, however, there are many others that result in an indirect free kick. This answer will endeavour to list them all in light of recent changes to the Laws. Pertinent changes have been emphasised. An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team if: 

Players politely and calmly appealing for decisions is an accepted part of the game - however, protesting decisions once they have been made is not (in spite of what you may see at the elite levels of the game). The referee should simply say 'no' and move on. If players continue to appeal, argue, or remonstrate beyond this point, they are then protesting and have crossed the line to dissent. This is highlighted on p. 126 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

This "Spirit" that is spoken of is now a formal part of the Laws of the Game (as of 1st June 2016). In Law 5.2 - The Referee, Decisions of the Referee: 

The provision in Law 5 regarding not changing a decision once play has restarted does not apply here for two reasons: 

Finally, if the defending team is awarded a free kick (either direct or indirect) in their goal area, they may take it from any point in the goal area. On p. 42 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of The Game: 

Yes. Not only is it a foul to attempt a reckless tackle, it is also misconduct, resulting in a caution for unsporting behaviour. From p. 37 of the 2015/16 FIFA Laws of the Game: 

As you can see, not all of these careless / reckless / excessive force offences require contact. If the referee believes a player has attempted to make reckless contact with an opponent instead of challenging for the ball, but has done so without making contact with an opponent, a direct free kick will be awarded for recklessly attempts to trip an opponent or recklessly attempts to kick an opponent. If the referee believes the player has attempted to play the ball in a reckless manner, but has done so without making contact with the opponent, a direct free kick will be awarded for recklessly tackles an opponent. If these offences occur in the penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded. On the same page, after the other three direct free kick offences, it states: 

However, after all has been said, if a referee decides that they haven't provided implicit or after-the-fact permission, and the player has deliberately left the field (and it was not part of a natural playing movement) they are well within their rights to caution the player. They of course then must wear the consequences of that decision. 

In 2016/17, the word "challenges" was added to this offence, to indicate that referees should not just be looking at "tackles", but all contests for the ball. Given the definitions of careless, reckless and excessive force, it seems plausible that swinging a foot within centimetres of an opponent's head as they're trying to play the ball, resulting in a near-miss, could be considered careless at the very least. The other advantage of taking this approach, is that the referee does not need to wait and see if the opponent is prevented from playing the ball by the challenge. As soon as the challenge occurs, as long as it is careless, reckless, or excessively forceful the direct free kick may be awarded. As described in this answer, if the challenge is careless, just the direct free kick is awarded; if reckless, the player concerned is also cautioned for unsporting behaviour. Finally, if there is excessive force, the player concerned is sent-off for serious foul play (assuming it was a challenge for the ball). 

Only you as the referee can decide which category this falls into. If you somehow come to the conclusion that both players have fouled, the free kick should be awarded to the team of the player who was culpable for the most physical severity, as quoted above. To address some of the specific points in your question: 

in order to be able to complete the send-off report. When completing send-off reports for a second caution, if either or both of the cautions are for unsporting behaviour, as a courtesy, I will also provide the form of unsporting behaviour from Law 12.3 under the Cautions for unsporting behaviour section - e.g. recklessly kicked an opponent, carelessly tripped an opponent to interfere with or stop a promising attack - if I can remember it (I never have forgotten in ten years of refereeing, as it would be extremely unlikely for there to be more than one, or at most two send-offs in a match). However, this is strictly not required in the leagues I referee in. 

The referee simply reports what occurred (a mistake of this magnitude would certainly be reported as an "incident"), and if any goals were scored, etc. with the player remaining on the field, and the competition administrator would apply the appropriate competition rules. This is a misapplication of the Laws of the Game, so if it had any impact on the match, the only fair outcome would be a replay, as the culpable party here is the referee, not either team. Most competition rules that I'm aware of either stipulate a replayed match in this instance where it had an effect on the result or leave it at the discretion of the competition administrator. If left in the hands of a competition administrator, in my experience, most competition administrators would make the decision to replay the match if the result was affected by such a misapplication of the Laws. 

This is a misconception. Players are injured all the time from perfectly legal challenges. Players should be punished based on the amount of risk (i.e. careless, reckless or excessive force) to an opponent when making a challenge, not whether an opponent is injured as a result of the challenge. Finally, as for whether the offence requires a caution, sending-off, or just a free kick - that is covered in this question. 1 - While this decision divided fans, most referees were of the opinion that the challenged endangered the safety of an opponent and the send-off for serious foul play was justified.
