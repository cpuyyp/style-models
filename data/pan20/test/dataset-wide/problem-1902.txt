I work as a senior software engineer in Germany. In the last 6 years, I had at least 25 interviews. I was asked only once a puzzle question. Needless to say, whole interview was quite odd. My experience is that people do not ask puzzle questions anymore. At least not in IT sector. For example, in google “What works well are structured behavioral interviews, where you have a consistent rubric for how you assess people”. Even microsoft, where the puzzle questions were born, stopped asking such questions since they realized it is a waste of time. There is this famous article "What would Feynman do?", which discredit such questions in quite a funny way. 

I live in Germany, and I have seen several resumes where people wrote that they hold German citizenship (or are entitled to work in Germany). As you, they have foreign names. People put this under personal data. See this example. Although it may be a bit weird in US, I have also seen people putting place of birth. 

I am working as a Software Engineer and I'm a hobbyist photographer. The organization I'm working for carries out a corporate social responsibility program. Last month we had an event under this program and I photographed the event. (It was a gathering of orphan kids and old age people and some fun activities with them that were conducted in the office cafeteria premiss). I did not ask for any payment from my employer for shooting this event, as I don't find asking money for a charity event going well with my own self. This morning I got an email from CEO office that he liked the pictures and would like me to shoot an assignment for the company. This assignment involves shooting portraits of a few employees. I don't think it is appropriate for me to do this for free. I have developed photography as a skill over past three years. I have worked hard and invested a lot of time and money over this. I believe I am pretty much skilled and capable of delivering great photographs if asked to shoot. Is this appropriate if I ask for monetary rewards for this assignment? Is it professional to bring this up to my employer. Edit: I am based in India. The company wants me to take a couple of hours off and shoot for them in normal working hours. Regarding the culture, I am not aware if the company pays employees if it asks for additional services. There is a "fun committee" that voluntarily organizes activities (with organization-provided budget, of course). There is another committee for organizing CSR activities and yet another committee for organizing sports activities. All these committee members are employees who work voluntarily taking time off from their normal working hours. Their contribution is counted in their annual performance reviews also. For many such events professional photographers are hired and paid accordingly. After I shot the last CSR event (for free) they seemed to have discovered a decent photographer in the organization itself. Moreover, this assignment involves some serious photography skills and equipment (that I own). I will have to make additional efforts and expenses to carry this to the assignment location. Edit 2 I have replied to the mail from CEO office and asked for time for an informal discussion over this with the person in charge of such activities. She will be in the office in about three hours from now. 

Since other answers tell that it is acceptable, I can only assume they never worked in an open office. Or noise do not disturb them. I worked and I know how bad it can be. And no headphone is going to help you. That being said, I would throw you and your duck out of the window as soon as you start talking to it in open space. It is absolutely unacceptable to add additional disruption and noise to an environment that is already bad enough. If you have to talk to your duck, go close yourself in a meeting room (or whatever you got there), and discuss without disturbing your colleagues further. 

I did some interviews in Germany, and it varied. Some are paying only public transport, but not taxis. For one interview I had to take taxi, otherwise would be late. And they didn't cover it later. But other company covered everything. You can always ask them before coming for an interview. 

It is a common practice here in India to show the total possible cost for yourself as the CTC. This cost is not what you get in hand or not what you get on the salary slip but what you were offered in your offer letter or increment letter. Take the following example: 

And you have to mention the overtime rates separately. When you provide your salary slips, all the fixed components are mentioned on it, along with the overtime. You don't have to include overtime in your CTC as it is already covered in the salary slips. The companies in India make offers based on verified salary slips and not on what CTC amount you tell them. If your salary slip shows overtime income more than your basic pay, the new employers would make an offer accordingly. Furthermore, you can always negotiate your salary before a formal offer is made. 

When it comes to it, only your manager can approve it. Therefore, the only answer is to talk to your manager. But I see one good benefit : your solution to your problem may not be the best, and when you write it, someone will read it and write you comments (code or idea review). Of course, I assume you are not over doing it. SE shouldn't interfere with your every day duties and your work. 

Yes, you and your coleague are doing it wrong. You will be able to work long hours for some time, but after you will start feeling exhaustion, being stressed out, and finaly the burnout. The quality of your work will worsen, and finaly you are going to become sick. If you work in an open office, the things are just going to be worse. Working more than 40 hours per week increases 'burnout' risk (read the comments how people gets hearth and other diseases, starts office fight, etc). Why Working More Than 40 Hours a Week is Useless : 

Now this depends upon what experience you mention you have in first place. If the times you have worked don't add up then the recruiter will express a doubt. These doubts could be on various topics like experience gaps, academic gaps, and so on. Perhaps you may have done consultancy work, volunteering or something similarly useful but if you don't show that in your resume, it lets enough room for doubt. So, first thing that you should do is show all your experience, relevant or otherwise, on your CV. Next, about the gaps, I must tell my personal experience. I worked at a place for three months on contract and then was asked to resign because I had failed in my final year exams. In the next six months I cleared those papers and got another job. Later when I went looking for a better job, a lot of recruiters asked me the reason behind the gap. Most of the times I'd tell them the half-truth - that it was a contract job. The next question was inevitable- "How can we trust you if you can hop a job in months?" That would always leave me speechless. Finally once I told a recruiter the whole truth- that I failed and got fired. They did not grill me further, instead hired me for the profile I wanted and a pay beyond my expectations. Sometimes it is best we tell the whole truth. 

As you said, you did everything you could. So, just relax and let the people in higher management perform their plans. That includes stopping to secretly work on this project. Let the people doing the communication with the client inform them that there are higher priority tasks, or whatever they want to say. As for your carrier and reputation - I see nothing wrong. If you are performing your tasks, your reputation will not be damaged. 

Contrary to other answers, I would say "No, it is not necessary". From the job description, it should be clear that the job require certain level of a language proficiency. The person passing you the CVs should be capable enough to filter candidates on such trivial requirement.
