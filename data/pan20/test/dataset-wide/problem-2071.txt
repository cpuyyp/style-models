You have to be careful with this as when they contact the companies you worked for they may tell them a differnt title. What I did was use my offical title and then follow it in () with the real title of the work I was actually doing. I had to do this because my offical title in one company was not even in the same general profession as the actual work. I usually explained this in the cover letter or interview if anyone asked. That got the key words out there for the HR filter and was not lying. 

Your coworkers are jerks. What you described is not a normal reaction to a one time mistake. I would guess that the person you offended told them something other than what happened to make them so upset. These people are not worth working with if they still haven't gotten over this mistake over the course of more than a couple of days. There is now no way that you you can gain their trust back and they will sabotage you at every chance. Your best bet is to leave. Leave knowing you made a mistake, but that they made a much larger one. This is not totally your fault. Don't let this put you off being friends with co-workers though. It is better to have friends than not in a workplace. I have never worked anywhere that this type of mistake would get someone ostracised like this, so they are an outlier. Once you leave, don't give another moment's thought to these people, they are not worth you spending your time trying to figure out what you could have done differently. Also do not make the assumption not to respond to things by email, it is often best to have a paper trail. The thing you should learn from this is not to send emails when you are mad. Having a phone conversation when you are mad can be just as disastrous. Usually what I do is write the email taking care to not put anyone in the TO block. Then I can safely write everything I want to say with no way it can accidentally be sent. Once I get my mad out safely, it is usually easier to write a more professional response calmly. 

I see several possibilities. The first is that you need to learn to play office politics and the new employee is currently using them against you and you need to learn how to fight back and restore your reputation. Likely she is aiming at your job. You should probably get a good book on office politics and read it throroughly and practice what it says. The subject is pretty complex and I can't write a thorough answer on a forum like this. At a minimum you need to start making sure your successes are visible to managment. You also need to publicly compliment her work. You also need to consider if you have been acting in such a way as to make things harder for her which is why she has chosen to go above you and if so stop that. Are you refusing to share information? Did you try to be friendly towards her? The final possibility is one you can't fight and it is usualy best to move on. That is that the new woman is someone your boss is having an affair with or wants to have an affair with. The reason I strongly suspect this is because the new person seemed able to turn around opinons on you so quickly when you already had an established reputation. That indicates she has more influence than a new employee normally has. 

You have a couple of issues here that need to be dealt with separately. If you are in the US @randomblink is giving you some good advice about FMLA. However, the protection could be a problem if the business itself has less than 50 employees. Call them. If you are in another country, there must be an equivalent to the Department of Labor that manages labor laws in that country. Look them up and call them to inquire about your legal protections in such a case. But really the problem you need to address, especially in the US where most employment is at will, is your performance while you have these pressures. I know it is hard, I have been a caregiver, but you have to learn to leave everything at home when you come to work and perform to the best of your ability while you are there. You need to have things set up so that someone else can take over if you get called away for an emergency. It is stressful I know, so if you need to cry, take a break and go hide in the ladies room to cry. Since you say your husband is unemployed and depressed, your job is critical to your family and you need to prioritize doing it well when you are there. Even though he is depressed, can your husband take on being the contact point and only calling you in if there is such an emergency that you have to go right then? Can you delay going to the hospital until after work? This would help you out and might make him feel more useful. Try to make other arrangements to make up the time as well. Maybe you could go sometimes at lunch, take a slightly longer lunch and then stay later that night? Maybe you could make arrangements to work from home if there is physical care you need to do sometimes (or in order to make up the hours). Think about what kind of a plan you could make to help the work get done while you are off with the emergency. Perhaps you need to cross train some people. The office is going to be more lenient if you have a plan. When there is no emergency, make an effort to put in more effort than usual. The better you perform when there is no emergency, the more slack the office will give you when there is. Others are taking up the slack for you, when you can, try to return the favor which will make them more willing to help you out. But even then, I have seen good employees let go if it goes on too long especially at a smaller company that has less room for others to pick up the load. After all they have to get the work done and they can't replace you unless you are gone. So even though it will be difficult with your husband unemployed, you need to start creating a financial cushion it case this happens. Reduce your spending as much as possible. Put as much as you can into a savings account, you may well need it 2-3 months down the road. You may also need to look at reducing your 401K contributions. Yeah that is unfair, but losing your home because you were saving for retirement isn't really a great choice. Most people with depression work, so don't let that become an excuse to not try to find work. Once those antidepressants kick in (it can take up to a month unfortunately), it needs to become a priority. If he has a hobby like woodworking or is good at repair work, you might also consider if he can make some money while he is looking through a small home-based business. Anything he can do to reduce the burden you are under will help. And see if you can find a caregivers support group. You need someone you can unburden yourself to and they may have tips for how to manage working through this. 

While I agree with many of the answers, occasionally you run into someone who just refuses to believe that you have done any work unless they see a finished product. You have to remember that many non-technical people have no idea how much code it takes to produce a product. They think the final page in the application is the whole thing. So if there is no page, then no work has been done. In that case, I inundate them with the code I have done and the documentation of the research I have done. After you have shown them that you have thousands of lines of code, hundreds of database tables you have set up, and hundreds of pages of research, they will leave you alone. The key to this is not to try explain the code or research step by step but just to show them how much of it there is and offer to go through it with them (they will generally decide they don;t really need to do this once faced with actual code which is completely mysterious to them). Note this is a special case, you do not want to do this for the average non-technical manager, but only for the ones who refuse to believe you have done anything after multiple times of trying to explain at a non-technical level. I have had to do this a couple of times when trying to fix a complex bug as well and the non-technical person doesn't get why you can't do it in five minutes. Generally after they have seen the complexity of the code (which they do not understand so it is very intimidating to them), they start to learn to trust your judgement. 

It's not important what they are charging for your services and bringing that up would not likely result in a raise. What could help however is that the client obviously thinks you are performing at the senior level. So you could bring up that the client said they were happy with your performance and that they felt as if they were getting senior level performance from you. Of course a written note from the client on how happy they are with your performance will go farther than an anecdote about a conversation you had. I always pass anything positive my client says in writing on to my boss, so when it is raise time (and keep them in a separate email folder), he can see what good things the client sees in my performance. It is nice to be able to point out in your self appraisal that you have gotten X number of pieces of written positive feedback from your client(s). 

These are often not the kind of mistakes that drive the need for a massive effort to do post-mortem analysis. But they do drive the need to deal with the individual who is making more than the occasional mistake. So let's deal with some of those possibilities. I'm going to lump incompetence and carelessness together as the process to deal with them is similar. First, explain to the person, what was wrong, why it was wrong and how to do it correctly. Then make the person make the fix. If they learn from this and don't continue to make the same mistake, then that's all that is needed. But people being people, this won't fix everyone. Some people will need private counseling about their problems and why they keep making them and may need to be put formally on a plan to fix their lack of skill or caring about the quality of their work. This needs to be a plan with consequences. If the person doesn't shape up after giving several chances to fix the problems they have, then you may need to let them go. And they need to know this is a possibility if they don't fix what is wrong. It should never come as a surprise if you are getting let go for lack of performance. But that first talk shouldn't be the kiss of death either, if the person straightens up and improves, it should be possible to come off the performance improvement plan and be treated the same as the other employees. Now in the processing of the private discussions to find out why the mistakes are happening, you may find that distraction, exhaustion, or personal stress are involved. If distraction is causing a problem, then as a manager, you need to fix whatever is causing the distraction. That might mean not expecting the person to multitask, it might mean moving to a quieter location, it might mean having someone else handle technical questions or help desk calls or what ever is the thing that keeps pulling the person off task. Then see if performance improves. If exhaustion is involved (and is work-related), the manager probably is the one who made the mistake and should have noticed that the person was working too many hours. If the person is working more than 8 hours in a day, send him home and tell him not to come back until he has slept a full night. Then stop planning tasks so that they require more than 40 hours a week. Employee exhaustion is often the result of management errors. So take the blame and fix the problem. Now sometimes an employee is exhausted due to other issues outside of work and those will come under the next paragragh discussing personal stresses. If the person tells you of outside reasons why he is making mistakes, then you need to assess those reasons and come up with a plan to mitigate them. Sometimes this means a short-term lightening of the load (as was done for me when my beloved died), sometimes it might mean moving to a less stressful position permanently (in the case of someone who will be under the stress for a long time, such as when somone has become a caregiver), it may mean checking their work more frequently. It might mean a change of schedule. It might mean putting him on medical leave or short term disability or part-time hours. It may mean telling him to quit that second job or requiring they get medical treatment for depression or insomnia or a whole host of other things. Anytime you need to go one step up from just having the talk about the mistake and how to fix it or the identification of a personal stressor that is affecting work that can't be fixed by a simple short-term rearrangement of work, you may need to get HR involved before you deal with the person directly. They are aware both of legal issues you may not be aware of and of possible resources (as well as ways and means as to how to do somthing like put someone on short-term disability) and company policies you need to follow. They are the manager's friend when there is serious performance problem that needs to be addressed.
