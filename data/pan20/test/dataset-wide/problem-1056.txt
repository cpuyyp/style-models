When is issued on a Slave, the Master authenticates the DB Thread coming from the Slave and assign one thread on the Master. The thread on the Master will ship binary log entries to the I/O Thread on the Slave. The I/O Thread on the Slave is assigned to for handling communcation between Master and Slave. The SQL Thread on the Slave is also assigned to for handling intracommunication of local relay log entries to be processed FIFO (Frist In, First Out) by mysqld running on the Slave. No direct access is permitted via the MySQL Client on the Slave except for 

You could dump the queries to a text file, and follow up with That is all that MySQL currently exposes for InnoDB's internal metadata. Here are all the table structures 

First, let's make sure MySQL evens runs properly apart from the service. Open a DOS Window Session and run these commands 

If you import data and it seemingly disappears, you need to check the indexes on that table. You should do the following: 

You need three changes CHANGE #1 Add after end CHANGE #2 Just insert NEW. directly into CHANGE #3 Make it an AFTER INSERT trigger, to be sure the new lands in 

Although this may be an oversimplification to say, this allows functions to be allowed to write data into binary logs without strictly enforcing the DETERMINISTIC property. ASPECT #2 : Triggers should be able to be rolled back 

and see if the reports multiple files If there is only one , then is most likely in the wrong folder. It should be in one of the following places 

As an alternative, change the password. Don't give the developers the new password. OPTION #4 TELL THE DEVELOPERS DON'T USE THE PAGER !!! Human nature is the hardest to program, eh ??? Give it A Try !!! 

You will have to restart mysql for this to take effect. Give it a Try !!! CAVEAT : Your data integrity will deteriorate when added new data because many INSERT queries or multiple-row INSERTs will fail because of just one row not having parent keys. You should really consider loading all referenced tables into the slave to have good, clean data. Otherwise, it's not a true copy of the Master. 

Checking time differences already calculated is better for performance than calculating it for every row. Give it a Try !!! 

The first GA version of MySQL 5.5.8. You are using MySQL 5.5.6-rc You need to get the latest version of MySQL 5.5 

Let's look at many perspectives PERSPECTIVE #1 : SELECTs against MyISAM tables If you are doing only SELECTs, you need to run this query: 

STEP 02 Run . If the file exists, rename it with Then, copy your into STEP 03 See if you have a previous mysql setup 

Some compression is happening to data that is being inserted. If your file is growing, it must be doing some compression related work on every in terms of encoding/encryption. Note the Technical Details says under the subheading : 

The first method is the best because of the least overhead for the queries generated. In fact, in the MySQL Stored Procedure Language, you want as few declared variables as possible. The second is not possible since the MySQL Stored Rrocedure Language does not have object support. A clumsy but workable UPDATE JOIN is possible if you... 

That way you can logically group together all binary logs that have the same date when formulating any needed incremental backup. You do not have record times or positions in this respect: If you include the option in the mysqldump, the log file and position at recorded as a comment on line 22 of the mysqldump output. QUESTION #3 

You will see a list of relay logs MySQL Replication needs and rotates. If is not in , you can delete without breaking anything. Why is is still around ? It could be anything. Between setting up replication after an outrage, skipping SQL Errors, and just plain Starting and Stopping, along with a low expire_logs_days could leave one or more relay logs lingering. In light of these things, if a relay log does not appear in , you can delete it. Why is the relay log so empty ? It has to do with the mechanism Replication uses to rotate to the next relay log. You will not see these annoying little files very often. The only time I usually see them is with one of the following: 

You could capture the mysqld's uptime or the DB Server's time at the start and end of your code. Perhaps something like this SUGGESTION #1 

Both queries will display the same result, but the second query will do less work and take less processing to achieve. 

DISCLAIMER : MySQL Fabric is new to me so I cannot say much. Notwithstanding, the FAQ for MySQL Fabric says the following: 

Try removing the index so as to speed up INSERTs and UPDATEs. ALTERNATE SUGGESTION Try out your temp table solution using another method STEP 01) STEP 02) Do your bulk INSERTs into STEP 03) STEP 04) Perform count on the latest bulk INSERT batch 

SUGGESTION #1 First, stop the App from Logging. Next, you need to find the last 10 million ids and get the minimum value. Then, create a temp table with the 10 million rows of those IDs starting from that minimum. 

Recommendation RAID10 not only provides stability but allows some leeway in disk maintenance without taking mysql down in most cases. When data is mirrored, you know where the data is going and you know from where the data is being read. UPDATE 2012-02-14 17:55 EDT After reading your question update, I would say go with RAID10. Unless you do not mind long periods of downtime, you cannot afford to do RAID5 disk maintenance in lieu disk syncing. In fact, the smaller the disks you stripe in RAID10, the faster the sync time would be after a RAID 10 disk maintenance. Other things to consider 

and you want to do the . Here are your steps to update the city based on id: Step 01) Create another table to use for the import 

FINAL WORD Doing this may increase read I/O. You may also want to consider setting innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 0 to keey the innodb buffer pool with the freshest data that is as fully flushed to disk as possible. Step 1) Add this to the /etc/my.cnf 

This sounds very unusual for a table using the ARCHIVE Storage Engine. Why? A duplicate key error is not characteristic for ARCHIVE Storage Engine since 

Based on the MySQL Documentation on , the MySQL Query Optimizer performs subquery optimization by means of converting a subquery as follows: 

Give it a Try !!! UPDATE 2013-03-22 13:04 EDT You can also check other metadata tables such as TABLE_CONSTRAINTS 

This should prompt you for the password. Enter new password and you should be in. ALTERNATIVE Instead of creating , do the following after you have shutdown MySQL 

Sounds like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. Just kidding. I just cringe when I see MyISAM. I can tell you what the MySQL Documentation says. Please note what it says:
