You want the least change needed? How about: When Theodore Roosevelt was hunting in central and south America, he fell in love with llamas. Once he was president, he added a law saying that everyone had to own a llama during their 44th year. This would have had minimal impact since the average lifespan was lower then and most people who lived to 44 years old were well off. The majority of the people would have seen it as a joke on the rich. 

You are putting the city right about where the ozone layer is (see this wiki). Most weather would happen below the city. However, we have a heat problem. Underneath the city, we would either cook or freeze (I doubt the two sources of heat will balance evenly). We get heat from two sources, the Sun and our radioactive, molten core. The city will block the heat from the Sun and the Earth's heat will be reflected back from the underside of the city. Now, assuming the alien's technology is good enough that they can exactly balance the two so the Earth's heat gain/loss rate remains the same, weather, as we know it will stop. The differential heating from the Sun will no longer be a factor for driving weather. We will have convectional currents from hot air rising from the surface. So, we are likely to see a lot of vertically circular patterns. Most likely the air will rise around the pillars (since they will pick up heat from the crust and radiate it) and fall in the centers away from the pillars. Also, they have to let enough of the right kinds of light through or plants die. Then herbivores die, carnivores die, we die, and the shrimp around the undersea vents become the inheritors of the planet. Now the question becomes, why the heck they would bother with such a construction unless they want to fly the finger at Earth through some massive, expensive and spiteful construction. The air pressure out there is such that it would need to be fully enclosed and pressurized unless they can operate in that low pressure. If they can survive that low of a pressure, they can build their city on the surface of Mars much more cheaply. Less expensive still would be to just build space habitats for their population. Those would involve a lot less engineering. From my pilot training, a pilot needs O2 at 12,000 feet if the aircraft is not pressurized to keep from falling asleep at the wheel. Pressurized airlines run at ~35,000 feet. 12 miles is 65,000 feet. 

The Pack/family is the most important. Anything that benefits the pack would be moral. Anything that is a detriment to the pack is immoral. Live for the pack, die for the pack. If you are valuable enough, you can provide children for the pack before you die. The strongest/smartest leader should lead the pack. Being sneaky is OK, if it supports the pack. Not sharing with the pack is a big no-no. Being packless is the ultimate punishment (maybe their equivalent to hell). 

I would be more concerned with the effect 0G has a lubricants. They get pretty squirrelly in 0G. They have a tendency to travel along surfaces and coat everything. So, the internal optics may get coated over. That happened to some of the first cameras sent into space. NASA has done a lot of research on effective lubricants for space. If the binocs are made for space, you are good. 

Yang is stronger at the equator of the sun and yin is stronger at the poles. this makes it hotter at the equator if the hollow earth and colder at the poles. This makes it similar to Earth. Yin is stronger at one pole of the sun and yang is stronger at the other. In this scenario, on pole would be cold and the other would be hot/desert and the center would graduate from one to the other but generally be mild. 

Eclipse, no. However, they could get a bunch of people outside at night by announcing a predicted visible supernova. They could even launch a satellite into LEO with the purpose of getting really bright for a short amount of time (enough time to draw people out of their homes). Note that this only works if it is OK that people realize after they are outside that it is a hoax. That's because a satellite will move across the sky differently than a star. However, by the time they see that, they will be outside. Also, even if it is seen as a hoax in the few minutes that it is happening, people will probably head outside to try to figure out what is going on. 

The one tech that might be allowed in your tight constraints would be advances in computers and radar so that the big gun's shells could be guided on the way down. If they could home in on ships, then you could fire over the horizon and still have a decent chance of getting a hit. 

Time will do it. There is continuous pressure from long lived corporations to extend the length of patents. The more power corporations have in your universe, the longer patents will end up. There is a reason why the length of patents were set as they are. The patent is designed to give the inventor/designer a short term monopoly so they can recoup the costs of R&D and make a profit. Then the new technology is suppose to go into the public domain so new entrants can price compete and get the product out to more people. The end of the patent is also there to allow the innovation to spread and inspire new ideas. So, if corporations are strong enough, they will push longer patents in order to give themselves longer monopoly periods. 

Also note that I mentioned that there are limitation on stealth; not that it was impossible. The more efficient your systems are ad doing what they need to do, the less heat you will radiate. Also, you can concentrate some of the radiated heat away from your target (if you know where that target is). Also, ship stealth is helped by the fact that space is big and there is a lot in it. Detection capabilities (a combination of receivers and computing power) determine how bright relative to a distant star a ship has to appear to be spotted in a short time. That will determine how far away the ship will be before you spot it. Shape can help with the cross section but you have to give up storage volume to do that. You also have to decide between storage and launchers. Given the distances involved, you can likely put most of your launchers on one side of the ship or you can spin she ship. That is a factor of other world considerations.
