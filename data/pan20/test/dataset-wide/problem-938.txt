This is only a partial answer as it doesn't explain why the excess of O2 stayed but one thing you have to appreciate is the fact that aerobic respiration appeared almost half a billion years after photosynthesis, so we can't really say that photosynthesis and respiration have always balanced each other. Cyanobacteria (and with them photosynthesis) are believed to have appeared somewhen between 3 and 2.5Ga (e. g. Altermann & Kazmierczak 2003, Brocks et al. 2003) while Mitochondria (and with them aerobic respiration) are thought to have evolved somewhen between 2 and 1.5Ga (see e. g. Hedges et al. 2004). There was therefore at least half a billion year during which cyanobacteria were producing O2 with no one able to breathe it. 

Macrostrat is (or in fact will be) what you are looking for I think. This database is still in development and is apparently only available through the website as a beta so far. It only seems to cover the US, Australia and New Zealand to this date but you can search for specific formations. From your example, here is a screenshot of the result I had while looking for surface outcrops of halite: 

(Wikimedia Commons) Since the Gnomonic projection can show only a single hemisphere, the Equator and parallels in the Southern hemisphere can't appear at all -- they would be an infinite distance from the center point. The polar orientation of the projection even takes away complications resulting from the earth's not being a perfect sphere -- the radius formula changes a little, but the equal results from the same input remain.

(Source: Wikimedia commons) Minnesota has early Archaen ("Superior" craton) rocks and a whole succession of Paleozoic. It has some Cretaceous rocks but lacks other Mesozoic/Cenozoic bedrock. North Dakota has some Jurassic age rocks in its northeastern corner. 

You don't say which lake, but these are almost certainly crinoid stem fossils. Crinoids, or sea lilies, are echinoderms (relatives of starfish and sea urchins) that anchor themselves to the sea floor and feed on plankton. In some crinoids, the animal's sea urchin-like calyx is connected to the anchor by a long stem to a holdfast which anchors it. The stem part of the crinoid's endoskeleton is a stack of calcareous rings or pentagons (called "ossicles") which look almost like a little spinal column. (However, vertebrates are not descended from crinoids, even though Echinoderms are deuterostomes, placing them closer to chordates than arthropods or molluscs). When the animal dies, it falls into the bottom sediment and the stem can become disconnected as the sediment is compressed into limestone. Sometimes the rings stay aligned, and show assemblages like you see in your rock. Other times, all you see are disconnected rings or little pentagons, like the ones all over the rest of the rock. Crinoids have been around since the Ordovician period 485 million years ago, so they appear in (and sometimes entirely make up) limestones throughout the world. 

From reading the literature on the subject, my impression is that we don't know that much on the subject, primarily due to a scarcity of measurements. My understanding is that the first and only year-long time-series was made at the Drake Passage in 1979 (e. g. Whitworth & Peterson, 1985) by the ISOS programme (International Southern Ocean Studies). In addition to that NOAA's WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) added yearly data from 1990 to 2002. According to Rintoul & Sokolov 2001 and Rintoul et al. 2001, most of the variability south of Tasmania is due to changes in currents north of the ACC itself. Cunningham et al. 2003 show that the moderate interannual variation in baroclinic transport they observed seem to be coeval with variations in the location of the Polar Front (it moves north or south on a 90km range). But overall the variability seems to be relatively low, and the ACC relatively steady. White & Peterson, 1996 showed an interesting phenomenon that they called the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave: it is a "wave" in the ACC circling the globe in ca. 8 yrs with a period of 4yrs at any location and it is defined by anomalies in sea-suface temperature, sea-level pressure and sea-ice extent. However no evidence for corresponding anomalies in volume transport was showed, to my knowledge. So, to summarize, as far as I can see: 

The short answer is, bauxite requires a particular alumina-rich source rock and a specific set of conditions and processes to concentrate the aluminum in a specific order. From the Encyclopedia of Arkansas: 

Circles! Well, some of them, anyway. You can plot any azimuthal projection in polar coordinates, where the radius is a function of the angular distance from the center point. So where two points' angular distances are the same, their radii are the same, and the projection of any locus of constant angular distance from the center point is a circle, if it appears at all. Since you said that the tangent point is a pole, that means that parallels (lines of constant latitude) are those lines of constant angular distance. Ergo, Northern Hemisphere parallels appear as circles. 

The rocks that make up Britain have been slowly drifting north over geologic time. About 700 million years ago it was near the South Pole! I paused this Youtube video at 75 mya, held the end of a toothpick over Cornwall, then played it to the end keeping the toothpick steady over that point, under which the approximate location of Bilbao, Spain eventually slid itself. Bilbao is at 43°15′25″N according to Wikipedia. So now, think of how longitude is defined: Relative to the meridian through Greenwich. A cursory glance at the video I linked to shows the rocks that make up Great Britain have moved as a unit and haven't rotated appreciably over the last 75 million years. So the longitudes associated with Cornwall haven't changed much in that time. 

Some may without basis, dislike this answer, but I believe you will find that the overall pattern of continents coming together, and drifting apart is in direct response to the orbit of the sun around the milky way. The periodicity matches and there are other tell-tales that add strength to the belief. I havent heard or found a better explanation for the period of this occurrence. And one side of the world, seems almost entirely void of continents, adding weight to something one-sided "attracting" the continents. Gravity is a wave pattern. There are those that are looking for it's shape. But one thing for sure, it has an "interference pattern". Please follow this link, and then set the smoothing radius to 25km, and map type "monthly anomalies, then browse, from 2002 through 2014. If you have experience with wave tables and interference patterns, you will see that there is an interference pattern, which tells you gravity is both coming and going. Then especially make note of the pattern greenland has in an 11 year cycle... sample 2002, 2007, 2013. It is obviously "bouncing" as it's pattern and the incoming pattern are running "lateral" to one another. This happens due to the reversal of the magnetic field of the sun. The link to the GRACE mission results are here: NASA - GRACE Mission Data Analysis Portal Hosted at Colorado U. AS a proposed "shape of gravity" I would have you consider this picture. It is gravity in a neutral "temperment".: 

The first thing to note here is that the zircons you mention in your question are the only thing we have dating from the Hadean: no known Hadean continental or oceanic crust have been found to date. So, all informations come from these zircons. What do they tell us? The rare earth element (REE) composition of these zircons (and in particular the zoning of said REE inside the mineral) suggests that they formed in a magma derived from the melting of a continental crust (Wilde et al. 2001). Their high $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ composition also indicates that the magma was at some point in contact with liquid water (also Wilde et al. 2001): both continents and oceans were present in the Hadean. The presence of liquid water already implies cooler temperature than what was previously thought (Valley et al. 2002). With regards to climate per say, the Lithium composition (high concentration, light isotopes) of the zircons (Ushikobo et al. 2008) have been interpreted as evidence of an intense chemical continental weathering. This weathering could have several explanations but one possibility retained by Ushikobo et al. 2008 (see also Sleep 2010) is a CO2-rich atmosphere with surface temperatures above 50°C. 

From an Earth Science standpoint, it's meaningless to ask about the "source" of a river in this way. The "source" of a river is the rainfall within its drainage basin, which percolates down into groundwater, and the "river" appears where the land has eroded down below the water table. The Amazon has an enormous drainage basin: 

(Source, Arkansas Geological Survey; a very detailed map can be downloaded here) The source rock (nepheline syenite) for the bauxite appears as two isolated blue spots in the middle of the map above, surrounded by (orange) Tertiary sedimentary deposits. The town of Bauxite is just to the northwest of the southern spot. Rather than cut and paste EOA's description of the process, I decided on the following summary: 

Source: USGS (via usu.edu) But BUT BUT it seems you want to know what happens to existing mountains. Some others have answered that only erosion destroys mountains, and that's mostly right, but only because it's a matter of timing. It's often difficult for us humans to comprehend just how big geological time scales are. Most of the time, a mountain range created by a continental collision is eroded away completely by the time the next rift comes along. This was the case along the eastern seaboard of the United States. The mountains created by the collosion of Africa and North America in the Carboniferous (the Alleghenian Orogeny) were almost completely gone by the Triassic, when the Atlantic Ocean began to form from a rift along about the same line. However, we have an example that might result in a qualified "yes" to your question, a little closer to the present. This is the way the Yellowstone Hotspot moved across what would become the northwestern United States. One of the things that caused geologists to recognize the Yellowstone Caldera was the 80km gap it melted in a mountain range it passed under, separating the Gallatin Range in the north from the Red Range in the south. The hotspot's track might just be the genesis of a new rift that breaks North America apart, given enough time and the right stresses.

To complement @MarkRovetta answer, McLoughlin & Grosch reported this year during EGU findings of carbonaceous fragments that they think are biogenic in the 3.4 Ga Buck Reef Chert. Chemical tests are still ongoing however. Schopf (2006) in his review of archean life reported a dozen of fossils in the 3 to 3.5Ga range. They are all "putative" fossil, however the biogenicity of the fossils he reports from the 2 to 3Ga range are frankly unquestionable. 

As a preamble, let me say that I don't know remotely enough on galactic dynamic to know if a supernova could have possibly been close enough during the Ordovician for Earth to be affected by a gamma ray burst, nor do I know enough about geochemistry to know if there are ways to detect such an event in the fossil record. That being said, the questions that I'll try to answer are: do we need to invoke an extraterrestrial event to explain the Late Ordovician glaciation? does the taxa selectivity of the extinction event support the GRB hypothesis? So let's look at the different hypotheses on how the glaciation occurred, the original conundrum being: how could a glaciation occur when mid-Ordovician $p_{CO_2}$ is believed to be up to 14 times Quaternary level? Brenchley et al. 1994 suggested that the Ordovician ocean circulation changed from a system having warm saline bottom waters to a system with cold bottom waters (i. e. a thermohaline instead of an haline circulation), which triggered a phytoplanktonic bloom, which then decreased atmospheric $p_{CO_2}$ and provoked an eutrophization of the ocean. Kump et al. 1999 argued in favor of a tectonically derived $p_{CO_2}$ decline: with the Appalachian and Caledonides orogenesis came an increased weathering which decreased $p_{CO_2}$. Of course the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive since increased weathering also means increasing nutrients in seawater and therefore increasing primary productivity. Another question is which groups went extinct during the glaciation: recent studies show that acritarchs (the most diverse group of phytoplankton known for that period) did not suffer from these events (Vecoli 2008); oppositely benthic group such as crinoids or brachiopods did (see Sheehan 2001 for a review); some pelagics groups such as graptolites and nautiloids did suffer as well during the event while some other didn't (radiolarians for instance). In summary there is no clear pattern, but there is also no reason to think that there was a preferential extinction of surface organisms over deeper-living ones. So, does that answer the question: no; but it seems to me that GRB doesn't explain better the event that unfolded during the late Ordovician than other hypotheses (namely the ocean eutrophization and the continental weathering). Does it discard the hypothesis of a GRB: no; but since there is no direct evidence that it indeed happened at that time, and that we can explain the Ordovician events without, it seems, to me, more parsimonious to think that it didn't.

So with our very OBVIOUS failure to understand physics, 95% of it being a dark mystery, and waffling over the number of fundamental forces, whether the origin of the universe was a big bang, how many dimensions there are, etc....HOW is it, we can ask ourselves questions like, is daily weather indicative of climate change, when we should be asking, is it viable to believe we have mastered knowledge of the physics of our existence, to the point necessary to be sure that climate change exists. We cannot. 

Without an understanding of the nature of the balancing act that lies in the middle between tiny and huge, believing we understand energy retention, energy dissipation, and the triggers involved to the point that we can properly determine the way the planetary energy system works is ludicrous. Physics in it's current state of development does NOT support our belief in CO2 based global warming. With the researchers at CERN currently considering and looking for a FIFTH fundamental force, HOW can we believe we know how our planet actually works.CERN Looking for FIFTH fundamental Force 

Quite the opposite. Divergent boundaries can cause mountain (well, actually volcano) building, because upwelling magma is part of the rifting process. First and most importantly, the Mid-Ocean Ridge can be considered the longest, most massive mountain range in the world. It's more obvious, of course, on continental rifts like the East African Rift. Mt. Kilimanjaro, a product of rift volcanism, is the highest mountain in Africa. Another famous locale of volcanism at a divergent boundary is Iceland, although a hot spot may play a role there. 

The 5 factors you mention are not nearly as important to the effect you're asking about as another, more fundamental factor: time. If you've read my answer to this other question, you should understand that all of the factors you mention would create temperature differences at different latitudes whether the Earth is tilted on its axis or not. But because the Earth's axis is tilted, at some parts of the year the regions of the Earth tilted towards the Sun (in "summer") receive sunlight a greater proportion of the day than the regions pointed away (in "winter"). Not only that, because of the more direct angle of the Sun the factors you list mean that the regions in "summer" are heated better during the day than the regions in "winter". And this adds up over all the days of summer or winter until the Earth's orbit reorients the axis relative to the Sun. Or even more succinctly, summer is hotter because the Sun is higher in the sky for more of the day. 

And when it comes to choosing the mathematical model that best fits our observations, we are still waffling between String Theory 11D, String Theory 12D. And we are attempting to determine if said strings even exist?!?! Discussion of the number of dimensions that exist 

Edited answer... Individual days weather variations can only be considered anomalies, since the theory of global climate change/global warming/anthropogenic CO2 related greenhouse effect acceleration only is theorized and described as affecting the planet over the course of decades and/or centuries and globally, not individual days or individual locations. With that said The weather variations in history have been far greater than any that have occurred during man's brief history of recording the weather, and far greater than any that have occurred during mans use of fossil fuels: 

Answer: Weather is weather. Climate change is a "theory", not a "premise". Therefor with the question depends on the factual existence of climate change, which I believe is incorrect since the foundation knowledge doesn't support the extrapolation of measurement and observation to the extent some people have taken it. Please consider that between quantum theory and the standard model, there is a reconciliation that has not been found. The balance point between that which is miniscule, and that which is massive has NOT been found. Our knowledge of physics is incomplete. Example: Quantum theory vs Standard model (which dictates an origin where the entire universe existed momentarily in a singluarity smaller than a grain of sand that then expanded to create the universe)... No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginning So where we have observed and believe we understand what we perceive as "matter", we actually only understand the nature of 5% of what exists. The remainder, dark matter and dark energy fill the void between electrons and nuclei. Similarly between stars and planets.
