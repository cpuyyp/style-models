They found a better candidate. You might be outstanding, but they found someone a bit more outstanding. You might be a good fit, but they found someone who they feel is a better fit. It happens. Don't take it personally. Keep looking - if this company liked you this much then certainly another company will as well. 

You can only base your opinion on what you can see, hear, and read. If you are only able to form your opinion based on what you heard in response to a pre-determined set of questions, you could judge them based on the technical thoroughness of their responses, the technical jargon they use (do they use it in the right context with the right meanings), etc. If at the end of the interviews you haven't gotten enough information, then hopefully the rubric allows you to answer "Not Applicable" as much as necessary. On the other hand, if you can read what this candidate has written outside of the interview process (blog, technical papers, Q&A forums, etc) you might be able to give a much better assessment. 

You can try being open and honest. You can say that you have an illness and a substance abuse issue but are actively being treated and now believe the issues are under control. Saying "The medications I am on is keeping me well-balanced and I am confident I can be an even better employee." sounds like a terrific approach. But don't say it unless you mean it, and unless your healthcare professionals will back you up. Some potential employers won't even ask about your current employment status. Some will, and I suspect most banks will. I also suspect lying or evading such questions for banking positions will come back to bite you. 

Assuming you are in the US, the answer right now is "Yes - that is indeed allowed". That said, it doesn't happen very often. Most employers give out only start date, end date, and title. Potential employers ask for your previous salary to see if you could fit into their salary structure, determine if you are being honest with them, and to help provide a framework for their offer. Note that you can always decline to provide your previous salary. If you take that route, many potential employers will not offer you the job. Note: Massachusetts has recently passed a law that will make it illegal to ask your current or previous salaries, unless that information is voluntarily provided. This law is scheduled to go into effect in January of 2018. At that point a Massachusetts interviewer (or an interviewer for a Massachusetts company, I believe) cannot ask such salary questions. The law will be enforced by the Attorney General. And an interviewee who has been asked such questions after that point may sue the company directly. After January 2018 in Massachusetts, you can decline to provide your previous salary, and know that legally that choice cannot be held against you when making the hiring decision. 

The fact that you used the word "work" here tells me that you know the answer. If your company policy clearly says that you shouldn't be involved in any business or any other job, it seems almost certain that this "work" violates this policy. You need to decide if violating your company policy is worth it to you and your spouse. In some companies, the policy isn't strongly enforced and doesn't much matter. In other companies, violating policy can get you terminated. Only you can determine which is the case here. Perhaps talking with your coworkers will help you figure that out? Be aware that the importance of a particular policy can change over time. Even if you determine it isn't important now, that may change later. 

There's no further reply necessary. You do want to find out the company's plan for your notice period, an exit interview (if required), and your final turnover day. That's probably a discussion with your boss, rather than with HR. 

You can always decline a background check in a polite way ("I politely decline to give my permission for a background check"). Folks still may become suspicious. Unfortunately, every company I know of that actually spends the time and money to perform background checks considers it mandatory, and would almost certainly drop you from consideration. 

This is okay, but you have to be ready to make your decision if they say something like "We are considering you as a candidate, but we cannot make our final decision in the next 2 weeks." I've been the hiring manager in situations like this. Sometimes the timing just isn't right and you have to decide between a real offer and one that may or may not actually happen. 

The only real answers to these questions come from within your company. If you worked for me, the answers might be different. And if you conducted a poll here (assuming that were actually permitted), you'll get a variety of answers. But none of those answers will make any difference - only your company and your management can tell you what they actually expect of you. You really should ask them, that's the only way you'll know the answers. We all need to find ways to conduct ourselves within the rules and customs of our company. I've worked at positions where I was expected to be available whenever my company needed me. And I've worked at other positions where time off was considered "sacred" and nobody would ever be expected to work when they had planned to be elsewhere. Asking someone outside of the company doesn't get you anywhere. 

Using an employer as a reference when intentionally omitting them from your CV is a risky proposition. Whenever I check references, I always ask the following questions (among others): 

Clearly, you should move on to a candidate who is interested. And you might also choose to make a notation in your database, indicating what happened with this particular candidate so that you don't waste your time in the future. I'm assuming you are new to your position. You will learn that this sort of thing happens all the time. Matching up candidates with position works both ways - the company must feel comfortable with the candidate, and the candidate must feel comfortable with the position. If this is a recurring theme, you may wish to review the way you describe the company and position to potential candidates. Perhaps you are missing something that would allow the candidate to make a clearer decision earlier in the process. 

Management has decided (for whatever reason) that this isn't an issue worth solving. Thus, there isn't likely much you can do about it directly. That said, your best course of action is likely to document and point out each instance where you are directly affected. If your computer is out of commission, and the IT Guy isn't able to get to it in a timely manner, then tell your boss about it. If you indicate that you are sitting on your hands due to IT often enough, it might get management attention. Make sure you let at least your boss know every time this happens, and how much productivity you lose each time. Perhaps, the next time budget planning occurs, the issue will be addressed. Perhaps not. 

If this person reports to you, then I assume you have regular one-on-one meetings. During your next meeting, you need to convey that this is unacceptable behavior, and that her attention is required in future meetings. You might choose to point out how this makes you feel, and how it adversely affects the meetings. Don't accept an "I was multitasking" excuse if you don't want her to do so. While there are plenty of articles and reports debunking the myth of multitasking (google "myth of multitasking" to find them), that's not really the issue here. How you want your direct reports to behave is the sole issue at hand. Every company, and every department has their own culture and expectations. If you are leading this group, then you get to decide how meetings involving your team should be attended. 

If you aren't overloaded, but you are working non-stop, then I'm not quite sure there is a real problem to be resolved here. At work, you are supposed to work, not have periods of time where you aren't working so that you can chill out. You seem to feel the same based on your characterization of your coworker. Still, if you feel you must "resolve this", you should talk with your boss. But when you do, don't focus on your coworker. Instead, focus on yourself. Point out what your non-stop work prevents you from doing that you feel you should be entitled to do. Point out what training you could take, what expanded duties you could take on, etc. You've already vented about the unfairness that you couldn't "tolerate" any longer, so your manager knows your feelings. Don't rehash those complaints - clearly they are a waste of time and will only make you come across as a whiner. If I had to make a bet, I'd bet that you will be rewarded more than your under-performing coworker. Perhaps you are paid more now, perhaps you'll get better annual reviews, perhaps you'll get more choice tasks and projects. Managers usually aren't stupid, they expect more of better workers, but they also reward them more often. But if after all of that you still cannot "tolerate" this unjust situation any longer, it might be time for you to consider seeking a different company. If you do, work hard to find a job and culture where everyone is treated exactly the same so that you are no longer "pricked out". In my experience, unequal work loads are the rule, rather than the exception. So look hard before you jump - you don't want to end up in another frustrating job, and have to go through this all again. 

Probably. It likely signals that you aren't a good fit for the position being filled. When I post a new position, my internal recruiters are given a salary range for that position, along with a job description, job requirements, etc. They attempt to find candidates who might fill that position, so that I can interview and hopefully hire them. In all the years I have been a hiring manager, I have never - not once - told recruiters to "find me the cheapest person possible". I'm not looking for a low-cost provider, I'm looking for an excellent employee. Excellent employees are worth good money. (Note: this does not apply to some contract positions, just for potential employees.) 

Maybe a nice certificate for their cubicle saying something like "I am a POWER USER, ask me anything!" or such would do the trick? Mention them prominently in the company newsletter. Give them a preferred parking spot, or some other small perk. If the budget permits, give them a hat or t-shirt. It probably depends on the culture of helping in your company. Here at stackexchange for example, folks are encouraged to help others and aren't paid for their efforts. This site uses gamification (voting, points, badges, ranking) as a way to help induce people to contribute. You could look into doing the same at very little cost. Award points for the best tips, or the most help. Have folks that have been helped by these power users vote for the "Power User of the Month". Award badges. Etc. Often emphasizing the "helping" aspects of the role brings out the best in the helpers. And publicly recognizing their efforts can give them a sense of satisfaction. Do that well, and others will want to be part of the helping culture. 

In most states you would be disqualified from receiving Unemployment Benefits if you quit without good cause attributable to your employment. Your situation may or may not be considered "good cause". Look at your state's Unemployment Benefits website to see what the specific laws of your state say. If you are in New York, see: $URL$ In most locales, you need to be actively seeking work to be eligible for benefits. I always recommend that you find your next job before you quit your current job, but sometimes conditions are intolerable. Make sure you look for work now. If you are eligible for benefits, you will likely have to prove that you are looking. In my state, you have to periodically provide evidence. Nobody here can adjudicate this for you - it would only be guessing. The case will depend on your state laws, and what you and your former employer say to the Unemployment board. You'll need to wait a few weeks to see if your claim is denied. If it is, you'll have an appeal process. 

You can feel however you choose to feel. But you have not actually been aggrieved. You resigned. The company can choose to describe the position any way it chooses. It can re-define the role as more senior. It can increase the responsibilities or reduce the responsibilities. It can increase the pay significantly, or reduce the pay. It is not "a senior post for me now", since you don't have a post - you resigned. Recruiting an additional junior person is not an admission of anything. As often happens, when someone leaves, the company is just deciding to do things differently. 

I would interpret it as the fact that the hiring manager doesn't see many resumes from applicants that have your type of mostly-technical (perhaps even pretty much solely-technical?) background. And apparently your profile isn't quite what they are looking for in an Auditor. Audit (even within IT) is far more about governance, procedures, processes, surveys, controls, best-practices, and compliance than about the more technical aspects of IT. In future revisions, you may wish to tone down the technical aspects in favor of your background creating and following written processes. Since you are attempting to change careers, you might wish to talk with someone who is already an Auditor. She/he could give you feedback as you edit your resume into a more Auditor-like form.
