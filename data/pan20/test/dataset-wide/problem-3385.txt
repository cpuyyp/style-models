What can be difficult is highly personal and mother-tongue-dependent, so let me mention just two features of Chinese that seem hard to master, as for me. 

The title means "A wake in the house of the deceased", beer here means 'to bear, to support', and it's most probably the latter meaning which is relevant here. 

The English sibling is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *s(w)e-bh(o), an enlargement of the root *swe- "self" and is related to the second element in the English word gossip. Slavic languages have words which are also derived from the PIE *s(w)e-bh(o), for example, Russian has the root seb- ("себ-") also meaning "self" (для себя - 'dlya sebya' - "for oneself"). There is also an adjective sobstvenny ("собственный") - '(one's) own' formed from another variant of the root, *sob-. 

Also note, since 'there' in 'there is / there are' has no lexical meaning of is own, if you do want to use the real adverb 'there' as an adverbial modifier of place, you'll have to use it for the second time in the sentence: 

This ligature stands for quae. Here is a modern type transliteration of that sentence with the ligature, it is below the image of the page: 

The language is Kazakh. It's a fragment of a poem by Шал (Тілеуке) Құлекеұлы aka Шал ақын (1748 – 1819): 

First, is not used in Latin as a separate word, the Latin for "two" is . Next, I cannot see why that sentence surprises you. It really means "twice pairwise", "twice in pair", but isn't that the same as "two pairs", ? is plural of the word (pair), so the verb is plural. I would translate the Latin sentence as "Two pairs make four." 

Since numeral symbols are ideograms, even English has such sequences, for example '666' is often pronounced as 'six-six-six'. 

I'm afraid no, almost any sequence of words can be a correct sentence in English in a particular context, e.g. sentences like "Buffalo buffalo buffalo...". Your first example is correct, if it is an imperative sentence which means "Make your yellow color more lemon," a painter can say that to his apprentice. Your third example is correct, if it is a newspaper headline which allows the absence of articles, and 'Jim' is plural, for example it is the abbreviated name of an organization. Not to speak about different local or social varieties of English. On the other hand, it can well be done for the EASL class use for the most standard meanings of such sentences where the grammar is prescriptive. Still, there's too much variety even here, and not only grammar, but also some semantic and context analysis is needed, and that makes it much harder. 

These data are usually used to support or weaken the argument in favour of a particular model. In the case of the models discussed, they are designed to address predictions stemming from assumptions about the stages of speech production, and the order (if any) in which these stages are processed. For instance, WEAVER++ assumes that syntactic and semantic information is accessed prior to phonological information. Thus the TOT effect occurs when phonological information is difficult to access. Harely and Bown (1998), showed that words with an unusual phonological form are more susceptible to TOT, evidence that supports WEAVER++. As an aside, the 'priming' studies that Nathan refers to are in fact uses of the masked prime paradigm with a lexical decision task. These are used to investigate the processes involved in visual word recognition (i.e. reading), and are a great way to investigate the information we can access very quickly from written language. For instance, that we compute phonological information from brief (50ms) presentations of non-words (Kinoshita & Norris, 2012). What such information tells us about the mental lexicon is unclear. This isn't meant to be an exhaustive account of speech production. I've undoubtably presented some contentious information, and excluded some important information. Regardless, hopefully I've given you enough resources to make a start on your own research. Most of the articles I've mentioned are accessible through google, at the very least, Dell (1986) and Levelt et al (1999) definitely are. *Don't be put off by the length of Levelt et al (1999). Behavioural and Brain Sciences articles often include commentary by researchers in the same field, so the article itself is only about 35 pages long. The commentary is a great way to a get a feel for how a theory fits in with the rest of the field. Personally, I think it's a great idea. Dell, G. S. (1986). A spreading-activation theory of retrieval in sentence production. Psychological Review, 93(3), 283-321. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.3.283 Harley, T. A. & Bown, H. E. (1998).

"John" is the antecedent. As far as I know, it is pronouns that have antecedents, and "himself" is a pronoun, not "John". "Antecedent" is often used as the general term for both antecedents proper (the preceding ones) and for postcedents (the following ones), so the answer is anyway "John", but whether is is the antecedent or the postcedent depends on the terminology you use. I would call it "antecedent" irrespective to its position before or after the pronoun. 

Nothing special happens, only that sound is a vowel, it makes a syllable. Like the Czech which means 'death', the syllable starts with [sm], then goes the vowel [r̥], then goes [t], a syllable of the type CCVC is formed. There's nothing special in the pronunciation of the [r̥], besides the fact it makes a syllable. 

This is a surname which is widespread in Eastern Europe, mainly in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. This word comes from Ukrainian and it is an adjective which means "barefoot, without shoes". In Ukrainian it is spelled Босий ['bɔsɪj], in Russian the surname is spelled Босый ['bɔsɨj] (the Russian word for "barefoot" is босой [bə'sɔj]), and in Belarusian it is Босы ['bɔsɨ]. The surname spread all over the former USSR, and since many Jews have this surname, it can be found all over the world, too. Interesting to note that the adjective босий "barefoot" is actually an etymological cognate of the English adjective "bare" whose original meaning was "naked, uncovered, unclothed." 

This is really an extremely interesting question that made me make a little investigation and with the help of @fdb I learned about the unique Siyaq (Arabic سياق siyāq ‘order’) numerical system I had never heard of before. The system was originally developed by Arabs and later was used in official Ottoman and Indian documents: 

Still, as you can see, this affects some specific groups of words, in native Russian words nobody mixes up the two letters. Also, your question is connected with hypercorrection, like H-adding etc., that happens in many languages. 

I'm currently reading Jackendoff's Foundations of language and I've realised that my knowledge of syntax, morphology and phonology isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. I'm coming from a psych background, and I'm quite comfortable reading psycholinguistics texts. However, (and this is a point that Jackendoff makes) I've realised that the psycholinguistics I've come into contact with thus far seems to downplay the complexity of language. As someone who would like to pursue a career in the cognitive sciences and who has an interest in language, I'd like to address this gap in my knowledge. So my question for you is this: What are some good resources for those of us who are curious about language, and can comfortably tackle some of the more basic literature, but who don't have the same level of knowledge that a linguistics graduate would have? Thanks in advance. 

A caveat: I'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine. This answer may not be as clear as I'd like. The nature of the cognitive structures that make up linguistic knowledge is still a very open question. In fact, the nature of cognitive structures in general is still hotly contested (and rightly so). Before I answer your questions, I think a little clarification is in order. Models of mental processes (at least from my perspective) are not likely to be accurate representations of the actual, real world functioning of the brain. Like any scientific theory, they're only as good as the predictions they make. So just because a model has support does not mean that it captures the nature of cognitive structures. Rather, it means that it accurately predicts behaviour. What I'm getting at is that different processes can produce the same behaviour, and just because a model makes accurate predictions, does not mean that it necessarily is an accurate model of the cognitive processes involved. With regards to your first question. It's important to consider what type of language phenomena you're interested in. Different models attempt to capture the functioning of different processes, and each model has its own set of assumptions about the associated mental functions. Judging by the task you set yourself (which, by the way, is referred to as a verbal fluency test), you're interested in speech production, so we'll look at that. There's two influential theories of speech production, Dell's (1986) spreading activation model and Levelt et al's (1999) WEAVER++ model*. This article, by Levelt, is a great primer on the different types of speech production models. Both models assume that lexical knowledge is instantiated in a network, but make different assumptions about how processing proceeds through the network, and the different steps involved. I won't spend any time describing them since the Levelt article does a much better job of that. Returning to my first point, this isn't to say that these models are accurate descriptions of the mental lexicon. Rather, they're influential models that do a good job of predicting linguistic behaviour. On to your second question... At a the level of experimental design, psycholinguistics experiments differ from what you describe in that they usually:
