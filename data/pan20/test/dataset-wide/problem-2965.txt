Voltaire advocated deism and vehemently opposed atheism. As far as I know, one of the most important reasons he gave was pragmatic, that the uneducated lower class must be kept believing in god, otherwise ethics and social order would collapse. Hence his famous quote that if god would not exist, we would have to invent him. I am confused if he meant that the lower classes should be taught deism instead of traditional Christianity, or if deism would have be kept hidden from them. In the latter case, his pragmatic argument for deism would be pointless. But otherwise, could one really assume that teaching deism is an important contribution to teaching ethical behaviour? The usual argument is that belief in god contributes to ethics since believers expect that god will punish evildoers after death. Traditional Christianity claims to know very precise rules how that judgement will happen. So let's imagine that a deistic teacher describes a god who created the universe like a clockmaker and does not interfere after that. The teacher could still claim that this god also punishes evil in the next life. But what if a pupil ask how exactly we know that? Is a clockworker god allowed to send revelations? If the teacher argues that we can conclude god's judgement of good and evil according to the rational structure of the universe, the pupil could point out that even then we cannot know if the deistic god's punishment will be harsh or benevolent; that kind of god might be extremely forgiving and quickly resocialise all sinners into heaven. So I would conclude that deism can hardly be expected to provide much deterrence. Has Voltaire ever discussed questions like that? I guess one could view the matter more in the light of a historic political process, that effectively deism in that era hoped to masquerade as a mild and moderate form of Christianity, and the Christian establishment to a certain extent went along with that, offering some sort of tacit deal like "if you deists attack atheism just as vehemently as we do, we will give you a seat in the supervisory board as the token sceptic". But that would mean Voltaire's reasons were purely political. My question is, did he (or for that matter, other deists discussing the same topic) give solid philosophical reasons for preferring deism to atheism in regard to ethics? 

Wheaton's wikipedia page calls his role "a fictionalized version of himself". That takes care of the problem, I'd say - the differences between the fictionalized version and the real one are pretty obvious, so there's no need to call him a "fictionalized version" in the credits.

I'd like to point out something that seems to get easily lost in this context: Before one asks "Does science reject the concept of god" one should first consider the related (and much more important, in my opinion) question: "Does science reject the concept of a god who interferes in his creation?" The god of deism (that means a "watchmaker"-god who created the universe and set it in motion but after that keeps his hands off it) might be compatible with science, but a god who answers prayers, performs miracles, sends visions and so on? Hardly. If you disagree, consider the following thought experiment: You are a scientifically thinking person who happens to be in Jerusalem around the year 30 A.D. Someone comes running to you and shouts "Hey, remember that Jesus guy who was crucified three days ago? He just came back from the dead!" What do you do? Fall on your knees and pray? Or do you point out: "Unless I receive compelling evidence to the contrary, to me it seems rather more likely that it was only apparent death, or that his death was faked." With that in mind, the gap between theism (in this case, christianity) and deism seems much wider and much more noteworthy than the one between deism and atheism. (And agnosticism, for that matter.) Probably that's because organised christianity, like most or even all religions I guess, is almost impossible to separate from the belief that its religious rituals (including prayer) have actual power and its religious taboos are actually dangerous. (If you are not sure what I mean by "religious taboos", try to remember if you felt uneasy reading the expression "that Jesus guy" a few lines earlier. Not because I was being impolite to christian readers, but because god might actually punish me for dissing his son.) An interesting aside here is that I have the impression that although deism and agnosticism should in theory reject the idea of religious rituals and taboos having actual power, they do not like to emphasize that. I'm getting a bit into speculation here of course, but it seems to me that often only atheism is seen as actively taking a stand against organised religion, whereas deists and agnostics are perceived as saying "please, we don't want to cause any trouble, just leave us alone" - i.e. they are just fence sitters to unimportant to bother with. To get back to the original question, you ask whether agnosticism might be a more scientific approach than atheism. While I guess technically I agree, I suspect that agnosticism is misunderstood by too many people to mean something like "there's a fifty-fifty chance that god exists". It's important to remember that miracles, answered prayers and religious rituals are not just from the atheistic, also from the agnostic point of view not much more than superstition. That may seem a bit unrelated to the actual question, but I suspect it's the elephant in the room. EDITED to reply to the following comment by gerdi: "The OP was actually more to do with scientific method in the viewpoint of atheism as taken by some very outspoken scientists. Not deism. I want to understand what science is used in their ideology, to get to the point where they push their ideas like that of their zealous religist opponents." Fair point. But you seem to imply that if atheists like Dawkins are militant, agnostics are not. In the sense that atheists insist that god does not exist, while agnostics do not insist, that may seem a fitting description. What I wanted to point out is the following: Aside from the question if god exists, I'm pretty sure those atheists also "militantly" criticise the belief in miracles and similar interfering actions of a theistic god. And I think in that "battlefield" a scientifically motivated agnostic would have no choice but to take a stand against religion, too. If I understand Neil Meyer's answer correctly, he claims that there are lots of scientists who are also happily religious. That's probably true in so far that those persons either avoid to confront the problem, or mean something rather different with "religious" than most people (i.e. deism). I cannot see how one can take the scientific method seriously and still accept a theistic concept of god. So a confrontation here is pretty much unavoidable (unless you choose to avoid the topic to stay out of trouble). And if you have become militant in that arena, you might chose to go all the way and call yourself an atheist, to avoid misunderstandings and to send a message that you are not afraid of controversy. That's at least why I would call myself an atheist rather an agnostic. 

As far as I know, Anselm's argument for the existence of god goes like this: Let's imagine the most perfect being possible. If we imagine it being most perfect but not existing, it would be even more perfect if it existed, which causes a contradiction. So imagening the most perfect being makes it logically impossible to assume it does not exist. Let's ignore the often discussed locical problems of this reasoning, and focus instead on the possibility that the same argument could be recycled for a god that is not perfect but perfectly evil. The argument would then be: I imagine the most evil god I can think of. If you define evil as the ability and inclination to cause harm and suffering, that ability would be obviously greater for an existing than for an non-existing god. Therefore imagening the most evil god would logically force me to assume he exists. (If you wish, you could replace "evil" with similar attributes like destructive, threatening, scary, cruel, harm-causing, all-hating etc.) The conclusion obviously is in contradiction with Anselm's. One could even claim it is in contradiction with itself, since the most destructive or cruel god would already have destroyed the universe, or made our past life full of torture. (Even if some persons might be justified in claiming their lives could not have been more unhappy, I suppose for at least some of us that is not true, which should be enough to exclude the "perfectly" cruel god. Or is he just biding his time?) A possible objection would be that "perfect" is somehow an intrinsic attribute, but "cruel" or "evil" are only human evaluations, and "destructive" makes only sense in relation to something else. But what about "all-loving" or "all-good", which are often claimed as intrinsic attributes of god (though not in this exact context)? My question is: Has an argument like this ever been suggested in philosophic literature, and are there arguments for/against it which I did not think of? Especially, is there a way to defend Anselm's argument but refute this one? 

I don't quite get what your suggestion about quantum physical states is supposed to mean. Maybe (I'm speculating) what you have in mind there is the concept that intelligent life is "good", and you're looking for a quasi-objective way to measure and compare the existence of intelligent life? Anyway, if I understand the algorithm you're after correctly, it needs first a definition of "good" by objective criteria, and then secondly a method to measure those objective criteria. I assume the definition of good is supposed to be reasonably close to the usual ethical values. To put it differently, it should more or less agree with the intuitive judgement that suffering and brutality are "not good". Does that mean we need an objective method to define and gauge suffering? For physical suffering that might be doable, but what about emotional suffering? That gets very complicated due to different personalities and different cultural values. (For example, if a vengeful person posted naked pictures of his ex-lover on the internet, some of the victims might just shrug it off, others would feel deeply humiliated and shamed. In an extremely prudish cultural environment, the victim might even be driven to suicide.) Nevertheless, we might get a reasonably close approximation to those intuitive ethical frame conditions if we assume that emotional suffering would be in most cases a consequence of injustice, and injustice could be measured objectively by things like distribution of wealth and occurence of physical violence. I guess along lines like that an algorithm could be constructed. But it would only apply to humans. You want an algorithm that applies to all intelligent entities. However, a non-human intelligence could have totally different values and ethics. For example, in a science fiction story Stanley Weinbaum imagined an intelligent plant that has neither the ability nor the wish to influence its environment; it even honestly does not mind at all if it's killed and eaten. With that in mind, I consider it unlikely that a satisfying "one size fits all" algorithm could be found. Of course, relativistic worries about emotional suffering could be ignored and some objective values dictated, like "the more intelligent entities exits, the better. And the more they are allowed to act intelligently and creatively, i.e. create ordered but unpredictable things, the better." With an algorithm like that, there remains your condition (c) to satisfy. You don't want an "obviously" dystopian future. What is "obviously"? I assume that leads back to the assumption I already made, that the results of the algorithm should not be to different from "intuitive" ethics. But it also hints at the problem that if an unwise algorithm were in power and inadvertently constructed a dystopian future, one should be able to stop it with some sort of emergency break, i.e. return to intuitive ethics. That problem has some similarities with the classical question if the ends justify the means. I suppose a lot of people are uncomfortable with that concept because, like your algorithm, it might lead to conflicts with intuitive ethics that are hard to swallow (like large-scale political murders). With that in mind, it might seem safer to decide ethical problems on a case-by-case basis and accept that from time to time bad judgements happen and "retrials" should remain possible. 

The ontological argument of Descartes tries to show that a supremely perfect being (=god) must logically exist. Let's assume that this logic were valid. We would have proven that a "perfect" god existed, but would not be able to tell whether that god was the god of Christianity or Islam. Also not proven would be most of the central dogmas of Christianity, especially that god is a trinity. What happens when we add the attribute of being a trinity to the "proven" supremely perfect god? That attribute either enhances his perfection, which would be a contradiction; or it reduces his perfection, which would make the proof invalid; or it is irrelevant for his state of perfection. My gut feeling says that it makes no sense to argue that perfection and trinity can "co-exist" without affecting each other. So I'm curious, if in philosophical history any arguments were suggested in this context, either pro or contra?
