The authors of the BMJ article built a web site, Study329.org, that describes the process of obtaining access to the raw data, along with information about the original study, the original investigators, and press coverage of the BMJ article. The anonymized patient-level raw data they needed were not posted to the company's web site, and gaining access to the data and copying it over to the authors' computers, given the difficulties imposed by GSK, were among the largest challenges of the project. 

Suicidal adolescent test subjects on paroxetine in GSK's write-ups were described as emotionally labile, if their adverse events were even mentioned. This was explicitly stated in an email among several dozen that were leaked Emotional lability can mean nothing more than rapidly changing moods, none of which are depression or despair, and isn't interchangeable or closely linked with "suicidality" in mental health parlance. In the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, these related terms are offered as equivalent to emotional lability: 

This addresses the third question, which was about the recall of any drugs that had been misrepresented by company-sponsored research. Paroxetine has not been recalled, but calls for the retraction from the scientific record of its maker's clinical trials with adolescent subjects have yet to cease. The FDA warns of serious side effects including suicide that would not have occurred without the drug, but apparently doesn't believe that's enough of a reason to recall it. Just a note about the FDA and the premise of the question: The FDA does not limit approvals to drugs that are universally helpful and harmless, and they do not necessarily recall drugs that have killed people. They do require warnings of adverse events when those are known, and highlight the most important ones by drawing a black box around them. They have yet to recall Serzone (nefazodone), which caused so many liver failures, transplants, and deaths that it can no longer be sold in Europe. Here, the manufacturer withdrew it voluntarily after the death of a 15-year-old girl followed 20 other deaths and dozens of liver failures, but the FDA doesn't object to the availability of generics; doctors can prescribe it and pharmacies can still sell it. GSK (formerly Glaxo Smith Kline) was found to have mis-reported results from their Phase III trials of the safety and effectiveness of paroxetine for adolescents. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) sold as Paxil in the US and Seroxat in the UK (and many other names around the world). The FDA relied on the reports and the drug was approved for the expanded market of adults and adolescents. Also, there was a heavy contribution of GSK-funded ghostwriters on the original study, which listed high-profile academic psychiatrists as its authors. Reports of unexpected suicides among adolescents on the drug began to surface. In 2002, the British series "Panorama" presented an investigative report called "The Secrets of Seroxat" that had a large impact on the British public. BBC received nearly 1400 emails and published all of them. The episode is currently viewable on youtube. In 2004, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued GSK for withholding negative information about the drug's effect on children. The company promised to post clinical trial data on their web site and paid $2.5M to the state. Last year the British Medical Journal published a multi-author study that presented a re-analysis of the trial data, and new findings about the drug's safety and effectiveness, in a purportedly unbiased manner. In sum: not especially effective, and more likely to induce suicidality than placebo or the comparison drug, an older, non-SSRI antidepressant. From the study: 

The women who were put into the laundries were made to work, and their work was profited from, in a way which would be illegal in "official" Irish prisons, where it would be deemed a human rights violation. The laundries were subject to the same inspections as regular workplaces. From Chapter 12 of the report: 

Chapter 20 of the Magdalen Final Report (more below) details the financials of some of the laundries. These demonstrate that the Laundries were being paid for work carried out by the women, for which no wages were given. Yes. They can be considered slaves. They also weren't allowed keep any children they had, which while not a distinct facet of slavery, gives an idea of the level of dehumanisation we're talking about. The Margaret Bullen article is one example. The incarceration and forced labour was in no way underground. About 25% of hostages were delivered to the laundries by the state. I refuse to call them inmates, as I don't consider any of them criminals, and most of them weren't criminals in law either. The Gardai colluded in returning escapees and delivering hostages. The courts were also comlplicit. For your verification, I'm referring largely to the Magdalen Final Report which was released in February 2013 by the Irish Government after an extensive study. I encourage you to check it, but it is over 1,200 pages long. From the report: 

Short answer, no there is no direct proof of negative effects. Long answer follows. Well, strictly speaking BGH or bovine growth hormone is definitely a bad thing, but not in the way that most people mean. Bovine growth hormone, known commercially as Posilac, increases the yield of dairy cows, but comes at the price of higher infection rates and pus content in milk. To combat the infections dairy farmers are forced to put more antibiotics into the cows to keep them healthy. Some of this filters in through the milk, which in turn can lead to resistant bacteria, which is a definite health concern for humans. However, the FDA has found no significant difference between rBGH and non-rBGH milk, Canada banned it's use for it's detrimental affects on animals, but also said that humans have no noticeable detrimental effects from rBGH milk. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ For beef cattle the issue remains the same the FDA has found no link to any sort of health issues related to using either natural or artificial hormones. One study found that women who ate beef with the growth hormone produced sons with lower sperm counts, however none of the men in the study were unable to conceive normally. The EU health concerns leading to their ban of any natural or synthetic hormones is related to the improper administration of the hormones in doses above the approved safety standards by EU member states and the US was not found to be in violation of any approved levels considered safe for human consumption. 

If taking someone prisoner indefinitely is considered taking ownership of them, this condition is met. This is somewhat subjective. The accompanying definition of the slave trade: 

Their imprisonment was also illegal for many years, though the church had the support of the Garda Siochana (Irish Police Force) who would both deliver hostages to them and return escapees. As for the date of 1996, by this stage, admissions to Magdalene laundries were no longer part of Irish life. On one hand, we had become more enlightened and liberated as a society. On the other hand, washing machines were cheaper to use. However, up to this date there were still older women who had been taken hostage years previous. They may have been somewhat institutionalised, or otherwise had nowhere else to go, but they were still being deprived of a number of their human rights. The laundries stopped working in 1996, but some of the women had become inmates, not knowing who to integrate into society. At this point, their prison was more mental than physical. As for the treatment of the women over the years, it was bad. They were de-humanised and subject to abuse and exploitation you wouldn't give an animal. We're talking about a combination of psychological, and often physical torture and hard labour. Some were literally worked to death. Some died later on from kidney and liver failure, as a direct result of sustained exposure to the laundry chemicals. One example is Margaret Bullen, who entered the laundries when she was 5, because her mother was unable to take care of her, and died when she was 51, still inside a convent, from Given that many entered into the laundries when they were children, it is relevant to consider the findings of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. This was an investigation into the living conditions of children in state care, almost always run by monks, priests, and nuns. It doesn't particularly apply to the Laundries, but it should give you some idea of what the church in Ireland were capable of. The Ryan Report, published in 2009, came to these conclusions, among others:
