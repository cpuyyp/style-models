Are there any studies that show that "Affirmative Action" (an action or policy favoring those who tend to suffer from discrimination, especially in relation to employment or education) hurts the economy? Based on personal research/reasoning, I believe that "Affirmative Action" could hurt the economy, but I would like to do more research on the subject. Any links to (credible) studies showing that "Affirmative Action" hurts the economy would be greatly appreciated. 

Is there a difference between the meanings of the terms "economies of scale" and "learning curve"? The term "learning curve" is being used by cost estimators and refers (more or less) to the idea that businesses will have a higher cost per item if they make relatively few products but will have a lower cost per item if they make more products. I thought this concept sounded similar to decreasing marginal cost within the economies of scale. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find information to prove that they mean the same thing. Can anyone confirm? 

Last year, I read the book The Bankers' New Clothes: What's Wrong with Banking and What to Do about It. The book explained some of the causes of the recent financial crisis of 2007-2009 and gave some steps to prevent a similar crisis from occurring again. Some of the steps were 

In this article, the author looks at some of the indirect effects caused by the rioting in Ferguson, Missouri after the jury's decision not to indict the police officer. He explains that the rioting has hurt the economy (both short-term and long-term) in Ferguson and other communities where rioting is taking place. Are there actual numbers that support this conclusion? Also, can this conclusion be expanded to say that rioting impairs the economy? 

First off, dollars are not the sole determination of wealth. People can be wealthy by having a large house and a nice car and still have \$0 in the bank. Dollars hold wealth only because they can be exchanged for goods or services that actually do have value. With that being said, let us take a look at what you have asked: 

However, economics in plagued by the law of unintended consequences. If these three points were implemented into the US financial system, what are some unintended consequences that could result? 

I read an article about the recent fall of gas prices in the US claiming that the fall in gas prices was due to the expansion of fracking within the US. The article said that, over the past few months, the oil harvested from fracking had come onto the market reducing the price of gas at road-vehicle refueling stations. Obviously, I realize that an increase of supply with a constant demand will decrease prices. But, is there any way to validate the article and conclude that the decrease in oil prices was due to fracking? The article I read did not go into detail on how they reached their conclusion. 

It is generally accepted among economists that minimum wage warps the equilibrium point between the supply and demand of labor by instituting a price floor and increases unemployment for unskilled laborers (while increasing the wage for the individuals who continue to work). However, I have noticed that politicians continue to advocate an increase in the minimum wage. Politics and political maneuvering aside, is there an economic reason as to why a higher minimum wage would benefit the economy? 

The two phrases that I have emphasized above, hold the answer to your question. In fact, you have almost answered your question in the first phrase. The only reason that wealth has concentrated in Person A (who creates a product that everyone else purchases) is because everyone else has determined that they would rather have that product than the money that they have. The benefits of having that product outweigh the benefits of keeping the money. Many economists would argue that everyone is better off because the seller has improved his life by getting more money and the buyers have improved their lives by getting the better product. Now, what does Person A do with the money? Person A does the exact same thing that everyone else did originally: he looks for products that he would rather have than money. In the marketplace, Person B, Person C, and Person D are all selling unique products of their own. Person A sees value in purchasing the products from Person B and Person D, but values his money more than the product from Person C. So, Person A purchases from Persons B and D but not from Person C. This means that the money flows from Person A to Person B and Person D. This cycle will continue to repeat indefinitely. As long as Persons A, B, and D continue to produce products that people value more than money, they will continue to gain wealth. On the flip side, as long as Person C does not produce a product that people value more than money, he will not gain wealth. 

Malthusians and Neo-Malthusians believe that, eventually, the population of the earth will be exceed the number of people able to be sustained by the earth's food production. As such, they advocated different forms of population control. However, it appears that an increase in the population beyond that of the food supply would cause an increase in the overall real price for food. Proponents of Malthusianism, evidently, are not waiting for food prices to rise before advocating population control, but I do not see how we should be worried until the real price of food increases. If Malthusianism is correct, how soon before the population crash would prices begin to rise? 

Most individuals refer to the former USSR as a "communist" nation, but, in reality, it was only a "socialist" nation with a high level of governmental control in all areas of its citizens' lives. Have there been any true "communist" nations as Marx envisioned? 

Answer: From the research that I have done in order to answer this question, I believe that the following premise is flawed: 

The Nash Equilibrium provided a new look at certain economic problems and won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994. Since it's creation, the Nash Equilibrium has been applied to "international relations" specifically for war and arms-race scenarios. But, has the Nash Equilibrium lead to any significant economic discoveries? I had heard rumors of the Nash Equilibrium being applied to bank-runs and other financial crises but nothing to back it up. 

The normal supply and demand models take the supply and demand of a particular good and show that the equilibrium price is where the two curves intersect. At this point, all the people below the equilibrium point value the good as worth less than the price; on the other hand, all the people above the equilibrium point value the good as worth more than the price; people at the equilibrium point value the good at the price value. In my mind, following this logic, everyone should want to "purchase" a free good. But that is not necessarily the case. For example, in an undergraduate program, the university will give away t-shirts, pens, etc. to the students for free. However, not all of the students will want these items. However, since the price is free, it seems that everyone should want them. How do we reconcile both of these observations? 

Since the fracking industry in the US has started to grow rapidly, I have heard increasing reports that OPEC is attempting some form of predatory dumping in the hopes of making the fracking industry in the US unprofitable. How successful do economists predict that OPEC's dumping strategy will be? For example, does OPEC have a large profit margin and the fracking industries a small profit margin (making fracking an unprofitable enterprise quite easily under some form of predatory dumping) or are the profit margins close enough to make any predatory dumping infeasible in the short-run? 

The laws of thermodynamics and futuristic technological advancement aside, I will attempt to answer the economics portion of the question. You are a farmer that needs to plant "the back forty" (acres). You could either (A) use a hoe and do the work by hand, or (B) use a tractor and do the work in a matter of hours. You would probably choose the tractor since it would save you weeks of labor that you could use to work another job or till more acres of land. You chose to use the machine because it reduced your labor. But what about the labor beyond your local farm? Any farmers around you who do not have a tractor will not be able to keep up with your productivity. The market disruption will force them to sell their farms and, more importantly, find work elsewhere. No one is going to pay them because you have a tractor or because technology has advanced beyond hoes. The other farmers are still going to need to work for their living. So, they go find work. Fortunately for them, the invention of tractors has caused a small increase demand for iron chassis, rubber wheels, petroleum, etc. and new jobs have been created. Some of the farmers get these jobs; the rest of the farmers get jobs in other sectors of the economy. These ex-farmers invent or help to invent other machines, and the cycle continues. Did the ex-farmers' transition from a "low-cost" zone to a "high-cost" zone? I would answer with "a qualified yes." The ex-farmers could no longer make a living as farmers. So they moved to a sector where they could make a living. However, I would also say that the invention of the tractor transitioned the farmer occupation from a "high-cost" zone to a "low-cost" zone, in the first place. Is it possible for the tractor to produce more "work" in total than goes into it? Yes. Since it is much harder to see this answer from the tractor example, I will used the simpler "machine" of the lever. You are using your tractor to plow some new land and find a 200lb stone in your field. You do not have rope to pull it with the tractor; instead, you use a sturdy tree branch to move the stone. Depending on how long your lever (tree branch) is and where you place your fulcrum, any amount of force less than 200lbs would move the stone. The equation for the lever is $F_1 * d_1 = F_2 * d_2$ where $F_1$ is the 200lb stone, $d_1$ is the distance of the stone to the fulcrum, $F_2$ is your force, and $d_2$ is the distance of your force to the fulcrum. If we assume that $d_1 = 1 ft$ (for simplicity), we have the equation become $200 = F_2 * d_2$. If your distance to the fulcrum ($d_2$) is 2 ft, you will need to apply 100lbs of force. If your distance to the fulcrum is 4 ft, you will need to apply 50lbs of force. This validates our answer that, yes, it is possible to get more work out of a machine than is put into it. 

Due to Comparative Advantage, it is generally accepted among economists that free-trade is the best policy for a country and increases the standard of living for the citizens of that country and the country with which it trades. I have heard, however, that there are certain instances where it would be more beneficial (on the whole for that particular country) for the country to restrict trade with other nations. Have there been instances like this where economists have advocated a trade embargo with another nation? 

It Depends. We first need to decide on which country we are going to analyze. 1) If we look at the country producing the shirts, that country just spent the resources, labor, etc. to produce both types of shirts. The industry could pile all the wrong shirts and burn them, but that would be a waste of the resources and labor that have already been used to produce the shirts. Thus, it would be bad for the first-world nation to destroy the products. It would be better to use the shirts in some capacity. With other items, this comes in the form of selling the products to regain some of the cost of production. 2) Now we will look at the third-world nation who is receiving the shirts. You have already done most of the analysis. The market is flooded with free shirts, no additional jobs are created in the shirt industry, local clothing industries don't get the business, and many of these shirt businesses go bankrupt. All of this is true. The question is whether it is bad for that country's economy. Individuals from those countries would argue that it does harm the economy. One of the better resources describing this phenomenon is the book When Helping Hurts (there are starting to be many other resources, but this is the flagship). The argument is that third-world countries are not able to develop certain industries naturally because the industries are competing with "free" goods from the first-world country. Let's look at an example. Let's say another planet produces a lot of technology, finds that it doesn't need it, and, instead of destroying it, dumps it on earth. The economy in any technology producing country on earth would suffer. Why? Because the country can't compete with free. It wouldn't be able to compete even if it had comparative/absolute advantage in that industry when compared to the other planet. Thus, the other planet would still produce technology despite the countries on earth being able to produce the same technology more efficiently and at a lower cost. This is bad for both countries. Notice the parallels between the example above and the scenario you mentioned. A first-world country produces a lot of shirts and dumps them onto a third-world country at no cost. The third-world economy suffers because, even if it could produce the shirts at a higher quality and at a lower cost, the shirt industry cannot compete with free. Thus, the first-world country will still continue to produce the shirts even if the third-world country is more efficient. This is bad for both countries. So, what is the solution? As stated above, there are three conditions that need to be satisfied in order for us to find the best possible solution. 1) The first-world nation should use the shirts in some capacity. 2) The unintentional "predatory dumping" of shirts into the third-world countries does harm their economies. 3) Allow the most efficient country to produce the shirts. The solution would be for the NFL to sell the wrong shirts to the third-world countries. The solution allows for the companies in the first-world country to regain some of the resources used to produce the bad shirts (1), stops the dumping of "free" goods into developing nations (2), and encourages competition between the industries of the countries so that the consumers purchase from the companies that produce the highest quality shirts at the highest efficiency and the lowest price (3). 

I had heard that, at the start of the Great Depression, JP Morgan and other bankers attempted to prevent the depression by purchasing some of the overpriced stock. Did the actions of JP Morgan and the other bankers have any effect on the US economy at the time? Were the effects of the Great Depression mitigated by their actions? 

An economic "bubble" bursts when the buyers in the market deem the good or service to be overpriced. At a certain point, the price of whatever is causing the bubble will reach a certain "threshold price." It is at this "threshold price" that the corresponding amount of "threshold buyers" is reached. These buyers will stop buying (or continue not to buy) the good or service offered. In an attempt to incentivize the buyers to continue buying their product, the sellers will lower their price. Of course, certain sellers will lower their prices further to out maneuver each other in order to sell more of their product. This is the burst. At this point, some of the buyers will recognize the "burst" of the "bubble market" and will become sellers to move their product. This, simultaneously, increases the amount of supply and decreases the demand, further lowering price. This cycle will continue until a new (lower) equilibrium is reached.
