(new) is the natural byproduct of your body performing work. There will be waste products as your muscles are pushed to exhaustion, and as part of normal function. The waste is carried by the blood and filtered by the liver. The liver then converts the waste products into one of the components of urine. This includes lactic acid from exercising in an anaerobic state (which your body burns more sugar than fat). 

1.5 stones is about 21 lbs (I had to look it up). That's a lot of weight, but not completely impossible. The danger that comes from extreme calorie drops has to do with making sure your body has enough of the right stuff to keep itself happy. 

In contrast to @Nathan Wheeler's answer (which was accepted), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you can compensate for an indulgence day with a no-carb/fat day (i.e. just veggies and protein). Assuming you eat healthy during most of the week, you can have one free day a week--as long as you follow it with a no-carb/fat day. So let's break down what happens when you really over-indulge. 

Kettlebells can be great assistance work in the world of strength training, so they should be placed after the main lifts in your routine. 

Honestly, I think whether you are over or under-weight it is never healthy to fixate on the scale. Total body weight is like a thermometer, it only tells you if something is wrong--but it doesn't tell you what it could be. Gaining muscle requires that you work hard, and eat a lot of food. For some reason, there are people who's bodies tell them they had enough food very early. Other people whether through years of ignoring the full signals or just genetically don't get that feeling as quickly tend to pack on weight. The hormone most associated with this affect is Leptin. If you struggle to put on weight, your body either makes too much of it, or is too sensitive to it and you stop eating before you can gain weight. If you struggle with gaining weight, then the body either doesn't make enough Leptin, or it is too insensitive to it. Leptin, like insulin, is sensitive to carb intake. Also like insulin, overstuffing yourself with carbs over time will make you insensitive to that hormone. For people already overweight, backing off carbs for a few weeks will help restore some sensitivity. If you are underweight, you may want to pack up on carbs during this time. The purpose is to decrease your sensitivity to leptin. That said, make sure you have the physical activity to match the food. Work hard to the point of depleting all the energy from you muscles, and then eat a meal with a decent amount of protein, but go for a lot of carbs. It really doesn't matter at this point what kind. The bulk of what you eat will go into your muscles to replenish what you need. So if you work your diet like this: 

Take time to read the following article just put up on the Fitocracy "Knowledge" center: "Why Weight Loss Is Not the King of Achievements". You'll see a few before and after pictures and real life body transformations. You'll also see how in many cases the weight went up or stayed the same while the results are a much tighter, fit body. Here's some tips I've come across as I've cut fat on more than one occasion: 

You should have a general idea of what you should be able to do based on the training you've done to date. If you haven't trained long enough to have an idea, I highly recommend waiting a bit. This will help you plan your warm ups. Estimating 1RM Based on Longer Sets For a ball park estimate of what you would be good for, use the formula below: 

It could be the specific choice that didn't agree with your wife. Essentially, there are a couple principles to be concerned with: 

Strength training builds muscle. In other words, the forcible contraction of your muscles against resistance is what stimulates them to get stronger or more firm. While stretching has a role, it's not to build or tone muscle. NOTE: the amount of body fat you have can accentuate or hide muscularity, so a certain amount of "toning" is done in the kitchen. A more complete picture is this: 

Do understand that the 1g per pound total body weight is a rough guideline. It will give you more than your body's daily protein requirements. The excess is burned as energy. As a rough guideline: 

Since you are still in the midst of rehab, and the other stuff will help you get stronger, I'd recommend starting with 3x5 instead of 5x5. The whole reason Stronglifts has 5x5 at the beginning is really for more practice. The problem is that it's more practice while you are still zeroing in on how your body performs the lift. My recommendations are: 

I'm willing to bet you don't do single leg work at all. It's not fun, but it is necessary to deal with things like this. Single leg work that supports squats include things like the following: 

The general principle is that if you are looking to maximize your muscle mass, you work the larger muscles more than the smaller ones (i.e. more fatigue inducing reps). That means you would work your triceps more than your biceps, your quads and glutes more than your hamstrings, etc. You would also work your back and your general core more than everything else. However, there are times where you do want to de-emphasize the larger muscles to focus on some of the smaller ones: 

Training with a partner usually generates a lot of talk. This talk is good, particularly when you are discussing the merits of training styles, checking technique, etc. But it will extend training time a bit. If the 2.5 hours is a result of the talking, then you probably are OK. The second point has to do with making sure that you don't push each other to the point of hurting yourselves. Motivate, but when form starts breaking down, intervene. If you are constantly pushing yourselves past the point of being able to train with proper technique, you are asking for injury. The last point has to do with the hormone Cortisol. Cortisol is the stress hormone, and it is the body's natural reaction to any sort of stress--both physical and mental/emotional. Cortisol is a natural part of training. After you are done training, you will also have an increase in Testosterone. Cortisol is catabolic, with a focus on getting rid of muscle tissue that has been broken down, and converting it to energy. Testosterone is anabolic, with a focus on helping your muscles recover, triggering human growth hormone, which in turn builds muscle (assuming you are eating properly). The longer the training session the more Cortisol will be built up in your system compared to the Testosterone. The absolute amounts don't matter quite as much as the relationship. The common threshold for when the balance becomes more catabolic than anabolic is about 1-1.5 hours. I wish I had studies to back up that figure, but even the articles I've found describe the phenomenon, but don't provide any sources for that information. The question is whether its the overall volume of training, or the time that is more important. And that I don't have an answer for. In general, if you belly is getting larger even though your eating is in good shape, that is an indicator of the type of effect Cortisol has on your system. Shortening your training time to about 1-1.5 hours should help curb that. If you still need 2.5 hours overall, you always have the option of splitting the training into morning and evening training to stay within the ideal time frames. If your belly is staying the same size, then I wouldn't worry too much about it. 

It's times like this that your body is fatigued. More than likely it's a cumulative affect from the training you've done up till this point, poor nutrition choices, and possibly some life stresses in there. This is normal. Essentially your body needs some relative rest. 

The primary goal for your diet is to make sure you are eating good things in the right amounts to achieve your goals. To lose weight, you need to know roughly how many calories you burn normally. After that, you adjust by dropping a couple hundred calories at a time until you are losing roughly 1-2 pounds a week. 

I highly doubt it. In general, cramps are caused by electrolyte imbalances and make your muscles contract uncontrollably for a period of time. The long term damage would be no more than what would happen if you contracted your muscles for the same amount of time. Now, you will need to fix the electrolyte imbalances with proper rest and hydration. According to the article that I linked to, the only time you should be concerned is if you chronically get the cramping in the same set of muscles without causing the cramp by your exercise. It's an indication of nerve root disease. However, that doesn't apply to the situation you described here. The best prevention for cramps is a good hydration routine. When you are doing long distance biking or running, you should probably keep some Gatorade or other sports drink on you so you can remain hydrated throughout your ride. The sports drinks help maintain the proper electrolyte imbalances so you don't experience the severe pain that you did. 

An insulin spike after an intense workout helps push energy where it is sorely needed: your muscles. The common prevailing thought is that that conveys to other needed nutrients like protein. Whether it truly is cause and effect or simply correlation, your muscles are ready to absorb protein as well post workout. Without knowing what the percentages of the different ingredients are, these are pretty good recovery supplements. The problem is the amounts. Let's contrast this with the AMP Wheybolic Extreme: 

If you are on StrongLifts 5x5, a beginner program, then the problems associated with endurance training and max effort training won't be severe enough to worry about. First, a 5K takes less than an hour to complete. Second, you haven't gotten to the place in your training where you really have to choose which way you need to go. Now, to keep your 5K training more in line with weightlifting in general, focus on interval training between running and jogging. But you should be fine right now. 

As far as lifts go, it is important to keep your muscles balanced or you could wind up with some bad injury. That said, the general principle I've been able to pick up on from different weight lifting sites is this:
