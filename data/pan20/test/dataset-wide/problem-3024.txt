James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales are among the earliest examples of serial publishing. This was not originally planned as a series, nor did Cooper set out to publish a set number of novels. However, the profitability of these novels led Cooper to revisit the main character and his family several times over. The incentive to publish serially increased in the 19th century, as books began to develop a mass consumer base. Before this, authors might revisit a written work or character for artistic reasons, but now authors and publishers would publish works in a series in hopes of maintaining their large and profitable readership. This is similar to the dynamic that had developed centuries earlier around popular characters in plays (like Falstaff, who Shakespeare revisited twice). Of course, plays had developed this dynamic first because they had developed a mass audience first. No mass audience and no commercial publishing would remove many of the incentives for authors to write serialized novels.* The contemporary model of a pre-announced number of books intended to cover a predefined story progression within a given world is often attributed to E.E. Smith's Lensman series of the 1940s and 1950s. Incidentally, the Lensman was a work of science fiction, and may have set an important precedent in this genre. Book series are popularly associated today with sci-fi and epic fantasy. 

I think a bit of context might help. The natives Cortes is talking about had been subject tribes of the Aztecs who took the opprotunity to rise against them and to ally themselves with the Spanish. What Cortes was doing, then, was browbeating his allies into submission by the threat of turning them over to their erstwhile masters. A somewhat underhanded technique, of course. This has nothing to do, as far as I can tell, with the comparative advantages of Spanish or Aztec rule, just a bit of power play on Cortes's part. 

In an interesting vignette, it turns out that the Druze emir of Lebanon, Fakhr-al-Din, had traveled in the early 17th century to Florence and tried to conclude a military alliance with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Why, of all places, Tuscany? This raises some questions and conjectures: 

Regrettably, he does not pause to consider that this demolishes his argument about the leading role played by the Communists during the war. UPDATE: The Stilwell Papers I looked up the The Stilwell Papers. It's basically a diary+letters (starting in December 1941) written by General Stilwell and edited by White. Since Ienaga did not give any page numbers in his reference to Stilwell, I had to consult the index. I found no entry about the 8th Route Army but there are 7 entries under "Communists", mostly casual and favourable mentions. The only one which seems to be relevant is on p.324: 

Source: Alex Ross' The Rest is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century, p. 82. Highly recommended. It also has a chapter devoted to Shostakovich. 

The photorealists are clearly not, to a man, more talented than Vermeer and others like him. They are simply using their art to convey a message that no artist before the modern era would ever have needed or wanted to convey. 

The two claims are not incompatible. There was certainly a very large Islamic influence on the Italian Renaissance. Many classical texts are largely known to us through transmission via the Islamic world. For example, see Wikipedia's article on the Transmission of the Greek Classics. Interpretations of the classical texts, like those of Aristotle, were heavily influenced by Islamic thinkers such as Averroes (his latinzed name). According to Wiki: 

One kind of shoe not mentioned in the other answers are those using bast soles. "Bast" is fiber from tree bark. Bast shoes or lapti, were once worn by poorer members of Northern European cultures. These were usually made from birch or linden. They are woven like a basket, and so are quite distinct from the wooden clog or hard wooden-soled shoes mentioned in the other answers. 

A) The earliest documentation I've found regarding the use of sharkskin as sandpaper goes back to the British Empire in the mid 18th century. Sharkskin was apparently only used to finish very fine work: 

I have noticed that virtually all Roman emperors after Constantine were called Flavius Something. A quick lookup in wikipedia confirms this and even more: 

Here is what I came up with so far. The lictors are mentioned in the Theodosian Code (This is from footnote n.46 in this paper). More evidence for them at the end of the 4th century CE can be adduced from Gibbon who says that one Ammonius "expired under the rod of the lictor". I don't know what was Gibbon's reference for that but he can be trusted to get such things right. So we know that lictors were still in vogue in the 5th century. When did they disappear? My present guess is that Heraclius might have abolished them as part of his reforms that swept a lot of the Roman heritage away. But that's just a guess, I'll keep looking for a real answer. I also found this tantalizing pointer: 

Basically, this is a lot of tosh. This, ahem, quaint theory is a nice specimen of the modern neo-Stalinist cottage industry. Reality was much simpler: the purges were ordered and organized by Stalin; no alternative elections were ever held in the Soviet Union (till the late 1980s when the system was in its death throes). This was of course by design - the party and Stalin were not willing to relinquish their monopoly of power. The neo-Stalinists try to rewrite history in various ways. In this particular instance they try to argue that Stalin had nothing to do with the purges and that the "party elites" organized them in order to stimy Stalin's liberal reforms. This is really rich... One simple question can clear up all this smoke and mirrors: if the "elites" were behind the purges and if they organized them against Stalin - why didn't they just purge Stalin himself? 

The War of 1812 had six official endings: one for at land and five for at sea. The Treaty of Ghent states: "All hostilities both by sea and land shall cease as soon as this Treaty shall have been ratified by both parties as hereinafter mentioned." The American Senate ratified the treaty on February 16th, 1815, making this the earliest defensible date for the end of the war. Consequential fighting on land lasted right up until ratification, well past the Battle of New Orleans. Andrew Jackson and the British invasion force knew that the war hadn't ended with the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson refused to rescind his order for martial law in New Orleans until he received some indication that peace had been reached by negotiators in Europe (Brands p. 287). The British, realizing the vulnerability of the Gulf coast, sailed away from New Orleans to American-occupied Spanish-owned Mobile Bay. The Second Battle of Fort Bowyer (February 7-12, 1815) was the last land battle between the British and Americans.* It was the beginning of a British campaign to take Mobile from the Americans. Despite Jackson's boast that "ten thousand men cannot take it," the fort surrendered to the British after a five-day siege. With Fort Bowyer captured, the British prepared to march on Mobile itself. They postponed their attack upon receiving news of the Treaty of Ghent, and they withdrew from the area altogether when they learned that the American Senate had ratified the treaty on February 16. How important was the Second Battle of Fort Bowyer? The Mobile area was the only territory that changed ownership due to the War of 1812. Because it was Spanish-owned, Mobile was not covered in the Treaty of Ghent. It's possible that if the British force had been able to take Mobile before news from Ghent arrived, then the Americans would not have acquired Mobile until later in their history. Mobile would became the second largest cotton-exporting port in the United States, so a long-term consequence of the acquisition of Mobile was the intensification of slave agriculture in the deep South. Five Endings for the War at Sea: The Treaty of Ghent specified five specific dates after which prizes taken at sea would be invalidated. Ships further from the North American Coast could keep prizes up to 120 days after ratification. For details for the five ending dates for the various naval theaters, see "Article the Second": 

The 2011 Tucson shooting also seems to be such a case. The shooting took place at a constituent meeting held by Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords. While the shooter was insane his specific form of insanity included some sort of political mania. 

However, quite puzzlingly, artillery just didn't quite catch on with the Persians or others, as Thompson himself notes a bit later: 

Indeed, in a somewhat similar situation, in the 15th century Italian Condottieri such as Sforza, Braccio da Montone and Malatesta did use their mercenary armies to seize control of city-states and become dukes and lords. However, in 17th century Northern Europe such a development was more or less unthinkable. The reason is, I think, that the power in 17th century states had a different source of legitimacy - it was based on more than naked coercion, but on some variation on the divine right of kings/dukes/princes etc. The more complex structure of the economy also played an important role. Also, one can take control of a city-state using armed force (in a time-honoured tradition, going back at least to the Greek tyrants starting with Cypselus) but it's much more difficult to control a large state using mercenary troops - one would only be in possession of the capital and even if the rest of the country doesn't rise up against the usurper, how would one collect the revenue? And without revenue, you can't control your mercenaries. This issue was grasped well by the contemporaries. The only example that comes to mind of a mercenary captain who tried to turn himself into a ruler is, of course, Wallenstein. And even in his case, it is important to note that before he could really proceed with his ambitious plans he first had to acquire a solid territorial base, the duchy of Mecklenburg, in the "usual way" - receiving it from the Emperor. UPDATE: So far I've explained why a coup by a mercenary captain stood no chance of success. Regarding the wider issue broached at the title of the question: why wasn't the ruling class subverted by the mercenary captains, the answer is actually quite simple: the captains belonged to the ruling class themselves. 

Without knowing the materials used to make that ball, it's hard to tell how heavy it would be. This site goes over the possibilities: 

Similar fears were raised about bicycles and automobiles -- which were feared because in some sense they too were "forms of communication," as OP put it. In particular, automobiles might facilitate intercourse between the sexes, if you follow (27). As a preacher in the Lynd's Middletown Study put it, an automobile is a "house of prostitution on wheels." Lovers of domestic simplicity feared that the telephone destroyed the sanctity of the home: 

Though there were still scattered cases of indentured servants in America in the 1830s, at that point it was long clear to planters that they could more readily attain African slaves than indentured Europeans. TLDR: This may be a case where it is better not to think in terms of cause and effect, but in terms of reciprocal causation: As indentured servitude became less attractive to Europeans, slavery became that much more attractive to American planters. As the slave economy developed, it became that much easier for American planters to purchase slaves. At some point around the end of the 18th century, the math was such that planters nearly always purchased a slave over buying the contract of an indentured servant. 

Actually, I don't think there was any Jewish theatre at all at the time. I don't have an academic source at hand but this webpage seems to sum up things pretty well. Look especially in the section "Changing Attitudes under Hellenism". 

Tiberius Gracchus tried to push through his reforms programme while holding the magistracy of a tribune of the plebs. I wonder, though, why he did not try to get elected as consul (very likely given his family connections and personal distinction) and to enact his reforms then. This would have taken more time but wouldn't it have a better prima facie chance of working out? Or was he afraid of getting saddled with a veto-wielding conservative colleague in the consulship? Are there ancient or modern sources discussing this angle? 

In fact, the Nazis kept a group of captured important political leaders in a special subcamp of Buchenwald, as sort of hostages, under relatively mild conditions. For some reason I am unable now to find a single source with a full list of the VIP prisoners (I recall once having read such a webpage). Anyway, the subcamp was called "Fichtenhain Special Camp" and this google book has some valuable information on it. This webpage is also useful. Here's the most relevant section: 

You are not going to find these statistics. I put the evidence for this “below the fold.” Basically, crime stats experts all say that crime stats are unreliable before the mid-20th century. However, I think private trips must have been robbed at much higher rates than commercial trips for the simple reason that the vast majority of highwaymen operated in the frontiers, where economic activity was overwhelmingly “private.” Read through Wikipedia's descriptions of American highwaymen, and you'll see that they mostly preyed on private travelers on isolated frontier roads. According to Wikipedia's highwaymen list, the last New England highwaymen died in 1821. Well, New England (and the other developed coastal regions) are where the vast majority of the nation's commercial activity occurred. Banks didn't have that much incentive to be shuttling large shipments of gold across Illinois. If they did need to transport something as bulky as gold coast to coast, they'd take a boat. Because the majority of commercial traffic occurred in the safest parts of the country, commercial trips must have been, statistically speaking, very safe. One wrinkle is that river pirates were probably more important than road agents/highwaymen. In an era of worthless paper currency, transportation is a major limitation to efficient robbery. Unless you are able to consistently target victims carrying high value-to-weight ratios (e.g. rich folk with pocket watches and diamond jewelry--unlikely on the frontier), you simply can't carry away much value after a robbery. It's also hard to make speedy getaway down backroads when weighed down with bulky item. Furthermore, how do you fence unusual stolen goods on the frontier? Even if you didn't have to worry about giving yourself away by constantly selling pocket watches, who on the frontier is paying top dollar for pocket watches? The problem of transportation is likely why the most ambitious robbers were river pirates. Farmers are constantly drifting down waterways on rafts and boats loaded with valuable commodities. A pirate relieves them of their wheat, then floats downstream and sells it himself. This is much safer, because you can't prove that wheat once belonged to a particular farmer (like you can with a pocket watch), and you know that riverside towns are teeming with factors looking to purchase commodities. Plus, river pirates were able to put greater distances between where they committed crimes, where they sold stolen goods, and where they lived. This was undoubtedly important--once again, read through the biographies of the highwaymen on Wikipedia, and you'll see that a significant portion of them were eventually routed by local posses. PS- I know that 19th century bank robbers and train robbers have an outsized grip on the American imagination thanks to Westerns, but for the most part 19th century banking was very staid. 

Russia doesn't appear in wikipedia's accounts of the Morean War or of the preceding Battle of Vienna. I find that mildly suprising. Perhaps the reason is that before Peter Russia was less active with her southern frontier? Question: Is there a recorded Russian position on this conflicts? 

There are some coins which show her. But can you be 100% sure that the designers of the coins did not perform an ancient analogue of photoshopping on them? I'm afraid not. 

If early Roman history is to be believed (it isn't really true, as we know, but it's such a darn good read...), then Sextus Tarquinius would be pretty high on the list: 

Presumably this would be ancient Rome during the early Empire. The best numbers available come, I think, from Augustus' official autobiography. The English text can be found here. In paragraph 8 he says that in the Empire-wide census of 14CE "were counted 4,937,000 of the heads of Roman citizens". Now, it seems to be a vexing questions for historians what this number actually means - some think it includes women and children, who could not vote. Also, a great number of the citizens didn't live in Rome so could not vote. How many voting citizens resided in Rome then? Well, in paragraph 15 Augustus goes on to say: "I gave to 320,000 plebs of the city HS 240 per man". So, I'd say 320,000 is your brutto number. How many of those actually bothered to show up for the elections? I don't know; to judge by modern participation ratios, it could be as few as 20%, i.e. 64,000. Of course, it is rather ironic that absolutely nothing hinged on the result of the elections at that time. EDIT: Playing it safely, we can go for Athens at its height. There are various estimates of how many citizens there were, but 50,000 is very near the top of the high end. There we can presume a very high participation ratio (Athens, the birthplace of direct democracy and all that). So I'd shoot at about 40,000. Maybe Republican Rome had more but not by an order of a magnitude. Perhaps experts on Roman assemblies could weigh in here. EDIT2: The modern high end estimate for Athenian citizen population is the work of Mogens Herman Hansen who developed what he calls "the shotgun method". A brief summary of the figures I was relying on can be found here.
