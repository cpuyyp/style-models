Your inequality is not true in general. You can have $\int_{\partial\Omega} p^2 dS >\int_{\partial\Omega^*} (p^*)^2 dS^* + C(A^*-A)$ for any $C$ while keeping $L$ and $A$ a priori bounded. Indeed, $$ \int_{\partial\Omega} p^2 dS = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{r^4}{\sqrt{r^2+{r'}^2}} d\theta $$ where $r=r(\theta)$ is the radial function and $\theta$ is the angular coordinate. Begin with $\Omega^*$ being a polygon approximating a long and narrow ellipse. Its radial function $r^*(\theta)$ is piecewise smooth. Approximate $r^*$from below by a piecewise constant function so that the difference is bounded by a small $\varepsilon$. Near points of discuntinuity, connect the constant pieces by linear functions with almost infinite derivative. The resulting function is $r(\theta)$. If the approximation is chosen so that $r=r^*$ at points corresponding to vertices of the original polygon $\Omega^*$, then $\Omega^*$ is indeed the convex hull of the set $\Omega$ defined by $r(\theta)$. However, $$ \int_{\partial\Omega} p^2 dS \approx \int_0^{2\pi} r^3 d\theta\ge \int_0^{2\pi} (r^*-\varepsilon)^3 d\theta > \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{(r^*)^4}{\sqrt{(r^*)^2+{(r^*)'}^2}} = \int_{\partial\Omega^*} (p^*)^2 dS^* $$ for $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small, since the term ${(r*)'}^2$ in the denominator is not negligible. Moreover, $\int p^2 dS - \int(p^*)^2$ is bounded away from zero, but $A^*-A\to 0$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $L$ stays bounded, so the difference $\int p^2 dS - \int(p^*)^2$ is not majored by $C(L,A)(A^*-A)$. 

For what is worth, here is a simple coordinate example in dimension 6. Take $$ \omega_0 = dx_1\wedge dx_2 + dx_3\wedge dx_4 + dx_5\wedge dx_6 , $$ $$ \omega_1 = dx_1\wedge dx_3 + dx_2\wedge dx_4 , $$ $$ \omega_2 = dx_3\wedge dx_5 + dx_4\wedge dx_6 , $$ $$ \omega_3 = dx_5\wedge dx_1 + dx_6\wedge dx_2 . $$ The sum of squares of these forms is zero, but the square of any nontrivial linear combination is not. 

The statement is true. It is almost precisely Lemma 2 in the paper D.Burago, "Periodic metrics", Adv. Soviet Math. 9, (1992), 205-210. The proof is short but not easy to invent. The paper can be read on Google Books here. Notes on the text: the intervals in the formulation of Lemma 2 are in fact disjoint, the term "antipodal map" means "odd map" (i.e. $\varphi(-x)=-\varphi(x)$). For $k=2$, this fact is classic and one can replace 0.5 by any inverse integer ($1/3, 1/4,\dots$) but for every other value there is a counter-example. 

I suspect there is some terminology confusion here. Without the axioms 1 and 2, what you define is just a 1-dimensional polyhedral space (they are usually called metric graphs). Or, more precisely, the set of vertices of a metric graph with the induced distance. The "weights" are usually referred to as "edge lengths". The axioms impose an additional requirement that the shortest paths of the "weighted" metric are the same as those of the "unweighted" one. This is a very unusual requirement, and I wonder where it comes from. By the way, it is not satisfied in the triangulation example from your last question. Concerning bi-Lipschitz embeddings: if the edge lengths are bounded away from 0 and infinity, then there is no difference from the unit lengths (the two metrics are bi-Lipschitz equivalent). And if they are not bounded, then any tree (I mean the set of vertices) can be bi-Lipschitz embedded into $\mathbb R$. Assign the $k$-th edge the length $10^k$, then the distance between any two vertices is dominated by the longest edge between them. Now mark one of the vertices as the origin and, for every vertex $x$, let $f(x)$ be the distance from $x$ to the origin. Then $f$ is a bi-Lipschitz map to $\mathbb R$. I wonder what you mean by quasi-isometry (in your curvature bound definition). The notion of quasi-isometry I am used to allows arbitrary bi-Lipshitz rescaling, so the supremum and infimum of $\delta$ do not make sense. What you define is Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. This property is preserved under quasi-isometries, but the actual value of $\delta$ is not. As for you last question, I presume that you are talking about the lift of the triangulation to the universal cover of the manifold (otherwise it is just a finite graph). In this case the graph is certainly Gromov-hyperbolic because it is quasi-isometric to the universal cover itself (with its negatively curved metric). 

The space of all functions $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ with the topology of pointwise convergence is obviously sequential but not first countable. Indeed, for every $x\in\mathbb R$, the set $U_x:=\{f:|f(x)|<1\}$ is open. If the space had a countable base of neighborhoods of 0, every set of the form $U_x$ would contain an element of the base. So some element $U$ of the base would be contained in infinitely many sets $U_{x_1}, U_{x_2}, \dots$ and hence in the intersection $V=\bigcap U_{x_i}$. But 0 is not in the interior of $V$ because there is a sequence of functions outside $V$ that pointwise converges to 0. Namely the $n$th member of the sequence is the characteristic function of the set $\{x_i:i\ge n\}$. 

It is not compact unless you allow the origin at the boundary (or maybe impose some kind of uniform strict convexity). Consider a rectangle $K=[-1,1]\times[-\delta,1]$ in the plane, where $\delta$ is positive and goes to 0. If $K$ intersects some lattice only at the origin then so does $-K$, by symmetry. But $K\cup -K$ is a convex symmetric set of area 4, hence $\Delta(K)=\Delta(K\cup -K) \ge 1$ by Minkowski's theorem. Therefore the ratio $vol/\Delta$ is bounded for all such $K$, but they have no limit in $\mathcal K^2_0$ as $\delta\to 0$. 

You can uniformly cook the cube if $f$ is harmonic, i.e. $\Delta f=0$. Note that, if e.g. $\Delta f>0$ everywhere, then the center of the cube will always receive less heat than the average over a sphere with the same center. Thus if $\Delta f$ happens to have constant sign, it must be zero. To achieve uniform cooking in the harmonic case, let the center of the cube stay at the origin and rotate the cube using a Peano-like curve $\gamma:[0,1]\to SO(n)$ such that the push-forward measure $\gamma_*m$ (where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$) is the normalized Haar measure on $SO(n)$. Then the heat received by a point $x\in I^n$ is the average of $f$ over the sphere of radius $r=|x|$ centered at the origin. Since $f$ is harmonic, this average value equals $f(0)$. To construct such a curve $\gamma$, follow the standard procedure for the Peano curve: partition $SO(n)$ into reasonable sets (connected and with piecewise smooth boundaries) and visit all of them by a continuous path; this path is the first approximation. Then subdivide the partition and change the path so that it visits all sub-parts but do not make new intersections with boundaries of old parts. And so on. At each step, choose the parametrization so that the time spent in each piece equals its Haar volume. Let the diameters go to zero, then the paths will converge to a Peano-like curve $\gamma$. The push-forward measure $\gamma_*m$ coincides with the Haar measure on all elements of the partitions and hence on all Borel sets. Remark. A similar trick works if $f$ has compact support (more precisely, its support should be separated away from the microwave walls by distance at least 1). Just move around so as to realize a Haar measure on the relevant subset of the translation group rather than $SO(n)$. 

I assume you are seeking a lower bound for $r$ for configurations of a fixed total area $A$, otherwise it just does not make sense. Yes the bound is $\sim C\sqrt{A/n}$ for some constant $C>0$ but I don't know what is the exact value of $t$. Indeed, $r=\sqrt{A/\pi n}$ always works. Indeed, pick arbitrary points $x_i\in S_i$ and consider balls $B_i$ of radius $r$ centered at $x_i$. The sum of areas of $B_i$ equals $A$, hence they do not cover the union $\bigcup S_i$ (or they are disjoint, in which case the points $x_i$ are a good configuration). So there is a point $x$ in some $S_{i^*}$ not covered by these balls. Move $x_{i^*}$ to this point and you are done. On the other hand, there are collections $\{S_i\}$ such that $r=\sqrt{2A/\pi n}$ does not work. Indeed, consider the following configuration for even $n$: for each $j\le n/2$, $S_{2j-1}$ is a single point and $S_{2j}$ is the open ball centered at this point, with the center removed. The centers are chosen far away from one another so that the sets are disjoint. Clearly for any choice $x_i\in S_i$, we have $|x_{2j}-x_{2j-1}|<r$, and the total area equals $A$. To see that there is a specific limit constant $C$, let $A_n$ denote the supremum of total areas of $n$ sets such that $F(X)\le 1$ for any selection $X=\{x_i\}$, $x_i\in S_i$. It is easy to see that the sequence $A_n$ is subadditive: $A_{m+n}\le A_m+A_n$. Indeed, an example with $m+n$ can be contracted as the union of examples with $m$ and $n$ sets (translated far away from each other so that they become disjoint). Hence there is a limit $A_\infty = \lim A_n/n$ and then $C=1/\sqrt{A_\infty}$. 

A stronger fact holds: If $\lambda_1\le\lambda_2\le\dots\le\lambda_m$ are the eigenvalues of $A$, and $\mu_1\le\mu_2\le\dots\le\mu_p$ are eigenvalues of $Z^TAZ$, then $\mu_k\ge\lambda_k$ for all $k=1,\dots,p$. Update: This fact is well-known as Cauchy interlacing theorem. Proof. Let $Q$ be the quadratic form on $\mathbb R^m$ defined by $A$ (that is, $Q(x)=x^TAx$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^m$), $L:\mathbb R^p\to\mathbb R^m$ the (isometric) linear map defined by $Z$. Then $Z^TAZ$ is the matrix of the quadratic form $Q'$ on $\mathbb R^p$ given by $Q'(x)=Q(L(x))$. I suggest you think of $Q'$ as the restriction of $Q$ to the subspace $L(\mathbb R^p)$ of $\mathbb R^m$. Suppose that $\mu_k<\lambda_k$ for some $k$. Let $V$ be the $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb R^p$ spanned by the first $k$ eigenvectors of $Q'$. Then $Q'(x)\le \mu_k |x|^2$ for all $x\in V$. Let $W$ be the $(m-k+1)$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb R^m$ spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda_k,\lambda_{k+1},\dots,\lambda_m$. Then $Q(x)\ge\lambda_k|x|^2$ for all $x\in W$. The subspaces $W$ and $L(V)$ have nonzero intersection since the sum of their dimensions is greater than $m$. Hence there exists a nonzro vector $x\in V$ such that $L(x)\in W$. For this vector, we have $Q'(x)\le \mu_k |x|^2 <\lambda_k|x|^2$ but $Q'(x)=Q(L(x))\ge \lambda_k|L(x)|^2=\lambda_k|x|^2$, a contradiction. Q.E.D. Similarly (inverting all inequalities in the argument) one sees that the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of $Q'$ is no greater than the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of $Q$, answering your second question.
