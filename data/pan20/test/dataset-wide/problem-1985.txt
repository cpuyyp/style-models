I work in a very small office consisting of 8 people. We have 1 member of staff who is a little bit odd, comes out with random remarks and has a very different view on the world. I'm going to call her Trish in this post. Every person in the office has discussed her strangeness at some point, in no way is it ever put in a cruel or vindictive way. She had a mental breakdown a while ago and the company even paid for professional help as we did want to lose her as she is perfect at her job. Due to this we are all actually quite protective of her as she is very timid and child like even though she is older than me. So basically this morning I was pulled aside by one of my managers to say 'Trish' was crying earlier at another member of staff as she had been on my computer and seen an email that I had sent to a friend/colleague. We have little chats every now and again when working, silly things like today is going so slow or what you doing (we're not in the office) anyway this one particular email had a comment from me saying 'Trish is being morbid again, keeps asking me what she is supposed to do if her partner dies suddenly. Asked if there was something wrong with him but nope he perfectly healthy. It was just a random thought that came into her head. I explained to my friend that I was struggling to know how to respond to these types of comments as it a bit weird. didn't really think anything else of it. 'Trish' has said to the colleague she was crying at that I'm a bully, I'm cruel, and she's applied for another job as she doesn't want to work with me any more. First of all I feel bad for the comment I made in the email but it was never meant in a cruel way. Me and 'Trish' have often joked about the strange things that pop into her head and her compulsive worrying. She always comes to me to talk. secondly my issue is that this email is actually from 6 months ago so for some reason she has gone looking through my work emails which is not allowed especially since I have a lot of confidential items in my emails i.e wage information, vendor agreements, bank information/agreements. thirdly she said she saw the email this morning and she has also applied for a job this morning so has used company pc's to look and apply for different work. I don't know how to respond to the situation. Should I confront her about it or just leave it as she told the original member of staff not to say anything. But he did as the word bully got out in the conversation. In no way would I ever try to make someone feel bad but I also feel like she should never of seen the email if she wasn't snooping on my machine. I'm just very confused right now. 

Is my local area's job market sufficient such that there are multiple jobs at my desired level of "depth". Can I find another job in my chosen subfield easily? Or will it take a lot of work? Do I want to stay focussed on the same problem my whole career, getting a very deep understanding and learning multiple ways to solve that problem, or do I want to always be learning new, disparate things even if its only surface level? Where do I want to be in that spectrum? Do I want to command a higher salary, even if it means taking longer to find the job that best fits me? Or will I be ok on a smaller salary but more stability? 

Well the correct answer is both! If you could be very broad and very deep, and know everything wouldn't you? Alas though, even geniuses have their limits. So we have to chose what skills we are going to grow vs those we're going to sacrifice. Generally it boils down to how much of a commodity you're going to be. With a lot of breadth, you will always be marketable with a large skillset. You have more opportunities. However, as your skills are mostly surface skills, you will be more commoditized. That is to say, with more supply, eventually the salaries drive lower as the odds increase there's someone who can write that iPhone app for $30/hour where you want to charge $32/hour. The extreme example of "breadth" is manual labor which everyone can do and is very heavily commoditized. With depth, the opportunities are scarcer. However, with deep knowledge you are competing in a smaller workforce. You'll likely be able to demand more $$ for your work as there are only a few people with those skills. You're not a commodity. The ultimate example of all-depth is someone with a PhD. You are so focused on a single problem that somebody may pay you through the nose to help solve that problem. You may, however, have problems finding the handful of people desperate to solve that subproblem. Depth can also be more brittle, the problem you're solving may pretty much be solved one day, making your job obsolete. You have to find what balance is most appropriate to you between "manual laborer" and "PhD student". Software Engineer is already some level of depth as obviously not everyone can do it. But do you want to be deeper than that? I'd take some things into account: 

Personal anecdote time (because it's always personal anecdote time): I left a company under, uh, less-than-favorable circumstances. I had been the CTO, so naturally I had access to every system. A few weeks later, I noticed that my user-name and password still worked on the production database. This was typical of the kind of slip-shod behavior that led to my leaving in the first place. Disgruntled ex-employees are always the first suspects if there is a hacking attack, and if one happened, I didn't want anyone to be able to say that "Well, Malvolio still knows the password." So I sent an impersonally worded email to the CEO, telling him to change it. Two weeks later, I checked again, and it had not been changed. I sent the CEO an even more impersonally worded email, to the effect that if my password still worked in 48 hours, I would post the username and password on Hacker News. My sources reported back that the CEO instantly called a meeting of all the remaining engineers and ordered that every password and every username in the system be changed. He wasn't very bright. But that wouldn't be a good solution in the OP's situation, even though he is in almost a precarious position as I was. Since he does not wish to appear petty, this is the perfect time to rely on the passive voice: 

Look at this picture? What do you see? That's right: whole lot of red flags. Do not take this job. Ignore the crappy salary. Ignore the passive-aggressive way HR conducts itself. Even ignore the general entitled mindset of "if you need a higher salary to work here, you don't appreciate what a God-given opportunity we are". Just realize that almost all of your future colleagues would have submitted themselves to the same degrading processes you are going through. Perhaps you are in some special circumstance that makes you more receptive to such a distasteful offer, but statistically, most of the other people weren't. They were mediocrities who didn't have a lot of other choices. Decline and, if you feel like it, send a letter to the CEO, saying politely that you would have liked to have worked there, but the unprofessional behavior of their HR department kept that from happening.
