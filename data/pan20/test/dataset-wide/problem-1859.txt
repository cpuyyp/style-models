You can ask for anything. Given that you have changed your mind several times, it won't be a huge surprise if they don't accommodate your wishes. Still it's worth asking. 

Sometimes managers must be the "bad guy". Why don't you consider this your obligation? You selected him, right? You manage/supervise him, right? Let him go now. Learn from this what you can do to choose a better student next time. [Note: obey all local laws with whatever actions you choose] 

Either you have accepted the job offer, or led the company to believe you will accept the job offer. And the company is spending time preparing your contract and making preparations for you to go to live and work in Turkey. At the same time, you are planning to go to school if accepted, leaving this company, and haven't told them your plans. So clearly, there will be problems with the company. You will leave them in a bind. You will burn all bridges there. Anyone who knows what you did will likely not want to work with you again. If you eventually sign a contract and quit abruptly, there may be legal problems (depending on local laws and customs). In some locales this could affect your future employability. And there will be problems with your reputation. People will think you are dishonest at best, and a liar at worst. You will prove to others that you cannot be trusted to follow through on your promises. To me this would be the worst potential problem, since I value my reputation a lot. 

That's a tough call. Unless you choose to go full-time, many companies wouldn't pay you an hourly wage equivalent to full-time. Part-time and full-time simply aren't the same in many companies. 

I see absolutely no reason to avoid applying. And there's no reason to avoid mentioning your employment in your letter. It's not against the "rules", and I'd be hard-pressed to imagine any CEO I've ever worked for would take offense to someone who was currently working in their company being good enough to be scholarship-material. It reflects well on them as well as you. While I don't think you can expect favoritism due to your employment status, I'd expect you to be considered equally with all the other non-employee applicants. Years ago, I got a small scholarship from a company I was working for on a part-time basis. After graduation, I went full-time in the home office. The company President spoke to me shortly after my full-time hire and said something along the lines of "this is what we were hoping for when we gave you the scholarship". 

Using anything other than your real name on your resume would be foolish. Your resume is about the real you, not some fictional identity you choose to cloak yourself in. (The famous New Yorker cartoon "On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog" comes to mind.) In a cover letter or during an interview, you could mention your Max Rockwood fake name if that helps identify your work. (I'm not saying you should change it. But in some circles, the fake name "Max Rockwood" could be viewed as something a porn star would use.) 

You could tell them that you need an offer within a week, or you will withdraw your application. That will get you a very quick answer, but it may not be the answer you are looking for. I probably wouldn't suggest that approach for most candidates. Perhaps the best you can do is indicate that you are actively interviewing elsewhere. If for some reason the hiring managers have already decided that you are the most qualified candidate they have seen to date, they may choose to short-circuit their plans. More likely, they won't speed things up if "they have to go through the other applicants" as you have indicated. Sometimes these things just have to play themselves out. You'll have to decide if you can live with the process as it is, or move on to other potential jobs. 

That depends on your goal. If you want to return to the company and if interning at one company multiple times isn't frowned upon by your school, then do so. If you don't want to return then thank them but indicate you have found an internship elsewhere. 

That's not surprising. Consultants are often hired to provide expert advice and their paid advice is often followed accordingly. You were most likely not hire to provide expert advice (even if you are capable of providing it). 

I guess we don't travel in the same circles. Most companies where I have worked, and most that I know enough about to know their hiring practices, do a pretty good job of background checks, and don't make hiring decisions for technical folks based solely on non-technical HR interviews. Perhaps you should talk to these people you know, and point out the problems you see - without creating a specific blacklist of individuals? You know - teach them how to fish, rather than giving them a fish to eat. 

If you need to leave, and others want to chat, you simply say "Hey, I'd love to chat, but I have a bus to catch! Let's pick this up again in the morning." And then you leave. You can't make unreliable buses reliable. Those things are out of your control. But you can control your own actions. Start making it a priority to get to work on time, avoid trying to figure out "how late can I be and still not be considered late", and avoid making excuses. 

This is extremely industry-, locale- and company-specific. Some jobs seem to tolerate language that could easily get you fired elsewhere. 

She should move to the US where the company is paying 5x to 10x and see if she can get hired there. Realistically, companies that want to hire locally, pay wages consistent with the locale. The act of being acquired doesn't change that. And often acquisitions are made with cheaper overseas labor in mind. 

If you worked in my company, I'd advise you to be completely honest with your manager (perhaps me, perhaps someone else). Without that you still might be able to gain the flexibility you desire, but it would be far less likely, and far harder to achieve. If you worked for me, I'd want you to educate me enough about your condition, so that I could understand your proposal. I'd want to understand how working from home would help you think more clearly and be able to handle the rigors of the job better. I'd want to understand what you meant by "I also want to be able to work from home so that I can catch up on sleep" and how that is going to help you get the work done. You still might not be granted the flexible working arrangement, even if you did open up, but I think it might help tip the scales in your favor. In my company at least, your manager wants to see you succeed, and will help as much as circumstances allow. Sometimes that means flexibility in the work is possible, sometimes business circumstances dictate otherwise. 

It's not reasonable. Injecting politics into a job search portfolio invites criticism from both the pro- and con- side of the question. Folks will almost certainly ascribe biases to your project, not matter how well-intentioned. Thus, a percentage of your readers will always be turned off by your project. Using a more neutral topic or person as the target of your Twitter API project will avoid the obvious risk. And you could certainly showcase your technical abilities without resorting to politics. You want the focus of your portfolio to be on your talent, not your choice of content topics. There are plenty of non-political topics/people that would be appropriate and would surely lead to fewer negative consequences. 

There's no way to know without a lot more details, but "fault" isn't something that should worry you anyway. Every company has a unique culture. Some companies value quiet, steady work. Other companies value loud cowboys. In some companies you can grow to more senior roles naturally and easily. In some companies, you can campaign actively for a promotion when a new job opens up and be considered. In other companies, once a newbie always a newbie. Knowing what is important within your company and maximizing those attributes only comes with time and experience. Perhaps you were too young and too new to learn that. And sometimes the only way to get paid market value is to actually put yourself on the market. My first professional job was a good one in many aspects. I learned a lot, had a good mentor, was well-respected and enjoyed the work. But the pay was sub-par during high-inflation times and it was clear to me that this company didn't value the things that I was particularly good at. It wasn't their fault, they were an older stable company in a low-margin, lower-tech industry (it was a supermarket chain and I worked in IT), and I was particularly strong in learning and adapting newer technologies. I made a decision that was difficult for me at the time, and found a new job with a significant salary increase. Like you, I also turned down a significant offer to stay. I never looked back. Over the years, I've learned that it pays to keep an eye on the market. Even if you are happy in your job, learn what skills companies are looking for. And learn what companies are willing to pay for. That can help guide your actions in the future. Sometimes you'll decide that you need to update your skills on your own. Sometimes you'll decide that you can get what you need within your own company by being a little louder or more proactive. Sometimes you'll decide that you need to move on and find a new job - perhaps in a different sector. 

It's not inappropriate, but it is rather late. After two years, while it may bother you, it almost certainly is forgotten by the manager. Dredging it up after two years may ease your conscience, but probably won't do much for your former manager. If it were me, I'd just find a way to let it go. But if it is still bothering you this much, and you think it will be cathartic to apologize, go for it. 

Have you tried indicating in your profile that you are interested only in positions on the US West Coast? Being direct, and indicating specifically what you are seeking is usually the best way to get what you want. 

If you value honesty, you should love being the only applicant who's being honest. I'm guessing the whole point of the question was to see if you are honest or not. And if a potential employer doesn't value honesty, would you really want to work there anyway? When I ask questions in an interview, not all of them will have flattering answers. I want to hear if a candidate will tell me the truth, try to weasel out of answering, or will just lie. I never hire people who lie - I assume that if they will lie during an interview, they will lie other times as well and some of those times might be important to my company. Just answer his question truthfully. Don't offer explanations unless and until you are asked for them. 

You could quit and find work at a company that doesn't use hoteling. Or you could stick it out and make the best of it that you can. If you choose the latter, some folks try to make such a situation tolerable by: 

If your relationship is good enough, it's simple. You simply say "Hey, boss. You made two whopping mistakes today. First, you sent me your budget for 2014. But more important, [include the details that you think are problematic here]. Just wanted to let you know." If you aren't sure your relationship is good enough, then just ignore it. Respond only if your boss realizes his mistake and asks you about the details in the spreadsheet. Technically, you probably shouldn't have read the details once you realized the spreadsheet wasn't supposed to be delivered to you. Budgets are usually closely checked along the way, so mistakes like these will likely be caught by someone else. He might be embarrassed by those mistakes, but they aren't likely fatal.
