Capital requirements: Banks don't typically need to hold capital against loans they originated but subsequently moved into an SPV. This might be regulatory arbitrage but it might be a socially efficient outcome meant to move assets and liabilities out of the banking system. Market segmentation: Because SPVs can tranche (slice) their loans they can offer products with different assumed default correlations, prepayment risk, and aggregate credit risk. These products can appeal to customers with different beliefs and preferences over risk. Bank business model: Banks may be better at finding customers, screening them, and handling the paperwork of making loans (broadly originating) then they are at proving inexpensive and patient capital to fund those loans. Securitization allows the bank to specialize in origination without also being the ultimate capital provider. Information destruction: Because SPVs contain loans that are diversified over geography and borrower characteristics they can reduce market adverse selection, improving pricing and liquidity. 

(emphasis mine) Another possibility is to consider those sectors, like digital media, where we are already post-scarcity, in that marginal costs are zero or very near to it. I recommend Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian's Information Rules for an accessible and interesting discussion of the economic issues that arise in this setting. 

Who would pay depends on the terms of the default. Sometimes holders of similar debts are not treated equally, and this can play out in different ways. Greeks could default on external debts but continue to pay internal creditors. Or because the ESM and other entities are providing ongoing financing, perhaps they will continue to be repaid when others are not to keep those spigots open. Or, less extremely, they could vary the degree of forbearance, term changes, and extent of default. I found the following two charts from 2013 and 2014 helpful for understanding who are the current holders of Greek public debt and how that compares with other rich countries. 

If X and Y are normal, then the distribution of X conditional on Y is: $$ X | (Y = y) = N(\mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y), (1-\rho)^2 \sigma^2_x )$$ Therefore, $E[X|Y = y] = \mu_x + \rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(y - \mu_y) = (\mu_x - \mu_y (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})) + (\rho \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y})y $ which is linear in $y$. Symmetrically: $$E[Y|X = x] = (\mu_y - \mu_x (\rho \frac{\sigma_y}{\sigma_x})) + (\rho \frac{\sigma_y}{\sigma_x})x $$ which is also linear in $x$ 

Inflation is the percent change in a price index per unit time. You should compound at the same frequency as the units in the inflation measure. Many reported measures of inflation are year over year measures, which means that even though they may be reported monthly or quarterly they overlap substantially between observations. You want to be sure to handle this properly by choosing non-overlapping intervals. 

There are positive externalities as well as negative ones. A good could have both and they could, in principle, sum to zero. In Foobar's bread example, "...the consumption of bread adds carbohydrates to the diet which ensures healthy functioning of workers, athletes, etc. " is not an externality, it is a benefit which is priced. Many goods are taxed or subsidized and if these are equal and opposite to their level of net externality then there is no remaining externality by construction Market failures can be de minimis in the dead weight loss they cause. When it comes to a consumer good, externalities are like taxes, their dead weight losses are (roughly, depends on the functional forms) increasing in the product size of the externality and the elasticity of demand. Therefore, if demand is highly inelastic (like for milk or bread) and the externalities are likely small (again for milk or bread) the total distortion of those externalities is likely quite small. 

Workers may have different skills. If immigrant workers are good at farming then domestic workers can shift into non-farming activities. Workers increase the total population and larger populations can sustain greater specialization. For example, with enough people we can have an artisanal pencil sharpener and professional crossword puzzle maker but a smaller population couldn't sustain that as a career. Migrants tastes may differ from domestics and domestics may develop businesses to address these tastes. For example, bidets are not common in the United States but Kohler, an American toilet manufacturer, is happy to have its workers make them for immigrants that enjoy them. 

When a country loses access to markets they mean access to debt markets. Here is a quote from a paper if you need a citation: 

While gross notional exposures are huge, net exposures at the banks are much smaller, on the order of 0.1 percent of gross exposures. Since most financial risk (but perhaps not operational risk) is proportional to net exposures this is a more sensible measure of total derivative risk at the banks. Since net exposures at the 6 banks with the largest derivative exposures circa 2014 were on the order of \$300 billion while their total assets were more than \$10 trillion, we may not have seen a disaster because the actual risk is appropriate to the scale of their broader operations. Here is an example of how this works. At time 0 a bank does derivative trade with notional of 100 with A and collects the offer (or ask) price. That is, the bank sells the derivative to someone who wants to buy it. At time 1 a bank does derivative trade with B with notional of 100 and collects the bid price. That is, they buy the derivative from someone who wants to sell it. Total (gross) derivative exposure is 200, two derivative contracts each with an exposure of 100. However, net exposure is zero, and the bank keeps the spread as profit for its trouble. There is likely some remaining risk in the form of operations and credit risk, but this is what the spread and initial and variation margin are for. 

Leverage ratios are typical simple ratios of debt to equity while capital adequacy ratios are usually risk weighted. 

I've not see a strict analysis of the top one percent but I have seen an analysis of the top 400 tax payers, the very highest income taxpayers: 

First-differencing is very similar to $Y_t = \alpha + \beta_0 * Y_{t-1} + \beta_1 * X_{t} + \beta_2 * X_{t-1} + \epsilon$ with the additional restrictions that $\beta_0 = 1$ and $\beta_1 = -\beta_2$ First-differencing can introduce serial correlation in standard errors 

Stockholm International Peace Research Institute: Monitoring Military Expenditures But wages are a big part of military costs and those are not paid with PPP GDP but rather domestic GDP. MEASURING HARD POWER: CHINAâ€™S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MILITARY CAPACITY says that both methods have merits but at least in China, both methods understate military capacity. 

This may not be the complete answer but I believe this is a major issue: It is extremely difficult to get famous and rich people to participate in surveys. They have handlers that prevent surveyor access. They have multiple phones numbers and homes that makes it difficult to find them. They also have complex affairs that may make it difficult for them to easily summarize. For example, having a complete picture of sponsorship income can be challenging and almost no one knows what a fair value is for their accumulated pension. In summary, I assume that most of professional athletes are not covered by the BLS survey. Instead, it is people of more modest income, like minor league athletes and golf pros that are actually getting picked up. 

The Origins of the Value of a Statistical Life Concept Maybe that's too much like the two input story of Aerandal. Depends on if you consider the saved lives a "savings" or a "good". For a clearer example of the guns vs. butter tradeoff, consider another example from WW II. 

The easiest way to estimate the total amount of quantitative easing is to look at the change in the balance-sheet of the Federal Reserve because every bit of money put in through quantitative easing involved the purchase of assets which grew the central bank's balance sheet. 

I couldn't say what was the actual explanation but Increased availability of consumer goods could deliver this result. Say people in the USSR expected that eventually there would be a consumer revolution where their choice of goods would be better. Then utility would look like something like this: $$ U(c_1, c_2, c_3) = ln(c_1) + \beta \cdot \xi \cdot ln( c_2) + \beta^2 \cdot \xi \cdot ln( c_3)$$ where $c_i$ is the consumption in period $i$, $\beta$ is the discount rate, and $\xi > 1$ indicates how much better consumption is in time 2 than 1. A higher value of $\xi$, meaning a greater improvement in consumption acts like a higher value of $\beta$, meaning lower discounting of future consumption in period $1$. That means that households will (all else equal) save more in period 1. In period 2 there is no expected increase in the quality of consumption, only the standard time discounting differentiates consumption in the present and future, and so the savings rate (relative to period 1) falls, just as it would if $\beta$ fell. 

If free speech is narrowly defined to only include true claims, true and false claims can be perfectly distinguished, the harm of false claims perfectly measured, and all claims are either true or false, then false claims are really no different than other forms of pollution. A standard pigovian tax should internalize the externalities and encourage the socially optimal level of truth telling. The social planner just has to tax each lie enough to discourage the social harm it does. However, I maintain that in practice all of these assumptions are false. All experience seems to show that using the legal system to purge public discourse of lies leads to concentrating enormous power in those who make the lie / truth determination and that they will use that power in a way that is often inconsistent with objective truth And, when there is no objective truth there will still be those who would use the legal system to control public discourse in the name of protecting it. In addition, the real world's imperfect legal processes are expensive and painful to participate in. That means that many true things that may be confused with lies will not be said, and that will further restrict freedom of speech. 

My understanding is that all the advanced approaches banks disclose their quarterly VaR as part of their Basel II.5 Market Risk Disclosures. I don't know of any databases of this data but you can download it yourself. Examples: Citibank JP Morgan Those banks disclose daily but some (BB&T) instead disclose quarterly. 

So what is different when deposits aren't cash but instead are electronic? Nothing of substance. The bank still has the vast majority of its liabilities invested in illiquid assets, in America usually mortgage and commercial loans. The bank still must pay on demand in cash or electronic bank transfer. If it doesn't have enough electronic cash, it has to find people who will pay cash for their assets or lend against them. I think what confuses @user2832080 is that false assumption that the problem is "how much cash is in the ATMs" when in fact it is "how much cash / deposits in other banks / readily marketable securities the bank can get a hold of on short notice" A bank could be able to give all the money by ATM that people want but still have not nearly enough to pay the electronic transfer requests. A bank could have run out of cash in the ATMs (as happens from time to time around natural disasters) but have plenty of liquidity to pay out transfer requests. All of which may sound odd to the lay reader. I recommend Richard Brown's article: A Simple Explanation of How Money Moves Around the Banking System for a nice overview of how you don't need cash to affect transfers between institutions. The key idea is that banks have cash on hand, they have cash balances at other banks, and a limited amount of marketable liquid assets (like government bonds). If the demands to return deposits exceed those values, the bank is having a run, with or without the lines out front. 

I can think of at least one paper where binding accounting rules are shown to have negative consequences on real investment: Can Tight Accounting Oversight Distort Investment? Evidence from Mortgage Restructurings after the JOBS Act 

The FRB has published discount window lending activity since 2010. Though this data is published with a two year lag, it may be of use. You can download that data at from their website at the link above. There is price discrimination at the window: 

Forecasting with Mixed Frequencies by Michelle T. Armesto, Kristie M. Engemann, and Michael T. Owyang has a nice overview of several mixed frequency prediction techniques (including MIDAS) and evaluates them on several macroeconomic series:
