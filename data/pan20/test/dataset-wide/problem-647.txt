For the most extreme conditions he'd want something like the Pugsley. For less extreme conditions any "mountain" bike should work fine. In a way, the trailer is probably less critical than the bike. So long as the tires are large enough in diameter to not get caught in potholes, and so long as they are sufficiently wide to not sink into the soil (given whatever load they carry), a decent trailer will follow along behind fairly nicely. It's mostly a question of finding something durable enough for the duty. 

I know a little of what you describe since I do an annual tour (coming up real soon now) and I always feel "off" for a few weeks after. I suspect that the problem is more with hormones and neurotransmitters than with physical fitness. The body adjusts hormones based on steady power output all day, and when that degree of power production drops (even though you're still quite active) the hormones go whacko. And there's also a sort of lack of motivation, of course, since the tour's over and it's back to the same old grind. Motivation has a lot to do with how much effort you can put out. 

If you're getting knee-deep floods it's destroying the bearings along with the chain. You need to hang the bike up somehow. 

The chain is actually shifting from one sprocket to another. The chain is slipping on the sprocket, without shifting to another sprocket. 

Three feet just seems (to legislators) like a reasonable number (it's 1 meter in the UK and I think most of Europe). And I know it's the law in Minnesota. Don't know about any other states. Would a different number make more sense? Probably not. Less would be out-and-out dangerous, and more would create the situation where the bike (in theory) blocks traffic in too many cases (and hence would be ignored even more than the current law). 

Yeah, talcum powder is what you want -- it has a natural slipperiness like graphite. Though cornstarch or any other powder would work fairly well. (Graphite would be OK but it's rather messy.) It's especially good to use after making a patch, since the patch has a strong tendency to stick to the inside of the tire. You used to be able to buy it packaged specifically for use in bike tires, though I haven't seen it in a bike shop in years. (You clean your tires???) 

Generally when new there is room for about half a ball additional in the bearing race, but very quickly wear of the cup makes it look like a ball is missing. And a ball bearing assembly can function reasonably well with 2-3 balls actually missing (though this will cause faster wear). The usual technique, when you don't know for sure if any balls have been lost (or how many) is to go for "full minus one" -- enough balls to fill the race, then take one out. The balls are cheap and any decent bike shop will have them. (Take a ball or two with you for the shop to measure.) If you replace any balls, though, replace all of them, since the old ones will be worn and not have exactly the same diameter. (And always get 2-3 more than you need, since you'll always drop one or two and not be able to find them.) I've found that normally there is an odd number of balls -- 9 or 11, eg. But there's no theoretical basis for this rule. To use cartridge bearings you'd have to replace the hubs, or at the very least get a machine shop to machine the hubs to accept the cartridges (thought there's likely not enough "meat" to allow this). I've had cartridge hubs in the past and they're not necessarily trouble-free. Cartridges were "the in thing" back maybe 1985, but now you only see them in cranks (where there is room to place a cartridge with no compromises). But if you want cartridge hubs, I believe Phil Woods is still the go-to company to get them (or was last I checked). (And note that the cartridge hubs will not look like standard hubs.) 

The derailer is bent. The derailer is gummed up, has mud in it, or is otherwise being prevented from moving. (You said the cable has been completely loosened, right?) The limit screws are misadjusted It's the wrong derailer for that gear setup. Eg, a double derailer on a triple crank. 

The cold won't hurt it -- foam is used to line refrigerators. And certainly if the temp is going "all the way down" to 40F (shudder!) that's not even close to a problem -- around here it isn't even "cold" unless the temp is below zero F. (In general, solid objects are not damaged by cold, though they do often become more brittle while cold and hence more apt to be damaged while in that state.) High temps could be a problem, but again foam (very similar to the stuff used in helmets) is used to insulate homes, where attic temps may reach 150F or so, and it's used to insulate water heaters that run at 180F. The problem is that extended high temps over, say, 150F, won't degrade the rigid foam itself, but they will degrade the glues and the foam rubber liner. 

Make sure that the cable is tight enough so that the brake levers do not "bottom out" when you squeeze them. When squeezed as tightly as possible the levers should still not bottom out. Clean the brake pads and the rim face. Use soap and water, then wipe with rubbing alcohol. Get some fine sandpaper, slide it between rim and pad, facing the pad, squeeze the brakes gently, and work the sandpaper (turning the wheel slightly) to sand any glaze/grease off the pads. Double check that the brake levers and the brake arms are "made for each other". If someone replaced the caliper brake levers with V brake levers, eg, then the force ratios would be way off. 

Yeah, it's a touchy situation. Some won't mind it at all, some won't notice (and will therefore make hazardous moves), some will silently seethe, and some will get downright nasty. When I was a regular commuter I would draft occasionally when the cyclist ahead of me was obviously a skilled one (ie, all the right clothes, fancy bike, etc) -- though, to be honest, in most of those cases I couldn't keep up anyway. I wouldn't usually draft someone in street clothes on their Huffy (even though I could keep up with those). On organized rides I'm a little more likely to take advantage of drafting, though one must be careful there since often riders in a group behave dumbly as they chit-chat. (And I'll admit that I lower my standards a fair amount in a strong headwind.) [I'll add that I'm talking here about drafting on straight bike trails and lightly-traveled rural roads. Drafting in heavy traffic or in a "downtown" road layout is ill-advised at best.] 

It used to be easier to tell BSOs from "real" bikes, but now the technology is changing so rapidly, and it's much harder. On a bike older than about 20 years, one would first look at the frame, in two places: 

Of course, a smaller bike, with 24" wheels, say, or even 26" would be proportionally lighter, and a little less awkward to handle on stairs. And there are other ways to make some headway in terms of weight and awkwardness on the stairs. Eg: full-sized fenders are more awkward than shorties, and front fenders tend to be especially awkward, so you may want to look at options there. You could, for instance, rotate the entire fender forward (rotating the stays up) enough to get the "tail" just above the toe clearance area (added benefit), then trim off the front just maybe 3 inches beyond the fork. You'd cut a little bit of weight and have much less fender in the way when handling it. A small bungee cord can be wrapped between the front wheel and the down tube, to keep the front wheel straight while handling. The heavy lock can be left locked in place at the other end of the ride, or can be locked in a convenient place near the bottom of the stairs. The style of rack can make a difference in weight and awkwardness. A rack need not be large and heavy to handle a substantial load. Pick a rack that is fairly compact, and make sure it's so solidly mounted that one can confidently lift the bike via the rack, rather than having to work around it. You may want to get a shoulder pad, or just a piece of foam pipe insulation slipped over the top bar, to let her carry the bike on her shoulder. (This may or may not be easier for her handling the bike.)
