Try as much as possible to act as an enabler for your team to produce high quality code. They will appreciate the respect this entails 

Put it to your team that some coding standards are needed. You can probably find some guidelines online to use as a starting point. Ask your team to give feedback on this, and allow them to add practices that they know to be good from their own experience. Set up a meeting to go through your draft guidelines and finalise it. There will certainly be some things that are controversial, and you'll need to allow sufficient discussion, but then close down on a decision. Even if a decision goes against something that one of the devs holds dear, they'll have the consolation that they were consulted and that a rational discussion took place. Get the team to do code reviews. Ideally this is not a hierarchical thing, but one team member helping the other to stick to the standards, and maybe making suggestions for design improvements. You can also consider pair programming, but many teams do fine without it. 

I am currently leaving my job. I have a short period of notice and I've put my employer in a uncomfortable spot. When I did this, he quickly asked me if I had a reference for him. Refering someone for an interview, especially if it's a good fit, is something generally apreciated by employers and ease the tensions. It is possible your employer is so angry that he may react irrationally (you have to figure this out) but most likely he will end up respecting your decision and accept that you help him to find a replacement. 

As others answer provided, there is no such thing as being unprofessional for checking the documentation especially considering you are junior, especially considering programming is vast and there is always a detail you can forget and you have a mission for your code to be correct. There is however cases I would consider being documentation abuses. I have a collegue who is sometimes unable to come up with his own solution about a given problem. Therefore, he sometimes proceed on checking the web about how to solve his problem. Last time, for example, he checked how a web framework was architecturing validators and error counters because he had a seemingly similar feature to design. This is a case where what you are looking for is far too abstract for the Internet to help you. Worse, you could find solutions that seemingly fit, but in fact don't, because they are applied to a different use case. By trying to grab some premade code/architecture/pattern he would have more or less injected code in our base that may have worked, but would be hard to maintain because written by someone else for a different purpose. I don't look the documentation often because I write code that uses mostly core language features (no framework) and I am gifted with a reliable memory when it comes to code, but I do use the doc everytime I'm stuck on something trivial. However, if I'm stuck on something higher level, the good thing to do is to seek help from a more experienced collegue, you will get a much better answer. 

The amount of effort it takes to transform a room to a fairy princess place, or whatever, is a way of showing how much affection and respect there is for the colleague that is on the receiving end of this. People are saying: "We value your companionship as a colleague enough to waste our own resources, and some company resources, to do something special for you." When this happens, enjoy the moment, and look forward to the occasion when your colleagues play an elaborate prank on you - on the first of April, or any other day. 

It may be that he really doesn't have the cash to pay you what he owes, and would have a hard time raising it. If this is true, you could perhaps come to a deal about an alternative form of recompense. For example, if he is genuine, and acknowledges the debt, one way out of the problem would be to offer you shares in the company instead. Of course, any entrepreneur will see the equity in their company as the way they are building up their future, and therefore valuable, and on the other hand, the shares might well be worthless - that's a judgement you'd have to make. Mostly, my point is that there are other ways than cash to settle a debt. If he isn't willing to at least consider alternatives, then it really brings the friendship into doubt. If you're genuinely looking for a solution that works for both of you, he must do the same, or he is not your friend. 

First off, this seems like a joke that was put into code that they are well aware will not be used for anything or read ever again. I think you are reading far too much into this incident. The important thing is that you told them about the naming convention and they did not ignore you, they did use longer and more descriptive names (albeit sarcastically). After watching this video: $URL$ I can see that workers desire 3 things. 

In your situation it might be wise to mention to Company A that you would rather work for them, but since your family lives cross country, and Company B is offering more PTO you are unsure of what to do. You can ask if there is any way that they could match that time. 

I think a better approach would be looking at what you can control to rectify the situation of your boss being upset when the employees are missing meetings. 

You could be on time to meetings, which seems obvious but would eliminate this problem. If you feel that everyone truly needs a reminder then you could remind the people in your office to be on time. 

"Selling oneself cheap" is only negative to some employers, not all, especially considering they are the ones to pay. On the positive side of things, showing it hints that the applicant is someone that like to help and get jobs done, has a business sense, don't overvalue his time, and appreciate his field of work. I think it will be viewed as a positive thing applying for a subordinate position, but might look odd applying for a more executive position where it can be regarded as a lack of self-esteem. 

I'd say in case you are accepted, just respect legal period of notice and politely say goodbye to your old team. It's never easy to quit a job in this situation, but it's part of a company life to handle turnover. I was in the exact same situation few weeks ago : working in a small team, quitting, lots of planned work etc. but they found a promising replacement even though they had high expectations (finding quickly a cheap autonomous dev ready to work overtime). It's advisable to finish in good terms, by extending the notice period as much as your next employer would accept and/or suggesting a competent replacement if you know any, but thinking about yourself is higher priority. The company will recover. Good luck for the interview ! 

"Nominated for a promotion" isn't worth the breath it takes to say it. Ok - sure - it's a nice thing to be told, but if you're taking a hard-headed look at your business relationship with your employer it means almost nothing. Even more seriously "resistance from HR given some circumstances we can't control" translates directly to "I want to appear nice, and have you stay even though you should be promoted, so I'll blame some mysterious thing over at HR". Take the interview - give it your best. You're not wasting their time, you are giving them the opportunity to recruit you. You haven't decided yet whether to stay or go. You never know, once you look more closely, the other job might be more attractive than getting the promotion would be. 

You say that you have "done all without complaining", but perhaps you should be giving some sort of feedback. It doesn't have to be a "complaint", but it's reasonable to discuss your assignments and progress with your manager. Perhaps they have a plan, which includes having you learn to do simple tasks. "Trivial" is perhaps not the best word to choose, because even simple tasks need to be done well, and can be important. Your role as an intern is not just to accept everything unquestioningly. It's fair for you to ask for a clear road map of what progress you will be expected to make in the coming period, and how your current work contributes to this. It's not just about the technical tasks. While you are an intern, it's very important that you make a start on developing the interpersonal skills that will make you successful in the workplace. So take some time to plan how you will present your questions to your manager. Think about what you want to achieve, what you think is reasonable to ask for, and how you will put this across in a way that shows that you are thinking and acting as a professional. Usually, being willing to take some initiative in your own development will be seen as a positive thing. Just make sure that's what you're doing. 

"Needs more experience" is a convenient and nice way to say "did not get the job". You then had a conversation with one of the other people that worked for that organization and got along well, which changed the how they perceived you as a job candidate. This new perception fits with someone that they want to hire. It seems like you are taking the first rejection as a personal slight directly from the HR manager but they was almost certainly not the only one to make that decision. Perceptions change, and thus decisions change. If you want the job you should reapply for the job under these new circumstances. 

As far as whether you should expect your boss to lower his expectations on punctuality I would say absolutely not. You are all adults and should be doing your jobs, and in this case that means being on time to meetings. I apologize for the repetition, but as far as I can tell the way forward is clear. Be on time to meetings 

Same thing goes for more operational roles. You understimate the satisfaction you can get out of tech roles probably because you had bad experience with them, but they are full of interesting challenges. Now, that doesn't mean you should be a tech, it really depends of your own ability at it and what would be your ideal career plan. In my opinion, you should avoid dead ends, not because of the pay, but simply because it's better to have options to change your job if get bored (and this is very likely to happen IMHO) than seeking the perfect job right on start. 

I had the same issue when building my CV, and solved it using a "speciality" line. Typically, your job title would look like 

I would avoid to put "senior" in the title as this is covered by experience, and doesn't explain what is the profession of the candidate. 

I don't think it is a very important fact for them to know, so I wouldn't mention it. Either they already know that fact because they remember you as a potential recruit, either they don't and recalling them you applied several times may make them think they had reasons not to hire you before. Instead, use your knowledge of the company for a good, targetted cover letter. Insist on your motivation and explain why you applied several times before. 

What you are asking them to do is not autonomous, is probably of trivial difficulty for some of them, and serves no purpose in their eyes. Fix the assignment, and the workers will follow. Some examples: 

Obviously inserting bugs to deceive your employer is wrong. I understand your hesitation about being laid off which is why I would suggest letting them know that you finish the work in a fraction of the time that they think you need and therefore you can take on more responsibility. Unless they ask, I see no reason for you to mention that you automated it, and even less of a reason for you to send your scripts to anyone else. The company would be paying for someone to do this job 40hrs/wk without you, I see your ability to automate and maintain tasks as an opportunity to increase your worth to the company as opposed to a reason you would be laid off. 

If it is a public company I would suggest looking at their tax information. Notably the most recent 10k form. It should have information on budgets and money allocation at the very least.
