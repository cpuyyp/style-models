The better way to think about the situation is simply that the trip will go by more quickly. A human sitting on Earth has to wait 8.5 years for a light signal to make a round trip from Earth to Proxima Centauri and back, but a space traveler travelling at 0.95c (as measured by the people on Earth as you leave and return) will make the round trip in merely 2.7 years, as measured by their own clock. A noticeable difference in elapsed time to be sure, but it's not even an order of magnitude in effect. 

If you sell these coins to various merchants, then unless they have a direct use for them, those merchants will need to find a way to sell the coins to others. They'll probably just say that they bought them off of a customer. Come to think of it, you're effectively one of those merchants. Just tell the truth: you traded for them off of a traveler who didn't have anything else to pay with at the time, since it seemed like a good deal, and they'd make a nice souvenir even if they turned out not to be real gold. Or whatever other fluff you like that is ideally true, but still emphasizes that you aren't the go-to guy for this stuff. 

Organized religion around a malevolent god of murder would happen because malevolent people congregate, and would idolize powerful beings that share their values. 

Alternatively, we have sufficiently analyzed magic, but we still call it magic as an homage to the origins of the field — for example, I believe the term "atom" is a reference to the ancient Democritus's atomic theory of the universe. 

Because the laws are too simplistic and naïve "Robot apocalypse" is about valuations being taken to extremes; e.g. the paperclip maximizer only being 'taught' about optimizing a paperclip factory, but being allowed to operate arbitrarily beyond that scope, and thus consumes all resources (including humans) for the sake of making paper clips. Even "don't harm humans" is fraught with problems when taken as an inviolate law: 

Your ship runs fine Everything on board your ship operates exactly as it always does; there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary going on. You don't even look that unusual to the people you pass by. Despite the popular description, time dilation isn't really that "things slow down". Instead, time dilation is about the fact that when people take divergent trips and then meet back up, their watches don't agree. Time dilation is an obstacle to synchronizing distant clocks. The usual idea of time dilation is really about a single POV deciding upon a convention for a universal time standard (there is no physical basis for such a standard). If they are sufficiently inertial, then by this specific standard, that person's clocks will run faster than anyone else's. But any other person can establish the same convention with them at the center instead, and (if they're sufficiently inertial) it's their clocks that run the fastest. 

Don't reject the villain route too quickly — if you can set yourself up for a dramatic Heel-Face Turn, you have a good shot at making the main cast. The tricky part is avoiding Redemption Equals Death. This gambit works especially well if you're an attractive female. 

Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science. Magic obeys the laws of nature and nature obeys the laws of magic because they are the same thing. We would call some aspect of reality "magic" because its roots and practice are steeped in mysticism and we have not yet sufficiently analyzed it. For example, I believe it would be accurate to label real world alchemy as a branch of magic going through the final stages of being sufficiently analyzed to produce the field of chemistry. In a story, the reason we would still have magic in a scientific world is because it has somehow resisted analysis. e.g. 

No need for a sun to travel in a straight line; each sun simply travels along a gigantic circle at some fixed (gigantic) altitude. You could then get a variety of effects by having suns move at different speeds, different length orbits, the orbits drift or wobble around, the altitude varies. An interesting, novel variation on seasons is a region that sees two suns of slightly different orbital periods. During the the mild season, the suns are completely out of sync; each "day" has two periods of light and dark and mild temperatures, and weak winds. During the intermediate seasons, the suns are only partially out of sync; the second sun comes along in the wake of the first, leading to each "day" consisting of one long day period and one long night period. During the stormy season, the suns are completely in sync; each "day" consists of a short, intensely hot period while both suns are blazing, a short, extremely dark period, and long twilight hours that suffer strong storms as the hot, moist air beneath the suns blows into the colder regions. 

Smaller Cross-section If your ship is long in the direction of travel and narrow in other directions, it means your ship presents a smaller cross section along its direction of travel. Some advantages include: 

Politics As the owner of one of the most popular shops in Monte Lacum, you should be able to drum up some influence (and some wealth) to address the issue of rampant crime. Mobilize the merchants guild, and find a sympathetic ear among relevant town officials. Put on the pressure to get the town guard into shape and properly protect the merchant quarter. Or other, seedier things, like turning popular opinion against ice mages and getting them drummed out of town, or striking a deal with the thieves guild for protection. 

Time travel is powerful. So powerful that you don't want those other guys to have access to it. So you use time travel to get rid of them. (unless, of course, they get rid of you first) The timeline can only sustain, at most, one time traveler, and he's not sharing. (credit for the basic idea goes to Erfworld fanon, regarding the magic school of retconjuration) 

Mages don't like competition. The current mages only tolerate each other because each is powerful enough to protect himself from the others on his own turf, and there is an uneasy game of politicking and one-upsmanship to fight for influence (and more crystals!) without risking open war (which would then leave the winner vulnerable to any of the neutral parties). The one thing they can all agree on is that they don't need any new upstarts around to make competition even fiercer, or worse risk destabilizing the delicate balance that exists — consequently, only those ruthless enough to avoid detection and survive assassination or hungry enough for power to make the desperate attempt dare try to become a mage. 

Here's a simple way you could have mounted cavalry in the modern area: it's the traditional way to build your armies and your world hasn't yet gone through a war that would demonstrate how bad of an idea it is. Your major powers can and will continue to use cavalry against the lesser powers who don't have the resources to develop the new technology that would render cavalry obsolete, the foresight to invest in these new, speculative methods of warfare, or the competence to effectively deploy them. I think the main thing you just need is to prevent the occurrence of a war between major powers that can decisively defeat cavalry, so that the conservative military leaders can continue to remain hesitant about getting rid of their tried and true mounted forces in favor of the new, speculative military doctrine. 

The usual argument that "FTL implies time travel" is based on special relativity (SR). A crucial assumption is that whatever physics governs FTL still obeys the symmetries of SR — in particular, if you can travel at some coordinate velocity in one inertial reference frame (as defined by SR), then you can travel at that velocity in all inertial reference frames. The way to defeat the argument is simple: don't require FTL to obey the symmetries of SR. This shouldn't be troublesome to do, since you have already broken the laws of SR simply by assuming tardyonic matter (i.e. you) can be accelerated to be faster than light. So you pick out a comfortable Newtonian reference frame, explain that it turns out length contraction and time dilation really is the right way to think about things after all (which is convincing, since the "absolute" rest frame is something we can now detect through whatever physics govern FTL), and enjoy FTL without time travel. The real problem is why you don't blow up the universe with an optic boom. 

Another possibility is that magic is the provenance of supernatural beings; that natural beings cannot perform magic at all, but they can bargain with supernatural beings to perform magic on their behalf. (e.g. an AI in a computer program chatting with the programmer to request that he enact some change in the game world) Of course, the supernatural world is just the natural world viewed from a greater perspective; this really only applies when there is some meaningful division to be made. 

Given this design, there are also advantages to having your ship taper off at both ends: it means a greater volume of your ship is adjacent to the forward-facing or rear-facing hull. For example, this may mean you can mount a much bigger forward-facing laser cannon or deflector array or whatnot. 

Malicious intent If you have an infectious disease, you can transmit it. And (depending on availability, ease of deliberate transmission, and traceability of such actions) there will be people who will go out of the way to be able to do so.
