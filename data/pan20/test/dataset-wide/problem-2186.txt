It makes sense for you to complete the project first as you are suggesting. But once the project is complete, there's no real need to wait at all. If the consulting company has agreements not to poach employees from your company, you might want to wait at least a few months after they are no longer working with your company. 

Take him out to lunch. Talk about his "last strike". Ask if he cares or is just cruising along hoping to get fired. If he cares, ask if he has any idea why get often gets distracted. It could be anything ranging from boredom to a medical issue. Ask if he wants help. If he does, offer to tell him to "Get back to work!" whenever you catch him slacking off. Sometimes friendly reminders can help us keep on track when trying to break bad habits. Ask if he can think of anything else that you could do to help keep him from slacking. Keeping him an active participant in the process is important - real change comes only from within and only when folks really want to change. You cannot impose that on him from without. If he truly respects your advice, he'll listen thoughtfully and open up a bit. Sometimes just having a sounding board like you can help. 

It's too soon. Wait until late November, then connect with the HR manager. At that time, let her know of your continued interested, that you are still excited about the possibility of joining them, your anticipated date of graduation, and the enhancements to your skills that have occurred since you last spoke. And remember to ask them what will be the next step in the process, so you'll know when to contact them yet again. Meanwhile, continue to seek out other jobs. This one isn't guaranteed. 

Anything is possible, but it seems unlikely that your current company will give you more money after less than a month of work because of a threat to leave. More likely will that be they'll just tell you to go now. When I interview people, I tend to avoid job-hoppers. There's always another offer out there, for a bit more. I like to hire for the long term. If I think the candidate is jumping around repeatedly trying to get a few dollars more, I wont hire them, as I suspect they'll leave as soon as they find the next job paying a little more. In your case, your timing was off. If you show your current employer that you are a job-hopper, they might give you more money. But more likely is that they'll just say goodbye. 

It's truthful, and not misleading. And if a recruiter were of a mind to consider candidates who had some studies, but no degree, then you might meet the requirements. 

It depends on the goals of the meeting. If it's a brainstorming meeting, then it's usually most desirable to generate many alternatives quickly before trying to judge their worth. In this case you wouldn't be wasting time. If you are being asked to come up with alternatives without regard to your recommendations, then your reply wouldn't reflect badly on you. If you think your suggestions might be viable, but you need the group's input to reach your recommendation, then your approach is reasonable. But if this is an urgent "what should we do about this problem" sort of meeting, it seems to be implied that you are being asked for your recommendations. In that case, generating a bunch of alternatives that you wouldn't recommend might be considered a waste of time. Additionally, consider your role in the meeting. If you are the team leader, then you might be tossing out a bunch of ideas soliciting feedback from your team. But if you are the sole technical expert for a technical question, then it may be implied that your specific recommendation is being solicited, not get a list of possibilities. And it also depends on the overall viability of your solution. Tossing out solutions like "first we boil the ocean (not that I'm recommending that, I'm just throwing it out there)" isn't likely to be received well. Context is everything in meetings. 

In my opinion, the best way to deal with it is to learn not to base your morale on the actions of others. Take pride in your work. Feel good about the compensation you received. Learn to ignore what others do or don't do. Presumably you felt good about yourself, your work and your compensation before this Bob appeared. And likely you will feel good again once the incompetant is let go. Meanwhile, essentially nothing about you has changed but your attitude. You have chosen to let another's poor performance affect you. Stop comparing yourself to others. Work hard each day, and take pleasure in the work you do. When I was very young, I used to feel the way you do. I've learned to get past that. For me this was part of my maturing process. 

First you need to decide if you are offering yourself to the highest bidder or not. If you are, then you can present the details of the offer you are planning to accept (or at least the relevant details), then tell the recruiter "If you can beat that, I'll join your company." If you are not up for bidding, then there is no requirement on your part to tell this recruiter anything other than "Thank you for your consideration, but I've decided not to accept your company's offer." You might choose to indicate that you have decided to stay at your current company and not include any of their offer details. 

I wouldn't attempt to define any company's culture without knowing a lot more about it than this one incident. It could be the norm, or it could be an isolated incident. And I'd need to learn a lot more to determine the why this incident happened the way it did. I've worked for many companies that had deadlines imposed from outside the development team. Sometimes that was due to promises made to an important customer in order to make a sale. Sometimes that was due to regulatory changes that must be met. Sometimes that was due to stupid sales people and/or stupid upper management. In one case, the deadline had to be met in order to allow the company to stay in business. 

The traditional method would be to provide regular reports listing your activities, and tracking them through leads and eventually sales. But from your prior questions, it appears very unlikely that this will get what you think you deserve. You wrote: "the idea is to use my contacts to help the company grow, and be rewarded in turn". That seems to be your idea. But it doesn't seem to be shared by your company. It seems that your vision for your role differs from that of your company. I suspect the company knows exactly what you are doing, but isn't willing to give you the "credit" you feel is due. This isn't about "being transparent". It's about your lack of a formal sales plan that gives you compensation for generating leads. You should push for a formal compensation package that meets your needs. But be prepared to leave if you don't get it. 

Sure, you can always counter-offer. You could also try to stall them with something like "Well, that seems close, but first I have to find out more about the company and position before I can make a decision." And you could always indicate that the salary is acceptable, then change you mind when you find out more about the position. None of this will likely work. Most likely, the company set up this foolish "require a salary acceptance before the interview process is done" system to avoid thoughtful counter-offers. It depends on how acceptable their offer is, and how much you value this job. For me, this is a big red flag that this is a company I'd likely avoid. 

I suspect you are worrying unnecessarily. Only time will tell for sure. Worrying about it now and asking around your first days won't help or change anything. Try to put it out of your mind and assume it's just an inconsequential coincidence. You want to go into your new job with all of your positive energy concentrated on starting off well. 

Let me see if I understand. Overall, you did poorly in school. But you want to include a single semester because you did okay in CS during that semester, but omit the rest. You want to do this so you can intentionally mislead the reader regarding your educational performance. Do I have that right? If so, this is a very bad idea. Leave your education off of your resume completely, if you like, since you didn't graduate. With five years of experience, your education is far less important than it would be if you were entry-level. Be prepared to discuss any gap years and to come up with an answer if asked about education during an interview or a background check. 

If asked, you should be honest and explain to the interviewer that you drew no pay most of the time. This is perfectly reasonable. Explaining how you were trying to launch a product and company will help the interviewer understand. 

No. Since the only one who will ever know the titles of all the positions you declined is you, it won't hurt your career. 

I always feel more comfortable writing more informally. It sounds like you feel that way as well. While some settings call for more "third person" narratives - like conference speakers' bios, authors' bios, etc - those are often written by a marketing person (a true "third person"). On your own sites, and on sites like LinkedIn, etc, you do the actual writing. So my feeling is that you should write in whatever style is most comfortable for you. 

In a larger organization, the answer might be different. But in small businesses like these, you are typically subject to the owner's choices. If it's not really that important to you (and that's the way it seems based on what you wrote), you are probably best off by just ignoring it. Nobody will assume that you support this candidate just because the company owner does. As long as you aren't forced to contribute to the candidate, stuff envelopes, or make phone calls on the candidate's behalf or such, it doesn't seem like much of an invasion. If you feel strongly enough, and your boss is the company owner, you could bring it up. But don't expect the owner to take the sign down because you don't approve - it's her/his business, not yours. If this is something you simply cannot tolerate, you may to find an employer whose political views match yours. My wife works for a 6-person office. The political views of her boss and my wife are pretty much opposite. She has learned to mostly avoid political talk in the office. When her boss and another co-worker start talking about politics, she just leaves the room. I suppose you can always put an opposing candidate's bumper sticker on your car and park it so that the sticker is visible. 

Laugh, be part of the April 1 fun, then plan your "revenge" for next year. Some offices have a culture of fun, and this sort of prank is perfectly appropriate. If your office is like that, the best thing is to go along with what appears like good, clean fun. I've worked in companies like this before, and enjoyed it a lot. I miss those days. 

You already wrote exactly what you should tell him. "[Sorry, but] unfortunately [you] did not have the skills we were seeking." Keep it short, simple, and to the point. Nothing more. 

In general, companies do want to limit access to employees' financial information. Clearly though there are roles and projects that require such access. It sounds like this is one of them. If your job is analytics and the task you have been assigned involves accessing other employee's financial information, you can think what you like but still have to do what you are told. You could (and probably should) ask that you be given a dataset with the individual employees' names and identifiers redacted. That way you'll be analyzing the data without involving individuals. You'll know the what without knowing the who. 

If you are truly at the top of your particular technical ladder, yet wish to stay in your technical position, then you might need to consider other variables. Perhaps you might need to seek very large companies. Sometimes their ladder goes higher. Or you might consider changing locales. Top pay varies by country/region. Or you may just be maxed out, and might have to settle for smaller raises over time. 

Just ask. Something like "Hey, boss. You asked me to complete it. Do you want me to do a quick edit too? I think I spotted a few typos and such." should work. If he says "No", then just do what you have been directed to do. 

As always, it depends. It depends on the manager. If you went to the same school as the hiring manager, that's probably a good thing. If you didn't go to the same school it probably doesn't matter much. It depends on the domain in which you want to work. If you are applying for a position at one of the top law firms, you most likely need to have graduated from a top law school. If you are looking for a low-level business job, your school may not matter much. In many cases, assuming it's an accredited school, it won't matter much at all. 

You listed all the reasons why you were leaving, and none of them indicated "salary". Now the counter offer is to increase your salary, and even with that you don't seem to have come to a salary you really want. Everything else is just hope and pray. I'm not sure why you are hesitant at all. Nothing has really changed except a bit more salary. The answer seems obvious: Leave, and don't look back. 

It sounds like the situation has changed on the informal supervisory relationship. You never really had any formal authority, so it's hard to say that it has been undermined. A year ago there were only two of you in the office. Then your company hired a third person, but you weren't actually put in charge. The new person needed help coming up to speed, and you were tasked with helping. Now (a year later) you are seeing that person is no longer new, and your informal supervision is no longer needed. You seem to be feeling hurt that your boss appears closer to the new employee than to you, even though you admit that you and your boss didn't like each other too much. There's nothing to fix here other than your feelings about work. You need to come to grips with the fact that office dynamics change over time. You could talk with your boss, explain how you are feeling, and clarify your relationship with your boss and with the third employee. And if you still feel that your role isn't what you would like it to be and that it won't improve - then you can decide to leave. 

In order to fix the bugs, you need to understand the system. (Or at least you should understand the system.) In order to understand the system, you need to spend time. You deserve compensation for that time. You need to carefully craft your estimate/contract so that both you and the client understand these assumptions, and come to a mutual agreement on the compensation. You need to do this before you start working. 

When I leave, I send a goodbye email on the afternoon of my last day. Since I've already gone around and said goodbye in person to the folks I care most about, I just use the email to publicly say thanks and to make sure everyone has my personal contact information. It also serves to say goodbye to the remote folks I work with, but can't talk to face-to-face. 

Unfortunately, that's possible - particularly if you don't take action. It may also be that your special circumstances make you less than a good fit for the team's needs at this time. Some companies want to sell Malibus, rather than BMWs. Hopefully, you discussed your learning/cognitive issues during the interview process, it isn't a surprise to your boss, and once you are over the initial hurdles, things will improve. Good luck! (On a side note, I don't have special needs and I'm not a doctor. But I'd urge you to at least talk with a mental health care professional so that you can get a proper diagnosis. These aren't the sorts of things that you can really self-diagnose. At least in the US, there are many groups (like $URL$ offering training, support and help for people with special needs - but it's hard to know which group to turn to unless you first know what (if any) condition you actually have.) 

One thing to learn is that everything is negotiable! You can ask for anything at all while you are negotiating. Some of the things you ask for might be easy to obtain, others might be extremely difficult. Be aware though, that it is often difficult for a hiring manager to go outside the hiring guidelines that are normal in that company. Sometimes, the hiring manager would need to get approval from several levels of management - and that can be difficult to obtain. Since you have already interned at this company, do you happen to know if the 30% tuition reimbursement is the company standard? I know in most of the companies where I have worked, it was far easier for me to offer a bit more in salary than to offer something outside the standard benefits. Do you think the hiring company would agree that obtaining a Masters degree would actually make you a far more valuable employee? One way to determine an answer would be to look at their job postings and see what emphasis they place on advanced degrees. Knowing the answer to this question gives you a sense of the kind of leverage you would have in negotiations. Be prepared for the hiring manager to say "no". Don't take it personally, that's just part of negotiating. And decide beforehand what your response will be either way. Perhaps this is an extremely important factor, and perhaps you know that other companies will give you salary or tuition reimbursement to cover your tuition, or perhaps not. Good luck in your negotiations, and in your continued education.
