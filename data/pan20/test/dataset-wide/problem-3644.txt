The energy systems work like three dimmer switches. When you're doing something like an endurance sport, i.e. marathon running, you'll switch to oxidative, which will use fat as an energy source. When you're just sprinting or Olympic lifting, you'll use the ATP-PC pathway, which uses carbs. However, you never just turn off one. You'll always use all three-just to differing degrees. Fats, carbs, and proteins can also fuel each pathway. Now, the critical thing to note here, is that we are not machines. Your body does not burn just fat, or just protein. These energy systems all work at the same time. It's more of a question of what you are doing and for how long that dictates what source of energy your body needs to burn first. The reason your body will cease to build and repair muscle in a caloric deficit environment is because it needs to save those energy sources over a longer period of time. It's primary job is survival first-and if it's not receiving enough calories, it will hang onto energy stores for later metabolism, vs just repair. Building and repairing muscles costs calories, and the processes for repair are semi-unrelated to metabolism (for the sake of this answer anyway), or your day-to-day activities. So for your questions, TL,DR: 

Anaroebic training does have a positive effect on VO2, or oxygen consumption. The body adapts in this way for a few reasons. Firstly, intravascular pressure increases during heavy lifts, like when performing squats. Because you have to hold your breath (pretty much) and engage your core, your cardiovascular system responds by increasing blood pressure and increasing the force of the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. This results in hypertrophy of the walls of the heart. The official condition is called athlete's heart. This can be bad when extreme (poor electrical conduction of the heart) but problems are rare for most. It's natural and beneficial for most-only a problem if you have a defect or dangerously high cholesterol levels. Your body responds to aerobic training in a similar manner, although the hypertrophy of the heart isn't as drastic (more likely with sprinters or short distance runners). Now both types of athletes' bodies have adapted to the overload being placed on the body-it's just a question of how much, and what systems are responding more. Is that lifter going to be as good as that runner at running a 5K, if all he does is lift? No. But he'll certainly be better off than someone who doesn't exercise at all. Conversely, that runner isn't going to be able to lift as much, but he'll certainly be better off (cardiovascularly speaking anyway) than a beginning athlete. Keep in mind that I'm limiting the answer to just the cardiovascular system adaptations for simplicity's sake. There's always more going on! I should finish off by saying that one must consider what "high endurance" really means. High endurance to a lifter is much different than high endurance to a marathon runner. Remember that our energy systems were built to allow for long distance running (aerobic glycolysis, sweating)-the limitations lie in not knowing where your lactate threshold is (in other words, knowing how to pace yourself), and mechanical inefficiencies (bad form, poor musculoskeletal structure, lack of nutrients). Anybody can run for miles if they know how to pace themselves and are generally healthy. It's how our ancestors hunted after all-keep that in mind. 

Taking Eric and Dave's answers into consideration, we must understand that children's bodies are still developing. They won't have what we consider complete neuromuscular control over their bodies quite yet. I believe a structured lifting program for children can be a fantastic introduction to controlled multiplanar movement. I believe we tend to throw our kids into sport too early, not taking their developing physiology into account. One point I would like to drive home is that because your child/ren are still developing, recognize that most of the adaptations will be focused on the central nervous system and its ability to use the body's musculature; that hypertrophy, strength, or power should not be the end goal here. Rather, you should focus purely on movement patterns. Learning how to do an exercise safely and with great form vs. trying to get stronger. Once they hit puberty, then would be a great time to pursue muscular adaptation alone. ** 

Ok, firstly you're dealing with the human body. You have several different paths to turn to when it comes to producing energy, but they boil down to three: 

So continuing with my education, I've learned that resistance training isn't really going to help, unless I was unfamiliar with running in general, and I was blatantly weak in many areas. That is not the case. Resistance training and training with tools will not help, at least not at first. Typically tools aren't used to fix running form-they're used to make you more efficient. This means that I have to fix my running form first, before resistance training or use of tools will help. This is done through running drills. In my case, I desire to be faster in middle distance running (5k). My problem is lack of knee drive and dorsiflexion. I move my foot too far forward of my center of gravity, and when reaching the desired position, let it fall, rather than drive it down. 

That's it. Typically a good rule of thumb is to breath out when the weight is traveling against gravity. 

Right, the reason it travels touching the shins is because the resistance is close to your center of gravity. Drift like that means the bar is moving away from the center of gravity, which could mean more lower back activation. All in all, the bar should technically travel in a straight line, up and down. 

I will not diagnose, but it certainly sounds like plantar fascitis, or inflammation of the plantaris. This is likely due to over use. You can also try a tennis ball in the same fashion as the water bottle, and try pulling a towel with your toes until it's past the toes. To heal microtrauma from over-use, you have to let the plantaris rest. Because you have a high arch, I believe seeing a podiatrist (and conversely a pedorthist) will be in your best interest. Store bought solutions are typically not a great solution, unless your feet are in perfect biomechanical condition (most people aren't). Be sure to seek proper custom (made for you, and you alone) orthotics, and from a pedorthist who makes insoles in house-be wary, as many pedorthists send their stuff out. Custom orthotics aren't typically cheap, but your feet will thank you. Your podiatrist should have pedorthists to recommend, but once again, be wary-I've heard horror stories. Proper footwear should feel better right away-you typically shouldn't have to adjust to it unless there is something else going on, like you're trying out Fivefingers (safe to say those are contraindicated for you; more for those who have perfect feet again) Full disclosure, my father is a pedorthist. He makes his stuff in house. That is not where I'm getting the majority of my data though-I am a professional in exercise science. 

But I typically run out of time, and suspect to catch the second half later. What are the benefits to shorter bouts like this? What about cons? Time between sessions is going to look something like 2 to 3 hours. Should I be emphasizing strength or hypertrophy with splits like this? Any knowledge is appreciated, if there's any research, please point me in the right direction. Thanks! 

These energy systems all use and produce ATP (that's the main source of energy) in some way. To get ATP, they either break down: 

Underwent a gait analysis for a sports conditioning class. We found that my gait is way too long/wide. I'm heel striking like it's going out of style. The rear leg is consistently way too far back. As a result, I am not bringing up the forward leg high enough or fast enough. My upper body is also too tight, but that's not what I'm primarily concerned about. I also supinate too much. We plan on undergoing drills and other training modalities to fix these types of errors, but I wanted to ask here to get more input: I already regularly resistance train, but what can I focus on strengthening to counteract these multiple errors, and why? I also suspect I have inflexibility (earlier testing, not related to running), but this wasn't immediately obvious.
