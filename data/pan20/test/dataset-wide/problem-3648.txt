Thanks for the question. However answer can be quite complicated. I'll try to go through points I have in mind. Hope it help. 10-12 reps per set, with high weight is much. Normally up to 6 reps per set is considered as training for power. I understand that you don't want to go big. Look here or better - go to YT, and search for . Not all of them are big. In practice 10-12 reps means going big. More reps - like 15-20 gives stamina, lower, as wrote before. Perhaps that is somehow tested, but for me that is kind of wisdom, not always correct, or better - for some exercises it goes like that, for other probably not. So question is why you are doing 10-12 reps per set? If that month is your first month at the gym - perhaps you should talk with trainer there. That way you can relay on physical person's opinion. Also someone with experience can see what your are doing, and your new program can be based on that. More - you can ask for update after month or so. Other point, more as a side note - please do not do dead lift / squat after pull ups. Pull ups are relaxing your spine's muscles, and that is why this order is considered harmful. Dead lift uses whole back, but mostly lower back, gluts, hamstrings. So exercises like shrugs should not interfere much. Pull ups are other exercise that can be performed. After not before. 

Have you had any accident? Like falling on your right side / right hip? Or maybe you tend to sit on your foot. In both cases your hips / pelvis is not leveled, and that causes problems you've described. Best is to find out therapist. Mean while you can check this, and that videos. The exercise is very simple exercise you can try, and check if that is the case. Problem can be caused by pelvic tilt. Which means that it is shifted forward or backward. Here is other video, describing this problem. That tilt has influence on spine, and upper body. That is why I think that in your case problem is with side shift. What else it can be - watch your legs, when you are walking / running. Are feet putted the same? Problems with pelvic can be caused by feet. For that treatment isn't very complicated. As you could see - exercises are pretty simple, but you need to know what to do. Therapist is good choice. At least 2-3 visits, to guide you. After that a visit every year, or maybe twice per year - just to catch problems sooner, before you have pain. 

If that are only your worries, then go do. No one starts with really high weights. Be sure to start with personal trainer, and work on that tightness. Bench press is kind of exercise that I would not start with. Typically, people start with core exercises, all that stabilization stuff. Back should go first - that way your shoulders will go back - which is proper position. If you are (as me) working with computer, or driving a car a lot - shoulders tends to move forward, and that is first step to injury. Bench press is great next step. Do stretching, or mobilization - for shoulders, and upper-back - I'm using lacrosse ball. You need to stretch pectoralis, a specially minor. That would support moving shoulders back. ... or better go to the gym, and find trainer - and treat this post as another source of information. January is not a perfect time since everyone starts, on the other hand... there is no reason to wait. Just try to do it for longer then the others. Fingers crossed. 

Today it is really hard to eat not enough proteins during longer period. Our muscles are build of proteins. In theory if you don't have enough proteins to build cells, your regeneration will take for ever. Your body will try do use proteins from other cells if possible. Note that you are not eating pure carbs, nor pure fat. There are proteins there. Our body, when forced to the limits, is amazing when it comes to using given sources. So normally you can take, for instance half of proteins from food, since no more is needed. When you limit amount of them, by half... it not necessarily means that you are giving not enough. Despite exact numbers. 

If you look closely - that table is based on algorithm. For running it would not be that easy. I would look for something based on statistics. At school, we ware supposed to do particular number of reps, or run in particular time limit to get a score. So I've searched for and one of the results is this page. Hope that is what you ware looking for - at least you have a table. :) 

Thanks for the question. Abdominals are located between pelvis, and rib bones. So if you are flexing hips - that is not perfect move. By that I mean you are not isolating abs, and training some other muscles - like long leg of quadriceps - as well. Or maybe I'll start from other side - abs are responsible for stabilization, and something called abdominal compressor - here is sample article, with other references. So they are used, and trained in different situations, however it is good to have isolated exercises a specially if you are targeting that particular group. There are plenty of exercises you can do, perhaps you already know them, but I'll put them here to have consistent answer. There are - twists, with plate, plank, cable crunch. I mentioned isolated, but there are others as well. If you are training so versatile muscle group be sure to use different exercises. Mainly that is why I've putted that references. About plan - there is no plan that would work for you forever. Key is to change it, but also not too often - block should take 2 weeks and at least 2-3 that blocks makes a phase. So let's say you are working on definition for month or two. With smaller blocks, which allows minor adjustments. If writing about plan... I wonder how to track progress. Number of reps, or time in plank? But that is not your goal - you want it big. For posture muscles better effects can be achieved by bigger number of reps, with quite low weight which goes quite well with training at home. Also isometric exercises like plank are good. Other typical advice is to have one or two sets for targeted group at start of every training. That would increase load, so probably you can gain from that. Why probably? Because genetics can go against you. If you are doing a lot, and you can't get more - maybe that is the problem. Please find trainer, or physical therapist, someone skilled - to talk face to face. At least that way you can know if that is the problem. 

That can be anything... I would start with visiting doctor, and asking for blood test. It is not complicated, and can save a lot of effort. Other then that - use diet, or at least write down what you are eating. Diet is key here. If that is not working for you - you have other problem, like lack of D3 vitamin - that is why initially I wrote about blood test. 

First of all. Fat is not bad. It makes you feel full. Proteins have one problem - they makes acid level in your blood higher, so water is kept in the body. So if your diet is based on proteins - be sure to drink more. A specially when your see weight lose plateau. Think about your diet as long run. If you cheat a bit every day - it accumulates in a wrong way. If you cheat only once - in the long run that is almost nothing. Some people says that cheat day / cheat meal is needed to trick your body. When you are on diet, then your body sees it as poor days, and takes all from food. Cheat meal helps with it. I think that better option is to keep diet for longer period, and force body to deal with new situation. How much did you lost? That is wrong question. When you loosing weight - your muscles are also burned to get energy. That is a bit unwanted effect, so simply comparing weight is not good measure. From that perspective, there is good moment to cheat. If you eat after training insulin will move carbs to muscles first. As a side note. There is diet in which one day you are fasting - by taking around 600 kcals, and other day you can eat as much as you want. It appears that during open-bar day people are not eating that much - so overall intake is less then normal. 

There are two main points - what is effective, and what it means small - in terms of hands. For first - for arm wrestling big hands are asset. In other places - not so sure. Let me state it differently. Short people are better in bench press - so if you consider only this one exercise - being small is good. Question is if that is true in other areas as well. For small hands. I saw your examples. I've visited some forums of arm wrestling, with same question. Google is quite handy with it. What I saw is that referring to particular person hand's size different views ware presented. That is normal that person with small hands, talks about favorite champion would like to see something in common with him. But I think it is something else. Reading "normal hands as for arm wrestler" made me even more believer that it is an asset. I'm not arm wrestler. I just have small hands, and see part of your problems. For big handed person typical strategy is to use whale hand to squash. What you can do is to use only fingers. I've heard that famous violin players ware able to squash porcelain cups - in two fingers. Try to do that with an egg. Using it against opponent's bones can be quite effective. For them, and also for guitar players, point is that normally left hand is trained to squeeze. Which is not considered right when shaking hands. Arm wrestlers use both hands, but I'm not sure if that works for them. I would bet that rotator cuff, biceps, are more important here. For me, bigger problem is that thick bar is hard to catch, and hold. At the end I have to hold stuff only with fingers. However, I prefer to look on things like that as an asset, by thinking what I can do, and others can't. Gym is only part of our life. Who really cares if I can squat 200kg / 440lb, when I can't catch the bus? Hope this time I've explained my point of view, and that would not be considered as offensive. And as always I hope it help. 

Most people have different phases - for building muscles, and loosing weight. You simply can't lost only fat, and do that fast. When loosing weight, you go down with calories, and muscles also go away. That is why people build more muscles, and then go to "definition". Watching your plan - I would think about walking. Treadmill, constant heart rate - for fat burning, one hour. You can listen to podcasts, read something - what ever - just walk. As @Y12K suggested. Think about longer plan. You are going to the target in steps. At the gym steps are measured in two weeks. From that blocks you can build phases - like muscle building, or loosing weight. Then next phase. Other option is to target more different muscles. For instance, target your squats, do max. Then go down, just to maintain proper level, and go to dead lift, or bench press. You wouldn't get bored. Something is changing, but two weeks blocks allow stability, control. 

I don't think problem is with breath taking. If you have high deadlift, and a specially if that is classic one, you have much stronger back then legs. Try to keep your tibia straight, do not move knees forward. Here is more about it. That way you will use your back much more over quads. If you want to stick what you have now - make legs stronger. Also, as a comment - you keep head in strange position - it can be due to angle, but please take a look on it. 

In theory forward lunges mainly build up quads, while reverse are mainly targeting hamstrings. In practice that highly depends on how you do your exercise. Both exercises are static, so do them slowly. For forward lunges - just move one leg forward, and then go down with back leg's knee - slowly. Remember to maintain back straight, do not lean forward. Start with no weights, and use mirror to see if things goes OK. There are two things to watch - first is back, second - knee of front leg. Keep it over your foot, and do not move forward behind toes. When you go down, your knee moves forward, and then back - that should be steady, slow movement, without bump at changing direction. Usually that is problematic moment. Other point. Try to feel what is going on, and not to rely on mirror too much. To see what is going on - you need to turn your head, which ruins posture. That is not natural move for knee, so kind of discomfort is normal at start. If that is uncomfortable, then do 2-3 reps between other exercises. Just be sure that there is no pain, also it is good idea to ask trainer at your gym if you do it right. 

Thanks for interesting question. Sometime ago I was talking with friend, who trained 100 pushups program. Basically you have steps to do 100 pushups. For him problem was to go over 90. He started to run - and that helped. Not sure what is limiting you, but I'm sure you need to change something in other to deal with it. You can do other exercises, same exercises in different way, or try to work on technic. From this question I've learned that cycling is good for going higher with VO2. So being you I would try it - as different exercise. Here is other video helping people to run faster. That is more about speed, coordination, but I believe that it can be helpful in your case as well. You can put it around your warmup. Also that is about motion patterns which is good for all, no matter how you run. 

For our body muscles are cost centers in terms of energy efficiency. In other words if they are not needed - they are removed. If you are not training, there is no good reason to keep them, so they will be removed. It takes time, as building them takes time. For sure that process will go faster if you have negative caloric balance. However eating more proteins does not mean that they can be used, if your body is not "interested" in maintaining higher volume of muscles. If your workout break is short - say 2 weeks or so, and you have some physical activity anyway - there is no need to support your body. Specially that way. Note that usually we are eating enough proteins to deal without this kind of supplements. Try it for your self - how long it will take to get back after break - without or with proteins. It looks differently if that period is much longer, or you have to cancel all activities - say broken leg, being hospitalized, this kind of stuff. Then adding proteins is not beneficial anyway - as described above. Please note that size of muscle is one of many, many aspects here. Neural system, structure of the muscle. Ions. Please read here. Even if that is not your case - it can be beneficial to see how strong influence exercising has on our body. 

Interesting question. I'll try to go though all possible explanations / answers. Years ago there was a theory that muscle soreness comes from too much acid, produced by metabolism. That is not true. If trained enough - weakest fibers in muscles will be broken. That makes body reacting like on infection. So for that it would not help, since it is not an acid, causing the problem. Better blood circulation is good to remove all that what is not needed, anyway. Also, as you wrote, it helps with providing substances that are needed to build up new, better, stronger fibers. However you need to have it in your body. I know that people are eating Creatine after training to better support regeneration. You can eat sugar since higher insulin level will move it to muscles first, then to liver, and if both are filled - to fat. Question is how deep heating effect goes. We have heat detectors on skin level... I was using that heat creams like horse balm (since Finalgon is produced in Germany look for Pferdebalsam) and it went deep enough into my shoulder, but I don't think it can be effective for quadriceps / front of leg. I don't know anyone who is using it that way, however I know runners who are taking hot bath after each training to speed up regeneration, and limit the pain. Perhaps that is better idea, more relaxing, less painful, and I believe - cheeper. :)
