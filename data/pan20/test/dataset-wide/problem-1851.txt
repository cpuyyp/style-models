Is this a battle I shouldn't even try fighting? If not, what should I do to deal with this? Should I go out and buy business-casual wear, be hot and uncomfortable, just to sit where no one sees me and program? I would rather be comfortable and focus on my work, than be uncomfortable and focus on when I can get home and become comfortable. I don't have the social elegance or manipulation skills that my boss has, and am unable to effectively communicate with her on points she is set on. How can I effectively communicate the reasoning of why I should be able to wear whatever I find comfortable within company clothing policy? 

Good to note: This company has very low average wages, and is in the U.S. TL:DR: New project that I'm being put under a lot of pressure to do. I'm asked to perform full-stack developer duties as a low-paid data analyst. I feel abused at my current benefit level with the stress I'm under. It's not acceptable to ask about wage increases at this company, I need a way to effectively negotiate for a merit increase. 

Short historical summary: I've been programming at my current job for ~ 10 months now, I've setup QA, scheduling, adherence tracking, roster, and data pulling/warehousing/reporting for anything else that we needed in a callcenter environment. However, I've always been a "Team Lead" by title, while my superiors expect me to perform programming/data analyst duties. I will even get regular requests pull data from a new vendor and generate reports, or to add features to some tools to meet the needs of a different group. I was even offered the position, which was then rescinded due to it not being in the budget. This came with the difficulties of getting access to tools/data/sites that I need, which often required intervention from my boss's boss as I was just a Team Lead to anyone that I had not met before. For me this was a means to an end and I need to experience so I've went along with it. Meat of the issue: Recently, more and more sites have been blocked due to the restrictive firewall any call center would be expected to have. I've put in tickets to unblock necessary sites that house documentation on the tools/languages I am using. All of my tickets were recently denied. The majority of documentation for the tools and languages I am using as well as other resources such as stackoverflow have been blocked by the firewall. The decision was handed down by individuals very much disconnected from the program, or from the problems I run into when I cannot access developer documentation. The reason I recieved from them was: "This is not quite the direction that we want from your role within the program". I feel like I'm fighting to do the job I'm simultaneously expected to do. My work greatly benefits the colleagues, supervisors, and program managers in my center. It does very little for high-level management outside of the center as it's hard to quantify money saved through less wasted time on a monthly or quarterly report. How can I move forward with this? Do I continue fighting harder and harder to keep things running, or just stop and let it fall apart and hope for the best? I'm still getting requests for features, changes, and new reports from people who us them. Edit: I want to clarify: I don't think I'm 'hot stuff', I just landed into a company that has no internal toolings of any sort (~1500 employees). I was in an ideal position to start developing, a thousand problems to solve and the freedom to pick and choose and do anything I could to solve them. 

To start, I work as a Data Analyst/Web Developer in a callcenter. I sit in the corner of the building, on the call center floor. Company culture and policy describes a very lax dress code, where wearing casual and comfortable clothes is actively encouraged over more formal wear. My superiors and coworkers often wear street clothes to work, a few of them regularly wear shorts as the building can get a bit hot sometimes due to a lack of thermostat control. My new boss, a lady late in her career, who has been very motivational and helpful. Told our new team that she expects us to properly present ourselves. Which means no casual clothing, we need to wear pants and a collared shirt. The reason is that we will periodically be in meetings with company executives and other high-level leadership, that she expects her team to stand out and be presentable. During this meeting, I said that I would be more than willing to wear business casual clothing when in the executive offices or when attending scheduled meetings with executives. But that I get hot easily in the company buildings, and would much rather work while comfortable than not. She effectively shot me down and the meeting ended. Today, we had a 1x1, and she said that she considered my comment on her clothing policy insubordination, that I was being selfish, and need to stop thinking about just my own wants. Along with how I'm being selfish to ask for a double-wide desk because I can't fit my work equipment on the 2.5ft wide cubicle I currently am at... I was unable to eloquently describe why I don't want to wear business casual clothing while sitting in a back corner programming all day, she was very effective at turning what I was saying back around at me. In the end I almost felt like a petulant child with how I was being treated. 

You are probably not covered by workers compensation. So if you are injured on the job you will be SOL. There is no paper trail of your wages. Thus you have no proof that you have been paid at all (or even the correct amount) for your labor (and/or that the correct deductions have been made). You are now screwed by any situation that requires you to show proof of income and/or taxes. When your employer ditches you, you would not be able to collect any sort of unemployment benefit. If you continue to work under the table it could reflect badly on how future employers perceive your integrity. At the end of the year you will be responsible for paying all the taxes that were not with-held from your wages. Unless you are very strict with your budgeting you will find it hard to come up with the needed cash at tax time next year. You are also not paying into Social Security, so you can nix that when it comes time to retire. 

Being laid off was not your fault. That was a business decision beyond your control and you have the references to back up that you are a good working so that is nothing to worry about. For the second job I was in a similar position a few years ago. I joined a company, busted my gut, saved the project but got fired for the privilege. I kept that 6 months of work on my resume because it was for a new set of technologies that I hadn't previously worked in and help round out my skill set. When people asked me about those 6 months (of which I deeply wished to forget working at that company) I simply told them that the position wasn't a good fit for me. And from my point of view it wasn't because I really didn't want to work for a company that would throw me under the bus the first chance they got. So keep both jobs on your resume. Leaving both of them was out of your control and it seems that you didn't fail at either one of them. 

I don't think that mentioning your old boss is the right approach when talking to an interviewer, especially if you have no idea if you will be working with that old boss. If you will 100% be working with the old boss and he is in the hiring process then he should be able to do the math himself. On the other hand if you think you had a good working relationship with your old boss it may be advantageous to contact him directly and tell him that you are applying for a position where he is now. At the very least this could provide you with valuable inside information about the position and hiring process. It's not what you know .. it's who you know! 

Suspicious is one thing, proof is an altogether different thing. I am not condoning vandalism, but unless you have proof that it was done at work then involving HR is the wrong thing to do as it establishes a baseline of 

At most I would document it in a physical notebook somewhere, replace the sticker and keep an eye out for it being removed again while you are at work. At that point you have actual evidence you can present to HR. 

Last year I worked 7 months for a staffing company doing contract work in a different state to where I live in. The company paid me $10/hr less than what I would get than when I contract directly (and I am not expensive in the first place) plus I had to look after my own travel and accommodation expenses as well as everything else as I was working as a 1099 and the agency was not paying anything other than a flat rate. Financially the payback was equivalent as if I had been a full time employee. However when you are working short term contracts your earnings need to be much more than a regular salary in order to pay for all of your own overheads as well as for the down time when you are not working. I went with this gig because I needed the work, it was interesting stuff and I got to see a state that I have never seen before. However many other staffing agencies I spoke with last year wanted to pay well and truly under the market rate for my field of work. 

However you still need to fall under one one of the defined categories. From the job description I think you might fall under: 

It's not your problem to find who these emails are meant for. But I would say that it is your duty to bring notice to the correct people that you are receiving company sensitive emails by error. My take on this would be to contact HR and ask them where these emails should be forwarded to so that they can be dealt with. I say HR over your boss because it may also be that your boss should not see the content either. One caveat. Taking account of Dan's comment to the question, my answer is based on the emails being legitimate. It may be that you are subject to a phishing attack.
