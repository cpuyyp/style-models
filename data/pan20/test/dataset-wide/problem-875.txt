The practical length of the time exposure will depend on your equipment. Cameras used in astrophotography are generally able to be used with exposure times ranging from milliseconds to hours. As your question stands, cooling the chip will have no effect on the length of the exposure time. What it can affect is the amount of noise in the image. Cooling the sensor generally reduces the amount of noise. Cooling beyond -20°C may have limited value, particularly if you are not using research-grade instruments. While you may further reduce the noise, you may still be at the mercy of the quality of the optics, drive mechanisms, etc. and you may have less noise in the image but the limiting factor is not your image noise but the system limit for drift and distortion. Some professional instruments use liquid nitrogen cooling while others use thermoelectric cooling, depending on the manufacturer and the intended use. The instruments that use sub-zero cooling also usually have a high quality sensor with a pixel well depth that supports longer exposures, without bleeding effects from adjacent pixels. It all depends on the sensor, camera, and other parts of the system, so your mileage may vary.

As seen from the (first) figure, the ecliptic also touches the edge of the constellation Cetus, though it in not usually included in the Zodiacal constellations. Note about Precession: Because the Earth in inclined (by $23.45^{\circ}$), it rotates like a top. This is called precession, which results in a shift in the position of the constellations relative to us on Earth. The result is that the 'Signs of the Zodiac' are off by about one month. 

From this answer, it seems that the Harlan J Smith telescope located at the McDonald Observatory, in Texas, with a 107-inch (2.7 m) aperture is the largest aperture telescope that was ever fitted with an eyepiece. Some independent evidence is there to indicate that this indeed had an eyepiece. 

The dither pattern varies from telescope to telescope. For example, the following image shows the dither pattern of Chandra telescope. 

Galaxies are oriented in different directions, if we consider the orientation to be relative to their central axis of rotation. Then when we consider things like galaxies and their "direction" of spin, we tend to orient them so that "up" is the direction that, when we look at them from "above", they rotate in an anticlockwise direction - the same as observing Earth's rotation looking down from the North Pole. We tend to use a "right-hand rule" for this rotation, so that when the direction of rotation matches the curl of the fingers on the right hand, the thumb points in the "up" direction. What this means is that every galaxy rotates the same way. On the smaller scale what we see is that things in systems tend to rotate in the same direction - looking "down from above" on our Solar System we see that the planets all revolve in the same direction around the Sun (anticlockwise). The vast majority of smaller bodies also revolve in this same direction. The Sun rotates in this same direction. And the planets themselves tend to rotate in the same direction (exceptions being Venus and Uranus). This is understandable as the accretion disc would have been rotating during Solar System formation. So yes, for the most part at least, as far as we have been able to determine, everything spins the same way within its own environment. 

Analemma is a diagram showing the deviation of the Sun from its mean motion in the sky, as viewed from a fixed location on the Earth. Note that it says nothing about time- it can be any fixed time. Analemmas created at different times of the day have slightly different shapes. For example, see the solar analemmas taken at the same place at different times. 

The way telescopes work is pretty much the same in the optical and radio wavelengths- the telescopes collect electromagnetic radiation, rather than focusing at a point. There are multiple reasons for this, the main one being the amount of photons reaching the telescope from the region of interest is pretty low. In order to collect more photons, the telescope (or telescope array) has to 'look' into the area of interest for a long time- this is achieved in case of earth based telescopes by mechanically steering the antennae, so that they are pointed in the same direction for a long amount of time. The principle is pretty much the same in space. For looking at KIC 8462852, SETI used the Allen Telescope Arry, which is basically a set of 42 antennae scanning the skies in radio wavelengths. The problem of earth's rotation is basically solved in two steps by (radio) telescopes. 

No, stars that are seen through the asteroid belt are not any more variable than stars in any other part of the sky. All stars vary in brightness on measurable timescales, although some have been measured to have such small variations that they are recorded as "standard" stars and for most purposes can be considered to have a constant brightness and thus be used as reference for other brightness measurements. What you are referring to, as noted, are occultations. There are many hundreds of thousands of known asteroids in our Solar System, and billions of stars in our galaxy, and so there could be hundreds of predicted occultation events every day, and there are many people interested in occultation events. For one thing, we can calculate the distance and speed of an asteroid quite accurately but we can't directly photograph it to determine its size. But when an asteroid passes in front of a star, we can measure the duration of the occultation and set precise limits on its size. But for all the asteroids in the Main Belt, the space between them is huge and for any one star the chances of an occultation are quite (vanishingly) small, so the stars seen through the asteroid belt are not any more variable than anywhere else in the sky. 

Image from Meteors? Even More Remarkable by Bruce Maccabee at brumac.8k.com Consider the meteor path in the image above. it can be seen that, 

"Constellations ecliptic equirectangular plot" by Cmglee, Timwi, NASA - Own work, $URL$ Licensed under Public Domain via Commons. As a result, the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' and Ophiuchus (which was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy), the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. 

Solar analemma at 1400 UTC by Anthony Ayiomamitis, from solar-center.stanford.edu The best way to understand the effect of latitude on the shape of the analemma is to consider the effect of earth's axial tilt on the shape of the analemma. 

Another factor is the thickness of the atmosphere itself. The thickness of the atmosphere increases in path of the meteor from $H_{i}$ to $H_{m}$, and decreases from there to $H_{f}$. As the 'glowing' of the shooting star is directly dependent on the density of the atmosphere, its visibility trails of near the observer's horizon. This is another reason for the meteor looking like its falling towards the horizon. This can be seen clearly in case of meteor showers which appear to radiate from a point. 

You are forgetting parallax. Something which is very distant and lies on the celestial equator will have a declination of 0°, but if it is nearby then its declination will only be 0° to an observer located along Earth's equator. From your location in Zagreb, something like the ISS, even if it is crossing Earth's equator at a longitude of ~16° will appear to be in the southern sky, and your declination coordinate will likely be south of 0°. 

You can upload your FITS files to astrometry.net (or use an API) and get the coordinates. You can optionally get new FITS files back with the coordinates included in the metadata. From there you will be able to proceed with your processing. And, instead of uploading everything, you can also install a copy of the astrometry.net package locally if you're running Linux. 

Solar telescopes typically have filters to reduce the amount of light reaching their detector. Depending on their purpose they may use, for example, neutral density filters to reduce the amount of light to a level where they can resolve details without blocking any of the visible spectrum, hydrogen alpha filters to observe the Sun at a wavelength of 656 nanometres for observing features in the Sun's atmosphere such as solar prominences and the chromosphere, or blocking the solar disc to observe the Sun's corona, flares and other ejecta. Hubble, on the other hand, is designed with a very different purpose in mind such as taking long-exposure images to obtain the deep- and ultra-deep field full spectrum images. It avoids the Sun as even a very short exposure to the Sun would damage its instruments. 

The falling star or shooting star has nothing to do with a star. If shooting stars were actual stars, we'll be burning in their atmosphere, rather than the other way around. When a meteoroid, comet or (small) asteroid (or space debris in some cases) enters the Earth's atmosphere at high speed (typically in excess of 20 km/s), aerodynamic heating produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. This is called a meteor or shooting star (or a falling star). In general, the meteors travel in a (approximately) straight path. We usually see only the large ones travel down towards the horizon while the small ones are burnt up long before that (giving the impression of coming from the horizon). 

In general, the common practice is to dither exposures and fill in the gaps. The dither serves multiple purposes:

Assuming that this is a serious question... yes, Oumuamua will be tumbling, just like every other small body. That it comes from outside the Solar System does not change that it will have three axes of rotation because it is small and thus has not accreted enough matter that it would stabilise into a single primary axis. (This doesn't preclude one of its axes being a primary spin axis.) And just like every other small body, if we collect enough data in the form of reflected sunlight from its surface, we can construct shape and rotation models and estimate its size and composition. 

The Sun will be at your zenith a few days after 21st March, after it crosses the equator heading northwards* going towards summer, and a few days before 21st September, before it crosses the equator heading southwards* after summer has ended. * from an Earth-centric viewpoint. We know, of course, that the Earth is rotating about its axis and revolving about the Sun, and that Earth's axial tilt is what causes the seasons and the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky both through the day and through the seasons.
