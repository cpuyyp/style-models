In the gun world, companies will coat the reciprocating parts (mainly the bolt) with nickel-boron to reduce friction, going so far as to claim that you don't need lubricant. 

I'm looking for a pump at home to use with my high pressure (100-120 psi) road bike tires. My bike has presta valves, but I would like to be able to use it on Schrader valves, should I get a bike with them. Who has a floor pump that they like? 

While in the saddle, your feet should not touch the ground and your leg should be almost completely extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke. You ought to be able to straddle the top tube fairly easily with your feet flat on the ground. Sheldon Brown's article on starting on a bicycle may help with getting accustomed to having the seat higher than you are used to. Do visit his site to see the video, but here are the basics: 

As usual, Sheldon Brown has a great page on wheel building and you can learn more about the math from the above mentioned book. 

Sheldon Brown can show you how to fold a wire bead tire. Grab the tire at 10 & 2 O'Clock and overlap your hands until you have an uneven-size figure eight. Then just grasp the large loop of the figure eight, twist and push it towards the middle of the eight until you have three loops. Just tie it up with a strap and toss it into a bag. 

It sounds like you over-exerted yourself and "bonked" – your body ran out of sugar so you fainted. In that case, you reduce the risk by eating more while you ride* and by listening to your body more and backing off when it's getting too much. It may also be blood-pressure related: people with low blood pressure are (as I understand it) more susceptible to fainting. Since you're on blood pressure medication, you should talk to your doctor. I don't think bike fit is really a contributor but, of course, improving that would make you a happier, more comfortable cyclist so you should do something about it even if it doesn't help the problem you most want to fix. 

It will depend very much on the quality of the tubes. But, look, tubes aren't exactly expensive. Why not just replace them and your spares, for peace of mind and to reduce (by whatever margin) the probability of having to mess about at the side of the road when you wanted to be riding your bike? 

Using the 28T chainring doesn't move the top derailleur pulley any farther from the cog, so using a longer chain won't make any difference. It doesn't seem to cause any problems for me, though I don't use the 34T rear cog very often: it's too much of a jump in gear ratios from the next one down, which is a 24T. However, I don't have the same model of Tourney derailleur as you. Your derailleur looks like the RD-A070 and Shimano's compatibility listings indicate that this is only compatible with freewheels whose largest cog is a 28T. 

You can probably used the barrel adjuster near the brake lever itself to take up some slack in the cable. While looking from the cable towards the brake lever, turn the barrel adjuster counter-clockwise (to the left) a turn or so at a time until the distance of pull on the brake lever is reasonable. 

I'll credit this page for the formula; it also has more detail. There are also a bunch of calculators online, the easiest of which is probably Damon Rinard's spocalc spreadsheet. Other calculators: 

I have a continuum of clothes that I add on as the weather gets colder. During the summer, I ride like you do with shorts and a t-shirt. As things cool of a little bit, down below 60F/15C, I'll put on a windbreaker over my t-shirt and some full-finger gloves on my hands. The next step for me is to add an Under Armour Cold Gear shirt (many companies make equivalent tops) but to stick with naked legs, they're doing all the wok after all. Once temperatures get down to the 45F/7C range, I'll add som snazzy leggings in a fabric similar to the Under Armour top mentioned above. When things start to freeze, my final move is a fleece vest over the long sleeve top, but under my windbreaker. If things get even colder where you are, Icebike's clothing page is a good place to look for further advice. Keep two things in mind: you need a lot less clothing once you're moving and generating heat than you do standing around, but you also need to be prepared for a problem that might leave you standing around for some time. Dress light and carry extra clothes in a backpack. 

Why do you think they aren't recycled? EU legislation is pretty strict on what can go in landfill and it would be very surprising if the bikes fished out of the canals aren't recycled (i.e., melted down and the metal used for something new). 20,000 bikes is going to be at least 200 tons of scrap metal. After being underwater for a while, the bikes are probably sufficiently badly damaged that their parts can't be re-used: components such as bearings would probably be damaged beyond economical repair and structural components such as the frame and wheels would have corroded to an unknown amount and can't be guaranteed to be safe. 

If the heavy person and the light person were identical in all ways except for their weight (e.g., – warning, thought experiment only; do not do this – you, vs you after drinking a litre of mercury), then the heavy person will be faster downhill in a straight line. The reason for this is that there is a greater gravitational force pulling them down the hill, whereas by far the most significant resistive force is air resistance, which depends on speed and shape (which we assumed to be identical) but not mass. This means that, when freewheeling down a hill, the heavy cyclist will be able to travel faster before air resistance balances out the gravitational force. The same is true when you add the force of pedalling to the equation, since we're assuming that both cyclists can put out exactly the same power. However, this picture isn't entirely realistic as I've made a huge bunch of simplifying assumptions. In reality, the heavy cyclist will be larger, so will have more air resistance. I'm not sure what the trade-off would be, there. I've also assumed that the heavier cyclist will have the same rolling resistance as the lighter one. That's not going to be true but air resistance is much more significant so this shouldn't make a big difference. Also, I've only looked at straight-line speed. In real cycling, you have to turn corners, which usually requires slowing down. A heavier cyclist will need to brake earlier because, for a given speed, they have more kinetic energy to bleed off into their brakes. I'm not sure how much of the gain that would cancel out. 

Minimally, you want to be able to tighten all of the bolts on your bike (likely a few hex keys will do this) and an appropriate screwdriver for adjusting derailer & brake pulls. Separate from a multi-tool, a pair of tire levers are the other tool you should carry with you. I would add a chain tool to the above list after being left in a state where I would have been much happier were I so equipped. For that reason, I bought a Crank Brothers Multi Tool 17 which features the requisite hex keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool, in package that is smaller & lighter than most Leatherman tools. Some of the hex key sizes don't fit anything on my bike, but it's nice to have a set that can help most other riders. 

I only ride on the street, but I use a Nite Rider MiNewt on my helmet, which gives great visibility of the road ahead. For off-road riding you will want significantly more light, but I still think having a light on your helmet that follows where you look is quite useful. Couple something like the MiNewt with a 500 or more lumen bar light and you'll be in good shape. If you're handy, you could also build your own light. 

Idaho passed their law in 1982 and it was brought up in the Oregon legislature but failed to win enough support to be passed. California and Montana have considered adopting similar laws, but they have not yet been brought to their respective legislatures. So, in the US, it sounds like Idaho is still the only state with such a law. Here is an an animation explaining the law: $URL$
