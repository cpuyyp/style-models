Make a nutrition plan based on your needs and your goals Rest Start with a beginner's workout plan (You can get adviced by the gym stuff for all of those things) 

You can have red meat about 3 times per week, change the rice or the potatoes with pasta 3-4 times per week. You can have fish like salmod, tuna, tilapia 3 times per week. Beans or any other legume you like also 2-3 times. You can change the almonds with nuts or any other you like. In general for all these, don't fry your foods, just prefer to eat your olive oil raw at your salad or your meal. Cooking at a stir fry, on grill or steam cooker are great choices. Adjust the amounts of those foods (the grams of rice,chicken,etc) per meal for your needs and you will see the results you want. 

You can add dumbbells if you want to get higher volume. That would be a good workout to start working your leg muscles and add some mobility. You can do this one in a week or two if you change some of the excersices the second time. Don't expect to see enormous growth but keep training on a regular basis with a proper nutrition will give you the result you want. Also, excellent excersice for max quad growth is bicycle and all the variants. Especially trainining in incline will burn your quads. 

They would not wear anything to weigh them down for world record attempts. During races, there are water stations lined up at various checkpoints. If necessary, the athlete will grab and chug a cup or bottle of water while running. I don't know much about Dennis' record, but if I had to guess he just bolted straight through and dealt with the consequences while on the victory circuit. There is, of course, nothing stopping you from carrying your own water. It is quite common for people to wear sip belts or camalbacks. Though always check the rules of the race. Each race is different. For training, you could wear a sip belt or camalback as well. They will weigh you down, but it's better than being in the middle of nowhere after two-three hours of running and no water. Typically long-slow-distance runs are not about the speed and more about the distance, so the added weight is suitable. An alternate approach is to set up your own "water stations" by setting water bottles out throughout your route. The upside is there's no added weight. The downside is people will steal them sometimes. 

When following a strength routine, like yours (the three big lifts), you should include some optional excersices in order to have balance. Especially when you train for bodybuilding. It's prefered to be included one from the following excersises for each group per day: Back: 

A beginner like you, the age doesn't matter if you are starting now you are a beginner and it's not bad at all, shouldn't consider about strength if starts just now (beginner can be a person that is working out 0-2 years). First you have to get known with the place (the gym), the machines, the dumbbells, the barbells, etc. You have to learn how to execute the exercises in the proper way and understand how a training program (split) works. Only in this way you will understand how your body responds and reacts on your workout. Besides your training the really first thing you must schedule and define clearly is your nutrition. Only with an appropriate nutrition you will be able to build muscles and strength properly. Combined with the necessary rest. To sum up: 

But. If you want a wake up call before your workout drink a single espresso 30-45 minutes before. If you want an energy pump, a small fresh apple is just enough also 30-45 minutes before. 

I would say.... inconclusive. I found this which is a compilation study on the studies of compression clothing specifically for runners: $URL$ In it they found that the sleeves main benefit is the raise in muscle temperature which they claim helps reduce post-leg soreness and muscle fatigue. They did not find any benefit in athletic performance, although reduced muscle fatigue will mean that you can run slightly faster or longer bursts. Yet here is another article on the effects of DOMs and wearing compression clothing: $URL$ In it they conclude that there is no difference in both performance or DOMs when wearing compression clothing or not. This one on the effects of compression clothing notes that there might be some reduction in perceived muscle soreness for some people though it seems to be small. And this seems to be the theme for most of these studies. The problem with studies like this is it's absolutely impossible to remove the placebo effect. You can't do a double blind study like you could with medicine. The positive effects may be because people believe it works. From an athletes perspective, they want to give themselves every advantage they possibly can within the bounds of the rules of their sport. There is some evidence that compression clothing might help. Basketball and baseball hasn't banned compression clothing yet, so they wear compression clothing even though the science on it seems rather scant. This is why a few years ago, it seems like everyone at the Olympics was wearing KT tape. This is why last year's Olympic fad was cupping. Neither had super-strong evidence supporting their usage at the time, but there was some so athletes used it. EDIT: Perceived recovery benefits aside. There are other reasons to consider compression gear. It doesn't get in the way like more baggy clothes. It's light. They tend to be very durable. It does help keep people warm which is important in the colder months. Compression clothing can just be comfortable to wear. 

Playing football once i a week won't affect you bad at all. Neither walking a lot. If you really want to grow your legs you should consider doing a proper training. Spartan Bows can be a good excersice but it won't give you bigger quads just by itself. The best way is at the gym but if you can't go to the gym or you don't want, you can train at home. A good workout program for legs would be something like this: 

You have to clear and define what is a diet. There is no magic food that will increase your weight or decrease your body fat. A balanced, adjusted to your needs and your goals diet will bring you the results you want. If you want to gain weight (muscles) you have to make a calorie surplus diet. If you want to lose body fat you have to make a minus calorie diet. If you just over eating you will just gain weight (muscles) + fat. On the opposite if you just under eating or not eating you will just lose fat + weight (muscles). 

Think of it from a survival stand-point. To your body, working out is an environmental hazard that it has to adapt to. For example, it doesn't equate bench pressing as "a workout" or "an exercise". It just knows that, for whatever strange reason, you need to bench press a lot. It needs to adapt to this environment where you bench press a lot, so it increases its ability to bench press so that it can better handle this environment and increase your chances of survival. Normally, you would not get to dictate when you need the ability to do something. You either are capable of doing it or not. So in this bizarre reality where you're constantly bench pressing, you need to be prepared for it as soon as possible. You would (to your body) risk serious harm or death if you couldn't do something because your muscles were too sore from the previous day. Now, the reason why things hurt like crazy at first is the body doesn't necessarily want to be in this environment. It takes energy to be adapted to such things, so it wants to use that energy to adapt to the environment that it's currently in.
