You are over thinking this, an internship is not a job as such. You just say "after interning with Acme co and learning valuable real world experience I am now looking for my first full time position" I am assuming you have graduated 

As a self employed contractor when it comes time to renew you contract is the time to increase your day rate. Or are you working for a body shop its your "employer" you need to ask about getting a raise if you are doing work above your pay grade I would assume they would be keen to increase the rate you are charged out at. 

In the UK you don’t get the formal written contract up front in 99% of cases - there is no statutory right to a written contract in the UK. You have a contract when you accepted the job offer – the offer letter does have the major features of your terms of employment grade, hours of work and salary, did your offer have these or not. Employers must provide a written statement of employment particulars within 2 months for employment lasting more than on month. Attempting to insist on written contract will be seen as odd and just not turning up puts you in breach of contract don’t do that. Additionally, if you are claiming benefits you run the risk of being sanctioned by the DWP and losing your benefits. The government has a guide here $URL$ 

You should charge a lot more to cover the lost benefits and to allow for down time between contracts. The common rule of thumb used in the UK and else where for self employed contractors is 3x the rate for a full time employee and work out you day rate from that. eg assuming a full time employee is on £45k and assuming there are 260 working days in the year (45000 x 3) /260 this gives a day rate of approximately £500. 

To directly answer the question - which no one has done yet. Stick to a minimum of 10 Point Anything less risks being hard to read to read and you can't assume that every reader has 20/20 vision and you risk getting your cv discarded especially if its being read by an older person Don't get to hung up on exact numbers about the number of pages in a cv there is no magic trick here. 

The reason why a central location in cities is preferred is 1 Better Transport Links using London as an example you can commute to the central area (basically the circle line) from any where in the south of England put it out on the edge as Ebay has at Richmond (which isn't even on any of the main lines) and your potential pool of recruits is drastically reduced. Also Richmond is super posh and expensive. 2 You are closer to sources of capital. 3 People like working in a centre of a lively city. 4 More controversially on of the past CEOs of BT said "World leading companies don't have a head office in a expletive shed out at Heathrow" 

1 Website migrations related Questions should be asked on $URL$ 2 In General the web admin/devs should follow the instructions of your manger. They should know how to do this, if not you need to hire an external SEO Agency to help with the implementation its not rocket science but strict attention to every! detail is a must 

This appears to be the statutory minimum notice in the UK its not that uncommon. Yes it is acceptable to take a job with the aim of eventually finding something better. In almost all cases its better to be working as you are building up qualifying years for things like state benefits and also missing any employer provided pension payments. Its also easier to get a job if you are already working. Also in the current climate rejecting a job offer can cause problems in claiming benefits, even more so if you in an area that uses Universal Credit. 

It does look like you would be classed as an employee under IR35 however you would need to get a lawyer to check this and to draft an IR35 friendly contract. $URL$ Supervision, Substitution, Mutuality of obligation and Control are some of the key areas HMRC look at to determine if you are a true self employed. Oh and remember the rule of thumb is charge 3x the rate that a full time employee would get as an employee. 

Yes you do have the right to collect evidence and notes in this case It appears you are raising a grievance with your employer, in this case if they are not allowing you or your lawyer access to evidence (The mailbox) this would be a serious breach of procedure and legal custom and practice. Note that if It did go to tribunal if the employer denied you access to your email this would be a massive red flag and your Lawyer would have a field day it would probably be an automatic win for the employee side. If you haven’t formally raised a grievance over bullying (check your employee hand book) do so now and also raise one on being denied access to evidence. You should also talk to your union if you are a member, the CAB or an employment lawyer. 

Your probably stuck with 3 months in Europe and UK 3 months is common for all but the most junior professional role. However if there is a probationary period you might be able to shorten the notice periods. The CLA has probably been replaced by a more recent one (speak to your union rep) or look on the union website. The USA is an outlier in having such short notices and a lot of your colleagues would look at someone complaining about this as unprofessional 

No EU regulations are devolved to countries to implement eg TUPE is quite different from country to country - you would need to check locally in the country concerned. 

No you cant do this in the UK the probationary period is totally within the employers control subject to the legal safe guards which are there to protect the employee. You could ask the employer to extend probation for 1 or 2 months but you run the risk of the employer have you fail probation and you are out of a job - that might be tricky to explain when you go to sign on for benefits. I suspect that you are not originally from the UK and are unfamiliar with the legal set up for professional jobs (which a developer is considered) having 1 month or greater is the norm (having longer notice periods is also part of the unwritten class structure ie only low or unskilled workers have short notice periods). Having said that in the uk you have much less rights in the first two years of employment so if you do find a better job within 2 years you might be able to negotiate pay in lieu of notice and leave sooner - that will depend on employer. I would advise against trying to extend your probation period you will been seen as that odd person who doesn't fit in and run the risk of losing your job. 

Proper leadership requires regular feedback to employees. Whether that's weekly, bi weekly, or monthly. This doesn't include yearly evaluations. During this time managers should be setting SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely). When I was a manager this was handled with a notebook containing all my direct reports' biweekly forms we filled out for them, which I then used for their yearly evaluations. It doesn't have to be anything specific. But at the very least managers should be meeting with employees on a monthly basis to go over this type of stuff. The weekly/biweekly/monthly reviews are for short term things. Discuss just the previous x time. The yearly evaluation is more serious, longer, more detailed, and is used for things like promotions and transfers. IMO any company of any size should be doing this, whether you have 5 employees all together or 500,000 A lot of the stuff discussed in these meetings can be also handled in standups and retrospectives but the individual meetings shouldn't be skipped as that's the time managers should be using to mentor their direct reports and helping them achieve both their goals and the company's goals. There's tons of software out there. You could write your own. OR you can use paper. How you do it doesn't matter so much as doing it. Our bi weekly forms had specific KPI's that showed the previous period's numbers, the goal, the current periods numbers, and next periods goal. There was a section for managers to put their feedback down. And for employees to put their response and feedback down as well. As well as a section for the action plan. Our yearly evaluation was 2 parts. A self evaluation. And one done by your manager that included their responses to your self evaluation. You always give the employee an opportunity to say in their own words how they feel they did for the period especially for yearly evaluations. This way they can highlight some things to you and you as a manager don't forget the biggest thing they did that year (the employee will bring it up in their portion). It's always a good idea to include both what was done well and what needs improvement, both in the managers and the employees words. Edit: Larger companies do them more to be able to trim the fat when they need to lower numbers. There's some companies that straight up fire the bottom X percent of the company. I don't really like that second approach as I feel that someone that needs to be fired should be fired long before a yearly review. That's one of the big reasons for regular shorter periods of reviews. Yearly reviews should also generally be reviewed by the managers manager as a sort of checks and balances role. 

When you run out of items and still have time tell your boss you're gifting him X minutes of his day back. Managers shouldn't be doing 1:1's to fill time they should be doing them to give and receive feedback to/from an employee. You should be using this time as a means to getting a promotion. This is the time you use for your manager to mentor you and help you gain that role you want. If you're a developer, and want to be a developer lead, you should ask your manager for mentorship on leadership topics. I'd also propose a bi-weekly meeting of 1 hour or weekly meeting of 1/2 an hour. This is also a great time to bring up any issues you're having with tasks. If you have a task due in 2 weeks for instance, and you are running into a block of some type this is the time to bring it up with your boss. This is also a good time to go over any HR type stuff with your manager if you have anything. As an employee or manager I've always loved when 1:1's are shorter than their allotted time. I definitely could always use an extra 15 minutes even if it's just to pee. 

I wouldn't worry unless you have a reason to worry. Such as poor performance or you know there are some budget cutbacks on the way. As for how to approach your boss. Direct and open is always the best approach in my opinion. Just say straight up that you received the invite and upon looking it looked like a job search board and you're concerned about your job security. He should immediately put it to rest or (unfortunately) let you know your time may be limited. But it's odd that short of performance or culture fit reasons you would be let go after only 2 months. I've had it happen to me once as a Salesforce consultant and that was because I was hired to manage 8 projects in the pipeline and the sales folks only 2 got closed. But I was aware coming in. But have you discussed wanting to explore some freelance work on the side with anyone? Specifically your boss? 

Recruiters are a dime a dozen. Even within recruitment firms. Just hitup LinkedIn and connect with recruiters in your discipline. Recruiters have no business knowing what you do outside of interviews they get for you. You're nothing more than a product they're trying to sell to a company. Don't forget that. They ask these questions because they want to both see what companies may be interested in hiring a recruiter to fill some posts as they have a demonstrated rejection which means they've already wasted time interviewing people and they also want to know why people are rejected for specific jobs so they can better qualify their leads for not only a future contract with them but hiring managers in general. Some things become a trend and a recruiter is usually the first to notice it. They will ignore you if they don't have anything you're a good fit for. Just like any other salesman. They give attention to the most likely client to land them a big check, and work their way down. If they don't have anything for you or there are higher commission jobs they'll just keep you on the backburner. Edit: For this reason you need to keep the same type of attitude you would have about a salesperson or business. If they're hassling you pressuring you coercing things from you you want to sever that relationship and not shop from there. Make them work for you to earn their paycheck. Don't fall into the product mentality. Edit2: You also don't want to work with someone that tells you confidentiality expires. Their ethics are obviously pretty warped.
