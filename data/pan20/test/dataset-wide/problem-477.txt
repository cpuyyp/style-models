I took my bike in recently for the usual periodic overhaul. One set of brake pads was replaced, brake cables (relatively new) were lubed, all that good stuff. Since then, both front and back brakes (so, one with brand-new pads, one with older) have developed a periodic once-a-pedal-cycle squeak... but only when it's cold out (roughly, freezing or under). I took the bike inside today, and it didn't squeak at all on the start of my ride afterwards, but was just starting to squeak again as I got home. On the back brake (worse squeaker, new pads), I can stop the squeak while riding if I squeeze the brake just a tiny bit -- not quite enough to engage it. Bike has non-hydraulic disc brakes, carbon drive with Alfine IGH. Brake effectiveness is fine. Ideas for what's causing this and how I can make it stop? It's maddening. Similar but not identical: How do I get rid of the noise on my Hayes Stroker Trail brakes 

Based on your comment about where your pain centers, it sounds as though your median nerve is acting up. The likeliest causes of this for a cyclist are leaning too hard on the slight depression in the middle of the base of your palm, OR a hand position that twists your hands (inward/outward and/or up/down) relative to your wrists. Check for these next time you ride. Do see a doctor if you can (you may have to be firm about being referred to a physical therapist or sports-medicine expert). It's easiest to deal with this soon after it is noticed, certainly before it is debilitating. (Which it can be. My non-cycling-caused ulnar neuropathy had me holding my hand against myself so no one would so much as touch it, and it took six solid months of punishing therapeutic massage -- don't be fooled; physical-therapy massage is NOT gentle or enjoyable! -- to rid me of it.) Varying your hand positions may help avoid the problem in future; I would recommend ESPECIALLY avoiding the brake hoods, as they can hit RIGHT where you don't want them to. Your bicycle has drop bars, so you can experiment. I have found that my Velo Orange trekking bars somehow manage to avoid ever letting me rest my hand on that central depression, and allow at least two neutral hand-wrist positions, so changing bars might also help you. Why left hand rather than right? It may not be anything in your cycling, though you can certainly watch for something. Our bodies aren't perfectly symmetrical, and general stress on them isn't either. Good luck! I hope you resolve this quickly and as painlessly as possible. 

I know that cutting material out makes a bike lighter, but at some point there must be a crossover between weight and aerodynamics. Since tri-bikes and track bikes have more oval/flat shaped tubes, you'd think that closing off the entire front triangle would improve aerodynamics even more. And making it out of carbon fiber wouldn't add too much weight. See also the use of enclosed wheels. So, outside of the obvious reasons of weight and the loss of a bottle cage, why wouldn't you want to do this? 

Screw extractor: Inexpensive and easy to use. Drill: Use successively larger drill bits until most of the screw is gone. Drill and extract: Drill a spot large enough to put something in the middle and pull it out. Screw/Nail Extract: Lightly tap a nail or smaller screw into it and then try to unscrew the stuck body. Melt it: Not really recommended but you could do it. Be prepared to retap the threads if things go awry. 

There could be a couple different issues at work, but it's most likely that the bearings need to be re-greased and/or tightened. On some pedals, that little screw simply holds the pedal body together and the amount of grease in the bearing area will determine how tight the whole assembly holds together. On the other hand, some pedals have a preload that adjusts how tight the assembly is, simply tightening this might solve your problem. I would recommend tightening that bolt and see if the problem persists, if not good; if it does, then either replace the pedals or take them in to a shop to take a quick look. 

So this morning I'm riding to work on my shiny new tourer, when my trouser leg gets caught in the Gates belt drive. Not good! I'd rather not go the leg-strap route if I can avoid it, which leads me to ask whether a chain guard or chainring guard exists that would fit over a belt, given that the belt is wider than a chain. The crank is a Shimano Tiagra, if that matters. 

Insofar possible, don't be the cyclist stereotype in someone's head. Or if you can't avoid it, find another cyclist who isn't, and introduce them. If you're the kind of Lycra Lad/Lass superhero type (right down to the spandex!) usually seen in bike advertising, this will be difficult, granted. A lot of us aren't like that, though, and that helps other people who aren't like that think "hey, if they bike, maybe I can too." Cyclists who wear street clothes (even dresses) while cycling, fat cyclists like me, middle-aged (me!) and older cyclists, cyclists who cycle home in triumph with the farmer's-market haul for the week in panniers or Wald baskets... the more visible we are, and the more we seem to like our cycling without becoming intrusive evangelists for it, the more we break down imagined barriers to cycling in others. Anecdotally, an unconventionally attractive, comfortable-looking bike can be a useful conversation piece. I got into a lot more conversations with curious strangers over my purple Electra Townie with its unusual curved outline than I do now with my somewhat more conventional-looking custom step-through. (Though it's lavender-colored, and that helps.) 

Basically the title is the questions, but to repeat is there a bike weight limit for riders who belong to a national association such as USAC, but are not riding for UCI points or registered with UCI? Or is it the same as the UCI limit? 

It's really up to you how often to check your adjustments, but I'd say it's not an "every ride" kind of check, unless you're giving your drivetrain a workout! If there's any damage to the derailleur, hanger, or rear wheel, you may want to start there as well. To specifically address your questions: 

So you've got multiple reasons why the manufacturer/seller has different ring materials. It's most likely a combination of the above, and a tradeoff for one or more (more weight vs less strength, etc.). 

I'm currently racing a state XC MTB series and will be moving up to Cat. 2 next year. As part of my goals, I'd like to get some sponsorship for the 2014 season. I have a few questions about this though, and I'd love to hear from racers or industry employees who may deal with this. 

I realize this is pretty broad, and I have the general idea of how a race weekend goes from watching way too many PinkBike videos, but most of those are large races with sponsors, etc. Also, the size of the first race will most likely be less than 50 racers or so. 

I do this. It works well enough. Warmers do tend to slip a bit over the knees, but honestly they do anyway. Go for it. 

Planet Bike's small parts page has a section for tail lights that includes quite a few shims and adapters. You may be able to find just the thing there. Good luck! 

There's an outside chance it's frozen cables. Definitely not the likeliest problem, but if you run through everything else and it's still happening... 

On the cheaper side, a tarp or a vinyl tablecloth should do the trick, and be more easily tidied away and stored. Even a decent-weight shower curtain! 

You might be able to get away with a handlebar bag (Ortlieb has a waterproof one that claims to hold 7l) plus a messenger bag or light backpack, or the underseat stuff sack mentioned by Chris in AK. I agree with commenter Blam that leaving the shoes at work will drastically reduce the needed volume. A porteur rack in front might do the job too, and perhaps be a bit easier to remove than a rear rack. (Much depends on your brake setup; it's easy to get a front rack off my bike because its disc brakes don't get in the way.) Linus and Velo Orange have nice porteurs. 

This isn't a "need" so much as a "nice-to-have," but I certainly appreciated having handy-wipes (alcohol-soaked individually-packed wipes) along after fixing a flat on my trail ride last Friday. Also useful if whatever you're looking at is so grimy/dusty you can't see or handle it properly. If weight/bulk is not at a premium, in the States it's possible to buy a can or square of diaper wipes. Same idea, different branding, works just as well. You may find that your first-aid kit has these already; in that case, just keep 'em stocked! 

There's no problem mounting a disc-compatible hub to rim-brake compatible rim. Just make sure they've got the same number of spokes and you're good to go. You're absolutely right about the opposite though, disc brake rims generally do not have a braking surface on them, the rim profile is round there, so it wouldn't work. And if you did try to brake on it, it a) wouldn't work well and b) would probably cause excessive rim wear. What you could do, if you want to be flexible and switch back and forth is to get a dual-duty rim that supports both, such as the WTB Dual Duty FR rims (probably a bit beefy, but you get the idea). 

Like the title says, I'm looking for some recommendations on good flat pedal shoes. This could include ones with an SPD or other interface that has removable clips. I'm currently riding with a set of 5.10 Freeriders, which offer great traction and grip to flats, but are really heavy. At some point, I'll probably have to force myself to race clipped in, but for now I love my ability to quickly dab and destroy any downhill sections. Quick breakdown of what I'm looking for: 

In my experience, it depends on how much has actually changed. Usually the lower quality groups (Shimana Alivio/Deore, SRAM X5/X7) don't change too much because they are very similar to the OEM parts. However, the more expensive groupsets incorporate the trickle down method you mention. Things like clutch derailleurs are becoming available in the middle price ranges versus the top tier. Adding something like that will greatly decrease the previous year's model, while increasing the new one's. Most of the time though, it's like a car. As soon as you drive it off the lot, the value drops. Even if it's brand new, as soon as the next year rolls around it's lost value. Marketing and hype are what sell product and new product is always pushed first. 

Rim brakes are skirt-eating monsters. Disc brakes, not as much. (Yes, there are other mitigators, but this one alone made me ask for disc brakes on the bike I'm having built. I like wearing long skirts to work.) 

If you and she are willing to throw down on a custom, I can personally recommend Violet Crown Cycles. Otherwise, consider the Rivendell Betty Foy/Ivan Gomez or building up a Soma Buena Vista... but she might actually do fine picking up a mass-market step-through that fits well (Electra, Jamis, and Trek have models worth looking at) and upgrading the components as desired. For a ride that long, I would actually recommend against a Dutch bike; something speedier would likely be better. Believe it or not, an upright posture is not necessarily ideal; I find that a more forward-leaned posture keeps long skirts from blowing back and up in headwinds. (There are other ways to deal with this. The headband-round-one-leg trick works.) Avoid crank-forward/"flat foot" designs for this reason. I will disagree with Batman above regarding durability. Though I've seen that claim many a time, I have yet to see anyone with a horror story regarding a mixte or step-through frame falling apart or anything similarly catastrophic... or even bothersome, for that matter. I've gotten along just fine with both my step-throughs; if they flex more, I don't notice it. My somewhat ornery but experience-driven suggestions for skirt-friendly bikes: 

Unicycling is such a niche thing that I doubt you're going to get much in the way of scientific results saying any improvement in riding skills, but I'll give it a shot. Since there are such things as mountain unicycles, you can certainly improve your skills! Balance, cornering, and trail sense (knowing what to do on what terrain) are common skills no matter how you ride. Things will be a little different in regards to bike handling, managing the front wheel, and jumps. If you're looking to do it expressly to improve on your mountain bike skills, I would recommend sticking to the two-wheel variety. Now, if you've got an arm injury or something like that, then it would be a good alternative to at least do something. *Personal note: most folks think unicycling/cyclists look ridiculous and you will get laughed at more often than not (if not always to your face). So if you can handle that too, then go for it! 

Strange that this would be where things are coming loose. My recommendation is to remove the rear wheel and chain and make sure nothing else is coming loose either. If it's just the connection to the hanger, check the threads on both the derailleur and the hanger as one or the other may have damage or contaminants. Clean and lube/locktite the bolt and re-install the derailleur. If you continue to have problems, I'd have a mechanic check it out. 

Turn left directly from the bike lane. Keeping a weather eye on traffic, move into the left-hand lane and turn from there. Veer right onto the sidewalk (avoiding buses, obviously); wait for the pedestrian light to cross. 

There are housecall vets, (a very very few) housecall doctors, and of course food delivery. I don't see why housecall bike repair wouldn't fly. 

Anything else I've missed? I'm consciously changing my coasting posture, and trying to train myself to Sheldon-Brown-mount with opposite feet. If there's anything else I could be doing, it would be good to know. 

I have perfectly ordinary standard-pull brake levers on my bike. When the temperature gets below 20F or so, the left-hand one seizes up, not wanting to pull, and not braking well if I force it. Once the temperature warms up a bit, it's fine. Diagnosis? Cure? I'm pretty sure the actual brakes are fine, and the cable looks okay too. (If there's a duplicate, feel free to kill this one; I looked but didn't find an exact symptom match.) 

I suggest a spare bike lock or two. I can't be the only person who's forgotten to replace the lock on the bike after washing the bike, and ridden happily off to work the next day without noticing. The great thing about this is that a rider should only need the lock during the workday!
