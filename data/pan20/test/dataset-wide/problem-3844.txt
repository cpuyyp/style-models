Yes $D$ must be finite-dimensional over $F$. This follows from a Theorem of Kaplansky's that I found in Herstein's monograph "Noncommutative Rings". The first step is to show that an algebraic algebra of bounded degree satisfies a polynomial identity (see Lemma 6.2.3 in Herstein), i.e., is a P.I. algebra. Note, however, that the degree of this polynomial identity may be larger than the degree of the algebra, as defined in the question. Then since a division algebra $D$ is primitive, one can use: 

Not in general, although there may be some classes of algebras where it holds. For a simple counterexample $A$ consider the path algebra (over an infinite field) of the quiver $$1 \stackrel{a, b}\Rightarrow 2 \stackrel{c}{\rightarrow} 3$$ modulo the relation $ca=0$. This algebra has global dimension 2, so in particular the subcategory of modules of finite projective dimension is all of $A$-mod, which is contravariantly finite. However, the simple module $S_1$ has no right-approximation by a module of projective dimension $\leq 1$, so $P_1$ is not contravariantly finite. Informally, one sees there is a one-parameter family of nonisomorphic indecomposables with dimension vector (1,1,0), each of which (with one exception) has projective dimension 1, and maps onto $S_1$. Then one can check that there is no single finite-dimensional module of projective dimension 1 through which all of these maps can factor. I believe that one can make this argument more rigorous (but I haven't checked the details) by using the fact that this algebra $A$ is stably equivalent (by constructing a node) to the algebra $\Lambda$ studied by Igusa, Smalo and Todorov in their paper "Finite projectivity and contravariant finiteness," Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 109 (1990), no. 4, 937-941. 

According to Wolfram Alpha and the tables in [2], $\pi(10^{10}) = 455, 052, 511$. Nevertheless, in Don Zagier's paper listed below we find that $\pi(10^{10}) = 455, 052, 512$. Wonder whether someone has already noted this discrepancy between the sources elsewhere. Naturally, the discrepancy implies the existence of a bug in either the routines of Zagier or in WA's implementation of the prime counting function. I don't think that it's only a typo in Zagier' note because, if my memory serves me right, there are some other texts in the literature that endorse the computations of Zagier (for instance, see [1, page 7].).

E. S. Pondiczery was a pseudonym used by R. P. Boas, Jr. in the paper Power problems in abstract spaces. The name became part of the well-known Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem. Another pseudonym used by Boas (and F. Smithies) was H. Pétard. I highly recommend that you take a look at the hilarious Lion hunting and other mathematical pursuits (A collection of mathematics, verse, and stories by the late Ralph P. Boas, Jr.) for more information in this regard. Added (Nov 7/2010). In that book you can also learn about other pseudonyms (for instance, Ian Stewart's one) and the memorable feud 'twixt Bourbaki and Boas. Added (Nov 8/2010). According to page 10 of the aforementioned book, H. Pétard was in fact a pseudonym that Boas and Smithies made up for the use of E. S. Pondiczery. 

When $R$ is a simple curve singularity, the category $MCM(R)$ has finite type and the structure of its Auslander algebra is known. (When $\mathcal{C}$ is a Krull-Schmidt category with only finitely many indecomposables up to isomorphism, one can form a basic representation generator $M$ as the direct sum of one copy of each indecomposable object. The Auslander algebra of $\mathcal{C}$ is then defined as the endomorphism ring of $M$.) A good reference for information about the Auslander algebras of simple curve singularities is Chapter 9 of Yoshino's book Cohen-Macaulay Modules over Cohen-Macaulay Rings. In particular, Yoshino computes the Auslander-Reiten quivers of $MCM(R)$ for the A-D-E singularities, which can also be viewed as the Ext-quiver (or bound quiver) of the associated Auslander algebra, call it $\Gamma$. Thus $\Gamma$ is a quotient of the (completed) path algebra of this quiver, and I believe the relations of $\Gamma$ can be chosen to be the "mesh relations" (i.e., there is one relation coming from each almost split sequence in $MCM(R)$. Unfortunately, I don't have a good reference for this fact, but it should not be too hard to verify by choosing nice irreducible maps corresponding to the arrows of the quiver and computing the relations they satisfy.) Now the endomorphism ring of a single indecomposable MCM $R$-module can be computed as a corner ring of $\Gamma$. For instance, I would start by identifying the minimal nonzero cycles at the vertex corresponding to the indecomposable module of interest. I haven't tried to do this myself for the $f=x^3+y^4$ example, so perhaps it is harder than it sounds. In fact, in this case it seems nontrivial to compute even the endomorphism ring of $R$ itself in this way. 

The definitions of a divisible group that I have seen all seem to assume abelian is an a priori property of the group. My question is as to whether or not it is known that--given a non-torsion element $\tau\in\mathbf{G}$* and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, do we know if $\exists \tau'\in\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\tau=\tau'^n$? The motivation is that--if this never happens--then the fields $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ should be sort of "maximal" subfields of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ since fixing by the generator would be equivalent to fixed by any power of it. Edit: anon has noted that quotients of divisible groups are divisible, so we can lay to rest that $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ is not divisible. Can we tell if the opposite is true? I.e. the answer to "can I find such a $\tau '$ given $n$" is "no", but how about the somewhat interesting and related question: If I have a cyclic subgroup of the absolute Galois group, $C=\langle\tau\rangle$ can we find a maximal (with respect to inclusion), cyclic group containing $C$? Of course this is equivalent to a minimal field in a chain, so it seems like if that is so something interesting must be going on. The other related question which deals with the original spirit of the problem is: are there $\tau$ such that $\langle \tau^n\rangle$ fixes $k\subseteq\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ then $\langle\tau\rangle$ fixes $k$? i.e. is $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ equivalent to $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^{\tau^n}$ possible for some $\tau$ non-torsion? If so can such elements be characterized? The immediate observation is that, by the FTGT, if we identify $\langle\tau\rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}$ and write $[n]$ for the index $n$ subgroup, that--in the topology of $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$--necessarily $\overline{[n]}=\overline{[1]}$. I.e. the monothetic group $\overline{[1]}$ has every element is a generator. If $\overline{[1]}$ were connected, of course this would be trivial to check since the set of generators has Haar measure 1 in this case, and a finite index subgroup has positive Haar measure, and so contains a generator, but the topology here is totally disconnected so it is not easy to see one way or the other. *My TeX was not rendering properly when I wrote $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ here, so I just included it as a sidenote rather than have it look like a mess. 

By the way, Erdös's proof of Bertrand's postulate is not by induction (it depends on some results which can be proven via mathematical induction, but that's a different thing): what Erdös actually does in his proof is compare lower bounds for the central binomial coefficients $\binom{2n}{n}$ with some upper ones which he obtains by means of Legendre's formula, the Erdös-Kalmár inequality, and the assumption that there are no primes in $(n,2n]$. 

Curiously enough, the Wikipedia article adscribes the first complete proof of the theorem to Pietro Abbati Marescotti. 

This "discussion" has to do with some of the material we can find in pages 183-186 of the translation into English of the first part of E. Landau's Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (published by the Chelsea Publishing Co. in 1966). 

The preceding paragraphs have been quoted verbatim from J. Newman's The World of MATHEMATICS (Vol. I, pages 304-305) and the questions that I pose today were motivated from my recent spotting of [2]: 

Later on, I would come to the conclusion that they'd decided to disregard the first condition in the definition à la Herstein because in their examples, etc., they were to analize "euclidianness" with respect to the norm in the extension which determines an application that is even completely multiplicative. 

My example comes from algebraic geometry, specifically in the theory of $\lambda$-rings, which are used in K-theory and representation theory (and possibly other places of which I am unaware). If you look in Lecture Notes in Mathematics 308 $\lambda$-rings and the Reprsentation Theory of the Symmetric Group by Donald Knutson, on pp 27, there is a theorem which is called--quite appropriately--the "Verification Principle", and it is used to do exactly the kind of thing you're asking about. The statement is: If $\mu$ is a $\lambda$-ring operation, then $\mu$ is uniquely a polynomial in the $\lambda$-operations and for any particular polynomial $f(\lambda^1,\lambda^2,\ldots , \lambda^n,\ldots)$ it is sufficient to check that $\mu = f$, operating on a sum $\xi_1+\ldots + \xi_r$ of elements of degree 1, for all $r>0$. If you read the first part of the book (i.e. up to page 27 where you read this) you learn that this is a very handy thing indeed, especially given the generating function polynomials that show up in the study of these objects and how much easier it is to check for things which are polynomials in the $\lambda$-operations (as they are called). It is this that so nicely ties this kind of ring in with the representation theory of the symmetric group, in particular the elementary symmetric functions, as Knutson mentions on p. 10 of the same publication. Another useful technique is one that comes up in algebra, when you check something for general elements by checking on a basis. Eg. testing something for all the elements of your tensor or exterior algebra by testing it on the "pure" or "completely decomposable" tensors which form a generating set. 

I believe this answers your question, although it may not be that enlightening. Basically, you can rephrase the existence of a faithful semisimple $R$-module in category-theoretic language as follows. First, an $R$-module $M$ is faithful iff $M$ is a cogenerator in $\mbox{Mod-}R$ for the subcategory of (finitely-generated) projective modules; i.e., for every nonzero map $f : P \rightarrow P'$ between projectives $P$ and $P'$ there exists a map $g : P' \rightarrow M$ such that $gf \neq 0$. Thus the ring $R$ is semiprimitive iff $\mbox{Mod-}R$ contains a semisimple object $M$ that is a cogenerator for the subcategory of projective objects. 

Yes, any indecomposable projective-injective $A$-module $P$ is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of every tilting $A$-module $T$. Just check that $T \oplus P$ is also a tilting module, and then use the fact that any two tilting $A$-modules have the same number of isomorphism classes of idecomposable summands. 

For (4), the answer is yes. For selfinjective algebras, the condition that the syzygies are non-zero and indecomposable is automatic for non-projective indecomposable M. Thus "cool" reduces to the notion of "complexity one" in this case. It is easy to see (using the horseshoe lemma for example) that the property of a module having complexity $\leq 1$ is preserved by extensions and taking direct summands. Thus if all simples have complexity one, then so do all non-projective indecomposables. Question (3), however, is wide open. Over a selfinjective algebra, any simple module that is cool must also be periodic (at least over an algebraically closed field) [arXiv:1203.2408]. Thus (3) is equivalent to asking for a non-periodic selfinjective algebra for which every simple module is periodic. I don't know of any such example yet, and believe it may have been conjectured that none exist (but I can't find a reference to this "conjecture" at the moment). 

Last but not least, in several works of old (z.B., Perron's Die Lehre von den Kettenbrüchen, Knopp's Theory and Application of Infinite series, Khinchin's Continued Fractions), there appears the following notation for general continued fractions: $\underset{j=1}{\overset{\infty}{\LARGE\mathrm K}}\frac{a_j}{b_j}=\cfrac{a_1}{b_1+\cfrac{a_2}{b_2+\cfrac{a_3}{b_3+\ddots}}}.$ Guess what the $\mathrm{K}$ stands for...

Let $C_{c}^{r}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$ denote the set of all functions $f \colon (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{C}$ that are $r$ times differentiable and have compact support. For any $y \in (0,\infty)$ and any $f \in C_{c}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$, let $m_{y}(f) := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} y\phi(n) f(y^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function; in addition, let $m_{0}(y) := \int_{0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\right)u f(u)\, du$. In the paper Discrete measures and the Riemann hypothesis (Kodai Math. J. 17 (1994), no. 3, 596–608.), Prof. Alberto Verjovsky proved the folllowing: The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if $m_{y}(f) = m_{0}(f) + o(y^{\frac{3}{4}-\epsilon})$ as $y \to 0$ for every $f \in C_{c}^{r}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$ with $r \in [2,\infty]$ and every $\epsilon > 0$.

There is a simpler way to derive the result from the approach mentioned by K. Conrad. You can find it in the following 1997 note by Paul T.

Well it seems to me the Cauchy-Riemann equations say quite a lot. After all once you know the real and imaginary parts are harmonic, then you know their derivatives are as well, and $$f'(z)=u_x(z)+iv_x(z)$$ so you can do it again. I don't think this is boot-strapping it, but if anyone greater on the complex food-chain cares to disagree, I'm likely retreat quickly at their word. 

Fix an algebraic closure, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ for the rationals and consider the set, $B_p$, of all places of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over a fixed (possibly infinite) prime, $p$, of $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G_\mathbb{Q}=\text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. 1: Let $G_\mathbb{Q}$ act on $B_p$ in the natural way. Then what is the structure of the stabilizer, $H_v$ of $v$, for $v|p$ an element of $B_v$? Infinite primes are just embeddings of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ into $\mathbb{C}$, so the case $p=\infty$ is really asking for the stabilizer of the action of left multiplication in $G_\mathbb{Q}$, and for finite $p$ it should be the inverse limit--over finite, Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$--of the decomposition groups of primes $\mathfrak{p}|p$. However, actually getting ones hands on the structure of the stabilizers in question seems to be a hard question, at least no one I've talked to so far seems to know much more than the obvious things stated here. 2: Is is perhaps easier to describe the cosets $G/H_v$? If so, what should they look like?
