I'm trying to filter a specific device from my network. Either MAC or IP address filtering would do the trick, but I have trouble finding the exact Cisco IOS commands to use. My router is a Cisco 870 and the device is connected through wifi (if that makes a difference). I need a fairly simple setup that I can switch on and off easily. This is for development purposes and I need to simulate connectivity changes to that specific device without bothering anyone else connected to that same router. ACL seems like a way some people suggest, but I am a noob when it comes to configuring Cisco routers and don't know how exactly to work with them. Edit: The commands Kyle mentioned did not work exactly as typed, but when I ran adjusted commands below, it does not appear to work: 

I have two physical Apache servers behind a load balancer. The load balancer was supposed to be set up so that a user would always be sent to the same physical server after the first request, to preserve sessions. This worked fine for our web apps until we added SSL to the setup. Now the user can successfully login, see the home page, but clicking on any other internal links logs the user right out. I traced the issue to the fact that while initial authentication is performed by server 1, clicking on internal links leads to having the request sent to server 2. Server 2 does not share sessions with server 1, and the user is kicked out. How can I fix it? Do I need to share sessions between the two servers? If so, could you point me to a good guide for doing this? Thanks. 

This way all my outgoing traffic is departing ISP B (since it sends me more specific routes) and all my incoming traffic comes in from ISP A (it shows up as a better route on the internet). If one of the ISPs goes down, the internet will still be available through another ISP. 

I am a bit new to ASAs so far, so my question is "Is it possible to set up ASA 5515 to use 2 ISPs to have VPN connection with a remote site and in case of the main ISP's failure switch over to backup ISP automatically and then to return back to the main one when the link is reestablished ?" 

But the problem is I do not see the group name. All I get is a bunch of users. It would be nice if someone could tell me how to display the group name before all the members of this group get listed. Thanks. 

I'm setting up a freebsd router and want certain IPs on my network to be forwarded to our local webserver if they make port 80 requests. An example would be - banned user tries to surf the web, but all his requests are forwarded to the web page which notifies him that he is banned. As I understand I can use IPFW for this and maybe NATD. I would be grateful if someone could show me a good example on how to do it. 

But the trouble is that it requires you to hard code the domain www.example.com. How can I make it go to SSL version of whatever domain is actually requested, instead of hard coding it? I have seen variable getting used in portion of .htaccess, but it does not appear to work when I attempt to use it in . Tried the following and it gave me a 500 error: 

I have several subdomains served by Apache using Name-based Virtual Hosts. The way it's set up is that I have one directory holding all the site's pages, but it's accessible using several subdomains (a web application with a different theme for each customer). For each subdomain I have a symlink to the main dir, which matches the name-based virtual host mapping. So I just use $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] in my php scripts to determine which theme to serve, but the code base is the same. The problem is that the sites need to be SSL and I have trouble figuring out how to force it that way. I have seen this example for .htaccess: 

but that did not work either. Router does not give any errors, but the device can still access the network. Tips? 

I strongly recommend against having Apache run as any real user. If an exploit is found in your sites, a malicious user can read or alter your personal files. WordPress will run fine with the files being owned by your user account and with Apache running as a different user. There are a few files and paths which you should to the same group as the Apache server and make group writable. That way Apache can make the necessary changes without the risk of a user having full access to the rest of your files. You should read the WordPress document on Changing File Permissions. 

We are looking into using BtrFS on an array of SSD disks and I have been asked to verify that BtrFS does in fact perform TRIM operations upon deleting a file. So far I have been unable to verify that the TRIM command is sent to the disks. I know BtrFS is not considered production ready, but we like the bleeding edge, therefore I'm testing it. The server is Ubuntu 11.04 server 64-bit release (mkfs.btrfs version 0.19). I have installed the Linux 3.0.0 kernel as the BtrFS changelog states that bulk TRIM is not available in the kernel shipped with Ubuntu 11.04 (2.6.38). Here's my testing methodology (initially adopted from $URL$ with modifications to work with BtrFS): 

I am new to powershell, but I've been reading manuals and practiced a little bit. My objective is to List all users in all Security Groups under specified path. I have found the way to do it: 

So my question is, what is the best solution to make sure I keep the state of static NAT and stateful firewall rules (not ZBF) on both routers at the same time? Again, I want traffic to leave through ISP A and return through ISP B. Is it possible at all or do you think it would be better to purchase a pair of ASA 5500 series with Active/Active support and do NAT and inspection on them? 

Here I supply the list of IP addresses that are all alive, as you can see in previous command, but only 2 hosts out of 8 show up as alive. Can anyone explain this behavior of nmap and maybe tell the work around ? I want to use nmap in the shell script to quickly determine alive hosts. Previously I used 'fping -a' command, but nmap seems to be better at discovering hosts behind the firewall, so I would like to switch to it without modifying my script too much. Any help will be appreciated. 

One tool that you can try is sshfs (you can use this from the command line without needing a GUI). You do not need to do any setup on the server side. Connecting from the client is as simple as: 

I recently had a similar problem on a Debian Lenny box that was set to UTC when I wanted localtime. First you need to copy (or symlink) your correct zoneinfo file from to . For example I ran on my system. Second you need to edit to reflect your timezone as well. On my system, the file states . Once both of those files are taken care of, it is a good idea to restart crond to ensure the proper timezone is picked up. 

If the name for the reverse address does not match the forward address, it is likely that the name you see was the name assigned to your IP address when the IP was used by a different customer of your provider. If the name does match, you should talk to your provider and make sure something else isn't going on. If possible, please revise your question with some examples of what you're seeing. 

After reading man dhcpd.conf and playing around I've managed to achieve my goal by making the following ammendments to my dhcpd.networks file: 

I have a question about correct isc-dhcp configuration. I want to lease ip addresses to users based on switch port. For this I use DLink DES-3200 series switches. Everything works well, but recently I've decided to lease particular subnet to all unknown user, i.e. not explicitly specified in dhcpd.conf file. Here is a config example: # dhcpd.conf 

We have a couple of branch offices that need to connect to a main site. We plan to use Cisco ASAs 5515 to establish VPN connections. We would also like to have 2 ISPs at each location to make the connection redundant. Here is the image: 

At my company we have a single Cisco 3925sec/k9 router running BGP with 2 ISPs. Now we want to purchase a redundant router of the same model to eliminate a single point of failure. I can set up BGP between routers and ISPs no problems. We plan to send out all traffic through ISP A and receive all traffic through ISP B (ISPs send us only default gateways and we can play around with as-prepends and local_pref attributes for that).
