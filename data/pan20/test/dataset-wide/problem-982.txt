Due to Axial precession the Earth's axis changes direction with a period of 26,000 years as in the diagram: 

He has a paper Physical Dynamics of Ice Crystal Growth, but I don't see any discussion of theoretical maximum sizes of crystals or agglomerations. 

The IPCC said "Although the Hadley Centre climate model underestimates sea-ice extent and thickness, the trends of the two models are similar. Both models predict continued decreases in sea-ice thickness and extent (Vinnikov et al., 1999), so that by 2050, sea-ice extent is reduced to about 80% of area it covered at the mid-20th century." The graph on this IPCC page shows a predicted decline in annual average extent of about half a million km$^2$ from 2000 to now. Your monthly average graph shows a somewhat faster decline over this period. The SA article talks about the much more drastic decline in minimum (September) extent. 

A thin layer of topsoil is formed. Aerial photographs of the Spirit Dunes, Manitoba, Canada show this can happen in decades: 

I can't find any IPCC prediction of minimums, so you could say the IPCC failed to predict it or you could say it's in accord with what the IPCC did predict about annual averages. Ice volume is also declining rapidly. 

The color of the water is determined by depth and mineral composition. Calcium carbonate is carried in the Little Colorado river water column and coats the river bottom. Calcium carbonate scatters white light (aka, looks white), so combined with water, which scatters blue light, a turquoise color is formed. When the water column is thin, white scattering of the calcium carbonate is more pronounced and the color of the water is lightened. In the deeper parts of the river, the color is a darker blue due to the smaller concentration of calcium carbonate (due to more volume of water) and the increased scattering of blue light through a thicker water column. This blog has a great explanation.

The change in the shape of the resitivity over time could potentially correlate to mantle flow. This paper describes a time-lapse MT method used to monitor changes in conductivity of a geothermal system over time. Passive seismic data (sourced from earthquakes) may also be used to measure properties of the mantle, but a detailed model of mantle flow would be very difficult to build from seismic for many reasons. 

The largest database of seamounts contains over 33,000 seamounts and was created by Yesson, Chris; Clark, MR; Taylor, M; Rogers, AD. Link For their list, they defined seamounts and knolls as 

Since you're looking for a list, you could investigate each of those technologies above. However, the one instrument not mentioned above and the most high recommended method is simply using geological maps. 

They go on to say that both of these patterns "may exist". Differential extinction They probably say this best:

Source: Black Tusk, Wikimedia Commons The entire Intermontane Plate was subducted under the North American plate. However, we are able to see the remnants of the plate in the volcanic islands it left behind. Once this Intermontane Plate was subducted, the Insular Plate became the new subduction zone. This entire process was actually repeated with the Insular Plate, subducting the entire plate, leaving behind yet another chain of volcanic islands that fused to the western coast of the North American Plate. The Burke Museum has an excellent article that describes the subduction of both the Intermontane Plate and the Insular Plate. Well worth the read. 

Currently the most direct way of measuring mantle properties is using geophysics. For instance, magnetotellurics (MT) can be used to measure resitivity in the upper mantle at mid-ocean ridges: 

Recorded pressures in rock would be a very useful measurement for multiple fields of geology. There are many answers to this question that depend on different types of rocks and processes. In general though, because rocks are elastic, pressure, which is a force per unit area, will cause stress on a rock. This stress, if applied at a low temperature and pressure, will compress the rock, temporarily deforming it. When the stress is released, the rock will return to its pre-stressed state. If this stress is applied over a long period of time and at a high enough temperature and pressure, the rock will eventually deform permanently. This deformation is called strain and it can be related to stress using Hooke's law: $$ \sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} \epsilon_{kl} $$ where $\sigma$ is stress, $\epsilon$ is strain, and $C$ is the compliance tensor. We can directly measure strain on rocks using lab tests such as a tri-axial stress test with cored rock. For this test, you apply a specified uniform or directional stress to a rock and measure the strain. These tests show the empirical relationship between stress and strain for different rocks: Validhtml $URL$ source: $URL$ You asked about measuring sea level fluctuations; this type of pressure would apply a hydrostatic stress on the rocks. However, this stress would not be sufficient to cause permanent deformation in rocks. Therefore we (in O&G) generally rely on sequence stratigraphy to measure sea level fluctuations during a certain time period. Here are some basic definitions of terms I used in this answer.
