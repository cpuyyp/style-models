Strava has an API so if you all use it to log your rides, you could pull the data for each rider and do any analysis you want. There are heaps of people (including me) using the API for additional statistics and analysis. 

When I apply the front brake I can feel a "shudder" or "pulse" through the front wheel, fork and handlebars. It's faster when I'm travelling faster and slower when I'm moving slower. I assume there's something wrong with the rim, causing the brake pads to catch (rim braking, not discs). But I've checked the rim carefully and can't see anything. There isn't any ledges and I can't see that parts of the rim are wider than other parts (although I haven't checked with calipers or anything since I don't have any). It's happened since the wheels were new. They're Charge Dish wheels. I've used multiple different brake pads and they have all had this problem (to varying degrees). How can I diagnose and fix this problem? Updates based on comments: 

I think clipless pedals are definitely the way to go. With the pedals always moving under your feet, it's even more important to have your feet firmly attached as it's too easy to lose contact with the pedals otherwise. I find the first time I ride it after having ridden freewheels for a while I'll forget once or twice and get a bit of a jolt through my trailing leg to remind me to keep those pedals spinning. Also from Sheldon Brown's site: 

I also live in a Midwestern city, Chicago, and if you are riding on the sidewalk - i.e. moving at any moderate pace with legs slung over the top tube - you are in the wrong 99.99% of the time, unless you are under 12 years old. God forbid you actually hit someone on the sidewalk. I get chewed out in the hundred meters it takes to make it from the street, onto the sidewalk, and into my front door. To your question: Is it safer? Well that depends. It sounds like it's legal riding and fairly unoccupied on the sidewalks by you. In that case it may be safer. I think the bigger concern is your riding habits in general. You can't take your sidewalk riding habits with you anywhere, be it safe or not. So what happens when you realize you love to do long road rides and all you know is how to maneuver on the sidewalk? There aren't any interesting sidewalk rides I know of in the Midwest. Better to learn how to navigate in real traffic patterns on trafficked streets. That is the least common denominator in the real world - streets with traffic. You will have to get on them and in the mix at some point. It's part of riding. So, I think it will behoove you to start riding on the road as much as you can, even if it's busy. When it comes time for you to do a long group ride, it definitely wont be on the sidewalk, and you will be better prepared. In my humble opinion, those who regularly ride the streets are safer riders in general - they are better bike handlers, have better reactions, are more intimate with traffic patterns, and some (many) are even safer drivers because of it. 

I had the same dilemma and the best idea I came up with is a fixed internal gear hub. Sturmey Archer make a 3-speed fixed hub that looked the goods. The way this works is that there's still no freewheel (the same as a fixie) but there's a gear cable coming out of the hub that allows you to select between 3 gears. On the bike it looks a little like this: 

I have bullhorn bars, with a Tektro cyclocross lever and a TT style bar end lever as well, operating rim brakes. The calipers are Tektro dual pivot. The pads are cartridge style pads (I don't have the exact make and model with me right now). This is the closest photo to my setup I could find. I have bullhorn bars rather than drop bars, but it shows the way the cyclo levers interact with the bar end levers. 

I saw a sports doctor and he performed an ITB release. It was a very quick procedure peformed under local anasthetic where they partially cut the ITB, lengthening it. I walked out of the doctors and was back on the bike a few weeks. Since then I've had no trouble at all. I would really recommend discussing it with your doctor. Surgery is mentioned on wikipedia. There is more information here 

Particularly when you're learning to do a skid stop, you need to hop your back wheel off the ground momentarily and then lock your back leg while your wheel is not in contact with the road. Then when your wheel hits the road again, it will skid. You shouldn't need to jam it anywhere against your bike, I'd suggest this is probably a bit dangerous. It's good to practice on wet roads. It's much easier to get the skid started when grip is reduced. 

I don't know if the 60mm will have a higher rolling resistance than the 40mm, there are a lot of variables that can make the difference. There are tons of articles and studies on the internet that compare rolling resistance of tires. Here is one that says: 

Are there any manufacturers that make a 12-25 that is compatible with SRAM? I'd also be interested in a 12-** cassette as long as it has an 18 tooth cog. 

How often should one disassemble one's headset and service the bearings, assuming it's a fairly new road bicycle with sealed cartridge bearings and is ridden every day? 

On every helmet I've worn there is always some extra length to the straps that run through the buckle that secures the helmet to ones head. Most helmet's these days come with one or two small rubber rings or something similar in which to loop the extra length on the strap. Is there a better way to do this than the ways I've tried? The most obvious way is to simply cut the slack off but I'm not really after that. I'd like to see how others finish their helmet straps to be the most comfortable around the neck and the least intrusive. Below are pictures of: 

Along with the aforementioned supplies there are two small rubber tubes, hollow, and about 1cm long. What are these and how would one potentially use them with the patch kit? 

Update I think I'm missing a part. If you look closely at the exploded graphic from Sheldon, the compression ring has a gap in it, allowing it to shrink onto the steerer tube and hold it firmly. My compression ring is solid, so nothing can shrink and grip. Kudos to Zen as well, since he mentions that it's a wedge. I'm going to have a look around at home to see if I can find the missing bits. Otherwise a new headset should sort it. Thanks all! 

I have a Sturmey Archer 3-speed hub on an ex-single speed. I got a flat on my way to work and couldn't ride any more. So I jumped on the train and took it to the bike shop near work (the shop who fitted the hub was too far from my work) to get them to fit a new tyre and tube. They've generally seemed pretty knowledgeable and competent when I've used them in the past. When I picked it up, they'd removed the changing cable and shaft (sorry, I don't know what this is called) that triggers the gear change from the hub and when I pointed it out they didn't even think that was a problem. So I assume they aren't exactly familiar with Sturmey Archer hubs. Unfortunately when they re-fitted the axle nuts they cross threaded it. So the nut was completely stripped and now I can't properly thread a new nut onto the axle, as the thread on the axle is also damaged. My first thought is to take it back and get them to fix it. But if the fix necessitates a new axle, I don't trust them to do the work. So I guess I should ask them to pay for me to return the hub to the shop I bought it from so they can repair it, but I doubt they'll agree to that. What is a reasonable expectation? How should I proceed from here? 

Sprinter A sprinter is a type of rider who is known for explosive power and acceleration. They often have a large build, usually with massive quads and strong upper bodies. Since they are relatively heavier than other riders their speed advantage is often limited to flatter sections and they can and are often dropped in hilly terrain. Sprinters are know for drafting in the slipstream of teammates (usually the domestiques) who are sheltering them, before launching into a sprint in the final meters of a race. Some sprinters are stronger in hillier terrain and cobblestones, and are sometimes categorized to be Puncheurs. They often excel in the classics races. Mark Cavendish 

The reliability depends on the quality of the brifter itself but, for most brifters, all you need to maintain, adjust, and them and keep them in good working condition is a hex key set, some spray degreaser, and a high quality grease. I use mostly sram brifters and they just work when they are set up right. To keep them in good working order I remove the hoods and blast out the internals with degreaser, working the levers into different shifting positions until everything is clean and working smoothly. After they are dry I apply some high quality grease with a small brush to the mechanical parts inside, and then put the hoods back on. Extremely simple maintenance. Not fussy at all. I'm not sure why some competitive cyclists are that are telling you brifters are so unreliable, but, they are wrong. I believe 100% of the tour riders rode some sort of brifter in 2015. These are the cyclists who demand the utmost durability and certainly wouldn't use brifters if they were inherently flawed or fussy somehow. But, like any part, if they are low quality to begin with they will require more maintenance and will tend to be less reliable. 

Lock both front and rear brakes Walk backwards, resulting in the bike being vertical in front of you, with you standing behind it holding the handlebars Feathering the rear brake, manoeuvre the bike in location below the hook. The seat should be just in front of your knee or lower thigh Put one knee/thigh on the seat and flex that leg at the hip, raising your knee. This lifts your bike vertically with almost no effort required. Place it on the hook and you're done! 

I have bought a second hand bike and generally it's going well. However, there is a small amount of play in the headset that I've been trying to diagnose and resolve. It's a threadless fork. I've adjusted the tension by loosening the headstem bolts and tightening the top cap. I tighten it up a lot and this reduces the play a little, but when I brake hard or hit a bump I still get the 'clonk' as it moves to the limit of it's adjustability. I've used this article on Sheldon Brown for the terminology I use below, particularly this photo: 

I don't think you have a problem here. Physiologically, your thighs are the engine room of your legs. They are designed for endurance and power and can keep working at a high output for extended periods of time. Your calves are more for short bursts of power, such as jumping or sprinting. They can't sustain high power output for any length of time. In distance cycling, your calves should be fairly passive. Attempting to work them harder will probably just result in fatigue and injuries. 

I started using aluminum rollers to ride indoors this winter and noticed streaks left on the tires. I've also seen tires specifically advertised for use with rollers. I'm wondering whether using the rollers will tear up or degrade a high quality road tire in any way? 

You cannot use a GXP bottom bracket to "fit it all together". BB30 cranks do not fit in a GXP bottom bracket. A GXP crank can be made to fit a BB30 bottom bracket with an adapter, like one from Praxis. If your Orbea is a GXP standard (24mm) the cranks are no good to you as they will not fit. If it's a BB30 they will work without the need for any type of GXP bottom bracket. 

I had a 160mm disc rotor on a road bike that was rubbing a bit in one spot, not severely, but enough for me to notice. I've tried to true it a few times over the past couple months with little improvement. I finally ordered a new rotor (sram centerline) and noticed it's also touching the pad, possibly more so than the old, but it sounds better under hard braking oddly enough. I checked the new rotor before I put it on and it was straight. I'm wondering if my hub is just imperfect and that's whats causing the alignment issue. Is this common and if so is there a fix?
