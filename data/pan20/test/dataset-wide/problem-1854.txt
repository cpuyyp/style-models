First of all, check what is the company policy for applicants. Some companies do not allow multiple applications, for the sake of reducing load on HR (in big companies each HR can receive hundreds of CV in a day, do not expect them to do your job of matching CV and positions for you). If the company has no policy forbidding multiple applications, I would still advice you to narrow down your selection in any case. Multiple applications can convey the message your simply firing in the group or that you are indecisive, and you don't want to be labeled as the serial applicant. Set some criteria to evaluate the position, rank them and go for the top one. 

Unless you work for some government intelligence agency, your employer has no control rights on your private life. This means you can meet whoever you want outside office hours and talk about any topic you want, as long as you don't disclose sensitive information to any other person. If the person should ask you about job, stay high level and don't tell more info than what you know has been made public on mass media. Avoid sharing office gossip or other organizational info, like managers who changed position or department reorganizations. 

If you're applying for a job, look if the job advertisement asks for your expected salary (most do). If it doesn't, don't mention it in your application. If it does, aim a bit higher than you'd like to get to have some leeway for negotiations. It is also OK to provide a span (e.g. 45-47.000â‚¬), as long as it's not too broad (so it doesn't look clueless). If the job advertisement provides too few information, you can say you'd to discuss your expected salary in person. In the interview they will insist on you telling your expectation first (except public services, where salaries are often fixed). It's common to aim a bit higher than you really want. Especially smaller companies might ask what they could offer you instead of money (to pay you less ;-)). 

Any employee could point out certain issues together with the expected benefits he/she could solve. It seems you and your coworkers have tried that already. He seems maybe receptive to the tax guy or the lawyer. Maybe one of you could get them to help him understanding his problems. This works probably only well if one of you knows them already. Be careful not to look look like you're plotting. Get someone to talk to him in private. This could be you or one of your colleagues who is close enough to him. Tell him how you worry about him and offer some open help. Maybe one can get him to open up a bit and being more receptive for help. Does anyone in the company have common friends with your boss? Someone who could mediate? Be careful as bringing personal relations in such a conflict could harm them. You and your coworkers could chose one of you to talk to your boss in order of all employees. If possible, some coworker who is close to him would be good. This way you could try to solve some of the problems as well as to get some information what ''really'' happens. If all fails, a written petition of all employees addressing the main problems could help, although it's quite harsh because it's written. 

What I think you misunderstand is working knowledge versus book knowledge. When someone says "Do you know (insert a language) well?" he doesn't mean "Have you memorized every bit of documentation, know all the overloads of every function etc.". They usually mean "Can you look at the code and easily (identify flaws/introduce changes/fix bugs/refactor/etc.)? Can you make an informed decision on what tools to use for a given scenario? Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages of proposed solutions?". Many languages are nearly identical in the general idea: syntax may be different, a few concepts done differently and some of the caveats are unique to a language, but if you know for example C# well, you would have little trouble if someone asked you to do something in Java. You need to keep your knowledge current: again, it doesn't mean that if a new framework comes out, you need to know it by heart in the next week - but the knowledge that such a framework exists, what are it's advantages over competing solutions, what scenario would that framework be used in and in what scenarios it shouldn't be used etc. That's, in my understanding, keeping your knowledge current. If on top of that you can type the code without the use of any aid such as documentation, more power to you - but do remember that it's not the main thing. Knowing a solution is ok. Knowing there are 10 possible solutions, their strengths and weaknesses, where to find their implementation - that's even better. It is possible to find a job with what you know so far - albeit it will probably will not be a job of your dreams. You should however strive to find a job that offers you: 

Goes along well with stating you agree with him. Stating that you are not contradicting him is a rather convolute way to express "I agree with you" and can surely take longer to be understood. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...". 

It simply says that you check your mailbox on Sunday. Executives in most of the companies are not bound to Monday-Friday 9-17 work schedule, so I think it is normal for them to send mail whenever they feel like doing it. It's up to you to set the boundaries on how you deal with those mails. You don't mention the executive ever pointed out a delayed answer to weekend mail, so it's not a big deal. 

The ethics would require that you get paid for what you have done. If you are faster than the average, increase your hourly rate so that the end payment is comparable. But do this before accepting a task. Doing it afterwards will only put you under a bad light. 

If you yawned once, covered your mouth and apologized, it's no big deal. If you do it continuously, you send a message that a) your interviewer is boring you b) you didn't think the interview was important enough to get a good night's sleep. Stretching your arms has the same connotation. As for their reply, there's pretty much no point in continuing, because it's either a genuine concern of theirs, or "random excuse #27" to not hire you. Either way, move on, try to suppress those behaviors and good luck on your job hunt. 

I interviewed in places where my prospective boss's tie was probably worth more than my car. I also interviewed in places where, if I hadn't known it's a job interview, I would think I accidentally walked in on high-school party. Never once I had dressed in anything less than a full suit with a tie. No matter what you think about the company, it's image etc., by dressing in a formal attire you show respect - after all, it's a meeting between two strangers with the intent to discuss business - appropriate clothing shows that you care about the interview and that you were willing to take time to prepare. 

I want to end with a statement that may be true only in my region (Eastern Europe): When it comes to job offer "requirements" section, you can often come across postings that seems to require you to be a combination of embedded programmer, web designer, application architect, mobile developer, database administrator and it wouldn't hurt if you would be a sysadmin also. Don't be disheartened by those offers, many times people writing them just copy-paste whatever google returned as "smart sounding programming words". If the job description sounds interesting to you, apply and assess the job-offer personally - ideally after an interview with someone "technical" 

Normally not. Whenever I have searched for a high-tech job in the Netherlands I was almost never asked for reference letters. Normally you are required a CV/resume and a cover letter, sometimes a list of exam with grades, but reference letters is not really requested as common practice. 

Whoever will handle your resume will only care of one thing: can he/she open the file to read it? As long as you send your resume in a format that is well known you should not really be worried about the editor you use. Also note that most online forms for applications allow you to attach a variety of file formats, among which .pdf is always present. Things might be a little different for a limited set of positions (i.e. Apple is known for "convincing" their employee to use only and always Apple devices, so I am not sure how a Word file would be perceived there). 

I have had colleagues in the Netherlands who changed job while being in therapy for burn out or other serious health conditions. As far as I know, it's not something that will prevent you from getting a job, as long as you are open about it with your employer. You may ask your doctor advices on how to handle it with your employer (he/she will surely have other patients in the same condition). Maybe you can settle to start working part time (0.6 or 0.8 FTE) and then gradually increasing your work load as your health situation improves. 

This sounds strange, as he's keeping employees out from company business. I see three possible reasons (my interpretation, more than one could apply): 

Actually, that means "not yet" if nothing changes. Moreover, this answer shows that he's actually thinking about this possibility. 

I've had several interviews yet, and about half of them had two interview phases, where in the first one they'd like get the best candidates for the second round. Salary is addressed briefly in the first interview to check if it could work, more detailed discussion would follow in the second interview. After the second round, they'll make an offer to their favorite candidate. 

Panick: He is not able to delegate or provide access to company resources because in his view there is "no time" for that, and he's probably to stressed out to even think about it. That he doesn't sleep would make this even worse. Hiding something: If he would provide more access, employees would gain information of something he doesn't want to (e.g. bad economic situation, troubles with partners,...). Trust issues: In this case, he would believe that the only way things could work are those he does on his own (or even worse, employees could harm him). 

Did anything special happen five month ago? E.g. a project gone wrong, trouble of some coworker with the boss, trouble with partners? Lawsuits? It's strange that the change happened. What you (and you coworkers) could do It seems as is there an underlying problem you (and your coworkers) do not know of. It might be easier if you knew it, but by now you have only what you can observe. 

hinting this to most of the prospective employer sounds to them like a "hey, change your entire Excel based workflow just to accommodate for my brilliant capacity with MatLab!". Together with soft skills you may lack or need to develop (as suggested in other answers), they need to be convinced that you fit in their organization, not that their organization can easily adapt to your way of working. And don't forget, of course, that there can be other candidates more qualified than you. 

I assume you can backup your story with evidence of the surgeries and health issue. So, in the remote case that they should ask questions and your former manager should have somehow badmouthed you, it's his word against your paper evidence. I see no big deal. Relax and just take as lesson learned for the next time. 

I have been in your same situation. While working in a small start up as tester, I have found a major bug in their code just one month before a fair where they wanted to present it. The bug was so severe that all the work done in the 4 months before to validate the software was just garbage. The CEO/manager blamed me in front of all the colleagues for the thing, and claimed I was being too slow in reprocessing the data (even though he said I was 25% faster than the previous tester), and pushed me to come earlier, leave later and even skip lunch breaks (at least 10 hours/day). Long story short, after few months I took the decision to quit that job and with no regrets started looking for a better position. But what helped while I was still engaged in the job and had to get through every single day was seeking (and finding) support from my colleagues. During our lunch breaks we usually had a fair share of "discussion" on the actions of the "pointy haired boss", which basically became the subject of our jokes. After building up this solidarity among us, we managed to stitch to the 8 hours/day, by leaving all when the 8 hours were due. To answer your question: try to build a safety net with your colleagues, share the burden and let out some of the stress. Meanwhile keep searching and be confident in your skills. 

An opportunity to apply your current skills in a real-world scenario An opportunity to learn the use of other skills, preferably from someone more senior than you. And i don't mean only strict technical abilities - so called "soft-skills" are just as important. Many developers starting their careers dismiss the idea that communication, understanding of business requirements, negotiation, assessing time-and-money investments required and simillar are necessary for their career growth. Don't make that mistake. 

I know there are many questions about the dreaded "other duties as assigned" clause in most contracts. Mine has one as well. However, I feel the task assigned to me goes way off what would be expected of someone in my profession. I was recently assigned with developing a process which requires extensive legal and finance knowledge - something I'm not even remotely qualified to do (I'm a software developer). Of course, the logical step would be to ask the legal and finance team for help - they, however, refuse (or are not interested) to provide help. I communicated this to my manager, and his response was basically "I don't care how, do it". Now, I don't have the authority to make the knowledgable folks help me - what are my options in this situation? Am I in the "set sail for fail" kind of situation?
