In fleshing out the traditional definition of omniscience, William Lane Craig distinguishes between propositional knowledge and non-propositional knowledge, claiming that to be omniscient is to know every true proposition and not believe any false ones. He goes on to explain that God also possesses all appropriate self-knowledge, but that being non-propositional in nature, this is a bonus which is not essential to omniscience. $URL$ To illustrate this distinction, he compares the sentence "I have been treed by a moose" with "Bill has been treed by a moose," concluding that although they express the same proposition, the latter sentence must be conjoined with "I am Bill" in order for it to play the same role as the former sentence in influencing behavior. The claim is that the sentence "I am Bill" is not propositional knowledge, but a sort of non-propositional self-knowledge. This is the part I don't understand. Firstly, I don't even understand why this distinction is helpful in its context. Dr. Craig's goal appears to be clarifying that omniscience is normally understood in terms of propositional knowledge, and that therefore God does not need to possess all self-knowledge in order to be omniscient, thus deflecting any objection to omniscience based on the incoherence of God possessing the knowledge, i.e., "I am Napoleon." The problem is that even without this distinction, I can't see how "I am Napoleon" would be anything more than a false proposition when expressed from the perspective of God, which shouldn't do anything to scratch Craig's picture of God's omniscience, despite his claim, "But God doesn’t have the self-knowledge that, say, Napoleon does, in that God doesn’t believe that he is Napoleon. God doesn’t believe that he is Ronald Reagan. God knows that he is God. That is why I said that what God possesses is appropriate self-knowledge. To have all self-knowledge would be a cognitive dysfunction, not an excellence. God would be literally schizophrenic and would hold false beliefs if God thought that he were Ronald Reagan or Napoleon." If this self-knowledge was propositional in nature, God would simply not believe such propositions (and believe their negations), since they're false. Why should this be any different from God knowing "the average lifespan of a human is 5000 years" to be false? Furthermore, even if "I am Napoleon" is not a proposition, surely "I am Napoleon or married bachelors exist" is a proposition, so wouldn't this self-knowledge still turn out to be implicitly essential to omniscience? But the deeper question is how saying this self-knowledge is non-propositional even makes sense. "I am Bill" has a truth value, when expressed from some perspective that satisfies the indexical, just as the uncontroversially propositional sentence, "I have been treed by a moose" does. Granting that "God [...] would hold false beliefs if God thought that he were Ronald Reagan or Napoleon" makes it clear that "I am Ronald Reagan" and "I am Napoleon" have truth values, and isn't that sufficient for their being propositions? I was able to find some information on non-propositional knowledge under the label "knowledge-how," but this seems to be quite a different animal. $URL$ Knowledge-how refers to experiential knowledge proposed to be "irreducibly complex." Perhaps how to play the flute cannot be broken down into propositions, but this type of knowledge isn't true or false. This seems quite different from self-knowledge, instances of which actually make sense to associate with truth values. What is the correct way to conceive of self-knowledge in relation to propositions/propositional knowledge? 

I don't even see how the argument here is supposed to work logically. I wouldn't say that infinity "must exist" otherwise maths wouldn't work. I think this is a common idea to people who are mathematical Platonists, believing that all mathematical objects "exist" in some "other world." I don't think that's a necessarily bad way to talk about it, but it does lead to problems like this which don't even arise outside of that view of mathematics. The invention vs discovery debate in maths is also part of these questions. I would go more towards the ideas of infinity and the way real and complex analysis deals with it is ingenious, but is an especially good creation. I don't think "infinity" refers to an object like "chair" does. So saying "infinity exists for all countables" is, to me, not really saying anything. What does it mean? If you mean it to say, e.g. that there is no biggest natural number, no biggest rational, etc, that's fine. That's different to imagining this object called infinity which exists in some metaphysical world. Infinite time must exist - what does that mean? I don't know. Do you mean to say that there is something "out there" which corresponds to that label "infinite time"? Or more that time will keep going? I don't think it's meaningful to talk about proving infinity exists any more than it is meaningful to be able to prove negative numbers, rationals, complex numbers, etc exist. Would you say that quaternions must exist? Or instead that they're just a useful way of looking at and doing mathematics? Time being countable and therefore of infinite value? What does that mean? What does it mean to assign a value to time? Countable sets don't necessarily have an infinite number of elements. Also, what does it even mean to say time is a countable set? What are you taking as its elements? Like a set of values for t? 

To a certain extent, it is difficult to fully adhere to Wittgenstein's views and continue working in academic philosophy, as, if you agree with him, most of the major debates are settled so there's not that much left to write about. It's a bit like whack a mole - every now and then a new philosophical puzzle will surface, and you will have to address it, but the main big picture arguments are settled. For example, after writing PI, Wittgenstein didn't completely stop doing philosophy. He wrote On Certainty afterwards. What PI managed to do however, is to free himself in a way, to offer him a way to stop doing philosophy when he wanted to. To understand this I think you need to understand how Wittgenstein's found his own philosophical problems distressing. I believe writing PI allowed him to let go of a lot of the big problems which previously had distressed him - he was able to see where he went wrong, and he no longer asks the same questions. It is kind of a given that most people working in academic philosophy would not agree with Wittgenstein as they are actively working in areas that Wittgenstein followers believe is already settled. So mainstream philosophers on the whole do not believe he solved all the problems, as they are working philosophers so they're working on problems they believe are unsolved. That said, I have put a lot of time into reading Wittgenstein's various works and reading supporting academic literature, and I find his works very convincing, in comparison to any other philosopher I've read. I'm writing this while on the way to somewhere else, so forgive me for the lack of citations, although I would be free to provide sources if you have any questions. 

Given a flavor of nominalism which denies that simple sentences and existential quantifiers referring to mathematical objects are literally true (pretense theory, fictionalism, figuralism, etc.), suppose there is a circle, C. According to my understanding, either of the propositions "the radius of C is 3 feet" or "the area of C is 5 square feet" could be literally true, since "3" and "5" only serve to specify the cardinality of "feet" and "square feet," and are not purported to imply the real existence of "3" or "5." Now, when we combine these two propositions, does an actual contradiction technically arise, or would we move into the realm of pretense/fiction/figurativ-ity when stating the two propositions in terms of the same units (likely square feet) since the units would be canceled out? We would assess the compatibility of the propositions by setting them equal to one another: area = pi * radius^2 5 square feet = pi * (3 feet)^2 5 square feet = pi * 9 square feet 5 = pi * 9 5 = 28.2743... (false) My question is, since the units were canceled out by the time we arrived at an explicit contradiction (we might say they were paraphrased away when we thought about the propositions in their most reduced form), did we lose the ability to say that these propositions are contradictory on these various nominalist views? 

I was considering a solution to the omnipotence paradox in which excluding logical impossibilities from the definition of omnipotence is justified as follows. Consider the proposition, "God could create a round triangle" (add additional qualifiers, here and to the solution, if you feel there is not a true contradiction). If we don't want to say such a statement is true, which most theists do not, we must ask why it's not true. It seems the proposition can be divided into in three parts: 1) If X exists, it is round 2) If X exists, it is a triangle 3) God could cause X to exist. The proposition can be sensibly said not to affect the definition of omnipotence because it is the conjunction of 1 and 2 that cannot be true. A round triangle is not a "thing." The problem has nothing to do with the truth value of 3. Perhaps we could paraphrase by saying it's not the instantiation of a round triangle that causes the problem, but the mere concept of a round triangle. What I'm curious about is whether such a solution to omnipotence paradoxes carries any weight at all on Meinongian views. Would a round triangle, a married bachelor, or a stone too heavy for God to move exist in Meinong's Jungle? If so, is there any reason such things could not "exist in the world," so to speak, aside from God's inability to instantiate them? 

I'm not aware of a term for this, although in law, the "but for" test is actually used as an argument to show that someone was negligent. See more here: $URL$ I agree it's clearly flawed 

Just because a question looks grammatical on the surface does not make it an appropriate question to ask. You use "why" in circumstances where you can try to suppose some reason for something - like "why do people with diabetes get eye problems". " Why do I exist?" - the practical answer is because your parents had you, because you have a brain, etc. But that's obviously not what you are talking about, you're going for the philosophical question. But can you even conceive of a kind of answer that could satisfy you? What would an answer to that question even look like? I don't think the solution to the question lies in an answer either way, but instead looking at the motivation for the question, seeing how the question may be doomed for the start because it puts a "why do" next to "I exist". 

As you say, similarity in and of itself isn't the important thing (Hitler breathing air) but instead the fact that is similar to one of the actions or ideas we collectively agree were bad (invading other countries, gassing Jews, etc). The idea that you've failed in an argument when you bring up Hitler isn't a logical one, it's just to do with what is considered good and bad rhetoric. There are many places where the comparison could be useful, but often the comparison is fairly weak (left vs right politicians calling the other side "literally Nazis") which has led to it the comparison being diluted in its rhetorical effect 

What do you mean by "know" and "feel"? I'm sure you've happily used the word " know" in places where you weren't talking about things you were feeling directly. Do you doubt that your friend's feet are sore after a marathon, just because you can't feel their pain? It kind of sounds like the idea of sense-data to me that was popular around Russell's time. Like " I can't be sure that I am really looking at a football at the moment, but I can be sure that I am perceiving the sense data which looks like one" (like seeing these various colours in my visual field). Thus I should, to be correct, in future, say "I see the sense data of a car" instead of "I see a car". To me, it's just a useless change in notation, where the phrase " I see the sense data appearing to be X" will take on the role of " I see X". 

This is a quote that is probably easily misunderstood. He goes quite in depth about this in the Blue and Brown books. Wittgenstein was trying to sort out the muddle he thought was present in the way people thought about thinking. He was trying to argue against essentialism when it comes to meaning. A lot of people previously were trying to identify the common essence to all the thinks we call "thoughts" or "thinking", or any other words for that matter (truth, justice and so on). Philosophers looking at writing might have said something like : "When I write, I deliberately put the pen on the page, I think about what to say, and then move my hand to write what I had thought of" Wittgenstein then moves to disagree that when you write you are always "thinking" in the way people assume. He says that there are many different things that could be happening when you write, depending on the situation. You could be signing your name, which doesn't involve any reflection, you could be writing a mathematic proof, where each line you think about in great depth. You could be hesitating while trying to sign a contract, you could be transcribing notes from a blackboard to a copy, you could simply start writing random words. There are a host of different things we call writing, and we forget about this when we assume there is this peculiar presence of a "thought" every time we write. This is partly what he is referring to in his comment - that many times when we write and speak, we do so instinctively, or we do so without picturing anything in our mind.
