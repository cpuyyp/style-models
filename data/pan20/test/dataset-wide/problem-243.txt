The theory of Late Heavy Bombardment says that approximately 4 billions of years ago, something disturbed the orbits of asteroids in the Kuiper belt, which caused extremely heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. This probably brought many heavy elements to Earth's surface. The heavy elements that were here previously, during the Earth's formation, sank to the core when the Earth was liquid which made them out of reach. In other words, if there was no Late Heavy Bombardment, the surface of Earth might have been almost without elements much heavier than silicon. (Iron, gold, silver, platinum and others would be extremely rare.) My question: If humans developed the same way they did, what kind of technology would be achievable almost without elements much heavier than silicon? 

I am trying to estimate how much calories is available in form of plants to mammal herbivores per square meter per year in optimal conditions. By optimal conditions I mean that the climate is temperate, with enough water and sun for most of the year. By other words: how much food does the photosynthesis produce? 

The shortest documented adult ever became only 54.6cm (21.5"). Even though this is quite small, I'd say it is definitely way too large to be able to fly with (butter)fly wings. I could rather imagine bird or bat wings. I also assume you cannot simply gain a human in a form as tiny as one wants to imagine as many of our organs probably have a limited minimum size to function properly. You'd have to change the internal body massively and throw out anything not absolutely necessary. Also they'd probably not as slim but rather have a stocky body and a quite oversized head. Retaining human intelligence with a brain a fraction of the size of ours is hardly possible. They may have a slightly improved efficiency but barely anywhere close to human intelligence. Also a more efficient brain would raise the demand of energy so they'd have to eat and sleep very much. In addition to the high energy demand for their flying ability I'd say that's a very limiting factor. As for your last question, that's a matter of supply and demand. Since human teeth are like ivory to them they create jewelry from, less people believing in fairies mean less teeth and thus higher value per tooth. The much more important question is: why would such a creature develop? Did they develop out of a hominid or an insect, and why would it shrink and develop full wings but not change anything else (or vice versa, why would it change its body into the human form)? The human body has specialized to living on the ground and it's obviously totally ineffective and useless if it was able to fly. 

A Snakebot that is perfectly cylindrical would have a surface area of about 28 million square meters. Let's round down to 20 because cones. Metals have a heat flux coefficient of maybe 5-8 watts per m^2 K. It's about 70 K above background, or about 10 GW dumped to atmosphere all the time. Thunderstorm scientists measure air energy in CAPE, which is complex to calculate but is about 5000 J/m^3 at worst. Over my head today it's about 300 J/kg. A microcell thunderstorm is about ten kilometers on every side, and heating that much air would take ~days. In sum: It could trigger rain if rain was in the forecast, but it can't cause rain on its own. 

Okay, so skip the active nuclear reactor here. It's too hot, too big, and too heavy. Think RTG. In fact, let's think Cesium-137. A beta emitter that produces gamma radiation from it's barium daughter nuclide, Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years and is soluble in water. Beta radiation is pretty easily absorbed, and there are fungi that eat gamma rays, in fact specifically Cs-137 gamma rays. So imagine a dragon that piles U-235 bricks in a big water bath, letting it get to just barely subcritical. The accelerated fission produces loads of cesium-127 as a decay product. Your dragon drinks this boiling radioactive water and secretes the cesium into an internal organ ringed with pads of melanized tissue that eat the gamma radiation as if it were sunlight. Presto radio, a 60 year meal. Filling! Perhaps instead of constructing primitive fission reactors it precipitates uranium as crystals just under the skin, in its scales. High-energy neutrons from interstellar radiation catalyze fission very slowly, enriching the scales with cesium-137. The scales slowly migrate, displaced by new scales laid down. When they're 'aged' into energetic deliciousness, they're broken down and the cesium 'eaten'. You could also just use bricks of U-237 or strontium-90, a thermocouple, and fix carbon dioxide into food directly from electricity. It's less cool but is way simpler. 

Representation of the torus by massive points. The torus is in fact elliptical. Then, I included a centrifugal force potential and I was looking for surface of constant potential, which would enclose the massive points and which could represent the surface of the planet. At the surface, I calculated the force field. 

One possible approach how to estimate extend of space colonization is to define costs of it and then estimate the investments the governments and organizations would be willing to pay. In an excellent analysis of starship costs on the Rocketpunk Manifesto blog, the author shows that currently, the cost of building the International Space Station is \$170 millions per metric ton, and if we are very, very optimistic, the building price of space ships could be comparable to building price of a modern airplane, approximately \$1.2 millions per metric ton. My question is: What is a reasonable estimate of building price and annual maintenance cost of a long-term working colony on a planet without breathable atmosphere, like Moon or Mars, per metric ton of the colony mass? What is a reasonably optimistic estimate how low could these prices fall once the technology is established? Do not include the transport costs, only the costs of building the colony itself. 

In higher civilizations low class people had to fulfill physical work often in the outside, thus being in the sun all day tanning their skin. On the contrary high class people often stayed inside their houses doing more management work and a lot of delegating physical work to their subjects, hence the brighter skin due to a lack of exposure to the sun. That's also where the term blue-blooded originates from, the blue veins shimmer through the untanned skin. Personally I thought this philosophy originated in medieval europe but the concept could be easily transferred to earlier civilizations. As far as I know this has been the idea inside europe's civilization as well, which weakens the argument of caucasians conquering and colonizing the world as the main reason. No doubt, though, colonization did play a role in many non-european cultures but as said, later on in history. 

It only causes harm to the human body if the body is part of a closed circuit, otherwise electricity won't even move through the body. The effects on your body depend on whether it's AC or DC traversing through. The former causes the heart to try to adapt to the oscillation and a frequency of 50Hz may already cause ventricular fibrillation or even cardiac arrest with an increasing chance on higher frequencies. Also it can cause paralyzation on your muscles if the electricity is high enough. The latter may cause electrolysis in your body, which results in a sepsis that causes your death few days later. The mentioned effects both depend on the amount of electricity as well as the impact duration with both values rising the chance on increase. 50V AC and 120V DC are said to be perilous to the human body. Both types of electricity cause burns on your skin and your flesh. The shorter the distance the electricity covers through the body the smaller the resistance and thus the smaller the voltage. As your legs are usually the exit point to the ground hits on your legs are less violative than hits on your arms. It gets worse when your heart or brain are within the path. The resistance is composed of the resistance of your body and the transition resistances of the entry and exit point. Dry skin has a higher resistance so seemingly unintuitive being wet and sweaty reduces the voltage and thus the damage to the body. Defending a river might be a much more desirable point of defence. Just shoot in the water when the enemy tries to cross it. Bullets lose acceleration very quickly in water so they become quite harmless. Electricity does have a very high drop-off ratio in water (which is why a lightning hitting a lake doesn't kill all its fish) but on close distance it would be devastating. 

Alternative viewpoint: Maybe we shouldn't assert that behavior of aliens is in all situations so different from ours. Aliens, if they are evolved creatures like us, probably evolved their psychology to best serve evolution strategy they need. We can notice that dogs, for example, behave not so differently from us. Probably because they are pack animals, same as we are. Cats on the other hand, are solitary predators, and they may be quite inscrutable - their evolutionary strategy is different than ours. There is interesting (although very speculative) hypothesis how our psychology and morality is shaped by our evolutionary origins. It is called Moral Foundations Theory (more here and here). It assumes that morality of almost any society of humans contains elements of five pillars, which have quite clear evolutionary origin: 

Imagine a world in which technology we would probably call "technological singularity" is possible and already happened on few places of the galaxy. By the singularity I do not mean that anything is possible, but rather that original biological species transform themselves into extremely highly intelligent computer programs with big amount of control of their environment, and they completely transcend their biological nature. The post-singularity societies might rebuild planets to giant computers or even create Matrioshka brains, since the main scarce resources are computer time and memory. It would be relatively easy for such civilization to send spaceships that would transform all solar systems in our galaxy into computers and utilize them. It would be even easy for a small splinter faction inside such civilization, unless the "official forces" actively prevent it. The motivation is simply a lot of resources and freedom to gain. My question is: Are there plausible reasons that would prevent it and keep the civilizations bound to their home star systems? If there is such, the reason should be strong and valid for all such civilizations. If nine out of ten civilizations decide not to spread, and one does, the galaxy will still be transformed. 

First: What would such a plant look like? Think pinecone. Pinecones are designed to open up after a forest fire and exploit all the nutrients and space that was just opened up by all that fire. So let's imagine a dry coniferous forest with pretty dense, spindly, resinous undergrowth so it burns hot and fast and completely. Weathering the fire isn't really an option. A closed container filled with oxidizers(nitrates or maybe phosphates or even acetone peroxide) and simple fats or sugars (note: this is expensive in terms of nitrogen, but given the time between fires this may be worth it for the plant) hangs off the plant. Maybe it drops off when warmed. Come firetime, the heat from the blaze sets off the explosive and the seeds are fired every which way as shrapnel. Some will pass through the blaze and land safely in the already-burned area. Some will not. C'est la vie. Natural selection should ensure fairly slow detonation speeds and fairly large seed shrapnels for more distance. Grow yourself an orchard and manually select the best trees for more explosive power and larger fruits. In terms of warfare: Who knows. Grenades would be really easy to invent? 

Imagine there is a country in which there are all important natural resources (oil, gas, metal ores, wood, etc.) in their natural form and which lies in a temperate climate region. There may be some portion of a sea. The country is completely isolated from the rest of the world - nothing (except for air, precipitation, etc.) can get in or out. What is the minimum population and size of the country to sustain a developed industrial society? (All the technology used there has to be produced somewhere in the country eventually.) The technology level is current. (Year 2014, realistic technologies that can be mass-produced with reasonable cost.) By other words: What is the minimum amount of people and land to produce self-sustained agriculture and all relevant factories that are necessary for complete self sufficiency in industry from mining all ores to producing the final devices? Consider that people need to be educated and not all are geniuses that can be educated to the cutting-edge technology expert levels. EDIT: You can assume the technology is initially present, it does not have to be invented, but next generation must be able to learn it and understand it. (For example people have a very good library, or computer database, as long as the computers are running.) 

I would actually not take video games as a reference, especially not ones focusing on action. Historically spears started out as mainly single handed weapons but in a much shorter fashion probably somewhere in Africa. As different cultures evolved them to be longer for the advantage of greater distance especially agains cavalry they also became harder to handle. For the right balance and accurate control infantry started using them with both hands. The single hand usability actually differs from the weapons length and balance. Greek hoplite used a long spear single handedly in combination with a shield as seen in the movie Troy. For a compromise between balance and protection their shields had an indentation to rest the spear on, basically as a weaker second hand to lower the negative effects of the single hand use but it was probably still less easily controllable. I honestly do think the use of a long dual hand spear as a single hand weapon is anything but beneficial. Even the advantage of close distance combat with a dagger or short sword would probably not outweigh the loss of control of your main weapon. With the right shield that lowers the negative effects like explained earlier it can work but other than that, I'd rather take distance from such an approach. 

Please note that the prefactor $6 × 10^{10}$ currently used on Wikipedia is very probably wrong, so I provided a more realistic one. (See the discussion.) The tidal locking is approximately exponential process, so it is very quick at the beginning and gradually slows down. Typical situation is, that planets in the habitable zone are tidally locked for red dwarf stars. Moons are very often tidally locked, unless they are very far from their planet. 

To some extent, you can create your own star system also in Space Engine. It has beatiful graphics, it allows you to make videos or photos from the surfaces of planets in various angles, but it is not so interactive as the Universe Sandbox. This basically means that you have to input the parameters in text format and you cannot just add them by clicking. The Space Engine is free. I have also heard that AstroSynthesis is quite good, but I have no experience with it myself. 

With these assumptions, we can calculate how does the portal behave now. If previously, we calculated the difference in potential $\Delta \Phi = g h$, now this difference is reduced by the potential gain inside the portal equal to $a_g L$. So we have $$ \Delta \Phi=gh - a_g L\;. $$ With this assumption, now have to update the formula for $m_f$ to $$ m_f=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G}\;, $$ which leads to $$ a_g=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G} \cdot \frac{G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ By solving these two equations, we obtain the final formulas $$ \begin{align} a_g &= \frac{2 d g h}{2 d L+r_g^2}\;,\\ m_f &= \frac{2 d g h r_g^2}{2 d G L+G r_g^2}\;. \end{align} $$ As we can see, with large inner length $L$, the forces near the portals can be made arbitrarily small. It is still true that if you are going from the lower portal mouth to the higher one, you are going "uphill" and you must exert work. How does it look inside the portal? Interestingly, there would be no walls. The space wraps into itself, so it looks like if you are standing between four mirrors: all around, there are images of yourself and of other things inside the portal, just they are not images, but they are really there. You could see your own back. Conservation of Momentum The solution above conserves the energy properly. However, the energy is not the only thing that should be conserved. There is also momentum. With momentum, I do not have any nice idea how to put it into equations. But similarly to the previous case, I guess there would be forces acting on any entering object that change its momentum as it is passing through the portal. The forces would act both on the passing object and on the portal gates. If it is easier to rotate the portal gate so that the object would not change its direction of motion (yes, it could be easy - the portal gates could have negligible inertial mass), they would rotate to a proper position. If they are somehow fixed, the passing object would get strong kick from the portal and its momentum would be transferred to the portal gates. This would definitely not be pleasant experience if you are entering quickly - probably like hitting a concrete wall. Note I do not know if this is the solution you wanted, but it seems quite self-consistent to me. I definitely do not guarantee that it is consistent with the general relativity - it is probably not. (On one side because the portal gates are curvature o space and require extreme exotic mass, which brings additional effects. On the other side because the proposed model is not the only one - I know at least about one more consistent possibility, that is probably the case for wormholes. If you want to go this deep, you should be asking about wormholes, not portals. 

Something a little different: Microwaves! Your average North American weighs about 80 kg, which is mostly water. The specific heat of vaporization for water is about 2.2 kj/gram, or about 176 MJ to vaporize a person if they're 100% water. According to this lovely chart, we get the best performance for liquid water versus gaseous water in the infrared window between 8-14 microns(near-IR radiation). They're not very large or powerful but I'm sure you could scale them up easily. The radiation is efficiently absorbed by liquid water but inefficiently absorbed by their boiling flesh, so it should pass through the expanding gas quickly and get right back to heating the rest of their body. Bones and connective tissue might be a problem, but you did specify 'most of the enemy'. The chief problem is cooling, but since you mentioned you could put a tank of LN2 nearby and not have to carry it, this technically counts as handheld. You might also want to plug this into mains power, you will pull down 3MW or more for the whole minute, or about 4 thousand horsepower. A small nuclear reactor could power enough lasers to melt five people a minute, but a single really big diesel generator will work great for just one person at a time.
