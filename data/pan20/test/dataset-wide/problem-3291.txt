The reason African tone is complicated is because it is difficult for speakers of European languages to visualize tone as a phonological feature on a par with, let's say, manner of articulation of consonants. Vowel height harmony, which you already mention, should be a gentler example, because everyone can intuitively appreciate how a high vowel causes an otherwise non-high vowel to become high. Wikipedia's page on Vowel Harmony has a number of examples that you can use. 

A theta role is a very simple concept: is the name that we give to the relation between an event and an individual participating in that event. How coarse- or fine-grained we want our theta roles to be is a totally different question. I suggest you pick up Heidi Harley's survey article on theta roles (referenced in the Wikipedia entry) and work your way from there. 

From a purely cognitive point of view, it doesn't really matter how many languages you introduce, or in which order so long as: 

Unaccusativity is a syntactic notion: a predicate has a single argument position. Inchoativity is a semantic notion: a predicate denotes the beginning of an event. Some verbs are inchoative and unaccusative (e.g., the sauce thickened), but this is a coincidence, not a significant fact. 

In English many rules have been advocated by language purists. They don't like a certain construction, so they invent a rule prohibiting it. Examples: Thou shalt not use "they" in the singular. Thou shalt not end a sentence in a preposition. This is despite the fact that there are numerous examples of well respected authors doing this for hundreds of years, e.g. Shakespeare. My parents used to avoid the use of "for free", stating that "'free' means 'for nothing', so 'for free' means 'for for nothing'", which they considered made it ungrammatical. I don't know if they still do this. I still prefer to use "free" instead of "for free" although there may be times when I use "for free". 

I couldn't find any further etymology for scratch. It seems to me that Ancient Greek χάρτης (khártēs) is similar to Modern English scratch (e.g. a mid-point could be krats). Could these words have the same source as each other considering that the root word is hypothesised to mean scratch? 

card English From Middle English carde (“playing card”), from Old French carte, from Latin charta, from Ancient Greek χάρτης (khártēs, “paper, papyrus”). chart English From Middle French charte (“card, map”), from Late Latin charta (“paper, card, map”), Latin ("papyrus, writing"), from Ancient Greek χάρτης (khártēs, “papyrus, thin sheet”). χάρτης Ancient Greek noun 

Freeze's excellent 1992 article "Existentials and other locatives" (Language 68, 553-595) points out that "the English existential is unique even among the truly exceptional existentials of its sister languages" (p. 575). 

[*] or at least in the relevant subfield. For example, you tend to see textbooks with titles like "Introduction to [name of theoretical framework]". What you find in those are things that are well-established within the framework in question, even though there might be competing frameworks that propose pretty different ways of doing things. 

You are asking for impossible things. A textbook, by definition, covers material that is fairly well-established in the field,[*] and note that the degree of difficulty of the material is not a good indicator of how well-established the conclusions are. If you want to know about cutting-edge research, you need to be reading journals and attending conferences. That said, this is what I tend to recommend to my syntax-semantics students (in no particular order). Syntax 

This restriction is not universal. Prenominal modifiers in Dutch and German can have complements of their own, although the pattern looks a bit different because these complements precede the head of the modifier (e.g., German "seine [seit 1982 erwartete] Rückkehr", literally "his since 1982 expected return"). Even English allows complements to prenominal modifiers on occasion. I can't remember exactly where, but once I heard the phrase "a Shakesperian in magnitude power struggle". Even if this restriction were universal, I don't see how it would follow from Antisymmetry. You would have to enact a ban on complex specifiers, which is something that would be clearly wrong in the general case. You could get closer to reality by enacting a ban on complex specifiers to specific heads (e.g., N), but at this point, there isn't any practical difference between adopting Antisymmetry or not. 

Are there any studies on language acquisition for illiterate French people? Are they aware of the spelling of French words on a subconscious level to be able to pronounce them correctly in different sentences or do they split the words into two or more pronunciations based on sound alone? e.g. « c'est » is /sɛ/ before a consonant or an aspirated H, and /sɛt/ before a vowel or a mute H. Maybe another way of thinking about it is: do illiterate French people consider /sɛ/ and /sɛt/ to be the same word or two different words with the same meaning (ignoring all other possible homophones)? I don't know if there are currently many French people who are illiterate so this question might be hard to answer. 

The words don't have to be in the English family, I'm interested if this has happened in any language. 

Are there any words that started off different, merged in pronunciation and spelling at some point and then separated again? 

From χαράσσω (kharássō, “I scratch, inscribe”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰer- (“to scratch”). scratch English Probably from a blend of the Middle English words scratten (“to scratch”) and crachen (“to scratch”). 

Spoken Sinhala has "eya" which is used in place of the English "he"/"she". It also has gender specific words but in the spoken language I've never heard them used. Some native Sinhala speakers have difficulty separating "he"/"she" in English and use "he" for females with or without auto-correcting to "her". I believe that in written Sinhala there is gender distinction for third person pronouns. 

Within the system you are describing, the only way to ensure that AgrSP and TP are invariably adjacent is by defining Agr as the kind of head that takes TP as its complement. This is plausible, but to answer your question, I can't see what exactly would go wrong if Agr selected some MysteryP that in turn selected TP. As per the theory of movement your question presupposes, subject raising from SpecTP to SpecAgrSP ought to be possible so long as no other DP needing NOM intervenes. [side note 1: this tree is kind of old-fashioned. These days, you'll have trouble finding people seriously accepting that English has an AgrSP separate from TP ---see, e.g., Bobaljik and Thráinsson 1998, "Two heads aren't always better than one", Syntax 1:37-73] [side note 2: independently of the narrow issue of your question, adverbs are known to have placement restrictions that don't follow from the kind of X-bar theory you are assuming! Check out Bobaljik 1999, "Adverbs: the hierarchy paradox", GLOT International 4:27-28.] 

Example: mom's native language is Arabic, dad's native language is Japanese, family is living in Hungary. Each parent is fluent is the other's native language as well as Hungarian. The ideal environment in this household is one in which, when the child is present, the mother speaks exclusively Arabic, the father speaks exclusively Japanese, and they speak exclusively Hungarian when interacting with locals. Here, chances are the child will end up acquiring all three languages simultaneously. Obviously, this is an idealized situation. More common are situations where the parents are not totally fluent in each other's native languages and/or the local language. In these cases, you'll need to adjust a bit, but you'll be fine so long as you keep points 1. and 2. in mind.
