By 'faint' you mean the person lost consciousness or was it just weakness? I was in a similar position but not that severe. I was in the wrong assumption that I was acclimatizing fine because I was the strongest in the group during that time. I felt great, no headache or nausea or anything at all on the acclimatization mountains up to 4500m. On the summit attempt I started getting weaker and weaker above 5000m. At 5500m I finally had to return because I was extremely weak plus nausea (no vomitting). My team members had no problems btw. For the details of my story please read this topic. I think one reason in my example was that my body would have been better acclimatized if I hadn't gone so fast while hiking the preparatory mountains. This doesn't mean you are safe but it helps during acclimatization process if you go very slowly without getting anerob regularly. I can't find a medical paper for now, but at least here are two sources saying the same: 

What species is the following? I assume it is a cockroach, but I am not sure. What is it exactly? I live in South Germany. 

The weather is very harsh, and the mountain does not allow much area to take a walk on a day when you are not going up the mountain. This sounds like two points mixed up. Is it the bad weather what keeps you on the camp or is it the lack of routes or ideas? For the last part I would suggest to at least go up and/or down on the route you are planning to do. You could explore the route, search for other (better) routes, enjoy the nature you are pleased to attend or even do some team trainings like possible crevasse scenarios or mountain rescue in general. If you stay in the camp for several days without really doing something, this could yield to bad physical shape. Doing a several-hour walk every two days will fasten your acclimatization and increase fitness. The day between will be great for regeneration including eating, sleeping, gear preparation and so on. Another point I could imagine while being a week or more stuck in a camp are social issues. Even if you stay there with people you know for years and who are good friends of you, this might be difficult. Especially if you are under harsh conditions and there is only that limited room in the tent. If the weather is so badly that you have a very limited visibility and/or the cold/wind won't let you out for a longer walk, you might be really lucky to be even able to sleep properly. Most will be frightened. Indeed this is a situation where you should be concerned not getting snowbound or cut off supplies. 

Yes, the R-value will add of your different layers. If you wear layer A with R=5 and layer B with R=2.5, the overall insulation value will be R=7.5. 

In my opinion the major risk wearing no snowshoes on deep snow (besides the time aspect) is that you step close in front of a stone or other obstacle. You don't have to run, it is just normal that your leg benches and it is likely that your shin gets levered against that obstacle. That leverage increases the force on your shin and maybe the ankle which might cause harm. If you are wearing snowshoes you are increasing your footprint where those injuries aren't that likely to happen anymore. So far I was lucky not to get injured by that scenario but I think it is quite a likely risk. And of course this is not valid on every terrain. 

I know it's probably too risky to make alpine tours alone, especially when you go over glaciers. I joined DAV to be insured while in the mountains and to be able to use the offerings like courses and guided tours. But they are quite expensive, I can't and don't want to do this every month. I also read books about the topic but I guess book knowledge isn't enough, especially for higher risk mountain tours. In my opinion the best would be to have a couple of more advanced friends who are able to teach or even know guides or groups and go with them for fun and to learn. Unfortunately I am not having this opportunity. 

You will always find climbers saying they want 100% safety for their hobby. That's a bit like the mountaineers trying to go on ski tour or doing alpine tours only if there is literally no avalanche risk, no risk of stone fall, no chance to get bad weather and so on. It is impossible to get these bulletproof safety margins. You aren't 100% safe if you go in the mountains. If you don't accept that rest risk, you shouldn't go climbing or mountaineering at all. Therefore the reason for that myth has to do with the attitude of climbers. Even not going climbing you are exposed to risks all the time. You know the mantra that most accidents happen in your household. Also in terms of micro-fractures people shouldn't fly with planes then, because every plane has millions of micro-fractures in the wings. Still the risk of fail is extremely low. The whole aircraft industry is aware that one fatal error yields to immense harm, therefore the safety factor is very high. Same for climbing gear where one error will most likely be fatal. For your everyday vacuum cleaner it's not that bad when it moulders some day... Also if you throw away each biner when it shows some minor scratches, outdoor industry won't be unhappy to sell you more new stuff. Naturally they are sometimes exaggerating plus they are responsible to exclude damage of their customers because of marketing issues. So most times the outdoor industry will be very conservative with their recommendations. 

In southern Germany there are a lot of steep hills which don't have too much rock but mainly grass. Therefore people are "grass climbing" mountains, there is even a grass climbing grade for it. 

I just was told this last weekend: Lock your tent! Of course thiefes can cut the tent and still steal your stuff but at least your insurance is going to pay if the tent was locked (check the conditions of your insurance and in doubt ask your insurer). Besides that you should not leave your valuable stuff in the tent alone, also if it's just valuable for you like the knife your grandfather gave you years ago.
