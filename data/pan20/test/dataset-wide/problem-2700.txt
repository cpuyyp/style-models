I fear not; if two things are not in the same category, there is no sense in which they can be opposite. Maybe there are instances you may discover or invent a category encompassing two different things or concepts, in a way that they are opposite (for instance, mammals could be the "opposite" of birds if we established a fur/feather category that opposed them - but this sounds rather artificial to me). 

So, yes, we can enter the same river - in the relation in which the river is the same, regardless of what individual atoms compose it - and never enter the same river - in the relation in which the individual atoms of the "same" river never flow through in the same order and position, if ever. If so, the opposites 

So, beyond a certain level, even if there was absolutely no effect in the incentive to work (which is in itself a dubious assumption), the result of a UBI will be a crisis in the system, probably giving way to a backlash in exploitation. 

If A (they do not blindfold me) then B (they intend to kill me). A (they did not blindfold me). [from 1. and 2.] B (they intend to kill me). 

The last sentence could easily be interpreted as "sarcastic": "yes, that is what good people do, they bring crime and drugs, and are rapists; see how absurd that idea that Mexican immigrants are nice people is?" It is not like it sounds (it sounds more like a caveat, an attempt to say he has not said what he just said), but it isn't impossible. Even if it is actually sarcastic, though, I fail to see how it makes it any better. 

Note that all propositions, both premises (1. and 2.) and conclusion (3.) are true. But the argument is invalid, because the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Here is another valid argument: 

It cannot be so indifferent to such "non-reproducible" things, as they will contaminate the reasoning and result in non-verifiable hypotheses. And so, they must be purged. 

You cannot defeat him because you are insisting in something that is not correct. Gravity is not a "fact". Gravity is a theory. It happens to be a theory that satisfactorily explains most observable facts (or, more precisely, most of the observable facts that it seeks to explain). You don't need it to be a fact; actually, you would be ontologically degrading it by considering it a fact. More generally, science does not "prove" things, or at least this is not its central endeavour. Science strives to provide explanations for observable phenomena ("facts"), if possible in a way that becomes predictive. You don't "prove" that matter attracts matter in direct proportion to mass and in inverse proportion to the square of distance. You use that hypothesis to predict the behaviour of physical bodies; as long as its predictions are correct, the theory remains unchallenged. It is not "proved"; however, and the intention of science is not to prove it. If its predictions fail, ie, if it cannot predict the "facts" correctly, then it has to be ammended, or, if its failures are big enough, it is refuted. Science strives to refute its own theories, not to prove them: it systematically seeks the "deviant" facts that would refute them, and only maintain its theories as long as it isn't able to find those facts. Naturally, what your opponent seems to be doing is to use these correct points to defend a position that is basically solipsism. That his argumentation is in bad faith can be demonstrated by the fact that he doesn't live by it. He knows that our knowledge, provisional as it is, is working knowledge. He knows he shouldn't drink the hemlock, jump from a window at the seventh floor, cross the street without looking both sides, or bet on Red Socks, and he abides by this knowledge. So he, himself, refutes his own points: while they may be "correct" in a completely abstract way, concretely he knows better and behaves as if he didn't believe in them. 

To "mourn", on the other hand, is psychological, not moral or juridical, phenomenon. So, the "moral right to mourn" is a conflation of disparate concepts, which becomes meaningless at all three - juridical, moral, psychological - levels. Juridically, there is nothing that can be done to prevent people from mourning. If they think that the defeat of their preferred soccer team is something to mourn, more than the death of thousands of people in a war on the other side of the planet, there is nothing to be done about. What would we do? Jail them? Tell them they are going to hell? Dose them some chemical that will make them unable to mourn? Morally, you can condemn whatever you want. It doesn't affect the rights of others. You may think that those who see too much television lose their moral grounds to complain about the moral decadence of society, for television is hugely responsible for such decadence. They will still watch TV and complain about the decaying mores of the commonwealth. Both things are, and should be, legal rights; a society in which either or both were forbidden would be horrible to live in. Psychologically, there is nothing that can be done about mourning or not mourning. One may think that I should mourn the extinction of the pox virus; but the fact is that if I am not, for any reason, psychologically attached to such virus, I won't mourn its extinction, and may be indifferent or happy about it. It's possible, I guess, to shame people into pretending that they are unhappy about a given event, but it is not possible to make them unhappy if they are not. And this - shaming people - is what this idea is probably about. It is not that we should not mourn the passing of our grandmother just because we just ate a barbecue; it is that we should not have eaten the barbecue, for we should think of the poor cow as we think of our grandmother. But as some of the comments above pointed out, the vast majority of human beings do not think a cow is equivalent to a human being, and consequently won't be able to act as if it was. 

You can say anything about "nothing", and it won't be false. But possibly the problem is that an "empty universe" is counter-intuitive in itself, so anything that is said about it is counter-intuitive? 

are both true, but they are not identical: they are true concerning different relations. "River" means different things in each sentence, different meanings that are fused in most ordinary uses of the word. 

No one? Who owns the Moon, the Sun, the bottom of the ocean, the intellectual property rights to the wheel or pottery? 

No. More likely, the result is just some diminishment of exploitation, that doesn't really change the system. If the UBI is pushed too high, it would put the system into crisis. 

And then proceeds to clarifying the relation between religious emancipation and what he calls human emancipation: 

(Marx's emphasys) So Bauer demands that Jews cease to consider themselves as Jews, as a precondition of their emancipation: you are free to be Jews, as long as... you are not Jews. Then the stigma of Judaism, imposed upon you, is unjust and discriminatory; but as long as you remain Jewish, you cannot argue against discrimination, for you discriminate yourselves: 

I don't think that these arguments belong to the theist/atheist debate. An atheist can perfectly think that a belief without evidence is rational. And both atheists and theists can perfectly agree that a "rational belief" is not necessarily a "true" belief. Before understanding nuclear reactions, people could well believe that the sun was a ball of fire. It would be a rational belief; the only thing humans knew, from experience, that could cause the kind and amount of heath the sun gives out was fire. We now know that this belief, never mind how rational it may have been, was false. We may also believe that the Goldbach conjecture is true. This is a belief without evidence; it is also a perfectly rational belief. So that is a different debate; one can believe in God knowing that there is no evidence for its existence, one can believe that there is evidence for the existence in God, one can believe that God does not exist out of other considerations than the "rationality" of arguments against its existence. 

It should be obvious that 3. doesn't follow (or rather, that its negation follows) from 1. (which is, as far as I can see, a true statement) and 2. (which is more debatable, but is probably held as true by many people, and especially by many people who are attracted to Mr. Trump's kind of destructive rhetoric). That the reasoning implied is evidently invalid (not that its conclusion is false) is what makes such kind of retort "sarcastic". So, are Mr. Trump's trumpisms sarcastic? Maybe, take this for instance: 

determine what the decision is about (let's say, should we build a wall along the Mexican border, yes or not?) the relevant stakeholders discuss the issue freely, pointing out the pros and cons of the proposal (how much does the wall cost? will it solve the problem it is designed to solve? what collateral effects might it have?). This is where the concept of "freedom" intertwines with "democracy"; if some points are not allowed into discussion, you cannot have a "democratic decision", for not all aspects of the issue will be considered. once the relevant stakeholders can agree that the issue has been cleared, they take a vote on it, and the "side" that has more votes gets its proposed policy implemented. That is, if more people vote for building a wall along the Mexican border, then we build the wall; otherwise, we do not build the wall. 

"Murder" is the intentional, illegal killing of a person. Evidently, society would collapse if we were to go killing each others at a whim, so most killings are forbidden as a logical result from the fact that we live in society. But there are several exceptions - self-defence, war, the death penalty, for instance - in which the deliberate killing of a person is not illegal, and consequently is not murder. Of course, if something is illegal, then it is deemed "wrong" from the point of view of the law. The law considers it wrong. There is no absolute moral that makes it metaphysically "wrong". But whether wrong or not wrong, if you illegaly kill someone, you will probably face very dire consequences, and making philosophical points about it won't spare you jail, stigma or the lethal injection. So, in principle, don't do it if you do not have extraordinarily good reasons for it (I would say, in practical terms, not unless it is tyrannicide). 

This is evidently false, even from an atheist point of view. Indeed, it is a well known fallacy, so any atheist with some knowledge of logic will reject this. "Weak atheists", ie, agnostics, may think that the problem of God's existence is a problem of evidence or lack thereof. It is, in my opinion, a naive position, that would lead them to the most absurd consequences - orbital teapots included. But a "strong" atheist, ie, an atheist proper, will tell you that the concept of God is absurd, or self-contradictory, or morally destructive, and conclude for the inexistence of God regardless of any evidence, just as they will discard the idea of a four-angled pentagon, of someone being the father of his own father, or the idea that eating human flesh is a good one. 

Cats (or any other non-human animals) cannot be actual bearers of "rights" in the sence we understand "rights" as applied to humans, because rights are necessarily social rights, and non-human animals do not participate in human society, and the non-human societies they eventually participate in are not predicated on the notion of "rights". In fact, no one that I am informed thinks that a non-human animal has the right to vote, the right to free expression or free assembly, any right of property. Indeed, the only "rights" that I see assigned to them are those of living and of not being subjected to pain. Evidently, whatever we do afford to cats (or any other pet) is based on either projections of our own desires, or on our own necessities (does a cat have the right to roam away from its owner home? Does it have a right to not be neutered?). In such, I fear the concept of "rights" is degraded, into something very different and much more limited than what we were used to think as "rights". 

If a person owns his or her body, then it follows that he or she can sell it. But this necessitates the institution of slavery; once I have sold myself into slavery, my owner has the right to have his property protected by the State, so that if I change my mind and flee away, the State has an obligation to return me to my owner. Fortunately, most, if not all, States have abolished such nefarious institution, and forbidden people from selling themselves. So it seems that most, or all, States do not believe that a person owns her body. 

I don't think "organic reach" is an example of Wittgenstein would call either a "misuse of language" or an instance where "language suggests a body and there is none". Rather, it seems to me that he would argue that "organic reach" is an ordinary use of language; this would lead us into error if we start attributing "organic" qualities (being green, having DNA, growing and reproducing like living beings, being good for health, etc, etc, etc) to it, but not if we realise that there is nothing "organic" in "organic reach" more than there is anything starry or fishy in a star fish. But this kind of (mis)interpretation seems common in the internet. I have seen things like "Wittgenstein would be against gay marriage because marriage by definition is between a man and a woman, so that would be a misuse of language" and even "the actual meaning of 'you must be kidding' is 'you have a moral obligation to talk in jest', otherwise that is a misuse of language, and therefore nonsense, or non-sence, or metaphysic, or simply absurd". But yes, other people followed his lead on this subject. Anscombe, Quine, Austin, come to mind, but there is, or used to be, a whole field of "phylosophy of language", ultimately leading into "analytic philosophy". Whether any of those people had an adequate grasp of Wittgenstein (whether it is possible for anyone to have such an adequate grasp) is debatable. 

What does "objective" mean? But, before we deal with that, it is necessary to remark that this sentence, 

It is valid because, if its premises (1. and 2.) were true, then 3. logically follows. It's conclusion (3.) is false because one of its premises (1.) is false (or so we fervently hope). Here is an invalid argument: 

you mistake the non-existence of unicorns in "reality" to contradict the existence of unicorns as one-horned horses in concept. But those are two very different orders of "existence". In concept, unicorns do have one horn, not two and not zero. Their inexistence in "reality" can't change that. "Things" can exist in concept without existing in reality; things can exist in reality without existing in concept. If we confuse these two levels, we may think we have prooved that unicorns exist, because un-existent unicorns don't have horns at all. But, as others have pointed out, inexistent entities can have any number of horns we fancy; I could point to an ox, and say, "look, there is a two-horned unicorn". By that "logic", unicorns indeed exist in "reality"; it only takes the effort of naming something else a "unicorn". (Marco Polo (in)famously saw unicorns; he however remarked that they were not white, didn't look too much like a horse, and should not be trusted with virgins. Evidently, we would say he saw a rhinoceros. It is only by historic accident that rhinoceros are not called "unicorns" - they may even be the origin of the whole legend. If things had happened differently, we would call rhinoceros "unicorns", and no one would doubt they exist, although being at the risk of extinction. And we would make jokes about the fact that some unicorns have three horns instead of one.) But "reality" is not created by acts of speech. Naming something else a "unicorn" would change the definition of the word, not the state of affairs in what we call "world". Shortly put, as long as a unicorn is a white horse with one ivory horn, unicorns do not exist, because we won't be able to find "real" white horses with one ivory horn. As soon as we use the word for something else, then unicorns exist, but they are no longer defined as "white horses with one ivory horn". What your argument does is to prove that unicorns exist as a concept. But that was never in any serious doubt; unicorns exist in human imagination, literary descriptions, paintings, engravings, sculptures, drawings, and, more recently, in photo-shop. We can and do imagine things that don't exist, like unicorns or the headless mule that puffs fire from its nostrils. We can even put some of those imagined things - like circles and straight lines - to use in important and meaningful ways. "Reality" however doesn't feel obligated to bow to our whims.
