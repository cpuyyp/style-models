This also yields the semilocal case, since then $\overline{R}$ is a finite product of fields. Concerning the limitations of the first proposition: although the condition that $I$ avoids only finitely many maximal ideals seems strong, it is in a sense sharp: e.g. $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for $p$ prime, $p > 3$ does not induce a surjection on units. One final remark that may be of interest: 

If $B/I$ is regular local, then $I$ is a prime ideal in $B$. Notice that $x^m \not \in I$ (if $x \in I$, then the equations defining $I$ would imply $y_1, \ldots, y_n \in I$, so then $I$ would be the maximal ideal, which it is not, being $n$-generated). Thus $x^m$ is regular on $B/I$ (and on $B$), so taking a finite free $B$-resolution of $B/I$, and tensoring with $B/(x^m)$, produces a finite free $B/(x^m) = A[[y_1, \ldots, y_n]]$-resolution of your module $M = B/I \otimes_B B/(x^m)$. By the way, the condition that $B/I$ is regular seems to be just that each $g_i$ contains $y_i$ as a linear term (up to a unit of $k$). This is certainly sufficient, and in order for the generators of $I$, along with one more element, to form a regular sop of $B$, it is also necessary. 

I was wondering what the connection is between the notion of "prime congruence" on a monoid, and the notion of "prime ideal" in a monoid. Starting from a prime ideal $P$ in a monoid $M$, one can naturally define a congruence $\sim_P$ from $P$ (the Reese congruence), but that doesn't seem to be a prime congruence. Is there another connection ? Thanks ! 

Suppose $A$ is a $k$-algebra, with $k$ a field, and let $\ell$ be a field extension of $k$. Is there an easy way to see/recover $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ in/from $\mathrm{Spec}(A \otimes_k \ell)$, using the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$ ? Important special case: $\ell$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. To illustrate my question, let $\ell$ be an algebraic closure of $k$. Then a maximal ideal $\frak{m}$ of $A$ corresponds to an $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-orbit of maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ (the maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ ''over $\frak{m}$''). Is such a thing true for the other prime ideals (and for any field extension $\ell$, not ''just'' algebraic closures) ? Is there a similar way (so using the $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-action as above) to describe the closed sets of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ ? 

There is a simple and reasonably general sufficient criterion for a ring surjection $f : R \to S$ to induce a surjection $f^\times : R^\times \to S^\times$ on unit groups (apologies for bumping an old post, but none of the other answers seemed to have this simple line of reasoning). 

To prevent things from being too easy, I require two conditions on $R$: 1) $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ should be connected (otherwise take $R = k_1 \times \ldots \times k_n$) 2) $R$ should be Noetherian (otherwise take $R$ to be a polynomial ring over $\mathbb{Z}$ in sufficiently many variables) I would be happy with the case $n = 2$ (although I don't currently see how to get the general case from this). However, I do insist that the fields be arbitrary - it is known that any finite collection of countable fields is the set of residue fields of a PID (see this article by Heitmann - first page only). (I've included the algebraic-geometry tag in hopes for some geometric insight. If however someone feels that this is sufficiently non-geometric, feel free to edit the tags.) 

Consider the Grothendieck ring $K_0(\mathcal{V}_k)$ of $k$-varieties. Then for any $k$-variety $X$, and closed subset $C$ of $X$, we have the relation $$[X] = [X \setminus C] + [C],$$ where $[X]$ means the isomorphism class of $X$. Now suppose, for example, that $\mathbf{P}$ is a projective $k$-space of some dimension $n \geq 2$, and let $C$ and $C'$ be finite sets of closed points in $\mathbf{P}$ of the same order. Then we have $$[\mathbf{P} \setminus C] + [C] = [\mathbf{P} \setminus C'] + [C'].$$ Are $C$ and $C'$ considered to be isomorphic $k$-varieties ? If so, we obtain $$[\mathbf{P} \setminus C] = [\mathbf{P} \setminus C'],$$ which seems pretty strange, taken that, for instance, $C$ could be a set of rational points on some line, and $C'$ a set of rational points in general position. Or should the isomorphism class of (for instance) a finite point set be understood differently ? And if the answer of the first question above is "yes," is there a way to distinguish between such sets in the context of Grothendieck rings ? What would be a/the cohomological interpretation of $$[\mathbf{P} \setminus C] = [\mathbf{P} \setminus C']?$$ 

Proof: Write $I := \ker f$, and $\text{mSpec}(R) \setminus V(I) = \{m_1,...,m_n\}$. Then $\{I, m_1,...,m_n\}$ are pairwise comaximal. Pick $v \in S^\times$, and write $v = f(u)$ for some $u \in R$ (notice $u \not \in m$, for any $m \in \text{mSpec}(R) \cap V(I)$). By Chinese Remainder, there exists $a \in R$ with $a \equiv 0 \pmod{I}$, $a \equiv 1-u \pmod{m_i}$ for $i = 1,...,n$. Then $u + a \in R^\times$, and $f(u+a) = f(u) = v$. This immediately yields that if $R$ is semilocal (has only finitely many maximal ideals), then every surjection out of $R$ induces a surjection on units. This generalizes the case where $R$ is Artinian (or finite). The case that $I$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $R$ can also be recovered via the reduction: 

Let $A \mapsto S$ and $B \mapsto S$ be two schemes over the scheme $S$. Is there a connection between the automorphism group of the scheme $A \otimes_{S} B$ and the automorphism groups of $A$ and $B$ ? What about special cases such as: 

the case where $A$ and $B$ are affine schemes over $\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field, or specific examples which behave good/bad ? 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a toric variety, with $T$ a torus embedded as an open set in $\mathcal{X}$ (and where the algebraic action of $T$ extends to $\mathcal{X}$). As I am not a toric specialist at all, I was wondering if there is a simple description of the "boundary," that is, the closed subvariety $C_T := \mathcal{X} \setminus T$. Example: if $\mathcal{X} = \mathrm{Spec}(k[x,y])$ and $T \cong (k^\times)^2$, then $C_T$ consists of two intersecting (affine) lines.
