Bears don’t really hibernate, although they lower their activity during winter. Here’s one sample study of Black Bear winter behaviour in Sierra Nevada, California: 

I much prefer the regulated mode, to the point I don’t get why decent outdoor stuff manufacturers like Petzl still sell unregulated lamps at all. Second most important thing would be the power source. I’m happy with a compact lamp that includes the batteries in the same box as the light source. Depending on your requirements you might need a separate battery box. It offers more power and you can keep it under your jacket in cold weather to keep the batteries warm and happy. On the other hand it’s another thing to keep somewhere on your body and another possible point of failure (the cables between the battery pack and the light are known to be pretty flimsy). If you decide for a compact lamp where the batteries are in the same box as the light source, you still have the choice at least between AA, AAA and special batteries. I have a lamp that requires 3 AAA batteries and wouldn’t choose the same type again, because I can’t easily change batteries between my gear (the GPS and camera use regular AAs), the AAAs are little less common (so you might be out of luck when looking for cold-weather Lithium batteries, for example) and the odd number of batteries is a nuisance when charging. For similar reasons I don’t want a lamp powered by special batteries. I mostly don’t care for other things. Waterproof body is always a good idea. And there’s always the question of how much light power is enough. The simple answer is any modern LED lamp will probably do for you, unless you have some extra requirements like fast movement (biking, skiing or running in the night). If you do have these extra requirements, it’s good to see what other people in your target group use, and test in the real conditions. 

I've done this a few times with about 30 people in my hiking and camping group. My main preparation was in selecting a place that was as safe as possible. The lake we camped on is surrounded by a loop trail of about 11 miles. So the first day is 6 miles and the second day is 5. However, there is an easy to walk, but unmarked, one mile path to a road that leads to the trailhead. Every time I've done this, a few people need to take the shortcut out and I have a co-host to guide them. The guide then walks another mile to the cars and drives back to pick them up. We also use the shortcut to carry in a few extras, such as supplies to set up a latrine, a good size first aid kit and a cache of extra potable water. I want this to be a moderate experience of backpacking for my friends, not a chore for them. The campsite has access via a forest service road with a locked gate. I prepared instruction to give to emergency responders on how to drive to the site, if needed. And I let the US forest service office know we will be at the site. It is a good idea to have the direct dial number for the proper emergency services in case 911 (or similar) does not work at the location or directs you to another county's service. If you do not know that cell service is available at the campsite, determine where usable service may stop on the way in or scout out the surrounding area's service availability in advance. 

Fenix HL30 would be my choice right now. Two AA batteries, 200 lumens peak output (for a limited time), regulated light, sturdy construction, reputable company. 

There’s quite a lot of people interested in fasting for spiritual and health purposes. When fasting, these people don’t drink anything but water and don’t eat anything at all, their stomach simply pauses. And it’s not unusual to fast like this for several days or even weeks. One of my friends tried a three-week fast and I happened to meet him just as he was ending. He was quite skinny, but appeared fully functional. Another friend of mine fastened for at least two weeks, I can’t remember the exact number. Both of them lead a normal life, the first one even kept running his usual kilometers and the second one kept working as a scientist. I am not saying that you should try this or that it’s completely harmless. (Especially the return to normal food takes a long time and you must excercise a great care and discipline.) My point is that three weeks without food is nothing unheard of and you don’t have to be a walking corpse in the end. I’m not sure if eating small amounts of food is better than eating nothing. During the first several days of fasting the body shifts to a different energy source, it could be that starting the stomach again would do more harm then good. Anyway, if you happen to be without food for a week or so, there’s no need to panic. You’ll be uncomfortable, but you’ll be fine. You can even try fasting for several days to see how the body works in those conditions, but in that case please don’t trust a random stranger on the Internet and find somebody who knows what he’s doing :) 

Aluminum canoes became popular because the aerospace company Grumman had surplus manufacturing capacity after World War 2. As did aluminum producer Alcoa. (There were probably other companies to) Alcoa's manufacturing was based in the North West and powered by relatively cheap hydroelectric power at the time there was little other need for the power. At the time the main alternatives were wood or perhaps fiberglass. Those suffer from weight or fragility problems. All those factors have changed now. Aluminum is now more expensive. Power demand in the North West is no longer met by hydro and aluminum is a globally produced commodity that can be imported from places where power is cheaper. Combine this with the problems with aluminum mentioned in other answers and the remarkable improvements in plastics since the 1950's and you have a much better materials for consumer grade, durable craft. 

There’s a special “winter” gas mix available for gas stoves. How is it different from the usual propane/butane mix and why does it work better in low temperatures? (Does it work better in lower temperatures? :-) 

Yes, I think I’m a stronger person because of it, as I’m a bit more accustomed to my own fear. As for dealing with awkward feelings when being out alone, it’s hard to give a good advice. In such situations I usually simply push myself a little bit; mostly the rational push proves to be beneficial in hindsight. I consider it to be an interesting skill to know when and how far you can override your instincts. 

The fastest hikes I've done are with a small group headed by a guy that has a very fast pace. My natural pace is about 3.25 MPH. I just fall into that unless I concentrate all the time, which is hard to do once you start to get a bit tired on the trail by going faster than the natural pace. I often lead hikes of 60 or so people and can keep ahead of most of the group on flat lands. But I'm relatively slow on climbs (struggling to make 1000 feet an hour, breath has always been a problem for me) and many of those who lag behind in the flats will pass me going up hill. So the real answer is, it depends on your body, the terrain and who you hike with. 

Here in Czech Republic we don’t have many bears, most of them cross from Slovakia, but around the state border it’s quite common to find bear footprints in snow during the winter. Draw your own conclusions. 

I don’t think that will work for heavy rain. The waterproofing coating will make the water slide away from the garment (this is the so-called lotus effect), but that’s just one part of keeping the water out. The harder part is not letting the water through under pressure, like when you press the garment against something, under your backpack straps, under heavy rainfall etc. Here the simple waterproofing finish will eventually give way and the water will get through.
