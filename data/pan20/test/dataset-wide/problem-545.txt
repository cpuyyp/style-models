There are a couple of things you can try before throwing down serious money on a professional fit or a new bike (side note, if you buy a new bike from a shop be sure to negotiate a free fitting session if it doesn't come with one automatically). First, the most obvious thing to do is to get some proper bicycle specific gloves with beefy gel pads on the palms. If full finger gloves are two warm for you go with the fingerless type. Seriously though don't skimp on the gloves. The second option which is a little more experimental in nature is to lower your seat a little bit. This will take a little bit of pressure off of your hands, maybe even enough to solve your problem completely. But you have to be careful with this because lowering your seat can put strain on your knees, and your knees are the last thing you want to injure from improper fit. If your knees bother you at all, abort mission and raise your seat. $URL$ If you're still having issues after that, it might be time to look at a proper fitting bike. 

Traveling long distances on a bike seat is almost always going to be uncomfortable when your body isn't used to it. Give it time. But also, consider taking your bike with you to have a professional make sure the seat and the bike fit you. Some people have managed to permanently damage their blood vessels ( I won't go into detail ) by improperly sitting on a bike seat. Call around to see if there's a bike shop near you that can help and ask how much they'll charge you. 

You have a brand new wheelset which is within 0.05mm of true yet has wide variation in spoke tension. Because the wheel is true it probably means that when the wheel was built attention was not paid to balancing the spoke tensions. That is a sign of low quality wheel building. Tension among all spokes should be +/- 5%. Or course on the rear wheel the DS and NDS may use different tensions, as much as 40% difference. You should at least take it back to your point of purchase and see what they have to say. Finally this year I tired of constantly truing my 16/24 bladed spoke lightweight wheels, and purchased 32/32 round spoke medium weight wheels with Velocity A23 rims from a local wheel builder who offered a lifetime guarantee of wheel tuning. Nice - the spokes all came with balanced tension, and the wheels are solid meaning I never have to true them - except when I ran into a crevice, scraping the rims and flatting a tire. Still, barely out of alignment, but the wheel builder tuned it up anyway - nice guy. Much better than dealing with a faceless company. And oh yeah - these reliable wheels were one half what I paid for the unreliable ones. 

The seals will age over time, and air will leak in. Surprised (but not so much) that your LBS didn't suggest you have the seals replaced the second time you showed up. Undoubtedly available on Amazon. 

Very simply, short cages look quite short and long cages look quite long, especially so when compared side by side ( indeed, your photo is of a long cage ). Short cages typically have just a centimeter or so of space between the two pulleys, and well, you can see that a long cage has considerably more to accommodate the extra chain length needed for larger rings in either the front or back ( or both the front and back! ). If you were in a position to actually choose between buying one or the other, your LBS would surely go a long way to help, or you would have to do a considerable amount of reading: $URL$ 

It is extremely difficult to put even slightly worn ball bearing back into a hub. Over time they start to wear slightly unevenly, sometimes too slightly to be seen by the naked eye but slightly enough to make it difficult to line up again. You might need to take your wheel to an expert this time. 

I'd be willing to bet that whatever characteristics Trek gave that frame, those are exactly the characteristics that Trek wanted the bike to have. That man appears to be flexing the frame as hard as he can to get it to bounce. A video of a guy on a trainer isn't going to reveal much of anything useful in the real world. If you want to know how the bike does, you really do have to take it for your own test drive. I'd take the bouncing motion in the video with a grain of salt. The Domane is said to be very well designed and road worthy. 

Maybe it is just evolution's way of asking you to increase the chances of passing your genes onto future generations? Of course, it must be balanced against the greater number of potential mating partners who will be attracted to you as they watch you taking corners faster and lower, and seeing you in the top spot on the podium. 

If the bikes have a problem that causes them not to go, that can be lived with. But if they have a problem which causes them not to STOP, somebody could DIE. Those bikes have the cheapest brake pads possible which might wear out very quickly, depending how they are used. Most of your customers will not make any impact on the brake pads, but some will push the bikes hard, deliberately ride up and down hills, maybe in the rain - under such circumstances set of brake pads which you can still see the lines when renting out can become worn out completely in a single rental period, also causing damage to the wheel rims, not to mention legal problems in case of an accident. When you start replacing the worn brake pads, you might consider upgrading to other than the cheapest option, because they give a better usage-time/cost ratio. 

Would v-brakes with the normal v-brake long pads (as opposed to shorter brake pads) on road rims exhibit any problematic behavior going downhill at speeds of 50 mph? I am concerned that the longer brake pad may be more susceptible to shudder and/or grabbiness than shorter pads. Background: The bike in question is a Surly Cross Check which is set up with brake posts for cantilever or v-brake. Caliper is not an option. The brakes I have ready to put on are Deore XT br-t780 (with long brake pads) , front and back. Other v-brakes with shorter pads are available, e.g., Shimano BR-M422. (But these M422 are much lower quality than the T780 - and the question is about long vs short pads, not quality of the brakes they come with). The cable travel in the lever is not an issue as I have the problem solver travel device ready. 

If I were in your shoes at this intersection, my plan off attack would vary greatly depending on the time of day, the weather conditions, and the specific traffic conditions. If it were particularly dark and/or rainy, I might cross as a pedestrian even when I'm familiar with the intersection and I have good lighting, just to reduce the risk of losing some skin. During the day, depending on the speed limit, I would probably use a convenient gap in traffic to take the middle of that lane I need to turn left. Or, I'll often time it so that I can blend in with a line of stopped/slow moving cars and smoothly take the middle of the lane, most of the time the other drivers will get the idea ( you're going to occasionally run into a few jerks no matter what you do, don't take it personally ). Just take your time and feel it out, you'll get the hang of it. 

Cyclocross courses are (generally) too smooth and relatively fast to warrant the use of suspension. Sure, it might be more comfortable, but the added weight would only slow you down and leave you behind your competitors on a typical muddy course. 

Which pants do you have right now? And did you enjoy that downpour yesterday? There wasn't a dry cyclist in the city, breathable pants or not. Some days we're just going to get wet. Showers pass is made right here in portland, and I use them on all the nasty days, for me they work great $URL$ Arc'teryx, even though I can't pronounce their name, make the top of the line holy grail rain gear. I was just looking at these for myself yesterday: $URL$ 

Shimano 9 speed road and mountain parts are all compatible. Therefore you can add a 9-speed mountain long cage derailleur to use an 11-30 cogset on the rear along with your triple front. I do so on my tandem, and know many others who do the same. It falls within Shimano's guidelines for compatability. Not necessary or desirable to turn the B-screw all the way out. Shimano 9 speed mountain derailleur is compatible the shimano 10 speed shifters - but not officially. Reference: $URL$ I use this setup on a touring-cross bike: triple crankset 50-30, 11-32 10 speed cogset, 9-speed MTB derailleur. It works well but margin of error is smaller than "normal", resulting in more frequent tuning and replacement of parts as they wear out (chain wear, derailleur play). No problem with slack. Not necessary or desirable to turn the B-screw all the way out. It should be noted that long MTB derailleurs will be slightly heavier, and also the pulley wheels have enclosed bearings, while road pulley wheels don't. Enclosed bearings means a fraction of a watt of power is lost to resistance. Not a big deal for touring, randonneuring. 

Probably your bike, as an entry level bike, allows you to sit in a -relatively- upright position. This is probably a good thing! It takes a lot of training and practice to build up the muscles to ride in lower position - and as one ages (ex-pros included) it gets increasingly hard to maintain a low position. If you try to maintain a lower position than you are capable of - you will go slower not faster. You will feel tired and uncomfortable, suffer neck, back, arm, and hand pains. You may end up riding less because it is so painful. The more pain you feel, the less power you will output, which will result in more weight and pain on your hands, in a kind vicious circle. Is your stem currently in the upside down position? If not, try putting it upside down (e.g. -6 instead of 6) and see how it feels. You might try putting it at -6 and doing HIT (high intensity training) for as long as you can, then change back to +6 for a more leisurely ride. Of course if your fit is not right to begin with now - then you benefit from a better fit. But that is not a bike quality/expense issue, it is a fit issue. And again I emphasize, the correct fit changes depending on power output / length of ride. (I have two bikes, a carbon fiber with with a low position for power rides less than 3 hours long, and a steel cross bike for everything else. I guess its an older cyclists version of reading glasses and driving glasses!) 

This isn't uncommon in our neck of the woods. If you're a light packer, taking your bike the the airport can be a huge money saver. If your airport doesn't have a bike locker, bring two trusty u-locks with you. Use one u-lock to secure your front wheel and down-tube to one pole, and the other u-lock secure your rear wheel to another pole (please, never use a cable lock unless you're hoping to file an insurance claim for your bike when you get back into town). Try not to use your favorite bike if you have more than one. Either leave fancy accessories and lights at home or take them off and take them with you when you arrive at the airport. If your seat post uses a quick release, I would recommend replacing it with a bolt-on clamp. This won't guarantee your seat (or other bolted on parts) is safe from a well prepared perpetrator, but the majority thieves are looking for a quick and easy score, and will skip over your well-secured components in favor of lower hanging fruit.

Cyclocross bikes value a different set of priorities than road bikes. You want your cyclocross bike to have wide grippy tires so that you have good traction in all of that mud. You also want more clearance around your stays so that said mud doesn't build up too much there. You also want to have a wider wheel base and more clearance for easier maneuvering through the courses. Road bikes aren't strictly lighter, a carbon fiber cx bike might easily be lighter than some aluminum road bikes. But yes, in general you want to lose as much weight as you can if you're going to be racing that road bike up all of those enormous hills. With all of that maneuvering, another great feature on a lot of cross bikes are the cheater breaks 

I'd like to introduce another axis: Tire material. Soft grippy material vs. Hard less grippy material. The Soft grippy material has the advantages on grippiness, smoother riding, less rolling resistance, but has the disadvantages of getting more flats (for the same thickness of material) and of wearing out faster. The reason for getting more flats for the same thickness of material is that the less grippy tire is more likely to deflect a sharp object, and is harder to penetrate. Generally speaking, racing tires tend to use soft grippy material, and not much of it, to keep the tires light. Conversely, training tires tend to use the harder less grippy material, and lay it on thicker. Racing tires therefore grip better, are lighter, and ride smoother. The only problem is they wear out faster. If your are a light body weight short distance rider (going hard for an hour, say) riding on smoother roads that may be acceptable as you wear them out in 6 months. But if you are a heavy body weight rider doing a lot of long distance riding on rough roads, you may be wearing out those tires every month or two, and that gets expensive. An alternative is a grippy softer tire with thicker material. Maybe 100 grams heavier than a racing tire, but just as grippy and smooth and lasts twice as long. There are two very popular road tires which together I see on over half of all bikes around where in live in California where the roads are not smooth. One is the thicker soft grippy tire, one is the harder less-grippy tire. Both are made by the same company. (I won't mention the company or the tire names as I think that violates rules). I've used both, and harder tire lasts about twice as long. But I prefer the softer tire for comfort, and I believe it is faster as well. The only (semi-)competitive riding I do is long distance (generally over 100 miles). Yet another axis is the presence of a puncture resistant band built into the tire. There is a huge variation in effectiveness of these bands, but the really effective bands tend to make the ride very hard and increase rolling resistance. I've used a pair such "puncture-proof" tires for mixed terrain riding - only one puncture where a goats head came in from the side bypassing the band. Apart from that months without puncture, even though the rubber on the tires looked as though it had been attacked by a mountain lion - cuts and deep scratches everywhere. Nowadays there are also tubeless tires. But that's beyond the scope of my comment. 

Yes, absolutely. Spend an extra 20 dollars on good tires and you could save yourself 30 dollars worth of tubes. Plan on spending somewhere around 40 to 50 dollars a tire. Even if tubes were free, the money is worth saving the hours spent on the side of the road dealing with flats. Look for tires in the 'training' or 'commuting' category, for extra puncture protection. It should go without saying, take care to stay within the rated PSI of the tire when pumping it up. $URL$ 

When you are riding along on your own you're not only pushing the air in front of you out of the way, the most obvious source of air resistance, but you're also being slowed by the turbulent air behind you. However slightly. Surprisingly, having someone draft you will help smooth out that turbulence, and so you benefit as well! ( Just make sure they take their turn in front ). $URL$ 

Take the shifter cable out and lubricate it, or replace it if it looks like it needs to be replaced. If the pivots are as well maintained as you say they are, it could be the cassette that needs to be replaced. Most of the time you change an old chain, you need to change the cassette for things to continue to be smooth. From what you describe, the SX410 is super old, it might be worth it to have a mechanic take a look at it to make sure its properly greased. Once you've properly ruled out those problems, then try the Campy.
