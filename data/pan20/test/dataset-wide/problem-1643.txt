I add this, as these individual effects of religiosity may be measurable, but perhaps religiosity on the societal level, or at least various forms of it, are not correlated in the same manner, at least with external/societal benefits. 

Well, I heard an interesting one tonight. My wife passed on that on a blog discussing contraceptive use, someone posted a link to a site stating that taking Ortho Tri Cyclen, an oral contraceptive, "ages" the cervix prematurely. The implication was that if a younger woman takes the pill, her cervix could end up being of an "age" of an older woman, thus preventing pregnancy when desired (and when taking oral contraceptives is stopped). I had a heck of a time trying to research this on my own. 

I've been sent chain emails about pornography industry revenues and was quite flabbergasted by some of the figures. The version I recalled hearing was that pornography brings in more revenue than all US sports franchises combined. I looked around for some quotes so I could ask about this here, and it turns out that there are several related stats, so I included them all: Bigger than all sports franchises in the US combined: 

It's hard to qualify "moderate"... I have used it less than 10 times in my entire life. The most was for chicken pox and perhaps some bug bites when I was a kid. Let's cap usage as topical application to the skin in approximately 2.5cm diameter blots applied to 10 spots on the body for three consecutive days and doing this once per month. Doing an insanely rough calculation, if the application coating thickness is 0.5mm (pretty darn thick, in my opinion), this would be (pi x 2.5cm^2 x 0.05cm) x 10 spots x 3 consecutive days x 12 months = 141.3 cm^3 / 141.3 mL / year applied topically. 

Synopsis: follow the manual's recommended oil change schedule, not the 3,000 mile recommendation that has become commonplace advice. To translate that into some figures, I looked around for publicly available service manuals (just a few as I don't want to take all my time with this...): 

See Table 11.11 in Chapter 11 (LINK) for a breakdown of emissions by fuel type. Buses primarily use diesel, while cars primarily use gasoline; the emissions for these two aren't all that different, with diesel at 10,000 grams/gallon emitted and gasoline at 8,800 grams/gallon. 

I searched google scholar for the named professor in the video, Dr. Yuji Ohya (see his web page on the Kyushu University site). Searching for him there reveals that he is quite well published in areas of fluid mechanics and modeling/simulation. In any case, searching "Yuji Ohya lens" brought me to what appears to be his published work on this concept: Ohya Y., Karasudani T. A Shrouded Wind Turbine Generating High Output Power with Wind-lens Technology. Energies. 2010; 3(4):634-649.. The full text is available for download at that link. Notable quotes from the text follow below. 

Table 1 from the paper, showing the potential variations between speaker and listener for two opinions, A and B, is shown here: 

Alternatively, are there known instances where a military organization produces something like this in order to deceive others as to its real technology directions (there's no intention of working on MAVs, but it is desirable to make other groups think they are)? 

Now, I really, really, really wish they had isolated their variables. I don't know why they considered it necessary to vary the braking style and top speed in these cycles. There's at least some indication here, though, that accelerating faster decreases fuel economy. I consider "flooring it" to be a subset of "accelerating faster." 

Here is data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics for "Aircraft pilots and flight engineers" (SOURCE): 

My wife was just at a grocery store and a checkout girl told her that calamine lotion (zinc oxide + ferric oxide) had been correlated to kidney failure. My wife was going to get it for my daughter who has some mosquito bites and this checkout girl's statement caused her to get some far more expensive clay stuff instead. This just sounded absolutely absurd to me, so I thought I'd ask about it here. In my searching, I can't find any references elsewhere to calamine (or caladryl, its other name) and kidney failure. About the only thing I can turn up is a connection between cadmium and kidney failure, such as this quote from Medicine Plus, a service of the US National Library of Medicine: 

So, it seems to depend on the usage efficiency of the vehicle. I also note that the rail figures in Table 2.12 shows that "rail" travel does better than cars, so whatever circumstances are surrounding that mode may be of interest. Lastly, suggested by @Ian, is that this comparison doesn't take into account the travel by individuals to the public transport departure location. This could be neutral in the case of walking, but it could be optimistic if folks are driving cars to a pickup location. 

My wife is often telling me that drinking coffee later in the day will lower my "quality of sleep." Is this so? For an example of a bit beefier of a source for this claim, consider THIS blog post, featuring the following: 

No, in "real life," this [probably] does not happen While the paper establishes what it says... it is based on computer simulated social networks and does not track with actual human behavior/psychology. 

A histopathological study of 643 cutaneous horns, British Journal of Dermatology. This paper looks at characteristics that indicate whether the horn was derived from malignant epidermal lesions. It doesn't say much about the horns' characteristics; I'm listing it only to show that documentation exists for at least 643 (what I consider a lot) of these cutaneous horns. 

The claim in whole, "that caffeine causes auditory hallucinations," seems to be false. Initial results didn't turn up much; I searched "caffiene hallucination" on google scholar, which revealed THIS list. There was one result of interest, a blind study HERE, that found that caffeine given intravenously led to olfactory (smell) hallucinations. In any case, the actual study, published in the journal, Personality and Individual Differences, is found HERE. Note the following characteristics: 

So, now we'll use the size of a breath, and concentration of alcohol in the air to determine the amount of vodka absorbed over time. We'll assume that the room is essentially sealed such that no alcohol vapor is removed. I won't drag this out. I ran such breath iterations in an Excel formula like so: 

This last study may suggest, again, that dark triad high-scorers are more apt to choose short term mating strategies vs. long term endeavors. 

Calamine, however, is zinc oxide, not pure zinc. It's not clear whether or not zinc oxide containing products suffer from the same potential risk of cadmium contamination as those containing pure zinc. Nothing from Wiki on zinc toxicity stands out to me as supporting this, nor does this page from Medicine Plus on zinc oxide overdoses. Is there any evidence that calamine lotion (aka caladryl) contains anything that might be positively correlated with kidney failure from moderate topical use? 

There's also a report just on the European Region (LINK) with this breakdown for the Russian Federation: 

Near Death Experiences in general To close up, I'll list some interesting material I found on NDEs in general. 

The site appears to go through about 10 various studies on second hand smoke, proceeding to illustrate why they don't show what they intend to show: that second hand smoke, does, indeed, cause cancer. For once and for all: Is there current good, non-flawed evidence from studies showing that second-hand smoke does cause cancer? 

ABS data on ownership stats $URL$ So, we see that families with all ranges of kids own pets all at rates above 50%. The same site also has a similar breakdown to the table above (values in percents): 

In terms of their sources, the WHO data comes from the The Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH), which the report says this about: 

Edit: This is stated verbatim below, but just so it's reiterated and clear (comments seemed to indicate it wasn't): 

An example of "near point convergence exercises" are "pencil push-ups," shown HERE, is the practice of taking a small object and moving it closely toward the nose. The patient tries to focus on it as it approaches; if/when the eyes cannot maintain the convergence, two images will form. This is not the same as alternating between extreme convergence and extreme divergence in order to improve vision. This is to assist those who have trouble focusing up close and tracking movement. 

It's a fairly common movie trope that when someone is being chased by dogs they will run through water to "lose their scent" and the dogs will no longer be able to follow the trail of the one pursued. If this is true to a degree, a sub question would be if it's possible to "re-pickup the scent" by tracing the perimeter of the body of water. In other words, is it just the connectivity of the trail that's broken, or is the scent lost for good during this particular pursuit? 

I was out to breakfast with a friend today and he's started on the "Karen Hurd diet." I've heard of this dietitian before in my circles and several follow her like a savior. In fact, when my wife was pregnant with our first, she was told that Karen Hurd had a "cure" for morning sickness: soluble fiber. This morning I found out that Karen also has a cure for high cholesterol (drum roll): soluble fiber. I've looked into this a bit before, particularly when my wife was nauseous. She brought home a writeup of Karen Hurd's theory and I didn't buy it (this was about 3.5 years ago). 

It appears that the goal was to eliminate common hangups with misunderstandings that occur as a result of syntax, not as a result of being imprecise or misleading. Thus, again, the answer may depend on what you're asking. It appears that their goal was always to eliminate syntactic sources of ambiguity and that they have succeeded in doing so, as shown through the success of parsing the language with a compiler. 

So, it seems that despite not getting to bed before midnight at all, the study shows the night owls fared just as well or better as early birds on measures of alertness. The post concludes with the caveat that outside the lab, some who are prone to night-owl activities might not have the luxury of a noon wake up time, and thus do worse if they heed the desire to stay up late while also being required to get up early. I looked around for more, but this was the best I found that seemed like it could try to answer the question based on some metric (alertness throughout the day) to look at simply the time of day of sleep while keeping duration constant. If there were more, I'd be quite interested in: 

Questions: So, I'm curious. Is cohabiting increasing the probability that those who move forward from it to marry will divorce? Is any sociological/psychological mechanism known for why this might be? Are there credible sources with views divergent from those above? From an intuitive point of view, I'd wonder why cohabiting might give couples a period of time to work out potential conflicts that might arise from constant close contact and interaction rather than entering blindly and being surprised/overwhelmed. 

If you read the previous text, this study examined the efficacy for reducing myopia (nearsightedness, which requires glasses to see things at a distance), which I'll group in the "better vision" category. As I stated in the intro, these sources do mention convergence improvement techniques may be valid, but I'm not sure how that translates into practical details -- are reading glasses prescriptions able to be reduced, for example? In any case, convergence exercises is not what you're describing here, and so it's somewhat irrelevant. You are describing an alternating convergence/divergence exercise, and it does not appear to be supported by the literature. 

The fact that anything related to eloquence is mentioned in addition to knowledge of the subject matter alone shows that eloquence is a component, and thus given two speakers: 

That's comforting, though I'd suggest perusing that paper, as it quite clearly shows a direct relationship between road roughness values and vehicle damage -- in other words, the bigger the "bump" (or the more of them there are), the higher the probability of damage. I'm not sure if this really answers the question after all. It seems that several factors come into play -- age of the vehicle, stress history (how much roughness has already been accumulated), weathering, and size of the particular bump to encountered. I must call this answer to a close right now, but may edit it later as I think the best answer to this question will involve a discussion of probability of failure, which may assist in making a prediction on individual cases based on input criteria. For now, it seems that auto manufacturers do a fairly rigorous job in pre-testing vehicles to find out where things will wear, and there is a definite scientific interest in simulators and analysis, as I've found in the literature. In the end, these are mechanical systems, and the will fail -- thus, I think this question is about the likelihood of failure, not necessarily a purely yes or no answer. Based on what I've seen, however, for a new car I don't think you need to worry. But the more bumps one flies over, the higher the fatigue stress that is added to each part, thus increasing the probability of failure down the road compared to having taken it slower. In any case, I still hope that the answer helps. 

My one year old daughter picked up a typical plastic supermarket grocery bag and I watched her with it briefly before taking it away, as it's common knowledge that kids aren't supposed to have plastic bags due to a risk of suffocation. After actually seeing a child with a bag, however, I wondered how much of a risk this actually is. I had a very hard time imagining my daughter being able to get her head inside of the bag to such a degree that she would actually suffocate. I'm [hopefully obviously] not advocating for any controlled experiments here! I just wondered where this common, ingrained warning comes from. How real of a danger is it when children play with plastic bags? 

One would need the whole report to know what "social presence" and "intrasexual competitiveness" implies -- I'm reading this as dominating/confidence and attractiveness. Now quite the "dark triad" but perhaps related. At the very least we find that desires for "alpha" signals wane as relationship desires shift from short to long. 

Based on the data... YES, there are pilots' in the US and world wide being paid values that track with what Moore reported; if the conversions and data collection techniques are accurate for the non-US countries, many make much less, in fact. (Though, we have no idea what the standard of living, economies, etc. are like in those countries, either.) I don't think the question is particularly well phrased. Data supports some pilots making lower-than-expected amounts. We don't necessarily know their circumstances, size of the operations they work for, etc. Perhaps were Moore to interview only the top 10% of airline pilots we would be answering a question on this site about whether they really make $200,000 per year, as it seems so high. Statistical analyses should sample randomly to create an accurate distribution; Moore probably does not have this aim, despite whatever good objectives he was trying to fulfill with his documentary. Just some things to consider about the type of source.
