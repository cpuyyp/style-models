According to the chart, The GX long cage derailleur is good for an 11-42 cassette (Yellow triangle) and a 2x11 crank set (Light blue triangle). Also according the chart, all 1x11's should already be long cage derailleurs, but you may want to check the bike before you buy to be sure. 

Longer travel will change the bikes geometry. A 140mm travel fork has 60mm more travel, therefore needs 60mm more clearance. To get this, you need a smaller wheel or longer forks. Presuming you are sticking to the same wheels, you have to raise the sheerer height. The effect of this is a more relaxed sheerer angle - changing the handling for the bike. Personally I would not do it. The Hardrock is not a down hill bike, and never will be. With your target price, as you have observed - you get a lower travel higher quality fork. This would be far better. The fork will be stiffer and more robust, probably lighter and likely to be more adjustable. In your situation, I would put on the highest quality shock I could afford, and forget about increasing travel. I recommend 100mm to 120mm max. A well setup better quality short travel fork will walk all over a cheap long travel fork on all but the most extreme DH rides, and the compromise when not on those extreme DH rides is, well, extreme...... 

Upgrading parts is likely to be the most expensive way to get the bike you want. Depending where you are, second hand is the way to get a good bike for the lowest $$$, provided you are careful. The next least expensive option is to go for an end of season new bike. In the end, it costs a lot less if you use the proceeds from selling your old bike rather than upgrading it. 29'ers (I have one), give quite a different ride to a 26. Try one out to see if you like it, however if you stay hardtail, I think it's a good way to go. If you are a heavy 6'6, consider the 29'r has longer spokes and the wheels are therefore weaker than a 26 (all else the same). As I am under 70kg (150lb), its not something I have to worry about. Also think about the shock - is it stiff enough for your weight, although the only thing that makes a significant difference at this level of bike is more money, and unless you are over 250lb you should be OK (Trek states 136kg max fro their bikes). The Mamba looks like a reasonable fit for you in terms of budget and the riding you propose - it will hold up with OK quality parts, I imagine a bit heavier than ideal, but it won't be a dog either. Trek make good bikes and have a good reputation (where I live) for support - which is important. 

You say you want to learn bike maintenance. This is a very valid reason, and what you learn will pay what it costs many times over. I do however caution doing so on your current bike if it running well. Generally 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' is a good way to think about bikes upgrades. Upgrading a bike bit by bit is slow and expensive. Presuming everything is in good working order, the problem is that no one component will offer a noticeable improvement. Aside form regular maintenance, if you are patient enough, waiting till bits worn out or broken is the prudent way to learn. If you want to speed up the process, a better way to learn would be buy (or beg) a doer upper, and play with that. Start with one that seems to mostly work OK, and remove/strip/clean parts, replacing things like cables and chains as you go. Be careful not to spend too much on components though. An alternate would be start with a bare frame, and build a bike from bits. The compatibility issues will likely leave you with several boxes of leftover bits, but you will learn a lot. You will need a toolkit suitable for bikes- cheap ones that are adequate enough are available on EBay and Amazon and the like. They have most of the tools needed to work on most bikes. 

Welcome from a fellow Kiwi - love that area of the country. It should be a great ride - nearly all down hill and relatively flat, however keep in mind the short winter days make it difficult sticking to training schedules...... Between now an November you have heaps of time to get fit enough for the event. It's 160km for the full event - more than big enough to be a challenge - 9 hours is a pretty generous cut off time, - especially given the 600 vertical meter overall descent. The top riders are finishing around 4 hours, so if you can make half their speed you still have time up your sleeve. If I was in your shoes, I would start by pushing your training time out (preferably on the road, but wind trainer is OK to start with), until you can do 1 hour comfortable. I would use a heart rate monitor if doing indoor training to keep me honest. Outdoor I find it useful but not essential. I would drop to no more than 3 days a week (With 1 day between - never back to back days). Once you have comfortably gone an hour, something like Day 1 - Long ride - 5-10% longer each week, slower than race pace Day 3 - Medium ride - 70-80% of above, slower than race pace Day 5 - 30% of above at faster than race pace / sprints / interval training. Optional - Only if feeling good and drop the instant you have any symptoms of over training Day 2 - Nothing. Day 4 - Very slow, easy ride. Day 6 - Very slow, easy ride Day 7 - Very fast, short ride or sprints- no more than 1/2 hour - ONLY of feeling really good. The one key ride is the Day 1 - long slow distance. I would aim to be getting it to 140km about 3-4 weeks out from event. If you (honestly) aren't feeling up to it, don't train - over training is your worst enemy. You will drop training rides - it's OK. If you have more than 2 weeks layoff, then you will need to go back a few weeks and built up from there, otherwise, it won't hurt to miss a few, and will do more harm than good if you try to "make up" for it. There is lots of plans an information out there - read up on a couple and cherry pick what suits you. Be very aware there is a lot of pop-science behind many of these "plans" - base on extrapolating the results seeing a .0001% performance improvement in an elite athlete and then applying that to "You will go faster if you......." Essentially read up on our own Arthur Lydiard - his work in the 60's is the foundation of most training schedules today. It's essential to build endurance, then build speed.....
