I recently switched jobs and now the hours are pretty long and stressful. I still make time to workout in the morning for about a half hour every morning before I go to work. The only things I really have access to are 

So recently I started working out in the mornings at home. I'm wondering what kind of "gains" I will be able to witness from these types of workouts, if any. and not "witness" as in aesthetic necessarily but "witness" as in functional strength perhaps, aesthetics, health, etc... Background Worked out for a couple years prior, 1 year consistently. 5x5 program was most recent where I hit some PRs: 

Are you trying to get specifically agile for a competition? Or just increase overall agility? I would say, learn your body by doing explosive plyometric work, high-box jumps, rope slams, hit a light bag as fast as you can if you have access to boxing equipment. Heavy bag work dodges and jabs, cross work. If you have no access to HIIT equipment such as the high-box or ropes, nor do you have access to boxing equip, you could do explosive plyo at home, by clap pushups, kip pull ups, cross-fit may be a big benefactor to your overall agility development. 

Man, I know that the above exercises would add definition, you would have to go heavy for bulk. I like the shrug suggestion (try saying that three times fast)...but I would try doing some Farmers walks man...Intense whole body movement, works the hell out of your traps, shoulders, legs, core, forearm grip. Won't work your triceps or biceps too much, mainly stabilization, but wow will you get big doing these, keep the weight around 100-160lbs and go for a long walk. You won't regret it! 

I would say this only really applies to the bench, dumbbell or barbell... Your grip and positioning on the bench is too high. It's probably more around your upper chest. Here's what I would suggest 

This is a result of bad form. Your butt is probably sticking up the air. Your achilles tendon and hamstrings are becoming sore because they are being stretched during your holds. First of all look at your body position. to start, lay down chin towards the floor, toes downward, directly downward, and rest on your elbows using your shoulder girdle to support your neck. when you lift and get into positionput your weight directly on your elbows which should be ok, stick your legs straight out and remain on your tip toes, do not try and force the sole of your foot to the ground, the most that should touch is your fore-foot. Nothing more. Furthermore, you should be able to set a broomstick on your back and it should remain parallel with the floor and you. Your butt should be in line with your body, and you should be bracing your core, tucking your hips in. I saw a similar case of the same regions being sore, when my girlfriend tried to do burpees during some HIIT for the first time. She just wasn't jumping down far enough, the result was her butt stuck up in the air, hamstrings and back of shins were sore for a week. Make some adjustments to your form, straighten out, brace your core, and tuck your hips, it's not just your back that needs to be straight it needs to fall in line with the rest of your body to promote thoracic extension. Best of luck. 

Mycoprotein is a plant-based protein that carries a strong/full amino acid profile. It is supposed to be better for you because there is no cholesterol and is rich in vitamins and minerals. Your question, however, is will this specific kind of protein improve performance in swimming or muscle development? In short, yes, but in general no, and let me explain. Yes, protein supplementation should assist in muscle development but probably more so on the recovery end, especially as a vegetarian. However, would it have any more benefit over any other soy based protein such as Spirutein or Hemp Protein? Probably not. Protein supplementation is to hit macro nutrient ratios based on your training regimen, body-type, and goals. Will it improve swimming performance? It's possible, but it's also possible several other supplements including supplements with other types of proteins will improve swimming performance. If you're a vegetarian, protein is tough to get, however, I think in general you would need a more profound source of carbohydrates to boost your performance in the pool. Lean protein such as Mycoprotein is a great addition to your diet, but it won't directly affect your swimming performance unless you're training properly and building muscle. The combination of Protein supplementation (in general) plus a well balanced diet, and energy source - along with your training will be your best bet and getting better. Hope this helps. 

It shouldn't take as long as the first time getting into it. The benefit you have now is that muscle memory is there. In essence, your muscles have adapted and can now "remember" the movement to perform the exercises you once performed. So when you go back to it, that whole element of learning the movement is gone. This will hasten your results. However, intensity is important and is solely up to the individual. If you're going back into weightlifting, and your intensity is not there, you're not going to reap the rewards of the muscle memory. I'm sure some people will debate this, but keeping your diet in check is also going to be a huge attribute to your success. Depending on your goals, to lose weight for example, start with a 500 calorie deficit. Use a tracker like myfitnesspal - this will ensure that you don't go overboard on your caloric intake. Calorie tracking + intense workouts + muscle memory = results. Previously achieved results are subjective, I noticed after a 6 month break, I came back to the gym doing 2 compound lifts (i.e. bench + deadlift, or squat + pull up) per workout with accessory exercises....I got my results back and was stronger within 1 month of 3 workouts per week. Again, it's about intensity. Hope this helps! Best of luck! 

I read the article, as an advocate of Intermittent Fasting for the past 4 months or so. It makes sense, and basically states that the inclusion of BCAA's post and pre-workout are beneficial to preventing the catabolic state that your body can go into during intense workouts without the immediate nutrition we are all so accustomed to. Your questions: would the inclusion of two egg whites pre-workout improve my workout? It depends, are you already supplementing with BCAA's? If not, then it's possible it will give you a slight boost in energy levels. If you are supplementing with BCAA's already and are looking for a switch, well - according to the article it's a positive one as the small amount of protein will boost your circulating insulin levels, keeping you out of any sort of catabolism, but not spiking your insulin to the point that you break your fast. I mean I guess this is the controversial part. I don't believe that your body will go catabolic in hours. So with that in mind, I find myself asking how or why your workout would improve. According to Dr. Loren Lockman, your body will go after adipose tissue first. Which is long term fat storage, or the fat on your body. If this is the ultimate goal of your workout, then I think you would be best with BCAA's, although based on the findings, BCAA's and Egg whites are going to both give idealistic benefits. I would also point out that BCAA's are derived and produced with the intention of using during intense workouts to fuel your muscles. Egg whites are natural and not produced by anyone, so for a more natural approach I would say the Egg whites are your best bet. The BCAA's may work faster, as also mentioned in some of the comments in the article, the egg may take hours to activate protein synthesis, and it's more of a continuous process than BCAAs which enter your blood stream within a half hour. We're all in this for the long run. I think your choice to use intermittent fasting as a tool for weight loss and lean muscle gain is a good one. In reality, I think the change is minimal, and probably won't make too much of a difference. You don't have to worry about breaking your fast early, because as long as your training is intense, you will deplete glycogen anyway, and your body will raise HGH post-workout. Just don't eat any more egg whites then. BCAA's are OK though. Might of rambled a bit, I apologize. This is all from personal experience, and research. I've been interested in the same types of things. Bulletproof coffee would be your best bet as a morning pre-workout/fuel 

Being that you seem to be a novice at low-intensity exercise. Walking is a great step in the right direction. Exercise as simple as walking can improve cardiovascular health, increase mobility, and at 3 miles should have a positive metabolic response. Usually walking any distance is one of the easiest things a person can do but there are several factors that could bare some limitations on your little adventure. Feet Are you flat-footed? Do you wear shoes with arch supports? Do you not have arch supports? Have you had any injury to your legs or feet that would involve overcompensation in your lower leg muscles? Weight If you are carrying over 100 lbs of additional body weight this could be cumbersome on muscles when brought into practice. Calve muscles should naturally be somewhat strong unless you lead a sedentary lifestyle. Terrain What kind of terrain are you walking on? streets, sidewalks? trails, mud puddles? Where are you walking? If you can be honest with yourself about the above issues, and do a self-analysis on how, where, and why you're walking 3 miles a day. Then you can proceed to develop those calf muscles as mentioned above. Eliminate the pain In order to eliminate some of the pain you are currently experiencing, you could soak in Epsom salts, half cup salt/2 quarts water is my personal recipe, works wonders on sore joints and muscles. Do some stretching of those hamstrings and calves by sitting down on a yoga mat or floor, with feet straight out in front of you, no bends at the knee, put your arms above your head, also straight up, and bring them slowly down to try and touch your feet, hold on to your shins if you can't reach toes, flex toes backwards towards your fingers to stretch the calf. You can also do: 

While trying not to get too confusing here. The ultimate goal of ANY weight training session is to push the body to perform. By performing I mean struggle. If you're not struggling by the end of your set, you're probably only building muscular endurance and not strength. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it depends on your goals. Another factor worth noting is Progressive Overload. If you continue to do the same weight for each set "with hard work", your body will eventually adapt and get used to that weight. In which case you will need to increase the weight. Your question is directed at HOW you increase the weight. To this I say it depends on your method of progressive overload. If you're doing pyramid sets for example, you can increase the weight as you decrease the reps in the same set. If you're doing a 5 x 5 strong lift. You're going to do the same weight every set, until the following week where you increase 10lbs or so. This is SET BASED progressive overload, oppose to REP BASED All in all, some claims say one way is better than other, but for anyone who is just starting out, I would say as long as you are overloading the body with resistance, it will get stronger to deal with this increase in resistance. So really it's a personal choice for said trainer. Hope this helps! Best of luck! 

Went on vacation came back and started a new job that requires additional travel time, which keeps me out of the gym. put about a month in between my "real" workouts and any strength training I decided to start building up my home gym. Here's what I have: 

Two major issues for me were core and flexibility in my Lats. I would say that you should focus on more core work which have a variety of different exercises that can help. First I would foam roll lats before attempting any front squats. Not sure what you're currently doing, but a huge reason why my front squat was lagging so much. Usually as I got the weight heavier, the stress on my arms in the hole would be too much mixed with a weak core and as I went to get up out of the hole, my elbows would drop from traditional front rack position and the weight would be too much to support on my arms forcing me to bail. Push your elbows up on the way up to make sure the weight stays front racked. Loosening up your lats will help with this. Just keep working in that rep range and keep front squatting. Add core work in the form of hanging leg raises, knees to elbows, sit-ups, planks, etc. 

I wouldn't settle for marketing hype. Supplementing with protein is good. I think there are other methods that utilize a program like this too: Herbalife for example has you drink a meal replacement shake which has 20 or so grams of protein in it. I supplement with protein when i need to meet goals for my macronutrients and calories. Soemtimes it's just easier to make a shake with 30grams of protein than it is to make a cheeseburger, and it's a much cleaner option also...If you are counting calories and monitoring your macros, the protein supplement will help you get that 30-50% protein you're going for without too much extra. If this is not the case, and you are just having a "healthy shake" as a snack in addition to your 3 - 6 squares...well...caloric surplus = bulking. If you want to lose fat, I would look into possibly altering your lifestyle, instead of supplementing it. Perhaps give intermittent fasting a try, there are different styles to suit your needs, helped me lose 10lbs of fat, and replace with lean muscle mass at 5'6" and 175 lbs. This is in a maintenance phase of 2300 calories a day. Or, perhaps try to get into a Paleo style of eating with/without supplements, this will help you keep your overall caloric intake low (hard to eat 2000 calories worth of veggies and meat)...if you want to use supplements while on Paleo I see nothing wrong with that, other than it might not be straight Paleo. Play around with your calories and lifestyle changes. See what works best. Best of luck to you! 

I would say this is mostly CORE, shoulders, lower back intensive. Exercises that would increase mobility and strength include: Yoga - stretching flexibility core stabilization Core work - planks, weighted crunches, leg lifts, hanging leg raises Military presses lateral raises - work your delts and traps for stabilization to hold that position. The movement. Getting into position is probably the hardest part of this. You can start by standing a little less than a body length away from a wall. Get in the starting position with your head tilted down and your hands palm down on the floor. I believe you start sitting. Place your hands directly under you and practice holding yourself up, pushing up off the ground, hold and repeat. Get a chair and place it behind you, or use the wall as mentioned previously. With your hands in the same position as the starting position, kick your legs up to the chair or a low point on top of the wall, hold, repeat. This should be like the half way point, maybe a little less than half way point. I think your main goals for this is to get your core in shape. If those core exercises are too extreme, maybe you could try pelvic tilts, or other core activating exercises so you know what it really feels like. This is probably just a start. Good luck! 

Low-carb dieting or carbohydrate restriction is used primarily to reach ketosis. Ketosis occurs when your body is drained of liver glycogen, and it resorts to using your already or pre-existing fat stores for energy. Free Fatty Acids. You can only start to burn these FFA's when your insulin levels are low, for example, when you wake up in the morning, you've been fasted for say 8 hours, you wake up insulin levels are low, you eat a bagel for breakfast, spike your insulin, it stays high for 3 hours, then you eat again, keep insulin high, repeat. If insulin is high, then fat-burning is low. Also consider, if you wake up and eat a carbohydrate laden breakfast before you work out, you must first burn through those carbohydrates (they are released as immediate energy) before you even touch any of the fat on your body. Contrary to popular belief your body will not "starve" from low-carb dieting for a minimum of 3 days, depending on size metabolism, exercise schedule, etc. From here, you're still not technically "starving" like the holocaust, but your body has now turned to catabolizing your muscle for fuel. You're basically sending it a signal that food is scarce (keep in mind, 3rd day), and the human body's reaction is to go into a hibernation like mode, where it starts to eat away at the body for energy. If you choose to do a carb-restricted diet, you would want to re-feed (have a high carb day) once per week to restore your bodies accustomed carbohydrate processing. Essentially the point of low-carb is to restrict your carbohydrate intake so drastically that your body starts to burn fat, and stays in that fat burning state for a duration of time to see results. Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to do unless you're very strict, and determined to do this. All you're doing is keeping your insulin low, so HGH (Human Growth Hormone) can be raised, which in turn burns fat, and creates an anabolic environment in your body. This can also be achieved by working out (burns all the glycogen, make sure you don't eat post workout to keep this fat burning going), fasting (religious or intermittent), as well as low-carb, or carb cycling. I am a fan of intermittent fasting. I don't like teasing myself with micro-meals 4-6 times per day. I don't like counting my carbs, so I just don't eat breakfast, don't eat post-workout, and I stay burning fat. It's actually working so well, I can't even bulk in a surplus. Very hard to gain weight at this point. Keep up the hard work, you're doing the right thing by searching for the answers. Good luck mate!
