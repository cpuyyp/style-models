I find it fascinating that the modern English word "salary" (pay to a worker) derives the Latin "salarium", itself deriving from the Latin "salis" for salt. Whether Roman soldiers were actually paid in salt sometimes (quite debatable), they often would have bought salt with their pay, given its utility and valuable nature. Either way, this notable etymology, along with a number of common modern quotes in English, alone provide good support for the precious role salt once played in civilisation. Some interesting facts about the role salt as played in human history (including quotes). 

The Incident at Pristina Airport, 12 June 1999, following the war in Kosovo, was a direct stand-off between NATO and the Russian Federation. Despite a desire (and order) for engaging in combat by SACEUR Wesley Clark,the incident passed without bloodshed allegedly after some strategic insubordination by now-crooner James Blunt. 

Chickering suggests that bonds were seen as a patriotic sacrifice and they were nominally honoured but their value reduced by inflation: 

They could do this because they issued bonds in their own currency to a largely domestic audience and transitioned off the gold standard to a fiat currency during the war, as explained in this article. 

Pre-dating the usage of spies by the Persians is (perhaps unsurprisingly) the Ancient Egyptian use of spies and military intelligence, from at least the New Kingdom period (late 2nd milleniunm B.C.) onwards, but quite possibly even from the Old Kingdom. period (early 3rd millenium B.C.), as suggested by the reference to "early Pharaohs" in the following source. This source describes the ancient usage of spies by the Egyptians, and lists evidence as hieroglyphs discovered in Egypt. 

Additionally, if anyone has information on any Celtic subgroups that fall outside of the common Gaelic/Brythonic divisions (for example the Anatolian Celts?), I would be most interested to hear of such. 

These two examples show that after engaging populations in total war, border controls become strengthened. After World War II, in 1947, the regulation of passports was given to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations. Visas Visas are more complicated and may be required for entry and/or exit to a particular country or for particular purposes (e.g. work or leisure travel). The rules governing them are essentially a bell-weather of the relations between states. Indeed, friendly nations often participate in visa-free arrangements, particularly for tourist travel. Such arrangements have been developed at different points in time. Many nations also operate a visa-on-arrival policy (essentially just a requirement for payment), though it may depend on citizenship. As with the aftermath of WWI, the aftermath of WWII and up until the 1960's, was a time of great upheaval as empires crumbled and nations found their independence, particularly in Africa. Malcolm X It is not clear that Malcolm X was free to enter Saudi Arabia without a visa in normal circumstances. Indeed, his wikipedia article states that he had significant trouble entering and after some time entered as a state guest rather than a regular traveller. 

All contributed to increase oligarchy and eventual pseudo-monarchy in the Roman Empire. The natural response to the many crises that occurred over the first century B.C. was to put power in the hands of great individuals; a dangerous move at any time, despite it having some logic. No doubt, the spiral towards collapse had begun long before Caesar's heydey. Worth noting: the first Emperor Octavian cunningly maintained the pretence of the Republic's continuation, gradually dropping it towards the end of his reign. Now there are of course other explanations, and I have only touched on the surface here, for it is a highly complex subject, but I hope this gives some insight for you to go and read around the matter further, at least.

Passport standards were defined in two conferences organised by the League of Nations, one in Paris in 1920 and another in Geneva in 1926. It is important to note that nations and the boundaries were significantly reconfigured in the aftermath of WWI and that enforcement of new boundaries would have helped define and legitimise these new entities to some extent. The Government of Canada affirms this point, but also states that passports and visa were common for travel in Europe, but the advent of rail travel made checking such documents infeasible and they were phased out in the mid to late 19th Century, before being reinstated for security reasons from WWI in what was seen as a temporary measure. 

During the era when the Phoenicians ruled the Mediterranean sea and surrounding territories (cerca 1550 - 300 B.C.), salt was indeed a highly precious commodity. After this, the Romans became the dominant force in the Mediterranean, though the value of salt did not immediately decline by any means. Whether it was pound-for-pound as valuable as gold, I think it is hard to say, but probably not out of the question at some point. Until relatively modern times, salt was prized mainly for its ability to preserve foodstuffs as well as season food. In the hot Mediterranean climate where fish and meat would decay rather quickly, this was particularly useful. The period of Phonetician domination during the early to mid first millennium B.C. (including its successor state Carthage) represented one of the world's first monopolies. Essentially, other nations (including Ancient Greece and early Rome) did not have great access to salt, and hence the Phoenecian monopoly could dictate its own outrageous rates. From this article on the economy of the Phoenicians: 

These things come and go, as convenience and fear vie for attention in the public consciousness. I will extend to question to include passports, as there is an essential link between passports and visas, though they have somewhat different functions. Passports are essentially identity documents and general requests for safe travel from the government of the holder's country to the government of the place of travel. Visas are specific permissions to stay in a particular country and are used to more finely control what a person can do when travelling, exclude particular groups (e.g. criminals, certain nationalities) and to raise revenue. Visa requirements and costs are determined by security concerns, political expediency, trade agreements, and sometimes in a tit-for-tat manner. Passports In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, Keynes claims that is was the onset of World War I that borders began to be rigorously controlled, and documents began to be required for transit in modern Europe.
