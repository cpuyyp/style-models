I am probably going to get slammed for this, because it violates everything we were taught about tidal forces, but the antipodal tide is caused by the centrifugal force created by the Earth's rotation about the earth/moon barycenter, not differential gravitational forces. While the moon's gravity is less on the side of the earth furthest from it, that force is still towards the moon, not away from it.There is a good explanation of this centrifugal force explanation on NOAA's website here. I'll cite some pictures and pertinent text, but this site is a good read for anyone trying to understand the forces responsible for the Earth's tides.Here is a diagram showing the earth and moon's movement around the system's barycenter:And some of the pertinent text: 

You can generally see the unlit side of the moon when a considerable amount of sunlight is reflected off the earth. This reflected sunlight illuminates the unlit side of the moon. This is referred to as earthshine, and a decent explanation can be found at timeanddate.com. I seem to recall reading somewhere (but now can't find a reference) that it is more prominent when it is very cloudy on earth near where the moon is overhead. 

Once while camping with my family as a child we all watched a meteor shower in the summer (in the month of August). All the meteorites streaked across the sky in the same direction. Obviously, this was the result of the Earth passing thru a group of meteors but I've always wondered. Do meteorites always streak in the same direction? While I know it's not likely to be exactly the same direction, but generally speaking. Would one say meteorites always travel for example: ? I thought this was a plausible fact since the Earth is travelling around the Sun in a constant direction, and additionally it's always rotating in the same direction. While meteorites can travel in all directions. Does the Earth's gravity pull them straight down towards the surface resulting in the streak to be always in the same direction. 

There are many documented cases of meteorites being reported as from Mars. $URL$ While I can understand that it's possible to know if a rock originated as a meteorite. What I don't understand is how scientists can say it came from Mars with certainty. How can they verify such a claim, and differentiate between a rock that is similar to one from Mars to one that really is from Mars. 

If the question is if the Sun is in f1 or f2, the answer is that it doesn't matter. Ellipses are symmetrical, and therefore both foci are equivalent and any naming of them is just conventional. Just by saying that planets move in elliptical orbits and the Sun occupies one focus, Kepler's first law is unambiguously established. If you need to mention a particular focus, one is just the Sun position and the other one is often referred as the empty focus. 

In addition to already present good answers, I would say that if we found life on Mars on a century there is a noticeably probability of it being made from Earth microbes accidentally taken there by one of our probes or their descendants. Risk of contamination of other planets is addressed by carefully sterilization of probes but no sterilization is complete, so there is always a small risk. 

The answer depends on your definition of a day. If you define a day as we usually define it in the Earth (time between the Sun is at noon or average time between sunrises, a 24 hours day in Earth), the length of a day in the Moon is the synodic period of the Moon and it takes 29.530589 days (29 d 12 h 44 min 2.9 s). Anyway, if you define a day as rotation on own axis, that is, time between a far away star being at noon, you have what in Earth is called sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes in Earth). In the moon the day defined this way would be 27.321661 days (27 d 7 h 43.19 min 11.5 s). Please notice that since the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, rotation periods equal orbital periods. 

Even if the LHC did create a black hole, its mass would be no greater than the sum of the particles that formed it, i.e. very tiny. It would evaporate almost instantly due to Hawking radiation. Secondly, subatomic particles have been colliding with atoms high in earth's atmosphere for eons, and we're still here. 

I have Googled "iridium content of comets" and can't find anything that suggests comets contain iridium in any detectable quantities. Yet, whenever I read an article about the Chicxulub impactor, the article invariably says something to the effect that it may have been created by an asteroid or a comet. But Alvarez and company first offered the impact hypothesis for the K-T extinction by observing an iridium layer in global sedimentary deposits, which could only have come from an asteroid impact, since iridium is extremely rare in the Earth's crust. Later the Chicxulub structure was identified as the probable site of the asteroid impact. While a comet could have caused the Chicxulub crater, it could not have been responsible for the global iridium layer. So why do science writers offer the comet alternative? If Chicxulub was created by a comet, then another site must have been the source of the iridium layer. 

In the original book, the classic 1962 movie and the modern 2001 re-make for TV. The store "The day of the Triffits" depicts a meteor shower that happen all around the Earth at the same time, and leaves everyone who sees it blind the following days. Given the nature of how the Earth rotates, moves around the Sun and a meteor field (required to create a shower of many meteorites). Is it really possible for such an event to happen everywhere at the same time? This is kind of an important plot in the story, because if one side of the planet goes blind first they can warn the other. 

I saw a very bright star in the night sky on Monday (Jan 30, 2017). The star was in the Western sky and was directly above the crescent moon. My location is Toronto, Ontario. Canada. It was about 8pm at night, but by 10pm the star had disappeared over the horizon. I'm sure this was a planet as it shined brighter then any of the other stars, but I couldn't guess which one. Can you identify this planet for me?
