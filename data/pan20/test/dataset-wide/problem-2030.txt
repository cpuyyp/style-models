I've worked for companies that had policies regarding this sort of thing, but I don't think there are any over arching labor laws. Some of these policies included things like: 

All you can really do is be honest about the situation. It may seem like your former employer is going to ruin you, but if you explain to your new prospective employer that things were copacetic before you resigned and that after giving notice the relationship soured, they may be understanding. My wife had a similar situation when she applied to her current job. She was more than a little worried about what kind of reference her former employer would give because, even though she was quite good at her job, she didn't leave on the best terms. When she explained the situation to her new boss, it turned out that her former employer had a well know reputation for throwing fits when people left his company. This may not be true in all cases, but within many industries people talk. And people tend to talk more when they've been burned be the same person in the same way. 

I'm struggling with a direct supervisor, who just doesn't seem to pull his own weight. Basically my supervisor is expected to be a "working manager", so his time is split between 15% administrative tasks and 85% doing the same job I do. I understand that he has admin responsibilities that pull him away from day to day tasks, no problem there, but it seems more and more that the quality of his work in the field is sub-standard. Which leaves the bulk of the work undone, or worse done poorly and the rest of the department is left to scramble to meet deadlines and fix his "mistakes". (To be clear, its not that I just have a high standards, he often scolds the whole department for things that he did, or didn't do.) It seems that any one of his subordinates can accomplish more in 4 hours than he usually gets done in 2 or 3 days. I'm thinking it may be time to make the higher management aware of the problem, before things boil over, but I'm unsure of how to approach the situation. Should I go to higher management with my concerns, and if so, how can I report the situation without coming across as in-subordinate? 

It's possible this guy was offering a low number because he doesn't value your type of work, but it could also be because he doesn't have the funding to do otherwise. Of course, if he's not offering any sort of equity then it's still a shitty deal (since one day he might sell this thing and cash out for millions and you'll still have your lowballed salary). But to echo the others no you didn't do anything wrong. Some people can't afford a pay cut or don't want to. Some people will take a pay cut in exchange for stock options or something. You don't sound like you want to either so be glad you dodged a bullet because if this is how he handles simple hiring practices then I can't imagine he'll stay in business long. 

You already have some excellent answers above, but I'm going to make one additional observation/suggestion. You have what sounds like a standard issue full time flat salary job. I've got one. Most people on this board have one. And judging by your statements you seem to be wanting to get paid more as a result. Or rather, you don't want to be working those extra hours for free. It sounds like the same thing but the added wrinkle is that compensation comes in forms other than money. I don't know what your financial situation or commitments are but it sounds like you'd be a pretty good fit for a startup culture. Crazy long hours, beyond-Puritan work ethic, deep personal investment in the company, it sounds like the sorts of things people in startups go through. Not to sound cliche but this is the sort of thing the guys on Shark Tank look for. The downside though is that startups frequently pay a lot less than standard full time jobs for established companies, and there's almost never any such thing as overtime pay. You would likely be taking a very substantial pay cut to join one, and this is why you tend to see younger people flocking towards them (i.e., people who maybe haven't yet entered into a marriage/mortgage/family situation). The perk though is that you are frequently offered stock options or ownership in the company as a result (sometimes called "sweat equity"). Back in the day people would work for Microsoft for $30k/year in Seattle and stock options. When Microsoft hit it big they cashed out and became millionaires. Of course that's assuming the startup succeeds. So it's a gamble. But it's an option. 

With that out of the way... I would assume that the higher management is unaware of the issue and would most likely take immediate action if/when they are informed. Even if the law wasn't being broken, a smart manager would have some serious concerns about safety and liability. There's a good chance that the company already has a policy concerning this sort of situation. If I were in your situation I would try to give the manager an opportunity to catch the trainer in the act. If you can manage that, there won't be any question about whether the smoking is happening on the job or after hours. 

Simply put... Believe it or not... Some people cheat. If the drug test is disclosed up front it gives people who are going to cheat an opportunity to do so. As mentioned in another answer, some people will just clean up for a few weeks before the test in order to pass. Others will try to use one of the never ending commercially available products to try to beat the test. Like it or not, it's a reality and a financial reality too. Sending people to a lab for testing isn't cheap, but employers often get discounts on insurance for doing so. They also do this to limit their liability. If you're ever injured on the job you can expect to be tested. If you fail, you'll lose your benefits and most likely your job as well. 

I agree with the consensus here that the client acted poorly. However, one additional detail that I latched on to in your story 

I would say if you live in an area with lots of tech jobs and lots of recruiters, just stop answering your phone when this guy calls. The odds are when you do need a job again, he will still be plenty glad to talk to you. Or he won't be doing this anymore. But either way unless he's the only recruiter in the area don't worry about burning bridges. In my experience the only thing that would piss off a recruiter bad enough to not work with you is if they placed you in a position and you never show up so they never get their commission (thinking commission-based recruiters here, not flat-fee ones). 

I think this is a clear sign that there's more to this story, and assuming the deal is that there's something they're not telling you (as opposed to something you're not telling us), I wonder if this is a sign that the company does not have the money to pay you with money in the form of a check, but may be willing to pay you in some debt-related fashion (i.e., maybe the items they'll buy for you will be put on a credit card). If the issue is that they want to pay you with a credit card and not with an actual check, maybe invoice them with PayPal or something? I've done this where the client is clearly paying me with a credit card via PayPal and there's a slight hit involved with PayPal fees (maybe adjust your invoice to account for it) but overall everyone's happy. I think it goes without saying that this company is not one you want to work for again. 

I've been dealing with a strange company culture issue. Very often we will see a problem coming weeks or months in advance. We usually try to prevent the problem from occurring by bringing the issue to the management's attention and by asking for preventative measures, but the attitude usually seems to be "Don't talk about the problem." This wouldn't be such a huge deal if they wouldn't later get upset about no one telling them about the problem. More or less we end up getting set up to fail because problems aren't discussed and thus aren't solved until it is too late. Its a bit like being on a train and seeing that the tracks ahead aren't finished. When you mention it to the conductor their only response is "Don't talk about the train-wreck..." yet when the train derails the conductor claims that no one told them the tracks weren't finished and shifts the blame. I understand that most employers prefer optimistic employees, but optimism doesn't lay train-tracks, or perhaps better put, optimism shouldn't replace due diligence and preparation. Is there a way to shift a company's culture toward open dialog and problem solving or better yet problem prevention? 

The root of humiliation is humility... It's an unfortunate situation, but try to be humble about the whole thing. If you overhear any further discussion about the matter laugh it off. Also... self deprecating humor can go a long way in taking the wind out of peoples jokes about it. Let them laugh with you rather than at you. "Well, I really shouldn't have trusted that and I really, really should have called in... let that be a lesson to all of you... Move along, nothing to see here." 

If you've automated yourself out of a job, your company needs to find more jobs for you to automate your way out of. 

I agree with the others in that you need to present the case properly, and also that if you're trying to help your company after you leave but they won't take your suggestion then it's no longer your problem. You tried. That said the one thing every company and department understands: money. I mean, money is I'm guessing the reason they won't buy the software (your question's wording is a little vague so I'm guessing about this part). And if it's cheaper to have people on staff to do the job than it would be to buy the software to automate their tasks then yeah, they're going to go that route, it's the most finanically rational. However if this isn't the case, if it would be better and cheaper to use the software then that's your angle. Same way if you had to write a video game it may be cheaper to license a game engine than it would be to hire a team of people to write it over however long it takes. Barring some sort of "not invented here" directive (justified or not) the way to make your case is money. If the issue is no one's going to do your job once you leave then explain how much money they're going to lose when things go wrong versus the costs of buying the software. 

Most of these things are just common sense and good business practice. Even assuming that a visitor is dropping in for business purposes, it's a good idea to make sure that they were expected and that you're prepared to greet them. 

To more directly answer the question... Yes it is harassment, and no it doesn't matter if you're gay. Though unfortunately in a lot of places people aren't protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Your best bet is to get out quickly and consider consulting an attorney after you've secured a new job.

To more directly answer the question... Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine. Be honest about your skills in interviews, keep working hard, and keep learning. 

It's also probably worth mentioning that fiberglass is but one of many potentially hazardous materials in your workplace. I'm sure there are also a number of chemicals, cleaners, and so on, that could also cause serious harm if not handled properly... 

$URL$ This seems like a pretty important contextual detail why was it edited out? I'm a little surprised that this hasn't been mentioned before, but donating your hair for this reason is a real thing. $URL$ I remember a number of girls, who I grew up with, growing out and then cutting off 10 inches of their hair for this purpose. It was sort of like their "ice bucket challenge" I can appreciate that you're not interested in cutting your hair, but this isn't necessarily gender based harassment or him picking on you. He may just be trying to raise awareness for a charitable organization... The easiest way to get him to stop is probably to just tell him something like: 

Something to add: there's a local large tech company in my area where the employees have an old saying, "it's the best first and third job you'll ever have" Meaning: there's rules in place on how large your salary can be and how much you can be promoted to that apply to existing employees, but not necessarily to people hired from the outside. For example, you might make $50k and your manager wants to promote you to a position where you can make $100k. However, the company has a rule: no more than a 50% pay increase. Which means you can't be raised to more than $75k. Crestfallen, you take a different job outside the company that offers you, say, $85k which is still less than the $100k you should have been promoted to but better than the $75k you were actually promoted to. After a few years though your original manager approaches you and can now successfully offer you the $100k because now you're no longer a current employee and so he can give you what the position deserves. It may sound stupid, and in the short run it probably costs the company some good employees, but in the long run it saves money (which is good for the accountants, stock holders, etc.) It also has one added benefit: it helps curtail the notion that managers can give giant raises to people they like based on things other than skill. I once worked a job at a company that didn't have this rule and we got a new director of our division one day and he brought in his crew of fellow coworkers from his old division and gave them all management positions with enormous raises and bonuses, despite their complete lack of qualifications. You can probably guess what happened next. So anyway the bottom line is that yes this is a thing, yes it may be antiquated or not properly account for highly demanded talent or what not but thems the breaks. You have to decide if you like the job or money more.
