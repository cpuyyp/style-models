This video, which shows time-lapse views of Earth from the ISS, consistently shows some sort of hard boundary in the atmosphere, below which there seems to be significant reflection from sunlight and/or Earth's cities and above which there seems to be nothing impeding the view of black space. What is this boundary? I don't think its the edge of the atmosphere, partly because the atmosphere has no hard edge and partly because the aurorae (an atmospheric phenomenon) seen in the video exist, at least in part, above this boundary. 

It seems to me that nowadays the more proper term is "Trans-Neptunian Object". Is there any difference between Kuiper Belt Objects and Trans-Neptunian Objects? If not, is one term preferred over the other? 

This article makes the claim that the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT, number 4 in the list) will have resolution 10 times better than that of Hubble, while the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT, number 3 in the list) will have resolution 12 times better than that of Hubble. These are claims I find impossible to believe. A simple application of, for instance, the Raleigh Criterion ($\theta = 1.22~\lambda/D$), where $\theta$ is the angular resolution of the telescope, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in question, and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope, would show that a comparison between angular resolutions is as simple as comparing the diameters of the telescope apertures. Hubble's mirror is 2.4 m; comparing with the 24.5 m GMT and the 30 m TMT we see that the GMT will have 10.2 times the angular resolution of Hubble, while the TMT will have 12.5 times the angular resolution of Hubble. I think a calculation similar to the one I have described is how the article linked above came up with the numbers they did about the angular resolution of these telescopes compared to Hubble. However, the Raleigh criterion only applies to telescopes working at their diffraction limit. Space telescopes (if they're designed well and built correctly) can work close to the diffraction limit (maybe even at the diffraction limit). Ground-based telescopes, however, are limited in angular resolution by the atmosphere, which at best will limit resolution to about an arc-second at the best sites on Earth. Thus the GMT and TMT by themselves will not have better image resolution than Hubble. My question, then, is whether this article is correct (possibly because of one of the reasons I list below) or whether it seems this article naively applied the Raleigh Criterion for angular resolution with no thought about how the atmosphere will affect the resolving capabilities of these large ground-based telescopes. Possible reasons the article may still be correct: 

In the vacuum of space the most important consideration is to consider how much radiation an ice cube would absorb from, for example, nearby stars and how fast the ice cube itself would radiate away energy (using Wien's law), finding what ice cube temperature would produce an equilibrium (the temperature at which the ice cube radiate energy at the same rate it absorbed energy) and then determining if that temperature is above or below the melting point of the ice cube. If it is above the melting point (of water in a vacuum), then as the other answers have said the ice cube would sublimate; if it is below the melting point then the ice cube would stay frozen. Specifically for an ice cube that is a cube in orbit around the sun with one side facing the sun you would need to calculate how much energy the side facing the sun absorbs from the sun as well as how much energy radiates away from all six sides of the cube and then find the equilibrium temperature. 

I understand that the kappa mechanism (that leads to star variability) causes an increase of opacity with increasing temperature in partial ionization zones. However, I'm not sure I understand what causes the increasing opacity with temperature. Until recently, I thought that the increasing opacity was due to increasing Thompson opacity due to the increasing ionization fraction with temperature in partial ionization zones. However, some things I read suggested that that was not the cause. So I wanted to ask, what is the cause of increasing opacity with temperature in partial ionization zones? 

I have never used stellar elemental abundances in this way, so I want to check a few things. First of all, is the logarithm used by this paper log$_{10}$ or log$_e$ (often written ln)? My guess is log$_e$ because of what follows. Let's say I want to calculate the elemental abundance of He relative to H. I believe the correct math would be to do the following $$\frac{\textrm{N}_{He}}{\textrm{N}_H} = \textrm{exp}(\textrm{A}_{He} - 12.0)$$ Is this the correct way to calculate the relative abundances? This equation gives a value of 0.343 for the helium abundance relative to hydrogen, which seems to be the correct value for the sun (the sun is usually quotes as being about 70% H and about 25% He, which gives a relative abundance of 0.357). This correct value is what leads me to believe that the log is log$_e$. 

How are orbits calculated for Trans-Neptunian Objects? I understand there are six standard parameters for defining an orbit (link) but I am not sure how telescope observations translate into these parameters. Telescope observations tell us where the object is on the Celestial Sphere but can't even tell us (without a good spectroscopic line to do a redshift analysis with) how fast the object is moving towards or away from us. Additionally, the motion of these objects on the sky is dominated by Earth's motion relative to the objects rather than the motion of the objects themselves. This seems to me to offer additional complications. My question is: how do 2-D observations get fit with a reasonable degree of accuracy to a 6-D parameter space with the additional complication of Earth's motion relative to the object? Don't be afraid to be mathematical in your response. 

A specific answer to your question is going to vary significantly from school to school. For example, some programs are very accommodating in letting students "pick and choose" what there want to do research in partly because there are currently resources available to allow that. As explained above, because of resources or other considerations some programs may not have the luxury of opening all doors for its graduate students. 

I am wondering how many free electrons per baryon and how many free electrons per atom there are in the solar photosphere. This number depends on the abundances of the various atoms found in the photosphere as well as each atom's ionization potential. The book "Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics" by Boehm-Vitense, vol. 2, 1997 reprint, on page 76 claims that one out of every $10^4$ hydrogen atoms are ionized, so hydrogen is mostly neutral in the photosphere; however, there are other heavier elements with lower ionization potentials. Boehm-Vitense goes through and calculates the fraction of ionization of iron but calculations for only two species present in the photosphere can hardly be considered comprehensive. Whether you calculate these numbers yourself or provide a summary of a reference (with a link to that reference if possible) that has more details about ionization in the photosphere it will be appreciated. My guess is that, since hydrogen has such a low degree of ionization, the number of electrons per baryon and per atom will be small, since hydrogen is the majority constituent of the photosphere. 

I am interested in figuring out which Messier globular clusters (plus 47 Tuc and Omega Cen) are in the Kepler/K2 fields, both fields that have already been observed and any that will be observed. Poking around online I was able to figure out that Campaign 2 of K2 observed M4 and M80, but I would like to get a complete sample of globular clusters that have fallen or will fall into the Kepler/K2 fields, especially the Kepler field. Are there online tools that could help me figure this out? 

I have seen several references that say that helium burning begins in a star once the core temperature reaches $10^8$K (such as here) but nowhere that says what density that corresponds to. Does anybody know a reference that has this value? And if it makes a difference, I would like to know the density for quiescent helium burning, not helium flash helium burning. 

As I understand it, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all made primarily from varying proportions of hydrogen and helium. Despite this, Jupiter is very red, Saturn is yellow, and Uranus and Neptune are blue. Why the difference in colors for planets with similar chemical makeups? Or do they not have similar chemical makeups? If such an explanation is available, I would like specific descriptions of why each planet is colored the way it is. 

I am wondering what the brightest individual star is in M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. Specifically, brightest as seen from Earth (so relative magnitude). 

Are there any differences between quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)? As I understand it, they are both caused by extremely luminous electromagnetic emission from material accreting onto a super-massive black hole. If they have the same source, is there still some fundamental difference between them (and if so what is it) or are they two names for the same thing? 

As seen from Earth, planets such as Mars and Jupiter exhibit retrograde motion when they are near opposition (from Earth). I am wondering how this effect extends to very distant objects, such as those in the Kuiper Belt. Since objects in the Kuiper Belt orbit the Sun at a velocity much slower than Earth (or Mars or Jupiter for that matter) because of Kepler's third law I'd imagine that retrograde motion for these objects is more extreme in the sense that these objects are seen to be in retrograde motion for a longer time and over a larger portion of the sky (in an angular sense) than would be seen for any of the planets. In an extreme case, is it possible that a very distant Kuper Belt Object (KBO) would never be observed in prograde motion? I imagine that if you were to observe a KBO that was in the direction of Earth's motion then there would be no contribution from the Earth's velocity on the observation and you would be able to see the object in prograde motion, no matter how slow it was travelling. However, such an object would likely be obscured by sunlight, since objects that lie in the direction of Earth's motion lie above the day/night interface on the Earth. My question here is that, given real-life observational constraints (like sunlight) how far from the Sun would an object have to be to never be seen in prograde motion? You can be mathematical. 

It's always made intuitive sense to me that a higher surface gravity leads to broader spectral lines from a star, but yesterday I realized that I don't have a physical explanation for why this is so. Why is this so?
