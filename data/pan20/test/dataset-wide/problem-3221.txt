For the most part, church and celestial events. In particular, midsummer and midwinter and the equinoxes were both easy to detect and were important events, at least in the colder climates of Europe. One problem with this approach was that the Julian calendar, which was used pretty much everywhere during the middle ages, by the 1500s had gotten seriously out of sync with the seasons (by about 15 days). Church was a natural mechanism for announcing Sundays (or Fridays or Sabbath, depending), and for disseminating news about upcoming holidays. Also don't underestimate the power of networking. If one village lost track of which day of the week it was (say, due to being preoccupied with a natural disaster), they would re-synchronize easily with nearby villages. Or, if they could not connect to anybody else, then the exact day and month may not have mattered much in the first place. Incidentally, not all parts of the medieval world necessarily agreed on the month and day in the first place, although that happened mostly after the church replaced the Julian calendar with the Gregorian one. Rome changed in the 1500s, but the rest of Europe changed at various times over the next 400 or so years. Russia didn't change until 1917, and the Orthodox church still hasn't changed (which is why Russian Christmas is on a different day). 

The definition of marriage itself has changed multiple times over the last millenia. Marriage wasn't always the formal recorded matter it is today, and in some cases it may not even have been one-man, one-woman. 

I think you may actually be subject to another selection bias of your own: most marriages weren't recorded until, IIRC, around the 16th to 19th century, depending on the region. In medieval Europe, what we today would call "shacking up" was the very definition of marriage - you were married when one partner moved in with the other, and maybe your family or the church held festivities for the occasion. 

Incidentally, one way to validate this is to look at international comparisons today. Today's developing countries may have their own issues, but in many ways, especially when it comes to the basics of humanity, very much resemble medieval Europe. 

The main historical cultural boundary within Germany has been for centuries between the parts that used to be occupied by the Romans, and the parts that weren't. Which roughly translates to a North/South boundary, rather than East/West. BTW, in this context, Austria should be considered part of Germany's south; it is a separate country only due to a historic accident. This boundary was frequently reinforced by wars, and the resulting enmities, such as the war between Prussia and Bavaria that still kindles resentments between these two regions. That division is still reflected in many parts of the culture. For instance, all the major wine-growing regions are in formerly Roman-occupied territories (of course, climate also plays a role here). Germans have the term "Weisswurstequator" - a (supposed) line, south of which people eat Weisswurst (white sausage). Generally, food, dialects, traditions, religion and a lot of other aspects of life were shaped by this divide. The East/West divide really only affected the northern German cultural area to begin with, and in a surprisingly short time did create a new cultural divide that, as far as I can tell, seems to persist (although I don't live there any more). Finally, the question about why the West prospered and the East impoverished. To some extent, some of the underlying assumptions may not be true. Of course the West ended up wealthier than the East, but East Germany was actually fairly economically successful in its own right; it was said to be the wealthiest of the Soviet Bloc countries. And the West wasn't uniformly wealthy, either - most of the economic success was concentrated in the South, while northern West Germany was comparatively poor (not poor in absolute terms, of course, just relative to the south) Another big factor that makes this an apples/oranges comparison is the Marshall Plan, and generally the fact that the West was embedded in a very prosperous North-Atlantic alliance, while the East was trapped in a failing alliance. And, yes, of course the different economic systems did make a difference, too. 

It wasn't up to the East German government to decide any more. Contrary to popular perception, it also was widely controversial within both the East and West German populations. I lived in Berlin at the time and saw it first-hand. The West Germans were concerned about the cost, and the East Germans were concerned about losing their identity, although they also hoped for a much improved economy. The clause in the West German Grundgesetz that ostensibly mandated reunification could have been changed as circumstances changed. The real reason for reunification was simple power politics: Helmut Kohl was deeply unpopular at the time and on the verge of losing the next election. He needed access to a new loyal voter pool. 

The purpose of marriage has changed multiple times. Marriage could be for love. Marriage could be for political reasons (not just in the higher levels, but potentially even at the village level). Marriage could be for procreation. Marriage could be for social security. Marriage could be for mutual protection. Marriage could be for division of labor. Different purposes would lead to different optimum marriage ages. 

Others have already provided excellent information and cites. There are a couple other things to look at. There may actually be a proxy that you can use to fill in data that you can't directly obtain: the number of children a woman bears should be related to her marriage age. The larger the family size, the younger the marriage age. Another proxy might be the length of one generation (which would indicate the average age of the mother when having any of her children). Finally, a proxy you could use is when property (farms etc.) was passed through the generation. In many regions, they were passed on only from father to the firstborn son, which would give you a good indication of the age of the father when he had his first child, and thus indirectly of the marriage age of men (of course, daughters as first children would be a confounding factor here!) In central Europe, you also will have a hard time going back 1000 years with your research, because the 30 years war (1609-1639) destroyed most relevant records, if they were even ever collected.
