Reference: My personal script Run it and see if any objects are displayed containing your obsolete filegroup. Go with the rather than with the name. The joins are intentionally to catch any "orphaned" references. Alternatively use this smaller script to quick check for items in the obsolete filegroup: 

It's nice to know that SQL Server has everything nice and tied up, but what does that share actually do? Is it the so called "file system filter driver"? Seeing as any authenticated user can access the "share", what are the security implications? Is the Device RsFx0320 a predecessor to the resilient file system format that was introduced with Windows Server 2012? 

You are looking at the data cache usage. But there are more objects in memory than just the data. sys.dm_exec_cached_plans You have to consider the plan cache (sys.dm_exec_cached_plans (Transact-SQL)) and other objects. 

Removing Maintenance Plans This can reduce the need for the TLog file to grow because INDEX REORGANIZE and INDEX REBUILD are no longer performed. But, ... Adding Ola Solution ... adding the Index Optimisation Jobs from Ola will perform Index maintenance too. So you've just replaced Index Maintenance with Index Maintenance. No real gains. Ok, So What Do You Have to Do Now? 

Depending on your requirements and/or the size of the data, you might have to reorganise some indexes earlier. Very simple example You have a table with 200 Million records (online archive) and 10'000 records are modified on a daily basis and 10'000 records are created daily. Doing the simple maths results in a maximum fragmentation of 0.01% which will never trigger the index reorg or rebuild. It would take 500 days to reach 5% fragmentation. In a production environment this could lead to potential performance issues, depending on the size of the table involved and the complexity of the queries. Your question answered Yes, you are good for fragmentation, with the above limitations. 

And then carry on from there. Reference: Identifying Object Name for CREATE and ALTER Using fn_dblog() 

This is just a small starting point and should give you a general idea on how to keep things out of the master database. And always ensure you are on your database when running scripts to create objects: 

Full-Text Catalog Indexing takes time. The official Microsoft Document states (emphasis by me) in the section Population based on change tracking: 

Open SSMS with your personal account. Open up a connection to your SQL Server instance with Windows Authentication.

You have now loaded the SQL Powershell Module and have been switched to the SQLSERVER drive. Let's see what we can retrieve from the system: 

Check the SQL Server ERRORLOG file for login issues and track down who is behind the IP address in the error message. 

Change the password for the sa account to ensure nobody gains access to the server via this account. Ensure that the option Failed logins only is enabled at server level in the in the Server properties - xyz | Security tab | Login auditing section . (Better: If you have enough space for your ERRORLOG and are cycling the ERRORLOG at a regular interval, set it to Both failed and successful logins.)

You could always script out the relevant tables and/or indexes by using the following statements.

You can't connect from a 9.2.0 SQL*Plus to a 12.2.0.1 version or Oracle Database. It was never a supported option as displayed in the Interoperability Support Situation matrix chart in an Oracle Support Note.1 (Oracle Support Login required to read the Oracle Document.) A SQL*Plus 9.2.0 client was only able to connect to 11.2.0 server or lower. The lowest supported version of SQL*Plus that could connect to an 12.2.0.1 version of Oracle Database would be an 11.2.0.x client. 1 Oracle: Note 207303.1 Reference: oracle 9i client connecting to oracle 12c server (Stackoverflow.com)

I think this article is the nearest you will come to determining what goes on under the hoods: Where Does SQL Server Store the Source for Stored Procedures? (improve.dk) In his article Mark S. Rasmussen digs into finding out where several (SQL Server) internal views retrieve base definitions from. Mark achieves this by analysing a self created procedure .

The name is the name of the share you provide when initially configuring FILESTREAM in the SQL Server Configuration Manager. But what is it for? So far I read through all the available FILESTREAM documentation starting at: 

When the login is complete you have verified the authenticity of your account (USER_n) against either the computer (COMPUTER_1) or against the Active Directory domain (DOMAIN_1). Environment Now let's say we have the following information based on your questions: 

The database owner displayed in the files section of the database properties is not displayed in the Security branch of the database. This is by design. Explanation Database Owner The database owner in the file setting of the database properties is the owner of the database and does not have to be explicitly listed in the security tab. This is normally the SQL Login that created the database. 

Now you could carry on and define your table data as assets and a general risk as a security risk, because your assets contains sensitive data, which leaves you with: 

Solution Nr. 2 As pointed out by @RamakantDadhichi, changing the filename to be unique by adding the date and time can help prevent multiple backups in one file. 

Reference: Database-Level Roles (Microsoft Docs) These are similar to the database owner in that they have the same permissions, but are explicitly defined in the database. That is why they are displayed in the security branch of the database. Solution To change the database owner ... Assign new database owner To remove a Database Owner (not the role) you have to assign a new database owner. This can be achieved using the mentioned stored procedure (deprecated) or the syntax. Reference: ALTER AUTHORIZATION (Transact-SQL) (Microsoft Docs) 

Then restart your server and change the password as you normally would. Mixed Mode (SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode) If you don't turn on Mixed Mode authentication you will constantly receive an error message when trying to log in with the SQL Server login even though you have changed the password and enabled the login. 

... the user using the sa account is unable to enter the correct password after n attempts, which results in a lock out. ... the hacker is unable to gain access again, which results in a lockout. ... somebody is just having fun locking out the sa account. 

You can't bypass the built-in limitation of an Access database. You can however circumvent the built-in limitation by using built-in features like splitting the database objects between multiple files and referencing them accordingly. The Access 2016 Specifications state: 

a. replace with the name of the database b. replace with a Windows Account (e.g. ) or a SQL Login (e.g. ). 

I'm trying to figure out various things surrounding PostgreSQL and how backups should work together with WAL and Commvault Simpana. Simpana is telling me that everything is ok, but leaves files lying around in the WAL Archive directory. Let the journey begin. Environment PostgreSQL & OS Version PostgreSQL 9.3 is running on an Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS server. Postgres WAL Config The postgres.conf file is set as follows for WAL archiving. 

When you create a user in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) with the graphical user interface, you are initially creating the SQL Server Login (Windows authentication or SQL Server authentication). Differences at this stage are: 

The disk and/or disk controller is set to use a WRITE CACHE mechanism which is unable to keep up with the import of large amounts of data. The corruption is occurring on flushing. 

Simpana will create a large snapshot, because all the blocks have changed since the last snapshot. Even if you had a large TLog with lots of space, you would still see a jump in the snapshot size if you have large amounts of data that are modified. 

Explanation The SQL Server Windows Authenticated Login is linked to the database user , which has now been granted the database role and . When logs in to the SQL Server instance and connects to his database, he has the rights/permissions assigned to the database user . 

As you can see the newer Service Pack 3 limits the support of the previous Service Pack 2 to approx. 1 year after the newer Service Pack was introduced. This is normally what happens with each newer Service Pack. Microsoft gives you a grace period of a year to upgrade to the newer Service Pack. So you can expect (no guarantees from Microsoft) that the support for the older Service Pack 3 will expire one year after the introduction of Service Pack 4 (which would be June 2018). 

If you already have objects that require public to the table then you can add the following for each existing table: 

I'm looking forward to your responses and hope that somebody has a similar configuration of Simpana and PostgreSQL somewhere out there. 

Possibly the developer is using a 3rd-party tool that provides a plug-in for SQL Server Management Studio. The 3rd party plug-in is started with SQL Server Management Studio and is trying to connect to the SQL Server using the credentials the process was initially started with. If the initial process owner of the 3rd-party tool is running with an un-privileged account that does not have access to he SQL Server instance the developer is connecting to, then you will possibly see multiple error messages in the file and in the Windows Event Log on the target server (see Link below for examples). If the initial process owner of the 3rd-party tool is not allowed to delegate permissions on its own object, then you might see the SSPI Handshake error. There is a Microsoft Blog article titled Common ‘SSPI handshake failed’ errors and troubleshooting which provides you with some ideas on how to find the main cause. Most of the SSPI Handshake erros are because a process can not handover/delegate the permissions during the SSPI Handshake to another user/process. 

Ola Hallengren's solution is based on beset practice and years of experience. There are some quirks though. Take a look.... Before you start Before you run the initial script, check the first few parameters and the database used: 

Cigar Lounge The following query will list all cached plans stored in the QPC, and can be linked to other relevant DMVs to retrieve additional information: 

So the new CE just compares the two tables and determines that the row count of the table is 776286 (which is the number in the whitepaper) and is larger than the row count of 60398 for the table and uses the larger of the two numbers for the CE. In your case with the 1M table and the 22M table the new CE would use your large 22M rows table and depending on your statement this might result in a huge overestimation and result in sub-optimal performance. You might be better off turning the new CE off again. But as I said: That depends on your statements.

If this doesn't reconfigure the database control for your instance you might have to re-create the repository containing all the Entrprise Management Console configuration settings. You would achieve this be adding a parameter to the previous command:
