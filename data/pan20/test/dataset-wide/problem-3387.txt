This is a grammatical sentence, but if you found it on a note in a bottle in the middle of the Pacific Ocean it would be a little hard to understand properly. 

Most languages I know have something like NPIs, though there is less use for at least some of them in languages like French or Yiddish that use Negative Concord. The bibliography in this article may help, especially van der Wouden 1996, Horn and Kato 2000, and Zeijlstra, Hedde, and Soehn 2007. 

These labiovelar consonants wound up in Greek smeared all across the mouth as labials, dentals, or velars. Occasionally, as with the reflexes of *kʷel- 'wheel', one can find all three: 

But the fact is that descriptive statements are by far less common in real language than are isolated words or phrases, fragments of idioms and conversational formulae, and simple sub-morphemic intonation contours (i.e, grunts, including the various versions of "Oh", "Ah", "Eh?). Mostly people talk in phrases, not clauses. Sentence-level and paragraph-level consistency in structure and focus is the exception, not the rule -- at least for those educated in Anglophone schools, where such consistency is famously uncultivated. So the evolutionary reasons for preferring descriptive statements in some contexts are probably still the reasons for using them in those contexts. AFTERTHOUGHT: 

Yes, there are, and you used three of them in your question. They're called Complementizers, and they serve to introduce various kinds of subordinate clauses. Almost all of these clauses represent propositions, hence are abstract noun phrases. Note that this is English grammar, not logical notation. If you want formalization, you need look no further than composition of functions. Your third sentence is a straightforward , but the first two together are . I.e, there's a hidden variable (and a function producing it) that's involved in choosing , given only and . It's always possible to posit a hidden property; otherwise metaphors would be impossible. As for your specific formulations, obviously there are special meanings attached to terms like individual, universal, mark, bear, and instance, so I can't say anything about them. I'm curious about whether bearing the mark refers to an actual identifiable mark, or merely a nonterminal node in a decision tree. 

That's what they really mean, I think. There's quite a lot more one could say on the topic, but I forbear. 

In fact, English has more "words for snow" than any Eskimo language has. Any speech group will differentiate terms for whatever categories they find useful. But "the number of words for in a language" is no measure of anything at all; it's just mythology in action. As far as Eskimo words for snow are concerned, there's a famous book by Geoff Pullum entitled The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language. The title essay is available online, courtesy of the author. In it you will see that every time you read a remark about how many Eskimo words there are for snow, you are dealing with an author who is clueless about both Eskimo and language, and who is willing to make up facts as they go along for the purpose of using a familiar old saw. 

Infinitive can refer to the infinitive form of the verb, e.g, be, run, go, see, feel, have, admit, ask Every verb in English (except defective verbs like born and modal auxiliaries) has 

Greek was heavily inflected, and many of the suffixes began with /s/. Many of the roots ended in stop consonants, right before adding suffixes. Before /s/, the three-way voiced/voiceless/aspirated stop distinction neutralized; i.e, there was no difference and they all came out the same. 

The which is simply an alternate construction of the relative pronoun which (probably only introducing nonrestrictive relative clauses). 

Since you seem very literal in your interpretations, I add that when I say something is "1-D", I don't mean that it lacks the other two dimensions, but rather that it has only one salient dimension. Trees are 1-D, walls are 2-D, and stumps are 3-D because they have (respectively) 1, 2, or 3 salient dimensions. 

can be said even to have a head, and if so, it's clearly not headed by a noun. It's simply an NP, since it corresponds to an argument of the predicate adjective unfortunate. The constituent containing determiners that precedes prenominal adjectives is then simply, in X-Bar terminology, a . In general, an will contain a . For instance, the subject of the following sentence 

For the record, I agree with both of them, and appreciate their responses. And I'd add that fieldwork is not cheap, and one normally spends at least as much time and effort on getting the wherewithal for it as one does in expending it gainfully. Don't become a fieldworker if you don't want to beg for funding, unless you're independently wealthy. 

A phonetician can probably give a better explanation, but I used to worry about this, too, and the conclusion I came to was that when you analyze any language, there's always a few consonants that crowd the borderline with vowels, and form lots of consonant clusters, and weird vowel diphthongs, and they always turn out to be sonorants and laterals like [r ʀ ɾ ɹ l ɭ ɫ], etc. There may be only one phoneme in a given language, like Mandarin or Japanese, that shares these allophones and patterning; or there may be as many as 4 or more (usually 2 lateral, 2 retroflex/2 palatal, 2 velarized, or some such). But there are always some. The ones in one language might count as normal stops in some other language, but in the one they're sonorants and pattern the same as sonorants in any other language, mutatis mutandis. 

There is no such thing as a "correctly-formed neologism". Neologisms are, by definition, new, and therefore not provided for in The Rules. So they're by definition also "incorrect". Of course, The Rules can change, and that's what happens when a neologism survives. The Rules come to accept it (or at least they ignore it). As to "knowlet", there is a fundamental problem, caused, as usual, by English spelling. The root know occurs with two pronunciations, though the spelling doesn't change: 

Dislocated constructions, like most constructions that indicate speaker attitude by intonation, are features of speech rather than writing. Oh, and dislocation is not a feature of British English. It's all over the US, for instance. 

This allows the form and the meaning of passive sentences to be described, simply, by means of reference to the corresponding active sentence. And, by unwinding, to produce a corresponding active from a passive. This cuts the number of sentences that have to be described way down, because now Passives can be completely specified by reference to the prototype Active. And every time you discover another rule, you simplify the prototype that much more. That's the rationale, basically. Surely any scientific theory of grammar should be able to describe such a simple correlation between simple sentences in a simple way. This is one such way. If you've got a neater way, tell us about it. And Passive is just one rule of several hundred in English, and this way works for all of them. As for the tag in the question ... 

Church Latin and Classical Latin were quite different phonologically. Classical Latin was syllable-timed and had vowel length and predictable stress; Church (i.e, Medieval) Latin was stress-timed and had lost vowel length and stress was (therefore) unpredictable. My guess is that if a fluent speaker of one and a fluent speaker of the other had to discuss something they both knew about, they would each think the other's accent barbarous, but they would eventually be able to understand one another. The issue is native speakers; there were many fluent speakers of one dialect or another of Medieval Latin over its 1500 or so years, but no native speakers born in a speech community. For the first 15 centuries of the Christian Era, anyone in Europe who read or wrote anything -- with very few exceptions -- read and wrote in Latin, whatever language they spoke natively. Thus, all fluent Latin speakers were literate, having learned the language in order to be able to read and write. This constituted a very small (but very important) proportion of the population. However, this is the case for Classical Latin as well. By the time of J. Caesar, the language spoken in the streets of Rome was not the same as Classical Latin, since it was Vulgar Latin -- a quite different language, and busy turning into all the Romance languages (Modern Italian is basically the Tuscan dialect of Vulgar Latin with two millennia of age on it). The first thing that happened was a lot of sound changes, leading to a total restructuring of the grammar -- no cases and only two genders, for instance. So the fluent speakers of Classical Latin from early Imperial times were not native speakers of it, either. Diglossia was a prominent feature of European language communities, and still is in many places. So, since the language was identical when written for 1500 years and could be spoken by many at any time (it was necessary for any serious work), though the pronunciations and word meanings changed, as necessary, when the cultures did. I'd say they were the same language, as much the same as Mexican Spanish and Peninsular Spanish, say. 

(SAY (BART,           (INTEND (BART,                             (TODAY (BRAID (BART, LISA_HAIR)))))                                                       LISA))           ∧ (YESTERDAY (CHOP_OFF (BART, BART_HAND))) Using the convention of Source, Trajector, and Goal, in that order, for 3-place SAY puts LISA at the end. That doesn't matter for predicate calculus, since dative is syntax, not semantics. Also tense doesn't matter, so SAY is fine, and I've represented Lisa's hair and Bart's hand as single objects so as to avoid unnecessary lambdafication. Note that there is nothing contradictory here; the implications of Bart's missing hand yesterday and its results on his braiding Lisa's hair today are not part of the logic, but rather the contextual interpretation. It's signalled by the but in the sentence, but it has no place in the logic; that's why but = and in logic. 

Both...And, Either...Or, and Neither...Nor are the classic examples of correlative conjunctions. Either is a disjunctive dual form in English, parallel with both, a conjunctive dual form, in some uses: 

the reason why Bill said the sentence "John was fired" (say, Bill wanted me to know), or the reason why John was fired (say, John lit a firecracker under Bill's desk). 

A somewhat more useful way is to do what snailboat suggests above, namely ignore the Hypothesis, which is after all just a hypothesis that can't be disproved, and go for something that represents the data rather than the theory. For instance, McCawley 1998 distinguishes between two types of nouny constituent in English: 

Sure. Lushootseed has two different object pronoun paradigms, depending on whether the action predicated was performed volitionally or not. For example: 

is not a sentence; it's a noun phrase. As Tom Robbins once put it, This sentence no verb. If it occurs in a corpus, its context will tell you what's been deleted, if anything. Second, the basic rule for clauses is that every non-auxiliary verb defines a clause. Thus, if there are two verbs in an utterance, as here, there are two clauses. (Neither one is a main clause, because this utterance is not a sentence.) The bracketing would be something like   [np     [np the kind of woman np]       [s [np that/who np] [vp makes [np         [s [np people np] [vp remember [np Marilyn Monroe np] vp] s]                                                       np]                                     vp]           s]     np] 

That's in terms of syntax, mind you, not morphology. But to the extent one considers morphology as a sort of phonological syntax, the same principles apply, provided one can distinguish and mark exceptions. Much of it is quite simple, even in a complex morphology. Some of it is harder; and agreement phenomena slide right over into syntax again. Finally, I've been informed by Jerry Sadock, an expert on West Greenlandic Eskimo languages, that polysynthetic Eskimo has recursive morphology; it works very simply through noun incorporation, since complement clauses are nouns. So one can theoretically make recursive words of countably infinite length, though performance constraints appear to make these rare. 

Phonological ambiguity is often the result of phonological change. Feet and feat are homonyms in Modern English, but they were pronounced differently in Middle English. The Great Vowel Shift merged both ME long /æ:/ and long /e:/ into Modern English tense /i/, whence /fit/. So another example of phonological change that changes the syntactic structure -- in fact a recurring prototypical example -- is the Grammaticalization Cycle. This happened in Latin around 0 CE, leading to the Romance languages; and in English a millennium later, after the Norman invasion make English a language spoken by illiterate peasants. 

Beside the tense/lax phonetic distinction (which refers to the muscles at the root of the tongue), these phonemes are distinguished in several other ways -- language loves redundancy and builds it into the structure whenever possible. For instance, all the tense vowel phonemes are diphthongized, whereas the lax vowels are pure vowels, which may be neutralized with their tense counterpart in some environments (Mary, merry, marry), but never appear with an offglide except in local variants. In the high front vowels /i, u/ the diphthongization isn't always distinctive because the tongue gesture is so short, but it's there and shows up in transitional /y/s and /w/s in phrases like be able or do it. It's clearer in the mid vowels, where the distance the tongue has to move going from [e] to [i] or [o] to [u] is longer and more easily distinguished. Indeed, pronunciation of Spanish /e/ as /ei/ and /o/ as /ou/ is one of the characteristics of an English accent. English speakers are normally unable to distinguish the two in Spanish, just as Spanish speakers are normally unable to distinguish English tense vowels from lax, leading to ship sheep late let Paul pole foot boot vocabulary problems. There are complexities. In RP, as noted, the actual diphthong is centralized to [əʊ], and the Northern Cities Chain Shift has screwed up urban American English vowels almost as thoroughly as what the Great Vowel Shift did to Middle English vowels. 

The rule of Wh-Question Formation is not a cyclic rule, limited in its effects to constituents in the neighborhood of a single clause, and therefore Wh-Question Formation can move a wh-word from anywhere in the question to the beginning. In this case, it has a choice of moving one from the main clause or one from a subordinate clause. 

There are a number of what are called "small verbs" in English, which are used in many idioms and constructions, often with special syntactic provisions. These verbs include keep, make, like, want, do, give, take, go, come, and have, among others. And this is one (probably at least two, as the possibility of infinitive to be shows) of those construction types. This type of idiomatic small verb construction occurs with the verbs keep, make, want, and like. 

I think you'll find that it's initial dental stops that "soften" before /r/ ("soft" and "hard" are not phonetic terms, alas). Treat is an example, while street isn't, at least not so much. What's going on in treat is technically called Affrication, i.e, the initial, voiceless, aspirated /t/ and the following voiceless retroflex /r/ are joining together as an affricate, just like /tʃ/ in cheat. And why does treat sound so much like cheat? The key is the fact that initial voiceless stops in English /p t tʃ k/ are aspirated. This means they get a little puff of air when they're pronounced. This is quite automatic but very easy to perceive, and the aspiration merges with the /r/, which is already voiceless because it's following a voiceless stop, and the result does sound very much like /tʃ/. It's possible to distinguish them, but we often can choose which one to "hear", in context. Note that English doesn't use /r/ after /tʃ/ or /dʒ/, though it occurs after all other stops; try pronouncing "chree" so that it doesn't sound like "tree", and you'll see. The palatal affricates behave otherwise like normal stop consonants; this restriction on /r/ clusters is because palatals are too close to /r/ in the mouth for us to distinguish easily. This is a common situation in many languages. In Mandarin, for instance, which has contrastive Palatal and Retroflex stop series (in Pinyin, palatal stops are all single letters j, q, and x, while retroflex stops are two-letter combinations with a second letter h), hearing and pronouncing the distinctions between them is always a challenge for English speakers. In English, however, we only have the one retroflex consonant /r/ (which you can represent as /ɹ/ if you feel it's required), and /r/ is unique phonetically, and famously variable in different English dialects as well. 

Grammar is a (occasionally the) set of rules for the organization of meaningful elements into sentences; their economy, in one sense of that word. There are two basic varieties of grammar; all languages have some of both kinds, but, depending on the kind of language involved, there's a lot of variation in how much of each kind they have.
