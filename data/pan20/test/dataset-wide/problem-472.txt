There are several companies that make covers for trailer hitched bikes. It's essentially a giant bag that's designed to cinch down over your bikes and rack. For a long trip like you are suggesting, it's probably well worth getting one. I have seen bikes after such road trips on a rear rack coated in horrible, horrible road slime. 

TL;DR Technique is a lot like bikes. There is rarely something appropriate for every situation and it's important to understand where advice or input is coming from. Advice from a pro road rider may be great for road racing, but it isn't going to necessarily translate if you are riding BMX. Circumstances and situation are everything. There are a multitude of factors that go into this, so I am not going to suppose there is a completely correct answer. To start with different riders will have varying levels of arm strength, so the ability to resist forward forces will vary accordingly. A pro Slope Style rider with a better developed upper body (from hours spent shoveling dirt and throwing a "heavy" bike around) maybe able to resist far more force than a pro road rider whose arms are purposely underdeveloped to maintain a favorable power to weight ratio. Beyond the fact that the individual rider differences, there are large differences brought on by the braking situation. Braking suddenly on a road bike (with road geometry) on dry pavement has a vastly different set of circumstances than braking on loose wet mud on a steep downhill on a full downhill race rig. The amount of traction available will dictate how quickly one can bleed speed. In favorable conditions, the braking period may be relatively short and resisting those forces briefly with just upper body strength may be a good option. In poor conditions, some slide may be assumed, some balance may be required, and an extended period of force resistance may dictate different technique. You may be able to press your body weight for 2 seconds or less to come to a complete stop, but can you do it for 6 seconds while sliding down a rock garden and maintain your balance? Other factors include instinctual development of skills for braking (muscle memory). I ride a few different styles (some road, downhill in the past, lots of winter snow riding and some mountain as well) and almost all of those styles require different technique. I can't remeber ever trying to get behind the seat on my road bike. The geometry doesn't really support it and it just isn't necessary during any normal riding situation. I have had times on a downhill rig sliding down a long gravel hill where the rear wheel is spinning against my shorts and I was damn glad because I hoped it would slow me down just a bit more. I've had times on my snow bike that I couldn't get behind the seat on an icy downhill because I had an expedition seat bag and ended up laying the bike down instead because I didn't think I could maintain control without getting my weight farther back. In some situations, it is actually better to lock your rear wheel and enter a controlled slide and leave your front brake largely untouched. Sheldon has those situations deliniated here at the bottom. Keep in mind that while those may seem seldom to some, riding in ice and snow or on mud in the rain can mean that "slippery surfaces" are the norm. 

You can tell when you are knackered. Power indicates your actual output. With a baseline of previous power and HR data, you can establish a model for what you should be able to do. When your numbers start to fall way outside your model/baseline (you normally produce 250W at 80% of your max heartrate, but now you are only producing 200W at 85% or 90% of your max heart rate) it might be time to do something about it (check hydration, calories or just end training for the day). Additionally in off training times your resting heart rate can be looked at as an indicator for how well recovered you are. Power output is a finite number that is extremely useful because comparisons can be made directly across riders. However, your own stats bio metrics are more useful to you as an individual because they can help guide your training and prevent you from overtraining, help show your individual improvement, and let you know when you are recovered and can accept an increased training load. 

I think this question is similar to what can I do to my road bike so it handles rock gardens better. The real answer here is disc brakes. This problem is extremely common here in both the fall and spring. I personally found that the far worse situation was the ABS effect that happened when you grabbed the brakes hard and had only sections of the rim that were clear. You end up with stutter braking that makes the bike very difficult to control (especially when it's unexpected). I strongly recommend disc brakes to anyone cycling in below freezing conditions. Rim brakes have all the problems you mentioned above beyond often being less effective as the rubber hardens at colder temperatures. Many people will tell you that disc brakes are unnecessary for non-technical riding. While its true that the stopping power generated by rim brakes under optimal conditions is fine, inclement weather can quickly make rim brakes perform sub optimally (or worse). Disc brakes tend to be far less effected by these swings. I spent my first several months suffering through winter commuting with rim brakes. Eventually I bought a set of disc brakes and a wheel set that together cost more that the entry level bike I put them on. I never recommend a bike with rim brakes to anyone that is thinking about winter commuting here in interior Alaska. 

I would also look into the headlamp idea. The main disadvantage to a headlamp is riding with one while snowing. The rest of the time they work as well or better than most bike mounted lights and require no extra effort when you leave your bike. I actually wear my red blinky (as well as sometimes a total of three) attached to the headband of my headlamp and call it my "crown of dorkdom". It looks dumb, but it can't be missed. It also means I don't have to mess around with my blinkies in the cold. When it gets really cold, plastic gets brittle, and dealing with cold plastic as little as possible is the best way to extend it's life. 

You likely won't find anything conclusive, because the required testing would be so varied. Anything done poorly can cause problems. Any sport lends itself to an increased chance for injury. However, proper technique and equipment generally alleviates some, if not most of that risk. In cycling, proper hygiene, attire, technique and bike fit are all important. Keeping your skin clean (before and after rides). During rides (especially longer rides) chamois cream of some sort can help immensely. Bike shorts are made for a reason: they work. They should also be clean, however. Other attire is also important. Overdressing and sweating yourself out only creates a breeding ground for bacteria. Remember body odor varies from person to person, but is largely caused by the flora on the skin. No reason to build it a Disneyland unnecessarily. A properly fitting seat and bike will minimize friction and irritation. These factors can cause surface skin damage which then leads to infection (saddle sores, etc) after the skin begins to break down. If you are referring to bladder infections, I think it would be a long road with a lot of ignorance to get there. While females are generally more prone to UTIs, and cycling could increase the risk of those, the steps necessary to reduce the risk are quite easy and really part of basic hygiene. Getting a UTI and then ignoring it long enough for it to hit the bladder would require an additional step of disregard. 

Protection level is a personal preference matter. You could just as well wear downhill style full body armor to commute and if you are willing to sacrifice the mobility and comfort for that extra level of protection, I'd say more power to you. So my answer is you should wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable mentally. The reality is it's all shades of grey. If a one ton pickup hits you going 55 mph, there really isn't much you could be wearing that is going to do you any good. I've been hit twice now commuting, but have stopped wearing any sort of helmet in the winter due to temperature control issues. I value ease of temperature adjustment more than any feeling of safety I get from a helmet. So much of cycling is personal preference that I have seen several folks in town wearing full face helmets on what is seemingly a commute, and it doesn't bother me any more or less than the brand of bicycle they are riding. Edit: I do not recommend wearing any less than the level of protection required by law in your area. My jurisdiction has no such requirements. 

In your case, I would purchase based on reviews (for durability) and feel. Merino have the advantage of tending to stink less. However, if you are riding only once a week (not sounding like a commute) it's less of an issue for you. Some people will likely argue that one or the other lasts longer, but the reality is that manufacturing techniques vary so widely that you can find good examples of either extreme in both makes. Wool generally requires a bit more attention with care (not drying on high). My sock collection is about 95% wool. I used to lean towards coolmax (or other synthetics), but wool socks now feel so nice to me that I can't see a reason to go back. The only synthetic socks I regularly use now are my vapor barriers, which almost always get a wool over the top. 

My personal opinion was that for short commuting (30 minutes or less of cycling) I prefer a backpack. It's less to deal with and a short enough time that the extra weight on my hands didn't matter to me. For longer rides I would not wear a backpack because the extra weight becomes noticeable. Road bikes tend to have "longer" geometry and stretch you out. This means you are holding your head up at a higher angle. I would test your setup out before I committed to a road bicycle/helmet/backpack combo. Many of the backpacks I have tried come up high enough that if you lean far enough forward, you can't actually raise your head all the way up with a helmet on, which isn't safe. 

Not to say this isn't a decent method to try for a home mechanic as an initial troubleshooting step if you are into it. It may be done faster, with little to no cost, and may help some issues. However, you are correct, it does have several shortcomings. 

With a disc brake, it depends on your clearance. I buckled a front wheel once on a pump track that was so bad it couldn't spin because the worst section rubbed against the fork stanchions. On a rim brake, if the bend is any more than the gap on your brakes, it will also rub. So, depending on the clearance you have on your fork or frame, there may not be a difference at all in how disabling it is. Any bike has X amount of clearance and if the bend in the rim is any more than that clearance, your wheels won't roll. 

I recommend removing the disc rotors when you travel with a bike regardless of the packaging method. I have a hard sided case and have done the cardboard box thing (my fat bike does not fit in my hard sided case). Hard sided cases rely on compression to keep everything in place; compression against the flat side of a rotor is not a good thing. Remove the rotors and pack them on each side of a piece of rigid material that will reinforce them and tape the whole thing up. They can be easily put back on with the proper Torx wrench. If this seems like overkill, keep in mind TSA WILL unpack your bike. Do not bother closing a cardboard box before getting to the airport, because they will just cut it open. I leave the box open and leave a roll of tape on top for them to seal it with. I pack any loose items in the box with the understanding that they will be removed and likely reinserted in a different spot inside the box/case. That being the case, you want loose items padded or enclosed in something for when they end up someplace you didn't intend them. I usually make sure to take all the same tools I used to disassemble the bike and pack them as well (usually in a separate padded bag) in the same box/container. I have always favored the center lock rotors because they were easier on and off for travel. 

All of my winter rides are tubeless now. I have successfully used tubeless setups with Stan's at -40F. Many other riders in my area have used them extensively and without issue at temperatures well below zero. Stan's happens to be the fluid used by my LBS, but I am sure there are others that work as well. The hard part is getting the initial seal to work properly on fat tires. If they don't fail on the initial ride, they are just as reliable as in warmer temperatures. 

Training wheels serve a very specific purpose on a child's bike. They are designed to keep a child upright and prevent them from tipping. However, they are also designed to ride off the ground when the bike is upright and to be slowly raised as the child's skill level improves until they are no longer needed. If you expect to regain strength and function (this is something you and your doctor should be able to discuss), then training wheels may be appropriate as they will function in a similar manner as they do a child while you recover. If such a recovery is not possible or is a very long term goal, you would likely be better served with a trike which is more stable and designed to be ridden on multiple wheels.
