Wine has no vitamin C at all, so the answer would be: definitely no. But there's a twist. To expand on @LarsBosteen's comment: the wiki page on Posca and romae-vitam.com claim that Posca, rather than wine, actually may have been the antiscorbutic the larger population relied on. It's basically a mix of wine vinegar, water, and additives thrown in for flavor (Romans, as an aside, thought of drinking wine pure as vulgar). That is a lot more plausible - especially given the recipe suggestion on romae-vitam.com: 

The German rail network in 1861 suggests there already was a track nearby (you can see a track between Eisenach and Bamberg if you zoom in) so the travel time would likely have been within 10 days in 1862 as well: 

They had the technology to navigate outside of the Mediterranean, or at the very least their Phoenician neighbors did: 

For the same reason the US entered the war against the UK in 1812 and WW1 against Germany: Because their (merchant) ships were getting sunk. In this case, by the Nazis. In each case, their ships were getting sunk for "good reasons". In 1812 the US was doing business with the French. In WW1 and WW2, the US was doing business with the allies. 

The coat-of-arms is that of the Austrian state of Lower Austria; another source says that "the arms were officially granted in 1920" (the mural crown is usually employed by republics to replace monarchic crowns), placing it sometime between that date and 1938. EDIT: Here's someone selling that same badge and dating it as "Second Austrian Republic", that is, anytime since 1945. 

So it was the first time both capitals and minuscules were used in a standard way (instead of ocassionally as with previous minuscule scripts). I don't think it would be possible to pinpoint exactly which was the first text ever to use them together, though. 

From what I gathered, without knowing which book it was you were reading, both towns appear to have been two mining centers, established by the mining company El Boleo, and they must have just taken their names from existing landmarks (mountains or streams – there's a Purgatorio stream near Santa Rosalía, in the center of that mining area). In any case, looks like it was nothing strange for the Spaniards to name places like that, for, from what I have seen, there's at least one Purgatorio stream in Sonora, another one in Jalisco and, much farther away, one in Colombia. The Purgatoire river, being in Colorado, it's my guess that it was so named by the Spaniards and got its name anglicised (Protestants don't believe in Purgatory and it would be odd for them to name anything after it). Providence, Rhode Island, was named, as also was every Spanish town of that name, after the Divine Providence by its founders, deeply religious people, so in that case it was just coincidence. 

Slightly massaged version of the data located by Sempaiscuba in this Google Sheet. There were a few errors in the data. I used it to produce this chart of US Congress days in session per year: 

In the original sense of the term, Roman Dictators were magistrates of the Roman Republic, entrusted with the full authority of the state to deal with a military emergency or to undertake a specific duty for up to 6 months. A few state heads used the title formally in the 19th century, before it got its negative connotation, and sometimes called their government a dictatorship or some variation of the term. For instance: 

She wasn't technically knighted insofar as I'm aware of, but Joan of Arc springs to mind. She played a decisive role in ending the Hundred Years' War. Cursory googling yields a few more female warriors here, but only Joan of Arc is from the European middle ages, and this Quora question on the same topic with a few more examples. One of the Quora answers incidentally references the Order of the Hatchet as female knights: 

Interestingly, the French Wikipedia article about perrons says that originally the letters were added to distinguish the coat-of-arms of Liège from that of Saint-Trond, which also featured the perron and the letters S and T, and that in the Middle Ages, the coat-of-arms carried the syllables Lie and Ge or Ly and Ge (which seem demonstrated by the picture in Thomo's answer); it also goes on to add, that the "Libertas Gentis" meaning is a recent legend the people from Liège are fond of — they very probably are, since that's what the Liège website says! Further confirmation is provided by a website (in French) that cites a text by Liègian historian Théodore Gobert: 

Marcellus is still not identified, and his work is lost. According to a footnote in a 2006 Cambridge edition of Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Timaeus, 

EDIT- I'm adding extra information: The "Grand Turk" was the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I, who died in December 1754 – his death was sudden, too, and the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica says he died from heart disease, so it's easy to infer he had a stroke; the ambassador was Roland Puchot, the mentioned (Count) des Alleurs,not Ailleurs as I wrote before (corrected that), who died in Constantinople in late 1754 or early 1755, of a stroke ("un attaque d'apoplexie" according to this source). So, if the sources and Voltaire are to be believed, Pancrace Royer has most probably died of a stroke. 

Life expectancy upon reaching adulthood was shorter in the past than it is today (e.g. you'd live up to age 64 or so on average in late Medieval England if you made it to adulthood). Yes, a nobleman or a monarch, who enjoyed slightly better hygiene than the commoner, and more/better food, would have lived somewhat longer. Primarily, I'd put forward, because the upper classes had food to begin with during famines. 

(Partial answer.) I think three points are worth noting about life expectancy before comparing today's figures with those in the past: 

In the early middle ages or ancient times that might have been the case. But certainly not by the 19th or early 20th century - scientific/darwinist racism was in full swing by then. 17th century France had its Code Noir, and slave codes weren't unique to colonial France, so the quote you cite seems to give an unrealistic picture of attitudes at best. A few centuries earlier, Wikipedia's Racism entry also offers this quote by Ibn Khaldun, a 14th century Tunisian scholar, that probably better captures attitudes then and later: 

Some more info to complement what @PieterGeerkens has found: there's a very scholarly work on the subject on Google Books, Het Bier-oproer te Leeuwarden, in het jaar 1487, in zijne oorzaken en gevolgen by Jacob Dirks; sadly (for me), it's in Dutch and several passages are in Old Dutch or Frisian. But more or less, from what I managed to understand from Google Translate and some common sense, there was a political dispute at the time between the Vetkoopers and the Schieringers (a term that doesn't refer to the community near Leeuwarden but, apparently, to the Cistercian monks' habit, as explained here), which apparently had much to do with both the prohibition and the riots. 

The inscription is in Italian or, perhaps more accurately, in the Tuscan dialect that became the basis of modern Italian. The inscription is written in an abbreviated form, which was usual in monumental inscriptions since at least Roman times and common in manuscripts and early printed books too — the missing letters are replaced, between brackets, when transcribing the text. 

Aside: I can't resist throwing in this Gustave Le Bon quote in passing. He was one of the fathers of social psychology and an influential figure at the time. It perfectly illustrates the rampant sexism that prevailed in those days: 

I would add as an aside that the wedding ring finger isn't universal either. Where in Western Europe it usually is the left finger insofar as I'm aware, it is the right finger in Hungary and, I believe, Russia and Greece. Either way there certainly were conventions. I couldn't locate the specific convention(s) the Romans were using, but sempaiscuba's suggestion (left hand ring finger) seems sane in light of the above. (It's almost tempting to speculate that the sex/status rule might have been introduced by the French at some point between Charlemagne and William the conquerer, with the marital status symbolism following at a later point.) 

Citing: Sverdrup, Carl. "The Military Operations of Genghis Khan and Sube'etei." Helion and Company (May 4, 2017). Page 318. In other words, they weren't aware there was a larger army roaming nearby. 

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to go around the Cape of Good Hope and build several outposts, later turned into large colonies, at Angola and Moçambique, on both sides of the Cape, but none on the Cape itself, as far as I know. I cannot see the sense in that, for I guess that control of the Cape was essential to keep their own routes open for traffic with India – in fact, that was one of the reasons why the British conquered the Dutch Cape Colony. I guess that a powerful enemy navy at the Cape could seriously hinder Portuguese movements, something that I don't know if actually happened at the time of the Portuguese-Dutch wars. So the question is: Did the Portuguese build any settlement around the Cape? And if not, why? 

There were no actual "boundaries" as far as I had been able to research; the Spaniards relocated the natives, not into a closed area but scattering them in some 600 reducciones all around the Viceroyalty, and most of the time the natives appear to have been resettled not excessively far from their original villages, while local chiefs appear to have had a say on the placement of the reducciones. You might want to look at Jeremy Ravi Mumford's Vertical Empires: The General Resettlement of Indians in the Colonial Andes, which appears to be a fine book on the subject — chapter 8 mentions the topic of the placement of the reducciones, and you can see some pages of it in Google Books. In this other text, the author makes a general outline of the thesis he puts forward in the book. 

In practical terms it means the yield increased, because a new select crop produced more per acre, or because the crop or newly introduced techniques produced more frequent harvests, or because better fertilizers and other agricultural techniques were used to increase yield outright. The net result whichever way is you get to feed more people per man-acre worked, hence [population|yield] carrying capacity. 

Disinformation was (and still is) done day to day in political discourses and posturing. Consider two examples, courtesy of Chomsky: 

One way to go about this type of research is to simply dig deeper, one step at the time: review the bibliography of the articles you've run into, and read the citations of potential interest. Rinse and repeat until you finally locate one or more articles that argue about the precise date - historians aren't the type of scholars who take ancient texts at face value, so you'll necessarily run into such articles if you dig deep enough. A shortcut for the above is to head to Google scholar directly, enter something like "Fall of Babylon date", and hit Search. Doing so will reveal a heap of articles that argue about the date and how it was arrived at (i.e. considerations such as astronomy, other events that were occurring at the same time documented in this or that source, and so forth). The shortcut method might require a bit of digging deeper too, but it'll often be faster. This article from the first page of the above-mentioned Google Scholar results, for instance, includes a tasty looking citation in footnote 7. The book is out of print but you can download it from U Chicago: 

Quartó (plural quartons) was the Catalan name of each of the four quarters the island was divided into after the conquest of Ibiza and Formentera by the Aragonese in 1235 (Catalan Wikipedia article about the quartons here). Interestingly enough, a couple of PDF documents (1 and 2) at the Institute of Ibicene Studies (Institut d'Estudis Eivissencs in Catalan) mention that according to official documents from the time of the flag's creation in 1979, its basis had been an alleged flag of the ancient University of Ibiza (no mention was made of why it had four castles). According to the said institute, there's no trace of any flag of the ancient University of Ibiza either, so in 2007 there was a proposal for changing the flag for another, more coherent one from a heraldic point of view, but was ultimately cancelled. 

One example that comes to my mind is the War of the Triple Alliance, perhaps more commonly known as the Paraguayan War, which was won by the said Triple Alliance (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay). EDIT – But to be honest, I don't actually know nor could I find out whether it was called like that while it was being fought; it's pretty probable that it was called either "Paraguayan War" by the Allies and "War against the Triple Alliance" by the Paraguayans at the time.
