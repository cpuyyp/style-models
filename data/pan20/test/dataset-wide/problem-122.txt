Erythrocruorin Erythrocruorin is an iron bearing protein. I didn't find definitive description of its color but I think it would be a light red. 

Heat based limit The TauTona Mine is the deepest mine on the Earth. It is a gold mine. Tip of the TauTona mine iceberg: 

Most of the land would be on the so called "Dark Side" of the Moon facing away from Earth. Most of the region facing Earth would be a giant ocean. Neat stuff Flying Given this atmosphere density and Lunar gravity, people should have no problems flying by putting on some specially crafted wing sleeves and flapping their arms. Imagine mansions situated on Lunar peaks. Physically fit people would visit their neighbors by putting on their wings and flying to the next peak over. Walking on Water People could run across bodies of water without falling into them (surface tension could hold them up). Radiation Protection Despite the lack of a strong magnetic field, this idea has the added benefit of providing plenty of radiation protection. The added mass of air (6x that of Earth) means that colonists are well protected from radiation. 

A little digression on money and what it represents First of all, money itself has little value. We value money because our society has established it as an abstract representation for labor + materials. Thus projects requiring expensive materials or lots of labor cost more money. So how does this affect your question? Assume Project X might be humanity's #1 goal and we might throw all sorts of labor at it. 

There are many more Natural Units (and Universal Constants) at the link and we'd have to work through derivations for electric charge, magnetic fields, etc. 

Introduction You want beans with that? I can think of two natural processes that might generate a very large bubble of gas under Europa's ice. Air under arctic ice 

No Lasers (no longer an acronym for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"), require a couple of phenomenon to provide the beam and the other waves that you mentioned don't have a means of providing one of more of these 3 items. Design First, you must have a "lasing medium", this is a material that can contain atoms with electrons in an "excited" state (meaning electrons are not in the "ground" / lowest energy state) AND remain optically transparent to the lasing frequency. Second, you must have an energy source capable of stimulating those atoms by pumping energy into the lasing medium (aka gain media). Ideally, you want the electrons to be bumped up to the same "non-ground" level state (so they release the same frequency of photon when they drop into the ground state). This can be done through chemical reactions (e.g. $DF$, $OI$, etc.), electrical discharge (e.g. $CO_2$), or by other non-coherent light sources. Third, you must have a "resonator cavity" (usually a tube with a mirror on one side and a partially mirrored surface on the other). Operation The order of operations is this: 

If the alien has bilateral symmetry, bipedal, with four limbs, and a head; it would be appropriate to use the term humanoid - meaning "human like" in appearance. As for the political correctness of what to call thinking beings that are not human; I've always liked terms like "being", "sapient", "sentient", "citizen" (if they belong to the same political entity), etc. As an exercise for the reader... I'd like to elaborate on @LostinFrance 's answer by using a thought experiment. Thought Experiment Pick 5 of the most intelligent creatures living on Earth. For example, based upon EQ. 

2. Survival of the Species Ultimately, ALL life on Earth will be exterminated. In order to survive, humans and/or our descendents must colonize space and other star systems. The smartest thing we could be doing as a species is to build space colonies. Unfortunately, only a sort of benevolent dictator or other such long-term thinking government would be capable of diverting resources for such a venture, unless the species were faced with imminent (10s or 100s of year) extinction. 3. Exotic Matter Exotic particles and matter have been postulated many times. Many of these are not explicitly excluded by modern physics but neither have we seen evidence of them. Some ideas include 

350 g ~ 3150 calories fat 350 g ~ 1400 calories protein 300 g ~ 1200 calories carbohydrates A few g micronutrients 

They are worth \$5.00 - \$500.00 per gram (1/10x - 10x) the price of Platinum, with Promethium being the rarest and most expensive Platinum Group Elements (PGE) And asteroids/meteors tend to have higher concentrations of the Platinum Group Elements: 

I suspect I am a disenchanted oldster who thinks that anarchy, as you think of it, won't work at least in a stable state. Working Anarchy In the The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, individuals obeyed social norms that hadn't been codified into laws. Violators weren't captured and prosecuted by a central government but rather arbiters and citizens who were able to perform those activities. It portrayed a society acting as if it had a government with laws but without those instruments. I feel that such a society is possible as long as the society shares a common sense of values (likely a monoculture). Citizens of this society will behave in most ways as if they did participate in a culture with government and laws so I'm not sure I see the attraction of adding the "anarchy" label. Unworking Anarchy Larry Niven portrays a different perspective on Anarchy in his short story A Cloak of Anarchy. He concludes that it doesn't work because small numbers of bad actors make living in that environment quite horrible. If they gain any sort of power, the society rapidly devolves into some form of authoritarian government. Additional Reading The article Not So Wild Wild West discusses different conceptualizations of what anarchy entails and applies them to a scenario in the American Wild West to see how it would play out. I recommend reading through these for additional thoughts on how different implementations of anarchy might work and what problems they might encounter. I recommend also reading about The Price of Stability and The Price of Anarchy. Other Thoughts My opinion is that anarchy is an unstable state that evolves (devolves) into some other form of government. I form this suspicion because we don't see any anarchic states in the modern world. They simply don't survive encounters with non-anarchic states. I think a "good" anarchic state would be wonderful but such states are completely hypothetical (except at the very smallest scales) and not practical. There's LOTS of philosophical, game theory, and simulation work expended on this topic. If you are interested in the real answer, I highly recommend the reading above. If you're instead just looking for items to make your desired society seem plausible to the reader, I strongly recommend you look at works like The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and similar works for the things they have in common. Not all of these are required in the same setting. 

In order to answer all the problems you pose, you must first understand the nature of your environment. Everything in your proposed environment is in orbit around the primary. This means many of the fundamental notion of motion, forces, and propulsion to which we've become accustomed on Earth will not work the same way. The Motion Some principals of motion for things in orbit. 

The Earth is in thermal equilibrium We can only increase the Earth's temp by about 10 C This equates to about a 15% increase in energy input The Earth's radiated energy is dominated by Sun shine and equals 173,000 TW of power. We are allowed to generate 25,950 TW. 

A post-seeded trajectory A similar mechanism by which pellets of fuel and propellant and/or pallets of other stores are shot at the receding spacecraft. This technique has the added benefit of providing positive momentum transfer to the spacecraft (thus accelerating it), however, each shot must be carefully timed and calibrated to keep from hitting the spacecraft like a hypervelocity weapon instead of a gently captured resupply pallet. Once again, the biggest benefit comes from resupplying the fuel and propellant. Other ship's stores would be nice to add but not nearly as critical to overall mission mass. If something happens to your civilization after spacecraft launch but before all the necessary supplies are launched, then your crew will die. There's simply nothing they can do about it. Important Note It's important to note that in either system, the group launching the supplies must be very careful about the supply's trajectory. 

Most bunker assignees to be of child bearing age but you'd probably want a mix of other ages too. A majority of bunker assignees to be women. You'd want both thinkers and doers (e.g. engineers and mechanics) with a weighting towards the doers. All bunker assignees to be of good physical health and fitness. You'd want to not have any one person possess unique knowledge, otherwise you'd lose an entire set of technology with the loss of one person. Widely different genetic makeup to ensure healthy off-spring 

It will generate a great deal of heat and melt or burn its way through most other materials including steel (the amount it'll melt through depends upon the amount of thermite used). It will ignite nearby combustibles. Perhaps not as fear inspiring as a Molotov cocktail, if used properly it could be highly effective. You could combine this with some other substances (e.g. Titanium and its alloys) to induce fires that are extremely difficult to stop (requiring something like vacuum, dry $N_2$, Class D extinguishers, etc.). Burning Titanium 

You start by meeting the items at the bottom of the hierarchy first, human's physiological needs such as air, water, food, shelter, environment, etc. Expect the pets of certain young and/or irresponsible AIs, who often forget to feed & care for them, to suffer a high mortality rate. However, as you climb the hierarchy what actions need to be done to satisfy those needs becomes less well defined. Perhaps the AIs developed a research project in which they run multiple societies in parallel with the intent of discovering which societies best meet the human's needs in these categories. Perhaps the Earth is this group research project. 

Klemperer Rosettes are unstable. More precisely, they are statically stable but dynamically unstable. Any tiny perturbation from this stable state leads to problems. 

Assume that we need 20x this mass for equipment & consumables for keeping people alive in transit, colony construction equipment, plus sundry other items. Also assume that the ships are constructed in a modular prefab fashion that allows us to directly use them at the destination or dissemble them and use the parts in existing colonies: 

Hitting the Moon with $ 500 \cdot 10^{12} \times 7 \cdot 10^{9} = 3.5 \cdot 10^{24} W$ of power would do the job. Net Net Although xkcd is discussing pushing the Moon away, the numbers are similar for deorbitting it. No one is going to be deorbiting the Moon using weapons fire. 

The problem IMO the reason we don't see more two weapon fighters is because our brains are not sufficiently parallelized for calculating the motions of two objects at a time. Putting this in simpler terms, adding the second weapon decreases our effectiveness with the first. Diminishing returns I think increasing the number of arms to 4 suffers from the law of diminishing returns. In most cases, without special training, just using 3 shields and blocking as many directions as possible, while your primary hand wields your weapon will be the best fighting technique. Real fencing I've actually fenced competitively. Once I start a lunge, I've already decided all of my measures and counter-measures. I go through them as fast as I can without awaiting response from my opponent. I use the time in-between attack and perry to analyze what I and my opponent have been doing and are likely to do and try to figure out my next attack and defense combinations prior to the next engagements. I do not know whether high end fencers do this the same way or they are able to react to the actions of the other fencer in real time. A master Someone who spent years trying to master multi-armed combat might be able to do better, perhaps much better. Even if she couldn't, if she could master a series of automatic attacks and defenses with 3 arms with which she'd simply use muscle memory to control it would provide her with a big advantage. Meanwhile she could concentrate on the attack and defense of her main weapon. Fighting someone like this As someone who would have to face her, you would need to worry about what all of those "automatic" arms are doing because they can still harm or kill you. Even if they're not a huge threat (compared to her primary weapon), they'll still be a huge distraction which probably gives her primary attack (her main hand) a huge advantage. Some fighting styles Ranged:
