Finally, it is interesting to mention the Wikipedia pages on Supermanifolds and Graded manifolds which attempt to discuss the relations between the various definitions met in the literature. 

The classification of hopf algebras is a big and open problem, containing various subproblems (such as: the classification of groups, of Lie algebras, the study of special classes such as (co)commutative, (co)semisimple, pointed Hopf algebras etc). One of the first results, known since the sixties, had to do with the classification of the cocommutative Hopf algebras: 

There has been quite a lot of literature on the applications of $q$-numbers, $q$-derivatives, $q$-deformations, etc, of various algebraic models of physics. Such applications range from $q$-deformations of simple harmonic oscillator(s) and angular momentum algebras to the development of quantum groups and their applications in nuclear physics, particle physics and field theories. They can be -roughly- divided in two broad categories (although experts might argue that such classifications can be made much more fine): 

I do not work in this area but since you are interested in "any reference in KAM theory in the discrete setting" then you might find some interest in the article: Birkhoff Normal Forms, KAM Theory and Time Reversal Symmetry for Certain Rational Map (especially sect. 2). 

(As I understand it, what the above theorem essentially tells us, is that in finite dimension and over a field of characteristic zero, the notions of semisimplicity and cosemisimplicity are equivalent and they are direct consequences of either commutativity or cocommutativity). Now I proceed as follows: If $Η$ is either commutative or cocommutative then $S^{2} = Id$ and according to the above $Η$ will be semisimple and cosemisimple. 

I was revising some old postgraduate notes of mine in homological algebra (written during a postgrad course on the topic, I had taken more than ten ;) years ago) and I came accross the following problem: Weibel's book "An introduction to homological algebra" (which had been among my textbooks by that time), states the following exercise: (ex. $1.4.4$): 

I am not a specialist in either etymology nor the english language (I am not a native speaker of english as well) but since the words scholium and porism have both greek origins, I thought it might be of some interest to add some info on how these words have been used in both ancient and modern greek: The word "porism" comes from the greek word "Πόρισμα" and it indicates something which is a direct implication of the preceding statement. I think the closest in english is corollary. (In non-mathematical contexts, the word πόρισμα also means the conclusion of some work). The word "Scholium" comes from the greek word "Σχόλιο" and it it indicates something which although may be very closely connected to the preceding statement, it does not necessarily stem directly from it (neither logically nor conceptually). In this sense, a scholium may indicate some resemblance with another notion or method from some other field or some distant application, even some piece of info on the origins of the preceding result or its importance from a more conceptual viewpoint. In mathematical texts (in greek) the word "σχόλιο" is often used to discuss something related to relaxing the assumptions of the previous statement or indicating its limitations, under the stated assumptions. (A working translation might be "comment", but i think that in greek it is commonly used to indicate something more important than simply a comment -however I am not a philologist to tell for sure). So, in my opinion, if you want to discuss something which is not a direct implication of your statement but it is proved using methods similar to the argument(s) provided to prove your statement or if you want to provide additional insight then the word "scholium" might be appropriate. If however, you wish to simply present some consequence of a line of argument you have already used, "porism" or "corollary" seem more appropriate -as other users have already indicated in their comments. In case you decide to use it, it would be better to avoid bold letters. Edit: Since the OP's original question is how (and if) the word "Scholium" should be used in a mathematical paper, I feel that the question is of interest to the community of professional mathematics researchers. After all, the question has to do with the way a mathematical research paper is written and structured. However, the community will finally respond, one way or another. Maybe, it would also be instructive (with regard to the OP's original question) to have a look at how the term "scholium" is used in this edition of Euclid's Elements. (see for example the scholia in p.104). Edit-2: Maybe it would be also of some interest to add that in greek, the word "Σχόλιο" has the same root with the greek word "Σχολείο" which means "School". (as has already been mentioned in a comment above, by user Pietro Majer). 

I've solved the exercise but i've failed to find a counterexample for the converse. In fact, I think the converse also holds, but I haven't yet found the time to clear it up. Can somebody help ? 

P.S.: Inevitably, non-commutativity is a central topic in the frame of quantum algebra. In this sense, the above description, may be viewed to encompass even modern abstract tools and theories on the fundamentals and the properties of algebraic operations and structures. It is just that i feel a little sceptical, as to whether a modern "definition" of the field of quantum algebra should be build around the notion of non-commutativity itself.

Motivated from this remark, I was wondering whether this description might be of interest for your purposes. If yes, you can find more details at C. Kassel's book on Quantum groups, ch. $VI$, sect. $2$, p. 125-126 (Prop. 2.1, 2.2). 

I do not think that it makes sense to say that the gauge-fixing is a special case of BRST quantization: $\rightarrow$ The gauge-fixing procedure is actually a normalization technique and it is utilized in order to eliminate unphysical degrees of freedom (gauge directions) in the path integral quantization of the various gauge theories. This -rather naturally- destroys the gauge invariance. A standard method to restore the lost gauge invariance -and thus to recover the physics- is the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) or antifield formalism: $\rightarrow$ after introducing some extra fields in the theory (ghost fields and conjugate antifields), an extended action is constructed involving all these variables. This action is invariant under the BRST symmetry operator $s$ (usually called BRST-differential), which now replaces the original gauge symmetry. Its cohomology essentially contains the physics, in the following sense: $\rightarrow$ The BRST-differential is nilpotent $s^2=0$ and thus its cohomological groups $H^n(s)$ can be constructed. $H^0(s)$ consists of the gauge invariant functions (that is: the observables). You can find more details in these notes and the references therein. Edit: The question: What is the BRST-anti-BRST formalism? and the answer there, are also related and may be of some further help. 

I understand that the above result can be extracted as a consequence of the the Cartier-Konstant-Milnor-Moore classification theorem, according to which, a cocommutative $k$-Hopf algebra is isomorphic to a smash product between the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of the primitives of $H$ and the group Hopf algebra of the grouplikes: $H\cong U(P(H))\sharp kG(H)$. ($k$ is of course considered alg. closed with zero characterictic). However, I want to provide an independent proof. After working a bit on it, I have devised a proof (which I am posting below as an answer) which however makes use of a later result, the so-called Larson-Radford theorem. Could there be some different approach (involving or not the Larson-Radford theorem)? 

Kaplansky's second conjecture (on Hopf algebras) deals with "admissible" coalgebras: He calls a coalgebra admissible, if there is an algebra structure making it a Hopf algebra. The conjecture states that: 

Let a Lagrangian dynamical system with $n$ degrees of freedom and configuration space $\mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e. phase space $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$), which is described by $L=L(q_{i},\dot{q}_{i},t)$, $i=1,2,...,n$. It is well known from classical mechanics, that a sufficient condition for a Lagrangian dynamical system to be equivalently described as a Hamiltonian system, is the Hessian of the Lagrangian w.r.t. the generalized velocities to be non-degenerate: $$ \det\Big|\frac{\partial^{2}L}{\partial\dot{q}_{i}\partial\dot{q}_{j}}\Big|\neq 0 $$ Now the question is the following: It is frequently mentioned in the literature of classical mechanics (but I have not seen a direct proof of this), that the above sufficient condition is independent of the choice of generalized coordinates and depends only on the dynamical system itself (i.e. only on the Lagrangian function and the underlying configuration space). What kind of direct proof could be provided for this ? P.S.: the motivation for posting this question was a student's (not my student) question on whether the property of a Lagrangian system to be Hamiltonian as well, is a purely geometrical property. I am not an expert in the subject but I think that essentially, it suffices to answer the question for the case that the configuration space is $\mathbb{R}^n$. In the sense that the independence of the property of the particular coordinate system used, means that in the general case, it will be a property of the underlying differentiable structure on the configuration space manifold. 

A significant amount of related literature can be found at mathematical physics journals such as the Journal of Mathematical Physics, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, Communications of Mathematical Physics, SIGMA etc. 

I think that a modern realistic perception of the term "quantum algebra" has to be understood in its historical context, that is, the algebraic/geometric methods, originating from the study of the quantization problem in its various forms (first and second quantization , QFTs etc): As far as i know, the term quantum algebra, has been introduced in Dirac's seminal paper "The fundamental equations of quantum mechanics", Proc. Roy. Soc. A, v.109, p.642-653, 1925 (a reprint can be found in Sources of Quantum Mechanics, ed. B.L. van der Waerden, p.307). It was short after Heisenberg had proposed his -revolutionary for the time- idea that quantum observables should correspond to hermitian matrices of -generally- infinite order. However, he considered the non-commutativity of the matrices as an obstacle in the further development of the idea. Heisenberg communicated his ideas to Fowler at Cambridge. Fowler, was by that time, the thesis advisor of Dirac and this is how the latter got involved. Dirac shortly proposed that the non-commutativity of quantum mechanical observables should be treated as a fundamental characteristic of the new theory to be developed. He also proposed that quantum observables $A$ and $B$ should belong in a non-commutative algebra, satisfying the relation $$ [A,B]=i\hbar \{A,B\} $$ as a "measure of departure" from commutativity. ($[.,.]$ stands for the commutator and $\{.,.\}$ for the classical Poisson bracket). A detailed account of the history of the development of the notion of quantum algebra together with references, historical and technical details, can be found at Varadarajan's Reflections on Quanta, Symmetries and Supersymmetries, ch.2. During the next decades, the term quantum algebra started expanding and embracing new ideas and methods emerging from the studies of different aspects of the various quantization problems. Dirac's commutator was replaced by Moyal bracket (coinciding with Dirac's comm. modulo $\hbar^2$ terms) and this is how the deformation theory (already developed as a separate discipline at the level of assoc. and Lie algebras) entered the picture. Now quantum mechanical algebras of observables were viewed as deformations of the corresponding classical objects. Moshe Flato and his coworkers have been among the pioneers at that direction. The rise of quantum groups and $q$-mathematics, expanded the term even more. Now whole new families of examples and methods arose, introducing new mathematical ideas and tools into the subject, such as hopf algebras, $q$-analytical tools, representation-theoretic methods, $q$-deformations of Weyl algebras etc. The continuous development of Quantum Field theories together with the various technical and conceptual problems introduced by them, led to further expansions of the discipline of quantum algebras. Now, algebraic geometric, homological, homotopical and Category theoretical methods and notions got involved. The development of non-commutative geometry, also opened new directions of study. I am far from being an expert into such topics to provide further details but i have the feeling that almost everything inside "quantum algebras" has been in some way connected or at least originating (even in some distant sense) from the study of the quantization problems. So, concluding, i would say that, although the requirement for a one-sentence definition of the topic of quantum algebra might seem superficial, a rough approximation (modulo my understanding of course) might be: 

The above result is frequently referred to, in the literature, as "the Cartier-Konstant-Milnor-Moore theorem". (although it seems that quite a lot of people have contributed to it). Now, my question is: Given that the notion of quasitriangularity extends the notion of cocommutativity (in the sense that cocommutative hopf algebras are trivially quasitriangular through the $R$-matrix $R=1\otimes 1$ and thus quasitriangular are a class of Hopf algebras extending the class of cocommutative hopf algebras) are there similar results to the above, generalizing the Cartier-Konstant-Milnor-Moore theorem for quasitriangular Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero? 

A couple of examples of non-admissible algebras: $\bullet$ It is known (see here, p.222) that a semisimple Hopf algebra is also separable (as an algebra). Consequently, a semisimple but non-separable algebra has to be non-admissible. (An example of such an algebra could be the following: Consider a field $K$ and $L$ an inseparable extension. Then $L$ is a semisimple $K$-algebra but the algebra $L\otimes L$ is no longer semisimple). $\bullet$ On the other hand, another example (outside the semisimple algebras) might be the case of Weyl algebras and their deformations. As far as I know, there is no known Hopf structure for the family of Weyl algebras. Furthermore, in an old paper of T.D. Palev, it is argued that it is impossible to even define a comultiplication on Weyl algebras. See: Is it possible to extend the deformed Weyl algebra $W_q(n)$ to a Hopf algebra? (the discussion of p.3-5 refers to the undeformed case). Edit: $\bullet$ I have recently found an interesting result leading to some other classes of examples of non-admissible algebras: 

I am not sure if the following is the kind of answer you are expecting, but take the (left) adjoint action $(ad_l h)\triangleright k=\sum h_1 kS(h_2)$ of a hopf algebra $H$ on itself. (It is known that the left adjoint action of $H$ on itself is always inner (in the sense of the def. 6.1.1, p. 87, in Montgomery's book "Hopf algebras and their action on rings") and turns $H$ into a $H$-module algebra). If you set $H=kG$, then, the left adjoint action for $g\in G$ reduces to action by conjugation: $(ad_l g)\triangleright k=gkg^{-1}$. More generally, for any inner action $\ \triangleright : H\otimes A\rightarrow A$, it is easy to show that any grouplike element $g\in G(H)$, acts as an inner automorphism of $A$. In case $H=A=kG$ and $\triangleright$ is the left adjoint action then this inner automorphism is the action by conjugation (of the corresponding group element). Concluding, i would say that the notion of an "inner action" (p.674-675) may be the reasonable notion you are looking for.
