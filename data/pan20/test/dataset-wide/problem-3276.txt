How does a linguist determine whether a pattern is grammatical in a language? Is there some kind of standard test? This is assuming that there is little documentation of the language and no authority. For example, without documentation, corpus, or authority, how can one determine whether S + [be] + V+ing is valid in English? Just make an example to a speaker and ask if he thinks it's grammatical? But there are dialects and individual dialects (idiolects), how can the linguist be sure that the grammaticallity is not just the test subject's dialect? How can the linguist know that the example sentence he gives can be generalized and is not an exceptional case (for example, some verbs cannot have S + be + Ving such as words of emotion). 

My understanding that 100% accurate parsing (analyzing a text and creating a syntactic tree) is an impossible task for computational linguistics at this moment. However, there are many heuristics or approximation algorithms that produces good enough results. Do we have some kind of metric to rate the effectiveness of these algorithms? How does it work? For example, I guess we can run the algorithm against a set of text whose syntactic tree we already know and then compare the program's output against the known sytactic tree? Or do we use other methods? Are there already well-established metrics/scoring system to rate parsing? How do they work? 

--Impersonal vs. personal "you", Dr. Lameen Souag Wikipedia also list Russian as an example. As far as I know, the French uses on (not a second-person pronoun) for this purpose, and formally English uses one. 

When we read the news related to dying languages, normally this is painted as bad news and it's really important to preserve the language, see Language at risk of dying out (Guardian) or Digital tools 'to save languages' (BBC), for example. Is this view shared by most linguists, or is it mainly the view of news reporter or anthropologist? If we think about it, maybe human communication would be better off if we have fewer languages. The diversity of languages cause communication difficulty, and in some cases can even cause conflicts, war, etc. So what are the scientific reason for preserving dying languages, if any? 

Say we want to know whether his son or the product is the subject of this sentence. Relying solely on the fact that subjects can be clefted in English does not help us determine which of the two NPs is the subject. It is better to test with yet another syntactic construction until only one of the NPs is eligible to a construction, such as matrix-coding-as-object: 

The neuter noun kné follows a-stem declension. But it comes from Proto-Germanic *knewą. This seems to be a wa-stem. Then why does it follow a-stem declension? Did Scandinavians force it to, even though it was wa-stem noun? 

What books / resources about analysis on Esperanto (and English) are recommended to get me started on such comparison? 

I believe his soni _i to have stolen the product. *I believe the productj his son to have stolen _j. 

I'm reading the paper Constraints on Null Pronouns by Speas, in which the author defines two constraints for a cross-linguistic OT analysis of the occurrence of null pronouns across languages: 

I don't understand the text in bold at all. Does it mean the gen. sg. ending might be either -s or -ar, or does it mean something else? Also, in A Dictionary, I find (-s, -ar) written right next to noun entries, like this: 

TL;DR: How can we use syntactic phenomena that target subject to design tests for subjecthood (or even possibly derive a cross-linguistic definition of subject)? I am reading Van Valin's An Introduction to Syntax. It has many interesting examples of "syntactic phenomena that target subject", for example, reflexivization, relativization, wh-question and cleft formation and so on. To my understanding, such phenomena often always target the subject but not necessarily exclusively so; they can sometimes target other grammatical relations, such as English cleft formation, which can certainly target direct objects as well as subjects, as demonstrated by the following sentences: 

My understanding is that the two constraints are close opposites to each other (one asks featureless pronouns to be bound, one asks pronouns to be unbound), and the important point of the author's argument is that different languages allow different occurrences of the null pronoun since they rank these two constraints (and 4 others she mention) differently. However the issue is whether this oppositeness always holds. I think that depends on whether the C-Domain of a null pronoun would always match with its Binding Domain, but I cannot answer my own question. Any thoughts? By the way, the author considers the null pronoun to be a featureless pronoun. Thus null pronouns are subject to both of the two above constraints. 

There really isn't just one high-level, abstract, "language production/comprehension process". That view would be much Chomskian and is now generally derided. Language production/comprehension is the result of cooperation between several cognitive capabilities. There are definitely overlaps for spoken and sign languages, especially in meaning comprehension and production (not in the sense of the final muscle movement, which is different of course). There would also be differences, in terms of concrete perception mechanisms. Language acquisition researchers also looked into the acquisition of sign languages (e.g. for children that are born deaf). Those who had normal parents showed demonstrably worse results than those with also sign-language using parents, presumably because the normal parents can't provide an immersion environment. This is the same as what happens in the acquisition of spoken languages. 

Are the languages spoken in various Arabian countries actually mutually intelligible? If no then it makes more sense to regard them as separate languages. In China the government likes to officially categorize various Chinese languages as "dialects", but the reality is that the difference is really huge between some of them, e.g. comparing Mandarin and Cantonese is more like comparing Italian with Spanish than American English with British English. Most Mandarin speakers don't understand nor speak Cantonese at all. Therefore there are many language codes for various Chinese languages as well and it makes sense to me. I wonder whether the situation is similar in Arabic: If you can't even understand some of the Northern African Arabic then how can you claim they're the "same language"? Some people might try to do so politically but linguistically it would be far-fetched. The situation is just fundamentally different from American vs. British English I suppose. 

For typological questions you can consult related databases, such as The World Atlas of Language Structures (the most widely used), AUTOTYP, SSWL to get the answer. As mentioned, Arabic might be one such example. 

One research group at our university is particularly interested in the statistical properties of language. One professor, Michael Ramscar, is teaching us some classes this semester on related topics. And basically the idea is that this kind of logarithmic/exponential distribution is considered optimal in an information theory point of view, since it ensures that the entropy of the whole probability distribution would be the lowest, ensuring the most effective communication in general. Some of these ideas can also be found at his blog, for example this article about the distribution of names. P.S.: Actually he also made the argument that the "Zipfian power law" view is not entirely accurate while an "logarithmic/exponential" distribution might be a better description. He said that the shape of the curve under the Zipfian power law would be largely impacted by the sample size, while the shape of the curve under simple logarithmic/exponential distribution wouldn't, because it would only have one parameter, while the Zipfian power law distribution also gets a scaling factor besides the simple exponential factor. I'm not sure I completely got this point to be honest, but the point about entropy should still stand regardless, since I think Zipfian distribution is basically logarithmic/exponential as well. 

Since matrix-coding-as-object applies to his son but not to the product, now we are more confident that his son is the subject in (3). The above process is what I think is the utilization of syntactic phenomena that target subjects, which are observations that certain types of constructions only involve subjects (or potentially other grammatical relations as well), as tests for subjecthood in a sentence. By transforming a given sentence into constructions of one or more of these "certain types", we see if the resulting constructions are grammatical or not, and determine the subject based on such results. The more tests we apply, the more confident we are about our judgment. Is this process correct, or canonical in linguistics? From tests for subjecthood, can we possibly derive a cross-linguistic definition of subject? I personally don't consider this possible, since we are only "more confident" about a constituent being the subject of an examined sentence with increasing number of tests we apply; we are never 100% confident. 

I assume by the "Binding Domain" of an α the author meant the Minimal Governing Category for α, which consists of: 

I know Esperanto is constructed on the basis of Romance languages; but what are the main differences and similarities between English and Esperanto? Especially from the following aspects: (how are words constructed and orderly connected? what classifications / parts of speech does English / Esperanto have?) vocabulary (from what languages does English / Esperanto borrow terms / derived words?) semantics (words in what languages share similar connotations and implications with English / Esperanto words?) 

Modern Icelandic maður is from Old Icelandic maðr. To relate the latter to the former, I would say "Old Icelandic maðr is the ___ of Modern Icelandic maður." What linguistic term goes in the blank? Is there another term for a meaning the other way round, i.e., that fits the blank in this sentence: "Modern Icelandic maður is the ___ of maðr." I thought about ancestor for the first blank and descendant for the second, but I am not sure if this is correct linguistic terminology.
