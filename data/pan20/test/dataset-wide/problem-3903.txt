This inequality is not true. Here is a counterexample: Let ${\bf x},{\bf y} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with ${\bf y} = 0$ and ${\bf x} = (1,\epsilon)$ for $\epsilon$ small positive. Let $g(x,y) = Cy^2$ with $C(\epsilon)$ very large, chosen say so that $${\bf x} - \nabla g({\bf x}) = (1, -M)$$ for some $M$ large. We now construct $f$ convex so that $\nabla(|x|^2/2 + f)(2,-10) = (1,-M)$ and $\nabla f(0) = 0$, which would violate the desired inequality. We rewrite this as $\nabla f(2,-10) = (-1,10-M)$, $\nabla f(0) = 0$. Take $$f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(C_1y^2 + C_2(x+y)^2)$$ for $C_1,C_2$ to be chosen momentarily. Then $$\nabla f(2,-10) = (-8C_2, -10C_1 - 8C_2), \quad \nabla f(0) = 0.$$ Taking $C_2 = 1/8$ and $C_1$ so that the second component is $10-M$ (if $M$ is large then $C_1$ can be chosen positive, making $f$ convex), we are done. The constants in this example are somewhat arbitrary; geometrically, the point is that we can make $g$ "very monotone" in one direction so that the non-expansivity of $(Id + \nabla f)^{-1}$ can't save us. 

The equation $F(D^2u) = g$ for $g \in C^{\alpha}$ should have a $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate by perturbation theory. See for instance Caffarelli-Cabre, Ch. 8. The idea is that the constant-coefficient equation $F(D^2w) = f(x_0)$ has a $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate (Evans-Krylov), so by using the quadratic approximation to $w$, ABP, rescaling and iteration we can produce a paraboloid approximating $u$ to order $O(|x-x_0|^{2+\alpha})$. (Since we use ABP I think that some Holder condition on the growth of the $L^n$ norm of $g$ should suffice). 

Functions in $F$ and $T$ are, at least around a level set where the gradient is nontrivial, the same up to "reparametrizations preserving level sets." To see this, assume that $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is in $F$, that $0$ is a nontrivial level set of $f$, and that $g > 0$ in a neighborhood of $0$. If we take a function $h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $h(0) = 0$ and $h'(z) = \frac{1}{g(z)}$ then the function $\tilde{f}(x) = h(f(x))$ has the same level sets of $f$, and furthermore $$|\nabla\tilde{f}| = h'(f)|\nabla f| = 1,$$ so $\tilde{f}$ is the signed distance from its $0$ level set nearby this set. Heuristically, we "adjusted the heights of horizontal slices of $f$" so that it becomes the distance function. As a simple example, take the simple example $f(x) = |x|^2$. Since $|\nabla f| = 2|x| = 2\sqrt{f}$ we have that $f \in F$. Then taking $h(z) = \sqrt{z}$ we transform this function to $|x|$, the distance from $0$. If we have any increasing radial function we can do the same. More generally, one can view the above discussion as saying that any $f \in F$ can, around "nondegenerate level sets," be written as some reparametrization of the distance function from this level set. 

Let $M=\mathbb{R}^n/G$ be a closed flat manifold, and let $F\to M \to N$ be a locally trivial submersion, where $F$ and $N$ are closed manifolds. My question is simple: are $F$ and $N$ homeomorphic to flat manifolds? This question seems quite natural to me, and I would expect the answer to this fact to be well known. Any reference will be welcome. Thank you in advance. 

Question: is there some relative version of the Serre spectral sequence that allows me to compute the relative cohomology groups of $(E,E')$ from the cohomology of $(F,F')$ and $B$ (case 1), resp. the cohomology of $F$ and $(B,B')$ (case 2)? Some reference would be perfect. If some topological assumption on the spaces or maps are required, I am dealing with classifying spaces and Borel constructions applied to smooth actions on manifolds, so it is very well behaved stuff. 

I will start by saying that I am not a symplectic topology. However, in my research I now have on my hands a symplectic 4-orbifold, which I would like to understand better. Certain results for symplectic manifolds (e.g. Weinstein’s Lagrangian neighborhood theorem), if true in this more general setting, would help immensely. Therefore, I would like to know if the theory of symplectic orbifolds has been developed at all, and if so, where can I read about it. Again, I am mostly interested in 4-orbifolds, so even results in this dimension would help. Thank you in advance! 

So, the question was answered by Alexander Lytchak. I am writing down the answer for the sake of completeness. Consider the fibration between the universal covers $F'\to\tilde{M}\to \tilde{N}$. $\tilde{M}$ is contractible and $\tilde{N}$ is simply connected, thus we can apply the Serre spectral sequence with integral coefficients, and from it we obtain that $F'$ and $\tilde{N}$ are contractible. In fact, if $H^*(F')$ has cohomological dimension $a$, and $H^*(\tilde{N})$ has cohomological dimension $b$, then $H^*(\tilde{M})$ would have cohomological dimension $a+b$ and this has to be $0$. Then $N$ is acyclic, and from the exact sequence in homotopy so is $F$. Moreover we have and exact sequence $$ 1\to\pi_1(F)\to \pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(N)\to 1$$ where $\pi_1(M)$ is a Bieberbach group, i.e. a torsion free group with a finite index normal abelian subgroup. As for $\pi_1(F)$, a subgroup of a Bieberbach group is again a Bieberbach group and therefore $F$ is homeomorphic to a flat manifold. As for $N$, one can prove that there exists a normal abelian subgroup of $\pi_1(N)$ of finite index. Moreover, $\pi_1(N)$ is torsion free, since otherwise there would be a finite cyclic subgroup acting on the contractible manifold $\tilde{N}$ without fixed points. This is not possible, and therefore $\pi_1(N)$ is a Bieberbach group. Again, this implies that $N$ is a Bieberbach manifold. 

It is a good exercise to show that for a function $u: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity is equivalent to the following: there exists a linear function $l_x$ such that $$\|u-l_x\|_{L^{\infty}(B_r(x))} \leq Cr^{1+\alpha}$$ where $C$ is uniform. The forward direction is clear; for the other direction, observe that for points distance $r$ apart, the linear approximations differ by $Cr^{1+\alpha}$ nearby these points, so (up to changing $C$ by constants depending only on $n$ and $\alpha$) their slopes can differ by at most $Cr^{\alpha}$. Actually, in the proof above I only needed that I can choose $C$ uniform on neighborhoods. This is crucial; as Pietro notes, we can get this property at a point (say 0) by taking an arbitrary bounded function and multiplying by $|x|^{1+\alpha}$, which clearly doesn't give $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity away from $0$. The equivalence of "pointwise $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity" with uniform constant and $C^{1,\alpha}$ is the basis of most approaches I know to proving $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates in PDE. This is usually done by estimating a solution with a linear function, rescaling, and improving the estimate geometrically, i.e. finding $r_k \rightarrow 0$ and $l_k$ so that $$\|u-l_k\|_{L^{\infty}(B_r(x))} \leq r_k^{1+\alpha}.$$ One can analogously define "pointwise $C^{k,\alpha}$" by approximation with $k^{th}$ order polynomials to get Holder estimates on higher derivatives. 

Also, in two dimensions (real case again) one has special techniques such as the partial Legendre transform (obtained by taking the Legendre transform along lines in some direction $e$). If $\det D^2u = 1$ then its transform $u^*$ is harmonic and $u^*_{ee} > 0$, and one can get an upper bound for $u_{ee}$ by using the Harnack inequality to get a positive lower bound for $u^*_{ee}$. 

To do De Giorgi-Nash-Moser it is important that $f$ is in $L^q$ for $q$ larger than half the dimension. A heuristic is scaling: if $v$ solves $-\Delta v = f$, then the right side for the rescaling $v(\epsilon x)$ is $\epsilon^2 f(\epsilon x)$, whose $L^q$ norm is like $\epsilon^{2-n/q}$, so zooming in helps when $q > n/2$. When in dimension $4$ or higher, one can take e.g. $v = \sum h_k\varphi(2^k x)$ for some smooth $\varphi$ that is $1$ in $B_1$ and vanishes outside $B_2$. Taking $h_k = 1/k$ makes $v$ unbounded ($\log\log$ growth near the origin) while $f := -\Delta v$ is $L^2$ (the integral of $f^2$ is like $\sum h_k^2 2^{(4-n)k}$). It seems to me that for such a choice of $f$, the solution $u$ will immediately become unbounded since $u - v$ is unbounded initially and solves the heat equation. Note also that indeed, in Deane's computation, the (reciprocal) exponent on $f$ looks like $n/2$ for large $p$. It is important to use that $f \in L^q$ for $q > n/2$, for instance as follows (in the elliptic case for simplicity): Let $A_p = \left(\int u^{p\chi}\right)^{\frac{1}{p \chi}}$, with $\chi = n/(n-2)$. Applying Holder to the last term in the first line of Deane's computation gives an inequality like $$A_p \leq (pC(f,S))^{1/p} A_{\gamma p},$$ where $\gamma < 1$ depends on $q/(q-1) < \chi$, and $C(f,S)$ depends on $f$ and the Sobolev constant. Iteration gives $$A_{2\gamma^{-k}} \leq C(f,S)^{\sum j\gamma^j} \|u\|_{L^2(Q)}.$$ Taking $k \rightarrow \infty$ gives an $L^{\infty}$ bound in terms of the desired quantities and the Sobolev constant. I'm not sure how to remove dependence on the Sobolev constant. 

It is well known that the Stiefel–Whitney classes $w_i$ of a smooth manifold are generated, over the Steenrod algebra, by those of the form $w_{2^{i}}$. I wonder if it the same statement is known/true in the case of odd primes. More precisely Question: Given a smooth manifold $M$, is it true that the Pontrjagin classes $p_i\in H^*(M,\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})$ are generated, over the algebra of Steenrod powers, by those of the form $p_{q^i}$? In the case of the Siefel-Whiney classes, that fact can be obtained using the formula $$ Sq^i(w_j)=\sum_{t=0}^i {j+t-i-1 \choose t} w_{i-t}w_{j+t}. $$ As far as I understand, such a nice formula does not exists in the case of odd primes. Nevertheless, my question is much weaker, and I have the feeling it should be known, at least in the case $q=3$ (which I am mainly interested in). EDIT: As Oscar points out, the answer to this question is NO for $p\geq 5$. As far as I see it, though, it is not trivially false for $p=3$. 

First of all, by Morse theory you know that $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching an $m$-cell to $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. $\mathcal{M}^+=\mathcal{M}^-\cup_{\phi}e$, where $e=D^m$ is an $m$-cell and $\phi:\partial(e)=S^{m-1}\to \mathcal{M}^-$ is some attaching map. Therefore you can compute $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ by excision (you excise $\mathcal{M}^-\setminus\phi(S^{m-1})$), and get that $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\simeq H^{\*}(D^m,S^{m-1})$ that has exactly one nonzero cohomology in degree $m$. As for the second question, I think it's more intuitive looking at homology (it's the same since we are looking at coefficients in a field). There you have the sequence $0\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\stackrel{\partial}{\to} H_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^-)\to M_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^+)\to 0$. Moreover, the generator of the unique nonzero class of $H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ can be thought of the fundamental class $[e]$ of the cell you attached, and $\partial[e]=\phi_*[\partial e]$. In other words, the boundary operator sends $[e]$ essentially to the class of its topological boundary. If $\partial[e]=0$, it means that $\phi_{\*}[\partial e]$ is a boundary in $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. there exists an $m$-cycle $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ such that $\partial[e]=\partial[e_-]$. In particular $\partial[e-e_-]=0$ and you can say that $e$ can be completed to a cycle, contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point}. Think of the usual example of the torus, with the morse function being the heigth $z$. Let $p_1$ be the second critical point (the first critical point of index one) with critical value $z_1$, let $\mathcal{M}^-=z^{-1}([0,z_1-\epsilon])$ and $\mathcal{M}^+=z^{-1}([0,z_1+\epsilon])$. Then $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching a $1$-cell $e$, that is a little segment passing through $p_1$ and "going down". Its boundary $\partial[e]$ is just two points in $\mathcal{M}^-$. You can check that $\partial:H_{1}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_0(\mathcal{M}^-)$ is zero, and in fact $\partial[e]$ is the boundary of an arc $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M^-}$ (for example the arc through the minimum point). it's quite clear that we just "completed" $[e]$ to a cycle $[e]-[e_-]$ (that you can see as a closed nontrivial closed curve in the torus) that is "almost entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point. If $\partial\neq 0$, this means that we are killing some cohomology, that we created at some point before. Take for example the sphere $S^2$, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the shape of a "$\bigcap$", and again with $z$ as a Morse function (just wiggle it a bit so that the two minima have different values). Then from bottom-up, you first see two index $0$ points (the two minima), that give you two 0-cells. Then, as you go to the third critical point (the first critical point of index 1), you notice that $\partial \neq 0$ and so the contribution of that critical point is to kill something we created before. In some sense then, this morse function is not "efficient", in the sense that creates too many critical points, that will be killed later anyways. An "efficient" Morse function only creates critical points when they really contribute to the homology of the space. "Efficient" Morse functions are called perfect. Here is the formal definition of perfect morse function: as you said, every critical point of index $m$, might give rise to at most one new generator of $H_{\*}(\mathcal{M}_+)$. So if $c_m$ denotes the number of critical points of index $m$, we have that $c_m\geq \dim H_{\_*}(M)$, where $M$ is our manifold. The Morse function is called perfect if the inequality above is an equality, for every $m$. 

A linear uniformly elliptic equation of the form $F(D^2u) = 0$ can only be $\Delta u = 0$ (up to an affine transformation of the solution) since the only inputs are the second derivatives. Equations like $a^{ij}(x)u_{ij} = 0$ are of the form $F(D^2u,x) = 0$. If $F(.,x_0)$ is concave for each $x_0$ (corresponding to freezing the coefficient in the linear setting) and $F$ is Holder continuous in $x$, then we get $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity by applying Evans-Krylov and a perturbation argument (see ch. 8 of Caffarelli-Cabre). This is a generalization of Schauder estimates. A more interesting concave equation "built out of" linear ones is the Bellman equation, $$\inf_{\alpha}a^{ij}_{\alpha}u_{ij} = 0$$ where $a^{ij}_{\alpha}$ is a collection of uniformly elliptic constant-coeffient matrices. For the second question, the proof actually gives $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity for a $C^{1,1}$ viscosity solution in all of $B_{1/2}$. Indeed, one shows the oscillation decay of $D^2u$ (as an $L^{\infty}$ map) $$diam(D^2u(B_{\delta^k}(x))) < 2^{-k}\|u\|_{C^{1,1}(B_1)}$$ for some universal $\delta$. It follows that $D^2u$ is Holder continuous up to modification on a set of measure $0$. By using quadratic approximations to $u$ at nearby points it is straightforward to show that $u$ is in fact $C^{2,\alpha}$ everywhere. (Think for example that the function $\chi_{\{0\}}$ cannot be the derivative of any differentiable function, since if it were it would lie close to a line of slope $1$ near $0$ and violate being locally constant away from 0). As a side note, it is an interesting result of Armstrong, Silvestre and Smart that for any uniformly elliptic equation $F(D^2u) = 0$ with $F \in C^1$ we get $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity off of a set of Hausdorff dimension $n-\epsilon$ for some small universal $\epsilon$. 

This is actually pretty cool. Superharmonic functions bounded below in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are constant, while there are nonconstant superharmonic functions bounded below in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 3$. Here is a proof that doesn't use complex analysis, and only uses that the fundamental solution in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ($\log(|x|)$) is unbounded from above and below, and the maximum principle. Slide $u$ so that its minimum on $\partial B_1$ is $0$. Take the fundamental solution $f(x) = -\log|x|$, which is $0$ on $\partial B_1$. Since $u$ is bounded below and log is unbounded, $\epsilon f(x) < u(x)$ for $|x|$ sufficiently large (depending on $\epsilon$). By the maximum principle, $u(x) \geq \epsilon f(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2 - B_1$ for all $\epsilon$. Taking $\epsilon$ to $0$, we see that $u \geq 0$ outside $B_1$. But then, we see that $u$ takes its minimum in $\bar{B_1}$, and by the mean value inequality any superharmonic function with an interior minimum must be constant! This result is false in higher dimensions. For a counterexample, just take the fundamental solution $|x|^{2-n}$ and cap it off above in $B_1$ by a paraboloid and smooth it out. 

Question 1: is it true that $\phi$ is homotopic to an isometry of $S^n$ in $Diff(S^n)$? Here is a (probably) much stronger assumption on $\phi$: fix a basis $x_0,\ldots x_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and suppose that $\phi:S^n\to S^n$ preserves any subsphere "main subsphere" $S^{n-k}=S^n\cap \{x_{i_1}=\ldots x_{i_k}=0\}$. Question 2: is it true that $\phi$ is homotopic to an isometry of $S^n$ in $Diff(S^n)$? Regarding this second question, my approach was to start deforming $\phi$ to be an isometry on the smallest "main subspheres", and hopefully going up in dimension, but this requires me to know that $\pi_i(Diff(T^k))=0$, $i>0$, where $T^k$ is a $k$-dimensional torus. So here is a third, kind of related, question: Question 3: is it true that $\pi_i(Diff(T^k))=0$ for every torus $T^k$ and every $i>0$? Thanks in advance! 

Let $B$ be a simply connected space, and $F\to E\to B$, $F'\to E'\to B$ two fibrations with a map $f:E'\to E$ sending fibers to fibers and inducing the identity on $B$ (in my case $f$ is injective but I don't think it matters). Let $f:B\to B'$ be a map between simply connected spaces, $F\to E\to B$ a fibration, and $F\to E'\to B'$ the pullback with respect to $f$. Here as well, I deal with $f$ being injective. 

EDIT: I was rightfully asked what I mean by Euler characteristic of the (non compact) manifold $\tilde{M}$. My answer right now is: the one you want! What I am thinking of, is $\chi(\tilde{M})=\sum_i (-1)^i\dim H_i(\tilde{M},k)$, with $k=\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $H_i$ are either the usual or the compactly supported cohomology groups. In my case, $\tilde{M}$ retracts to a compact Lie group. 

Suppose you have a standard sphere $S^n$ and a "standard" $S^{n-2}\subset S^n$. I am really thinking about $S^{n}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ the usual sphere, and $S^{n-2}=S^n\cap \{x_0=x_1=0\}$. Let $S^1$ be the circle "orthogonal" to $S^{n-2}$, i.e. $S^1=S^n\cap span\{x_0, x_1\}$. Then $S^n$ gets decomposed by the hypersurfaces $S_t:=S^{n-2}(\cos t)\times S^1(\sin t)$, i.e. the distance tubes around $S^{n-2}$ and $S^1$. Suppose now that $\phi:S^n\to S^n$ is a diffeomorphism such that:
