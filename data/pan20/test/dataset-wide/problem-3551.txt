Let me begin by saying this is not about an injury. There is no pain during or after my workout (apart from the normal feeling of a muscle straining to lift heavy weights). It's simply that my inner thigh seems to be working a lot harder than it used to 20lbs ago. The feeling runs along my inner thigh as if it could be my sartorius or adductors, but I don't see how either of those are related enough to the squat to be staining during the lift. This makes me wonder if maybe my form is somehow incorrect and as a result an inordinate proportion of the load is being offloaded onto those muscle when it should be on the more major muscles (VM, VL, glutes, etc.). Is there any common form mistake that would result in a load transfer from the prime movers to the sartorius or hip adductors? Or is it that the sartorius or hip adductors are more vital to the squat than I suspected; meaning it is to be expected that they feel strained under a heavy load? For what it's worth, I'm aiming for a wide stance, low-bar squat. And when I say wide stance I mean like an inch or two more than shoulder width and with feet pointed out 30Â°. 

Firstly, only your doctor can know if your levels are actually low enough to cause these symptoms, so you should ask them. I'm only including the rest of this answer to let you know it's worth asking. As it relates to fitness, low levels of testosterone can lead to reduced muscle and bone mass [1]. Low muscle mass (and presumably reduced muscular gain) is obviously bad if you're interested in getting stronger or bigger. Reduced bone mass is bad for just about any kind of exercising that involves impacts or heavy loads, like running or lifting, because it increases your chance of injury. 

Incline shoulder raise seems to be the best option. The same link lists clap pushups and depth pushups as good plyometric options, since, from your comments, that seems like it's more in line with your current exercises. Alternatively, the sarretus is involved as a stabilizer in most anterior deltoid exercises, like the over head press. There are a lot of programs (like SL 5x5) organized around the idea that small muscles like this should be trained only as stabilizers in larger, compound, functional exercises, like the press. 

I really like Strong Lifts, but it isn't working well for me anymore. Too many resets and not making it past previous resets. Admittedly, my lack of progress is likely attributable more to my lack of proper nutrition and sleep than to a fault in the program. I've been told that Greyskull is a good intermediate program, so I reason that it requires less recovery than novice programs like SL. But I do wonder whether it is possible for someone who is still a novice to make progress on an intermediate program. Is the following enough stimulus to cause significant adaptation? The reason for making a hybrid is that I like BB rows, but they are not feasible in GS. I would just include them as an add-on to bench days but, on days with bench, row and deadlift, my deadlift would suffer from fatigue from the rows. A day: 

If you're willing to workout and eat a lot (as you said you could in the comments on Eric's answer), you'll get bigger, barring rare metabolic conditions. Just get a beginner strength program like Starting Strength and eat >2800 calories a day with 40% of that being protein (and protein powder is acceptable). You also mentioned "medical treatments" in the comments. There are no medical treatments that will make you look more athletic without exercising. Even illegal steroids require you to lift weights to see any benefit. 

Note: the 1x5+ set is an AMRAP set, with a minimum of 5 to be considered successful. And these would be alternated on MWF, like SL. As in, one week, A on Monday, B on Wednesday, and A on Friday; then the opposite next week. And I'll be using GS weight increments. That's 5 lb increases on Squat and DL and 2.5 lb on everything else. Weight is increased any time at least 5 reps are completed in every set. About me: I weight around 200 lb at 5'8" and my current squat 1RM is 225 lb and bench is 165 lb. My goal is primarily strength. 

Everyone who benches knows and fears the torn rotator cuff. So it makes sense to be preemptive in avoiding it. Assuming I'm healthy and uninjured, what single exercise can I do to help avoid the tear? (Preferably a compound exercise, but since the goal is to strengthen a stabilizer, I understand if this isn't possible.) The suggested duplicate is a question about rehab (i.e. answers targeted at people who are already injured), whereas mine is about prevention in healthy individuals. 

So I'm in the first week of c25k and just finished my second run/walk, but even in the first week I had to skip one of the running periods. My ankles and the front of my shins were so fatigued that my feet weren't lifting. What exactly can I do if I can't even do the first week of c25k? Should I just do the first week over until I can get all the running periods? It's maybe important to note that I'm doing this concurrently with SL 5x5 which I've been doing for a long time. I can't help but wonder if the lifting caused this. The first time I ran was after a day off, but today I ran after lifting just yesterday (squat 3 sets of 5 @ 250lb and DL 1 set of 5 @ 275lb). I don't remember my ankle being as tired last time. I weigh 200 and an 5'9 with a bf% of around 25. 

First, nice icon. :) Second, just listen to your body. No one can say how much is too much (and will lead to overtraining). Just familiarize yourself with the symptoms of overtraining and be aware of it. There's a difference between being lazy and being tired from overtraining. If you find yourself excessively tired and without motivation or you find your workout getting harder instead of easier, then you may need to adjust your workout schedule. If not, then there's nothing wrong with working out everyday.
