A couple notes Part 2 is written on the assumption that you'll be fired/have your offer pulled if you fail. It is possible, however, that they don't care about weed, only hard drugs. Don't count on this, though! Now sounds like a great time to go clean. If they do pay for your travel expenses and then want to get rid of you, that is just their tough luck. If they demand money, say no (unless you have explicitly agreed to recoup their expenses if you fail, which would be pretty weird for them to demand--businesses also spend money on background checks and don't ask people to repay them if they fail). 

No, I don't think you should do this. In general, it's not a good idea to ask for a raise until you've been there at least a year, and asking too early might make you look out-of-touch, or worse, entitled. The fact that you're still in your probationary period makes this even stronger. I hear that you're getting great feedback, but great feedback at your 30-day and 60-day reviews means "You are learning this job well," not "Wow, you are so awesome that we should pay you more than we agreed three months ago." An exception to this is if your job changes so substantially that it's really become a different job, and one you'd have negotiated a higher salary for. But it doesn't sound like that's the case here. You're doing the same job; it just got harder. It doesn't make sense to ask for a raise in that case; otherwise should everyone get a raise every busy season? Should they give you a raise now, and then take it away when they hire more people? It's better to just keep doing a good job, and ask about a raise after a year. If you do well on this project, be sure to bring that up then. And congrats on your new job! 

Short answer: No, don't say anything. Long answer: You say you'd like to "express some form of support for him and his family in light of what the current US president-elect has said regarding his religion and Muslim Americans," which is all well and good in theory, but has a number of drawbacks in real life. The biggest is that it could easily sound like you think he's afraid, which would be condescending and insulting, unless he's said something to this effect himself. In general, your boss does not look to you for political and emotional support. It's a nice idea, but it just doesn't work in the context of a boss-employee relationship, especially one where you "know very little about his personal life." It's also possible (though less likely) that he would get miffed because he in fact supports Trump himself. It's good that you want to support your boss, though, and there are ways to do that. Socially/personally, you should intervene if you witness anti-Muslim harassment against him or anyone else. Remember, you can Distract or Delegate as well as intervening Directly! Politically, support the myriad institutions and organizations that would fiercely oppose any attempt to round up or register Muslims, like the Becket Fund. 

If the behavior is so extreme that it amounts to a hostile workplace in the legal sense, you can of course involve HR. If it falls short of that, but is still disruptive to work, someone should speak with the offender's manager. The person whose work is being disrupted should be the one to do complain, and that's probably one of the women, not you. But you asked about what you, specifically, can do to be supportive (and anyway, the situation may not be bad enough to involve management or HR). So this is about that. 

That's a matter of company policy/practice, and you should ask the hiring manager (or whoever first told you about the requirement). If it's a pre-employment drug screening, I would guess that they'd have you complete it at a lab wherever you are, before they bring you to Georgia. But you really have to ask them to be sure. If you fail (test positive) before you arrive, they probably won't even bring you down. If they wait until you've arrived to test you and you fail, they'll probably have trouble with their project, but not substantially more trouble than they'd have if you'd failed back in Canada. They'll have spent money on your travel, but that's a risk they accept if they do things this way. (Many companies also pay travel expenses for candidates to get to interviews, even though they obviously don't hire everyone.) 

I think you should tell Company A sorry, but you already accepted a job with someone else. Withdraw from the application process with Company A. Accepting Company B's offer and then ditching them after a month is unprofessional and unethical, and will damage your reputation. You can, however, tell Company A that you'd love to work with them in the future. Then in a year or so, you can apply to another posting and also email them to say you're you couldn't take the last job but you're still really interested in joining their company so you'd love to be considered for this position, etc. 

They should give you advice and presumably ought to hassle your employer to send you your stinking W-2, because my goodness. 

If you're just going on hearsay, that's true (unless you're the guy's manager, in which case you have standing to investigate). 

Naw, man, you don't have to be a personal friend to call someone out if you witness them being rude or a jerk. Since you're talking about things that "taken separately, probably wouldn't be considered a big deal but, taken together, are very demoralizing for my female colleagues," don't make it into a big deal. Just address them separately, at the time they happen. What's on your side here is that most demoralizing sexist remarks are impolite, so you can address them the way you would address other rude things. Say "Dude, not cool," or "What the hell, man?" or "Why would you say that?" or whatever form of "Wow, that sucks. You shouldn't have done that" you would use if he had cursed in front of a child, hawked a loogie onto the floor, or committed any other not-cool but not-cataclysmic misdeed. Your specific role here, as a man, is to foster a culture where it's not cool for men to act like that. Don't get into the big picture--that discussion is too easy to derail into a pointless argument. Focus on enforcing a social norm. I can tell you from personal experience that women will notice, and we will appreciate it. 

Ugh, I'm sorry. You've gotta talk to somebody, I'm afraid. You could talk directly to his manager (the "I'm having a problem with your managee" conversation), or you could talk to your manager and she could talk to his (the "I'm having a problem at work and need my manager's help" conversation, followed by the "Manager to manager, you need to deal with this" conversation). What he's doing might constitute sexual harassment, but I really don't know about UK law. Even if it doesn't, you could go to your manager and say "I've tried ignoring this, but it bothers me so much it makes it difficult for me to work. What can we do about it?" Of course, your manager might just say "Tough luck," or "What a sensitive snowflake; you're fired," but that seems unlikely. But it would be better to focus on this: 

how do I not come off as a creep? If your gaze-wandering was as minimal as you say, you probably didn't. This is especially true if you've already had "professional and cordial" interactions with her, so she knows you as more than that guy who kept looking at my legs. I don't know if she noticed but I am inclined to believe that she did. You're right; she probably did, but she could probably also tell if you were "really trying [your] best to keep [your] eyes on her face," which reduces the chances that you made her uncomfortable. Asking her to pull up a chair was a good idea in any case--if nothing else, it's generally easier to have a conversation with someone at the same height as you. I can't help feeling guilty about my wandering gaze Kudos to you for noticing you do this and trying to stop! You should carry that laudable effort into the rest of your life--keep doing this when you're interacting with women at the store, on the bus, on the sidewalk, in the rest of the office, etc. Not only is it good to treat non-colleagues as respectfully as you treat your colleagues, but with things like this, it's important to train yourself in the habits of keeping your gaze in check. You're not going to be able to always look your colleagues in the face if you're ogling every woman you see on the street, so if you have been doing that, this is your reason to cut it out. should I try to clear the air by apologizing to her for my possibly-unprofessional behavior, or simply ignore the incident and keep mum about it? Definitely keep mum. If you were honestly working to keep looking her in the face, you didn't do anything wrong. If she did feel uncomfortable, I don't think bringing it up will make her more comfortable. The way to do that is to just go ahead and be impeccably respectful and professional in the future. 

Hopefully, you've saved your earnings and leave statements/pay stubs, so you should be able to file your taxes anyway. You have to do this! Even though your employer is being unreasonable, the IRS will come after you if you don't file. 

This is fine. If your informal name is considered childish or goofy, that could be a reason not use that particular name, but there's nothing inherently unprofessional about going by a name that's not your legal name. Plenty of people do this--William goes by Bill, Aleksander goes by Sasha, Katherine Anne goes by Anne, Xu goes by Sarah, Jane Married goes by Jane Maiden, whatever. Here's how you do it: Continue to go by B. Sign your emails as B, introduce yourself as B, put B on your business cards. This is all totally normal and not a cause for concern. You're worried about "[a]pplying for a job with A and then having to clarify [you] go by B." It might be awkward if you go through the whole hiring process as A and then announce on your first day that you go by B, but there's no rule that you have to apply to jobs with your legal name! It's better to just start with the name you go by professionally. You can put B on your resume and cover letter. Introduce yourself as B at the interview. If you accept an offer, then when you get to the new-hire paperwork stage, say, "Just so you know, my legal name is A, so that's what I'll need to put on my I-9 [or whatever your country's equivalent is]." Keep introducing yourself as B. Relax. There's nothing weird about this. 

If and when you get your W-2, you may have to amend your return. This is a pain, but if it turns out you've overpaid you should get a refund (possibly with interest, depending). "Fine. Sue me." Your boss sounds like a piece of work. IANAL, but I doubt suing him would be productive or a good use of resources. You could, however, hire a lawyer to write him a sternly worded letter instructing him that what he's doing is illegal and he'd better cut it out. Some people will buckle in the face of such a letter. This guy, on the other hand, might not respond to anything short of an actual lawsuit (which would be expensive and time-consuming). You and your husband know him better than I do, of course, so you should think this over in light of what you know about him. 

I'm sorry, but I think you just have to get over that. Jobs are not a reward for charity work. You keep your job by doing it well and in accordance with company policy, and he's not doing that. If it helps, your company can take his charity into account if they want, but that's their call, not yours. If you just want him to change his behavior, you could talk to him, but that kind of conversation generally carries a subtext of "Or else I'll talk to management," and it sounds like he'd take it badly ("I don’t want to risk being under someone that knows that I know their secrets, especially since he has a reputation as being unpredictable during conflict"). So you don't have a lot of other options here, unfortunately. In the meantime, you can make your day-to-day life a lot easier if you avoid looking at his screen as much as possible. It sounds like you've actually read some of the messages he's sending, which requires more than an accidental glance. Make a concerted effort to look at your own screen. Good luck!
