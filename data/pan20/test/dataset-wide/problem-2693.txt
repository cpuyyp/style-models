Given all that, it should be obvious that "empiricism versus rationalism" is a false dichotomy. We get knowledge both ways and more. ~~~ As for, "What extent, does our knowledge derive from our senses?" Whole books can and have been written on just aspects of this, the question is very broad. Consider a typical scene in our moment-to-moment existence, we might learn the following "facts" (probably automatically and without consciously realizing/verbalizing them): (a) The remote is there, while (b) the beer is there, but (c) the wife is standing there. (d) She's holding a garbage bag. (e) I feel tension in my jaw. In that scene, we know quite a bit directly from our senses, but most of our sensory data is filtered into responses and/or concepts automatically, then the raw sense data is mostly discarded. The individual photons and pressure waves are vital, but do not matter in and of themselves. Note that we all can (and do) trust our senses with our very lives. Sure they have limitations and can be tricked, but these limits are almost always outside of what is required for our day-to-day survival. We would have long ago been crocodile chow were it otherwise. The limits of our senses are now known; they are predictable, and consistent across individuals and species. Now back to that scene. The individual photons, sound waves, etc. were sensed, but it was how we accurately interpreted them that mattered. All animals have innate knowledge built-in to help interpret their senses into the fundamental (to life) concepts of the need/opportunity to: fight, flee, feed, or f..., er, fornicate. It's automatic, but it is knowledge, and it is objectively right most of the time (or our parents wouldn't have lived long enough to breed). This knowledge was designed into our bodies by evolution -- a kind of meta induction. So, at a fundamental biological level, the most important knowledge we have is not sense-percepts, but concepts that Mother-Nature inducted for us after collectively processing lifetimes of sense-percepts. Even the existence and design of our senses is a kind of built-in knowledge. One thing that biology and neuroscience is teaching us, is that there is not "mind" versus "body", and there is no "inner control room" to the mind. A mind cannot exist without a body, and the whole body affects the mind (and vice versa). "Thought" and "knowledge" occur across a spectrum as a process; the structure of our brains greatly affects what we "know". Studies of siblings suggest that "Nature" is still a substantial part of who we are and that "nurture" can effect only so much. So, as animals, much of our knowledge is built in. We learn things via our senses, but it is how we interpret our senses, via deduction (most of it automatic) that keeps us alive. As humans, we transfer massive amounts of information to each other via training and language. Initially, this information would have been concepts inducted from sensory observations by our ancestors (Or prepackaged by God, if you wish). But, then new deductions could be made from those concepts, initially devoid of sensory data (discoveries in astronomy and physics have been made this way). However, in Science, such deductions are worthless unless they are eventually supported by sensory data. Summary: Sensory perceptions are the bedrock upon which all of our (useful, verifiable) knowledge is built. But, the bulk of what we currently know and use was long ago inducted into concepts or into the very design of our bodies and minds. Today, concepts, innate and otherwise are the dominant factor in our knowledge and in our survival. 

I suppose some of the distinctions I'm about to make depend upon the strand of Buddhist thought to which you're referring. I'm going to approach this from an ancient Indian Madhyamaka perspective. 

You can ask any adoptee about this, if by 'real' you mean biological. If you use 'real' to mean a set of nuclear parents -- a mom and dad -- then Plato would say no -- psychological problems arise when you are raised by flawed parents, not through the perfect guardianship and programming of the philosopher-king state. 

As for my own thoughts, well, Imma suspend judgement on this non-evident matter, but here's what Plato had to say: 

I would think that such a machine would theoretically preclude nirvana, not refute it. One of the hardest concepts to wrap one's mind around is the cessation of grasping for nirvana. 

This is an excellent question. There is no reason why group homes for old people ought avoid similar disrepute as group homes for children -- abuse, neglect, and a thousand other human evils are certainly visited upon some of those people, too. Maybe we just care about old people less. Babies and children are cute and seem to have promise, whereas old people, well, I think we (as a society) often just wish they would die already or otherwise go away. Plato thinks old people who have aged out of the breeding program ought to just be able to enjoy the small pleasures of a life well-lived, at the state's expense. 

I definitely think "my death" is a concrete object, though, perhaps, 'my mortality' is an abstract one. There's lots of experiences I will never experience, but I don't think that necessarily means they are abstractions. 

I think the confusion derives from the language(-game?) embedded in the question itself: can something that is limitless be bound by limit? You don't even need to ask the ancillary questions if you can't answer that one. It seems our use of language is already defining-down or hemming in the idea of 'growth without bound' by yoking it to 'somethinghood,' the ontological status of an object, which necessarily has limits. An omnipotent god both can and cannot do all of those things you said since saying a thing 'cannot not' do something is, in fact, imposing a restriction upon omnipotence. "All" is necessarily the union of can and cannot. In fact, I think we probably need to invoke tetralemma here, since infinite can surely bust any law of excluded middle, n'est pas? To talk about the truth of infinite power, we must say that: can, cannot, both can and cannot, neither can or cannot. Mahayana helps. 

The entirety of the argument seems a bit weird from my perspective, however - the end goal seems to be "If God exists (and wants to be known etc etc etc), then rational people should hold the existence of God as a self-evident truth (i.e. a fact?), rather than relying on deriving God's existence from facts". I guess it's about holding the belief as a fact rather than a derived fact... perhaps the argument could be clearer by not referring to facts in the conclusion. This seems to assume that there is only one way to rationalize a belief. You'd do well to have multiple paths that explain and support a belief - that way, should you forget a node or should a node be proven false, the belief still stands, and so do the beliefs built on top of it. If you only kept the shortest "path" of belief, and something low-level got disproven, you could find yourself in a problematic situation as you can no longer tell what is real and what is not. 

You need a sixth point as said by Taemyr, that "A method of knowing God without interpretation exists". Without this point, it doesn't make sense to abandon the facts. Because if there is no such method, then by abandoning the facts, there might not be any other method, completely failing God's goal as asserted by point 2. The 3rd point ... we could argue a bit about definitions, but "all powerful" doesn't have to mean "all knowable". Although I'm not sure if there is no knowledge that can not be gathered given infinite time and energy... depending on what interpretation of causality you hold to be true, there might be a point in time at which your God does not know of such a method yet. At that point in time, facts would be preferred. ... Maybe circumvent this by making God all knowing? Although then the standard "all knowing vs all powerful - if you know how to create a rock that you cannot lift... are you really all powerful? If you don't, are you really all knowing?" -type arguments might pop up and invalidate the argument by contradiction. The 4th point is also flawed; usually facts are things which are true in and of themselves, so for them to require interpretation, you'd have to be playing fast and loose with the definition of a fact. The 5th point also has a flaw: You do not need "the most effective method". You only need a method that attains the best result. ... And these could very well be facts.
