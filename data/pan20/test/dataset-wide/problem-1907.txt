Timing is everything. If you have a great idea, email it to your boss from your work account to his. If he is checking and responding to work emails on a Saturday at 10 then he is engaged. If it is his weekend and he is off, he will discuss it Monday. With regards to employee concerns and complaints, it never looks good for you to complain about an employee to your boss outside of a meeting at work. Even then, it should be approached as rational and work related. He or she is having trouble with the workload, can I help? He/she seems distracted, there are a lot of errors... If you personally attack them it only looks bad on you. Saturday night via text? Looks like an inebriated rant... He was right to involve HR if that's not how you normally communicate. You messed up, depending on your boss, I would apologize and then get to work. Hopefully he hasn't written you off... 

I was an international consultant and an expat for 7-8 years. The idea/impression I have got by your tale, is that you are being taking advantage of in order to take from you a negotiation leverage. Stalling tactics, misrepresentation about your importance in the project/representation, hiding details about the importance of a project and often huge sums of money involved, and even flat out lying about limitations/problems in the terrain, are more the norm than the exception on these cases to minimize the compensation and maximize the profit. The general idea is committing you to a project, and once you are in and abroad, out of view, and reporting to the customer, you cannot back out. I would insist in coming back in your allotted flight, if not to prepare mentally your immediate family and yourself, and to bring stuff/suits more suited to a long stay. As for compensation, usually, abroad and international positions are very well paid for technician consultants, and more so to sales people. I was a technical consultant abroad, and I got complimentary flights home to visit family (that could be converted to another location or given to family), at least 2.5x my salary during the stay abroad, pocket money to spend, car, gas, accommodation, and often full expenses paid, depending on the project. I was also handsomely showered with training courses. Senior/sales people often got 5x the salary, commissions on top (I have no ideia whatsoever of the value of the commissions), and often monthly flights home when kids and wife were involved. Being abroad also entitles you to extra holiday days. Cant remember how many, it was significant, however it varies from country to country. The market is not as strong as it used to be, however I doubt things have changed much in that respect...and you mentioning big organisations involved makes this answer much more relevant. Usually there is also a vibrant expat community around/expat forums where you can try to double check the normal conditions offered to people in the same conditions. I have lost already a relationship, and almost lost another due to these shenanigans, however it was my own personal choice. Do not let this happen to you, especially when you are not having any material gain in the process. Do not embark in this without having a face-to-face conversation with your partner, and even then be wary of it. These projects tend to take longer on time, speaking from experience. e.g. it won't be only 4 months. Usually when in a committed relationship, this is not a decision to be taken only by yourself. To get it down to earth. If I was being paid above 150k-200k I would not mind in professional terms to be moved overseas; if bellow, and without further compensation and an extended time overseas, I would fire myself. I would not linger for the end-of-year review. When we were proposed to move overseas in my company, people were very clear about the numbers and due compensation. Bottom line: You are doing business, not messing up your life for the benefit of others. P.S. For the benefit of other future expats; beware of offers without home OR without factoring the cost of a local home in the salary (for instance upwards 3K-5K Euros in Luanda for an apartment, 20K-30K Euros for a Villa per month or 300 Euros/night in the few decent hotels). 

I got recently contacted by a headhunter about new job. While I am totally happy at my current position, the job offer was so interesting, that I decided to apply for the job and see how do I stack up. However, the new company hiring process is 100% online and one of the steps requires to fill in my personal data, namely Skype account for later interview (should I pass tests which are automatic) As a tester by profession, I discovered bug on the page: My skype account is connected through my Microsoft account and therefore my Skype ID is my e-mail adress. However, the web form for inserting skype account has a validation which refuses sign to be entered into the field intended for skype. So, I told as a form of joke, that I definitly fulfill requirements for a good tester, because I am finding bugs even before being hired. I got back answer that I should describe this to the support of that website. I did describe the issue and got back answer, that this id going to be escalated to the DEV team of the site and I will be contacted back. Next working day I have been contacted by headhunter about what is the resolution, where I basically copypasted answer from the support. The day after, I got again contacted by this headhunter, asking me about if I got any resolution of this issue. (No). So I got asked to let the headhunter know if I receive any answer from the support until end of the day (Did not get any solution and told headhunter so). The last e-mail from headhunter literally reads: 

Using your machine has a cost. It will depreciate faster, the risk of breaking something or getting robbed is greater. Using a company machine means the depreciation, maintenance (and possibly insurance) costs are supported by your employer. I would ask for a Mac on the grounds of being more productive ; if not possible, having another brand does not mean you have to use Windows; whilst our corporate image is Windows, the development team is using almost exclusively Linux, and I myself as the senior network/system administrator use a notebook with Mac, another Lenovo notebook with OpenBSD, and a PC with FreeBSD. Some of us have Windows VMs for the odd task that require Windows in our private cloud, that we can use at work, or at home via VPN. 

TL;DR: I am stuck in hiring process because of wrong validation of one of the automatic steps of hiring process for new tester. As already experienced tester I know that fixing bugs costs time. But recent communication with headhunter let me in belief that such issue should be fast fix. How much should I push the issue to know if its fixed? 

2. Select main areas which need to be improved and stick to them No one wants to hear that their CV has 302 issues. Select two most important and stick to them 3. Use "sandwich" approach: 

Instead of inconveniencing people, buy all the stuff online and ask for delivery at your place. You will arrange for it to be delivered around early morning time, so you can manage a backup plan on the possibility of something going wrong. The small extra added cost is well worth having a store doing the delivery. Eventually if the firm is big enough, a local family store may be even more than happy than receiving an automated email asking for such stuff. PS. I used such services in 2016 xmas, around a time of a surgery, and bought in a big super market chain pretty much all the food, cakes, drinks for xmas, 200 Euros of goods that were delivered at my door at an arranged day and hour. The extra cost of delivery was between 4 and 6 Euros, depending on the time of day. 

Our office assistant has a lot going on personally with a sick family member and stress. She is openly verbal about her personal issues. I offer a confirming ear sometimes daily. At the same time, everything at work is negative. She complains about all the little stuff to anyone who will listen. She is constantly speaking ill of other employees to other employees. Her communication had lessened regarding missing deadlines on important tasks which directly affects other departments. She makes snide remarks and slams doors and has become hostile. When I confronted her regarding the unnecessary comments stating its not acceptable to open my office door, make a snide remark and slam my door while I was on a customer call she started crying. I asked if she was ok? She said she feels like she can't do anything right and she isn't going to make it here. She can't get projects done and it's too much work. My boss spoke to her as well and she cried. We both tried to be rational asking for the same things to make sure we were on the same page. For example, we said if you have a task that isn't completed you need to communicate it so we can assign another team member or re-prioritize for the following week. Her response with us both was an emotional "I feel"... The last person in the position doing the exact same task worked 15-20 hours. She does far less and is at 32 plus overtime. I would like to look for another assistant because I don't think this one will stay/ or we can make her productive and happy. Any tips? Update- she was hired by my boss to complete admin duties. The previous position did data entry projects and errands. I did not hire her but am expected to provide her with work and manage those projects. My boss gives her other projects to complete. My question is should I look for another assistant? How can I repair this relationship? How can I speak to someone who is not rational and only cries and talks about their feelings when I present issues with completing her work. 

Also, my question is: What is the ratio? If you are only two people in team, then logically the ratio of answered e-mails should logically be 50:50 To me, it sounds like "one last drop" - your colleague might feel like he is answering all the e-mails, while you do nothing. So if someone tries to judge you for not answering low prio non urgent e-mail, their motive could be "I had it enough" So next steps: 

In my country is usual to have two types of wedding announcement: Wedding announcement I believe this is the best for you. It is simply official info about the wedding: 

I would not use company property in holidays, or not even take a potentially expensive notebook to an hotel, not mine and much less from work. I would also not take the initiative of opening the door for suggestions of working on holidays just for the heck of (mis)using company property. If I were in your shoes, for pure holiday purposes, I would buy the biggest phablet I could get for watching netflix and gaming. It is far less intrusive than using a laptop, can be used in much more places including near the pool, can be used for gaming, for taking photos, for GPS in a car, and also have a mobile Internet contract in case the Internet in some places is not good. In addition, it is easier to carry on holidays than a laptop, and you can keep using it after the holidays for your free time. You can also carry it pretty much of the time instead of leaving it unattended in an hotel room. 

Tell something good about a part which needs to improve Tell what needs to improve in that part Tell something nice (something else than in step 1) about the part which needs to improve 

Now. As a tester I know that fixing bugs can take some time and sometimes much more than just several working days (especially if it is generally minor issue like validation affecting just one user). But, previous conversation made me feel like that issue should be fixed soon and I will be able to continue the hiring process. While nothing is critical on my side about if I will be hired or not, it makes me now bit nervous in how should I proceed next. On one hand I do not want to look desperate in needing new job by pushing the headhunter about how to proceed next. On another hand I would like to know if a job posting several levels better (and thus several levels more demanding) is something I could fit for or not. During describing this issue, I offered the headhunter that I could create new Skype account to meet the form validations. But obviously, I would like to keep this option as very last one. How should I proceed next?
