Life takes energy from some source and generally changes it into a higher-energy system, kind of a localized anti-entropy. They need some form of energy to process. Energy can come in any form, life will probably figure out some way to deal with it. If you had a lot of magnesium and oxygen it could probably burn the magnesium internally, there are thousands/millions of chemical combinations that could produce the needed energy. If you have a temperature differential it could be harnessed. In our world this exists in the deepest parts of our ocean near volcanic rifts. I suppose if you provided an electric charge for long enough some form of life would evolve on top of it. Problem is, ALL forms of energy will eventually run down. We're lucky that our energy comes from a source that has been/will be viable for a duration that's nearly incomprehensible, but any form that is stored "Underground" will be much more limited (Unless, I suppose, it's some kind of gamma radiation based form of life.) 

I'd have to say long rod/cigar shape for flexibility. What I haven't seen mentioned--it would pivot better than any other shape, allowing you to get any part (Except the dead center) out of the way of an incoming attack almost instantly. With a little extra fuel you could pivot on a point besides the center. Note that this pivot can take place in any axis. Longest distance of acceleration for cheap guns like rail guns where you are just flinging inert matter. This can also be used to drive the ship (Accelerating hydrogen, for instance, to near the speed of light would be a great drive). Large surface area for mounting external "smart" weapons like rockets. Smallest profile if the combat is one on one since you can point right at your enemy and he would have to hit you head-on. Also smallest profile in flight so you are less likely to hit space junk--only one small end section of the ship needs to be hardened against abrasion from interstellar hydrogen/micro meteors. Could spin for gravity if you like when outside of combat. Inside combat I think the spinning for gravity would negate nearly every combat advantage though--but the change might make for some interesting story devices. 

Ants and bees don't seem to have any "fear", and I don't think it's because they are insects... I think it's because they don't evolve as individuals, they only evolve as a unit (with the queen), so self preservation wouldn't even be a trait available to their gene pool--however the desire to protect and defend the hive as a whole would be as strong as our self-preservation instinct. 

I'd say #1 would be media, I think that's been covered. Second though I wouldn't go for military (Bigger isn't always better there) but I'd say bodyguard would be excellent. This should also pay pretty well. Construction--they would be able to work much more quickly than quite a few more traditionally sized humans--especially once we came up with tools & procedures fitted to them. This could apply to any physical labor that needed speed and precision (Cranes would be comparatively slow) Athlete--Unless we created (Racist?) laws against them how long until they absolutely dominated football teams? Basketball would become a joke. Pro Wrestling? A Farmer that didn't need machinery... A Sea diver/salvager that could practically wade out to sea. A Reality show extra (Imagine what those guys looking for gold on that island could do with one)... A Sex worker (Yes, it would happen!) Most of these would pay quite well I'd think. 

If you can still play Steam games it assumes you still have electricity. Why not just put a blinking bright light on the roof of your house? Perhaps a cluster of turn-signals scavenged from cars? I'd also consider a radio transmitter for longer range contact. Should be pretty easy to come up with something that broadcasts your location on a loop over some AM frequency.. 

Development is often driven by need and opportunity. if your country had an abundance of steam power everywhere (like at Yellowstone) then people might start figuring out how to use it before fire (Heck, it might delay fire's invention since you could cook and be kept warm by steam). I could see picking a particular vent and jamming rocks into it so that pressure would build until the rock came flying out at speed. Weaponizing that wouldn't be a stretch if such holes were abundant. At that point you might use wood/fire and even coal just to make your steam-ballistics portable because you are so familiar with the way the steam engines and weapons of war work--you might ignore other technology paths altogether for a time. Currently our power generation--from coal to nuclear--all rely heavily on steam technology, it's still THE primary method to convert heat to movement (Wind is the other big one I can think of right now). It might just turn out that there are undiscovered steam solutions to some of our existing problem that are better than our current solutions but we never found them because a portable heat source was harder to deal with than electricity/explosive force. If you could dig a hole anywhere and pour water in and have it turn to steam I'm pretty sure that would be the core of nearly all the machines in the world. Another way this could happen--suppose your civilization evolved on a highly radioactive world and was therefore immune to it. If you could find rocks hot enough to make water boil for an extended period of time, why would you ever need another power source? But as far as I know you'd need steam to convert that heat into movement (There is probably a way to convert it straight to electricity though, but that might be considered more of a gimmick or toy--just like we'd consider a small steam engine a toy) 

The rockets we use today are simply a way to eject matter out the back of the ship at the quickest possible rate, pushing the ship in the opposite direction. Anything you shoot out of one end has to be matched by something you shoot out the other (I believe mass x speed must be equal from both ends if you don't want to move, but it might be more complex than that--still the concept holds). The faster you shoot and the more matter you shoot, the stronger the push. So anything you shoot (with a cannon/railgun) at the other ship costs double if you want to hold your orbit. Whatever you use should either be self motivated (a light drone full of fuel that acts both as thrust and payload, perhaps) or extremely light (bullets/pellets) or slow. Self motivated drone: The drone can be self-correcting to a degree, but every bit of velocity it gains between you and your target decreases it's maneuverability and increases your target's chance of evading. If it accelerates the entire way to your target and your target dodges, The drone would have to fire the same amount of time just to cancel it's acceleration. Then it would have to start accelerating back to the target (assuming you and the target were originally not moving relative to each other). Basically if you miss you're done. Slow stealth drone: This would lead me to say that the best bet might be a stealthy and extremely light drone. Fire it slowly towards where the enemy will probably be then it needs to just float dead until it is near your enemy. At that point it should light up, quickly orient itself at the enemy and fire full engines. This would minimize the time the enemy has to dodge, and since you don't need it to get there quickly you won't have to compensate much (assuming your ship launches it) or at all, but the enemy detecting your drone would completely nullify/waste the attack, all it would have to do is not be where the drone expects it to be when the drone gets there) A spread of bearings would be better if detection is possible--but that requires closer range--the further you are away the bigger the spread would have to be to guarantee a hit (and the more bearings, the number of bearings is probably geometrically related to the distance and linearly related to the targets thrust capability, but my physics is way to out of date to do more than guess about that).
