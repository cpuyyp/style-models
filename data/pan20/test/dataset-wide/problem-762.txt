A star may approach a super-massive black hole (SMBH) so closely that the tidal forces of the SMBH tear it appart. The distance to the SMBH at which this happens is often referred to as the tidal radius. For a (non-rotating) SMBH with a mass in excess of about $10^8$M$_\odot$, the tidal radius is within the event horizon and hence this process is invisible. About half (depending on the initial orbit of the star) of the stellar material is caught by the SMBH onto a elliptic orbits (the other half escapes on hyperbolic orbits), but due to gas interactions and dissipation (shocks transfer orbital energy into heat which is then radiated away) it soon circularises to form a (or contribute to an existing) accretion disc. (Note that feeding from stars is not thought to be the main mechanism for the formation of accretion discs; a more likely process is the direct infall of gas clouds). Material in the accretion disc orbits the BH on nearly circular orbits. It cannot simply fall into the SMBH because its angular momentum is conserved. However, gas at adjacent radii orbits at different velocities (differential rotation), i.e. the disc is shearing. Viscosity in the gas then causes angular momentum to be transported outwards, mass being transported inwards, and the material to heat up. The material in the disc is a hot (presumably) magnetized plasma, and the viscosity is thought to be provided by the so-called magneto rotational instability. The time scale for this process is, however, very long and only becomes efficient ($\sim10^6$yr) rather close ($\sim100$AU) to the SMBH. The temperature of the disc material is extremely high, such that it radiates in the X-ray and UV, visible as quasars. This radiation is the main energy output from the accreting BH and constitutes about 10% of the gravitational energy gain $mc^2$ ($m$ being the mass accreted). This radiation interacts with any surrounding material (including the outer accretion disc itself, in particular if it is warped), generating an outflowing wind (by its radiation pressure) and possibly preventing further accretion (this corresponds to the Eddington limit). The rotating magnetized disc may also generate collimated bi-polar outflows, commonly referred to as jets. However, IMHO, only a small fraction of the energy can be emitted in these jets, already because the jets have low entropy (they are dominated by ordered motion), while the hot disc has high entropy. 

The second critical parameter is the beam width. Beam width depends highly on frequency: beamwidth = wave length/dish diameter When you use several dishes in an interferometer, you can increase their effective accuracy and decrease their collective beam width. A bit more info on the mechanics of the Lovell telescope: 

Answer based on a misunderstanding of the question, left here because it contains some useful background on WISE. The pie-shaped patterns starting in 2010 are results of the WISE mission (see the video description). The radial pattern within those pie shapes is not explained by my answer. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a space telescope launched in 2009 to map the entire sky in infrared wavelengths. 

As the other answers have said, it's a matter of distance. Not just directly (large distance = small gravitational effect), but also because large distance = long orbital period. If Planet 9's orbit is 10,000 years long, it has moved across a very small portion of its orbit over the past 100 years, so the force vector of its gravitational attraction has moved across a very small angle. That alone makes the wobble much harder to detect than the wobble caused by e.g. Mercury with its 3-month orbital period. Here's a graph that illustrates which objects we can see with current technology, and which are below the limits of current technology. 

The easiest way is to look it up, e.g. here: $URL$ Because the moons' positions change, and they are too small to distinguish in a small telescope, there are no general rules. 

So, servo motors and presumably, calibration are what enables this accuracy. The Lovell telescope has 2 elevation drive motors with gearboxes on each side of the dish. These can be driven so that one motor pulls the dish, and the dish drags along the second motor. This eliminates gear backlash in the system: the two gear trains are "wound up" in opposite directions. This means they can make adjustments without gear backlash interfering.

this is not really an answer to your question, but to the assumption you made. The BH in the galactic center cannot grow that much. There are two problems. First, there is not enough food close by. Any potential food (gas clouds, stars, and dark matter) will have some non-zero angular momentum preventing it from coming close enough. Loosing this angular momentum is difficult (it cannot be radiated away like energy), the only way is to exchange it with other objects either via impact (of gas clouds) or gravitational interactions with other objects (not the BH). The second problem is that a feeding BH is surrounded by an accretion disc of hot gas. In that disc, angular momentum is slowly transported outwards and mass inwards via viscosity (that viscosity most likely originates from turbulent magnetic fields that become unstable -- the magneto-rotational instability). This process inevitably heats the accretion disc to very high temperatures ($10^{6-9}$K) such that it emits a wind of raditation and particles (similar to the Solar wind, but much much stronger). If the BH feeds too much, this wind becomes so strong that it pushes away any further infalling material (potential food). This second process limits the growth of any BH to double in mass in no less than about $10^6$ years, I think (I'm not too sure--if you want a precise value, consult the literature), even if the first problem was no issue. 

These are in contradiction with a Solar binary nature: a viable binary has a large orbital velocity that would put the Sun outside of the typical velocity for local stars. This contradiction can only be temporarily avoided if the current (but not in $\sim1000$ years) orbital velocity and the velocity of the massive binary companion add up to a typical stellar velocity. This is an unlikely chance. Binaries with a stellar-mass black hole always form from an ordinary stellar binary, with one of the stars going supernova. Often, such binaries are quite compact. All this is ruled out for the Sun. Finally, black holes of intermediate masses (100 to $10^5$ M$_\odot$) haven't (yet?) been detected unambigously (though there are several objects that have been claimed to be such intermediate-mass black holes also IMBHs). 

you can see the telescope is perpendicular to the solar panels, so it'll tend to look at objects perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, which causes the bright bands you see in the video. $URL$ 

No, "dark fluid" is not a synonym for dark matter. The Daily Mail article derives from a press release by the EPFL and an article in Science magazine, neither of which mention the word 'fluid'. We don't know what dark matter is yet. There are several theories. One of them compares dark matter to a fluid: 

(emphasis mine). So they're not saying dark matter is exactly like a fluid, they're saying dark matter has some properties that are comparable to the behavior of fluids. 

OSIRIS-Rex has been spotted on its approach to Earth, at a distance of approximately 7 million miles (12 million kilometers) away, with a brightness of approximately 25th magnitude. The Large Binocular Telescope was used for this observation, this has a pair of 8.4-meter mirrors. 

It depends on the composition of the atmosphere. In a helium (or other light gas) atmosphere, your voice would have a higher pitch. If the gasses are heavier, your voice drops. The density is also a factor: on Mars, sounds can't be as loud as on Earth. Sound is transmitted as pressure differences, and the largest pressure difference you can get is that between the atmospheric pressure and a vacuum. The speed of sound also changes with the composition and pressure of the atmosphere. This would change the way you perceive the distance and direction of an object that makes a sound: we normally use the tiny differences in time between a sound reaching our left ear and our right ear. A different speed of sound screws up those time differences. 

Appendix: orbit averages Orbit averages of $v_rf(r)$ with an abitrary (but integrable) function $f(r)$ can be directly calculated for any type of periodic orbit. Let $F(r)$ be the antiderivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $F'\!=f$, then the orbit average is: $$ \langle v_r f(r)\rangle = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v_r(t)\,f\!\left(r(t)\right) \mathrm{d}t = \frac{1}{T} \left[F\left(r(t)\right)\right]_0^T = 0 $$ with $T$ the orbital period. For the orbit averages required in $\langle\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}\rangle$, we must dig a bit deeper. For a Keplerian elliptic orbit $$ \boldsymbol{r}=a\left((\cos\eta-e)\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}+\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\right)\qquad\text{and}\qquad r=a(1-e\cos\eta) $$ with eccentricity vector $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\equiv\hat{\boldsymbol{h}}\wedge\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ a vector perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\boldsymbol{h}$. Here, $\eta$ is the eccentric anomaly, which is related to the mean anomaly $\ell$ via $ \ell=\eta-e\sin\eta, $ such that $\mathrm{d}\ell=(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta$ and an orbit average becomes $$ \langle\cdot\rangle = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;\mathrm{d}\ell = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta. $$ Taking the time derivative (note that $\dot{\ell}=\Omega=\sqrt{GM/a^3}$ the orbital frequency) of $\boldsymbol{r}$, we find for the instantaneous (unperturbed) orbital velocity $$ \boldsymbol{v}=v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}\cos\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{1-e\cos\eta} $$ where I have introduced $v_c\equiv\Omega a=\sqrt{GM/a}$, the speed of the circular orbit with semimajor axis $a$. From this, we find the radial velocity $v_r=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v}=v_c e\sin\eta(1-e\cos\eta)^{-1}$ and the rotational velocity $$ \boldsymbol{v}_t = v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}(\cos\eta-e)\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-(1-e^2)\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{(1-e\cos\eta)^2}. $$ With these, we have [corrected again] $$ \left\langle \frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}\right\rangle = \Omega v_c^2\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\, \frac{e(1-e^2)^{3/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta =\frac{\Omega v_c^2e}{2(1-e^2)}\hat{\boldsymbol{k}} \\ \left\langle \frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle = \Omega v_c^2\, \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\, \frac{e^2(1-e^2)^{1/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta(\cos\eta-e)}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta=0, $$ in particular, the components in direction $\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ average to zero. Thus [corrected again] $$\left\langle 2\frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}-\frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle =\frac{\Omega v_c^2e\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}}{(1-e^2)} $$ 

does that mean inflation occurred before the current laws of physics (read the four basic forces) precipitated, was c greater then than it is now? NO Already the very concept of an expansion velocity is flawed. Expansion means that elements of the medium move away from each other with a relative velocity that is proportional to their distance (for small distances). The constant of proportionality, the expansion rate, is the sensible concept here and has dimension of a frequency. Currently the universe expands at about 73km/s/Mpc, which is the smallest natural frequency known. At the epoch of infation, the expansion rate was just much larger. Of, course, over large sufficiently distances, any expansion results in superluminal velocities, but the laws of phyiscs only constrain the relative velocities of objects in close vicinity.
