What Buddha saying is beings are dependently originated due to ignorance. As far as we have self view we continue to accumulate Sankhara and we continue to exist. Sankhara is not the self but it is the accumulation due to self view. Beings are effected by kamma due to selfview. Once you eliminate self identificaton (Arahant) there is no more becoming or affected by the kamma. 

A letter from Mara. An interesting reading. $URL$ ======== Mara in Buddhism symbolizes the passions that overwhelm human beings as well as everything that hinders the arising of the wholesome roots and progress on the path of enlightenment. Mara is the lord of the sixth heaven of the desire realm and is often depicted with a hundred arms, riding on an elephant. According to legend, the Buddha Shakyamuni was attacked by Mara as he was striving for enlightenment, because Mara wanted to prevent him from showing men the way that liberates from suffering. Mara first called up a horde of demons, but Shakyamuni did not fear them. Then he sent his most beautiful daughter to seduce Shakyamuni, but before Shakyamuni's eyes she turned into an ugly hag, where upon Mara admitted conclusive defeat.* *The Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen 

If you have fever please consult a doctor and take medicine. I do not take a pain killer when I have pain. But I keep pain as my meditation object. I have taken painkillers less than twice in last three years. My experience without painkillers is shared in the following link. $URL$ 

There is relation between Anapanasati and four Satipathanas. ānāpānasati & the first satipaṭṭhāna "[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in... &... out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in... &... out calming the bodily processes: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. I tell you that this — the in-&-out breath — is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. $URL$ 

Personality view is seen things as internal (five aggregate) and external (five aggregate). You perceive internal as I,me and myself and external as not me, not mine and not myself. 

Ven. Ananda had the habit of asking Buddha the future destinations of people who passed away. So Buddha gave him the mirror of Dhamma so now you can decide this yourself. 

"So be it, O Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus, and stayed in Ambapali's grove. $URL$ 

Buddha never said that nihilism is better than eternalism. What he said was that people who take Rupa as self is more sensible than the people who take Nama as self because the mind is changing faster than the matter. 

During Vipassana, you will see the impermanence in all Sankhara. Seen impermanence in Jhana also an aspect of Vipassana. 

What is the difference between Dhithi (view) and Panna (wisdom)? According to Buddhism the teaching of other religions considered views. However, people who follow those religions think that they have wisdom. How can we differentiate views from wisdom? 

The answer depends on whether you are practicing Samatha or Vipassana meditation. Vipassana meditation has two aspects of knowing and developing. That is Samma Sati (right mindfulness) and Samma Vayama (right effort). 

First of all, you should learn to relax. I suggest that you practice some breath meditation. Then teach that to your significant other. 

Ayonisomanasikara (in appropriate attention) is the cause of anger. Practicing Brahama vihara is the antidote for anger. Contemplation on the Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta relate to anger is the way to avoid suffering from anger. 

The first step of removing Sankhara start when you become a Sotapanna. This is achieved by removing personality view. (Sakkaya Dithi) This processed has layers. Root condition. Buddhist training is directed towards eliminating the defilements (kilesaa). The foremost defilements are the three unwholesome roots — greed, hate, and delusion. From these spring others: conceit (maana), speculative views (di.t.thi), skeptical doubt (vicikicchaa), mental torpor (thiina), restlessness (uddhacca), shamelessness (ahirika), lack of moral fear or conscience (anottappa). These defilements function at three levels: Transgression (viitikkama) leading to evil bodily and verbal acts. This is checked by the practice of morality, observing the five precepts. Obsession (pariyu.t.thaana) when the defilements come to the conscious level and threaten to lead to transgression if not restrained by the practice of mindfulness. Latency (anusaya) where they remain as tendencies ready to surface through the impact of sensory stimuli. Security from the defilements can be obtained only by destroying the three roots — greed, hate and delusion — at the level of latency. This requires insight-wisdom (vipassanaa-paññaa), the decisive liberating factor in Buddhism. $URL$ 

The simple answer is "Yes" However, there are different weight in each Kamma. A person who tells a lie to protect his life has the least weight. It also depends on the person. Monks are expected to follow the precepts more vigorously than a lay person. See the current discussion on a similar subject. $URL$ 

Yes without going to the extremes existence and non-existence or eternalism and nihilism Buddha taught the middle path which is Dependent Origination. 

It is called the right knowledge and the right release. By following the Noble Eightfold Path the practitioner continually gains the knowledge and release on many levels. There are mainly four levels. (Sotapanna etc) But there are many intermediate levels hence it is called gradual training. Arahant is the final fruit of right knowledge and right release. 

Generally, we invite Sangha for a meal. After the meal, they chant some blessings. In Sri Lanka, we have overnight Pirith chanting in the new house. 

Buddha never talked about the beginning of the original consciousness (the first cause). Vinnana and Nama-rupa are dependently originated. 

You have to do this by stages while practicing Satipathana. Just practice breath meditation first. Then practice some walking meditation. It is gradual training. 

sampajañña: 'clarity of consciousness', clear comprehension. This term is frequently met with in combination with mindfulness (sati). In D. 22, M. 10 it is said: "Clearly conscious is he in going and coming, clearly conscious in looking forward and backward, clearly conscious in bending and stretching his body; clearly conscious in eating, drinking, chewing and tasting, clearly conscious in discharging excrement and urine; clearly conscious in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep and awakening; clearly conscious in speaking and keeping silent." - For a definition of the term sati-sampajañña, s. Pug. 86. $URL$ 

Buddha taught gradual training. There are many stages of happiness you can experience before you become a recluse. This is explained in Sutta such as many kinds of happiness. 

Sutta does not define that 'sati' as present moment awareness. Mindfulness in Buddhist teaching is much more than the english meaning of mindfulness and the the general mindfulness taught in the west. To understand the meaning of 'Sati' we should have a good understanding of the following two Suttas. $URL$ $URL$ 

In the following video this monk said that consuming alcohol is a latter addition to the fifth precept and hence not part of the Noble Eightfold Path. I wish to know your thoughts on this. $URL$ 

The way I understand the word Buddha has two different meanings. In conventional sense it refer to the present Buddha Gotama. In ultimate sense it refer the the quality of the Buddha,Arahant,past and future Buddhas or the Nibbana. I have similar question raised in DW. Who is the Buddha in Three refuges? $URL$ 

To me seeing things as they are means, practicing four Satipathana. You should contemplate on four Satipatthana in terms of Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta. 

It appears this practice originated from Taoism, not from Buddhism. However, there is an account of hungry ghosts stories in Buddhism. (Petavattu) In Sri Lanka, we pass merits to departed relatives but there is no specific date for it. 

This is the nature of life. Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta. First you have to accept these factors. Once you accept these,the only way you can go is up. Not Down. 

Modes of Production “What is it that is kamma-born, what cause-born, and what season-born? What is it that is none of these?” “All beings, O king are kamma-born. Fire, and all things growing out of seeds are cause-born. The earth, water and wind are season-born. Space and nibbàna exist independently of kamma, cause and season. Of nibbàna, O king, it cannot be said that it is perceptible by the five senses, but it is perceptible by the mind. The disciple whose mind is pure, and free from obstructions, can perceive nibbàna. 

"Im feeling very overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different things to remember and practice" "*****" No need to, that is why it is called gradual training. You take only one step at a time. In regard to four foundations of mindfulness you just practice the in and out breath until you master it.Then make an attempt to observe the five precepts. Then everything else will put in to place automatically. 

In Buddhism, it says that hunger, thirst, and reproduction as old habits. When craving (Tanha) for old habits they become new habits hence rebirth. 

Why Alaya Vinnana and Manas is not supported in Theravada? The objective of this question is not to criticise Mahayana teaching, but to compare and contrast the idea so we will have a better understanding of Theravada. $URL$ 

"'Everything exists': That is one extreme. 'Everything doesn't exist': That is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form. From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress & suffering. $URL$
