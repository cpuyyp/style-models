I'm no expert in glenohumeral anatomy, but I've noticed that if I do "triceps-style" bar dips, I have no pain nor impingement in the shoulder joint whatsoever. This is the version of dips where the elbow go as far back as possible, almost as if they're trying to touch one another, as opposed to "chest-style" bar dips, where the elbows are much more flared out to the sides. But, taking a look at the skeletal structures of the shoulder joint, I see no reason why moving the humerus "backwards", as opposed to just flaring it out to the sides, should somehow make the movement a lot more impingement-less (mainly across the AC joint, which seems to be the most likely source of impingement). Granted, a simple "skeletal/ligament" view may omitting some other important detail as well --- if my elbow is pointed backwards (with scapulae retracted), I can move the elbow upwards only so far (I cannot raise my elbow above my shoulder joint when it's pointed behind me, for example). So, are there actually other structures in place (e.g., muscle tissue) that could be keeping 'triceps' dips from hurting the shoulder joint? My best guess so far is just deltoids, traps, and the long triceps head simply all bumping into each other thereby blocking any pain-causing or impingement-causing ranges of motion. Edit: According to the image below, what exactly prevents sagittal shoulder extension a full 360°? Is it the stretching of the deltoids, or some occlusion between the rear muscle groups bumping into one another, or something else? Since whatever it is, it allows me to do triceps dips comfortably with no pain or impingement whatsoever. 

To race fast you have to run fast. Incorporate 3 things into your workouts: Track sessions Tempo/Threshold Runs Long runs - some of these should be HARD You need to buildup leg turnover. Getting on the track 3-4 times a month (maybe more if your body can handle it) will increase leg turnover. Tempos/Threshold - Do a variety of things here. Paced runs, runs where you cutdown from 7:00 to your goal marathon race pace for the last 3 miles, etc. will help callous your legs for the hard work in races. Do at least one hard run a month. If you run 7:00-7:30, try to build up to 16 miles where you average 6:30 pace or faster for the entire thing. Another key, vary the season. Maybe in the spring run shorter workouts but faster times. A few onths before the marathon season back off the intensity but do longer intervals. Jack Daniels is a valid system, but not the only one. You can use the old Oregon system as well. Key is to figure out what works best for you but the basic structure above should work best. 

The way some people do their pullups (there are many variations) can place some rather unique and interesting loads on the traps (even more so sometimes with an added weight belt). Your "pain" is most likely just some tendinitis of the tendon connecting the shoulder blade to the trap muscle. Make sure your traps are really solid and strong before attempting significant loads with pullups exercises. Your traps are here to stabilize the scapulae while you do your pullups --- and, as with many arm exercises, failure to stabilize the shoulder blades can have some pretty nasty consequences. Personally, farmer's walks and weighted vests are my goto for traps strengthening. 

You can generate hip problems from running in circles excessively. Many runners have leg-length issues, and many times it is the left leg that is 1/4" - 1/2" shorter than the right. If you constantly turn/pivot one the left this happens. This is usually a result of the pelvis becoming rotated over time, though knee cartilage can compress as well. I've been running on a track since I was 14 and my legs are different lengths as a result, though most of my issues are from a rotated pelvis - which according to my chiropractor is not rare among runners. I've seen many coaches instruct runners to run some workouts in the opposite direction on a track to prevent injury. Stress fractures in the lower leg are possible as well from constant turns in one direction. If the kid already has a bad leg length issues or hip rotation issues this could be a cause. However this is speculation... 

Almost every back anatomy diagram I see draws a giant trapezius muscle across the upper back. I work out frequently and I would say (for my body type/size) I have rather large "upper" traps, but have always wondered about the "lower" parts. It looks like they are always primarily mentioned in the context of scapular "depression". However, I have never "isolated" or purposefully tried to train "lower traps", nor do I feel any "weakness" when trying to depress my scapula manually or when doing exercises (such as weighted dips or pullups) that would make use of any scapular-depression musculature. In other words, I feel no "weakness" in my lower traps when doing exercises involving scapular depression or that seemingly would invoke lower traps for scapular depression or stabilization. So, are strong lower traps really that useful for most exercises? Do they need to be isolated, or are they pretty well invoked in any exercises involving traps anyway?  It seems to me like whatever weaknesses one may have in exercises -- such as dips and pullups -- that should make the most use of scapular depression musculature, the trapezius in general seems like the least likely muscle one would commonly need to strengthen in order to progress in those exercises. 

Yes, all spikes fit all track shoes (assume you are using track spikes), but the question isn't if tehy all fit, the question you should be asking is "what kind of spikes should I use in my track shoes?". If you are running distance or even middle distance you want short spikes. The actual size will vary, depending on your shoe. Some shoes have a recessed socket for the spikes, others have one that extrude from the bottom of the shoe. If the socket is recessed, you may want a pike that is 1/8" longer. Typically a D or MD shoe should only have a 1/8 - 1/4" spike. You're not running as fast and though you are on your toes it's not quite tha same as a sprinter. Still, as a sprinter you don't want long spikes. Longer spikes can cause you to catch your toe and send you head over heals. Javelin and Cross Country typically mandate longer spikes. The only thing you have to worry about spikes from a compatibility standpoint is the way you install the spikes. There are two different types of spike keys based on the types of spikes. Some are hex and others are a simple wedge. If you have both types of spike keys you do not have to worry about this. However the threads of the spikes will all be the same. 

Generally you'll have to put in enough intensity, volume, and time-under-tension to feel sore the next day. If you're just going light on these, then that's just a lightweight workout you can do everyday. Lots of people go out on a walk and/or a short run on a daily basis too -- it just depends on how hard your workout actually is! 

Sounds to me like you just have to increase the weight -- I mean, go even for sets of heavy singles with weight belt if you have to for that as well. The issue is not that pullups don't "target tht lats" -- they do, but lats are generally going to be the strongest muscles in that whole chain anyway. Since yours are strong enough already for bodyweight, it makes sense that you won't feel them being worked as much as the weaker muscles in that chain (such as elbow flexors and grip muscles in the arms). (The purpose of heavy singles is to workaround any weaknesses or lack of endurance in those weaker non-lat muscles). If, on the other hand, you're just seeking to do "more" pullups per set, then that will be more of an "endurance" (or technically, "time-under-tension") exercise. And consequently, those weaker muscles are really going to be hit hard going for that -- much more so than the already strong and stable lats. Edit: to be fair, assuming you're not talking about "kipping pullups, then some more time-under-tension handling would be critical here -- essentially to take the time to inhibit swinging and do pullups more strictly (kipping pullups limit time-under-tension to permit more reps).
