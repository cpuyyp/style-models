Which brings us to subliminal messaging. Subliminal messaging is useful for binding associations together. It's most often seen as part of propaganda campaigns. If you can associate your opponent with "crook" and yourself with "great", people are more likely to vote for you. But, if you just come out and say your opponent is a crook and you're great, everyone will just go, "Well, of course he'd say that. He's just a braggart trying to win votes." With subliminal messaging, the idea seems to originate within the target's head, so it is not examined as critically. This makes subliminal messaging useful in very specific circumstances. Remember: you can only create associations, and while you can sometimes use this to predict behavior (e.g., voting pattern), there will always be something outside your control that can change the outcome. For instance, subliminal messaging tends to be very fragile. As soon as someone has the thought, "Why do I think they're a crook?" they're leading down a path that will not just break the association, but assert it's opposite (assuming, upon investigation, the political opponent really isn't a crook). Creating a complex subliminal program... it's just not going to happen. First of all, you'd have to have exactly the right person, or they'll just reject your program out of hand. People all the time have thoughts float through their head that make them go, "Woah! Where did that come from? Better just forget I ever thought that." So, it's not just knowing everything about a person's brain, but the right person's brain. Assume you have the right person. You've (somehow) gotten a complete scan of their brain, and (somehow) know exactly what all their neural connections mean. Now you have to build a building. That takes months. Or, in the case of The Shining, decades? Centuries? That was an old house. That person you got a scan of their brain? That person doesn't exist anymore. Brains change constantly (that's basically what memory and learning is), and when we're talking about such delicate, error-prone system as subliminal programming, you would need a brain scan that is current at the time the program starts running. Okay, so, (somehow) you've got a scan of the brain at the time your program will start running. Good. Now you have to make sure your program activates in exactly the right way. If Jack gets a flat tire and is one hour later than you thought, everything's been for nothing, because the program won't run properly. If he gets dust in his eye at the wrong moment, and looks in a direction you weren't expecting, missing a piece of architecture you expected him to see, the program's ruined. If his family acts in an unexpected way, his program is ruined, so you better get scans and programs for them as well. And hope all their programs don't interfere with each other. At this point, I'd like to direct you to the Cthaeh, a villain in The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss. It can see into all possible futures, and chooses its own actions in such a way to bring about the worst possible future. Essentially, this is what you have to do. Forget neural connections and psychology; you need a way to look into the future. Then, you can iterate through your architectural design until you get a future that you want. 

As user @Hyfnae indicated in comments the low oxygen content is a problem. This short article explains why. Basically you need something between 19% and 23.5% for safety. You could probably dip to 16% if your colony spends most of it's time in sealed habitats or uses breathing apparatus normally. Atmospheric pressure at over twice Earth-average would seem a problem. I'm out of my depth here (no pun intended) but this is equivalent to I think being submerged at about 30 feet. Humans can do that for a while, but you're talking about living at that permanently. I'm also not sure what effect this has on how much oxygen content you need (increased pressure may compensate for the lack of oxygen). There's also the inert gas content, as I seem to recall there's a narcotic effect from inert gas use in diving (you really need to investigate aspects of diving and living in pressurized conditions to find out more). There's also the length of day. Human biofunctions are regulated by a thing called the Circadian rhythm. Now the normal day-light lighting cycle and the level of lighting both affect your body because it gets out of whack with the "designed-in" 24 hour cycle it expects. I'd be very surprised if anyone trying to live in a 30hr day would be able to - your body clock will be out of sync with the environment. If they try and live inside an artificially lit habitat that might work, but anything else would be like doing shift work that constantly changes the hours of work - it would quickly disrupt your sleep pattern (at a minimum) and you'd cease to function effectively. You'd become clinically depressed. So as it stands this planet could be colonized only by people living in closed habitats with life support (oxygen) and a completely artificial lighting system that mimicked the normal 24 hour day-night cycle. Note that even with this, if they needed to work outside for long periods they'd require not only life support (oxygen) but they would likely start to suffer depressive symptoms as their body clocks (24 hr cycle) would be out of sync with the planet's environment (30 hr cycle). 

The big problem with female warfare (for humans) is a fairly simple logic problem of breeding ability. Yes, there's selective pressures for men being generally stronger, but that's more of a result of the following than anything else; solve this problem, and the selective pressures move the other way. Say you have two tribes, each of 100 people, 50/50 men and women. Tribe 1 has male led warfare. Tribe 2 has female led warfare. The two tribes go to war. It's pretty nasty, and 80% of the warriors on each side die or are permanently incapacitated. Tribe 1: 10 men, 50 women Tribe 2: 50 men, 10 women You can probably see the problem already. The men in Tribe 1 can impregnate all 50 women. The men in Tribe 2 can only impregnate 10 women. Let's say relations between the two tribes cool down for 25 years, and each woman is able to successfully raise two kids to adulthood (on average, 1 boy, 1 girl). Tribe 1: 60 men, 100 women Tribe 2: 60 men, 20 women The war heats back up. Tribe 1 has 60 warriors. Tribe 2 has 20 warriors. Tribe 1 annihilates Tribe 2. Bees can have female soldiers because those females are reproductively expendable: they can't breed at all. Humans do not have that luxury. So how do we solve this? I'm not sure you can without significantly changing how humans work. In early societies, it was common for women to have 10-15 pregnancies and raise 5-10 surviving children. Given that a pregnancy takes you out of the action for at least 5 months, then (if the baby survives) you have to worry about feeding the baby for the next 5-12 months, 10 pregnancies is going to eat up the entire period of your life that you would be fit enough for warfare. Some possible ideas: 

Criminal punishment historically was violent and even lethal and yet we have always had crime. And as some criminals are actually sociopaths, they won't give an iota for what punishment happens other people (including their children). Have a look at Death Row sometime. They all knew the likely consequences. 

Survival problem ? Focus energies on solving the problem. This type survives. Survival problem ? Focus energies on calculating the odds of surviving. This type becomes extinct. 

I'm not at all clear how your creature can biologically create graphene. It's not a process I can see being produced in nature. My (limited) understanding is that graphene is brittle, especially when impure and is also prone to edge fracture (and somewhere there will be an edge). By comparison methods of imparting high impact, crushing, suffocation and so on are innumerable. Nothing special required. 

Critical combat operations (Normandy) Paratroopers/special operations behind enemy lines Deflecting German suspicion regarding Ultra/decrypting Enigma (How did 1,000 troops defeat 10,000 troops? They were paranoid and just happened to have their shields turned on before the "surprise" attack.) Propaganda: "With the new 64-10 PSG Personal Shield Generator (TM) in the hands of every single one of our soldiers victory is assured, and all our boys are coming home." Imagine the effects on morale both at home and among the enemy soldiers. 

It would basically be hyper puberty. You wake up feeling different and weird every day. Your body's changing in unexpected and confusing ways. Your hormones are going to go off the charts, shooting high into the air, then crashing down again. They'll be in constant pain as their body changes shape, down to their very bones. This person, no matter their start and end personalities, is going to be moody, overly-sensitive, and exhausted at all times during the transition period. They'll probably try and sleep at least 16 hours per day, and shovel food down the remaining eight hours. In all likelihood, this person is going to be extremely confused and embarrassed by what is happening, and try and hide it, shutting out friends and family. Violently, if necessary. If they don't live alone, they may flee into the wilderness while the change is happening. I mean, really, do you want to tell your husband that you grew a penis overnight? I didn't think so. 

Reality check won't be kind to this idea. The short version is that your planet killer requires handwavium and lots of it. 

Where did Mother Nature put all this intelligence ? While it's not agreed that there is a clear relationship between individual human brain size and human intelligence, it's almost certain that they'd need a brain of roughly comparable size (and function) to have comparable intelligence. If you pack a larger brain into their existing frame (expanding the skull as needed) you're going to create a creature which is completely unbalanced. It will cease to be able to fly, probably would be barely able to move. Where's the body to support the brain - by which I mean not just the mechanical support, but to supply it oxygen and other chemicals ? I'd be surprised if a falcon heart could pump enough blood to maintain a human sized brain or the lungs were capable of oxygenating blood quickly enough to cope with the flow required. It's completely unrealistic. 

Lakes are rivers are probably going to be mostly fine. Algae (despite being associated with the word "bloom") does not use pollen. Small creatures eat the algae, larger creatures eat those creatures. Ranching is pretty much done for. Without grasses, it's going to be far cheaper to ship in beef and wool/mutton from somewhere else. Chickens, on the other hand, will probably be the farm animal of choice. Continual food production (eggs) plus the occasional meat, and their diet is very adaptive. They can eat the scraps from the plants that humans won't eat (probably not potatoes; the plants are in the nightshade family), bugs, meat scraps, mice, etc.. Pigs might become a "status" animal. They take a lot of food before they're ready to eat, but the food they do eat can largely be scraps of what the humans are eating (or not even scraps). Ship in the seeds for most vegetables. Things like lettuce, cabbage, celery, carrots not only don't require going to seed, but are better if harvested before going to seed. This means you'll have to ship in 100% of your seeds (instead of letting some of your crop go to seed), but shipping in seed is a lot better than shipping in finished product (especially since finished product likes to rot). Ferns, moss, lichen, and fungus (mushrooms) are all plant/plant adjacent but do not flower or pollinate. Instead, they reproduce through spores. It might be nice to say, "And now we have a fern-based ecosystem," but remember that they all require substantial water and shade. Without a healthy forest system, they can't last long on their own, so take that into consideration. 

Tariffs beget tariffs. Meaning that if you impose a tariff on someone bringing goods into your economy, they will immediately impose a tariff on you bringing goods into there own. And tariffs will be changed in response to the whim of the people, even if that people was a single ruthless dictator. So this cannot remain constant either. Another answer said ... 

Yes, they are. Details of a practically minute nature are responsible for some of the bloodiest and most ruthlessly pursued wars in history. The devil is in the detail. 

Adoption. Okay, they aren't your genetic material in any direct sense, but any solution about castes is going to be about what's best for a community, not just your family. It could be advantageous to have some specialized in having many children, and then some of the children can be raised by the infertile caste. And, speaking of specialization... Community specialization. You've hit on this with your note about there being more men but they die more. In an environment extremely hazardous to your species as a whole, it could be advantageous to have a caste that sacrifices fertility in order to focus its energies elsewhere (defense, exploration, labor, etc.).
