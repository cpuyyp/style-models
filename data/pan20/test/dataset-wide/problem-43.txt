I've been playing a lot of Deserts of Kharak lately, and I am wondering if landships depicted in game, which are essentially seagoing ships on tracks, would work in a Snowball Earth scenario. By Snowball Earth, I am using the classic Snowball Earth scenario, where all of the oceans are frozen, and the equatorial regions have temperatures of around modern-day Antarctica. So would landships be a preferred method of transporting bulk cargo from one place to another in a snowball earth, say, compared to airlift? What challenges might a landship that runs on tracks or wheels might face on the glaciers other than structural issues of building such a titanic vehicle in the first place? 

What kinds of chemical warfare agents would be possible to synthesize and store (including binary ones, which are two precursors mixed during or immediately before firing) at an industrial scale with Napoleonic Era technology? Assuming the method of synthesizing the chemical agents are already known. Also, would Napoleonic artillery be capable of dispensing lethal chemical agents without killing the gun crews? 

The United States of America has 50 states and 14 territories (according to Google). In my story, each state is drawn far apart from each other due to conflicting interests. If all 50 states + 14 territories went to war against each other, which state would win? Conditions: I am talking about militaristic winning. The exact details, I'm not sure. I would prefer it to be conquering all other states, but I'm not sure if that is entirely possible. Time Period: Current Methods of fighting: Everything each state has, EXCEPT for nuclear war. So states with nuclear missiles would NOT have an advantage. Could you guys include specific details and facts? Thanks :D 

For structure 2, you say that you want a $900 km$ shell. I have absolutely no idea what you want inside it or how much it should weigh, so I am going to assume that it is an empty metal shell made of aluminum foil :). I'll make it approximately $1m$ thick which...if you want to know, would explode due to differences in air pressure in space. Note that this is all smaller than the actual measurements because I'm proving that it's going to take A LOT of energy. This would be a total of $$W = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h \cdot \rho \\= 450000m^2\cdot \pi\cdot 4\cdot 1m\cdot 2700kg/m^3 \\= 6870663133400878 kg \approx 10^{15} kg$$. 

In a world where torch ships sometimes will accelerate over 10Gs for hours, maybe sometimes days on end. Is there any way to keep the crew alive and preferably fully functional in during such harsh maneuvering, or do we have to result to handwaves such as "inertial dampening" or human augmentation? 

I am making the assumption that the AI allied with the defenders is a "strong" AI, and does not have any qualms about killing humans. A machine shop may very well churn out firearms, but you will need ammunition to feed them. Making a lot of AKs or Sten Guns definitely would be possible, assuming somehow they can get ammunition for them. Even if they lack ready ammunition, other weapons can be built to rapidly arm people. Because of the machine shop is in the town, machine out a very good spring and mount it to a stock and you have a cross bow, and other close-combat weapons can also be easily fabricated. Since this is a infrastructure development project, there is bound to be a lot of petrochemicals laying around. Hook a tank of combustible liquid or gas to a pressurized gas tank and you have yourself a flame thrower. Even better, if the AI has the proper formulae stored, explosives definitely would be a good option. A well-planted field of various mines and booby traps can hold up the attackers for quite some time. If the situation becomes desperate enough, you may consider synthesizing chemical weapons from the available raw stocks. Quite a few lethal and weaponizable chemicals can be produced from relatively simple ingredients, although this is not a recommended option, because of political backslash and the need to limit fratricide and collateral damage. Because the locals are untrained, I would rather not trust the battles to them. You have an AI, after all. If it is possible to manufacture electronics, I would recommend building and programming combat drones, slaved to the AI, to take out the attackers and gather intelligence. They can be as simple as quadcopters with a bomb strapped to it, or can be scaled up to remotely-piloted tankettes or AI-directed gun turrets. They can serve a further psychological blow to the sub-Saharan warlord, who may not be used to fighting unmanned combat systems. Even outside the battlefield, the AI could shine. Assuming the AI has sufficiently powerful backers, the AI can simply phone home to request things like satellite footage, or rally political sentiments to the defender's favor, which may allow further aid from outside. All and all, since the defenders have an AI on their side, they might as well as put it to good use. It is the age of information warfare, after all, and the AI is probably much more suited to modern war than the army of the warlord. 

Bullets A machine gun that fires rubber bullets at high speeds would be enough to stop organisms from physically boarding the ship, unless their armor is as strong as the ship's hull. If it isn't, just increase the mass or speed of the bullets. Nets and Rope: Or, if there are few organisms approaching your ship, like maybe one or two, Nets and Rope would work. Keep it like the old times :P Light Blinding light (which wouldn't damage the ship) could also be useful. Considering that the outer hull of the ship should be resistant to the sun's rays, you could mount a high intensity light ray gun on the outside, aimed to blast anything coming near. Worse case, it hits your own ship, but then again, your ship is resistant to the sun's rays. Magnets You have magnets? Okay then. Create an entry way into your ship that combatants must travel through. Possibly a tunnel or something of the sort. Cap the ends of the tunnel with very magnetic magnets. They come barging in? Release the magnets and squish 'em. How to prevent a Mutiny: You said that all personnel wear magnetic boots? Well, make the floor an electromagnet, and if your crew mutiny's, just turn on the electromagnet and poof, they're all stuck to the ground. Does this help? Any questions? 

We, the Hrimfaxi, an extensive interstellar empire, are invading the Earth! However, these pesky humans have proved themselves to be extremely good at pouring out dakka and making things go kaboom. Despite the technological advantages the we had during the first days of the invasion, they seemed to be adapting and dragging the ground war on and on. So why shouldn't I, the commander of the invasion just claim Earth a lost cause and declare Exterminatus? After all, Earth is just one small planet in the entire galaxy. Invading Forces: My space forces consists of a rather small flotilla of space ships armed with weapons on the equivalent of Earth's strategic nuclear weapons, enough to make Reagan and Gorbachev blush. I have a small shipyard in the solar system so I can procure more as I needed. My soldiers, on the other hand, are cloned, mindless drones, controlled by me through a psychic chain of command. Commanders like me have free will, while sub-commanders further down the chain have decreasing levels of free will. They are organized fairly conventionally: infantry, armor, artillery, air force, etc. I have cloning tanks at my disposal to replenish losses. Operational Objectives Standard expansion of Hrimfaxi sphere of influence and adding humans to the collective psychic network of Hrimfaxi systems. Secondary objectives include cataloging the genetic properties of life on earth, with is largely complete through abductions. The reasons are so buried underneath bureaucracy, ancient history, and indoctrination that most Hrimfaxi don't even know why they are invading other worlds other than they must or their superiors will have them executed. In fact, it is highly debatable if the higher spheres of the bureaucracy psychic network can be even fathomed under the mindset of an individual being.
