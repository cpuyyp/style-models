I'm not sure if this should really be an answer, but it was too long for a comment. Given a tennis ball mass of 57g, it is not the kinetic energy of 41 forehand winners. Given 184.5kWh you have enough energy to accelerate 41 tennis balls to a velocity of 53000 mph. It is also not the energy expended by the players in the match, as 1 kW is more than an athlete can output over an extended time, and the match can't have been going for hundreds of hours. 

I searched for "Hit Wicket shoe" and "Hit wicket Toupee", but couldn't find any reports, but they would of course also be covered by "any part of his clothing or equipment". 

The build-up Drago was down 41-65 with only blue, pink and black on the table. So he needed 6 points from snookers to be able to tie. He forced a snooker on the blue, moving back to 46-65, but still needing a snooker. Drago's next shot was a great safety behind the pink, and McManus was unable to make the shot, with a kiss on the pink leaving Drago only 52-65 down, and with enough points on the table to take the frame. Additionally, there was a free ball, as Drago didn't have a clear line to to both sides of the blue. The final shot Drago still has work to do, and needs to clear the table (pink as free shot, any colour, then blue, pink and black). So he plays the shot with a lot of pace to get position on the blue or black, but the pink rattles out of the pocket, leaving McManus with a relatively simple shot on the blue. The concession Drago walks towards McManus, says "Cheers, Alan", and offers him his hand, which McManus accepts. This is the accepted way to concede a snooker match. The realization The referee announces "Frame", and Drago says immediately "?????", causing the referee to ask "Do you want to withdraw the concession". I assume that Drago made a miscalculation, and thought at first that he needed to make the free ball and extra colour to be left without requiring snookers. But after checking the scoreboard he realizes that he is only down by 13 points, and that McManus needs to at least make the blue. The (non) retraction Drago considers his position and states something like "I don't know?? .... only down 15 points???", presumably pointing out his confusion, and that he only conceded due to making a mistake on the score. But when asked again he says that withdrawing the concession "wouldn't be fair to Alan". Drago wasn't prepared to go back on a handshake, even though he gave it under a misapprehension. McManus was asked if he was happy to accepted the concession, and he said "I am, absolutely", so Drago officially conceded the match. Getting to your questions 

The Texans were limited in what they could do in the 2015 draft regarding quarterback, having finished 2014 with a 9-7 record, giving them the 16th pick in the first round. They were one of several teams without a dependable quarterback, but were drafting for instance behind the Buccaneers (1), Titans (2), Redskins (5), Jets (6) and Browns (12), who all could have used a quarterback. The two highest-rated quarterbacks, Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota were gone in the first two picks, and trading up into one of the top 2 spots would have been very expensive, if not impossible. No other quarterback was drafted until the third round (Garrett Grayson by the Saints with pick 75) so it would not have crossed their minds to pick any other QB at nr. 16. But what about other offensive picks? The 20th overall pick Nelson Agholor (Eagles) was still available had they wanted. Obviously the Texans were in the market for a WR, as they picked Jaelen Strong in round 3 and Keith Mumphery in round 5. Why did they prefer to pick CB Kevin Johnson in round 1? This is a question that only the Texan's GM, coach, and scouts could really answer. The answers they gave the press are full of praise for their first-round pick, but of course we knew that already, as otherwise they wouldn't have taken him. Anyway, here are the quotes of the post first-round media interviews: GM Rick Smith: 

No, a batsman can only be out Stumped when the wicket is broken by the wicket-keeper, according to Law 39 (Stumped) 

In the recent U19 Women's match between England and Norway, the referee made a mistake in not allowing a penalty in added-time to be retaken after a player encroached. This is a clear misapplication of the laws. Instead of replaying the entire match with a new referee, or accepting the result, the solution was to replay the final 18 seconds of the match at a later date with the original players and a new referee. How was this decided, and when else could it happen? Was it special that it was a misunderstanding of the rules rather than a simple refereeing mistake, like not seeing the ball crossed the line? Would it be possible to replay a more significant part of the match (e.g the last 20 minutes)? 

As Nicholas V. points out, a player screening the goalie is usually in an offside position, and also active when a shot at goal is taken, so it is not a useful tactic in open play. The only times I've seen this done (at amateur level) are when a defender stands on the goal-line when defending a free kick. This means that an attacker can stand in front of the goalkeeper without being offside, and block his view of the ball. Of course the screening attacker has to be aware of the defender rushing off the line before the kick is taken, leaving him offside. There is some more information on this page about free kicks (in section Why Doesn't the Defending Team Put Players On the Goal Line?) 

As a close second: in 1997/1998, Manchester United were 11 points clear of Arsenal, both having played 22 games, but finished 1 point behind them. Here is the league table from 17 January 1998. 

Yes, in Germany you can take part in a summer version organized by the DSB (German Shooting Federation) that consists of running (in shoes) and shooting. Although this is the main variant, according to the rules: 

Looking at the rules page of the World Pool-Billiard Association, your understanding is right. For the break, Groups are not yet determined. 

The answer from Spinner, noting that "any part of his clothing or equipment" can cause a dismissal by Hit Wicket, is correct. I would just like to add a few examples of things that have actually fallen onto the batsman's wicket, causing the batsman to be out Hit Wicket. 

Quarterbacks are not more prone to injury. According to a Washington Post Article, a QB is injured once every 236 plays, while running backs and wide receivers are injured on average every 50-80 plays. Another way to measure the injury chance is the number of players on injured reserve: which also shows that being QB is one of the safer positions. Reasons why QBs are not injured as often as other players are 

The only sensible interpretation of this is that in regular season Team A would win for your scenario. Team B cannot get the ball because there can only be one 15-minute period, and the game cannot be a tie because the score is not tied. And as Dr.DrfbagIII pointed out in a comment, this would be the place to point out explicitly any extraordinary rules why 23-20 would magically turn into 23-23, and in the absence of such a rule we can assume that Team A wins 23-20. 

Team B will need to score 1 run in their second innings to win. If they are all dismissed for 0 runs (of course very unlikely), then the match is a tie. So they need to go out and bat to get that 1 run, at which point they will have won by 10 (or maybe 9, or 8...) wickets. Had team A scored only 99 in the second innings, then Team B would have won by an innings and 1 run, and had they scored 101, Team B would have to score 2 to win. There is now way to "win by exactly an innings". The case of runs being tied after the third innings has happened in five test matches, most recently between West Indies and India in 1983. None of the teams batting last had any difficulty in getting the required run to win the match. 

Unless you go into the stadium together, in the event of being caught in an ID Check, your friend would have no way of proving that he will be watching the match together with you. So the safest way would be to meet at an agreed place close to the stadium and go in to the stadium together. Assuming you are both going to be there in time for the kick-off, surely this is possible. 

This is possible, and has indeed happened (at least) once in a Test match, where the India Captain,Gundappa Viswanath, recalled the England Wicketkeeper Bob Taylor. 

If there is a match where both teams lost, then the match will not feature at all in the table. The only drawback is that this could mislead somebody as the total number of matches played between the teams. Possibly a footnote could be added "data excludes game from DD.MM.2005 where both teams lost due to crowd violence" The only other option I can think of would be to have four rows/columns: Team A Win / Team B Win / Draw / Other. But it would probably add much complexity just to cover one or two unusual cases. 

Let us ignore any practical difficulties in finding these values, and create a course where the average strokes remaining value appears by magic next to your ball after each shot - like this 

At half-time. A soccer match is split into two halfs of 45 minutes each, with a 15 minute break inbetween. An especially hungry and thirsty fan can buy food and drink before the match, consume it during the first half, relieve himself in the break, then repeat the procedure for the second half, at least in theory. In practice there may be queues for facilities, so this fan might opt to leave his seat just before half-time to beat the queues, or risk missing the start of the second half. You don't mention alcohol explicitly, but this is of course a big factor on input/output of fluids. Even where alcohol is not allowed in the stadium, fans may have been drinking before the match, and 45 minutes may be too long. In this case, the fan would just have to risk missing a couple of minutes of action to take a trip to the toilets. In older times, fans in England might have gone for direct method of relieving themselves, as detailed in 1989 by the Taylor report: 

As @red_devil226 pointed out, Newcastle United were 12 points clear of Manchester United in 1995/1996, both having played 23 games, but finished 3 points behind them. Here is the league table from 21 January 1996. 

But fortunately conditions have improved since then. If you want to maximise your food and drink intake, and have enough money (or contacts), you could choose to sit in a hospitality box, but risk the possibility of not being seen as a proper fan, and being more interested in prawn sandwiches than the team. In total, a football match is completed within 2 hours, with a short break in the middle. If the match is a decent one, then the action should be enough to entertain fans for 45 minutes at a stretch. 

If the slip fielder breaks the wicket with the batsman out of his ground, it is a Run out, as defined in Law 38 (Run Out) 

Because Henshaw caught the ball while it was in the air, the first contact did not cause a knock-on, and the try was correctly awarded. 

Long drive into the rough. Still 4.5 strokes needed. SG = -0.5 Good escape, but lands in the bunker. 3.5 strokes needed. SG = 0 Amazing bunker shot, to within 8 feet. Now only 1.5 strokes needed. SG = 1 

Coming from Rugby football, you've got at least a head start compared to someone completely new to team sports. A couple of things you can take with you are 

At least four other players have achieved and surpassed this, by scoring 100 runs and taking 10 wickets in a match. Of course to score 100 runs in a match, you need to score at least one half-century. 

Using your example it looks as thought the definition is simply: Conversion Rate = Goals scored / Total shots From the information that in 2014/2015 Diego Costa had 2.9 Shots per game in 26 games, we know that he had a total of 75 or 76 shots over the season (both 75/26 and 76/26 round to 2.9 when 1 decimal place is used). He scored 20 goals, and using the value of 76 shots the conversion rate is 20/76 = 26.3% This irish sports site uses the definition percentage shots scored for conversion rate, which supports the above definition. 

This scenario occurred in a 2014 match in the french Ligue 1. Paul-Georges Ntep scored a goal for Rennes against Reims with a header after dribbling up to the empty goal. On this occasion at least, the referee let the goal stand. Herman Koré repeated the feat in the French cup , according to google translate: 

Usually a Hat-Trick is an informal term, and can be defined by whoever is speaking/writing. So if it was a team-mate you might go for humour and say "Our Striker scored a hat-trick .... but unfortunately one was at the wrong end". And a journalist might call it "an imperfect hat-trick" , or a special hat-trick, or a hat-trick by majority verdict, or a hat-trick of sorts, or whatever they feel best fits. But if this term ever needs to be defined in an official way, maybe as part of a sponsor's prize, or for betting, then I'm sure the answer will be no. For example, the betting exchange Betfair defines it like this: 

but the more telling explanation was from the BBC cricket expert and former fast bowler Jonathan Agnew: 

No, 100 is not the limit, because there is no maximum average. The batting average is calculated as: 

I have played as a defender against some very frustrating strikers with larger frames. The good ones lean back a bit, expecting some contact, and concentrate on shielding the ball. They don't let a small push from the defender's body disturb their play, and know that an obvious shove in their back using both hands will result in a free kick. Try practising the scenario with a teammate, and get used to adjusting your balance to counteract his pushing from behind. Unless he is much stronger than you, with some practise you should be able to keep your balance and the ball. A push in the back is unlikely to make you fall, and throwing yourself to the ground will convince nobody, especially if the defender is smaller than you. I don't think anyone would ever see pushing as reckless or dangerous, but repeated foul play by a defender could result in a yellow card. Remember that you are (literally) the bigger guy here, and are more than capable of pushing back (legally), so just accept it as part of the game and concentrate on winning the bigger battles. If you keep possession, and pass to a teammate then it is a small win for you. If you are able to use the aggressiveness of the defender in your favour and spin past him, it is a big win for you. If you frustrate the defender into an obvious foul, again a win for you.
