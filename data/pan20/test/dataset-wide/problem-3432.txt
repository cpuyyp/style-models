Yes, however a supply shift as a result of interest rates can be (sticky).this is why after a stock drop, a recession can take 1 year- 18 months to occur. So when we look at economic indicators over the past year, the 10-year approaching 3% has not led to a reduction in aggregate supply. It may not be until FY 18 Q4 that we see a drop a significant drop in in supply. Supply and interest rates do not have a “flexible” relationship, but instead a “sticky” one in which supply may not drop immediately, but over time your answer is correct. 

Constant returns to scale simply means that if K and L are increases by 10%, Y will also be increases by 10%. Y will never be increases by more than F(K, L), so profit for additional labor is not possible in that simplified model. I’m assuming this textbook could be Macroeconomics by Mankiw because this concept looks familiar? So Fk and FL would increase by the same % and your output (Y) increases by the same percentage in a constant returns to scale model. 

There’s an argument in modern economic theory (Macroeconomics Mankiw 5th edition) that a society is only as wealthy as its GDP, or the goods and services within the economy, adjusted for inflation (not nominal GDP). This would highlight if we use deductive logic that our trade agreements with Germany, AND France were not good agreements because the Trade was one sided (not a mutual flow). They produce a car for example, we produce nothing. Modern economic theory teaches us that society faces a trade off between production and consumption. Consume a lot now, consume much less later, because you must produce to increase your future consumption. All of this is relevant to your question because trade agreements with China AND Germany led to a similar issue. The United States consumed and did not produce proportionately (severe trade imbalances). For a while it feels good to produce without consuming (Mankiw uses an illustration of an economy that can produce robots or pizza’s), but as you can see, the lack of production leaves you with no resources over time to increase consumption. Real GDP is higher in the long-run if you produce at an accelerated rate, than if you consume without an increase in production. The real world result is that you’d expect the exact outcome that we got from “free trade” with China. They can simply produce cheaper and more goods, we don’t produce as much or as efficiently, and the outcome is what we see today if we follow modern (college) economic theory. 

There are still a number of car makers, so at this point it is NOT a monopolistic sector. Barriers to entry are also reduced globally (Asia) due to a decrease in the cost to make a car. I do understand your point on new software, however, the cost of vehicles with the newest and best software is still high to the extent that there is a semi competitive market for individuals who can't afford the newest software. At this point, we an oligopoly. Even if you consider new electric vehicles, multiple players (BMW, AUDI, GM, obviously TESLA, and some Asian companies) are even getting into that market, and the costs are sky high. As costs fall, you will see a scenario in which the marginal cost to entering the market will begin to come closer to the marginal benefit, which will lead more players into the market, which is what happened post model T. It is a similar scenario, just with 21st century technology. The economics are the same. Instead of the model t, we have teslas model s coming, but just like with the model t, we could predict that the market will become more saturated, resembling more of an oligopoly. Google, Microsoft, and Apple are not comparable in that regard. I can only do so many things with a MAC until I HAVE TO GET a Microsoft (as a programmer). However, a car is a car. Slightly different software won't give you a monopoly, because of how individuals use software, compared to how individuals use a vehicle. There are relative substitutes to a model S. There is no substitute to C# with Microsoft if I have to use C#. There is no substitute to SWIFT on IOS if I HAVE TO USE Swift. 

I know that this is called price “stickiness”. Price “flexibility” is when something such as interest rates would bring prices to equilibrium quickly. Price stickiness in this case could have a delayed effect as you mentioned. We could also call this “elasticity”. For simple models rise over run can measure price elasticity. For example, a 5% change in interest rates, and it’s corresponding impact on prices could be measured by slope (rise/run). 

Yes, that may be a long-term pattern, unless their is a fear of inflation, or a slowdown in the economy. For example, if investors have fear that the rise in interest rates could actually lead to an economic slow-down, the currency can decrease in value in the short-term. As you know, rising interest rates are recessionary in theory (and slow the increase in M2 in many cases). If traders have fear that they rise in interest rates will cause the economy to slow, and are concerned that a central bank may respond to the slowdown by issuing more currency in the future, they may become short-term sellers of the currency. Another issue is trading. Look at the stock market today. In order for foreigners to trade they must use US dollars. This increases the demand for dollars. However, if there is fear of a stock market decline, that will decrease the demand for dollars in the short-term, and in the short-term can lead to a falling stock market. 

They are interconnected. For example, disruption could lead to deflation, because someone (such as Amazon) can come into the market and sell goods at a lower cost, while increases the quantity of goods. This could grow real GDP (in terms of economic output), while decreasing nominal GDP when adjusting for the deflator (hypothetical scenario). Economics growth can also lead to nominal price inflation (connection), as more goods and services are sold throughout the economy. Economic growth can also occur with disruption (connection), if the disrupting firms are more efficient in terms of economic output. This would simply increase societies production possibilities frontier. 

This means that as the quantity demanded for an inferior good falls as the price falls. An example of this is a good that is deemed to be “bad” if the price is bad. Consider a shirt at walmart that the public views as “cheap”. As the price for that good falls individuals expect that good to be worse and demand falls. Ordinarily with normal good the demand would rise as the price falls, but with a normal good the demand curve simply slopes downward as the price falls. Graphically you can display this pattern with a supply and demand curve. Normally you would see the demand curve slope upward as price falls, but in the case of an inferior good you can simply show it graphically by having the demand curve slope downward as the price falls. 

It varies. Importing a pool of labor, if we are to consider labor costs can have an impact if the migrants are willing to take lower wages. We know that R(revenue) = (MPK + MPL) * Price, which simply means the marginal product of capital + the marginal product of labor times price equals a firms revenue. Let’s assume that the additional labor will take lower wages. That can reduce a firms labor cost which is L * W (Labor quantity * wages). As labor costs decrease a firms profit can increase if revenue remains the same. This increase in Revenue leads to higher savings, which leads to budget surpluses. Capitals share of Income will grow. So we know that firms and the owners of capital (typically shareholders) benefit. The consumers are either unharmed, or get lower prices if the firm can reduce prices due to the lower Labor costs. So you may ask “who’s hurt?”. Well in the short-run the people who lost their jobs to the migrants who were likely to take lower wages for low skilled labor (based on ethnic wage rates) were hurt. Essentially, you’d expect owners of capital to prefer migrants, and for workers (labor) in the impacted sector where the migrants flow to hate it. So to answer your question (is it actually bad for the countries economy), no. Not in it of itself. GDP would be expected to grow in real terms (output), or not be impacted much at all. You could end up with increased profits and savings as well, which can lead to a savings surplus. Now whether or not there are certain individuals who are negatively impacted is another question. 

Yes, that is correct. In an oligopoly there are many buyers and few sellers, so buyers are more passive when it comes to prices. The few suppliers can also engage in price discrimination because there are many buyers with a higher demand level for a given good. However, you are correct in that what you described is a bilateral oligopoly. You can relate this to the fact that the few buyers have NEGOTIATING POWER. For example, Boeing is a large purchaser of jet engines, so they do have negotiating power over the three major jet engine suppliers because they are one of the few consumers in the market place. That’s how I personally relate the idea and commit it to memory. 

Based on modern macroeconomic theory a country does not have to run deficits, but often chooses to. From a Macroeconomic perspective, a country runs a deficit when G is greater than T (Government purchases outweighs Tax revenue). This is not limited to the public sector (Government), but private individuals can also run deficits when consumption outweighs private savings such as in the United States. When a country has both private and public deficits we call these “twin” deficits, such as in countries like the United States. In theory a country can run a surplus or a deficit, so to answer your question “no a country does not have to run a deficit”. A country can increase savings, reduce investment, and have positive NX (net exports). Of course, the reduction in investment means less consumption in the short-term, which is not politically desirable. The impact of public and private deficits is theoretically less consumption in the future. This is why economists call running large deficits “borrowing from the future.” At some point, the money borrowed to finance the deficit must be paid back, which will reduce future consumption, raise interest rates, and force more savings. Another impact of deficits is a crowding out effect if the government is running the deficit. This decreases savings, which decreases the pool of savings for private parties to borrow. A surplus on the other hand can lead to an increased pool of savings that can be drawn down upon in the future for consumption. 

Net capital outflows from the US would increase. Net capital inflows for the foreign country (investment) would increase. This keeps the accounting equation equal. For the US S-I would increase, thus creating a balance of trade surpluse (even though these are financial assets). For the country receiving the inflow S-I (savings-investment) would decrease, increasing their deficit (assuming the balance of trade began equal). This balances both sides of the trade. Our net capital outflows grow by an equal amount to their net capital inflows in this situation. 

We will donate production as y (output), labor as l (workers), and wages as w (compensation). In your example l (labor) is reduced from 12 to 10 which is a sign that productivity is improving because you say that y (output) remains constant. What can we expect? Well (n) decreases and output remains the same, profit increases (profit = (MPL * Price) - w). So the marginal product of labor increases, output stays constant, but wages remain constant in your example. This means that each worker is marginally more productive due to fewer workers (l) producing the same level out output (y), which increases profit. The modernization will be called technology and we can denote it as (k) for capital. The workday should also remain constant because the hours worked is offset by fewer workers (there is missing information in this question so this may not be precise). MPK (the marginal product of capital) is unknown in this problem however, which means the revenue from changes in capital, and the profit as a result of capital is unknown because we don’t know what r (the cost of capital, rent paid for machines) is. So it’s an incomplete question it appears. In short, based on what you did ask, labor productivity per worker should increase, and work day duration should remain the same because the tech increase appears to be offset by fewer workers, which is why aggregate production (y fixed) remains the same, so we can expect hours to remain the same per worker, although aggregate hours worked fall. 

The government does this currently. They can essentially print money, put it into the real economy, and then borrow it back from individuals who buy bonds. The issue is when individuals do not want to buy bonds (for one reason or another). Then you end up with excess money in the money supply, leading to an inflation crisis. Currently, the US can get away with this because there is high demand for US treasuries, AND that also creates a scenario in which there is high foreign demand for US dollars. That demand raises the currencies value, and thus restricts inflation. When you think about the cycle of money however, a government prints money, spends it, you and I eventually see that money in some form, and then we are taxed or buy bonds. An illustration of this is if a man named Sam (uncle Sam) goes up to Jane (a citizen) and offers to give her money. He does, and she spends it. Sam gave other people money, and they spend it, so Jane's wages can be a combination of what Sam gave her, and a combination of what Sam gave other people. When Sam needs more money he taxes her. This is essentially interest free. When Sam wants to spend more, he issues bonds, which in essence lowers the money supply in the economy until the money is injected back into the economy. Hopefully sams payments to Jane made her and others more productive, because the increase in the quantity of goods (supply) can offset the inflation (money supply expansion) that Sam has created. 

Yes. It’s economically feasible because we have to consider where money comes from. The central bank can essentially create money out of thin air and buy back bonds. Or, banks can create more loans and increase bank deposits which can control the money supply. The government can then raise revenue from taxes, or borrowing. In theory the government can issue a basic income from the taxes it collects, based on the money supply that the federal reserve and central bank can manipulate. Y = GDP, I = Investment, C = Consumption, G = Government spending If GDP is Y = (C + I + G) Now, disposable income is Y - T (taxes). And public savings is T - G. And private savings is Disposible income - Consumotion. As you can see, if savings are sufficient, the government can issue transfer payments (in this case a basic income) to its citizens. You may ask “what if a country doesn’t have enough savings for the basic income?”. That’s where borrowing money comes in. If savings are insufficient, the government can borrow more money, increase the deficit, and still issue a transfer payment to each citizen for a basic income. The effects of either policy may or may not be bad. That is more of a normative statement. I’m simply illustrating through this model that it is “feasible”.
