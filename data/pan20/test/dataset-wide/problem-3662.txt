There is a concept called the "anabolic window", which is a belief that directly after a workout our body is primed for optimal muscle protein synthesis (muscle growth) and that this period lasts only a short while, with anything after that far less effective. When I say a short while, I mean on the scale of half an hour or so. There is however no sufficient scientific support for the idea that there is indeed such a window, rather than a prolonged period of increased muscle protein synthesis that gradually decreases back to base level over the course of days after a workout. One of the reasons for this belief is that strength training causes some muscle damage, and as such muscle protein breakdown. To immediately counter the effects of this and prevent further breakdown, it is suggested that some protein, and carbohydrates to elevate insulin levels (of benefit to muscle protein synthesis) is consumed immediately after a workout. As stated before, the evidence doesn't seem to support this logic, and the breakdown is in fact greatly exaggerated in the minds of those who believe that nutrient timing plays such a large role. Breakdown may be greater, however, when training fasted; for example, when training first thing in the morning after a night's sleep and without breakfast. In that case it may be of some use to consume some protein and carbohydrates sooner after a workout. For reasons such as this, the term "peri-workout nutrition" has started popping up, to indicate that the nutrition surrounding a workout is of more importance than simply post-workout or pre-workout. So if the anabolic window theory is disregarded, the question then is how long after a workout an increased protein intake is actually useful, and from what point on it only really serves to add calories and could be lowered. Going by a number of sources, you'll find that the consensus is something like this: muscle protein synthesis increases fairly rapidly after a workout (a time frame of hours), remains well elevated for around 24 hours and gradually tapers down. However, it may still be elevated above baseline for as long as 48 hours or more. Practically speaking, if you train 3 times per week or more, you'll benefit from keeping protein intake high throughout the entire week. Even during periods with less or no additional muscle protein synthesis a high protein intake would be useful for those who do strength training or aim for a better physique. Sufficient protein will limit muscle breakdown. Protein also has the highest thermic effect of the three macronutrients, making it useful for satiety while trying to limit weight gain. The conclusions are that increased protein intake will be useful for at least 2 days after training, that with a training regime of 3 or more sessions per week there's little point in varying protein intakes over the course of that week, and that it's useful to make sure you've got sufficient glycogen stored through carbohydrate intake in day leading up to a workout. Alan Albert Aragon and Brad Jon Schoenfeld did an nice review of related scientific literature in this article: $URL$ It can be useful if you want to dig deeper into the available information. 

I think you should c) not do something you aren't ready for. Sorry to be a bummer, but unless you've worked up to a level where a 120 km bicycle race seems like a fair challenge that might be difficult but not too far outside of your comfort zone, trying to force it seems like setting yourself up for either disappointment, injury or a very long recovery afterwards (or combination thereof). If you can do option a, you should. But you'd probably know. If you can't you're just burning yourself out to the point where you'll hit a physical limit. Option b seems more realistic, but again only if you an. Even if it takes you ages or you'd finish last, if your goal is to get that 120 km, that's what matters. But if you did 100 km and the last 20 km were disproportionally hard, 120 km just doesn't seem like a good idea. No short-term plan is going to to fix that. Set it as a goal for the future and train until some next race. I don't wanna discourage you if there is a chance you'll make it, but excessive overreaching only ever seems to result in injuries or otherwise bad stuff. It's a fine line between pushing yourself for consistent progress while showing tenacity, and going overboard. 

Making and correcting entries General considerations Where possible, utilize grams. Metric units are easier for conversions and calculating serving sizes. Furthermore, MFP lists nutrients in grams and milligrams, so basing yourself on grams just gives an overall better picture of what you're getting. If the values for a certain nutrient are unknown, leave it blank. I see people filling these in with 0's, but the message you're sending is different. If a food lists fats and tells you how many of those are saturated, that doesn't tell you how many are poly- and monounsaturated. Stating these are 0 is probably incorrect. Leaving the fields blank says "I don't know". Go with the information on a food label if there is any. Even for whole foods, where generic entries may be found, it pays to use specific values for a specific product of a brand if these are listed on the packaging. If information is lacking, sometimes a brand's website can provide it. Don't go taking values out of other user-submitted entries on other sites and applications such as FatSecret, because these are just as vulnerable to incorrect information. This would only make things worse, because now people see these values in multiple places and assume they must be correct. For whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and more, use information from well-estabished databases such as the USDA. An excellent reference database is that of $URL$ which provides info for various serving sizes, always including 100 grams (see further) and plenty of other info such as micronutrients. Finally, note that sometimes for the same brand and product, values can be different per country based on local production or legislation. If so, it may be best to make a separate entry with the country mentioned after the brand name or product name. Serving size & servings per container If possible, provide a serving size of 100 grams. This is the easiest to work with. If a different unit is used, always prefer weight units. I see things such as "1 cup". This is simply not accurate. For a liquid it is hard to measure exactly one cup, since it may be filled until the surface is slightly above the cup edge or right below. For flour, 1 cup can be very different depending on how finely it was milled and how densely you pack the cup. This can make for a difference of up to serveral dozens of kilocalories, which may not seem much but adds up over the days and weeks. Serving sizes of "1 slice" for things like bread are completely useless because there can be too much variation. There's no proper standards there, and even if there were it is unlikely a user cared to find out. If they did, they'd have bothered to use weight. If a serving size is given on a label using a different measure (for example, 125 grams) it's still better to do the conversion for each nutrient and list the 100 gram values. You just multiply everything by 100 g/x g where x is the listed serving in grams. So if for example values are given for 125 grams, just divide everything by 1.25. Your computer's calculator app is your friend. I'll state the reason for this below. Servings per container can be given as stated on the container, but I'd suggest just keeping this at 1. You may find a pasta sauce that comes in containers of 250 grams and 500 grams. If someone can't figure out that 250 grams is 2.5 servings of 100 grams they are beyond your help anyway. Besides, these aren't always accurate. I frequently buy jars of 500 grams of yoghurt but when measuring I manage to scrape out at most 490 grams because some always stays behind in the container and some water content may have evaporated. When getting oven baguettes I've found that they list the weight for one as 125 grams but in practice they end up weighing a little more. A company would rather give you a bit too much than risk getting sued for not providing what they sell. So don't just go by what's on the packaging, weigh your food. This is the reason why providing values for 100 grams is preferable, because it lets you state the measured serving yourself without too much math involved. Calories These are kilocalories. The biggest mistake here is people stating a certain serving size, but then using the kilocalorie value from a different serving size. For example, they state serving size is 100 grams (good) but then mistakenly read the kilocalorie value on a label that gives it for, say, 70 grams (bad, you've now underestimated your calorie intake). Another thing to look out for is kilojoules. Some labels state values in both kilocalories and kilojoules. Don't mix these up. If a label provides only kilojoules (yes, I've had this happen) multiply that value by 0.239 to get the kilocalorie value. Fats What you'll usually find on a label is "fats" and then "of which saturated". If no information is provided regarding exactly how much is poly- and monounsaturated, or trans fats, don't fill in anything for those fields. Stick to fats (most important) and saturated (may be important for some people), only providing the other types if they are properly listed. Cholesterol Pay attention to the fact that this field is listed in milligrams. Since there's no distinction between various types of cholesterol, and the relation between dietary and blood cholesterol has come under scrutiny, I'll admit I usually don't pay much attention to this field. Sodium Important note: one of the most common sources of mistakes Sodium is a chemical element with chemical notation Na (from "natrium"). Salt is a molecule consisting of a sodium cation (Na+) and chloride anion (Cl-). Its chemical notation is NaCl. The sodium cation makes up about 40% of the molecular weight. This is not exact but close enough for all practical purposes. Sodium and salt are not synonyms. Salt will often be the main source of sodium in food, but it is not always the only source. What you're supposed to provide in MFP is the sodium content. Whether a label lists sodium or salt varies, and what it is obliged to list can depend on jurisdiction. It can be different in various countries. If a label lists sodium content, use that. If a label lists only salt content, multiply it with 0.4 to get sodium content. Note that if sodium content is listed, you'll know exactly how much sodium is in there, but if salt is listed you've only got a lower limit for the sodium. There could be other sources of sodium than the salt. But if it's all you have to go on, then it's better than nothing. Again and again I see entries where the salt content on the label is listed as sodium, which will give a gross overestimate. I'll repeat, sodium is 40% of salt. Also keep in mind that sodium is listed in milligrams, not grams. So if you are given sodium content in grams, multiply by 1000 to get the the milligrams. If you get salt content in grams, multiply by 400 to get sodium in milligrams (this is effectively x 1000 x 0.4). I've seen people just literally copying what's on a label. So a label stated "1.9 grams salt" and they put 1.9 in the sodium field, meaning they failed to both convert to milligrams AND realize sodium and salt aren't the same thing. I'll give an example: if the label says 1.9 grams salt, that means it has 1900 milligrams of salt, and that in turn means you get 0.4 x 1900 milligrams of sodium, = 760 mg. THAT is what goes into the field in your MFP entry. Sodium intake is important for some people so pay attention to getting this right for their sake. Carbs Important note: one of the most common sources of mistakes Carbs consist of sugars, fiber and starches, amongst possibly some other things. You'll usually find entries for total carbs, sugars and fiber on a food label. Now here's one of the main sources of confusion: this is different in the US and Europe (and around the world). A US label would look like this:
