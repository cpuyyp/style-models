I am working in IT industry as a Sr developer. Recently there has been a change in my project and my project lead has been changed and now I am to report and work with this new lead. During last few weeks I have found that my view points are not compatible with his. For example, if working on a new design he propose changes which I do not agree with. Also I have tried to cross verify my views with another experienced person on project who not working on my module and found that I was correct at most of the places. Now the problem is I am the only one to work with this new lead, and rest of Sr leadership is not directly involved in the project and are onsite. I am not sure how do I deal with situation. 

I'm a Canadian student (going to the University of Waterloo) and having gotten a J-1 visa (and potentially looking to get another) I can share some of what I know. If I am correct you need a sponsor, when I got my J-1 I was sponsored by Cultural Vistas and I know that Intrax and SWAP are others (and I'm sure there are more). You do not work for the sponsor, they just make sure the application and job are good to go. Each sponsor has different requirements and fees, here is the intrax page with some info and here is the Cultral Vistas one. Looking at the Cultral Vistas page 

As someone who has actually had my appendix rupture (and spent a week in hospital for it) and is currently working at a co-op job (although not at the same time), I think they are most likely better to take the time off. When I had my appendectomy, I spent a week in hospital, lost significant weight and could barley walk. While the student might be better off than I was, I can't imagine that they would be comfortable while working full time hours. Afterwords I was taking strong antibiotics for a week or two and those would just wipe you out, while lifting things would be out of the question, even sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours straight doesn't sound appealing. Ultimately there are a couple key factors, how do they feel and will both parties take away anything meaningful. Only the student can answer the first question, so emailing them to ask them how they feel and whether they would like to come back to work would answer the first part. Using this information (or going off my experiences) and looking at the job, will the student and the employer benefit from them coming back for a week or so? I don't know they full details of the co-op or of the students condition, so the answer might be yes, but they will have to be the judge. 

I happened to face similar situation. I was working with an organization which I liked a lot. Then due to some personal reasons, I had to leave it and I did not leave with a very good impression. Then after 1.5 year I tried to join back. I cleared the interview but the HR got not so good feedback about me from my previous supervisor and I could not join. However, the organization had a rule that the previous supervisor's feedback will be taken/considered only if the employee is joining back with 2 years. So I tried again after 3 years. This time I cleared the interview and luckily it did not go to that supervisor for feedback. They looked at the old record of the type of work I had done earlier which was good in my case. I am now working there again. So my point is, if you had done good work there earlier, but made a bad impression only when you were leaving, you can ask them to consider your earlier work. Also you can show the type of work you have been doing after leaving which can show that you have improved since you left. Hope this would be of some help. 

There is a manager (not my manager) who sits across from me and since we both have open cubicles I can easily see (if I turn) and hear what he is doing. Perhaps I should phrase it differently, it is difficult to not hear what he is talking about. At any rate, he has small meetings at his desk a semi-frequently which I get the privilege of have no choice in listening to. A few time I have overheard them talking about something I have a very good understanding of (such as our current migration to Git) which they are confused about and I just turned around in my chair and provided my input. It has been a kind of instinctual thing and they seem appreciative, but it occurs to me that this might be rude and intrusive. As I mentioned, I don't really have a choice in listening to these meetings, they are 2 feet from my desk and are not easily ignored. The manager and I are on good terms, if we weren't I would not be doing this. So am I being impolite or helpful by interjecting in these meetings? What is best course of action? I really have no idea what the best option is here, I get the feeling I should bite my tongue and keep silent, but I feel bad by wasting other peoples time by not helping. Additionally I can't move away from the meeting, I have a desktop computer and I am a software dev. I could ask him to hold his meetings in an actual meeting room, it would disturb me a lot less, but that seems unlikely to work since we don't have computers in most of the meeting rooms. Ps. I know listening into meetings is bad to do, I'm not trying to (I'm also not asking if it is bad)... Additionally there is nothing sensitive covered in these meetings, he would find an actual meeting room for that. 

I am placed in a new software project along with another colleague who happens to be one level up in hierarchy. We both are on the project for around a month now. As both of us are new to the project we both have to create visibility and make a place for ourselves in the project. So this makes it a competing environment for us. Our bosses are working from different geographical location and has suggested him to be my supervisor. During this month I have observed that he keeps some knowledge sharing meetings with stakeholders and keep me out of loop. Also he has 1-1 conversation with onsite bosses over mail or phone frequently. I am not able to discuss these things with him as he is my supervisor as well. Can this be harmful for me in long term? What should be done to avoid problems? 

If it feels like you have gone out of your way to become part of someone's personal conversation I wouldn't, especially if the conversation is between just two people. However if a personal statement has been said out loud, openly and to more than one person then it's the perfect opportunity to get involved!! Don't overtink it though.. we're all human and like to talk about our lives outside of work and I think people will respond positively if you show an interest in them 

You need to try an look at this situation objectively. You haven't specified the role that you applied for, i.e. was it a trainee software engineer/support specialist or was the role advertised as an experienced engineer. Either way communication is key, but explaining that you are not happy because of X isn't necessarily the best way to handle things. instead try putting half an hour of your own time in to writing a handover/update of your day to your employer. It may go something like this; Today I have spoken to X customers, of which I was able help X I spent longer than I should have with customer X as I wasn't sure on what to do, after researching/contacting/asking for help I come to the conclusion X. I definitely think there is in an opportunity for me to gain a deeper understanding around X issue, please could you advise the best way for me to get this information. I also have X projects which I need to start and have customers waiting for however due to X time researching/contacting/asking for help today I was unable to start today. I'm starting to worry that I am falling behind with these projects, please could you advise on what YOU think I should do. 

I have been told a number of times that it is important to list some soft skills on your resume especially since, as a software developer, it is really easy to fill all the space with hard skills. While I do have soft skills I think I could list, I always feel kind of silly listing thing like 'strong leadership' because it feels like anyone can say that and everybody does! Is it as important a people have been telling me to list 'soft skills'? If so is there any way to list them to make them seem legitimate? 

Which mentions some of the stuff you mentioned. I also remember my (to-be) manager having to fill out a training/work plan. As for the fees, they can be paid by either party, but since they can be somewhat substantial, they are often paid by the employer. Sorry this is so late, I missed your question earlier, hopefully this is enough to get you started (if its not too late). I'm not sure which country you live in so this final link might not be too helpful, but you if your willing to ignore all the uWaterloo mentions, my university talks a lot about getting visas here, here and here.
