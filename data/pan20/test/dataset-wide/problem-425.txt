And then tell your saga to your kids. For sure it would change the history of earth and mankind, but you get your message to the future anyway. 

is not that uncommon to think or fantasize to kill but then again, a sane, logical side of us will weighed that it would be bad to us and to our victim therefore we do other things. And she already got a dream to pursue so despite her dark past, and awkwardness, so she just can get on with her life. If her dreams are not related to figure out how to killing people while cheating the laws, and her urge to blood are that bad she may choose a hardcore bdsm or vampiric cult that shed blood as her hobbies. 

Psychometry (from Greek: ψυχή, psukhē, "spirit, soul" and μέτρον, metron, "measure"), also known as token-object reading, or psychoscopy, is a form of extrasensory perception characterized by the claimed ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object. Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that transfers knowledge regarding that object's history. That's definition that I got in wikipedia. Its one at the classic list of ESP. Then I vaguely know about atom decaying process. Would it seems plausible in some stretch of particle physics explanation, if someone had an 'ability' that with his/her touch to an object he/she can get information from the atomic decay of the objects about when and what other object/materials had contact with? 

The easiest way is to come up with common enemy. A non-human one it seems, that way everyone can be agree to put aside their agenda (Religion, Claimed land and natural resources, economy, idealism) and join any human survivor to survive. Eliminate all human. Hyperpower nation usually had their own idealism and rules, and even a near perfect one, had some groups that do not like it because not everyone have the same habit, mindset and believe. So to make it 'that peaceful' it wouldn't be so human. Maybe Human had ceased to exist and replaced by ai, or another beings with organizational mind hive so therewouldn;t be any war ever again. Or you can make that peaceful global dominion hyperpower nation that filled with human with no common enemy. But it just what it's seems on first glance. This can be exist when 1 group with one idealism won, they slaughter all the opposed and buried their skeleton as deep as it can be. Then write them off history book. So there wont be any question ever again, but it is unlikely will hold for long. 

I would like to know how 'humanoid' they are, since it will affect whether they are ok with things like beauty or design or they would keep it based on its natural instinct despite they may have grasp complex logical thought. Another thing is arachnid and crabs share almost nothing alike about their nest, so it may need two answers. I will go with arachnid type first,some of their real counterparts had made a structure like this one below. While another type of bagworm moth had made a hybrid structure with branches that they glued with their natural secrement 

In this scenario, the world is our world today. But, recently an ancient script filled with knowledge that hadn't been known in modern science begun to virally spreading, most via internet. It goes with modern memo and explanations, how to video etc., so anyone who experiment on it while follow the guide thoroughly can practice magic just like another cooking recipe book, or fitness guide and achieve the result. Of course government, religion sect, modern science society, and logical people try to banished it, but overtime they too look at it as the missing piece of science and when they try to experiment on it they understand the universe better and over time it can be implemented to leap our technological advancement. So, my explanation of magic is like this: We take an analogy of the digital world to our world. Imagine a physic law is like a digital code, and magic is a means to alter the code. The code of the universe is written on so many levels, and every level also need different level of mastery. Like to create a fire ball, is as easy as learning simple CSS. While to alter fire behavior example make the fire to be cold not hot, will require a mastery equal to Phyton language. Of course the highest level allowed you to alter the fabric of the reality itself (but even the ancient script don't have this kind of advance knowledge). My question is: Is this kind of magic explanation can be accepted in science based perspective? Is there any existing explanation about possibilities of altering a physic rule ( I mean some real postulate, theory, or hypothesis) ? Thank you 

So far, we see an alien life form depicted based on earth type of animal kingdom, we see an insect like Zerg, a humanoid grey alien, etc. However sometimes we see alien like Guardians of galaxy's Groot, Transformers robotic alien, and others. The question: Is that possible that an intelligent alien life form that can think complex logical thought, communicate with each other (and with us possibly), can move freely (not rooted on the ground), not in microscopic scale, and not evolve in animalia kingdom path (it can be based on earth's fungi, plants, algae, or anything even sands or magma just not animals in the taxonomycal branch) can logically exist? if yes, how would it evolve? It can be walking plants, an intelligent crystal, a living planet to an interplanetary gas form of being that can move and think according to its own will. Edited: It should developed naturally (no involvement of other alien/human to kickstart, or managed the evolutionary process) 

Its easy to imagine that their structures involved hollowed sands stucture with many 'chimneys' like structure protruding from it. 

Lets say there is one being (it can as intelligent as a dog or an average human). But lets also give it/him a bit more unorthodox situations. 

So I think,a structure in resemblance like these (below without the need of our normal floors) will be expected even on their early age of civilization. 

A world like that would already find its balance. I mean, if magic users are around like hotcakes, there would be an animals/ prehistoric animals in that world somewhere on its branch of evolutionary tree that lead to homo magiens that can use magic. When there's a zebra that can do instant teleportation the lions in that world would develop something to survive. Same situations would be developed in its human. Lets just say that their magic attack happens instantly without drawing symbols on the ground, saying spells, or waving a wand. Although the magic user still minority it would be expected that the rest majority population would evolutionary develop some kind of defense while it can stay a subtle one. Maybe you got a tingling sensation (like spiderman have) in your head every time there will be a magic cast to you on a minutes in the future, just an ability like this would increase survival rate of the population and bring some balance in nature. If all of the above didn't occur, and magic user just born randomly like x-men mutant. We will have a society that kills or isolate them from infant stage. 

In an emerging space era, the currency model wouldn't be that far from today's era. Since even we can get a new source of gold in another place beside earth, a space mining process would be more complicated hence need more investment that would prevent a massive drop in gold values. When you say about trading, which means fuels (in any forms) would be a precious value that can give more affect to the economy. Politic is also in play here as infant government in remote space area who just barely capable to provide basic needs may need and abide to a 'parent government' (maybe in earth or other large capital planets) that shares a common currency. (So we may see a Saturn Dollar $$) Another possible things is a evolved model of currency that's not based on scarcity of precious tangible things, says like Bitcoins. This will be one of a possible solutions for currency to prevent our economy to fall to chaos when human can get their hands on a planet that entirely made of diamonds or gold.
