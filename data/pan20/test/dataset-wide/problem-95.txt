So as of now the earth's rotation is already slowing, at a rate of about 2ms a year, mostly due to the moon's tides so in about 5 Billion years the earth will stop rotating and eventually start spinning the other way! The only way for the earth to become tidally locked would be complete removal of the moon and some sort of catastrophic event (such as a meteor strike) that would remove the majority of %99.72 earth's angular momentum, an incident that would probably kill all life on earth. The only non-catastrophic event that could have this effect is a large body coming into orbit around the earth that would have the same effect as the moon only in greater proportion. [EDIT] This would cause massive waves flooding most of the continents but it MIGHT not kill everyone] 

To change the ammout of time in a planets year one must adjust the height of the orbit via keplers law. If you want that planet to remain in the green zone of a star you would have to increce the heat output of the star. Changing the heat/size would change the colour of the star which would change the evolution of flora and fauna to maximise use of this diffrent light. 

This depends on availability of appendages, Helen Keller was able to communicate effectively enough to earn a bachelor's degree with no sound or sight (or pheromones that I know of.) She communicated with shapes and motions of her hands in contact with another person. If you creatures have some dexterous way to connect with another creature by changing shapes of that appendage they could communicate complex ideas. Ideas for how to add inflection: Vibration, Changing surface (extending spikes, slime etc), or even adjusting body temp. 

In Short: Not Significantly. In Long: As covered by several of the other respondents humans evolved to not need such natural weapons. Setting that aside hypothetically if we did have some sort of natural weapon AS WELL as our other evolutionary advantages (Tool Use, endurance, etc.) one could reason that we simply would not use tools to do what we are naturally equipped to use. For example if we evolved with canine like claws we could conjecture that the 'discovery' of the knife would be delayed until a knife was 'discovered' that preformed the duty of the claw better than the claw. As well, we probably would develop tools to counter claws earlier due to human vs. human conflicts. 

All resources fall into 4 categories: Raw Resources, Completed Goods, Food, and Labor. The majorly of trade involves the first three but Food and Raw Resources tend to be the biggest. Earth because of its large level of development and placement in the green zone would most likely import raw resources and export Food and Completed Goods. Far Mining colonies would most likely be importing Food, Processed Goods, and Labor. Colonies in the "green zone" of their stars could very well create agriculture hubs and begin exporting Food as well. 

I'm new in Worldbuilding and I guess something like this might already be asked, but I would like to know what are pros and cons of robots replacing human in most repetitive jobs (with no high decision making required). And I'm talking about robotics that wouldn't have high-end AI. Wouldn't it let people to focus more on science and speed up our intellectual evolution? EDIT: I know replacing process is already slowly happening, but many would consider it to be something bad. So I'm talking about almost forcing the integration of robots to speed up our society in development. EDIT2: To those who are marking it as duplicate to scenarios where AI overcomes human - I even mentioned from beginning the we do not let AI to do anything important and we are not giving brain to machines. 

Rectangle is perfect shape for storing (as it works like building blocks). Hexagons would require more work as it's hard to produce bread in semi-perfect hexagon shape and can't really be placed in a container not to waste space. Rectangular shape has no such imperfection and is much more easier measurable. 

Talking about cancer: cancer cells are cells that mutate and refuse to die. Every day our bodies get rid of some of this kinda cells. Problem starts when they don't so that cell replicates in another cell that refuses to die and so on. If your cells die off at slower rate that means cancer cells have more time as well, so that actually increases your chances to die from cancer. Solution: There is actual limit of how many times a cells can be replaced and that sets our limit of maximum lifespan. You should find a way to stop this number of existing. I could write a lot about this but there is a video that will explain it for you better than I would: $URL$ 

That would make you weak - and I really mean weak - you couldn't do anything because you couldn't use energy in your body it would be like being paralyzed. If we forget that you would be a potato - injuries couldn't repair them selves fast enough and you would slowly destroy yourself. 

It's not that uncommon, many groups of people choose to have tattos that represent their association with certain group: Criminal tattoos are a type of tattoos associated with criminals to show gang membership and record the wearer's personal historyâ€”such as their skills, specialties, accomplishments, incarceration, world view and/or means of personal expression. Tattoos are strongly empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. Certain tattoo designs have developed recognized coded meanings. The code systems can be quite complex and because of the nature of what they encode, the designs of criminal tattoos are not widely recognized as such to outsiders. In Southern India, permanent tattoos are called pachakutharathu. It was very common in south India, especially Tamil Nadu, before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called godna. Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general Hindu population of India. In military there are often tattoos that represent if you are from air forces, marines, navy or any other specialized group. Problem could be that not everybody wants to show their social status or association to any group. Not everyone wants to have a tattoo as well. As tattoos are meant to be permanent they would divide people they couldn't just change tattoos as they want. 

They're not zombie overlords They're zombie protectors. First of all, no human citizen of this new country is required to serve in the military anymore. Maybe the old army was voluntary, maybe it was compulsory--regardless, it's something that can be pitched as a new kind of freedom. The zombies are here to shield us from the scheming, aggressive nations at our borders! The remaining soldiers can be disarmed and generously granted amnesty. They get to come home to their families! If they still want to take up a combat-oriented career, there are great opportunities for one or two humans to work alongside each zombie platoon, providing a friendly face as they patrol the border (and also dividing them up so they don't have opportunities to coordinate armed resistance). They're not just protectors They're a zombie labor force. Every large society requires tremendous amounts of human labor to function--agricultural work, mining, building, transportation, and (beyond a certain point) dangerous, low-skill industry. If zombies are capable enough to defeat an army, they're capable enough to swing a pick, or pull a plow and pick weeds. "A Zombie In Every Shed" is a reasonable propaganda slogan, especially if it gives everyone more leisure time. Sure, there is the slight price that families won't be able to bury their own dead anymore. But as long as Grandpa gets shipped off to another part of the country where the family can forget that he's been sentenced to endless labor in undeath, people will get used to it. They're not just a labor force They're a zombie surveillance instrument. Okay, this part is less suitable for propaganda, but depending on the nature of the necromancy in this world, the empress could very well use her well-distributed hordes to personally observe and gather information on any fomented rebellion, then quash it before it has a chance to gain momentum. Many people, even under occupation, are willing to accept peace over freedom if the rebellious never get a chance to disseminate and promote their ideas; if that peace also comes with an increased standard of living, it's a much easier sell. And the longer the era of peace, the more acceptable it becomes. Won't the rebels just hold their meetings out of sight of zombies if they catch on? Sure, but zombies might become effectively invisible in a surprisingly short time. (Right now, in 2017, thousands of people are installing internet-connected microphones in their own homes because it's a convenient novelty.) If they're given shrouds to reduce the sight and smell of rotting, people will start to see them as furniture. It might even be a popular project for people in domestic roles to knit or quilt shrouds for their zombies. The Overton Undead So those are your policies: disarmament and amnesty for human soldiers; migration of the armed forces to the living dead; broad distribution of free labor to undesirable jobs; and instant, quiet suppression of insurgency. Humans probably will thrive, just like some animals in captivity. And if they fail to thrive--hey, more free zombies.
