This is a common question that comes up - one I've (at least tried to) answer a few times. Let's try to understand what the Big Bang is. The Big Bang Theory is a model, and scientists came up with it when they observed the universe expanding - and thought that since the universe is now expanding it must have been smaller in the past. Running the clock backwards eventually means all of the universe was squeezed into a "singularity". Our physical models of the universe break down at this point - so we are not too sure of what the universe was like at the Big Bang. Notice that I said the universe was squeezed into a singularity - not the stuff inside the universe. This means space-time was also compressed into a single point. The universe is not expanding out into empty space - it is space-time itself that is expanding. Hence, there was no "before" the Big Bang - time (as well as space) was created when the Big Bang happened. There is no outside the universe! This means there is no outside the Big Bang! You can't go back in time and watch the Big Bang - since there is no universe or space (or time) outside the singularity. This can be very confusing, but I hope this helps!

If we assume the binary pair have equal masses, then by symmetry a star passing through their barycenter at right angles to their rotation plane will not change their symmetry. I did some simple simulations where a star with mass 0.1 flies through a binary in an originally circular orbit. The first case is with an interloper moving at speed 20. It passes through, losing a bit of momentum to the binary, that now moves slowly in the same direction. 

The gravitational binding energy of a solar mass star of uniform density is $3GM^2/5R = 2.2774\times 10^{41}$ Joule. The energy of a typical supernova is $10^{44}$ J. So it looks at first glance like the explosion could disperse the other star... ...except that this assumes more than a thousandth of the supernova energy is absorbed and does work on the star. If the other star is more than 16 stellar radii away then it will definitely not be hit by this much energy. And even if it is close enough, converting radiation to mass lift is not going to be efficient. The nova will mainly heat up the surface layer down a few optical depths, meaning a few thousand kilometers get very hot but it is doubtful this does more than push the star away a bit and induces some wobble. 

The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours. (Well, actually a little less, by about 17 minutes, but close enough.) That's $360^\circ$ in 24 hours, or about $15^\circ$ per hour. $15^\circ$ is 30 times the width of the Sun or Moon. The Sun moves exactly that fast (on average), the stars a smidgen faster, and the Moon a tad slower. (The Moon lags behind the stars by approximately its own width every hour.) Since Venus is never more than about $45^\circ$ from the Sun, it always sets at most 3 hours after the Sun does, and rises at most 3 hours before. 

Kepler's third law is trivial (in my opinion) compared to his first law. I am quite impressed that he was able to deduce that the orbits were ellipses. To get that, he had to go back and forth plotting Mars' direction from Earth and Earth's direction from Mars. He knew the length of both planets' years, so observations taken one Mars year apart would differ only because Earth had moved. But maybe not so trivial. He published his first two laws in 1609. The third law didn't come along until ten years later, in 1619. With ten years to work on it, even the most obscure relationship will eventually be found. To discover a ratio-of-powers relationship, plot the logarithms of the numbers. In your example with $x^4 = y^3$, the logs would plot on a straight line with a slope of $3/4$. The timing is right. Napier published his book on logarithms in 1614. Kepler may have on a whim applied this shiny new mathematical tool to his crusty old data. The major hurdle was that at the time there were only six known planets, so he didn't have an abundance of data points, and the ones he had were by no means precise. Kepler's other problem is that none of his laws made any sense to him. They fit the data, but he had no idea why. He didn't have Newton's laws of motion to work from, he had no understanding of force, momentum, angular momentum, and certainly not gravity. So far as he knew, the planets moved the way they did because God decreed it, and angels were tasked with pushing the planets along their orbits. The outer planets moved slower because they were being pushed by lesser angels. (Feynman makes the comment that we understand so much more now. We now know that the angels are on the outside pushing in toward the Sun.) 

I'm not 100% sure if I'm understanding what your asking, but if your question could be rephrased as "how do we measure distances in an expanding universe?", then I can try to answer that. Depending on what astronomers measure they use different distance measurements. For example the comoving distance between two objects takes into account the expansion, and so does not change with time. If you know the redshift of the galaxy, for example by measuring the spectrum, and have a cosmological model, then you can calculate the comoving distance. Here cosmological model means constraints on the amount of dark energy, matter (both dark and regular) and radiation. The current accepted model is that the universe is around 70% dark energy and 30% matter, most of which is dark (with negligible radiation). The percent here refers to the fraction of energy density. Note that these values change over time, mostly since dark energy is like a property of space and so increases as the universe expands. For some more info see: $URL$ Note that light years is a definite measurement, and so we can use it a valid unit for all distance measures. 

The last humans in this scenario likely die of starvation and/or drought during a natural short-term climate fluctuation. The basic issue is that as the sun heats up there will be a gradual reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (due to plant life but also silicate weathering, which speeds up in warm environments). There may also be a reduction in volcanic outgassing, although I think the timeframe is too slow. This is bad for plants, since they will get less CO$_2$ to photosynthesise from, and it will reduce the climate stabilising feedback so temperatures will start going up as the sun increases in luminosity. Eventually we get to a runaway greenhouse stage where water vapour alone triggers overheating, but this is possibly long after the biosphere is mostly dead. The most complete model of this I have seen is this paper by Franck, Bounama, & von Bloh. They estimate complex multicellular life to go extinct in 0.8â€“1.2 Gyr. Note that this will happen long before the sun becomes even a subgiant. In any case, if this model is correct we should expect that slowly but surely the future humans would be forced to migrate to cool regions and would be especially limited by the dwindling biomass available. But beside this they will be subject to normal random climate fluctuations that sometimes create decade-long droughts or other misfortunes, and it is likely one of those that actually gets the last individuals. Of course, the scenario assumed makes some very strong assumptions. In order to remain recognisably humans over millions of years these humans would have to engage in deliberate genetic control, otherwise genetic drift will make them mutate into new species. It assumes that nobody does anything about the long-term trend. And so on. 

I'll be brief in my answer but I suggest you look at the wikipedia page on dark energy for a good starting point for further research. ($URL$ At the present time it is believed that the universe will continue to expand at an ever increasing rate due to the driving force of "dark energy" (which is as mysterious as it sounds!). Since space itself is expanding there is no limit to the rate of change in the distance between them, and it is quite possible this speed exceed that of light - meaning observers at each point will not be able to see each other. With this in mind, eventually (in many billions of years) the universe will be expanding so fast that we will not be able to see any other galaxies, and eventually any other stars after much more time has passed. If the acceleration continues at the increasing rate Earth and the Sun will be "pulled" apart, and at this point the situation on Earth is pretty bleak - no Sun, no stars and no external light. In the extremely far future it is possible the acceleration of space will cause Earth itself to be torn apart, and the eventual fate of the universe is for every molecule, atom and particle to be broken apart until all that remains are stray photons. So that's a pretty bad scenario as far as the ultimate fate of the universe goes, but at the moment it seems like that is what may happen. It's very important to note that extending the increasing rate of acceleration into the future that far is not good practice and probably won't provide very accurate predictions. 

We have found instances of asteroids that are mostly rubble piles, but spinning fast enough that they would fly apart if bound only by gravity. The most likely binding force is static charge, although some sort of glue is not out of bounds. I don't know if either of these would be called "hydrostatic", but if the question is really "Is gravity the only force that can bind a non-solid object together?" the answer is no. 

You know, the first time someone told me this, I was absolutely certain they were confused, ignorant, or otherwise mistaken, and I told him he had his facts wrong. To be precise, we were talking about an observer on the equator. I maintained that the Sun would rise due east and set due west, all year round. He said no. What gave me pause, though, is that this person was far from ignorant, so maybe the other two appellations didn't fit either. I went home and tried to construct a convincing proof of my side, and in the middle of the night a very simple and convincing proof did come to mind. Except that it was a proof that I was wrong. Imagine that you're on equator at sunrise on the summer solstice. Due east is along the equator. But the plane of the equator is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit, and the Sun is well above (north) of it. You cannot see it due east at sunrise. It has to be $23.5^\circ$ north of east. (Remember, this is for an observer on the equator.) By the same token, the Sun must rise $23.5^\circ$ south of east on the winter solstice, and gradually transition between these extremes during the year.
