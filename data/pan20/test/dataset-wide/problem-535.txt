Please see my comment above. Reading the complete FAQ actually confirms my claims, as the track dropout is "horizontal AND opens at the rear", whereas your dropouts "open diagonally towards the bottom": 

It depends what kind of lock you have. If it took a thief a failed attempt I assume it's a good one, so take it to a locksmith or anyone with power tools, preferably with a proof of ownership of the bike. The harder it is to destroy, the more convinced you should be that you should buy the exact same lock again :) 

I think your best option is to change the crank. A 2015 Deore or a SLX crank are not only extremely good value for money but they also carry a lot of modern technologies (search the net for reviews, everybody loves them) comparing with your old 2002 product. A modern 2015 Deore (cheapest, entry level) works much better than a 2002 XTR because 13 years of development really make a big difference. Good luck and happy riding. 

It's unlikely to be carpal tunnel, though that's a possibility. A major nerve in the hand, feeding the fingers, runs across the palm, right where one tends to lean on the bars. Constant pressure on this nerve irritates it and causes the numbness and tingling that cyclists often experience. I'm not sure how much irritation it takes to cause actual damage, but I suspect in most cases the situation becomes intolerable before serious damage is done. In addition, pressure and the constant cramped grip that especially new cyclists tend to use cuts off blood flow in the hand. There are several (relatively) major blood vessels that run across the palm. The solution, of course, is to relieve the pressure on the palm. Padded gloves help, but beyond a modest amount padding can be counter-productive since it spreads the pressure out over a wider area, causing a wider area to be deprived of blood and numbing out more area such that a minor change in hand position doesn't achieve a "fresh" grip. I once had some special gloves that were really good -- they had "Sorbothane" padding (a sort of rubber), but, more than that, the padding was in the form of narrow ribs, so that they sort of "massaged" the palms as you rode. But they wore out and I've never found replacements. (I've often thought someone should make bar grips with similar ribs, but I've never seen anything.) Otherwise, the best solution is to relieve the pressure on your palms by adjusting your riding position. Raise the handlebar and move it closer to you (more to the rear). And maybe move your seat forward a bit. The other thing to do, of course, is to change hand positions frequently. Traditional drop bars give you several good positions for riding, and with straight bars you can get bar extensions to give you alternate positions. Added: One problem I've noted with bikes these days is that they're built to "look mean" on the sales floor, with the handlebar unrealistically (for most people) low. And with the threadless headsets raising the bar beyond a half-inch or so is apt to require changing out parts, something people often don't know is even a possibility, even if they aren't reluctant to do it for various emotional and financial (and macho) reasons. Added: I once ran some back-of-the-envelope calculations to see how much pressure the body was placing on the hands, vs blood pressure, and what I worked out is that upper body mass and leg/back strength (which affects how much weight relief the legs offer) are critical factors. When someone is over roughly 200 pounds with poor strength (which I have due to polio) then it's impossible to spread the weight out enough with padding to keep from cutting off blood flow. If you're lighter or with better leg/back strength then you're probably wondering what all the fuss is about. 

I had a spate of these; all the tubes had an elliptical, smooth rubber section immediately around the valve, and then a weld joining this to the body of the tube. The failure was always at this weld, and it looked as if the tube had herniated (bulged out in a single spot before bursting there). After ruling out tape problems, burrs, sharps, valve hole diameter etc. - I finally figured out the problem. The elliptical section is less flexible than the main body of the tube, so after pushing it above the bead as Zippy suggests, it wasn't fully descending to sit flush against the rim. This left a void between the rim and the less-flexible part of the tube around the valve; the more flexible section of the rim then tried to expand around the weld to fill this gap, and that's where it burst. The solution is (touch wood) to pull the valve back down after the tyre is seated and the tube partially inflated, and tighten the nut more than usual (and then slacken off). When the tyre is fully inflated, double-check that there is no bump near the valve, that the bead is seated properly there, and that the valve doesn't move if you tug it towards the hub (not too hard!). 

As @Slovakov said, these kind of protections are never seen in XC, the main reason being that XC is a low risk activity. You usually go at slower paces and you never put yourself in situations where there is a likely chance you can loose control and have a high speed crash in a dangerous zone (as you do in downhill or freeride, for example). Of course you can fall and hurt yourself, but you can fall and hurt yourself if you are trail running, you can twist an ankle if you are playing basketball, or hurt a tendon weightlifting. You have to understand physical activity isn't without a certain degree of risk. The only reason why helmets are highly recommended is because, even in the unlikely event of having a crash, an impact in your skull can have huge consequences for yourself - much more than any other part of your body. Also, if you are concerned with your safety, it is my belief training yourself and learning to ride a bike in a technical situation is a very valuable skill. Lower your saddle, move your ass right to the back, learn to control and feel your brakes, etc. Start with easy areas and progressively advance to places which are more rocky and have more inclination. Being comfortable around these situation plays a big part in your safety. With that said, if you still want knee protection, the most lightweight I know of are POC VDP Air Knee and Elbow Pads, Dainese Trail Skins or Race Face Charge Leg Guards. Six Six One also makes pads with various densities. You will easily find all of these with a Google search. Have fun and safe riding :) 

I personally wouldn't worry about most stickers and decals. Paint can be more of a problem, or if you used the wrong clear coating over a sticker/decal. It's a question of whether the particular paint reacts with the plastic shell. 

First you need a good strong light, with a reasonable beam width/height. Then it should be aligned so that the beam is pointed immediately forward and a bit down, with the center of the beam striking the ground maybe 15 feet in front of the bike. With proper spread this will illuminate an area of the road from 25-30 feet in front to about 5 feet in front, and about 5 feet wide. Adjust from there based on local conditions/personal preferences. When adjusted this way there should be no significant problem with "blinding" oncoming traffic. 

If what you currently have are friction shifters then almost certainly your sprockets are not designed for indexed shifting. Converting to "indexed" shifters will not give you indexed shifting, only lousy, unreliable shifting. To convert a non-indexed bike to indexed you'd need to replace the sprockets. Replacing the rear (if you can find a compatible replacement) would be relatively inexpensive, but replacing the front (which would probably involve replacing the crank) might very well cost more than the bike is worth. (However, if your setup is actually "SIS", then you should already have indexed shifters, and you "only" need to be sure that the new set is compatible with the old in terms of cable distance traveled per gear.) 

First, I think you made a good decision. Hydraulic disc brakes are the way to go, and the M355 are really nice for the price. Also, I assume brake pads/discs are not contaminated and caliper is straight in relation to the disc. These are indeed the cheapest brakes, and therefore there is not much place for adjustments. If without touching the lever the pads don't touch the disk, and when you apply they do, than I would say they are ok. Maybe you would like them to do have a tighter feel, but with this model there isn't much you can do apart from lever distance to handlebar (play with this a little to feel confortable). I don't think overbleeding helps. It shouldn't cause any harm, but the brakes were designed to work in a specific way, so it might affect behavior under heat, or might be causing the "instant brake" feel you are talking about, or might cause rubbing with new pads. Another thing to notice is that it is normal, even in good brakes, that the rear and front feels slightly different, because of expansion on the tube under braking (there is so much tube going to the rear, right?). And also, as the rider you are more sensible to brake forces in the front, and they affect more the dynamics of the bike. One thing I would recommend you to do is to bleed according to manufacturer's instructions and try to adapt. The change from pads or mechanical disc is huge in terms of the relation between lever force - braking force, and it is normal that as a rider you need some time to feel comfortable as you change muscle memory. For example, on my road bike I always pull the lever/pads with as much strength as I can to do an emergency brake, whereas in my mountain bike with hydraulics I have to re-teach myself that I must always modulate brake lever even in an emergency brake. The dynamics are very different. Of course there might be something wrong with them, but from your description I doubt it. If you can't take it out of your mind though, go to a shop, pretend you want to buy a bike with the same brakes as you have and ask for a small test-drive :) 

I'm sure the driver's insurance can. Get an assessment from a bike shop, and a quote for any repairs possible, or the cost of a like-for-like replacement. Get the driver to pay for that. 

Seems that is the Look Memory Eyelet, where you can attach some kind of tab to help get replacement cleats in the same position. This Keo page seems to have a video on the subject, but I can't view it immediately ... 

This is UK-based, but I'll using inside/near-side to mean left in a country where you drive on the left, and right in a country where you drive on the right. Under UK law, unless you're trying to get a conviction for dangerous or careless driving, it's more useful to consider the civil system. There's plenty of case law here (particularly for motorbikes), and the liability often seems to be split based on whether the (motor) cyclist could reasonably forsee a risk, whether their speed was reasonable for the conditions and visibility, etc. I can dig out references for this stuff if you're interested in the details (IANAL, though - this is just advice I've received from others). The upshot is, as a cyclist, that if you ride defensively you should avoid most collisions you could have forseen, and the other party would be more - or wholly - liable for any collision you couldn't reasonably have anticipated. 

If your bike is still under warranty, I don't think it is worth it. If it isn't, it will for sure put more stress on the frame but I don't think it will brake. This depends a lot of your weight and ride style, and keep in mind Cube says not to do it, so it is your entire responsibility. I wouldn't do it. I am pretty sure you can change your suspension between 80, 100 and 120mm of travel. Please check here. Rock Shox has really good manuals so you might even be able to do it yourself, otherwise take it to your bike shop. Changing a suspension is simple, if you have the patience and the time to learn, and you just need one or two allen tools for most of it. However, sometimes taking the bottom part of the headset from the old fork is a pain. Search on youtube for fork replacement. If you feel like it, I think you can try and if something goes wrong take it to a shop in pieces. They will figure it out :) Before buying, confirm with the seller the fork will fit the frame, specially if it is an used fork he might have shorten the part of it that goes into the headset and it's shorter size might not fit your frame or your favorite stem position. IMPORTANT: Please see @mikes comment below. 

Nutrition: isn't that hard, although if you haven't already, you might want to spend some time figuring out what food works for you on the move. You want things that are fairly calorie-dense, probably not too much fibre (see point #3) and agree with your stomach while exercising - this is specific to you and your digestive system. If you're going for endurance, you don't need massive sugar spikes on a regular basis, so normal food is probably fine. Something sweet as a pick-me-up is a good idea (see bullet #1), but it doesn't need to be the bulk of your calories. Hydration: varies a lot with temperature, effort, and again your body and how much you sweat. Carrying 100 miles-or-kilometres-worth of liquid yourself is difficult, so this is where having support personnel to hand over replacement bottles is useful. I'm pretty sure I've never gone that far without stopping for a refill (again, see #3) 

Adaptation greatly varies from person to person - are your core muscles strong, do you have good flexibility, problem in your column/shoulders, etc. It's har dto give you an answer. One think to take into account is that most road bikes force a a hard posture on the rider, on the pursuit on speed, mainly on your low back and neck. This is true for any ages. Given that you are 43 I would recommend at the very least an endurance bike, instead of a road one. They are very similar, but endurance bikes are designed to race on hard surfaces like cobalt, and have some compliance on the frame, slightly bigger tires and softer contact points with your body. Take a look here so you have an idea of what I am talking about. Another option is a cyclocross bike which might be even more comfortable, and its still a fast road bike. Keep in mind the best bike is not the lightest one or the more aerodynamic, is the one you feel better and have more fun in, so resist the temptation to get the cool think on the shop and get something that suits you the best. It doesn't really matter if you take 5 more minutes for the that 10 mile run. Whatever you choose, make an effort to maintain a good posture while riding and ask your shop to check your biometrics and adapt the bike for your body, and it's also a good idea to start slow, instead of going right away for a 60 km bike ride to test 'the ergonomics'. With the right bike and since you are a cyclist I am pretty sure you will adapt in 2 or 3 weeks. You should try to cycle more than once per week though, even if it's just small shopping trips.
