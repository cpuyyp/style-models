The only way that interrupter levers could make much of a difference is if the installation requires extra housing (which would compress under braking, increasing the lever travel for a given braking pressure). If you're not bottoming out the levers, though, that's not the source of your problem (and from the picture I don't see why the interrupters would require additional housing anyway). I think Daniel R Hicks is correct here--your lever/caliper setup likely isn't giving you enough mechanical advantage. You're squeezing the levers as hard as you can, but you're just not getting enough pad/rim force for decent stopping power. You notice this mostly in wet weather because there's less pad/rim friction when they're wet. Finger positioning on the levers is one thing that can make a difference--keep them as far away from the pivots as you can. On my drop-bar commuter bike, for example, I need to ride in the drops during wet weather because I just don't get enough mechanical advantage with my hands on the hoods. You might also see better braking performance if you switch to softer brake pads, or rain-specific pads like Kool-Stop Salmon or similar, though I've read that the Salmons tend to chew up rims pretty quickly when it's dry. 

You win non-TT bike races by being able to accelerate just that little bit much more than your competition. 99.9% of the time you are riding exactly the same speed as everyone else, what makes the difference between winning and losing is your ability to accelerate just a bit better than your competitors. Humans are very low power engines. Since F = MA, one of the easiest ways to increase A is to decrease M. Low weight, low drag wheels will help you accelerate faster. Since wheels are rotational mass, you get a bigger bang for your buck in reducing their weight. Bike racers obsess over the weight of gear to improve their ability to get to speed, reducing weight generally doesn't help your average speed much ( except when climbing a long hill). 

Riding into a stiff headwind is pretty similar to climbing a steep hill and a lot more demoralizing. My guess is that you've got lot's of wind. Find a loop where you're doing 20-30 minutes into a 20kph headwind and you'll physically ready for hill climbing. What will be hard to simulate is the mental parts of pacing yourself correctly over the whole climb. A headwind tends to be a constant steady effort, whereas most hills vary in grade and you need to learn to pace yourself on the steepest parts. If you're doing long days in hilly country, even just a short hard effort early in the ride can affect the whole day. You've only got so many matches, try and keep at least one or two in reserve. 

Knobby treads are really only useful in mud, sand, or snow. On roads (even rough ones) they just add extra weight and noise. Of the tires listed so far, the Bontrager and Panaracer tires look like better choices than the NanoRaptor. I've heard good things about the Schwalbe Big Apple as well. 

I think the tires would be durable enough (my winter commute in nearby Kitchener, ON is about 20 km/day and my Marathon winters hold up pretty well) but they're definitely going to feel more sluggish than a road tire. If you're normally running them with enough air pressure to keep the studs clear of the pavement, I think that kind of defeats the purpose of them (and that much pressure makes the ride a little harsh for my liking as well). Carbide studs will last as long as the carcass of the tire holds together, and there's always a chance of running into an icy patch somewhere, even if 99.5% of your route is bare and dry. 

What parts are you willing to replace? You can't get smaller than 34 in the front w/o replacing the crankset with some kind of MTB crank. You'll likely need to replace your front derailleur as well, and there are issues with indexed shifting that you'll need to figure out. You can't get larger than at most 32t in the back w/o replacing the rear derailleur with an MTB version. There are also indexing issues between road/MTB derailleurs. If you get a road extended cage or triple rear derailluer, you can probably make an MTB 11-32 cluster work with your current shifters. However, in the long run it's probably cheaper just to get a triple chainring on the front. You'll have a much easier time getting the gears that work for you. 

You could try the "soak chain in paraffin wax" method. That would at least keep the water out of the rollers. Good how to page: $URL$ It's cheap and is likely as good as anything else. Salt water will pretty much destroy every part of a bicycle, washing with fresh water every day might be your best investment in keeping the bikes running as long as possible. The wax method helps there as it is very resistant to washing out. Good Luck, and look for cheap bulk chain on ebay.... 

Proper size is definitely important--it's not a good deal, no matter what the price, if it doesn't fit you. In my experience, top tube length is the one that's most important to get right. There's a bit of latitude for adjusting the reach to the bars by changing stem length but this will change the handling dynamics so you don't really have more than a couple cm of adjustment. Adjusting the reach by moving your seat forward or back isn't really an option. The seat positioning should be largely determined in relation to the pedals. If the seat's not positioned properly with respect to the pedals, I feel like I'm constantly sliding forward or backward as I ride. In your case--compare the FP2 geometry specs to your current bike, or take a ride on a bike with similar geometry. You can also try an online fit calculator, competitivecyclist.com for example, to give you an idea of what size you should be looking at. In the end, there's no substitute for actually riding the bike in question, though some fit problems only become apparent after an hour or more on the bike. Looking at the FP2 geometry, the top tube seems long-ish for the nominal size, and the sizing chart seems to run a little big. As an example, I'm 5'8" tall and generally prefer about a 54-55 cm top tube. Therefore, I'd probably be most comfortable on a 53 cm FP2 even though I'm 2" taller than the max recommended height on the sizing chart you linked. This is all, of course, specific to my preferred riding position and body geometry but suggests that the 55 cm frame might not be out of the question for a six-footer. Make sure you're comfortable on the bike (or one of similar geometry) before plunking down the cash, though. Peter White Cycles has a pretty comprehensive article on bike fit that I learned a lot from--it's more qualitative in its approach but gives a good understanding of things to take into account. In short--maybe, but it depends on your preferred riding position and body geometry. 

The gear ratio is exactly the same, the only possible difference is in the efficiency of the power transmission. Big/Big is generally more efficient, so it should be better for both, unless there is some reason that greater power losses in the transmission chain help "spinners". So they will potentially feel different if you can notice the difference ( pretty small ) in the efficiency of the drive train. I don't see how that translates to masher vs spinner though. $URL$ 

This word is key to understanding what weight loss mostly helps with "reactivity" I think what you really getting at is that the bike accelerates faster. Humans are very low power engines so any change in weight can produce noticeable changes in acceleration. But they don't produce that much change in overall speed. You get to your top speed faster, but that's about it. For "just riding around" this may or may not be important. For racing and riding in a group where you are making constant accelerations to stay with the pack, it can make a huge difference. This why racers obsess about weight for climbing/racing bikes, but focus more on aerodynamics for TT bikes. The primary limiting factor on total overall speed is aerodynamics, not bike weight. There is some advantage to reducing "rotational" weight, but it's not that big if you crunch the numbers. 

I've got a couple of the previous generation Filzer computers (DB4zl, wired, no cadence) and have had to replace a wiring harness. They don't take kindly to abuse. The computers themselves seem to hold up pretty well. Wireless can be prone to interference, particularly from high-power LED headlights--buck regulators can emit a lot of stray RF. I prefer to stick with wires. 

Set-torque wrenches are the nicest to use, but some (including mine) don't allow you to set torque when tightening a left-hand thread (left pedal, for example). Usually there's a corresponding right-hand thread to tighten at the same point in the assembly process so I do that first and just tighten the left-hand thread by feel. As previous posters have mentioned, you probably won't find a single torque wrench capable of doing every specified torque but 20-210 Nm should be a decent 'big' wrench. You shouldn't run into any torques larger than 210 Nm but there is a lot of stuff that gets less than 20 Nm. I'd guess that it should be fine for doing the cap nuts, but of course you will need to know the specified torque or there will be no purpose in using a torque wrench anyway. 

Switching to a single ring in front solves 2 and you can get single rings for your crankset up to 50t. 50/34 is still a pretty low gear on the roads. Blackspire makes them. $URL$ Adding some spacers to the chainring bolts can help with the clearance issue. As far as the chain goes, if the cranks are spaced for 10 spd then you should have no problem. The only real problem occurs when the chainrings are far enough apart that the skinny 10spd chain can get jammed between the chainrings. 

There is a very handy gizmo that you can use with road derailleurs to increase the size of cog you can use in the back. Wolf Components Road Link I use it on one of my bikes to have a 11-32 rear cassette. The cassette spacing on Shimano 10spd is the same between road and mtb, so you should be able to just replace your current cassette with an MTB one. You will still be within the safe range of the capability of your rear derailleur. Long cage Road derailleurs generally have 39t capacity, so 16+ 21 = 37. So you could even go to an 11/34 MTB cassette. You can safely go beyond the capacity of the derailleur if you avoid small/small gear usage, However, that's hard to do with a compact double up front. Another solution that I think you might prefer is to switch to a smaller crankset up front. For most people 46/30 and 11/28 in the back makes a really good setup. Unfortunately, 46/30 cranks are not the easiest thing to obtain, but that is changing with the popularity of "Gravel" bicycle components. FSA makes a nice 46/30 "adventure" crankset and you can get those chainrings with MTB cranksets like the Shimano 10spd XT double. 

Road tires with no obvious defects can definitely lose 10 PSI per day--there just isn't a whole lot of air volume so the tiniest leak through the tube or the valve will drop the pressure in a hurry. Moral of the story: check the air pressure every time you take out the road bike. 

You should be able to look up the frame geometry (useful for comparing to an online fit tool) on the manufacturer's web site if the bike is new enough. Many times there will also be an approximate frame size-height sizing chart available online as well. I've tried the online fit calculator that GuyZee recommends and it seems to work well for me, for what that's worth. 

Not true--the pad/rim contact force should be more or less independent of the brake design (assuming the pad/rim friction coefficients are about the same, as they will be if the pads are of similar material). V-brakes tend to require more cable pull to actuate than other types, which does make them incompatible with road brake levers. No problem with the wheels, though.
