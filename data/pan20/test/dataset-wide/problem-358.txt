Having all 4 feet be blades is really really bad. It limits the creatures to a single fragile biome and is very very calorie wasteful as a form of locomotion. Ever notice how a cat will walk around something stupid instead of stepping over it (like a pencil, or towel,etc etc). What it is doing in conserving calories a fraction at a time. Because that's how important calories are in nature!!! The reason why animals with horror movie style adaptations don't exist is because the calories to make a gaping maw full of razor barbed tentacles or a natural nerve-gas producing organ are so ludicrously calorie expensive to maintain that the animal could never catch enough prey or eat enough plants to sustain something like that. Having to wrench all 4 blades out of soppy spongy material would be wasting hundreds of calories an hour, which is like lighting $100 bills on fire hourly as far as natural selection is concerned, its just unsustainable. Its called evolutionary over-specialization. Animals with ridiculous traits like the saber toothed tiger, gargantuan sized cave bear, or reliance on a single biome or food type like the panda go extinct very easily. Creatures that are versatile and adaptable with a wide array of options for prey, environment, and climate will survive whilst ones that specify too distinctly will go extinct or become a evolutionary dead end. This creature can dig the front two in for a sudden burst of speed kind of like a catapult, but it can switch over to caloric economy mode and just run on two feet when it doesn't need to be attacking or chasing something. It has a very powerful adaptation for its environment but it isn't ludicrous and impossible to sustain. 

A pulsed fission engine like project Orion would have been able to move a 10 million ton ship into earth orbit. The downside is that they were achieving the propulsion with nuclear detonations. They would launch the atomic-bombs out of the back and detonate them a good distance away with a giant hemispherical "pusher-plate" which was basically a giant shock absorbing piston with a cup at the end to "catch" the energy from the blast. 

High-G environments arent condusive to tall creatures. In the Marines we had to specifically re-learn how to fall down because in full gear your full weight can be pushing 375 to 400 pounds and its really easy to seriously injure yourself by just falling over. On a planet with 10 times the gravity I would weigh in at almost 2000 pounds. My diaphragm wouldnt be able to inflate my lungs, my blood would pool in my feet instead of circulating, falling down would be like getting hit by a truck but that is irrelevant because my body would basically collapse under its own weight into a mushy puddle before I could fall down anyways. Humanoid body structure is not suited to high G at all. To give you an idea of how crazy high G can get you must realise that on a planet with 10 times the gravity of earth an object dropped from 1 meter would be moving at 219 miles per hour by the time it hit the ground. 

No, the differing gravitational forces exerted upon an object as it moves closer to a black hole's event horizon tear the object in half. As an object moves towards the black hole it will be torn in half fractally down to the sub-atomic elemental level. IE, you get torn in half, then those pieces get torn in half, then those pieces get torn in half etc etc down to your constituent quantum particles. There are also relativistic effects to the person entering the event horizon they would experience the above obliteration nearly instantly, while to the outside observer watching them they would appear to slow in infinitely smaller increments until they seemed to come to a complete stop and be frozen in stasis. Its kinda mind-boggling to describe, but I will use a scenario to describe it: If you were to toss a digital stop-watch into a black hole you would see it keeping track of time slower and slower. The second counter would begin counting in periods of minutes, then hours. eventually it would stop seemingly frozen. Then the light from the screen would begin to red shift down the spectrum until it was in the radio-wave length of electromagnetic energy. You would need a radio telescope and several years to watch the second counter count only one second, then decades, then centuries. Eventually it would slow down so much you would be stuck waiting billions of years in between individual photons emitted by the screen to reach you. So nothing can actually enter a black hole from the point of view of an outside observer, it can only get infinitely closer to it in infinitely longer and infinitely smaller increments without ever touching the event horizon. Meanwhile to the object entering its just immediate obliteration. 

It is fired from a standard infantry 40mm grenade launcher. It is laser guided with a maximum range of 2500 meters, or 2.5 kilometers. It's warhead is an HEDP (High Explosive Dual Purpose) which is to say that it is a HEAT conical shaped charge that also has been optimized to throw shrapnel giving it dual use against anti personnel. As a general rule of thumb HEDP can penetrate twice as much armor as its diameter, giving this missile an optimum penetration ability of up to 80mm of steel armor (a wee bit more than 3 inches). Its basically the smallest possible guided missile with any sort of real performance. Smaller and you don't have enough warhead to take advantage of the Munroe effect (shaped charge armor penetration physics). Also any smaller and you cant utilize a big enough rocket motor to have any real range. Regular 40mm HEDP grenade launcher rounds would work too but they are difficult to target as they have a ballistic arc and you have to get within 400 meters to have any chance of a hit. In modern combat 400 meters is basically point blank, even regular infantry weapons like the 240 bravo 7.62x51 medium machinegun can accurately engage infantry at 2000 meters. So yeah, I think the PIKE or something like it is exactly what you are looking for. Regular 40mm HEDP pictured here: 

Water transfers force more efficiently than air, so pretty much any sort of blast from a device configured to perform as a depth charge will do. 

From my understanding, gravity is the action of mass upon the spatial and temporal fabric of the universe. As far as I can tell reversing the direction time flows in would not change the mass of an object, therefore the effect that mass has upon time and space would not change.
