While the difference isn't particularly large in the early years, it is clear that he intentionally selected the RCP value which results in the greatest predicted increases because that will maximize the difference between predictions and observations 

Is this true? Has the Catholic Church lifted more people out of poverty than any other civic institution? 

No. A study was published in 2006 specifically looking for CFCs and other halogenated compounds in volcanic plumes. The study involved collecting gas samples while flying over fumaroles emitting volcanic gases. The samples were analyzed and CFCs were found above the detection limit, but were not volcanic in origin. As the abstract states: 

The article recognizes that there is some additional wear-and-tear each time the lamp is turned on, which may have an impact on life. It recommends turning them off if you won't need them for more than five minutes. 

The New York Times published an editorial on December 29, 2013 about Pope Francis titled "Radical Pope, Traditional Values" which includes the following statement: 

Both silver and copper are used in swimming pools to prevent algae growth, and in combination with lower-than-usual levels of chlorine, to control bacteria. In some of those applications, an electric current is applied to drive silver (or copper) ions into solution where they destroy algae cells. Other applications use a solution of "colloidal silver", which is silver in extremely fine particulate form. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control has an online publication titled "Water Disinfection for Travelers" which indicates that silver can be used for disinfection, though it's not effective against all potential contaminants: 

It depends on the renewable energy technology, but the answer is generally a few years. Here is a detailed analysis of the embodied energy in two sizes of large scale wind turbines (850 Kw and 3 MW). This study involved a very detailed assessment of the embodied energy, which showed that previous estimates were considerably low. In spite of this more realistic initial energy cost, the paper states that the embodied energy represents less than 5% of the total energy produced, assuming a 20 year life, and concludes: 

The above article is directed primarily at CFL bulbs, but here is a reference from the California Energy Commission based on more conventional tubular fluorescent bulbs. It comes to the same conclusion, stating 

No, it's not true. There is ample case law where the constitutionality of income taxes has been tested, and the courts have clearly ruled that income taxes are constitutional. Such claims are regarded as frivolous and subject to legal penalties. The IRS has a publication which clearly spells out the significant penalties for pursuing or promoting frivolous claims, and includes the following statement from the decision in one such case: 

Thus, 17% of the heat produced by an open candle flame is radiated to the surroundings, with the remaining 83% carried away by convection. This convective loss is equivalent to the convective loss up the chimney for an open fireplace, as it rises rapidly to the ceiling where it is effectively lost. A much improved design for a fireplace forces the combustion gases to flow through a circuitous path made of masonry materials, which absorb heat from the gases and radiate it to the room. This improves the overall efficiency of heating to much higher levels. Here is a study which showed one masonry fireplace achieved a heating efficiency of just under 80%. The stove looks like this in cross section: 

Thus, the tealight and flower pot function as a small-scale masonry fireplace, reducing the convective losses and increasing radiation to the room, as opposed to an open candle which functions like an open fireplace, with most of the heat lost by convection up the chimney. While the flower pot does increase the effectiveness of the candles as heaters, a few calculations can show how little heat it actually produces: Tea lights are made of paraffin wax, and are commonly about 38 mm in diameter and 16 mm high, and burn for 3 to 5 hours (per Wikipedia). Paraffin wax has a density of about 900 kg/m3, and a heat of combustion of about 46 MJ/kg. running through the math, we get 0.75 MJ/candle, and assuming a 4 hour burn time and 100% combustion efficiency (which is close, though not exact) that is a power output of 187,500 J/hr, or 52 watts. If 4 candles are burning at one time, this is 208 watts - probably quite close to the heat being generated by the two computers and two desk lamps in the room shown in the video. Would it be better to put a light bulb inside a flower pot? Probably, since it wouldn't produce any combustion by-products such as carbon monoxide, which flames inevitably do. But from a purely economic point of view, it may actually be cheaper to use the candles, if the pricing claim is true. If the candles truly cost 1 £ for 100, then the heat costs about 5 pence per kW-hr, which is lower than the 14 pence I found by looking at British electric rates. However, the cheapest source I found for these candles in the US is $6 per 100 (3.75£/100). At this price, the candle heat costs about 18 pence per kW-hr, which is more than electricity. Finally, there is nothing new about this idea. Googling "Candle Heater" brings up all sorts of sites, such as this one with flower pots 

Here is a link to Wikipedia's article on Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) which tabulates values for various energy sources. EROEI is the ratio of energy produced to the by energy consumed to produce it. Wind comes in at 18 - very close to the 20 for oil production. Photovoltaic solar is listed as 6.8. Both these are higher (i.e. better) than many other alternatives including shale oil (5) and tar sands (3). In other words, the return on both wind and solar is better than for oil moving through the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Note that much of the energy input for these technologies is currently fossil-based, but as these renewable sources come on line the percentage of fossil energy invested becomes lower and lower. 

But the study also measured a reduction the overall Antarctic ice gain, i.e. ice losses in other parts of Antarctica are catching up with ice gains in the EAIS: 

The Journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology contains an article titled "Silver as a Residual Disinfectant To Prevent Biofilm Formation in Water Distribution Systems" The article states that silver has known antimicrobial effects, and presents a mechanism of action: 

and goes on to clearly show that there is nothing more than a vague resemblance to human footprints. In fact, He concludes with 

The question specifically asks about the worst case for CO2 emissions - a country where most electricity comes from coal. This is also addressed in the CARB report, through the following figure which looks at different electricity mixes. The study used this mix for China: coal (79%), nuclear (2%), natural gas (2%), hydropower (16%), oil (2%), wind (0%), geothermal (0%), solar (6%), and biomass (0%). The BEV emissions from the China electric mix are about 2.25 times higher than for the California mix, which would put them at slightly higher than a conventional vehicle, based on the first figure. 

Kuban persuaded John Morris of the Institute for Creation Research, who participated in some of the early claims, to visit the site with him so they could evaluate the tracks together. Based on this, Morris published a paper which acknowledges that they are not human tracks, stating 

No. The alleged human footprints have been extensively analyzed and are most likely dinosaur tracks. There is absolutely no evidence that they are human. Glen J. Kuban has performed a very thorough analysis of the site, and states 

Right now, the answer is no, though at the time Obama made the claim the answer was yes. In both cases the numbers are very close. (Thanks to LessPop_MoreFizz for pointing out that the statement was accurate when Obama made it.) Data on the number of male African Americans in Federal, state, and local prisons and jails are available from the Bureau of Justice statistics here Data on the number of male African Americans enrolled in college are available from the US Census Bureau here They each contain the values for a number of recent years, which I have listed below. Up until 2006 there were more African American men in prison than enrolled in college. Since then, the reverse has been true - primarily because the college numbers have risen significantly. 

No. The link is to an oil trading company, not a technical source, and the reference provides no source for the information. "Maximum burning temperature", is not a standard measure for specifying jet fuel. Jet fuel specifications from ExxonMobil list many requirements and test methods, but do not mention "maximum combustion temperature", or any similar property. The highest temperature attainable when burning a fuel is known as the "Adiabatic flame temperature". Wikipedia provides a very good explanation, including: 

Probably not. Air infiltration in houses is measured by a "blower test" in which a fan is installed in a door, and used to draw air out of the house. Here is a discussion and video of air inleakage through a gasketed switchplate during a blower test in a home. The artcle is on EnergyVanguard.com, which is a site and organization focused on energy efficiency in homes, with a lot of attention focused on air infiltration. The author explains that air infiltration through electric boxes is a real problem, but the gasket doesn't help much because it's really not sealing the places where leakage occurs: 

The "special" part about the resistor is the design which is intended to be mass-produced and less-subject to failure during manufacturing and use. The key description from the patent is as follows: 

At this point, the only accurate answer is that we don't know for sure. This study indicates that Antarctic ice is increasing overall, while many other studies indicate that it is decreasing. This study used data only from 1992 to 2008, while other papers using more recent have reached the opposite conclusion. Even this study indicates that the rate of ice gain is slowing, and will become a net loss in the future. Robert McSweeny has written a good summary of the recent article, with some comparisons to other studies. The study was done using satellite-based lasers to measure ice thickness over different regions in Antarctica, from 1992 to 2008. The study found that the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) both lost ice during that time, and the East Arctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) accumulated on average about 1 cm of ice. Overall, the study found that there was a net increase of ice. 

It is clear that the cradle-to-grave CO2 emissions are comparable to a conventional vehicle in the most coal-intensive electric grid, and considerably better as the percentage of coal drops. Given that the trend is toward less coal globally, it is clear that the situation will improve from here. The Union of Concerned Scientists report is focused on the United States, and concludes that electric vehicles produce less CO2 than typical conventional vehicles everywhere in the US 

this is a link to a This Old House recommendation to use copper strips, or shingles containing copper granules to prevent algae growth on roofs. 

The paper does not claim that that 97% of scientists endorse AGW. The study was conducted to evaluate the consensus within the published literature, and it found that an overwhelming percentage of published papers expressing a view on the question do endorse the premise that human activity is causing global warming. 

Second, there is some truth in the chart. There is a known discrepancy between tropical tropospheric temperature predictions and observations. This has been recognized for years, so it's nothing new. There's some discussion here which explains the issue and sums it up by saying it's not clear whether it's caused by inaccuracies in the models, inaccuracies in the temperature data, or some combination of the two: 

For photovoltaic systems using current technology, the US Department of Energy's National Renewable energy Lab (NREL) says it takes 3 to 4 years to recover the embodied energy, and specifically states: 

In summary, this is one of many studies on the subject, and more work will be needed to fully answer the question. It does not, however, contradict any of the key findings of climate science. 

Yes, it is more efficient than just tealights, though still a very small source of heat. You note that "all heaters are 100% efficient." This is partially true - all heaters convert virtually all input energy into heat, thus achieving near 100% efficiency. However, if that heat simply rises to the ceiling by convection it doesn't do much to warm the room or its occupants. Radiant heat flows directly from the source to people and objects in the room, and is much more effective as noted in Wikipedia: 

When scientific findings are summarized in the popular press, things often get a bit distorted. The key finding of the referenced paper is given as the last sentence of the abstract: 

This system appears to be a more effective way to heat than an open candle flame, because the flame heats the clay pot, which radiates the heat to the room. The total heat input is still very small, however, as noted below. The design can be viewed as a much smaller and simplified version of a masonry fireplace. A normal fireplace is very inefficient because most of the heat is carried up the chimney by convection. As noted here, 

He did not make it clear in the post that he's focusing on this single value. While people who are knowledgeable in the field will notice what's being plotted, he's implicitly suggesting that predicted temperature increases are consistently much higher than observations, which is not true. Without speculating on whether this is intentional, he is certainly aware that many people will see (and share) the chart as-is, without understanding what it's truly saying. A more global comparison clearly shows the models are working quite well: 

Some of these papers may have stated a position within the body of the paper, but the study only looked at the abstract. Many others may not have stated a position at all, as the purpose of the paper was to report on some particular new finding in the climate science field, rather than to point out that the climate is changing due to human activities. New papers published in the thermal sciences field don't include an explicit endorsement of the laws of thermodynamics. 

As to the papers that did not endorse or deny the existence of AGW, the paper offers this explanation: 

This question can be answered using a Life Cycle Analysis, which looks at emissions over the total life cycle of a product - including manufacture, use, and disposal. Many such studies have been performed, here are two examples: A 2012 UCLA study for the California Air Resources Board, and A 2015 study by The Union of Concerned Scientists Both of these conclude that electric vehicles produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional vehicles using California or US electric mix. From the UCLA study (where BEV means Battery Electric Vehicle, and CV means Conventional Vehicle): 

The Wikipedia article on jet fuel gives an adiabatic flame temperature of 2,230 °C. A source referenced in the Wikipedia article gives a value of 2300 K (2030 °C). The maximum adiabatic flame temperature occurs when the air to fuel ratio is exactly right for complete combustion of the fuel - enough oxygen to completely burn the fuel with none leftover. This is called stoichiometric conditions, or zero excess air. In a large, uncontrolled fire within an enclosed space, it is expected that there will be some regions where the air to fuel ratio is higher and others where it is lower than stoichiometric conditions, and in between these there will be some regions with perfect stoichiometry. Therefore temperatures will not be uniform, but some regions may be very close to the stoichiometric flame temperature.
