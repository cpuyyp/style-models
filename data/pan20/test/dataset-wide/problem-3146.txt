The Wikipedia article sets out the main suspects, including Richard III himself and various allies of his. There were a number of people who claimed, after Richard had died, to be one of the Princes in the Tower, the most famous being Perkin Warbeck, who fought Henry VII for the throne. after Warbeck was captured he confessed under torture that he had made this up. Another pretender, Lambert Simnel, initially claimed to be one of the Princes but changed that for the Earl of Warwick, who had another claim on the throne. 

Just to expand on the disease angle, at its height, Zambia's population was 3% European. In contrast, Nigeria's European population was only 0.04% with West Africa in general described as "white man's grave" due to the large number of deaths caused by yellow fever and malaria. Even within Africa you can see the dramatic difference. 

The Tribal Hidage set out the number of households living in different kingdoms and sub-kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England. Has any work been done to map this data, in particular comparing it to the detailed records of the Domesday Book or other detailed censuses closer to the time? In particular I'm interested in the smaller "Middle Angle" tribes mentioned such as the Gifle, Hicca and Willa. 

Bahadur Shah Zafar breathed his last at 5 a.m. on the morning of Friday, 7 November 1862. He used to live in confinement in Rangoon under the supervision of Captain Nelson Davies with his two wives(Begum Zeenat Mahal and Begum Taj Mahal) and sons(Mirza Jawan Bakht by Begum Zeenat Mahal and Mirza Shah Abbas by one of Zafar's concubines Mubarak un- Nissa) and daughter in law Nawab Shah Zamani Begum ( married to Mirza Jawan Bakht). After Zafar's demise his family were allowed to leave the prison enclosure and to settle somewhere in the Rangoon cantonment in 1867. Begum Zeenat Mahal died in 1882 and was buried in Rangoon near Zafar's final resting place. Mirza Jawan Bakht died in 1884 due to a severe stroke and followed Zeenat Mahal into the grave aged 42 years. Mirza Shah Abbas married a daughter of a Muslim merchant of Rangoon, his descendants still live in Rangoon today. There's a good probability that descendants of Jawan Bakht and Shah Zamani Begum might have survived and have been living in Rangoon. Zafar had 16 sons and 31 daughters. Though fate of his sons is known but those of his daughters is largely unknown. 

As for the American Civil War goes, the first executions for desertion were held on August 19, 1862. 

The only two sources that are recognized to have been written by St Patrick are his "Confessio" and the "Epistola ad Coroticum". Any other writings about St Patrick or written by St patrick are of dubious origin or date. 

Here is a video if Pope John XXIII blessing the Agnus Dei in 1959: Pope Blessing Angus Dei (YouTube). 

Very little is known about the childhood of Charlemagne. There is no reason to believe that he was not baptized with any other name than that of Charles (Karl). In fact, we are not even sure as where he was born. 

Crusaders are sometimes called "Latins" because they were of the Roman Catholic Church and used Latin as their liturgical and scholarly language. 

The Agnus Dei would be one form of talisman that Catholics would keep on their person as a form of protection. Nevertheless Catholics would call it a sacramental. 

Except for religion, there was nothing common between the two wings. The Bengalis' language, culture, dress, food habits and their very way of life was different from that of the West Pakistani. The economies of the two wings had a different basis, and the west Pakistan, having held political sway, exploited the eastern wing's economic resources for the benefit of the western wing. For example, the jute and tea which was grown in East Pakistan earned most of the country's foreign exchange but the major portion of it was used to develop the western wing. On 13 Nov 1970, a cyclone in east Pakistan claimed 2 million lives. The more populous East Pakistan was denied protection from floods which brought periodic devastation of life and property. To suppress the voice of dissent, Rehman was tried for conspiracy. In his broadcast to the nation on 26 March 1971, Yahya Khan charged Rehman with treason, and India was blamed for allegedly aiding and abetting the same. Unable to bear injustice any longer, the Bengalis took to the streets to seek a solution for their continued oppression. On 7 March 1971, Rehman announced his willingness to participate in the session of the National Assembly provided his four demands-withdrawal of martial law, return of troops to their barracks, inquiry into army killings, and transfer of power to duly elected representatives of the people- were met before the start of the session. He also outlined a weeklong programme of non cooperation to cripple the army regime. Therefore, long before India intervened and acted as a catalyst to liberate Bangladesh, so overwhelming was the response to Sheikh Mujibur Rehman's call that he had virtually become the rulers of East Pakistan. Yahya Khan appointed General Tikka Khan as Governor of East Pakistan for the task of bringing Rehman to heel. Tikka Khan started to suppress the rebellion by imprisoning the Awami League leaders, suspending political activities and finally carrying out mass genocide of the Bengali intellectuals resulting in fleeing of Bengalis to neighbouring India. As the number of refugees grew in number (about 10 million), it became a massive task for the authorities to cater for their food and lodging arrangements, which was already a massive burden on the weak Indian economy( in 1971). In April 1971, the then PM Mrs Indira Gandhi decided and told the Army Chief Gen Manekshaw to invade into East Pakistan, which was denied by him stating that the international support is not with the country and his army is not ready both equipment/weapon wise and strength wise. So, it was decided to attack in Dec 1971 so as to minimise threat from China as well. Initially India's plan was to free as much territory in then East Pakistan so that all the refugees could return to their country, but the low morale and confusion and lack of coordination amongst the Pakistani troops lead to capture of Dhaka in just 14 days. 

England at the time had a fairly widespread system of parish registers, which recorded the christenings, marriages and burials of many people, although it was a bit patchy at first. You can search a good selection of the records at the website www.famlysearch.org. I've just done that and seen that the frequency of first names from births from 1485 to 1603 as listed below. The simple answer to your question is no, Charles and Edward in particular were fairly uncommon although Thomas was popular. Other popular names included John and William. Feel free to try out more names and edit this answer to add them in! All males - 1,070,420 - $URL$ Thomas: 128,129 - $URL$ Charles: 2,266 Edward: 25,973 Note Charles was only really introduced to England after the Stuart kings started to rule in the 1600s. by comparison: George - 24,455 Richard - 54,803 William - 65,587 Robert - 37,590 Norman - 5 Christopher - 5,607 Andrew - 2,143 Luke - 563 John - 178,778 James - 18,206 Oliver - 814 Henry - 20,161 

Jacopo Riccati was an Italian mathematician and jurist from Venice. He is best known for having studied the equation (Riccati equation) which bears his name. As you mentioned in your question, Riccati was educated by the Jesuits. His son Vincenzo Ricca actually became a Jesuit. It would be safe to say that Riccati had close ties to this Religious Order most his life and was undoubtedly a faithful Catholic. That taken into consideration, there are several different things to be noted about the cover illustration of the book. First of all Riccati was a mathematician and one can notice objects in the lower left hand corner that suggest he was indeed well educated. In the middle is A woman holding a object that is emitting rays of light and in the other a branch of some sort. This particular woman, is probably a martyr (and one whom Riccati had a particular devotion to). The branch in her left hand looks like a palm branch a Christian symbol of martyrdom. In her right hand, she is holding up what appears to be an artist rendition of a monstrance.It Could be note here that Jesuits make there solemn profession in before the Blessed Sacrament while in a monstrance. It is also the symbol of the Jesuit Order.
