The French imprisoned both Pius VI and Pius VII. You should be able to find plenty of hits during the "pornocracy" between 867â€“1049 CE. Leo V was imprisoned by an antipope. John X was imprisoned at the height of the pornocracy as was poor Benedict VI. John IV was another unfortunate who was imprisoned by an antipope. Then there's infamous Formosus who, one could opine, was incarcerated within his coffin until he was exhumed, placed on trial, found guilty, thrown into a river, recovered, reburied, re-exhumed, re-tried, found guilty, beheaded, and so on. 

To summarise, Roman publicani via portitores levied customs duties during import as well as transit which, at different points in time, were anywhere between 2.5% to 12.5% of the value of the goods. All goods were taxed including slaves. Some exemptions were made with respect to personal luxuries. I expect that World History of the Customs and Tariffs by Hironori Asakura will have oodles of information on this subject. 

Assuming that the steel is already available, I think that it might be safe to extrapolate that a cheap but functional Japanese sword could have been made in a few days, a good sword in a couple of weeks or more, and a great sword in a month or more. 

I'd curious to know how and when the word diablo came to mean the Devil. In Luc Ferry's A Brief History of Thought, he states: 

According to "Logistics of Warfare in the Crusades", Ibn Battuta noted the use of personal water-skins in the ninth century: 

As noted above, the "man of great worth" reference is from the Old Testament's Kings (which is in itself suggestive): 

A resulting map from 1507 which is often credited as the source for the name America looked like this: 

Do we have knowledge on the number of vessels in the armadas of the various belligerents of the Napoleonic wars? Information on the types of boats, captured vessels, and sunk vessels will also be nice. 

The above excerpts suggest that monks/scribes were indeed put out of work albeit gradually and not completely. There was opposition to the loss of jobs from economic, philosophical, and theological perspectives and there might have also been a strike in Paris by scribes to protest the newfangled innovation. 

But what does "from Ecclesiastical Gk. diabolos, in Jewish and Christian use" actually mean? Also, was it imported by Ecclesiastical Greek when the word meant, as Ferry suggests, "the who who divides", or the Wiktionary meaning of "slanderer". Or did the word already represent the Devil by then? Also, when did this happen? 

Columbus and everybody else at the time believed that he had discovered the Eastern shores of Asia. Vespucci was one of those amongst the everybody else. An essay by Jonathan Cohen titled, The Naming of America: Fragments we've shored against ourselves, covers the naming of America in some detail. In it, Cohen notes: 

They are two lions argent supporting the Royal Arms which also sports a lion. That said, Edward IV's list of approved badges includes a Wolf argent (of Mortimer). His grandmother was Anne de Mortimer. 

Firstly, is this list accurate? Secondly, what was the purpose of this practice? Was it simply vanity? Did he also found or rename other places based on the names of, say, his parents, wives, or generals? (I suppose that he did name one town after his horse, Bucephalus.) 

(Furthermore, in 512, the citizens of Constantinople openly wanted Olybrius' father, Aerobindus, to be their emperor (thanks to Anastasius' religious muddling). This goes to show what a distinguished family he belonged to.) Considering that consuls are appointed for a one-year term, presumably it was easier to control a ten-year old than an adult in the first year of Anastasius' reign. It is telling that no second consul was appointed and that Anastasius himself became consul the next year. (Incidentally, his grandfather, Ancius Olybrius, was also chosen as a puppet ruler. This might also have been a favourable trait.) As for whether this was a custom or a one-off, it was very likely the latter. As mentioned above, Anastasius himself was consul the next year and, at the age of 62, he was no spring chicken. Looking at the biographies of other consuls of the time cements this view. 

Using ORBIS which reconstructs travel through the Roman Empire circa 200CE as a basis, a fast carriage across ~700kms (I chose Naples to Verona) would have taken about 10 days. A horse relay team between the same cities only took 3.6 days to cover 763 kms. One could use these numbers as a rule of thumb for all pre-industrial travel on decent roads. That said, I dare say that travelling down the Danube would have been preferable to the road. Again, as per ORBIS, river transport would shorten the journey between Regensburg (Castra Regina) to Vienna (Vindobona), a distance of ~440 km, from between 4 (military) to 7 days in 200CE. Depending on whether it was a courier delivering a message to a diplomat travelling himself, it might be reasonable to estimate that the journey between Berlin and Vienna might have taken anywhere between 3 and 10 days. (Although ORBIS does take a lot of factors into account, this answer does not account for either political and geographical roadblocks or technological improvements in 1770s Europe. It's simply an educated guesstimate.) 

The modern sense is reasonably well known. Wikipedia's entry for robber baron notes that the term robber knight is also used. In other words, robber knights certainly did exist. The wiki notes that they were a significant issue during the Hundred Years War which did cover parts of the 15th century. Robber barons was an epithet that was assigned to those who preyed primarily on the river traffic on the Rhine. They became something of a virus during the interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire during the 13th century. 

Much of this information has been gleaned from Vespucci's letters to his sponsors (also published as Mundus Novus, i.e., New World) where he provides the how he knew that it was not Asia and was instead a new continent that he had discovered: 

In 6 CE, Augustus, possibly building on Crassus' idea, organised a group of slaves into the Vigiles, a force which functioned both as firefighters as well as policemen of Rome: 

Kubaba or Kug-bau is said to have been a Sumerian ruler circa 2500 BCE and possibly the oldest rags-to-riches story that we know of: she was an alewife/tavern-keeper before she became queen. 

I have not watched the documentary. However, going by Jared Diamond's book of the same name, I would be surprised if it claimed that the Incans capitulated because they believed that the conquistadores were gods. Quoting from the book: 

As we are told repeatedly when trying to find out about Pythagoras' life, very little is reliably known about it. A lot of later sources use his travels to explain his various influences and tend to crowbar countries into his itinerary for this reason. For example, Egypt and Babylon are often stated to have influenced his geometry, mysticism and secrecy, while Babylon and India opened his eyes to vegetarianism, and India, some say, introduced him to vedic mathematics and Buddhism. One can't help but be sceptical of such explanations. That said, my question is simple: does Laertius' Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers actually mention Arabia, Judaea, and/or "even India"? 

The page also contends that the production of steel from iron would take four or five workers at least a week. It also goes on to mention that, depending on the quality of the sword, the polisher might take weeks to get things done just right: 

Wikipedia's page on Japanese swordsmithing provides some information on the time frames involved in the manufacture of good quality blades: 

Egypt did not recognise Israel as a country until 1979. Till then, it effectively considered Israel to be enemy-occupied Palestine. (A number of Muslim-majority countries still do.) Consequently, it did not deem Israeli shipping to be legitimate and therefore contended that the blockade did not contravene any agreements. Israeli shipping in the Suez had been blocked by Egypt on and off ever since the partition. King Farouk pointedly ignored a UN resolution ordering the reopening of the canal in the 1951. Egypt blocked shipping in both the Suez and the Straits of Tiran during the Six-day war as well. 

In summary, the question of why gunpowder made its way to Europe can very likely be blamed on its use in warfare. The how, on the other hand, is sketchy as, based on these sources, both the Mongols and the Arabs, or both, might have introduced it to the "Ferenghi" on the battlefield. 

As highlighted in the above excerpt, robber barons became a real problem only when there was no real authority to question them. Furthermore, they holed themselves up in highly fortified castles or castle-towns which were sometimes on an island in the middle of the Rhine. They were consequently not an easy target to deal with and required a concerted effort to bring down. The Baron of Rietberg appears to have been a famous robber baron as, according to Google, were those of Katzenelnbogen, Reichenstein, Sooneck, and Ehrenfels. It is unknown whether any of these robber barons were active during the 15th century. 

Cited source: Burnet J. (1892) Early Greek Philosophy A. & C. Black, London SEP's page on Anaxagoras has this note: 

At least some of the monks viewed their work as drudgery. From The Hall of Light: A Study of Early Chinese Kingship by William Edward Soothill, Dorothea Lady Hosie, G. F. Hudson (in a chapter on the transmission and translation of the Bible): 

All the sources I've perused can, just as Wikipedia does, only surmise on the how and why gunpowder made its way to Europe. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology offers a nutshell overview of the possible routes that might have been taken: 

The mismanagement of the Chinese Qing empire between the years of 1820 and 1913 is plain to see. Similarly, assuming that colonialism satisfies the OP's criteria, the difference in percentage GDP of (British) India between 1700 and 1940 is simply astounding. 

A New York bar's website is one of a few sites which provide the following (seemingly) credible explanation for this practice: 

The Wikipedia article on Roman military personal equipment suggests that each legionnaire carried a water-skin: 

For the record, in terms of modern sporting events, the earliest recorded international sporting event is said to be a cricket match which was played between the United States of America versus the British Empire's Canadian Province in 1844: 

Unfortunately, the snippet does not extend beyond this. (I'm uncertain if all the scribes of the era were monks. I can't easily imagine monks going on strike.) A blog by a Dr. Richard Scott Nokes, professor of medieval literature at Troy University addresses this question and offers a slightly contrary opinion: 

Although the dates do not really conform to the Mongol defeat of the Chinese in an earlier excerpt, in "Firearms: A Global History to 1700", Kenneth Chase suggests that the Mongols were the ones who brought gunpowder westward: 

That said, a Dr. Guangqiu Xu in "China at War" provides a persuasive answer to both the how and the why: 

Another blog by a David Malki! points to Johannes Trithemius, a fifteenth century abbot who, presumably in a supervisory capacity, believed that drudgery was good for the soul. He, 

Viracocha, the creator-god of the Incas If Pizarro and his minions were mistaken for Viracocha, it is usually ascribed to their use of primitive guns with loud bangs (thunder), flashes of gunpowder (lightning) and the accompanying destruction. This might have impressed the natives as being similar to the thunderbolts in Viracocha's hands. The mounted Spaniards also wore shiny steel chain mail and helmets and brandished tough steel swords. These and other factors also mentioned by Diamond could only have aided this notion: 

A number of sources (such as this one) claim that this statement was made in 1838 (which would have been a difficult feat as he would have been dead for 26 years by then). Wikiquote claims that there is no way to verify by whom, when or why it was made. It notes: 

While it is difficult to understand what the monks themselves thought on this matter, there is some material on whether they enjoyed their work, were actually put out of work and if there were protests against the printing press due to this. From: From Gutenberg to the Internet: A Sourcebook on the History of Information Technology, Volume 2 by Jeffrey M. Norman: 

The above is just one of seemingly myriad translations. Solomon's son and successor was Rehoboam. So I guess there's an element of proximity at play as well. (There might be something in the fact that these names are taken from the book, Kings, as well as the fact that all of them were, along with a number of others in the list, all kings. Even Balthazar and Melchior of the Magi are apparently considered to have been kings.) 

Considering that the Samurai class had its distant roots in Chinese political structure, did China or Korea have a similar warrior class? 

I'm curious to know if any official honours (not restricted only to citizenships), awards, or decorations were granted to Hitler outside Germany. 

The Vigiles were commanded by a Praefectus vigilum (Prefect of the Watch) who was appointed by the emperor. Some sources state that Augustus was inspired to create the Vigiles based on the innovative use of water pumps to combat fires in Egypt. There do not appear to have been any organised civil emergency services such as paramedics until the 19th century. While flooding was an issue in the Nile valley, I suspect that it was too regular to have necessitated an emergency service. While Japanese earthquakes and tsunamis were meticulously recorded, there again do not appear to have been any dedicated emergency services to provide relief during disasters. 

The Arab-Crusades theory is bolstered by the fact that gunpowder was initially known simply as black-powder or more suggestively, as Saracen powder: 

Considering some of the questions/questioners that have cropped up recently on this site, what was the Nazi attitude towards India and specifically the Aryans of India? Did Hitler consider them to be just as superior as the Nordic race? Did this perhaps motivate his support of the Indian National Army during WW2? 

How were heavier objects weighed in antiquity or the middle ages? Were balances simply scaled up in size with appropriately larger weights? Did people know how much an elephant or even an ox actually weighed? 

FranÃ§ois Bonal does appear to be an expert on Champagne and has written a number of books on its history. The stated explanation was very likely taken from his book, Le livre d'or du champagne (1984). A similar theory is proposed by a columnist in an Alabama newspaper:
