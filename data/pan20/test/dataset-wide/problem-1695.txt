Backups per continent in the server and a separate S3 instance and the worse case scenario the dev-server is the final backup. Now, think an image folder like a big "image-basket". So, how can the "image-basket" be commonly attached to EVERY website? All the servers will use (i think it would do the trick easy) per 15to30mins in case to re-syncronize themselves for core files like the "HTML/CSS files etc." Do I have a big overhead here? Is there any other solution to "keep the servers updated all the time" ? Of course, one will be the primary, and as I believe the major-first-primary server will be the developer server that hosts the essentials like administration panels etc. So, after the "push" the dev-server will "push" or "rsync" everything to all the three Regions-servers. As you can understand, it is going to be a huge issue if I "rsync" the /image/ folder. We have to talk about 500+ /image/ folders of aprx. (right now) 20 GB each. So we need 500*20GB = 10.000GB extra for the images.. This is not a case as you can understand. 1) One "dirty" solution might be, to host in one server all the images, and every website using an HTTP request to get the correct images. Pretty bad solution because you might DDos your own application in high volume traffic hours. 2) In my opinion and point of view, the /image/ folder has to be in a separate instance or "whatever-is-that", to be used rapidly on every single server, in other words, to every single website. Is there any service out there that can be bind 3 at least webserver in different regions? I didn't find anything close to that yet. At least, do you think any solution for the "sharing-image-basket" issue? There was a question with something similar: Reliable file sharing but as I see and understand, his case is different. UPDATE-Clarifications 1) A request for (e.g.) /image/foo.png should always return the same file regardless of which site is being accessed, and regardless of which region. 2) What are the geographic references of the regions: 3 different continents. So, three different "private networks" if we are talking about Digital Ocean, or three different VPCs if we are talking about AWS, etc. 3) How much traffic is there: Traffic is not related to the solution. Think a big increasing volume of traffic and requests. It doesn't make sense to have a solution for low traffic and when the traffic is double+ to "design it" or trying to upgrade the CPU/RAM/STORARE-GB. That's why I propose "local" load balancer for a region, with a "replica" machine to distribute and bypass the big volume of traffic. 

I am getting these two error in the DNS Event log (errors at end of question). I have confirmed I do have duplicate zones. I am wondering which ones to delete. The DomainDNSZone contains all of our DNS records but it does not have the _msdcs zone.... that is in the ForestDNSZone with the duplicates that are not in use. 3 Questions. I understand the advantages of having DNS in the ForestDNSZone. so... 

I have 3 servers 1 production 1 standby and 1 just sitting there. I want 1 to stay production and I have been working on setting up an MSSQL automatic failover cluster between the production server and the standby server. I require a witness server and an active directory. My question is: Can I install the MSSQL witness server on a Domain Controller? If not, WHY? This would allow me to NOT virtualize or purchase a fourth machine. Has anyone done this in a production environment? 

Is this possible? Will we just be blocked again? (let's assume we are not sending out spam on the secondary server and IP) How can I accomplish moving the users from one exchange to the other. Moving mailboxes takes a LONG time. Both exchange servers are on site (physically beside each other) With email reputation as heavily weighted as it is. Is it reasonable to expect email sent from the secondary IP to reach the users Inbox? 

Well, I found the solution that works perfectly. It uses a simple Logon script, so Avery Payne, one might say you were at least partially right :) Outlook (2003 and later, don't know about earlier versions) allows importing the profile info through PRF file. It is a plain text file, so you can write it from scratch, or preferably - export it from existing profile and edit as needed. I used the second variant. I downloaded Office Resource Kit - I was exporting PRF file from 2003 version, so I downloaded Outlook 2003 version (ORK.EXE, download it here). Installed it and got the Custom Installation Wizard, which enables you to export existing profile to PRF file. Needless to say, you first need to configure a working profile on the PC you're exporting from. After successful export, I edited the PRF file to lose unnecessary stuff and to generalize some settings with Windows variables, so that I get user specific info after the PRF file is imported: 

SITUATION: A larger company acquires a smaller one. IT infrastructure has to be merged. There are no immediate plans to change the current size or role of the smaller company - the offices and production remain. It has a Win 2003 SBS domain server, Win 2000 file server, linux server for SVN and internal Wikipedia, 2 or 3 production machines, LTO backup solution. The servers are approx. 5 years old. Cisco network equippment (switches, wireless, ASA). Mail solution is a hosted Exchange. There are approx. 35 desktops and laptops in the company. IT infrastructure unification: There are 2 IT merging proposals. 1.) Replacing old servers, installing Win Server 2008 domain controller, and setting up either subdomain or domain trust to a larger company. File server and other servers remain local and synchronization should be set up to a centralized location in larger company. Similary with the backup - it remains local and if needed it should be replicated to a centralized location. Licensing is managed by smaller company. 2.) All servers are moved to a centralized location in larger company. As many desktop machines as possible are replaced by thin clients. The actual machines are virtualized and hosted by Terminal server at the same central location. Citrix solutions will be used. Only router and site-2-site VPN connection remain at the smaller company. Backup internet line to insure near 100% availability is needed. Licensing is mainly managed by larger company. Only specialized software for PCs that will not be virtualized is managed by smaller company. I'd like to ask you to discuss both solutions a bit. In your opinion, which is better from the operational point of view? Which is more reliable, cheaper in the long run? Easier to manage from the system administrator's point of view? Easier on the budget and easier to maintain from IT department's point of view? Does anybody have any experience with the second option and how does it perform in production environment? Pros and cons of both? Your input will be of great significance to me. Thank you very much! 

Thanks for everyone's input! Been a great looking glass into your configurations at your companies and your thoughts about wifi and its security. Ended up just leaving it. We just don't have enough visitors to justify publishing the password. Additionally some users bring in laptops and I would like them to be able to access the domain without a VPN. If this becomes an issue I will buy another wireless router and set it up on its own network and publish the connection information. 

What should I keep in mind when moving the computers back to the proper OU? What should I keep in mind when moving the other objects such as users and distrobution and security groups outside of the Domain Controller OU's child OU? 

The back story is that Server 1 (the Primary DC and Global Catalog server) was originally just a WSUS and ACT (Act is like Sales Force) server. Basically a non essential system. We had a disaster and the only option was to upgrade that server to become the Primary DC and GC Server. I do like the hardware on the machine and our current configuration, but feel it should be setup properly if we are going to rely on it. I would like to know step by step what actions must be taken to reformat the machine. Can I retain the same computer name? Do I have to demote the server and promote the backup DC (Server 3) then reformat then promote Server 1 back to Primary DC and GC? I am not worried about the services on the machine as those will be easy to move to another server. It is mainly the Domain Controller function that I am curious about the proper steps for this sort of project. Anything I am missing here please let me know and I will update. Thanks, 

I have a standalone Win 2003 server with Windows Sharepoint Services (WSS3) running on it. I had to rename the server and I had bunch of problems resulting from this. Note that the server is not in AD environment. I fixed the problems with Sharepoint (directly related to a rename) by using steps 1 & 3 from this site (TNX) Nevertheless, there are still strange references to old server name all over the place: in registry, in Windows Internal database, in Sharepoint Central Administration... Most disturbing problem is that Sharepoint isn't able to send email notifications to participants. This is IMO due to the fact, that Simple Mail Transfer Protocol service is still "answering" with old server name. When I try to telnet locally to the mail server (SMTP), I get a response: 

Next, I attached script to OU Group policy and voila! I wrote Instructions for users, and still helping some to finish setting up the profile. Still much easier as manually configuring all clients. Anyway, the following site was crucial for my breakthru, so it deserves to be linked here: Pay them a visit Thanks to Matthew, his post pointed me in right direction. 

I imagine that since actual server name and apparent email domain are different, sending mail is somehow considered open relay and actual message goes to void. Anyway, does anyone have an idea, how to fix discrepancies with name or how to fix SMTP server name? TNX! 

If unfreeze didn't work did you try to force? Try this: Open Exchange System Manager: First Administrative Group > Servers> "Server Name" > Queues Right click the queue in question and click Force Connection. It could fail for a few reason Message size to large recipient doesn't exist or is unreachable domain does not exists or is unreachable etc... You can click find messages and search for it. If there is only one that will make it easy. Check out the properties see if that sheds some light on it. 

Useful shelf life of a system-state backup of Active Directory Quote from the link about Tombstone Lifetime. 

I use WSUS for the same purpose. I setup WSUS to download updates. Grouped the computers into "Workstations" and "Servers" then I setup in the domains group policy where the client machines get their updates. Seems like this is what you want to do. If you ever need to change the update server or how the clients are getting their updates you just simply modify the GPO. Here is the location: GPO Domain Policy Expand: Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Update You should configure all that apply, but the specific GPO you must set is: "Specify intranet Microsoft Update Service Location" Here is where you can specify your WSUS server. Hope this helps. 

Was moving around some AD objects and accidentally clicked the "Do not show this warning again" For moving AD objects... I like this warning as it is a final step to confirm that I actually want to perform this operation. Anyone know how to reenable the warning? Could not find that inside any options 

I would your suggestions for an effective solution for a person, who needs to access resources in two Windows domains and wants to use one computer. It's about our CEO, who has accepted a second position in another company. Accessing files and folders isn't big problem. The greatest challenge I see is that he wants to conveniently access Exchange accounts in both companies; he would like to send and receive mail in single Outlook if possible (two profiles?) There is also a challenge with calendars: he would like to have one calendar for all activities from both Exchange accounts. Creating a POP3 account for accessing second Exchange server is a last resort, because obviously there is a problem with scheduling meetings and other calendar related tasks. Forwarding and receiving all mail/tasks on primary Exchange server is inconvenient because simple replying to original sender is disabled; and also when manually changing the recepient, he will receive mail from the wrong address. We were considering Virtualisation, that is setting up an instance of virtual machine inside existing installation and then joining this virtual computer to a second domain. Then installing another MS Outlook. This would of course mean two different Outlook accounts, two different calendars, but would at least enable our CEO to access all information from a single laptop. Does anyone have any other idea? I know setting up two domains on a single computer is a no-go (without much hacking at least), but effective workarounds are appreciate. The thing I am looking here is high usage/efficiency/productivity, but also as elegant solution from the administration point of view. Thank you very much (if you managed to read this through, this is a good sign ^_^ ) 

I came across an AD today where the previous admin had set it up in where every AD object is in a child OU of Domain Controllers.......... 

Just fyi when I look in those folders from the ForestDNSZone they have just 2 and 1 entries respectively. So obviously not in use compared to the others. I am pretty sure I understand the steps to complete this. But if you would like to provide that info, bonus points! 

When done for mulitple users by replacing "Kerry" with $($_.Alias) it only works for some users. Other get double or more copies of the rule, while other users do not get it at all..... Very strange. What could I be missing here? 

Simply put you must activate the mirror from the principal server in the High Safety mode without automatic fail over. This method is great for planned outages and maintenance. It is not really beneficial in a disaster or unplanned downtime scenario as you cannot fail over without access to the principal server. I use a very low cost old computer running MSSQL express as the monitor server. It has windows XP pro on it. I am sure you can find a small computer to carry out the task of the monitor server. Something that can meet minimum requirements for MSSQL express will do fine. Hope this helps. 

I would look at Windows Small Business Server. Then see if you qualify for the Microsoft Bizspark program. This also could be done with a Linux distribution though the skilled Admin required for that role and configuration if Linux is outside of your scope may be more in costs than just purchasing of the SBS from MS which is simple enough that a low level Adm1n would not have much issue configuring. On the Point of Sale System (POS) that would be to run the back end database correct? What software does that DB use? That may be a consideration before jumping on Linux especially if it utilizes MSSQL...
