Back Stretches - The muscle gets stiff after being inactive in a chair all day, stretches help increase blood flow and also release of lactic acid after workouts. 

Judging by your height and weight, you seem like you require a more beginners approach to weight lifting and power lifting is not recommended. Since you dont have a solid base, it will be very tough for you to mantain a proper form. I recommend you to start using machines for all the mentioned exercises, the machines prevent unwanted injuries and also help mantain your form, work on the free weights only with an instructor spotting you and looking out for your form. Slowly progress increasing your strength and know your limits, as excessive weight can severely harm your back or cause troublesome injuries. 

With your goal of everyday strength, bodyweight exercises are sufficient, provided that you work the right muscles with the right exercises. Here is what i would suggest: Upper body: Buy a set of resistance tubes, they are very affordable and help you work muscles such as the biceps, triceps. Then of course all variations of the pushup, with and without inclination, use furniture or a bed to achieve the desired inclination. Dips for the triceps. Core: core musles comprise of all the muscles between your chest and hip. Core muscles are often ignored but are very important for overall strength, if your core is strong, you have more stability and hence reduced risk for injury due to heavy lifting. I would recommend planks, and various ab workouts. Legs:many people believe that legs cant be workout out without hitting the gym, but there are ways by which you can boost their strength tremendously. Apart from the usual squats and calf raises, Incorporate plyometric exercises, where you jump hard and then jump again as soon as you touch back down... All the variations of the above can give you very satisfactory results. Stay motivated and enjoy your home workouts! 

The marathon itself was at a near-coastal town (Bruges) and 100% on paved roads. I live some 40km from the town and experience the same climate/temperatures. So I was wondering if there are any training techniques/tips which might help my body perform better during warmer days? Does any had the same problem & how did they overcome it? Sidenotes: before any mentions under-training 

Sorry to bother you with this. I had my heart-rate zones measured lately and I know where my Aerobic & Anaerobic thresholds are. The doctor made an in deep explanation what it means. Though I feel i lost him midway the explanation of the training part. It was going way to technical... I know the basics like 70% of the weekly milage below the aerobic thresholh & 30% above the aerobic threshold. And how the plan my my training with warmup/cooldown-parts. I thought i would find the remaining explaination on the net. Though I was wrong, It always seems to be to broad without any real-life examples to work with. So I was hoping you guys might be able to help me. I'm looking for clear (no BS or to much technical mumbo-jumbo) explanation how I should plan my weeks. Something mainly focussed for long distances runners ( half-to-full marathons), so I adjust my training accordingly. I really hope you guys might be able to help me... :( FYI: My weekly training scheme 

So you want something universal, with validations, easily measurable and repeatable as well as measuring endurance and strength. Why not just use standard military training fitness tests? A basic one is the US Army Physical Fitness test, which includes pushups, situps, and a 2-mile run. $URL$ You can also look at some of the US Marine Corps ones, which are slightly different. If this is not broad enough, or is too simple, there are some VERY GOOD special forces ones that I've used in the past. For example, JTF2 (Canadian Special Forces) has one that encompasses the bench press, pullups, pushups, situps, and a 1.5 mile run, with validated scores and all the fun stuff. $URL$ 

First of all, you're not working out the other half of your body...your legs. When you're a natural lifter (no anabolic supplements like 90% of the instagram and gym rat population), the most efficient way to grow is systematically, maybe even the only way. For those not using buckets of steroids, hypertrophy (muscle growth) is not a localized process. For the most part, given sufficient stimulus, muscle growth happens all over your body instead of in one teeny location. As such, doing work that stresses the whole body – putting a big load on the spine that the entire body must support – will cause more growth in your biceps than working the biceps directly. To put it another way, doing heavy trap-bar deadlifts will do more to make your arms bigger than doing curls. A popular rule of thumb in the lifting world states that in order to gain an inch of circumference on your arms, you need to gain about 15 pounds of muscle, and that's pretty much right. Otherwise you'd see guys walking around who trained nothing but biceps and, as a result, were inverse T-Rex types with huge arms and tiny little bodies. But you don't.So Curls Don't Work? Of course they do. A biceps-specific program will surely add some arm size as long as you're doing everything else right, but the results would generally pale in comparison to what you'd get if you did a program that was biased towards the deadlift or some other big, total body movement. Likewise, a biceps-specific program would help if you've been doing the big movements all along but need an area-specific catalyst. Steroids, however, make your whole body ultra-responsive to any kind of mechanical stress. If you're using sufficient quantities of steroids, anything works. All those body part-specific routines issued through countless bodybuilding mags "written" by bodybuilders did us all a huge disservice. They convinced many of us to concentrate on curls, kickbacks, shrugs, anterior delt raises, and leg extensions when we should have spent a lot of that time putting big systemic loads on our spine with compound movements. Now, that's not even really related to the question but I needed to rant. Your ACTUAL problem is, you're not eating enough. It's THAT simple. 2500 calories is just a guideline, a starting point, there's no cookie cutter calorie count to gain mass. If you're eating 2500 cals and you're not growing, ALL you need to do is up your calories, like I can't stress this enough, it is actually that simple...eat MORE, eat 3000 cals. If that doesn't work, eat 3500. If you're having trouble digesting like you say, then just add more liquids to your diet. Make a protein shake with 2 scoops of whey, a banana, cup of milk, peanut butter...that's already over 500 calories, you see where I'm going with this. And last, doing 15 reps won't do much for muscle growth, ESPECIALLY when you are natty. You need to be periodizing your training in order to take advantage of all the different kinds of hypertrophy stimilus possible. You need to add in a few weeks of heavy lifting on the compound movements, 5-6 sets of 3-6 reps. Then some pure bodybuilding work of 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps with moderate weights. Then you can do a week of light weights for 15 reps, but that's just for metabolic stress. If you want mass, stick to the 6-12 rep range and lift heavy. 

I've just completed my first marathon last sunday. It was pretty much a global disaster. I started cramping up at the 18km (11mile) mark before completely comming to a halt at km 31 (19.5 miles). I finished in around 5hours. Way beyond the 4h mark which was (based on my training) calculated as expected finishing time (=my long run training tempo). In the end I wasn't tired(=which frustrated me), I just had cramps all over the place. As I trained thoroughly for 6 months completing no less then 7 times a 20milers without feeling any exhaustion/cramps. One of the reasons of my failure was the warm day I believe (next to me being nervous). It was 26°C (78,8 F) at its warmest. And I tend to fail/cramp up during warmer weather. I've tried pretty much every trick in the book: 

I'm a runner and I currently run about 35-40 miles per week. Recently I was giving the possibility to commute to work twice a week using the bike. I would be given $0.30 for every ridden mile from to work. Work is about 12 miles away on a reasonably fat terrain. I love to bike, yet i'm worried that this commute might have a negative impact on my running performance? Does anyone have any studies/personal experiences on the combination of running & bike commute? Kind Regards & thank you for the input. 

I used to hear the same from my parents and grandparents when I was around your age. "That powder stuff can't be good for you", "it's gonna make you fat", "it's like doping, stop taking it", "you're gonna get kidney stones"...you get the point. I think it's important that you don't just come to a site like this and blindly follow the answers we give you but that you actually understand the entire process, and understand the logic and reason it for yourself. I'll state some facts first, give you my opinion, and you can reach the conclusion by yourself. If you do not believe the things I say, let me know in the comments and I'll also post a few articles/journals but I'm gonna keep it relatively "technical term friendly" so you can understand. First of all, you must understand how one can actually stunt their growth in the first place. The most common reason seems to be due to inadequate nutrition. Think about it, if you don't eat your vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, what is your body going to use to build it self to be bigger and stronger? Nothing. It's similar to trying to build a house with no bricks or wood, how are you going to build it ? You simply can't. Note that this is also usually seen at very early ages, as in anywhere from birth until around 7-8. Since you haven't had stunted growth so far, it's pretty safe you have had good (at least not horrible) nutrition to date. Since you sound like a healthy teenager (no serious diseases) we can rule out serious immune system deficiency from birth, and thus you are fine in that regard as well. Now the most common other causes of stunted growth are due to genetics, serious illnesses, complications during your birth, and now my favourite one, and one that EVERYONE will mess up, is due to your hormones. The hormone part of the above, is where basically every single parent gets their myths from. You see, back in the day, when my parents were just teenagers, they used to watch the olympics and olympic weightlifting. One common theme between all the weightlifters were that they were very short athletes, at least compared to some of the other athletes in the olympics. Throughout the years, wives tale after wives tale later, people somehow reached the conclusion that these weightlifters are short since they lift heavy weights. Now, what's one of the most common things associated with lifting weights ? Supplementing with protein! As another example, if you look at the bodybuilders of the 80s-90s, they are all rather average height, or shorter (with the exception of Arnold). What do bodybuilders eat to get bigger and stronger? Protein! The truth is, whey protein is just a supplement. It is similar to those Flinstones vitamins that we used to take as kids. When we can't get enough nutrients from our daily food (diet) alone, we turn to supplements such as whey protein, vitamins, fish oils, in order to. You know what else has a lot of whey protein ? MILK! That's a bit ironic isn't it? But don't we hear that drinking milk will make our bones stronger and make us grow? But how can that be if milk is just a mix of whey and casein protein? Well...as I'm sure you've understood by now, taking whey protein (or ANY proper supplement for that reason), provides your body with extra nutrients that you can't get from your diet..so, if anything, whey protein HELPS with growth. Think about it , how could something that gives you extra nutrients possibly make you stop growing? As for where the myth comes from, as I was mentioning above, bodybuilders and weightlifters have generally been short athletes, and at least back where I'm from (Eastern Europe), all the parents will believe that lifting weights stunts growth, as a result since protein is tied to lifting weights, it gets a bad rep among people who just refuse to think...granted they are just worried about their children. The ACTUAL reason for why these athletes are short are due to many things and noone can narrow it down to just one thing. I know for a FACT, that many weightlifters (especially the pros) will start supplementing with anabolic steroids from their teenage years when they are still growing. Now, remember how I said hormones play a huge role in growth? Well anabolic steroids are the grandfather of hormonal supplements, and they will cause your hormones to be very irregular and unbalanced. This is because, when you take steroids, youre injecting yourself with extra hormones. Your body, accordingly thinks, "hmmm, well if I already have all these extra hormones, I should stop producing my own", and so it stops your natural supply of hormones. And as a result, if used improperly, your body never really recovers, and your growth slows down greatly.There's ALOT more that goes on in this process, but this is enough for the sake of arguement. The next time your parents make such a claim, show them this entire answer, and keep working hard, you have nothing to worry about. 

As a seasoned runner I've ran in different countries and did different kind of races (track, trail, road,...). Most races are run on a closed circuit (e.g. no regular traffic on the road). Hence there is no real threat for the runner. The roads itself are wide enough for other runners to pass you. So therefor there is no risk for you (as runner) to wear headphones and to be absent about whats happening behind/around you. Trail-runs however are something entirely different. Some are indeed closed circuit or have volunteers keeping the road open for you to cross it. However there are as many trails where the roads are not closed for the regular traffic. Or where the tracks are very narrow and slower runners might hold up the faster runners. Therefor the organisations often demand the runners to avoid using headphones for their safety and the enjoyment for all runners.In those cases you have to be aware of your surroundings! Because nobody likes to get run over, attacked by a wild animal or get hold up behind an other runner. 

You are correct in thinking that a caloric deficit over a period of time will result in weight loss. Don't listen to anyone else when they say it's more complicated than this because it's not. The only thing more complicated is how you manipulate your macros to reach a certain body composition. For example, if you don't eat protein, you will lose more weight via muscle loss, or if you don't eat carbs, you will lose relatively more fat via ketosis but the end result is the same...weight loss. I see what you're describing all the time...whether it is someone skinny person saying "I eat a lot but can't gain weight", or someone little overweight "I eat less now why am I not skinny yet". Usually, the most common mistake is, you don't ACTUALLY know how much you're eating. You also need to play around with your diet, everyone is a little different. Your ability to lose weight is technically determined by calories in vs calories out but how are you so sure that you're actually in a deficit without counting ? I made this mistake for a solid 3 years, trust me, it makes a huge difference. You're 200 lbs, so this mean your resting metabolic rate is somewhere around 2800-3000 calories (this number could be much lower if you don't have adequate muscle, so start lifting more often and dont lift "light"). Now, knowing this rate, in order to lose about half a lbs a week, you need to consume 2800-3000 minus 500-600 calories on a daily basis, so anywhere from 2000 to 2500 calories to be safe. Use myfitnesspal or a daily log and actually record the calories on everything you eat, are you ACTUALLY consistently eating around this many calories? And please don't fall into the trap of thinking you burn 400-500 calories from these cardio machines, its been proven time and time again that the numbers you observe from these machines are so far from the truth it's not even funny...should be illegalized. Another big mistake that I see here is the excessive cardio that you do. You need to remember that more muscle equates to more calories burned and hence a higher metabolism. Combined with "light" weights, this is a recipe to lose muscle mass. If you lose muscle mass, your metabolism will slow down accordingly, and hence the amount of food you used to consume before hand, may now be too much in order to reach a deficit. Fix: start lifting weights consistently (not light but not too heavy just yet), stop doing cardio so much and if you are going to not stop doing this cardio, consume most of your calories around it. So to sum up: 

After several half marathons and trailruns of around the 25km, I started training for my first marathon on the 15th of Octobre this year. Currently I'm running about 4 times a week with the longest run about 24km (15 miles) without getting into trouble. Running a total of 55km (34 miles) a week. Steadily (without exaggerating) i'm building up my training volume. A friend of mine (who already ran several marathons so far) advised me to incoperate some speedwork into my training. However i don't want to race within a specific time, I just want to finish without suffering too much. So my question is, what are the benefits of speedwork during marathon-training? Keeping in my mind that I won't race to arrive within a specific time. Wouldn't it be better just to keep increasing my milage at a steady pace? Note: I did ready up on some internet-pages. But they all seem to refer to a better finishing time.
