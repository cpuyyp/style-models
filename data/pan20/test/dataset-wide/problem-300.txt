The most probable set of circumstances where this could be the situation is where the arid lands can only support a small, resource impoverished population. While the fertile lands support a well-equipped, well-resourced, well-organized military society. Let's call the rich military land A and its poor arid neighbour B. Simply so we can identify them. Instead of a China with its abundant resources and few military competitors, let's model its society on a highly organized, highly militarized culture like that of the Zulus. This will ensure instead the arid dwellers in B become raiders and plunderers like the Huns and Mongols on a big rich sitting target that was China. Now the raiders will come from A to raid and plunder whatever little in goods, chattels, and resources that were held by the folk in B. To survive A will need to have strong, well-resource neighbours who in tern live on fertile territory. The attacks and raids on B will only occur when there are resources the empire of A needs. Conscript soldiers to fight in their wars or resources like horses (the Mongols had magnificent horses to their advantage). Essentially an aggressive rich military nation can force compliance and a peaceful way of life on their poor, resource-impoverished neighbours who are then have no alternative but to submit. Especially if the poor neighbours B do not have the capacity to mount and maintain a sufficiently strong army to defend themselves against the depredations of their powerful neighbours A. 

No. All three ways are implausible, improbable and, quite likely unscientific. Downloading or uploading minds, consciousness or neurological whatever are based on the fallacy that brains are effectively computers. They aren't, so end of story. Except. A few additional details. Brains don't have compatible interfaces with USB sticks to permit a transfer of anything. Computers are electronic systems and devices. Brains are squidgy of gelatinous lumps of living stuff with its physiology, biochemistry and electrophysiological signalling. The brain isn't a piece of electronic machinery. Consciousness isn't software. [Aside: even if it was, you bet it wouldn't be PC or Mac compatible. Sorry, just joking. :)] To transfer someone's consciousness into a computer you would need to build an electronic analogue of that person's brain. It would have to be capable of simulating all the neurological processes (biochemistry, physiology, neural structures, etc etc.) Copying memories into this brain-analogue would be a non-trivial exercise. This apart from all the other non-trivial exercises involved in building a brain-analogue. Sorry, no, so it's back to the drawing board to devise a better way of uploading minds into machines. Taking into account, this may not be remotely possible. 

There are two possible strategies. One, lie low and hope they both eventually go away. Since both warring alien species have high dark matter content in their bodies, they will, presumably, need to replenish it. Say, like feeding on dark matter food. Two, this is a bit trickier. Neither side has much to offer humanity. So find a way of playing them off against each other. For example, developing detection technology to keep track of where the Yithians and Demons, then passing this information on to their opposition. Basically encourage each other to fight each other to a standstill. Steal weapons and other technology from the aliens and use it to ambush the aliens in hope they will believe it is adversaries who bushwacked them. All the while, keep pretending humans are harmless and stupid. This may be a wild long shot. Find the record of the lost predecessor technology, build the thing and use it to wipe out both warring groups. However, this is probably in the category of palaeolithic cave men trying to find the plans of a thermonuclear weapon, then building it and using it against the combined military forces of NATO. So it probably won't work, except as wishful thinking. As things stand, at the moment with your story neither group of aliens needs to have anything to do with the humans on our planet. It is possible you have overdeveloped your two warring groups of aliens as more or less mindlessly aggressive and well nigh invulnerable adversaries. This some rethinking about the nature of your aliens and their conflict might enable you to come up with a scenario in which play a more decisive role. The story will benefit from this too. 

If the superhuman has any literary talent, they could write novels and short stories at super-speed. They would need to use several hundred pseudonyms to disguise the fact this was only one author producing this enormous body of work. Their chosen field of writing doesn't need to be restricted fiction as non-fiction can be lucrative too. Writing for a living is safe, it is not illegal, and it won't, if done right, expose their super-powers. Of course, if the superhuman also had mind reading super-strength and invulnerability among their super-powers they could become a major investigative journalist. Crime and corruption would be easily exposed. People might become suspicious when this journalist has a remarkable tendency to survive the numerous murder attempts to silence them, and even at point blank range. 

The space station needs multiply redundant systems for all its systems. Fortunately, it is in space where the deterioration of machinery is minimized. Space probes and satellites routinely exceed their estimated working lives (except those that malfunctioned early in their careers). Space station personnel will receive expert training in space station from birth especially if this is their heritage. Folks who are born and die on space stations need to be extra well versed and educated in all aspects of space station maintenance. Your space station should be equipped with an army of repair and maintenance robots. There should be diagnostic sensors in every suitable location to detect the slightest system or structural failure. Every system and component needs to checked and rechecked for good running. This will be part of your space station's design. Easy access to all systems for checking, inspecting and, when needed, repairing. Space station longevity begins with good systems and structural design. Make sure yours is designed for millennia. Do not you cut too many cost corners. The life of your space station and the lives of those living on it don't come cheap. You don't want them going cheaply either. Make sure reliable supply routes are handy. For those occasions, when all your normal systems and procedures for maintaining, repairing and sustaining your space station fail. This could be the usual space piracy, interstellar wars, space whale rustlers or a rogue black hole. Keep handy a goody supply of raw materials that can be converted into manufactured components. Have access to an external energy source by using large solar power collectors or nuclear based power generators (this can be fusion all the way up to antimatter). The power is needed to make and process components. Recycle, recycle, and, don't forget, to recycle. To ensure long term survival, the golden rule is waste not. Defunct components are raw material. Use them again and again. Even if this means reducing to their constituent elements. Remember that's why your power generators are there. Maintain friendly relationships with your neighbours. They are an excellent source for replacement parts and raw materials. Considering most of your raw materials will be extracted from asteroids, moons, and, sometimes, even planets. Territorial claims over who can access and use the material in those astronomical bodies may be in place. If you trespass on their asteroids and remove matter without permission you get a missile up your probic vent. Be nice and respectful. It's a good idea to look after the neighbourhood. Even if they own the local system's asteroids, they might be grateful and let you extract minerals for shipping to their habitats, so in return you could be allowed to take some for yourself. Good design, good work, well trained space station personnel and robots, good relationships with neighbours and suppliers, and leave nothing to chance. Take care for it, and it will take care for you. Five millennia, hah! This baby's good for at least fifteen.
