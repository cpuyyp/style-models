But you can prove to your opponent using logic that his argument is false. What you can't do is to infer from their bad logic, that the thing they were arguing for is actually wrong. By taking away the argument from your opponent, you are taking away reasons to believe in their claim but you are not actually disproving their claim in any way. To do that, you'd need to make non-fallacious arguments on your own. 

You are drilling yourself into a hole without any basis to get back out of it - look at the things you are asking yourself step by step. First of all, to the extent that what we mean by death is the complete and irreversible cessation of all cognitive functions (perhaps an unnecessarily strong definition but suitable for these purposes), there simply is no perspective of the dead person. Since all cognitive functions have per our definition ended, you cannot speak about the subjective experience of the dead person, only of the subjective perspective of the dying person. Can it seem like the universe is ending to the dying person? Sure but that isn't relevant to anything meaningful. One can, after all, hallucinate that the universe is coming to an end under the influence of drugs or dreams but one wouldn't consider this experience epistemologically meaningful. In other words, the answer is simply that the perspective of the dying person is individually determined by the person and the circumstances of their death and it's not clear why any rationally thinking person would put much stock in this experience. A dead person is just as much a person as a table or a rock is and as such experiences nothing. "Nothing" here doesn't merely mean they are sitting in a dark room, it means they don't experience space, the passage of time, the existence of themselves and others and definitely not the end or the existence of the universe. 

I think you may have misunderstood the nature of the Fallacy fallacy. I hope I can help a bit with that. You are of course allowed to point out a fallacy in your opponent's reasoning. That alone does in no way correspond to a Fallacy fallacy. By doing so, you are criticizing their argument and not the claim they made. For example, I can argue that the sun is big because most people believe it is big. You can correctly point out that this is fallacious without commiting a fallacy fallacy. The moment you commit the fallacy fallacy is when you tell people that the sun is clearly not big, because I used a fallacy to argue for it. You say: 

I don't know why you would think that when it's evidently false. You understand how many people die every day? Even as you read this answer here? Not once has an infinite amount of time passed because of that. Maybe what you mean is that when you're dead, you have no experience of the passage of time anymore? Sure, that's true, but lacking an experience of the passage of time in no way means time stopped. Time also doesn't stop when you're unconscious, under anesthesia or when you're functionally dead (though reversibly unlike the above definition) but then brought back by doctors. You experience no time in all those situations and even sometimes when you sleep but that in no way means that no time is passing. This means, though, that "to the ex-dead person", if you bring them back from death somehow, they will feel as though the time interval between their death and their resurrection was 0, i.e. time passed infinitely from "their perspective". But this is an illusion because like I said they don't have a perspective. The human brain would simply interpret this absence of memories of the passage of time as an instantaneous jump in time. TL;DR: There is no instant passage of time happening when people die, not even from their own perspective since they have no perspective. If you somehow brought somebody back long after their death, they would feel as though no time had passed between their death and now but this isn't epistemologically meaningful and it's easy to understand why the brain would make this mistake. 

I'm in the process of treating an elderly diabetic dog(diabetes in dogs is manifested very closely to the one in humans) and constantly hitting the wall of ethics(in my view) regarding human-dog relations with the veterinarians. To detail, around 4-5 vets that I have seen in the past months suggest a certain treatment. That consisting of using a certain drug named caninsulin, which fails heavily(in my view) to keep the blood glucose level between 5-10 mmol/L(as humans aim, when they have diabetes). In the human treatment of diabetes, the doctors change the insulin until their patients can keep their blood glucose level between 5 and 10 mmol/L. Poor glycemic control in people has proven to create physical pain(as headaches, thirst, increased hunger) and fatal injury to other organs(his kidneys did not look good on ultrasound). They would not want to change to another insulin, that I suggest, due to the fact, that they strongly believe that that would ruin my dog's quality of life(we would have to give him 3-4 subcutaneous injections, instead of 2, but that's it). Also, they strongly believe that if I check his blood glucose levels with a glucometer, I'm again ruining heavily his quality of life. I can swear and show to anyone that he is not bothered at all by the glucose tests or insulin injections and rather, I see him very restless when he is hypoglicemic due to the poor glucose control(He is barking his guts of for food, common symptom of hypoglicemia). They are also saying that I'm doing far too much for him, suggesting that I have some kind of mental ilness, and my thoughts on that are that, again, are, that it's a subjective matter, which they are unable to judge due to the lack of information on my interactions with the dog(e.g. memories as a child playing with him). Today, I've made the statement to one of these vets that their suggestion is heavily subjective(keeping in mind their assesment of the dog's quality of life). The vet immediately replied that it is not a mather of ethics(I suppose that would make his statements true and a good examples of facts of our real world). Is the suggested treatment a matter of ethics or not?(What is your opinion?) Are the vets implying that I should see him as subhuman and treat him subhumanely? Note that my questions points mostly to ethics. 

I think there is a bit more than there should be, by my taste, in the others answers. It is a straightforward answer for a person with a bit of mathematical work. The fifth postulate does not stand in 3D curved space, as our world is(see the angles on the spheres for example). Carl Friedrich Gauss once stated in a letter that he doubts the fifth postulate and not the other 4 axioms. Afterwards, JÃ¡nos Bolyai, created a new geometry, where the fifth postulate did not hold (called the hyperbolic geometry). As a conclusive answer, if I understood the question correctly, the axioms are not contingent truths, since another geometry could have been created based on the euclidean geometry. 

I guess this fits under "Moving the goalpost" in some sense, even though the conversation topic was not changed, the proponent of that argument has moved the goalpost from countering that argument to countering another one without admitting that the previous goal has been achieved and was relevant. Of course, a person may legitimately say "Yes, you're right that argument does not work but I think there is another one for my position: [...]." However, shadily acting like nothing was refuted when in fact you showed an argument to be invalid is definitely intellectually dishonest. More generally, the fallacy of moving the goalpost is a special case of the informal fallacy referred to as "Special Pleading". Relevant short wiki entry: $URL$ Also potentially relevant: $URL$ 

Whether or not there is such a thing as a "Philosophical Method" is in itself highly dependent on what definition of "philosophy" one espouses and different people have held widely different definitions throughout history. For an overview of this, the Wikipedia article is actually decent enough: $URL$ I want to hasten to add that while a lot of commenters are speaking out against there being a scientific method, scientists do generally agree more on what science is and is supposed to do than philosophers do on philosophy. So as dynamic and alive science as an endeavor may be, the notion that science does not generally share at least a few common features is just as much a fiction as the idea that every scientific discovery is based on a specific method. Philosophy on the other hand can genuinely be considered inhomogeneous in goal, methods, topics and everything else, really. So to sum up, no there is no accepted Philosophical Method but there are accepted Philosophical methods within certain sub-fields or schools of philosophy. 

I would like to add to the other answers that conventionally the response to this problem is pragmatism. In the context of a philosophical debate, the degree of pragmatism is usually significantly lower than in everyday conversations, which is why skeptical hypotheses are entertained for longer. In everyday conversations, you accept an answer based on your personal standard for evidence and arguments. Of course, I would argue that the way to get over this problem is, again, to pragmatically look for common ground with your partner in conversation and start with arguments and evidence from there. If I'm asked how I know that 1+1=2, I will ask the person if they are familiar with a given set of mathematical axioms. If they say no, I explain them to them and say 1+1=2 follows directly from these axioms and the definition of addition. If they ask "How do you know?" again, I say I use deductive reasoning and show my reasoning to them. I could still have made mistakes in my deductive reasoning, of course, but again pragmatism with regards to topics like these is eventually unavoidable. 

The nature is very wasteful, however the solutions that are too wasteful have little chances to survice. In my opinion it is very inprobable that the creatures that can't make use of consciousness will have it. 

How can you prove that your neighbour have consciousness? How can you prove me that you are conscious? How can you prove if Turing machine is conscious or not? 

Where the psychological tricks of religious fanatics are the dark side of psychology, the religious fanatism itself is the example of the dark side of philosophy. Note the leftist fanatism of Pol Pot, which was based on the base of his philosophy knowledge he gained on Sorbone, the vision of totalitarian regime from Platon's The state. The nazist ideology with their mystic explanation of civilization counting back to Atlantide is one of the darkest pages. In my opinion, the Dark Side of the Philosophy is the darkest one. 

Your statement can be inverted: One of the things that seems the most bizarre about economy based on income as is its horrible record at producing the philosophical ideas. In my opinion, economy based on income is something temporary, that will eventually perish, and the philosophy will stay, because it asks the most important questions about who we are and where we are going. This questions will always stay on topic. The philosophy need not to produce income. The greatest philosophers haven't written their prominent works for profit, they asked the big questions because of this questions itself. If someone just wants money, he/she won't be the great philosopher, because great philosopher is someone who loves wisdom, so he/she dont' need the financial encouragement to be philosopher. 

You're asking about absolute tolerance, which is indeed possible, but only, if you're observer. You can find absolute tolerance in wildlife films. The narrator doesn't form any ethical statements for the behaviour of the animals, because he/she is external to the events presented there. In political sphere you're not an observer by definition. You're involved in the process, being observer would require from you to be fully indifferent to your own life, which is practically impossible (every living being has the mechanism of self-preservation. So, wherever the tolerance is mentioned in the political sphere, is is, with exception of purely theoretic speculations, the limited tolerance, the tolerance towards. From practical point of view, you can't be tolerant towards someone who attempts to kill you and have the possibility to achieve this. Either you'll be forced to prevent this actions, changing your tolerance policy, or don't prevent this, and your tolerance will stop existing with you. 

We can hardly understand the way the other people communicate with themselves. The philosophical question about how to communicate with beings, who are not like us, whose communication is not like anything we know is stated in many books, see the St. Lem's Solaris - a vision of extraterral being who is trying to communicate with us, but every effort to understand this communication fails.
