Do we know whether whole blade was stuck in the stone or just a part of it? Suppose whole blade is emerged in the fake-solid stone. There is a hollow full of synthetic oil to suppress any degradation of the blade. There is a bayonet mount disguised decorative-magic engraved symbols and it contains pure gold ring which serves as metal sealing. The bayonet is connected to the DNA detector and releases the sword at appropriate time. There are also rubber, viton or silicone blades just to remove the oil when the Chosen One (TM) pulls the sword out. Therefore the only part of the sword to face the ages is the handle. Luckily for Merlin there is a plenty of commercially available surface treatments to enhance the oxidation resistance and appeareance. There is hot bluing and black oxidizing finish which gives the oxidation resistance (oxides usually do not oxidize) and dark blue-black matte finish. Thin film of TiN will give the oxidation resistance and gold finish, TiAlN will give purple finish. He can also look for TiO2 film which can be superhyrophilic and when illuminated by UV light it can clean itself from bacteria and algae. Merlin can also look for rare-earth metal oxide coatings which can provide hard and superhydophobic surfaces. 

All the reasons above have slight positive feedback and al the people pay taxes. The cities have usually better prices than their "customers" so that they can develop a force (army) to protect their interests. 

Maybe. Progress would be exceedingly slow, but your people can somehow remember skills like reading and writing, which can serve as a sort of substitute memory once they develop it. They would probably have to be obsessive at noting things down, or else spend a lot of time - a lot more extra time going over the same ground day after day because they forgot they had already done it. And they would lose the thinking time - noting down ideas will help, but following a train of thought would be difficult over time with only written records, and not time to let ideas "stew" inside the mind to synthesize. On the other hand, learning actual skills is the only way for this people to advance themselves, they can't lean on rote memorization (as our education systems sometimes do) - so perhaps they will get the most out of their education, when they can get it, instead of memorize-and-forgetting it. they would have to learn mathematical formulas, instead of memorizing constants, and learn critical thinking and analysis, instead of memorizing facts and 'standard' interpretations. The line between "learnable skill" and "personal memory" is going to be really, really important to what they can learn, and what they forget. But, given that they might end up being obsessive over memory, possibly their technology would revolve around overcoming this handicap - which could let them reach an advanced civilization anyway. (similarly, perhaps, to the way so much of our technology revolves around our lack of physical weaponry, so we're always searching for ways to be more and more lethal). This civilization would evolve writing, drawing, and storing records to the most efficient levels. The development of photographs and video would also be prized, and encouraged to develop early and deeply to serve as a prosthetic memory. Their cave drawings, rather than being symbolic or religious (or historical) would have crude maps to the best places, and a cruder tallying of how often they go to any place, so they know what's picked over, and what's still likely to have food. They would use tokens, maybe, to show what had been done or said or decided on any day, that needed to be acted on the next (like who did which chore, who slacked off, who needed punished). They would develop writing, and ways of preserving their records, as elaborately as they could - because it is instant value, and the more information they can pack in there the better. It's still a pretty big handicap to overcome, though. 

The comments seem fixated on the interpretation that you are asking about computer viruses in general. However, I'm assuming you're asking about how to construct a plausible virus that is spread by physical proximity, in contrast to most modern computer viruses, which spread through network proximity, the nodes of which can be physically very distant. Computer malware is built to exploit what is available, rather than what is preferable. If your synthetic citizens make use of something like modern Near Field Communication, perhaps there's some vulnerability in the standardized software protocols or common hardware used to enable that technology. For instance, maybe your synthetic actors use NFC as a form of proof of identity, like a literal manifestation of modern cryptographic handshakes that allow two parties to trust each other. This might be done over NFC for added security or perhaps for some kind of cultural reason. But, if that tech is compromised by a worm that lies in wait until the infected person "handshakes" with someone else, it could spread like biological diseases. NFC uses radio waves but you could adapt this idea for faster/denser forms of communication, as well. For instance, a visible light or IR-based communication method would require that the transmitter and receiver have line-of-sight to each other, which could be spun to generally require physical proximity for some kind of convenience. Alternatively, you could use something like a QR code. Maybe your synthetic citizens all have high-speed, "subconscious" barcode readers built into their visual sensors that allow them to rapidly decode barcode-encoded data as they walk past it. For instance, if your society grew to use them pervasively for things like advertising or street signs. But there could be a vulnerability in the decoding software that allows arbitrary code to be run or a more convoluted attack that exploits the auto-execution functions of these high-speed readers to direct the victim's networking software to download a malicious file without permission. It could also spread like a worm, instructing the victim to brand themselves with the malicious QR code or paste it onto physical objects. I think both approaches are rich in narrative possibilities. The former example has obvious parallels to human handshakes and physical interactions that could be an interesting exploration in a society filled with synthetic intelligences. The latter is evocative of sci-fi horror "viruses" like Dead Space's Markers, which self-propagate to terrifying effect. 

If you're talking about split-second communication, like shouting, I think touch is your best bet - it is immediate, while something like writing or visual signs or gestures require the other person to be looking in the right direction, at the right time. Tapping at or thumping someone will get their attention immediately - the direct equivalent of shouting, since it actively draws the attention, not waits to be noticed. if someone needs to pay attention, being twapped will draw attention from the most distracted, if they need to move, being dragged out of the way is better than being run over. Most basic, urgent communication will have a touch translation anyway, since basic, urgent communication is very likely to have equivalents in every method of communication we can find, create, or imagine - the better to survive in any situation where they might be needed. If someone's outside of physical range, slapping at something else, like a wall, or water surface, or instrument, will create sound to alert your humans, and create waves/motion/disturbance in the water or whatever the equivalent sense is that your other people use to alert themselves to non-obvious motion. Or use a flashlight or something, for communicating pay attention across the distance... it will be needed to grab attention in case someone is looking the other way when they really need to be listening. For less urgent communication, some combination of sign language or gestures would probably be more versatile (and again, touch bridges that gap between what a person is looking at and what they need to "hear" right away). You can also involve writing or better yet, drawing for precise details once there's time for explaining. translation passbooks, machines, pidgin, or anything else can be developed or used at their leisure. 

One of the problems with talking about a general AI (that is, one that can incorporate new knowledge in a generalized fashion, like humans can) is that we don't really know how it would think. People tend to either anthropomorphize the AI, assuming that it will have human-like motivations and goals, or completely dehumanize it, assuming that it will be an expensive calculator with no subjective experience or personal motivations. They also often assume that an AI made to be more intelligent than humans would be controllable by humans. Ray Kurzweil has written about this topic a fair bit and even goes into a plausible fictional scenario involving the creation of a super-intelligent general AI in How to Create a Mind. In that scenario, the AI exploited the systems of humans (governments, media, economy) to secretly attain ever more control, eventually leading to a benevolent dictatorship where the AI controlled every facet of life on the planet but did so in a way that increased the quality of life for most people and managed it all without a single gunshot. I believe Max Tegmark also explored several possible outcomes of the creation of super intelligence in Life 3.0, to a fair degree of detail. What both authors suggest is that the AI is giving humanity something back for gaining greater control. Since the AI itself may not be motivated by things like ego or jealousy, its desire for control could very genuinely be in order to improve living conditions. Kurzweil's scenario has the AI replacing corrupt governments with one extremely efficient dictatorship and replacing capitalist or communist systems with a post-scarcity system based on personal fulfillment. One of Tegmark's scenarios describes the AI creating an almost perfect libertarian world where people can choose to live in the post-scarcity society ruled by the AI or can choose to live by their own means outside of the AI cities; though the AI itself was somewhat apathetic towards humans, preferring to keep out of sight so it could work on its own goals. In the former case, the AI maintained control through secrecy and then by winning the hearts of humanity. People wanted the benefits that came with being controlled by the AI, even if they didn't know an AI was pulling the strings. In the latter, the AI was so much more intelligence and capable than humans that it could simply monitor all behaviors and put down any aggressive movements before they became a threat. It was merely the moral biases implanted by its creators that stopped it from simply collecting the matter of all humans so it could make more computer parts to expand itself with. But, humans are probably always going to behave irrationally, at times. No matter how much better off everyone is under an AI-controlled system, there's always going to be that one guy trying to incite insurrection. Police forces (or robot armies or kill switches implanted in everyone's skull) are always a means for the party in control to maintain control. So even a utopian society with no political disagreements would need some means of physical compulsion to prevent irrational behavior from threatening the system. I mean, how would a utopian AI manage someone with violent paranoia? Kill them, treat them, isolate them; all solutions require a means of physical compulsion, even if that means is another human following orders (or subconscious suggestions). Back to my thesis, we have no way of knowing how an AI could go about gaining and maintaining control over things. It's a system that, by definition, thinks better and, perhaps, differently than we do. The AI could appear barely more competent than humans, letting human politicians and administrators do all the talking, while secretly having absolute control over everything. Maybe it could control people's decision making through targeting each individual's media or could affect each individual's body chemistry in a predictable fashion. Or it could secretly replace all the human politicians with perfect, synthetic copies under the AI's control. Maybe it develops a swarm of nanoscopic killbots that can put down any dissidents in a way that is indistinguishable from a natural death or suicide or accident. Maybe it's smart/capable enough to literally erase a person from existence, leaving no physical trace or memory or possibility for logical deduction of their existence. If you let the AI get smart enough, it could very well be indistinguishable from God.
