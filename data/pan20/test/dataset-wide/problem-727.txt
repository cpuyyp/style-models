As a bottom line, it was fundamental to have the points of view of everyone who answered or commented. I suspected that here in StackExchange people would be more traditional and classically oriented, and the vast majority supported the idea that big is not a problem if you don't make it into a problem. That also, reinforced a perception I have, that all this hype about smaller-frame-size-possible due to weight or responsiveness or center of gravity or whatever is way too much exagerated. Thanks for the help, and if I have some useful additional feedback I'll post it. 

Just to build upon the points of view already presented, I think that shifting at the same time would not be a big problem provided that: 

That's right, there is even a category in Down Hill races called "hard tail", for people with, well, hard-tail bikes. And they kick some serious arses with those bikes. 

The situation you describe is critical, but when conditions allow, I would suggest you a technique I developed exactely for that. The secret is to "ride the wall" as you were in the tilted section of a velodrome, that is, making a curve with your bike. Most falls I have seen or heard, or even almost had myself, are caused by making a curve to the left while trying to climb the ramp sloped towards the other side. That makes the front tire skid if the step is steep, or if the surface is somewhat slippery. Then, the trick is: 

These are structural parts that are vital for safety and/or are likely to be damaged in an impact like yours (looks like frontal impact?) Hope this helps 

EDIT: take away the handlebar and perhaps the front brake, and perform some barspins, to reorient the spheres. This could be the "Step 1.5" Hope it helps 

Like you said, they are cottered, what makes them aligned is that pin through a hole, which at the same time tightens the crank arm around the axle. If you google "cottered crank", you can see the spindle, which has a slot in each side. My hypothesis would be: or the cottering bold got deformed, or the spindle slot itself got deformed, or both. A bolder hypothesis would be twisting of the spindle due to deformation or cracking, but most probably the bearings would not spin freely (how are the cranks spinning, by the way?) The side which appears on your photo looks OK from outside, the other side we cannot tell. But for sure this is a VERY irregular situation, which demand a full disassembly of the system, and absolutely no use before that. 

EDIT: The answer posted by Daniel Hicks and the comment by user973810 are better. Just in case, the following method works. (Unfortunately, this is normal.) When the link is closed back, the opposing compression caused by the chain tool and the incoming pin makes the outer plates become hardly pressed against each other, which means they press all other layers (inner plates and roller) too. Fortunately it is very easy to "fix" it: just grab firmly with your hands, one around each side of the hard link, and bend it SIDEWAYS, with some serious force (but not raw violence), as if you wanted to bend the chain. Do it for both sides ("left" and "right" of the chain). You'll notice the link is now free. If it is just less stiff, do it again. Don't be afraid, it won't damage the chain, only your wrists if you don't grab firmly (because the chain might suddenly flex along it's normal flexing direction, twisting your hands). Unfortunatly, most times this procedure leaves your hands stained/dirty. You can use gloves or some pieces of old newspaper to avoid it. Hope it helps. 

By heavy I suppose you mean heavier than you'd like it to be, or heavier than you can live with comfortably. It's probably possible, sometimes, to change lanes beforehand, going to the left one to do the left turn, if the traffic is not so heavy, but that would, I think, violate your pre-condition that the traffic IS heavy. Then, the canonical way to do it would be getting to the margin of the flow (in this case, the sidewalk), and waiting for a comfortable opportunity (in this case, the pedestrian light). Turn left directly is a very bad behaviour, as it adds a lot of unpredictability and leaves a small time window and a small margin of safety for you and for any other user of the public way. Besides, as it seems, it is illegal. Hope this helps 

Make spoke tension be equal on every spoke; With an inflated tire, hit the out-of center parts or the TIRE against, say, a tree, while grabbing THE TIRE with your hands. 

My two cents: If you align the gap in the tube with the gap in the clamp, the grip will be much stronger. You'll need less force in the lever to hold the seatpost in place. If you keep them counter-aligned, you'll exert considerably less pressure, and there is a chance that the pressure will be "more evenly" distributed, although I don't "feel" it to be necessarily like this, since it is only the frame itself that actually deforms to grip the seatpost, and I think it tends do deform the same way on both cases (a lot of common-sense here, that would need experimental data to be totally sure). My advice would be: use first option UNLESS you have reasons not to do so. Such reasons could be: sensitive seatpost (carbon fiber, delicate metals), or a tendency from the clamp to leave marks/grooves in the seatpost. 

One of the most important things when you put a fork on a bike is how it "fits" the bike's frame geometry. Ideally fork and frame are designed together in what is called a "frameset". The geometry, which difectly determines fit and handling, is only complete when you consider a frameset, not a frame alone, neither a fork alone. Nowadays, many mountainbikes are designed to be used with a suspension fork with relative large travels, for example 100mm. Then, if you take a rigid bike and put a suspension, you'll lift the bottom bracket, decrease the seat tube angle and decrease the head tube angle, unavoidably altering fit and handling. Also, if you take a frame that's supposed to run a suspension and install a (shorter) fork, or even a shorter suspension, the same effects happen in the same way. That's why Surly (a manufacturer) produces "100mm corrected" framesets, which consist of a frame ready to receive a suspension fork, and a fork substantially longer than needed (about the same size of a 100mm suspension fork. I have already made both changes (lifting and lowering the front-end of a bicycle via exchanging suspension or fork). The result in terms of rideability, when the bike is not "ready", is always a bit awkward. Talking about fork materials and rigidity, from my experience rigid forks from any material are pretty rigid, to the point you cannot actually note any difference. Some steel forks have wide curves close to the dropouts, in order to absorb some shock, but that's a very old-fashioned design, and would look definitely "wrong" on a mountain bike. Mountain bikes should absorb shock via a suspension-fork, or wide tires, or both. A side effect of some suspension forks is that handling becomes a bit wobbly either because of torsion/deformation of the fork itself while steering/cornering, either because of altered handling geometry (raising the front increases caster, making the bike potentially "slow" to steer). I have seen broken forks, and have broken/bent some cheap ones myself in the past, but I think any decent one (in your price range) would be fine. Aluminum ones are probably lighter and very well suited to your intended use. You just should choose one that has at least a similar geometry to your current one, specially if you like the way your bike handles and don't want to spoil that. Hope it helps. 

Besides that, I think there is a compulsory speed limit depending on age. For example, for under one year old, I think 10mph is the absolute maximum acceptable speed under ideal conditions. For toddlers and very young babies, I think the main concern is protection from mechanical shock, and ability to keep it under your eyes, preferrably with eye contact. In the event of braking, the seat must provide support. In that sense, the following "concepts" seems UTTERLY INAPPROPRIATE: 

The material itself is not so important, I think, but for sure the alloy jockeys last longer than plastic ones. Besides that, the main adventage comes with the (often coming together with alloy pulleys) BEARING you already mentioned. Besides eliminating lateral play and so improving shifting precision (in my perception), they also decrease rolling resistance and improve drivetrain efficiency. Finally, these bearings work better suffer less without lube (don't wear out inside like plastic pulleys), and require much less lubing in the first place. Well, these are my insights. Hope it helps. 

The desired conversion is possible, but maybe Trek won't do it as a "default" service. You could consider going to the local bike shop and trade some of the bike parts (specially the gearing system) for a coaster brake wheel. If your bike is like the one in the photo, you need to replace the rear hub, and get rid of the cogset, the derailer and the twist-shifter. You can do this at home if you have some mechanical skils, but replacing the hub and relacing the spokes is not very simple. And if you're so chatty with the lovely ladies as you are when asking questions on the internet, they sure get a lot of talk! ;o) EDIT: As Freiheit has correctly pointed, when you put a single cog and get rid of the derailer, something must be added to compensate for the almost inevitable chain slack. I suggest a tensioner like this, of DMR brand (with a bolt, to be placed in a fixed position, not a spring): 

I'll try to help, but I'm not sure about EVERY details of your fork, so let's see: RLC means (adjustable) Rebound, Compression and Lockout. If it rebounds, there is still some preload on your fork, but if your weight is enough to make it go down, perhaps the preload is not enough. Since your fork is air-sprung, it would make me think of very low pressure on the air-spring compartment. Lockout works, so there is oil inside, which is the mechanism used by most lockout systems: entirely closing the compression oil valve. You said PSI is at 90-100, which in some models is too little pressure. I have an RST model which demands me to put 170 psi. In the other hand I had another (larger bore) suspension which was fine with 40 psi. I don't know if this pressure is enough. Even so, perhaps your model has MORE THAN ONE schraeder valve, so one would be "positive" pressure, the other would be "negative pressure" (or "low speed compression", or any other fancy name the factory creates). The most interesting part is "it seems to SLOWLY sink when I'm on the bike". See questions later. I have this questions, which you could put on comments or re-edit your original question: 

Since it is an halogen light (correct me if I'm wrong), there is a socket inside, with a spring or something, where you "screw" the lamp. Maybe the spring got weak, there is some rust, or some other sort of bad-quality electrical connection. Since the lamps are meant to be replaceable by the user, you could do it yourself perhaps without any tool, or perhaps with a small screwdriver or some sort of tiny plier. If you are in doubt, you could take the light to some friend or shop to take a look inside, for obvious bad-connections caused by rust or misalignments. A simple cleaning would do it, the lamp connections are always quite similar. The forum refers to adjusting the light angle, twisting the whole headlight, while it could be too tightly fixed on the bike. That would mean the headlight outer casing and/or internal structure got a little bent and misaligned. A movement in the oposite direction coud straighten things back to normal, perhaps. Hope it helps. 

Dilation, a drastic one, but TO THE COLD! Since aluminum dilates more than steel, you should FREEZE the seatpost, by pouring some very very cold substance inside. Liquid nitrogen (frostbite danger), dry ice (perhaps not cold enough) and CO2 cartridges (doesn't remain inside for too long) are good candidates. Perhaps if you wrap a towel around the seat tube, pour boiling water on it, then pour the freezing stuff of your preference inside the seat tube, you'll crack the bond indeed, as you planned. Total mechanical disintegration. You'd look for some heavy machining tools (lathes and all) and eat the post from inside. Some damage to the inner surface of the seat tube is very probable. 

Professional psychological (of course, if she agrees...); Riding in non-traffic areas (a sinuous park or countryside would be great). 

Rim tape can actually slip, slowly, due to heat and/or mechanical stresses (rolling of the wheel, twisted tube), but would be my choice, since they're not elastic (accept high pressures well) and can't damage the tubes. Rim strips are very fine, but their edges might become hard with aging, and I have had some flats due to cuts in the innertubes caused by these edges. Have never used plugs (actually didn't know they existed), so cannot tell about them.
