Player Chars in Sim Well, if you insist on having all sorts of monsters and beings and spirits and ghosts, there is an easy way to get it. Make it all be a big, fat sim, with the Avatars mere shells if the player chars are not there to direct them or if the connection is broken somehow. The players don't have to be explicitly human, and need not have explicit memory of the out-of-sim world, (perhaps it is censored during gameplay for added realism). Or maybe it's not a game, but a punishment, or a (loyalty? ability?) test... who knows? 

Mmm, in a 30% oxygen environment, human hair and some fatty human tissues would burn like a paraffin torch at the smallest spark. Not that you would much care at that point. The 20% CO2 (=200,000 ppm) would have you unconscious and dying in minutes. 

Would they make their presence and awareness of the game-situation known, or would they keep their simulated heads down and continue poking undetected, hoping that some automated bug-cleaner doesn't wipe them out? Detailed Context: Appears to be a historical simulation of some sort, centered around 2015-2016 C.E., perhaps better known as the present-day world. The game/simulation seems precise/detailed to the atomic (or perhaps subatomic level), and is an open-world, at least as far as Earth's surface is concerned. The game-aware group appear to be exclusively non-player-characters, or NPCs, (at least none have any memory of having been possessed!). It took some effort to get here, but the group of similarly awaken NPCs are able to identify player-characters (PCs) by sight, as they now (did not have this ability before) can see a red aura or glow around the PCs. The group haven't exactly done a scientific survey, but the PCs seem to comprise about 0.5% of the population, with some presence in all social classes, but with a marked predisposition towards the ultra-rich and famous. It's hard to be exactly sure, but the 'make-PCs glow red' achievement strongly suggests that the group's methods so far gave them access to some run-time debugger or perhaps a limited section of the source code. The PCs seem unaware of the situation. It seems likely that the "source" civilization is probably a descendant of humanity, with generally higher technology levels than the present (just running this Earth sim would tax in-sim technology to the breaking point), and uncertain motives in running this game/simulation, but otherwise the PCs have not yet evidenced strongly superhuman cognitive or physical abilities. Edit: To clarify, the PCs can be assumed to know that the NPCs are self-aware, since that's the point of the simulation. The PCs do not know that the NPCs have identified them as coming from "outside". 

This exists in the real world: Chimeras There actually are creatures (including humans) who have multiple cellular DNA streams flowing through their body. These folks (or beasts, as the case may be) are called Chimeras. Tetragametic chimerism (or monstrous chimerism) is usually congenital and is the result of merging of non-identical twin zygotes. Such chimeras may sometimes have multiple sets of sex organs, for instance, with different genetic makeup. These usually result in a non-standard body plan. Most cases are far more subtle and result in a normal body plan, often going undetected. There have been cases of women giving birth to what are genetically their own sisters or nieces (because genetic material from their own mothers or twins made it into the embryo). The most famous case along these lines is that of Lydia Fairchild, who had birthed children that did not seem to be genetically hers, which landed her in hot water with the courts when she asked for child support. She was later shown to be a chimera. None of these examples are quite as specialized as what you describe, but from reality to your example isn't as great a leap as one might expect 

IF Air pressure is not constant throughout then you have an easy UP-DOWN dimension. Down is the opposite of the direction of Gasping Death. We'll instead assume that the air pressure is constant somehow (transparent handwavium alloys) IF there are outer stars visible, then you can use them to define a simple 3-D coordinate system. Pick a North Star. Pick another bright star at a 90 degree angle to it. Call that your reference direction ♈ as your vernal point that defines your plane of reference. Find the island in the center of your air-ocean, or the empty air-filled void therein. You now have all you need to calculate the longitude of the ascending node (☊), Inclination ($i$), and the Argument of periapsis $\omega$, from an idealized position in the center of the air-filled sphere. 

The Ancient Sons of Merk had used their knowledge of Pshysik and the Dark Arts of peering into the bodies of dead men to extend their lives to unnatural length. While lesser Merkans could live for ten times the span of a normal man and remain unwearied, the higher among them, the sons of Buffet and Walton, could live for untold Aeons without showing outward signs of age. However, the weight of the ages grew on their weary shoulders, some among these princes would build massive complexes and undergo a dreaded ritual called Uthenera where they would lay down to sleep for an age. Others, wrought with wanderlust, took to traveling the untold distances in the skies, seeking the homes of the angels, to places so far away that Earthen-time lost all meaning to them. Thus it was that for them, a thousand years was but the blink of an eye, and husband and wife would plan to meet millenia in the future like us mere mortals would plan meeting for a cup of nesqiq in the long red evenings. Their dwellings were great and lasting, on the earth and their Great Depots in the sky, where the Cargo came from, and many became great temples of worship for us, the sons of Moroni, Amesh and Hassid and for the other men of the world. After age upon age, their weariness grew, and many never awoke from Uthenera or never returned from their wanderings. No more Cargo arrived, and the great Spaceports of old were slowly overrun with weeds and age. It is said that the Buffeti princes waged a great war against the Angels in the sky, and were crushed, and the Angles laid down the Kessler Curse, a sword of flame in the skies to prevent men from ever rising to the heavens and challenging them again. Every now and then, on dark and clear nights you can see the sword slashing across the sky over and over again.
