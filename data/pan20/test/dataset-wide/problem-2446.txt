Since the question is broad my answer is opinionated towards the Theravada tradition. Main aspect of Buddhism is that your practice should cover the 8 fold path (which is part of Bodhipakkhiyādhammā). Out of which a major part is meditation but ethics / morality is important. Your choice of study ideally should cover the Bodhipakkhiyādhammā, Dependent Origination, and 4 Noble Truths. You should pick a set of Suttas covering these areas which suits your temperament. 

Craving arises in conjunction with sensation. To let go of craving you have to be unanimous to what is pleasant and unpleasant sensation. In addition you have to remove ignorance by seeing the impermanence nature of neutral sensations. [Pahana Sutta] I see that you have used "I" couple of times. I conceiving lead to craving. [Tanha Jalini Sutta, Cula Vedalla Sutta] Also thoughts of past and future has "I" and the subject. For this see perception of self arising, the evaluation being favorable (watching a good movie), unfavorable (I do not have this latest movie) and neutral (I do not care about this movie) and how this proliferates to sensations and finally craving. Through Vipassana you should see this sensations arising and passing while being equanimous. This will help you realise there is no controlling, everlasting self. Whatever which is not entirely pleasant cannot be taken as self. When something pleasant changes it is unpleasant, the unpleasant is unpleasant on its own, the conditioned is unpleasant when unknown. [Cula Vedalla Sutta] Understanding sensation lead to understanding the 4 Noble Truths and Dependent Arising and eradicating the unwholesome roots.

I have heard about are couple of places in the Vinaya which discusses situations involving reanimated corpses. I want to find the exact locations and reference. Also are there any other in the Tipitaka and / or Commentaries this appear? In addition, p252, THE IMPERIAL GAZETTEER OF INDIA THE INDIAN EMPIRE VOL II HISTORICAL mentions:

Vaṇijjā sutta discusses Right Livelihood in for levity which include: business in weapons, business in human beings, business in meat, business in intoxicants, and business in poison. If you sell meat or drinks for a living this is not right livelihood. I think is suffices if you are part of the establishment and need not be the proprietor / owner / shareholder. So if you work in a meat shop or bar or liquor store then this is not right livelihood. If you are working is a big supermarket which sells among anything meat and drinks and you work in a generic counter not dedicated for the sale of meats or drinks then this might be OK. I.e., if you are part of a large store out of which a small part of business is meats, drinks and poisons unless you are involved is specifically to procure and sell these items it might be OK. As management or owner or shareholder of such business might be OK if this is a minor line of business and you are not involved in the planning and management of such activities. Kandaraka Sutta, Apannaka Sutta mentions that those who torment themselves, those who torment others, those who torment both, and those who torment neither themselves nor others, out of which the last is the most conducive. Similarly one's job or business should be ideally organised around the same principles. Also Ama,gandha Sutta discusses that it is not meat you should abstain from but from evil action. So in conclusion bartending, being in the wine counter, being part of a butcher or meat shop, or being in the meat counter, is not right livelihood, but eating meat is not an issue.

Perhaps you can try to restrict distraction by non reaction to the sensory input, which is to maintain the domain, and also be non deluded by at least seeing arising and passing nature of the experience. Also if the thought that district you are not related to the path you can abandon them. More on this see Vitakka Saṇṭhāna Sutta. Also be careful there is no lapse of mindfulness which might lead to unwholesome or unsuitable thought to arise. To quiet your active mind perhaps you can try out developing the Jhana factors. Saṅkhitta Dhamma Sutta. If initial and sustained application is developed within the 4 Frames of Reference this also you are keeping to the domain, purpose, doing what is suitable and non deluded, while also getting and handle on the distracting thoughts through concentration. To apply this to daily activities always see it your mind is with the 4 Frames of Reference periodically, with initial and sustained application, contemplating the at least impermanence of the of the three characteristics, as you go through your daily activities. 

Tanhā Jālinī Sutta, (Vicarita) Tanha Sutta shows most speculation about self and other lead to craving. The objective of meditation is to reduce craving, hence lack of craving helps you. Craving is linked to Sensual Pleasures which is also a Hindrance. Reducing hindrances also help calm your mind and meditate. 

Keep doing it until this becomes second nature and effortless. Then you will be in the present moment and many of your worries will go away. Also the concept of impermanence is that the world / universe is in a flux of change. Weather, people, neighborhoods, etc. all keep changing. It is not that the world or universe will come to an abrupt end. Nothing to be too worried over. If you want something that changes not to change then you will be disappointed. 

If you are doing breath meditation this can be an issue as the best place to have your attention is at the base of the nose and upper lip. If you can't breathe through your nose all is not lost as you can put your attention to your stomach or chest in addition to the around the mouth. If you do breath meditation your nose will clear up. I have been having stuffed nose before I started on meditation but it went away later on. So even on a stuffed nose it is best to breathe through your nose.
