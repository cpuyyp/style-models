I have two bikes, a hybrid commuter with skinny tyres, full mud guards & rim brakes, then I have a 29er hardtail MTB with hydraulic disc brakes and off road tyres. Which would be best, for commuting (with a minimum modification cost) in the snow? (this is likeley to be a small-medium amount of snow, perhaps having been compressed by other vehicles/walkers) 

My free hub body has cracked and im looking to replace it. I have discovered it uses a 14mm hex key to remove. I cannot find a freehub body for sale that matches m785. Will a "m760-m765" body fit my "m785" hub? 

I think your indexing might be off. Before trying Argentis answer, try adjusting the derailur's barrel adjuster to get the jockey wheels in line with the cogs. Watch this for reference 

(1) and (3) gear are sort easy to set (tightest -- loosest tension) (2) is the tricky gear to set up. So ride the bike down the street and shift between gears. Keep going for a few pedals revolutions. If the gears are aligned very close, it will take a few revolutions for it to skip. When it does, play around with the gear cable accordingly. Repeat these steps as necessary: 

It could be a number of things. The most likely it sounds as if your cable is sticking/jamming. Try replacing your cable and cable housing. This shouldnt cost much for DIY (read up on how to do it, you dont want to crush the housing when cutting), but would cost more from a mechanic. I would firstly check that your deraileur isnt out of alignment and/or loose or bent first. Another thing you can do is check that you have the right chain for your cassette and that the chain isnt worn (a cheap tool will check this for you). If your mechanic has not solved this, I suggest trying a different one. 

It is almost impossible to rebuild a wheel (i.e., new hub and new spokes) without removing the tire. Leaving the tire on, would mean leaving the spoke nipples in place. (It is a good idea to replace the spoke nipples when rebuilding a wheel. You will also require new spokes). It is a big hassle threading the spoke into nipples that are stuck in one position. Almost all wheel builders will first remove the tire. It should be possible to carefully remove and reuse your tubular tire anyway, so this may be less of an issue than you think. (What adhesive did you use?) 11-speed compatibility options In terms of replacing your hub to get 11 speed compatibility. There are a few different options to consider. Custom wheel builds are not cheap. If your rims are not in pristine condition or insanely expensive it may be more cost effective to sell your wheels (or wheelset) and buy purchase a replacement wheelset that is 11 speed compatible. (Note an 11-speed rear wheel can take 10-speed cassettes with the appropriate spacer). You may also check what rear hub you have, some more recent hubs that started their life as 8/9/10 speed hubs were designed to allow the cassette freehub bodies to be changed in order to enable 11-speed compatibility (although this is not a common feature, it does exist and you may be lucky enough to own one). 

If you want to keep all the bikes on the floor, you can get wooden pallets, cut them in half and attached the one half perpendicular to the other one. Make sure to align the slits so the tires will fit. 

Default gear is HIGH (3). this mean there is no tension in the cable and the spindle is all the way into the hub. And Low gear (1) is when the cable is at the tightest. So you want to set the low gear first 

I could be caused because the chain is not running a straight line from the rear cogs to the front chain rings. If you put the bike on the stand and follow the chain from the top of the cogs to the chainrings. You will see if it follows a straight line. It might be slight off so that it won't jump off when on the stand but it does when there is pressure. Another reason could the rear cogs wable. If it so, you will need to change the cogs. 

I can appreciate that some materials are lighter than others and some have more flex than others, but overall, how do different frame materials affect handling of the bike? Assuming the same geometry and design. What are the main handling characteristics of each of the below common frame materials? 

You will find (usually an allen/hex key) bolt on the brake pad itself. Loosen that, align your brake pads then re-tigthen. You may also need to adjust again on the bars to get it to fit. You will also find it easier when loose and aligning them, to pull the brakes right up to the rim and tighten the bolts. Everything you need to know you will find here: $URL$ 

Once you feel the gears are aligned, bring the lock ring up to lock the gear cable. As the gear cable stretches, the gears will get out of synch. You will notice that because gears will start skipping. Just tighten to gear cable by 1/3 or a turn. It will take time to get it right and it can be frustrated. If no matter what you do, the gears keep skipping, don't ride the bike as you will damage the internal mechs of the hub. I learn that the hard way. Instead, bring it to the bike shop and have then set it. Then asked them to show you what they did. 

You can cut the skewer, but be sure to leave enough thread on there to keep the nut on when the QR is opened enough to take it off your bike (without having to remove the nut). Don't forget to file the sharp cut edge smooth afterwards. 

I would reccomend against this. It only takes 10 seconds to hop on a bike and make off. Although some suggestions come to mind 

One for every removeable or adjustable part on your bike (including tyres). With the exception of those you will be unable to repair/fix on the trail, such has hubs and bottom brackets. They need not all be combined with one tool though (sometimes individual tools can be lighter) 

The pin needs to be pulled out. You can remove it using a wrench inserted in the kickstand for leverage to push the ring and that will loosen up the pin. If you need a visual, see this video. Hope it helps. 

A 70's/80's Roadmaster Pursuit bike makes a clicking noise when turning right. It doesn't make any noise when riding straight or turning left. It doesn't seem to matter how close the turn is. I have checked the headset and all bearings are fine. I checked the axle and that is fine too. I cleaned and greased both and still makes the noise. Any suggestions as to what else could it be causing it? 

Chain suck is the likely culprit. When the chain is dirty, lacks lube, or is otherwise out of spec (i.e., worn) is combined with a small chain ring with an off-angle chain line there can be a slight delay in disengagement of the chain from the small chain ring (the small diameter exacerbates this problem further). This delay when combined with tight tolerances between the frame and the chairring can lead to to the chain getting jammed between the frame and chainring. This would also pull the bottom of the derailleur cage (that holds the jockey wheels) towards the front of the bike. This was typically a problem with bikes that had triple crankset. To move to 2x and 1x has made this largely an issue of the past.
