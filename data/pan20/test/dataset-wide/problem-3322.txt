Here the subscript (i)'s are there to show that our interpretation of the word it is co-indexed with the word elephant. They refer to the same thing. So now we can model our relative clause sentence like this: 

In short we need to be careful about confusing word categories and functions/grammatical relations. These two things are entirely different. 

Here we see the word who occurring directly to the left of the nucleus (the main body) of the clause containing the gap. The long string that awful nit-picking man with the bobbly hat and the stripy shoes is just the subject of the verb punch. Because it is long it has moved the gap further away from its antecedent who. But nonetheless, the word who occurs here directly behind the very clause containing the gap. We can compare that to (5): 

(In the sentence above we might not feel that Bob has moved to the beginning of the clause from another position, exactly. It is more as if a second Bob has been deleted from the end of the smaller clause. Again, this would depend on what kind of grammar you subscribe to.) Now it is the relationship between these gaps and the words or phrases that they depend on for their interpretation which we refer to as long distance dependencies. Why do we call them long distance dependencies? Well, for one thing, these gaps are non-adjacent to their antecedents. We could suppose that we could measure the distance between the antecedent phrase and the gap itself to see how long distance this dependency was. So consider the following sentences: 

I was told here several times, that a part of speech is not universal, but specific for each language as much as the A,T,C and G's are in everyone's genome. Nethertheless, occasionally the same terms are used for in different languages for practical reasons, e.g. Adjective in English and Japanese, even though they are similar but not equal in all respects. But what if you compare the parts of speeches of thousands of languages? Is it still the case, that no two languages have identical parts of speeches or could it be, that there is a limit for specific ones? To draw an analogy, each language possess a subset of all phonetic sounds possible across all languages as described in the IPA chart, but the number of all sounds possible would have a limit, even if millions of languages existed. Is there something like an IPA of the parts of speeches or another approach to describe parts of speeches with a closed set of universal features? 

There is an article on Tenseness in Wikipedia, but it is on the Tenseness of vowels, nethertheless it is describing the articulatory way of production well: widened mouth, less open, uplift tongue. How about the Tenseness of consonants, what exactly is happening inside the the mouth and beyond, what is happening in the articulatory system in order to create them? 

The 'sentence' above will seem odd if not ungrammatical to most English speakers because the verb like usually requires an Object. Such an Object is missing from the phrase above. We cannot use like with its normal meaning without a Direct Object in a straightforward clause: 

In traditional grammar the verb BE was considered as a main verb (or lexical verb) when used on its own in a sentence. It was only considered an auxiliary when it was used as part of a passive construction or a continuous construction. However, we now understand that auxiliaries are a grammatical class of words that have the same grammatical properties. Lexical or main verbs do not share these properties. But the verb BE usually does, even when it is the only verb in the sentence. Auxiliary verbs The important central properties which characterise auxiliary verbs are sometimes referred to as NICE properties. NICE is an acronym for: 

The term "gerund" is a fudge. It is used as if it was a subcategory of verb, when in fact, of course, it is just a particular inflected form of a given verb. Worse than this, this pseudo part of speech, in English at least, is actually 25% a part of speech and 50% a grammatical function label. The reason for this is that people who differentiate between "gerunds" and "participles" (meaning, with regard to English, "present participles") do so on the basis of the words' grammatical relations. So whenever this form of verb is the head of a clause used as a subject or object of a verb or the complement of a preposition, they deem it a gerund. Whenever it is the head of a clause used as a modifier or as the complement of the verb BE in a continuous construction, they deem it a participle. Of course this is to try and differentiate a different form of a verb according to its grammatical function and not its form. Modern English grammars such as The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002) deem this distinction unjustifiable, and refer to such inflected forms as gerund-participles regardless of their grammatical relations. Notice though that this is a label like plain form or past participle and does not refer to a part of speech in any way. Notice that gerund-participles are verbs regardless of whether they function as a subjects or objects or modifiers. For example, unlike nouns they take objects: 

In korean, consonants are divided into three categories of articulation or coarticulation, one of them is called Tenseness. In korean orthography, tensed consonants are written with a reduplicated consonant sign. In IPA orthography, they are written with a pair of vertical parallel lines at the bottom of the letter: 

The question points in the future and so I see the problem of having evidence but an educated guess or quotations of linguists would do, I guess. It is no secret any longer, though some nationalist Turks I know, passionate advocates of the Sun Language Theory, see it differently, languages have changed through time. Not quiet randomly, but by rules which historical linguists have discovered. However, times are different know : We ve have Jackie Chan, Star Wars, oppressive governments, prescriptive language advocates, the Kings James Bible, constitutions, TV series and all the things which urges us to speak their way either for entertainment to understand what Yoda said in plain English, for our constitutional rights to know how to read the laws and thus to know how to sit on a leather chair sponsored by welfare money instead the electrical one and all other modern reasons which keep our language in a specific shape like dinosaurs eyewitnessing mosquitoes in amber. So, what is the opinion on this the scientists came up with? 

They can be very similar to and sometimes the same as main clause or subordinate clause open interrogatives: 

There is a good rule for determining whether to use a [j] (like the first sound in yes) or [w] to link two words like this. The first thing you need to know is that the choice depends on the first vowel and not the second. Therefore in terms of the Original Poster's question, the choice is determined by /i/ at the end of the word be, and not by the beginning of the word ok. Now if the first vowel is either a high front vowel, for example /i/ or a diphthong ending in a high front vowel, in other words /eɪ, aɪ, ɔɪ/, then we need to use a /j/ to link the words. If you think about it, [j] is phonetically like a high front vowel. It is the same type of sound. So this kind of makes sense. On the other hand [w] is phonetically like a high back vowel. When the first word ends in a high back vowel such as /u/, or with a diphthong that ends in a high back vowel such as /oʊ/ or /aʊ/, then we use a [w] to link the two vowels. If the vowel is not a high vowel, or doesn't end in a high vowel, then you may find linking with a glottal stop, [ʔ], in Gen Am. In non-rhotic Englishes (those which don't have /r/ in the coda of the syllable) such as British RP, you will often find /r/ used to link a non-high vowel with a following vowel. 

In another question someone pointed out, that at least some slavic languages use word order to express the grammatical category of definitiveness. For instance in Polish: This example has been flagged by some as incorrect, but my expertise is too limited to evaluate 

I understand the field or fields have to be quiet extensive, therefore I don't ask for a description, but rather a list of the names of the linguistic subfields, theories and significant people dealing with it, maybe with short annotations. 

At this point I don't want to explain my personal crackpot theories on how names for numbers emerged and I assume that anything remotely connected with the origin of language is highly speculative and hard if not impossible being researched empirically. Nethertheless, centuries of speculation might have culminated into a few theories which might be considered an educated guess or even more. Here I limit the theories onto the origin of the names for numerals, what probably doesn't make it much easier. 

I used to start learning a few languages, admittingly my interest ,stamina and brain force didn't last for more than a couple of days each. Nethertheless, I noticed , that the different grammars explained clauses being divided into Subject and Verbs as their minimal requirements. Now, Subject is a sentence part and verb is a part of speach, furthermore other definitions of clauses name Subject and Predicative as the minimal requirements for a clause , which is a blessing feeling of absence of cognitive dissonance since in this case both are sentence parts. But why is it so? 

This is often referred to as dealveolar assimilation, because the consonant is moving away from its normal alveolar position, to effectively become a different consonant. The Original poster's question: There will be no elision of the /d/ in this environemt. However we are likely to get dealveolar assimilation. Because this consonant will now be homorganic (made with the same parts of the mouth) with the following /p/, it will not be released and may be less easy to hear. There will also be some devoicing of the /d/ because of the following voiceless /p/, and so it may appear more /p/-like. 

In the sentence above from the Robocop films the word somewhere is functioning as a Locative Adjunct. Notice that it can appear either at the beginning or end of the clause: 

[Please note that in the end this is not essentially a question about English!] Intervocalic /t/ in Gen Am English may be realised as a voiced alveolar tap, [ɾ]. In words like entertain or ninety where the /t/ occurs after an /n/, it is also often voiced in General American. Given that the nasal stop, /n/, usually involves a full blockage of the air leaving the vocal tract, and that a canonical /t/ is homorganic with a canonical /n/, it is reasonable to suppose that the realisation of the voiced /t/ might actually be an alveolar plosive instead of a tap. So my first question is: is it? Of course, I'm aware that the /nt/ sequence in such words may actually be reduced to a single nasal tap, but I'm only interested in the situation where the /n/ and /t/ are both realised. My second question, however, is whether it's actually possible for a tap to follow directly on from a (nasal or aural) stop made with the same articulators. So, for example, is it even physically possible for [ɾ] to follow an 'unreleased' alveolar [t]? And is it possible for [ɾ] to directly follow an /n/ if the tongue does not lose contact with the alveolar ridge between the two segments? 

Is there a field of linguistics which deals with analyzing them and establishing grammatical characteristics for each type of text. Maybe, after a statistical evaluation of text types and comparison with each other one could come up with stable or frequent characteristics for each text type, perhaps differences like: 

Now I don't know if this contradicts some basic principle in linguistics, but a friend of mine,Aslan, who admittingly tends to be a crackpot, but has also proven to be smart, claims, that this is the case in one of the Balkan languages he speaks. The example I provide is necessarily just wrong grammar I had to make up, to exemplify what I mean. 

As for the languages I know I think to believe, that a subordinated clause comes in a chunk and not scattered throughout the main clause. For instance: 

Do you know futher examples of languages with free word order, highly flectional languages like Balto-Slavic, Ancient Greek or Sanskrit or agglutinative languages like Korean and Japanese with a free word order except for the predicate or others that use word order to convey some additional meaning? 

Let me clarify the question, There are traditional grammars to describe the working and structure of languages, mostly with the purpose of teaching someone to speak the languages. So, it is approach is simply educative and theoretical inconsistencies within the grammar used are neglected , it only has to work as a teaching instrument. Then, there are descriptions of languages with the purpose of describing them for further linguistic evaluations. Maybe to have a common system of description to compare languages with one another, to group them according to some criteria, to follow their development through time by observing its change of grammar, to describe their structure precisely for computational evaluation and so forth. Now, at this point I don't know how deep an answer to this question can get, if it is too comprehensive, please try to point out some relevant differences. 

Again, how you wished to measure the 'distance' of the dependency relationship would depend on what exactly you were trying to show. 

Most transcription systems allow for white space between words. This is just to make the transcription easier to read. It is not for any kind of punctuation reason. When a group of scholars decide upon a convention for representing the phonemes of a particular language in language-specific, phonemic transcriptions, they may sometimes choose one symbol over another because it more closely resembles the orthography. So, whereas Southern Standard British English /e/ is in between [e] and [ɛ], most authorities use /e/ as opposed to /ɛ/ to represent the phoneme because this is how the phoneme is most often 'represented' in the orthography. This it is felt, will make life easier for learners of English, who will have to use these transcriptions in dictionaries and language learning materials. When used in written essays about phonetics or phonology, lists of phones or phonemes are often separated within their brackets by commas. The comma does not feature as an IPA diacritic and so serves to show that we are talking about a list of discrete phones or phonemes and not a string of sound or a string of phonemes. So people tend to write [p, t, k] or /p, t, k/, for example, as opposed to /p/, /t/, /k/ and so on.
