I think the problematic word is "currency". If that word were changed to "investment" then you could easily have a situation like the Dutch Tulip Mania that occurred in the 1600s. An investor class awash in money and looking for unexploited niches to return fast cash could create a bubble out of almost anything (for a while), even living things like flower bulbs. But currency alone doesn't actually have value. It's just paper that we agree has a value. We use it for convenience, but it evolved as a receipt for a commodity. In ancient times that was grain in storage, but later it was a banknote serving as a receipt for a bank account. Currency isn't the thing of value, it's the convenient token you carry that represents the value. Your "bitcoin rat" would have actual value. Its scarcity and steady reproduction would guarantee inflation. It's durability and un-counterfietability would make them very reliable longterm investments. The very wealthy might have rats to spend, but the average middle class shopkeeper would still use paper and coin currency. 

Temperature, because they are a reptile species with temperature-dependent sex determination. The eggs that are too warm or too cold become males. Eggs in the goldilocks zone become female. 

The heads may not be limited to types of food, but for any reason heads evolve: to set a pair of eyes further apart and higher, another head for hunting underwater, maybe one head just to attract a mate (that one wouldn't need to eat or think, just look attractive), and another head for communicating. At birth the heads might not be differentiated. 

In an Electric Universe, where space is plasma soup and electromagnetism is the "magic" that can defeat the laws of physics, all stars are connected by invisible Birkland currents. Picture the rope that forms when you touch a plasma ball: 

The Navy is the gung-ho American-style "humans first" military. More heart than brains, more firepower than diplomatic nuance, but guys and gals you'd want to have a beer with. They have varied (sometimes conflicted) feelings about Sentient AI. They aren't luddites (there's a regular AI on board for navigation) but building an AI to have it's own opinions and motivations is a little "creepy" and "dangerous". How could you ever trust it? The Sentient Android is a "Ninotchka" a dry-humor cold war frenemy. She's from a union of star systems governed by AI. Under rigid management, they are approaching post-scarcity but they converted all habitable planets to farm-only clean worlds and moved humans to climate controlled space habitats. From the Navy's POV, she represents an ideology where humans have surrendered to machines in exchange for safety and comfort. These sentient AI are their next-generation. Her abilities are unknown. The Pirate has exposed weaknesses in the local proxy government which is collapsing. In the ensuing power vacuum he has elevated his Robin Hood status to a potential warlord who can fight back against space colonialism. His reputation is rapidly changing from intergalactic criminal to freedom fighter. Navy brass is looking for a surgical solution, not an escalation of conflict. 

To paraphrase the question: once this "illness" happens, what ability do we lose. OK, by whatever measure, we are half the species we were before, but some individuals would still have all the relative advantages of money and status, corporations would still participate in groupthink, and a genius halved is still a genius when everyone else is also halved. Society stays stratified and probably in the same order as before. Social institutions and governments would remain. But in general, people would be more passionate. Quicker to anger. Fickle in love. Art and culture would regress to slapstick and teen melodrama. Politics and education would suffer, as well as engineering and science. It would be putting the breaks on innovation and social reform. There would be more car accidents, job-related injuries, medical misdiagnoses. There's no way to put a number on it, but your mortality rate would soar. 

I don't think I could give you a figure, but assume I was a general in the army and I had a a thousand of soldiers to look after. Many supermarkets have large storage facilities for the food they sell. I would send scouts to the nearest and then attack and displace any other scavengers. (We take this Sam's Club for the glory of the nation). Once food is secure for a few months, I'd send scout parties looking for professionals: doctors, engineers, and nuclear physicists. I would offer them and their families safety and food in exchange for their services. The next and harder part is to get the energy. Many wind mills might work after the nuclear disasters and I could use them to power my new settlement to some extent. If I find a few decent engineers to help with that, it should be a piece of cake. If not, we'll keep raiding the nearby university libraries in search for PhD students who didn't get the memo that there was a nuclear disaster. If I can get nuclear engineers and physicists, and especially if I can find a nuclear plant that hasn't been destroyed in the attack, I could try restarting it. It might not be trivial with all the infrastructure destruction, but my scientists could find a solution and I could enslave a bunch of people to help me build the missing parts. Once the abundant source of energy is found, we could raid seed banks, or even get seeds from Walmart and grow plants the way Lt. Smith used to grow pot under UV light in his apartment in LA. Some agricultural engineers could help us with that. Even if nuclear energy is not available, and the oil, gas and wind energy we can scavenge is not enough for this type of farming, we can grow mushrooms (portobello, pleurotus), and some plants that don't need too much sunlight, like ferns. We can get our farm animals (goats) to eat these plants, and we will thrive on meat and mushrooms. We can also farm dogs since the dog food from the supermarket will last us for a while. The best dogs will be attack dogs, while the rest will be tasty. The size of the colony will depend a lot on how soon we secure access to food, energy and trained personnel. I think three thousand of people should be the order of magnitude for the colony. There should be minimum 100 soldiers available at any time for raids, and about a thousand for defense, especially from other organized groups. With three thousand people, the colony will last long enough, until the nuclear winter ends. 

Pitchforks are actually decent as spears, but they can be blocked easier. In middle ages, people also used scythes. They also used sickles, and even put them on poles. More effective than shovels, I think you could use hoes. Clubs were also easy to make and were extensively used by peasants. The weapon effectiveness depends a lot on the terrain and enemy. A pitchfork would work great against a knight, a scythe would seriously injure an unarmored foe. A pole ending with a sickle would be great to pull a knight off his horse. I remember that in Eastern Europe peasants were sometimes drafted to the army, and used farm tools as weapons because that was all they had. They said they dug ditches and sprang to attack cavalry. Apparently they slashed the legs of horses with scythes. I have not found a link for this reference, but there is a question on SE dealing with use of scythes in battle here. 

In case of tornadoes, the scouts of the army are disguised as storm watchers. They ride in big SUVs and follow the tornadoes to the town. When the time is right they give the signal. The data from the weather satellites is collected by a supercomputing center in Alabama to which the enemy has access because they bribed some employees or they are blackmailing them, or they simply hacked into it since the sysadmin is the son of the governor and is quite incompetent. Using their relatively well optimized machine learning algorithm, stolen from a silly professor at Stanford, whom they had the foresight to kill, the enemy can predict with a 50 percent accuracy where the tornadoes will strike. The strike happens just as the tornadoes mops through the city. Ten large army helicopters bring the strike team with all the tools at the outskirts of the city, where the tornado won't touch down, and do the damage as follows. They destroy the statue of the most revered historical figure in town, they shoot rockets in the Shopping Mall, they smear with radioactive waste the entrances to the main bank buildings. Then they ride back their motorcycles to the helicopters and leave in full glory. At all times during the attack, the storm watchers give the attackers the information on how to stay out of the tornado's way. You could imagine a similar scenario with an earthquake. Only this time the ground attack can be replaced by some nice carpet bombing. It's harder to argue that a supercomputer gathering seismic data would ever predict earthquakes, but another group at UCLA works on such a grant offered by a mysterious organization (the enemy). The enemy uses data to predict earthquakes and speculate on the stock market. They attack the afflicted areas only to destroy food and fresh water supply with the thought to make those people refugees. They come dressed as FEMA guys hell bent on making their country great. 

My habitat ring is constructed in orbit around a planet with disconnected sections: (not to scale, obviously) 

Since our Barber-Surgeon is so famous and successful he is designated the head of the guild. Naturally he brings his lovely wife (or possibly devoted housekeeper if she is so inclined) and she introduces the strange ideas of hand washing and hygiene to the training. Those who follow the strict rules have patients who heal better, and after a decade of professional resistance many doctors and patients accept there must be some "common sense" in hygiene, and the concept eventually spills over into other professions and sciences. 

It can be reconfigured by an artist using some kind of nano-manipulator brush, so colors, designs, patterns can be altered with a trip to the beauty spa (it never looks like "natural" skin). The synth skin can filter nitrogen bubbles from her blood, giving her an advantage when diving or changing atmospheres. She can withstand sulfuric acid vapor in the atmosphere (like the cloud deck of Venus) with only a gas mask (small emergency oxygen mask?), long enough to perform a physical activity outside that would kill (or severely burn) everyone else. She can't get drunk or high, at least not for very long before the skin filters it from her blood. Synth skin cells eventually "die" and must be replaced with new seed injections of the nano-virus into deeper skin. Most of her synth skin however is damaged in one incident, exposure to cold, and is replaced with new and improved™ synth skin. She spends about 9 months in medical suspended animation while it regrows. She improbably survives (<1 minute) inside an electro-plasma magnetic foundry fusion doohickey thanks to the Leidenfrost effect or a plasma double-layer or maybe an electrostatic sheath. 

Solar storms. "Streams of particles launched from the sun in the solar wind increase the number of lightning strikes on Earth by 32%." From the article: "Activity on the sun significantly increases the rate of lightning strikes on Earth, say researchers, making it feasible to predict when lightning strikes will become more frequent. They discovered that when streams of high-speed solar particles strike the Earth's atmosphere, the average number of lightning strikes increased by 32% for more than a month afterwards. The study is the first to implicate the solar wind – the stream of particles launched from the sun at over a million miles per hour – in triggering lightning, a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists." The original paper is here: $URL$ In summary: it was previously assumed that galactic cosmic rays (GCR) was a source of lightning, and the solar wind helped shield the Earth from their effects, however the study which included 16 years of data shows the opposite effect. For 4 to 5 days after a solar event the amount of lightning drops, but that is followed by a period between 8 and 40 days after the solar event where lightning activity increases. The researchers suggest some mechanisms involving the solar wind alone, and the solar wind interacting with GCR, but they admit they do not know the actual reason. 

This video shows many examples of "weird" behavior when a magnet encounters a copper plate, including braking and damping. $URL$ In this scenario, only the surface of the water experiences magnetic braking and damping. The larger globs of water have more mass-to-surface ratio and behaves more like regular water, but smaller drops might suspend longer in the air, and interact with other small globs to align into threads and filaments. The strongest ion field the foam is likely to encounter is the plasma "skin" of a larger body of water, hence the electrified foam will filament and float above a body of water for a second or two as it navigates through the water's ion field. If you want to push the electrical effect your foam might even have the occasional glow or electrical spark.
