Hide the sun. If you find a way to completely block the sunlight to shine on a planet, you can be sure every life form should disappear quickly. 

They don't filter, so they don't hear while flying. To not hear is obviously a weakness, as they couldn't hear neither close predators noises, nor shout from other species member that would want to yield a danger. However, to fly is a much better advantage. For small animals of this size, there are many carnivorous animals stuck on ground that would stop to be a threat as long as they are airborne. And even if the noise would probably alert and attract many other predators around, your creature would simply have to fly on an upper position, like a tree, to be safe for a while. In order to communicate together while flying, maybe they could develop a new form of language rather than noises. They can for instance develop a 3D movement code, like bees waggle dance. 

I've got a planet similar to Earth, with three species rising from prehistoric nomadic life to sedentary civilizations at the same time and learning speed, but in three different living environments: 

I have a planet with homogeneous core and mantle, but a thick crust separated in two parts: the north half is composed of water and the south part is an alloy of heavy metals, making the north lighter than the south. What would be consequences on planet shape? The usual - not perfect - spherical form is generated because of gravity, but here, the gravity center would be slightly offbeat because of surface height heavier on a side compared to another. I know that an effect (if any) would be very slight considering the implication of the crust in global planet weight, but I'm still curious of details. 

So finally, I think magic and technology can help each other to progress. They are complementary, as technology is longer to prepare for usage but magic is an energy eater. So yes, technology and science shall evolve to modern standards, and probably further. 

They all omnivorous creatures, and have enough food on their respective living environment, and anyway would get few - but still a little bit of - food from another living environment. Their environment fit quite good for their respective natural liver, but they wouldn't be able to live in another. (As humans wouldn't have any reason to prefer to live underwater rather than on ground) So they basically don't have any good reason to colonize another living environment. They have all the same aggressiveness and imperialism level: the one of human kind. My question is: as none of them is a direct threat for the others, at least not for territory quest, what their relations would be ? Would one of their kind seek more wars with themselves or with one of the two other civilization ? 

I have a world with many gods. They don't like each others, so they want to destroy each others. Problem: they are immortal. Solution: they will create another world, with different civilizations (probably one for each of them) and force war between them in order to let battles results decide of the winner(s). But just to watch is not very fun, so they would like to be able to interfere in middle of battles as well, with mass-destruction spells in an enemy battalion for instance. The new problem is all of them have an almost unlimited power, as well for their civilizations creation as for offensive spells. One of them can set the entire world ablaze if he wants, provoking the destruction of everyone ; or alternatively making his creatures almost invincible. So they need a set of rules in order to make the game long and "enjoyable" by everyone (or rather every god). They need a set of rules for this "game" in order to keep fair-play and equality between them. Assuming they will all accept and respect this set of rules once set, what could it be ? 

But forget about that. If gravity goes down, the atmosphere becomes less dense. Which would have a big effect on winds, oxygen levels (thus plant growth, animal life, etc. etc.). Temperatures would go down, further hurting plant and animal life, which likely has even greater negative effects as it would mean more desert style areas. 

Let's draw on the works of John Norman, creator of the Gor universe, which has exactly that and without the magic. In his world there are swarms of airborn cavalry and raiders, human beings flying giant birds of prey and armed with swords, spears, and crossbows, plus lasso and bolo style devices to capture people (usually women to be carried off as slaves). Cities employ archers on their walls, flying patrols of their own to intercept raiders, and giant nets of thin metal wire strung between towers over the city to deter the raiders and prevent them from landing (the raiders can carry a number of troops holding on to rope ladders to insert into the target city). 

Styxal's answer is but one part of the story. The colouration is however not affected only by temperature but also by chemical composition. This means that if through some means you could have your planet have a markedly different chemical balance in the northern as compared to the southern hemisphere (possibly combined with different temperatures) you might end up with a planet that appears to have different colours between the hemispheres. However, this is harder than you might think. How are you going to prevent diffusion of parts of the atmosphere, eventually homogenising the entire ball into one more or less consistent chemical cocktail? You'd need some very strange wind patterns near the equator, and going down very deep into the atmosphere to prevent that happening, patterns I'm far from convinced could ever develop long term in nature even on a far smaller scale than that. 

The virus used there seemed believable, and the distribution method ingenious. Little spoiler: he went for a genetically hardened version of Ebola, with a very clever way of distributing it (which I won't mention, read the book). He touches on the same issue in Executive Orders, using a completely different distribution system. 

About the minimum you'd need is what the Germans had available to them during WW2. Their A4/V2 rocket was nominally capable of reaching space (though not of orbiting) and they were working on designs of a functional spaceplane that would fly a suborbital trajectory to the US to drop bombs there and then skip over the atmosphere back to Germany. More capable rockets were under development that would have been able to launch men or satellites into space (though that was not the primary consideration at the time) in the form of the A9/A10. As to fuels, liquid oxygen + kerosene does the trick just fine. You don't need "advanced chemicals". The biggest problem would be navigation and creating and maintaining a pressure capsule and a breathable atmosphere within it. For navigation, someone with a slide rule and enough paper and time wouldn't need much more than a sextant and maybe a telescope. The biggest problem with the pressure capsule is making air tight seals that don't fail in vacuum. Plastics, artificial rubbers, and things like that are the most used for that, maybe other things can work as well. And then there's the problem of maintaining the breathable atmosphere on board. Spacecraft use CO2 scrubbers which need some knowledge of osmosis and processes like that to construct. If you go longer, you might need a means to reduce CO2 to oxygen and carbon so you can reuse the oxygen for longer. Again, nothing we couldn't do in the 1940s. Bronze pressure vessels can probably work, but the mass may be higher than a comparable internal volume in steel. 

It would cause the price of gold to crash, making your pile of gold essentially worthless. Others would gobble it up and then slowly filter it back into the market as the gold price stabilises, making a killing. Which is what you should have done yourself in the first place of course... This isn't limited to gold, it goes for any commodity. The question is discussed in some detail in discussions about the viability of asteroid mining, where it is sometimes suggested that the haul in precious metals from a single large asteroid would quickly be able to pay for the cost of the entire operation by just dumping it on the market. For all the reasons already mentioned, that's not how it works. You'd rather have to release those tons of rare materials (platinum for example) in small batches, say a few percent of the yearly demand, unless maybe you were to at the same time introduce a new and highly lucrative use for those materials, which would increase demand to the point where a high market price can be sustained despite a greatly increased supply. 

The scenario is the following: a civilization with technology level similar to humanity's current, on a planet similar to Earth, shall be hit by a massive celestial body in approximately one year. The impact would be around three times more powerful than the one that caused the end of dinosaurs, but still not enough to completely destroy the planet. The civilization know about it one year before impact, and know precisely when and where it would crash. My question is: what would be the best way to save as most people as possible ? Is there a way to destroy the asteroid ? or at least to damage it and reduce the impact strength ? Else, what kind of preparations could be efficient, for the impact itself as well as adaptation to what the planet and its life forms would become after it ? Is there a chance of long-term survival at all ? I wonder as much for the explosion (or waves, depending if the asteroid crash on land or on ocean) as for consequences for potential survivors: animal and vegetable kingdom would be shaken, so if a large group survives, could a civilization rebuild just after? 

Religions were made in ancient ages and earned their "success" partially by bringing two kind of answers that couldn't be found at these times, like how the world was created, how human race emerged, etc. With a 24th century technology and knowledge level, it would be hard to do the same, especially for an AI, that would be more rational than a human and would prefer have a scientific answer than anything else to a problem. However, a religion derivative that made victims since antiquity has still success today: sects. The main difference is that their leaders don't even trust themselves their own directives, but use it on credulous people to steal their money and/or freedom. This strategy could be used on artificial intelligences. On two ways: By humans A human - or group of humans - could persuade an AI for anything to be true, by hacking or manipulation, and convince it to do anything. It can then use it as bodyguards or slaves if AI think this human is a divine entity, or, in a better way, make it think that its only purpose is to serve humans and to never attack them. So this strategy could be used as well for a good purpose as for a bad one. By another AI Some humans manipulate other ones and persuaded them to do absolutely anything they want. It is possible for a smart and resourceful AI, with probably high hacking skills, to do the same with its fellows. This time, it would probably be for the worst: an AI starting to manipulate other ones for its own purposes is probably a rogue one, and it looks like a good start for a science-fiction story scenario. 

I think this is a key point. The weakest men and women would feel useless if they cannot try something else than magic. So I think they would be the best engineers/scientists, eager to prove their values. They would use their little power to increase their potential and making experiences to make technology progress. 

So magic can be used to improve technology. To make and use a research laboratory on any science topic is really easier than in your world than in our. 

... Where technology doesn't. Take one of the technology improvement that ended the middle age: navigation. If I understand your world, magic can be used to cross large water bodies. But to travel - and transport commodities - through oceans is not at all a "simple things", so if it is possible, it would be only by the magic masters of your world. On the opposite, a caravel made by engineers (who, once again, could have used magic to make it) would be able to travel as many times as it want with less energy. And on board, sailors can use their own power to make the ship travel faster, or the travel itself more comfortable by making food appear, etc.
