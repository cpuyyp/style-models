1 - Arrowheads from North America at this time tend to be "fluted" to allow for extra blood flow from the target. Probably worth the effort when the target weighs a ton or more, but the fluting stopped when the large herbivores died out. 2 - Guns, Germs, & Steel (required reading) makes the case that large African and Asian species had the advantage of evolving alongside the Homo species, and thus having some chance to adapt as their hunting capabilities slowly improved. American species got introduced cold to fully-modern humans with Neolithic hunting technology. 

For a public (non family) display of such a flag, like say in the middle of Manhattan, placing an appropriate number of stars would have been problematic, so I could see where they might have left the middle blank. These days Congress has solved that problem by prohibiting anyone but immediate family from displaying one. They didn't have that law yet in the '40's though, and the flags were so ubiquitous in homes that I can see where it may have come to be viewed as a general "support our boys" flag. In fact, I think one can probably view these flags during WWII as announcing "We support our troops", with whatever is placed in the middle designating what the person has invested. This explains why the same motif was used for the Liberty Loan flags you found, as well as for the Victory loans flag. 

The ancient Egyptians at the time of the Rhind Papyrus didn't really have the concept of Pi. The method they described for finding the area of a circle was to inscribe it within a square, and apply the ratio of 64/81 to the area within the square. However, we know today this is mathematically equivalent to using a Pi of 256/81. That's a hair smaller than 3.1605, which on Wikipedia's timeline page amounts to having it right to one decimal place. The Ancient Babylonians and Indians at roughly the same time had their own heuristics which worked out to a Pi of 3 + 1/8 and 25/8 respectively, or 3.125 (exactly). That was a wee bit closer, but also accurate to only one decimal place. Nobody else is known to have widely established a significantly better estimate until Archimedes' 2 decimal places nearly 2000 years later. The paper you linked is making several speculations and extrapolating from them. I don't wanna give the guy short shrift: they are some fascinating speculations. I find the idea of the pyramid builders rolling around a trundle wheel to plot out the four corners particularly compelling. But at its base that paper is just a lot of personal speculation and math fun, built around a core of historical and mathematical fact. It is of course quite possible to be using Pi without knowing it; that's exactly what our trundle wheel users would have been doing. There was an Egyptologist who argued as early as 1940 that the Egyptians were also using 22/7, but that argument does not appear to be widely accepted today. I'm not sure how closely his arguments match to the paper you linked. 

Digging deeper, a lot of that level seems to correlate strongly with outside factors. The upward spikes they show either correspond to major wars, or one of the two great recessions. The only serious exception to this rule appears to be the steady rise (not a spike) under the Reagan administration's implementation of supply-side economics. 

Lots of people will tell you that Elder Futhark, the old Runic alphabet, had a rune for Loki. However, some say it was Dagaz and some say it was Kenaz, and one other answer here (unique to the Internet, as near as I can tell), says it was Berkanan (ᛒ). 

Non-violent resistance doesn't mean there won't be violence (including possibly death) happening. It just means you won't be the one committing it. In fact, it is the goal to induce the oppressor to respond with violence, to draw everyone's attention to the fact that they have no authority over the situation other than brute force. As an example, I give you the Dharasana Salt March, which I can't describe any better than today's Wikipedia entry on it: 

I have in the past seen claims that human activity, specifically overgrazing by domestic goats and salinification of the water table by repeated irrigation, has been responsible for the advance of the desert into previously habitable areas of North Africa. That's a far cry from your book's reported claim, but its at least a nod in that direction. It appears that a temporary change in the monsoon rain pattern at that latitude caused the Sahara to temporarily become habitable from about 10,000 to 5,000 BP. Scientists have given it the rather uninspiring name Neolithic Subpluvial. Supposedly some inscriptions in Egypt and the Sudan depict this. Here's an article in Live Science from 2006 that discusses the matter. However, before that time the Sahara was actually larger than it is now. So we are still better off that where we started before the monsoon aberration, and can probably expect it to go back toward that larger size, human activity or no. There are theories that these changes just happen periodically. I found an article in The Globalist from 2008 that makes the slightly less extravagant claim that human activity accelerated the re-desertification process when the rains went away. So this is an idea that is floating around. I don't know how widely-accepted it is though. Coincidentally, I also heard a story on NPR this morning about "carnivorists", or scientists who study carnivores. They do make the claim that taking carnivores out of an ecosystem can lead to large changes in the vegetation. Still, we find deserts naturally worldwide in regions where rainfall is less than about 250mm a year. At its current northern limit, the Sahara receives about 100mm a year, and 150 at it southern. So I think it is fair to say that it would be a desert, regardless of what the animals around it are doing. 

Hmmm. I find that "citation needed" to be a bit confusing. If it relates to the claim of prior invention, that is cited from La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso right there, and David Kahn's book The Codebreakers later in the article. So the claim seems to be pretty well attributed to me. It almost looks like its saying they want a citation for the claim that it "is now widely known as the "Vigenère cipher". I'm not sure how one would cite such a claim, and frankly if you aren't prepared to take its truth as a given, then you shouldn't be reading a wikipedia page for it. (Confused yet?) If you go look at Bellaso's wikipedia page, it does refer to a disagreement between the two, along with some other people (not Vigenère) taking credit for Ballaso's work. 

It appears the acquittal only happened in 2014. That's 6 years from raid to resolution. There's a lot more good information in that article about the process. 

So basically, there was clearly some kind of joint culture within that region, centered on Tiwanaku. But they don't know if it was a full on military empire (like say the Asyrian empire), or more or a colonial-type relationship, like the 8 BC Greek Diaspora. 

Following up on Tom's answer, there is actually a reason there was a large white minority in South Africa, but not in India. The Bantu peoples (of which most living native South Africans are descendents) spread across most of Sub-Saharan Africa in large part due to having an agricultural package that worked well for that tropical climate. In particular, millet and sorghum. Indian agriculture was heavily reliant on tropical/subtropical rice and millet crops. European agriculture was heavily reliant on temperate and Mediterranean crops like wheat and barley. Keeping that in mind, look at the world climate map below: 

I think this question is conflating two things: whether Columbus thought he had found the Indies, and whether he thought he might have also discovered a new continent. 

There's (surprisingly to me) a rather extensive Wikipedia page on this subject. The main takeaway I got from it is that merely bombing the rail lines without bombing the camps themselves was not considered to be a particularly effective option. Bombing the camps was fairly extensively discussed at high levels (even consulting with Jewish community representatives). It was worried that not only would that also kill the internees, but it was quite likely the Germans would turn around and try to blame all the death camp deaths on the allied bombings. At lower levels, it appears that it was Army policy to bomb only military targets, so such requests made through military channels were typically rejected without ever going up the chain far enough to reach a politician. 

No, they didn't. From their point of view there was now a hostile anti-South majority in Congress. Any attempt by themselves to do things to protect slavery through US Congressional action was doomed to failure. So there was no reason to bother trying. The closest thing they had was allied Copperheads, Northern Democrats who felt the issue wasn't worth going to war over. 

I will add on my own that if this is accurate, Ogarkov would have been drastically overstating the situation with commercial computers. In 1981 the state-of-the art home computers in the USA were Apple II's and Atari 800's. These were command-line based machines that really smart kids could use, but not toddlers. They sold for the modern equivalent of about $5,000. So by 1981 there would have been some but certianly not a lot of recruits joining the military who had experience using one. However, when the Mac came out in 1984, yes toddlers could use it*. So you could argue the part about 3-year-olds was prescient exaggeration on Ogarkov's part, or an anachronism likely inserted by Gelb. * - I can say this first hand. I had an Atari 800, and my parents bought one of the first Macs in 1984. My 4-year-old baby sister loved MacPaint, but her involvement with my previous computers consisted mostly of sneaking into my room while I was sleeping and gleefully unspooling my cassette tapes. 

Actually, others had not failed. 30 years earlier Ivan Ashen II had also driven the Mongols out of Bulgaria. The mountainous terrain in the central spine of the country makes it not the best terrain for the Mongol way of warfare, and totally unsuitable for their pastoral way of life. So the country was really only good for them for occasional raiding. The reason the Mongols were back was because after Ivan the monarchy was weak, and had resorted to paying the Mongols tribute rather than fighting them. This worked OK for the upper classes, but obviously not so great for the peasantry. 

However, the Kansas-Nebraska act only covered the Kansas and Nebraska Territories. Iowa and Missouri were already states by this time, but that still left some territory in the former and not the latter. 

According to wikipedia, the current title for the earliest documented use would be the Hittites with the bacterial disease Tularemia in the mid second millenium BC. According to the texts, infected people were sent into enemy territory to help spread the plague there. 

I can't resist pointing out some interesting timing with domestication though. The current inter-glacial period we are living in started about 11,700 years ago. The earliest evidence we have of agriculture? Also 11,000 years ago. Of course that's just (circumstantial) evidence of a correlation, not a causation. However, this is certainly what it would look like if mankind was poised for this genetically, and the Neolithic breakthrough was merely awaiting weather conditions that made agriculture a relatively worthwhile effort. Likewise, the appearance of multiple independent writing systems in densely-habitated agricultural areas all over the globe looks an awful lot like writing is just something a society naturally has a good chance of developing, once it reaches a certain size. 

The Fertile Crescent actually gets a respectable amount of rain. However, it tends to get it all in 4 months in the Winter. The rest of the year it is bone-dry. Then in the spring they get runoff from however much snow the Zagros and Taurus mountains managed to accumulate in those 4 months, again all at once. So, unlike the Nile valley, the Tigris and Euphrates floods were not predictable at all. When they did flood, the floods tended to be really, really bad. This is generally held to have had an effect on the psychology of Mesopotamian society, making the people quite anxious and pessimistic. 

The following is taken from my dog-eared copy of the New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History. However, the source numbers supposedly come from Colin McEvedy's Atlas of World Population History (which I sadly don't have a copy of. Hint to Santa). One thing to note is that, since the full advent of the Neolithic age, there have pretty much always been the same number of people in Egypt as in the rest of North Africa combined (mostly living from Tunisia westward). So if you really had a number that said 12 million in Egypt, that would imply there'd be roughly another 12 million in the rest of North Africa (for a total of 24 million). Now here's what Mr. McEvedy had: 737 AD: About 4 million in Spain, mostly in the Mediterranean coastal areas (which were all in Muslim Hands). About 3 million in Egypt and another 3 in the rest of North Africa. About 22 million in the rest of Europe combined (mostly in France, the Low Countries, and Italy). 1,346 AD: About 9 million in Spain, most in either the northern or southern thirds of the peninsula (all but the small Emirate of Granada was in Christian hands). About 4 million in Egypt and another 5 in the rest of North Africa. About 70 Million in the rest of Europe (mostly in areas from Poland and Serbia westwards). The Black Death broke out this year, so this is the highest the population ever got during the entire Middle Ages. 

You have to balance the difficulty of learning the writing system against the benefits to an individual for them to do so. On the difficulty side, one easy thing to look at is the number of glyphs that have to be memorized. The first writing systems were pictographic and logographic. In essence, nearly every word had its own glyph. To give you an idea of what that entails, the OED estimates that there are about 180,000 words in common use in their dictionary, and perhaps a quarter of a million more they don't cover. Memorizing the meaning of that many glyphs is a huge challenge. Much of East Asia (iow: a large percentage of humanity) still uses a writing system like this today. For these people, literacy is tougher. Alphabets on the other extreme only try to use one glyph per phoneme in the language. That restricts them to their language, but it lessens the number of glyphs to memorize down to a more manageable 20-30. The other side of the equation is benefit. Simply, what does a person gain by being literate to offset the effort it takes? In a world where all written works have to be hand-copied by a human being, books were a luxury available only to the wealthy. If you didn't have a lot of money, or couldn't find employment as a professional scribe for those same wealthy people, there would be no real use for being able to read (and your access to written materials to practice with would be limited as well). What changed the equation was the printing press. This dropped the price of copying enough that the common man could have access to written materials. The first practical working one started operating in Europe in the mid-1400's. The Renaissance quickly followed.
