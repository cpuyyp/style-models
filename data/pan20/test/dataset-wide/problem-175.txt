Sci-fi scenario with flights to a colony planet. Tech level is otherwise close to today (e.g. no androids or desktop nanofactories). Planet is quite similar to Earth, so e.g. agriculture works, you can grow wheat and raise cattle. What would be the likely/optimal ratio of passengers to cargo transported to said planet? Let's say it costs as much to transport one passenger as five tons of cargo, and available transport resources could per year bring 10,000 colonists and 50,000 tons of cargo - that would be splitting the available resources equally. At one extreme, clearly there would be no point hauling 100,000 tons of cargo and nobody to make use of it. At the other extreme, you don't want to put 20,000 colonists on another planet with nothing more than carry-on luggage; even though it's a nice habitable planet, they will still need tools and supplies. Does the above even split of one colonist per five tons of cargo make sense, or can we reasonably say each person would need more cargo, or less? The closest analogy I can think of is the colonization of the Americas. (The main difference being that in the sci-fi scenario, there are no natives.) What was the overall ratio of people to cargo transported from Europe to America during that time period? 

I think you can do this in a helio-centric system; as long as everything orbits the 'earth' (Moons) and the 'earth' orbits the sun. In other words as long as there are no planets (well visible ones at least) When you observe planets, in out solar system, due to parallax effects they will seem to reverse their direction as they orbit. This is what led Kepler to work out that the solar system is a elliptical helio centric system. So if there are no visible planets, either too small, or are too far away, to observe; then you would have a pretty convincing geocentric appearing system. The only caveat is, you would not have any (slow moving) planets to hang myths and legends or have astrologers able to assign cause to (blame on) "Mercury/Mars/Venus is in Retrograde" 

I'm working on a science fiction story which includes the following premise: Tony Stark invents an unobtainium reactionless engine, and the protagonists want to build a spaceship around it, big enough to carry a nontrivial amount of cargo. They have a company similar to SpaceX, enough money, political authority to bypass red tape and a mandate to waste anything but time. The current idea is to basically take the design of the C5 Galaxy, cut the wings a lot shorter and replace the landing gear with helicopter style skis (the unobtainium engine is VTOL-capable), make a few other tweaks and that should be pretty much it. (Planned flight times are only a day or two, so no worries about extended life support.) How long would it take to build the first model? 

Strength of the magnetic containment (solved problem from developing fusion generators) The stability of the RF cooling/acceleration system Bremsstrahlung radiation (X-rays from accelerating electrons (around a loop)) 

Radiation Because of the flat shape the magnetosphere is only effective at deflecting solar radiation near the middle of the disk. This means that radiation near the edge is lethal, and causes lots of mutations (mutant beasts?) and sickness in the borderlands. So people avoid the boarder lands and never survive returning from the edge. 

Point 1 & 2 are rather obvious, nuf said. The Bremsstrahlung radiation will cause your magnetic capacitor, to leak/loose energy over time. This is why you would want to have lots of plasma moving slowly (rather than the LHC which has a little moving fast). Further thoughts: Rather than hydrogen gas you could use the helium 'ash' from your fusion generator in the plasma containment rings. You could use small streams of this plasma to meet and power 'impulse' rockets, when you want to move about in real space. You could use bursts of plasma as a short range weapon (the plasma will dissipate rapidly in space/ when not magnetically contained. ( this could be an unconventional/ last ditch tactic; as it would bleed the FTL charge you are building up) You could cascade several containment units, so that the discharge from one is used to accelerate the plasma in the next, which is then used to accelerate the next etc etc. Kind of like double bouncing someone on a trampoline to then double bounce on a larger trampoline. The the loss from Bremsstrahlung radiation would not be a problem as you are not trying to store high speed plasma but cascade quickly for a FTL jump. The pattern of bursts of Bremsstrahlung radiation during a cascade would be a characteristic 'jump signature' of each (class of ?) vessel. Cool buzz words warning: Careful engineering of the plasma containment could let you use the storage system as a synchrotron laser (Yes that is a real thing) or the Bremsstrahlung radiation from one storage ring could be used as part of a klystron (yes that is also a real thing) to power the RF generator of the next stage of the FTL cascade. 

For a science fiction story involving time travel, where the protagonists can go back exactly 33 years from 2013 to 1980, and are looking for a way to make a lot of money quickly: Is there any way today (well, in 2013, close enough) to find a list of winning lottery numbers (in any country) from 1980? I've been checking such lottery records as I can find on Google, and none of them seem to go back further than the 90s or thereabouts. (Granted, other forms of information are available back that far like lists of winners of the Grand National and the FA Cup, but I'm curious about the situation with lottery numbers.) 

Sci-fi setting where cargo is being shipped to colony worlds. If a spaceship has to land and take off again, that costs a lot of money, so that mode of transport is reserved for people and urgent, high-value cargo; the plan is to get bulk cargo the last lousy few hundred kilometers in drop capsules, which aerobrake, parachute, splash into the ocean and get towed to shore by boat. The maximum speed at which a capsule will hit atmosphere is 5 kilometers per second. (This is very hypersonic, but still slower than standard orbital velocity.) Their size will be on the order of a few meters, and they will be made of ordinary materials like steel and composites. What shape should the capsules be? Aerodynamic considerations suggest they should be round, perhaps ideally the quasi-teardrop shape (lens with short trailing cone) of the early space capsules. On the other hand, that's a terrible shape for efficient packing aboard a freighter. Efficient packing would much prefer rectangular boxes like today's cargo containers. But sharp corners would probably melt when the capsule hits atmosphere. Would it be viable to at least compromise on something like a cylinder shape? 

This doesn't answer you question exactly but may be useful idea. IMHO any from of chemical energy storage is not going to be compact enough to power a FTL drive. However you could store your excess energy as cool plasma in a couple of magnetic bottles (tokamak). Using the energy from your power source create two, balanced, streams of plasma. One highly positively charged (protons from ionized hydrogen gas), the other negatively charged (mostly the electrons from the ionized hydrogen). You feed each stream of plasma into a different magnetic bottle (or alternating bottles). Using RF generators you 'cool' the plasma, so that it has less side to side velocity and just keeps moving around the loop. You could also also add more energy by increasing the velocity of the plasma around the loop. This is very loosely what happens in the large hadron collider. Only the LHC accelerates a small quantity of plasma very very fast. When It comes to igniting your FTL drive you open a magnetic valve and let the two streams of plasma at each other and zoom their excessive attraction for each other powers your drive and 'blip' you are in a new location. The limitation to the amount of energy you can store is: 

A setting where we still have the rest of our technology, but for reasons - alien space bats, basically - there are no longer any stable orbits around Earth with an altitude higher than about 1000 km. Could we build a replacement GPS based on satellites in low orbit? I know the existing system is based on geosynchronous orbit, but is that an absolutely necessary quality of any such system, or would using LEO just make the engineering more expensive? 

In a futuristic setting where people are worried about enemy spacecraft doing things like dropping bombs from orbit, and are building ground-based lasers to shoot back, Given that such weapons have the disadvantage of having to shoot up through atmosphere (putting them on high ground ~2 km helps a bit, but only a bit), What is the optimum wavelength to minimize absorption and scattering by air (and preferably by clouds)? It's definitely going to be some way into the infrared, but what exact wavelength would be best?
