The above are examples of "counter-behaviors". In buddhist sense, the above is not the way we should lead ourselves to. We shouldn't need to find a counter-behavior to eliminate a behavior. Other words, we should not pick up the behavior from the beginning. Example: One does action (behavior) A. Years later, one finds that action (behavior) A is bad, then she finds (learns) action B to counter action A. 

Why do we love someone. Again, very generally speaking, first comes into play is the "sense of perception" (i.e. "She is beautiful", "He is just gorgeous, look at his body", etc). Then, based on that, you conjure up thoughts and feelings that favor and fulfill that "sense of perception" ("No, no, no, he is not bad, I still think he is a good person", "I dunno why, even though she lied to her own mother and has stolen some money in the past, I still think she was just mistaken; deep inside, I think she is a good person. She is just lost and having a bad time in the moment. I think she is nice. Give her a chance"). 

Karma. So, if you are already in a relationship and would like to know if a "divorce" would be frowned upon, the answer is, all has already begun from the "first perception" that led into "loving" and "wanting to be loved" with this person. If the thought "why is loving another so 'bad'?" or "I think loving and being loved is a most beautiful thing!", then please re-visit my answer here someday in the future as you continue your path with Buddhism and I hope to hear from you then. I am not saying / defining here some thing is bad; rather: not to attach oneself or get attached to that something is good enough. Roses grow, fish swims, but we don't need to pluck the roses or catch the fish and put it into a tank. Let them be where they are and you so likewise. 

That's not what this is about; you don't have to force yourself in / into doing anything in Buddhism. Through practice and observance and patience, when one has attained eventually understanding, you would stop eating meat or other' being's flesh. It is meant to be a normal transition, if one finally understand "the way" of Buddhism, which involves time, patience, observance, reading / meditating / reflecting. It comes to you normally and will so eventually, though the practices mentioned above, when one finally understand it. I was told the following saying many years ago, which I still remember to this day: 

Initially, your eagerness would be lessened by not having the feeling that you are being "attended", sometimes your questions are not answered (language barrier), you might feel ignored (again, as in the example regarding restaurants, they are not "good at" pulling off a good Facade (interior design, service in restaurants) but it doesn't mean they hate you (i.e., they can cook good food. Speaks: they welcome you at heart, but fail to give you a "welcoming" that you expect according to your standard and habits of feeling well-received)). So, what is wrong with going to Temples that are more "Westerners-friendly"? 

You need to fulfill your kids' needs (food, toys, clothes, iPad?). And now you need more money. Normally you work and that's it, but suddenly money is important and thus your job and a raise; so, you start office politics and ooze out some co-workers, who you think might endanger your position). Sufferings to all parties including yourself. Debts. 

Love (out of compassion): There is none (minimized). But compassion exists, regardless of the amount of love (and/or hate/dislike) within you. Care: Without love or hate, one suddenly sees a clearer picture. There is no fuel (love or hate) that forces/drives you to care or abuse. And then, you care out of compassion. Care, in my opinion, is often mistaken as a result of love. Your caring of one thing/being, suddenly, becomes unbiased, it stems from compassion that benefits those, whom you need not to love or hate (cause) previously. Without those attributes, your care/tending to those in need suddenly become unbiased and is thus truly beneficial/helpful. Only then can care benefit those in need. As for previous life (debt or gain). We don't know it, and we wouldn't care. Compassion doesn't care. 

Long answer: First start with learning about your self. By: practicing compassion to beings around you. Eventually, one learns that one's presence is just as "important" as all other beings around you. Henceforth brings to the realization that: your compassion to other beings benefits also yourself. You would then be spreading the word, without even having to utter one. 

I have been to only one temple in the West and it wasn't Thai. A very traditional one. They had no website, not spacious, the interior "design" - there's none - just traditional set up, no music, occasionally filled with smoke from burning incense. 

Let say you are normally a very calm person, knowing how to avoid conflicts and ease things. But since you are with a girl now, you need to become / become competitive and more aggressive (i.e. if she complains that a guy at the train station is looking at her, you would need to stare at his guy back, when normally if you were being stared at, you had your own way to avoid conflict and stay calm). 

And so, let say you still decided to do all of the above and is OK for you, then if one day she so happens to do something that doesn't please you back, all of what you have done for her rush at you in thoughts and your anger arises ("You know I love you, how much have I done for you?, I I I, did this; when I was sick, I still went to you and I I I". And she also "I I I".). 

As we could see here, all these skills can take another form that benefits others and other beings. But would one make as much? But as far as cultivating compassion goes, one can "earn" so much that the compassion he invests in other beings and others with his skills would never depreciate - it keeps on and on. It benefits not just himself. And going back to how much "involved" would he be counted as "not involved": If this is some thing to think of, I think he knows the answer already. But it is good he does so, because he shows that his does have compassion and he is just standing in a crossroad. I hope he makes the choice that could turn his marvelous skills into something that benefits beings and others and alleviate their sufferings. 

No. If it were, it would be the same as saying: "I am a Buddhist, you are not, you do the opposite of what I do and "believe in", hence I am good and you are wrong, hence you are devil." In my humble opinion, it is only about being able to going back to null and "see" things around as they are and those who don't (haven't). And those who don't (haven't) are not evils, for they haven't understood and therefore they are still bind to pleasures, attachments, ego and the "I" that drive them to perform what they do. They haven't been able to "unshell" themselves from these "qualities" through compassion and dis-attachment of the aforementioned. Thanks for question. 

I am answering this question without having previously read other answers herein and would like to express without citing textbook references. If I may. Love (cause): 

And: Then just to please her, you try to lavish her with items you don't normally buy. For example, a leather bag, leather shoes, a gorgeous diner, etc etc. Think of these actions, behind these, someone / thing had to suffer / die for you, for your fulfillment of pleasing her. 

You love someone, more or less on the condition that, this person must love you back. If not, what would happen and how many relationships have ended up in tragedy. 

You're not forced not to have meat, but if you decide to devote yourself and stay in a temple, meat isn't what is served daily. Other words, what if you sneaked out and have meat and get caught? At certain temple, they don't punish you by expelling you, but most would, if not expel, warn you. Or you would be "punished" and be isolated / assigned to certain task where you carry out the work and at the same time "reflect". As to why some of the monks still eat meat, smoke, drink alcohol etc: 

Your kids, who you tried so hard to put into Stanford, turn out to be someone who smokes and drinks on the streets with a guitar, living day by day by stealing. Another attachment that causes sufferings here - your "kindness" to your kids are not reciprocated. You disown them, and they in turn off and on shout at you, etc etc. Or: they turn out to be graduates from Stanford. But not visiting you enough afterwards, not saying to you enough "thank you, papa" and your anger arises. All these are "binary" - your love depends on the others', the others' yours. It will be payed out and must be re-payed. All of the above begin with one perception (re-cap: "He is gorgeous", "She is so fine, so pretty"). 

So, the signs / the reactions here is "detrimental" and secondary. It is rather about what being content is and otherwise. Owning less. Acquire less. Require thusly less. The less the attachment. Compassion is different. One doesn't attach to it, but is still doing things that is benefitting the other(s) and beings. 

A sense arises, an attachment forms, the desire thus forms, the intention / purpose (thought) merges. 

So, this is what knowledge between the one we are so used to and the one mentioned in Buddhism: Knowledge means, as we are so conditioned / taught since birth, to "create" and "invent". By - observing nature and beings. 

An answer to this would be just as the following: If you can "wake up in the morning with full energy, eat when you feel hungry, be able to pass the bowels when needed and sleep when the night falls and when you feel tired" - you would have understood. One might say, "What are you talking about? aren't those what we do every day?" Not really. We wake up in the morning thinking of yesterday, when someone said something unpleasant to us, something that should have been finished, how much did you pay for the meal in a restaurant where the waiter was rude (or nice, that you must come back), etc. We eat thinking of work, the co-worker who we need to pay attention to because he might be doing something ulterior, the "for-loop" the fails from time to time, etc etc. We sleep thinking of tomorrow or next week, our holiday plans, what to wear, "how humiliated I was, when that Jack pulled a trick on me trying to impress the girl I try to get a date with", etc etc. So, what is the role belief? As mentioned, one doesn't need to believe in anything. There is no form. It is not the incense you burn or the perfectly cut rose wood that you set up in your home that make you a Buddhist, or how much you argumentatively "win" in a conversation with others about life or how many temples you have visited, etc etc. As time goes by, and when the understanding is obtained, you lose the sense of "self" and thus "you". You mentioned Western and so I would take the freedom on making a comment correspondingly - in western culture, the "I" is huge, the "form" is more important and the "steps" must be followed sequentially (science) and the "things" must be studied and proven by mathematics and seen under the microscope; this is the only barrier I have experienced when one is learning to walk the path towards Buddhism. What I have learnt is: Observing. Learn how to observe yourself and the nature. If one can do something that is truly beneficial to other beings and livelihood that is not based on "self", it would be a good first step attained. 

If one has some friends from Asia or even himself has travelled there in Asia, one would notice that most of them would dine at this restaurant that is totally below par to the "western" standard. One asks why, he would usually reply: "It is the food that is superb here; am not here for service or decoration." One replies: "What about the one over there? It looks nice and comfortable. And clean." He replies: "Restaurants like these know how to hire good interior designers, but good cook? No." And it turns out that they are right about this, speaking from experience traveling there. Food is in fact more traditional and tastier at those run-down restaurants. At least in Asia. And they are certainly not an attraction to Westerners.
