There is not that much load on the light - just add spacers or bend the mount as @super proposed, you'll be fine. 

most shimano derailleurs will do, as long as you keep them "9-speed" and below. See also the biggest table here (the biggest table with the 1.7 derailleur ratio). Make sure your replacement has at least the tooth capacity you have / you plan to use (big chainring + biggest sprocket wheel - smallest chainring - smallest sprocket wheel) Do not replace the shifter with one for a different amount of gears, as that is the part that determines how far the derailleur will travel per gear change. 

AFAIK all today's 105 and up Shimano cranksets are Hollowtech II, so when replacing your old you need to exchange the bottom bracket with bearing cups. You need to figure out what kind of bottom bracket shell you have and whether replacements even exist (only BSA68 and Italian are available). They are much better than old cranksets (easier to install, reduced weight, increased stiffness, much easier to remove). If you're changing crankset I'd definitely recommend switching to Hollowtech II, but I would not bother if you don't have a good reason to switch (wear, need for different transmission). I also recommend replacing chain and cassette when you're replacing chainrings - they are, for some reason, the most expensive parts of the trio, and you don't want to wear them excessively due to a worn chain. 

I did an unsupported century last year on my 30 pound "shop" mountain bike. The first 55 miles were easy but the last 45 or so were pretty horrible. This year, I want to try it again but with more hills. I really don't want to lug my 30 pound mountain bike up the hills, but I don't have the money for a decent road bike. If I follow a reasonable training plan on my 30 pound mountain bike this year, will I be "safe" moving into high-dollar 15 pound rental road bike 24 hours before an unsupported century? WARNING: This question was edited from its original version. It originally used the term "homemade" century to denote an unsupported century. Also, the question originally asked if it would be okay to switch to a road bike the day of the mentioned century. Now, the question asks if it is safe to switch 24 hours before the mentioned century. 

If you ride alone you could try clip-on aerobars. With these you basically get rid of all strain on your hands and better aerodynamics 

What road pedal system can you recommend? They should be durable (pedal and cleats), have no tendency to fail hazardously and work well (a bit of float, support against rotation around the forward axis (unlike SPD), fast and reliable to enter (I can click into RXS faster and more reliable than into SPD, mostly because the pedals are in a predictable angle. I miss the Xpressos more often that not) I'm especially curious about SPD-SL and Look Keo, since I have no experience with them. Backstory: I'm currently riding Time Xpresso 4. The cleats wear far too quickly to be acceptable (5 month / 4 Mm to get uncomfortable, after a bit more I rip the cleats out the pedal on hard acceleration). So instead of replacing the cleats I tend to replace the system. I had Time RXS before and switched over to Xpresso because the RXS were good while they lasted (~30 Mm) but one broke and caused a near-accident as well as a nasty scratch from the exposed axis on my shin. I hoped Time had addressed this in newer pedals, since others report the issue as well. I realize similar question have been asked, but I still could not find one that answers the aspect of durability. 

Is it feasible for an experienced single seat cyclist to serve as captain of a tandem bicycle and effectively "pull" the stoker behind as if the said stoker was riding in a trailer? It's understood the said stoker will be required to maintain some cadence and balance, but it seems possible that a sufficiently skilled single seat cyclist would theoretically be able to compensate for significant stoker errors. Additionally, I know it would help if the captain had tandem experience, but some experienced single seat cyclists may not have time to try out a tandem before pairing with an inexperienced stoker. 

Under what circumstances would it be advisable to ride a century without stopping? If a person had: 100% daylight; no mechanical failures; and, no stop signs or lights to deal with, it would seem possible that she/he could ride 100 or more miles on a bicycle without ever putting a single foot back on the ground. Given the above assumptions, I'm wondering what other conditions make it favorable for a rider to forgo all stops. Apart from the above mentioned perils, it would seem to me that nutrition, hydration, waste disposal and arm fatigue would be the greatest challenges. 

Newtons second Law: F=ma where m is your mass (including everything, bicycle, luggage), a is acceleration. you look for solutions with a=0 here force F consists of: gravity: m* g* cos(α), g is gravitational acceleration, earth average: g=9.81m/s², α is the angle between path and vertical. air drag: ρ/2*c *A * v² where ρ is air density, c drag coefficient, A reference area, v your velocity friction: d*v, where d is your coefficient of friction your input: Fh. If you have a power meter Fh=P/v where P is your power. than you solve for α: α = acos((Fh - ρ/2 * c * A * v²- d * v) / (m*g)) now you're somewhat stuck, because some of the parameters are hard to measure: c *A and d. There are numbers around for that ( c *A= 0.4, d=1Wh/km ) but the air drag part depends on your clothes, how you are actually sitting on the bike etc. Friction coefficient depends not only on your tires and wheel ball bearing but also on the road surface. However as a cyclist you rarely get too choose your slope of descent, and there is always some equilibrium velocity where you neither lose or gain speed, since air drag grows with velocity squared - at high velocity it will dominate. At low velocity, without input of you, either gravity or friction will dominate, since they grow linearly in velocity. Of course that equilibrium velocity may be beyond what you can go through curves or what you're comfortable with, or what cars are going. 

When I'm alone and plodding along the shoulder of a state highway, I like to stand up to catch a wind gust as large vehicles "fly" by me. The amount of "fun" I get from this is exponentially proportional to the size of the passing vehicle. Unfortunately, I have a few concerns regarding my mischievous behavior. Since my average speed is about 15 MPH [1], I'm typically only in the slipstream of the said vehicles for a short period of time. Does standing up for this short period of time actually give me a substantial increase in speed? Also, I often wear highly recognizable clothing and/or gear. There may be a few non-cyclist motorists that recognize me. I'm concerned that my act of standing up right before I'm getting passed could be perceived as "aggressive" behavior. If I continue to stand up to maximize my slipstream from passing motorists, do you think I will encourage some motorists to dislike me more than they already probably do? [1] - My maximum speed is 40 MPH but that's downhill. Also, I can typically get up to 20 MPH on a flat way when there is a strong tailwind. 

This is the best test of chain wear I know of: it's in german, but the graph should speak for itself. His comment: "Chains were used under subjectively similar conditions - with exception of SRAM PC69 which, in nice conditions, lives for 1500-1800km" Personally I think I rode unknown KMC, Shimano (probably HG-53), and afer having stumbled upon said findings, the Record C9. Different chains definitely have different lifetimes (and failure modes: some tend to tear, some lengthen quickly thus unusable). I have very good experience with C9, however, it is harder to mount (no missing link), and apparently it is incompatible with some slightly worn chainrings, but I'm not sure there. I posted a question on that problem here. IIRC, with me, Shimano chains wore fastest, KMC were somewhat better, maybe in the 2000-4000km range. The C9 lives some 10000 km for me. However, you seem to be located in the USA, apparently it's quite expensive there. With cheap no-name chains I'd guess it depends on your luck. A bad quality chain will wear maybe in a couple 100km, and may tear.
