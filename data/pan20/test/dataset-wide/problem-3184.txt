This was developed into the Vought FU that served 1927-29. The UO-1 first flew in 1922, went into service on the USS Richmond in 1923. After a variety of engines and minor modifications, the last were retired in 1933. (The Vought site.) So your temporal window is 1923-1933. (The earliest possible ships were commissioned in 1916 and retired 1946, let alone the later classes.) 

This looks like the printer for a receiver of high-speed code transmissions, probably marking the paper with electrical impulses. But this is only one component of a system, and might be as little as just the paper feeder. 

My sister was a Witness for a while, and one of my good friends in high school was. I got to know her family & of course they hoped to convert me, so I learned a lot about them. Witnesses do not pledge allegiance to the flag in US classrooms. They do not believe in nationalist ties. They don't even serve the armed services in CO jobs like medic: my friend's male relatives were prepared to go to jail if drafted. Naturally, the Nazis could not tolerate a subculture with no national loyalty, a rigid objection to any participation in a war effort, and an especial respect for Jews. 

"In the past" is a little vague. I'll concentrate on the West because I have no acquaintance with this in the New World and little with Asia In 500 BC, when there was no primogeniture in Athens, men controlled their wealth through infanticide. Since everything had to be split between sons & a dowry provided for daughters, families consisted of two sons and one daughter, or less. On the other hand, in England in the 1890's, the tradition of "the heir and a spare" was well-established (To Marry an English Lord by Wallace & MacColl) and a man's idea of "birth control" might consist of keeping a mistress. One stays wealthy by hanging on to resources, not by divvying them up into parcels too small to maintain one's class. For a peasant, lots of children are wealth, because they are free labor for many years. The wealthy/noble seemed to have figured out fairly early that their family would stay wealthy only if they kept it fairly small. After all, once primogeniture was established, younger sons often had no way to maintain themselves. They might serve a lord (like their brother) or go into the Church, but were regarded almost as a nuisance. The first class to start using birth control regularly was the upper classes, because of higher education & sophistication, & having the money to keep buying condoms (in their primitive form, dating back to the 1600's). 

West Virginia had four twin 16"/45 turrets, so the original photo can't be a Colorado Class battleship. We need one with a triple turret, like the prior Tennessee class, with 4 triple 14"/45 turrets, which had only Tennessee &California. The New Mexico Class seems to look the most like it, especially as to the angle of seeing the guns with the shorter fantail (Mississippi, New Mexico & Idaho). But the Pennsylvania Class's triple turrets are also a possibility (this included only Arizona & Pennsylvania). We'll try to ID the plane later, which we're pretty sure is a Vought. EDIT: Yup, Vought UO-1. Here's a plan of it that lets you see how the nose matches up, the length of the wings, &c. The photo shows it in a cradle on land, but in this case it's specifically one off the Tennessee. An image search on Google will keep you busy for an hour. 

No, it's not obvious, especially not in history. You may be mistaking a Western, Roman Catholic, modern behavior for something universal. The Romans were a little strange in their belief that men should shave and wear their hair short(ish). They bequeathed this to the Roman Catholic Church, which then constantly tried to impose it on European culture. This was passed down to the Protestant churches, mostly rather puritanical, who felt that long hair on a man was Vanity when he should be working as hard as possible to be ugly and practical. From there it reaches the Victorians, who additionally were obsessed with making women a different creation, and finding or creating as many differences as possible between the two sexes (women, you see, by nature breathe thoracically, while men breathe abdominally -- a difference only found when women wear corsets and men don't, but touted by medicos of the time as part of the basic anatomy of the sexes). IN NATURE This is about the level of "natural" in men having shorter hair. Nature, in fact, teaches us that a man and his sister will grow hair about the same length, shaft thickness, and mass. That she averages 4" shorter results in her hair seeming just a trifle longer. But women don't somehow magically grow much longer hair. What you need to consider in nature is that humans are totally weird in being near-naked over the rest of the body but having this very long mane on top of the head (and men, on their faces). Elaine Morgan, in The Descent of Woman, points out the theories of other scientists deriving a number of human traits, starting with the diving reflex, to a time when our pre-human ancestors seem to have lived on the beach and considered going marine mammal, as the elephants nearly did, too. This adaptation shows in the streamlining of hair on the body, or its near loss (the adaptation is more advanced in women), while developing the head of hair as tow ropes for infants. Anyone with long hair who has had a little baby clamp on knows how strongly they can grip it, and with a look of pure delight: I think it makes them feel happy and secure. Male pattern baldness is irrelevant to this. Even as a man is thinning on top, or totally chrome-domed, he can grow the rest quite long enough to tow a child by. (Note: it affects about 70% of men and 40% of women by the time they are old.) The average head hair grows 1/2" a month, and lives about 3 years, giving a max length of 18". People with knee-length hair grow it faster and their follicles hang in there longer. Until my later 40s, my hair grew 1" a month, but only lived about 2-2.5 years. As a result, I could grow it sittable, but not longer, but it was all very healthy and bouncy, because none of it had much wear and tear. Ill health will always result in nails and hair growing more slowly and the product being more fragile. In most periods, anyone with hair over their shoulders had it "long." Braids that hung down onto the bosom were notably long hair of the femme fatale in Burnt Njal's Saga. I have met women with knee-length hair, or longer (most men will cut it shorter), but when you see it as a fashion, as in the 12th C, you can bet the braids are fake. Very few people can grow it this long. (This always reminds me of the mid Victorian fashion for piling up so much attached hair that it was larger than the wearer's head.) Hair length, texture, and mass are all hereditary. People ask me how to get a thick head of long hair, and I tell them, "Choose your ancestors carefully." More averages: among Europoids, the thickest number of hairs per area is usually found in brunets, followed by redheads, with blonds having the least. That's relative. East Asians tend to have coarse hair, more spaced, that gets thinner with age, so that if they wear it short you can see a lot of scalp. Older Asian women often get nearly as thin as their brothers, which is very visible if they insist on wearing Western-style short hair. The use of equine mane and tail shampoos has become popular in Japan and China because of their hair texture: most people shampoos are aimed at European hair. Women's hair usually reaches maximum thickness during their first pregnancy. It's shocking how much comes out in the brush after the baby is born. There's another thinning at menopause, from hormonal shifts. Brunette women with really thick manes are often fighting sideburns and light mustaches, I might point out. It's not the most feminine trait. It's almost always men who have the half-inch long thick eyelashes, too. What's often marked as desirable is not what's common to the sex, but what's rare. IN SOCIETIES We'll take this in all cases as "before Westernization." Also, assume women are wearing hair pretty long unless otherwise noted. That long beards and hair were somehow dangerous in battle seems to have influenced no one at all. Some of the most notable warrior cultures wore long hair. In East Asia, both sexes customarily wore long hair in most societies. Male and female Sikhs must wear it uncut, for their religion. In the basins of the Orinoco and Amazon, it is usual for men and women both to wear short hair. On the Great Plains, the Sioux and the Cheyenne, in both sexes wear hair in long braids. Steppe tribes, men of the Scythians, Sauromatians, Sarmatians, Sakas, &c, wore long hair, with or without mustaches or beards. ($URL$ They often bundled it up at the back of the head. Women were differentiated by matrons wearing tall tarbooshes, one sign by which they should have known that the Golden Prince burial was actually a Golden Princess (weapons and all). The ancient Egyptians in both sexes cropped the hair very short, and women wore cloth headdresses or wigs, as men might also. ($URL$ The ancient Minoan men wore their hair very long. ($URL$ You can always spot a Spartan in art by his long locks (I refuse to see 300 as being obvious modern machismo nonsense) and lack of mustache, though wearing a beard. A Spartan bride cut her hair very short the day of her wedding. We aren't certain they didn't keep it short as a mark of matronhood. Xenophon notes that they felt long hair made a handsome man more beautiful and an ugly one more fearsome. ($URL$ Archaic Greek statues show men with very long hair. Other Greeks are usually shown in Classical art as having shortish hair and a beard. Slaves, on the other hand, were required to have their heads shaved regularly, and their beards at the same time. It was unmanning them. Also, you knew anyone shaven was a slave, and not a free man. Slave women usually had shortish hair. Persians and Medes also wore collar-length hair and beards, but are shown with them very carefully curled. ($URL$ This is pretty much the Mesopotamian fashion after the Sumerians. Thing is, the ladies appear to have worn their hair the same. ($URL$ As it happens, I was just reading The Anglo-Saxon Home: A History of the Domestic Institutions and Customs of England from the Fifth to the Eleventh Century by John Thrupp.
