As mentioned in the comments on the page linked above, the backstory of Lung the Quick is explained in more detail in the first Digger book. If you don't have the book, it's also summarised here (OK, that site isn't a reliable source in itself, but it's sourced directly to the book) as follows: 

As long as you can keep it in that cuboid shape, you're all good. What really damages a paperback book is when the covers or pages start opening inside your bag and then getting bent or folded unnaturally against things. If you can keep the book safely closed, it's much harder to damage. So, make sure to pack your bag so that there are no forces tending to push the book open. Ideally, go the other way and make sure there are forces tending to press the book closed. 

So that's the effect on the story, from an out-of-universe point of view. The death of this one innocent girl brings about a massive change in the jurisdiction and history of Panem, a clear resolution to the romantic subplot, and clarifies the bittersweetness for Katniss of the 'victory' in Panem by breaking the plot armour which those closest to her have so far enjoyed. But you were asking about what we can learn from her death, what lessons or morals we can draw from this part of the story. I'm not exactly sure what kind of thing you're looking for, but here's a few obvious conclusions and how they relate to Prim's death. War is hell. I said above that Collins doesn't stint on showing us the gritty reality of war. This comes out in so many ways throughout Mockingjay: the prominence of propaganda in the war effort, the casual killing of civilians, the isolation in ignorance of one team of soldiers from the rest, ... and now this. Nobody is safe, even the innocents. Prim is surely the person we'd have least expected to die in this story. She's not a soldier; she's not (as far as we knew up to this moment) part of the war effort at all. Her main role in the story seemed to be someone Katniss loved unconditionally - a less complex relationship than with Peeta or Gale or her mother - and as a motivation, a reason for Katniss to keep fighting and to want a better Panem (more on this later). Her death seems more horrendous than any of the soldiers, and gives us a face for all the untold innocents suffering in this war. Neither side is as rosy as it makes out. I don't think I need to go into much detail about this, as it's the whole point of the business with Coin. Just as Katniss learns that Coin would be almost as bad a dictator as Snow, so we, the readers, realise that both sides committed atrocities - and Prim's death is the catalyst for that realisation. This is an important lesson in terms of real war too: it's never "good against evil"; that's just what they (your country, or the victors, or whoever) want you to think. In a sense, from a narrative point of view, Prim 'had' to be killed. Somebody close to Katniss needed to die, to remind us that you can't get through war without losing anyone and to show us how difficult it is for her to piece her life back together at the end; and it couldn't be Peeta or Gale, because that would end the love triangle in the wrong way. But there's another reason why it had to be Prim ... It's all about Prim. Prim's death brings the story full circle. It was Prim who started everything off, by being reaped as a tribute forcing Katniss to volunteer. Every step of the way, Katniss has been fighting for Prim: when she volunteered to be part of the Hunger Games, when she promised Prim that she'd try to win and come back home, when she promised Snow to play along with the romance facade after her family was threatened, even when she fought for a better Panem. She doesn't get much page time, but she's always there in Katniss's thoughts, "the only person in the world I'm certain I love". Perhaps we needed reminding of that, and here's our reminder: Prim lying dead and Katniss (who's been having a nervous breakdown almost every other chapter in Mockingjay) finally, totally, broken. It seems fitting to end this by quoting from perhaps the only SE answer that's made me tear up: 

This would also fit with Orwell's generally anti-American attitude. 1984 has no mercy: it rips into the Soviet system of 'communism' but also into the west, the US and Britain. As Mark notes in a comment, the name "Airstrip One" is also a clear reference to the way Britain is sometimes referred to in real life as an unsinkable aircraft carrier for the United States. (This phrase likely dates back further than the publication of 1984; one of Wikipedia's citations is to this Time Magazine article from 1950.) The only other relevant quote I've found is this from Chapter 3: 

So there you go. Four different theories for why Josef K.'s last name was never revealed, each with reasons both for and against believing it. Take your pick. 1 Cited to Franz Kafka, Der Proze√ü (Berlin, 1951). H stands for Hochzeitsvorbereitungen auf dem Lande (New York, 1953) and T for Tagebucher (New York, 1948). 

Is it possible that you're thinking of the wrong religion, and it's actually Channa/Chandak, servant and charioteer to the Buddha? Looking up Chhandak tells me that the name is derived from this Buddhist figure, even though it's mostly found among Hindus. And in that case, could the book you're thinking of be the Dhammapada? It has a lot more than seven chapters, but maybe you only had part of it? 

I've actually never liked this change in language, because it spoils my suspension of disbelief - it reminds the audience that these characters were in ancient Rome and likely to be speaking Latin rather than English, and therefore that all the rest of the dialogue in the play isn't true to life - so I'm curious about what it's supposed to add to the play. Why this brief switch from English to Latin? 

It seems like the first "beacons" in this passage is used to mean the hills themselves, and the second is used to mean the cairns on top of the hills. Now let's look at the original Icelandic version of the story. (I say "original" - of course the original original was in Old Norse, but Icelandic is by far the closest of the modern Scandinavian languages to Old Norse, so this should be close enough. If anyone has the text of the story in Old Norse, let me know what the relevant paragraph says there.) The corresponding sentence is: 

This is Magician by Raymond E. Feist, first book in the Riftwar Saga, a trilogy which started off The Riftwar Cycle, a huge conglomeration of a dozen different trilogies and series set in the same two worlds, Midkemia and Kelewan. This series is possibly unique among the fantasy I've read in that it's set in two entirely separate and imaginary universes - not our own world and another, nor a single imaginary world. It also does a good job of building Midkemia using standard fantasy tropes so that we can quickly accept it and then making Kelewan seem just as weird and alien to us as it does to the Midkemians. 

What does 'Gilead' mean here? I've looked it up on the internet, but apparently the only places known as Gilead are real-life places in the Middle East - perhaps with some religious significance, but not literally Paradise. Why, then, does the narrator ask about "balm in Gilead"? What is the significance of this question put to the raven? 

One strange aspect of this passage is that the description of the thrush's song is actually incorrect. The song thrush (Turdus philomelos), the main species of thrush found in Britain, has a song which is distinctive because of its constant repetition: every set of notes it makes is repeated over and over again, at least 2 or 3 times and often more. Every British birdwatcher knows this. $URL$ So when I first read 1984, the following description of the thrush's song (emphasis mine) was horribly jarring to my suspension of disbelief:
