Most people go the other way. Many new bikes now only come with double chain rings. And compact crank sets give almost the same gear range as triples. But it should be possible. The distance the front derailleur travels is about the same. You may need to adjust your limit screws though. And of course you need to change the front shifter to a 3 speed version. 

Hard to be definitive. But I thought it started with Gary Fisher and others on cruiser bikes with coaster brakes $URL$ the Repack Races. He went on to develop the first mountain bikes. 

Racing is all about speed. 25mm tyres have a larger contact area so there is more rolling resistance than a 23mm. It doesn't make a huge difference but it is significant. You wouldn't be competitive on 25s with everyone else runnings 23s. But for some very tough terrain, such as going over cobblestones, most teams will often run 25s front and back. They also deflate slightly from the maximum pressure to avoid some of the ride harshness. I started on 28mm tyres on a commuter and soon went down to 23mm. Didn't notice any difference in tyre wear or comfort. Bike was less effort to ride. Only downside is is that it is more likely to catch a rut in the road, but you ride with a bit more caution. 

You might want to read this chain survey. See page 44 and onwards. Lately I have been using Dumonde lube on my chain and I have been pretty satisfied. It makes it easy to keep the drive-train clean, but it does require the chain be completely degreased prior to the first application. My experience has been consistent with the review. 

You didn't mention what gauge you used, but there are many kinds. Take a look at that link; it is worth reading, as is this thread. The current smoothness of the shifting isn't usually the deciding factor regarding when to change, but rather the cost of the other components that wear faster when the chain is worn: the cassette, and the front chainwheels. The idea is to replace the chain (relatively cheap in comparison) before it starts to damage the more expensive cassette and front chainwheels. In my experience I get about 2,000-2,500 miles out of a CN-6701, and I'm riding in near-ideal conditions (Southern California weather). I'm pretty careful about keeping my chain clean and properly lubed. I typically replace the cassette about every three chains, and the front chainwheels (Ultegra as well) are still OK. 

It called a track stand. It originates in track racing on a velodrome, where in the opening stages of the individual sprint event you sometimes need to come to an almost complete halt. Tricky and dangerous to do if not well practiced, it can end in a 'sprawl of shame' if your technique is not perfect. 

I use a Garmin Forerunner 235 which has these features. The heart rate monitor is built into the back of the watch, rather than using a chest strap which I think the Polar model does. It can also connect to bike speed/cadence sensors, your smart phone etc. A dedicated bike computer like the Garmin Edge 810 is also useful as it adds a map display and route planning. 

You will see sealed cartridge bearings in many bottom brackets, which use roller bearings. Also common in head sets. Ball bearings were more widley used up to around 10 years ago. But still common in pedals and hubs. 

Sheldon Brown has another article on dropout spacing which you may want to read. The rear dropouts on road bikes are typically 120mm, 126mm, and 130mm. 135mm is usually found on mountain bikes. If you're planning to use MTB wheels on a road frame, you'll have other concerns besides spreading the dropouts. So far as I understand it, the rule of thumb says that going up one "size" when it comes to older steel road frames is OK. In other words, go ahead and use 126mm hubs on a steel frame with 120mm dropouts, but maybe not 130mm hubs. Most steel frames have a little flex, which permit the rear dropouts to be spread a few millimeters in order to accept a newer (wider) hub, but going from 120mm to 130mm may cause problems with the dropouts coming out of alignment. Your mileage may vary. There are other possible solutions. A recent thread on BF mentions off-center rims. 

Cotter less cranks are much easier to maintain and if you can find some that aesthetically suit your bike then that is a better option. However, if you want to use cottered cranks then that's OK - they have been used for over a century, but follow the rules below and pray to the bicycle gods. 1) always get the correct diameter cotter pin. I believe they used to make a variety of angles, but these days you usually need to file the pin to get it to fit snugly. When doing so, make sure the final surface is even and flat. 2) replace the pins in pairs 3) A cotter pin press is the best tool for removing and tightening the pins. 4) If you do not have a press, then study up on the correct techniques for hammering the pin before you start (e.g. never hammer the pin on an unsupported crank, do not tap lightly, and there are more). Poor technique in the beginning of the removal, or when fitting the pin, can literally add hours to removing a pin. 

I put a good number of miles on a set of Ksyrium Equipes, and got weary of paying my LBS to replace broken spokes. Mavic uses a proprietary spoke, meaning my LBS does not keep them in stock, so I ended up buying them and kept a supply of spokes. After three broken spokes-- always rear wheel, always non-drive side-- I had enough. Admittedly, I weigh around 200 lbs (91 kg), so I'm sure that was part of it, but publicly Mavic does not provide any weight limits for their wheels, though privately they apparently do. That said, I did not use the wheels for cyclocross... just regular road riding. You did not mention how much you weigh; without knowing that, and based just on my own experience, I'd encourage you to find a more durable wheel that doesn't require as much maintenance. 

All the advice given by the other responders is sound. I'll tell you about a bike that I got off Craigslist before I really knew anything about bikes. It was an early-80's Trek road bike. Externally, it looked OK. Some paint scrapes, a little rust-- on top of the top tube, around the cable-routing braze-ons, for example-- but it was a nice bike, back in the day. Expensive when first sold, and not quite cheap when I got it. What was wrong with it? The wheels were true, but they had a hop, like a high point (the rims were out-of-round). The bottom bracket turned out to be shot. There was internal rust in one of the seat stays that prevented the Weigles Frame Saver I sprayed in there from passing all the way through. The saddle was cr@p. In order to get the bike ready to ride, I had to get new wheels, a new bottom bracket, new cranks (I stripped the threads on the non-drive-side crank when trying to remove it), new tires, and a new saddle. But I learned from the experience, just like I learned a lot from my first car, which was a really bad car from the mid-1970's. If you're looking for a road bike, you should keep in mind that not only the wheel size has changed (from 27" to 700c), but so has the spacing between the rear dropouts. So unless you really appreciate vintage road bikes, you probably want to stick to something with at least 8 cogs on the rear cassette. That's not to say that all road bikes with fewer cogs are not good. I have a 1983-vintage road bike with a Japanese frame, really nice quality, and 27" wheels which I have put about 1400 miles on. It's a sweet bike. But the freewheel has 7 cogs, and if I ever want to upgrade it to brifters (from downtube friction shifters) it won't be hassle-free. If you're looking for a mountain bike or a hybrid, you should know that vintage freewheels are getting expensive, so I would probably be looking for something with at least 8 cogs on the cassette, as well. You can get some really good buys on 1990's vintage mountain bikes off Craigslist, especially if you're patient. Too, early mountain bikes had bolt-on wheels, which means you need to carry a wrench in case you flat. So if I were buying one, I'd probably look for one with quick-release skewers instead of bolt-on wheels. If you want quick responses to particular bikes listed online, you may want to try posting links here or over at BikeForums in the C&V forum. C&V gets a lot of traffic, and there are some very, very knowledgeable folks there. Were you to post links to, say, half-a-dozen bikes you're looking at on eBay or Craigslist, you'll get some quick feedback regarding what is wise and what is unwise. In this way, you can benefit from some of the experience of more seasoned folks. 

I guess there are no dropper posts with shorter total length available? Seems like there is a need for one, especially with dual suspension bikes that have shorter seat tubes. You could drill out the top lug and thread of the bottle holder. Much easier to access this way then filing from inside. But you would be left with a slightly larger hole in your seat tube. 

You can buy 30 meter rolls of cable housing such as $URL$ . I would opt for Shimano or Transfil, as have seen problems with the much cheaper Clarkes. Brake cable housings have a completely different construction to shifters. The housing is a coiled sheath , compared to the axial strands in shifter housing. And brake housing is larger diameter. So different housing for different purposes. 

Surly is more known for touring and off road bikes, but they do have a cromoly road bike or just hte frame $URL$ There are still plenty of custom frame builders around. Zinn Cycles is in Colarado, so maybe close to you? $URL$ 

I saw a bike with a similar problem last weekend, but as other people have said, it's hard to know the correct answer without pictures and a better description. In his case, the derailleur cage had somehow sprung past the stopper and the spring was fully unwound. The result was that the derailleur did not provide any chain tension. Fixing it required: 

Remove the chain Rotate the cage against the spring and past the stopper, which was hard to get past Put the chain back on. 

Your H Limit Screw is now properly adjusted. You should now check the L Limit Screw and then set the cable tension so you shifter works correctly. 

Put the real derailleur on the outer most (smallest) cog. Using your hand, pull the front derailleur cable away from the frame to move the chain guide as far out as possible. Do not rely on the shifter alone as it may not be adjusted correctly, if necessary use a rag to protect your fingers. Check the derailleur chain guide is approximately parallel to the chain and sits 1-2mm above the height of the large chain ring. If it is not then your derailleur angle and height need adjustment before adjusting the limit screws. Whilst keeping tension in the cable, adjust the H Limit screw so there is at least a 1mm gap between the chain and the guide. Tighten the screw if the gap is larger, and loosen it if the gap is smaller or the guide is touching the chain. Rotate the pedals a full 360° and check this minimum 1mm gap is maintained at every point of the rotation. Many chain rings are not exactly straight, a small deviation is nothing to worry about, but a large deviation means the chain ring or crank may need replacing, or the bottom bracket needs maintenance. 

I'm not sure if I follow you exactly, but I ride road and dirt. More to it, I ride my mountain bike on the road on the way to the dirt. Here's my $0.02. The tires on my mountain bike are inflated to about 32-35 PSI (2.2-2.4 bars), and they have a lot of rolling resistance on asphalt. The sensation of riding on them is entirely different than my road bike tires, which are typically inflated to 105-110 psi (7.2-7.6 bars). The mountain bike tires feel like they are flat, even when I know they are not. I find myself looking down at them, wondering if they are still holding air. In my defense, on the mountain bike, I use tubes filled with a sealant, so it is possible for a puncture-- a thorn, maybe, or a piece of wire from a car tire-- to cause a slow leak. When you pull the thorn or wire out, there is a little puff of air that escapes, but the sealant usually closes the leak almost immediately. But it is not foolproof, and I can't shake the feeling the tires feel flat, even if I just aired them up before riding.
