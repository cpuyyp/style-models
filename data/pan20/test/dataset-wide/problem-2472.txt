Or I think that each of the formal hindrances have corresponding canonical techniques to counter them, for example The Five Mental Hindrances and Their Conquest references suttas which have advice for how to "denourish" each hindrance. 

1 This technological solution, i.e. barring one's personal access/exposure, is also used by other software developers: see 'Our minds can be hijacked': the tech insiders who fear a smartphone dystopia, which also explains in more detail the theory of why it's addictive and takes your attention. 

(but I think it's worth reading that whole page of 'right speech' guidelines for further insight). Or perhaps you could find a less confrontational way to say that, e.g. "I previously read so-and-so say such-and-such" without emphasizing that that contradicts the teacher. In general I hope questions are welcome as long as you act towards the teacher as if they're a teacher who you want to learn from. If they say things that contradict your prior knowledge then I hope it's on-topic to ask a sincere question ("can the teacher resolve this contradiction/doubt of yours?"), maybe less OK to make an accusation veiled as a question (e.g. "I know more about this than you do and you're wrong, don't you agree?"). 

I think it's related to the topic in SD 19.14 -- "Theme: Sense-restraint & wise attention: how to master the senses". A lot (but not all) of that is Abhidhamma material -- its topic is the formula which appears in several suttas: 

See also Stigmatization and discrimination If you use the word, it's likely to be understood as having some pejorative meaning, but what that meaning is isn't clear. If you must say something critical of another person or another group, I think you should at least try to be clear/specific about what crime[s] or other defect you accuse them of, and therefore not say "cult". 

So maybe people do perceive space: both limited space (in ordinary perception) and unlimited space (as an object of meditation). 

How many levels of enlightenment are there? I think it depends on the school, which defines and describes enlightenment. 

People die because they are born. I think that the purpose of Buddhism or the Buddha is not to teach what death is. I think its/his intention is to teach how to be in the face of death, how to respond to the fact/existence of death: 

I've seen at least one "cosmological" sutta (the Aggañña Suttaa) described as being a parody of the Vedas, or as Buddhist mythology (I guess that's a matter of opinion which some other people would not agree with). 

In Maha-parinibbana Sutta, for example, they're referred to as "bhikkhus" and "Venerable". In this translation it's "monks" and "Venerable". Wikipedia says that, 

Even if you do meet a demon I think that metta (and, maybe, faith: faith that the Buddha and Dhamma can help whatever ails them) is the proper course of action. 

See also e.g. here for some "non-meditative practices or measures". Also, "food" is difficult and a separate category: because you can't just cut it out completely. Instead you should eat moderately, measuredly -- see e.g. Sariputto Sutta (SN 35.120) which mentions guarding the sense-doors, and which says, 

The doctor has (in my experience) nothing much to say about health itself. For example I would go for a yearly check-up and once the doctor said (part-jokingly), "You're very healthy. Go away: I don't want to see you again for another two or three years." 

What about the stories mentioned in the scripts that talk about kingdoms and civilizations with humans with a life expectancy of about 60000/200000 years and etc. those civilizations couldn't have existed according to modern belief. You're asking about this kind of thing: First antarakalpa (Buddhist cosmology). I see that the suttas this comes from (e.g. DN 17 and DN 26 and DN 14) aren't translated on Access to Insight. Here is a comment on how the translator/editor selected which suttas to include on Access to Insight: 

I guess there could be other reasons too, e.g. imperfect morality (generosity, brahmaviharas, and the implementation of lay social life with friends and family and teachers and so on described in DN 31). What are the non-social antidotes to loneliness? I try to rationalize attachment by asking, "Was that relationship impermanent and disatisfactory (in which case it doesn't make sense to wish for it), or is it satisfying (in which case it doesn't make sense to mourn it)?" What is the Buddhist view on social media use? Is it inherently fragmenting awareness as I suspect? Does it have no benefits? There's a lot of advice about social media use, but the advice may not be "Buddhist" (or at least not canonical). Yes there are people who advise you should have some "real friends", and not just "Facebook friends". I suppose if you suspect that social media use is harmful for you, then you should limit it (perhaps like you would limit alcohol). I think that a Buddhist retreat, at least, would have a rule that you should put away your social media device. 

This isn't exactly a Buddhist answer, but the phenomenon you describe reminds me of the science I was taught in school; for example:

It's important to know that things cease ("things" including views, causes, and effects). They arise and cease. Cease, and maybe arise again. Things arise because of causes, conditions. If that's a recurrent pattern (see also samsara) then you may want to change that by controlling the causes. One of my friends had PTSD after (among other things) having been attacked, and bleeding in the shower. She subsequently had "flashbacks" (i.e. vivid unwanted memories, reliving the traumatic event), maybe dissociative disorders, and so on. The (non-Buddhist) therapy which she reported as having been most effective (antidote to flashbacks) was "mindfulness": e.g. when in the shower, remain conscious of being presently in the shower, of what you could see and feel now, and so on. I mention that as an illustrative example because "mindfulness" (albeit maybe a different kind of mindfulness) is a feature of Buddhist "therapy" too. I'm just beginning to become aware of some very entrenched personal emotional issues regarding relationships stemming from childhood etc and in order to find a way to heal I need to admit I have a problem and seek help but wouldn't the Buddhist view be - it's just stuff happening, passing and arising and not self? Maybe? I think my view is that if it's pathological, if it causes suffering, then you ought to (it's your responsibility to) do something about it if you can -- and so to seek help perhaps (as well as taking responsibility). I think there's some dichotomy in the doctrine: on the one hand, Buddhism attempts the salvation of sentient beings, on the other hand an enlightened view avoids attachment to the view that there is "a being". admitting to yourself that you are an alcoholic and stand up in AA meetings and say "I'm an alcoholic" I think "I'm an alcoholic", meaning that I can view myself as a habit-forming creature. My view (my summary of my experience) is that if I start to drink alcohol then I'll tend to do the same (drink alcohol) again and then again; ditto if I start to smoke, start to read, start to bicycle, etc. (most any other activity). Being alcoholic isn't "who I am" though: it's not essential, it's a habit I can change or get rid of, grow out of, be and do without, drop, put aside, or (hopefully) "make like a palmyra stump" as the suttas put it. It's maybe part of "what I am" though (if I resumed the activity I expect I might find it habit-forming again): so when the occasion to think about it arises, then I now try to avoid it (and to the extent that that avoidance is now a "skillful virtue" that is maybe no longer a cause for remorse). 

According to this description of the vinaya, on page 74+ the conditions for the offence "intentionally deprive a human being of life" includes the result as a necessary condition: 

... which result in suffering. And that learning to become immune to suffering implies learning (or includes learning) to avoid the tendency to become attached to views like that. Why bother even trying to accomplish or achieve anything if it's all suffering and the goal is to not exist anymore? Yes. Well the Pali suttas say that there are two extremes, eternalism and nihilism, and that Buddhism teaches a middle way between extremes. It might be worth considering the hindrances for example. Maybe Buddhism teaches how to overcome (or at least, teaches that you should overcome) the hindrances: and that as long as you haven't it's worth bothering with Buddhism. A little story which I think is a good summary is the Zen story titled Nothing Exists:
