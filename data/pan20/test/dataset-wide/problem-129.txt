The leaders of the country want to promote certain family or religious values. In this scenario, the decision-makers in government believe that large-scale education (schools) is counter-productive, and education should be happening in the home or in informal, local co-ops (where like-minded parents with similar-age kids cooperate to share the educational duties and benefits). Why would they believe that? A few possible reasons (choose all that apply): 

You said "assume uploaded personalities have been granted the franchise", which I am interpreting as "assume they are both 'persons' and 'citizens' under the constitution", which would be prerequisites for having a vote. The constitution assigns voters to representatives based on residency but does not directly define "residence". Other legislation does, though: your residence is tied to your representatives in Congress, to your tax jurisdiction, to your school district, to the criminal code that applies to you, and many other things. The government doesn't determine this residence by detecting it automatically; your residence is based on your testimony -- on a voter-registration card, on a tax return, on a driver's license, and more. Where you are at any given moment in time doesn't matter; it's all based on your residential address. (Some situations might impose reality checks on this; for example, the IRS might overrule your claimed residence if you don't spend enough time there.) Putting all of this together, I would expect that uploaded personalities (being persons and having the ability to testify in some form) would declare their residence, same as flesh-and-blood persons. They might use the location of the server where they were uploaded (that would be kind of like a birth certificate), or they might choose to move elsewhere -- but until the constitution is amended to consider locations other than physical addresses, uploaded personalities are going to be required to furnish a physical address on which their rights and obligations under the law will be determined. I don't think it's a given that the constitution would be amended to define a "virtual district" or some such, to contain all uploaded personalities. Uploaded personalities should be as varied as physical ones, and people tend to assemble based on their individual interests. We also have no reason to believe that uploaded personalities would be isolationist; presumably they interact with people, have friends and colleagues, have shared political interests, want to optimize their representation as much as people do (woo, gerrymandering), and more. So in the short term I would expect uploaded personalities to be distributed throughout the current districts according to their interests and preferences. 

With that major a plague there'll be a backdrop of societal strife and vying for power, as other answers have noted. At various points in history religious institutions have held the real power even if there is a government. Sometimes it's been done by force and sometimes by patronage, but in this case they have actual proof that they can work wonders in our world, so expect some to seek that kind of control. You've raised an interesting wrinkle, though: any monotheistic faith, sincerely held, works. The other thing that religious history has shown us is that religious power tends to be accompanied by one-true-way-ism: we should rule, conquer, or whatever because we have God on our side. This time they don't. So the Catholic church, the Orthodox church, the Unitarians, Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Orthodox Jews, liberal Jews, and others are all effective. We should, therefore, expect the "competitions" among (and within) religions to continue. No one group will be able to use its vampire-slaying abilities to justify itself as the One True Faith. Some will likely be troubled that those other guys seem to be working miracles when, clearly, God favors us. Expect each religion to explain others away -- the work of the devil, sorcerers, frauds, whatever aligns with the particular religion. Purists will not accept heathen vampire-slayers as legitimate; pragmatists will take any advantage they can get against the vampires, even if it means working with religiously-objectionable partners. In the USA (I don't have worldwide stats) the fastest-growing religious group is the "none"s, currently at about 20%. These are atheists, agnostics, and people who just don't care or never thought much about religion. Those 20% are now vampire-bait, so given the evidence they see around them, expect many of them to re-evaluate. Religious institutions will see surges in seekers, but only the ones who actually develop faith will stay (because the others will find that they're no better off at fighting vampires than they were). Putting all this together: major organized religions like the church will (a) see a large influx of members or prospective members, who will need to be educated in the faith, (b) seek greater political power, and (c) explain away other religions' effectiveness, circling the wagons somewhat. Less-major or not-so-organized religions will also see some influx and won't be well-positioned for either seeking power or discrediting others, so they'll focus on their own communities. 

It's entirely possible that a human and an alien will find a common social interest that two humans, or two aliens, wouldn't. So instead of thinking of this at the species/racial level, try to think about the values of individuals or smaller groups. 

Certainty Ok, yes, some of today's religions claim certainty too -- certainty about what God wants, about what happens to you after you die, and other matters. But none of it can be proven; it's a matter of faith. On the other hand, the dead stream gives us the possibility of evidence. In our world some believe in reincarnation and that they can identify their past lives. You might find a past-life idea that resonates with you and that might bring you some peace. That's nothing compared to meeting your future self, who can provide identifying information. (On that: we should expect that there will be certain categories of information that people now guard carefully, things that only you and future-you would know, so that these checks can be performed.) Meeting your future self provides some reassurance about your future. Your future self can't tell you tomorrow's lottery number or anything like that, and probably can't even tell you when you're going to die, but you know that you have a future, at least a little. Bed-time prayers ("now I lay me down to sleep" etc) will probably change. Back to certainty. Enough people meeting their future forms and learning about the dead stream will validate some religious ideas and challenge others. There will still be differences of interpretation, but I would expect this common, shared body of knowledge to push people toward a common body of baseline beliefs. For one thing, we're pretty sure now that there is an afterlife; you don't just die and get stuck in the ground and that's it. Instead of trying to make the best life for yourself here and that's it, you now have a whole afterlife to contemplate too. And uncertainty So, what does it mean that you've never been visited by your future self? Did something bad happen? Did your future self die horribly and wants to avoid you lest you find out? Did your future self mess up and "overshoot", and he's now back in your grandparents' time? (Presumably not proceeding to be his own grandpa, because we're avoiding paradoxes here.) Or did he become one of those phantoms that people sometimes talk about? There will be people who never knowingly have an encounter with someone coming back through the dead stream, and this will lead some of them to conclude that people don't always come back. So if they don't come back, something else must happen to them, right? So the idea mentioned in the question of ghosts and phantoms will be a real belief, even if it's not actually true. It's part of human nature, I think, to let our imaginations fill in what we can't verify -- both good and bad. Since people, it appears, enter the dead stream with the memories they had in life, the deaths of the very young will be seen as especially tragic. Before one is old enough to think and reason and have a basic body of knowledge, one won't know enough to be able to come out again. When babies die they're gone, or so many will believe, because how would they know enough to "steer" in the dead stream? At the other end, people who die with dementia are probably gone too. It is possible that the latter will lead to a higher suicide rate among the elderly -- better to go now while the brain still works than take your chances, some might say. We should expect some religious views that say this is not only ok but divine will, and others that say that it's terrible and that you're not supposed to "live" forever through the dead stream. Some will wonder what happens if you decide not to come out of the dead stream. Can you go back to the neolithic age? To the formation of the earth? To the big bang? There will be much philosophy about this but no one will be able to find out. Possibly a focus on the "before-life" (so to speak) will replace the focus some have today on the afterlife. So there'll still be plenty of uncertainty, but the key difference is that people will know that you have some control over your future path, and therefore people will see meaning in all contacts -- and non-contacts -- from the future. 

This blog post about binary-star systems points out that, rather having the stars be close together, they could be far apart and a planet might orbit just one of them. It gives the example of the binary system in Alpha Centauri, where the two stars are 23 astronomical units apart. The post ends: 

As noted by others, the supply chain, both commercial and personal, is significantly affected. Stores not near train stops will probably go out of business, and it's not clear how people get deliveries of furniture, appliances, building supplies like concrete, and so on. Property near train stations has just become much more valuable, and those living or owning businesses far from stations without the political or economic pull to get new stations will probably move out. If people have to move anyway, they might as well move out of the city entirely. They can then drive to city limits and hop a train to work (if they work in the city), and meanwhile they have cars available for their other domestic needs. Park-and-rides at train stations at city outskirts will need to be expanded. You said this is due to environmental concerns, so there's no immediate reason to ban bicycles. Expect to see more cyclists, which will put pressure on the transit system to accommodate cycles being brought onto trains. This lets people reach destinations that are farther from the stations than they'd want to walk. Cycle-based jitneys ("light taxis", so to speak) would also arise unless regulated against. People will probably shop for groceries and household goods more frequently and in smaller amounts, because you can no longer easily transport a large cart's worth of canned and dry goods (heavy). I see this happen with friends who live in large cities where cars aren't banned but just aren't as necessary (like NYC). This gives grocery owners more eyeballs on shelves, so to speak. How grocers would take advantage of that is unclear, but assume that advertising and weekly (or daily) specials would take it into account. You've got to do something about emergency services or cities will be unsafe to live in. People will still have medical emergencies, house fires, and crime to contend with. If you allow emergency vehicles, then response times should improve (no traffic). If you don't allow them, then more people will die or get hurt and crime will likely rise. So, that's all about the cities that are already in place when this decree is made. New cities will be designed to take the new laws into account. New cities are the exception, though (how many do you see now?), so we should expect not so much a new city design as gradual evolution of existing cities. People will move, commerce will move, and the train stations will become the backbone. How quickly? Mass changes like this are hard, so I would expect a couple decades before most of the dust settles. 

The zombies themselves are not threatening, but whoa is that disease scary! That will be the governing consideration. I base this on how people react to outbreaks of deadly diseases (and that's how this will be viewed, as a deadly disease) now. Healthy people will place high priority on protecting themselves from carriers. Zombies will be quarantined, by force if necessary, and the people who take care of them will take extra precautions to avoid physical contact. Think about the reactions to the ebola outbreak of 2014-2015, and that involved a much smaller proportion of affected people. Even once it's determined that transmission isn't airborne or by touch but requires actually drawing blood, there will still be stigma. Think about how people with HIV were treated when the disease first became known -- and how some are treated even today. And, again, we're talking about a much smaller population and a means of transmission that is, shall we say, far from "casual encounter". With 15% of the population affected by an incurable, spreadable disease, and especially if those people's minds are gone anyway, I think society's reaction will be to round them up, put them in special facilities "for their own good", and keep them away from everybody else until a cure is found or the plague dies out. They're still human beings -- or, at least, you don't know that they aren't -- so, while some will call for "putting them down" for the good of humanity, western sensibilities will not support that position. But fear of the disease would make it very difficult for those who want to integrate zombies into everyday life. 

Accuracy Let me expand on "reduced accuracy". I base this on my own experience shooting target-weight bows and observing others. Accuracy at any decent range depends on some fairly fine-grained factors. Aim a fraction of an inch high or low, or draw the string back not quite as far as usual (or just a bit farther), and you're probably going to miss your mark. You might still hit a large target somewhere, but it won't be what you were aiming for. It is not uncommon to mark the center-point of the string for this reason, so that you're nocking the arrow at the same position (and thus drawing at the same angle with respect to the bow) each time. The key to good aim is consistency. If you add arrows to the string in a single draw, then by definition those arrows are not positioned to hit your target. Movies usually depict multiple arrows being spaced an inch or so apart on the string, maybe more. And if those arrows have fletching (feathers), you probably can't get them much closer than half a inch on the string. (For any decently-heavy bow, the arrow itself is about a quarter-inch in diameter.) That's a huge difference when shooting at even 30 yards, to say nothing of 50 or 100 yards. Those extra arrows may look pretty, but they aren't hitting your target. I suppose if you're shooting at a large charging army they might hit somebody else, if you're very lucky, but probably not (see "power"). Power Other answers have already addressed the reduced power so I won't repeat them. Your arrows aren't going to pack the punch you need to do damage. They're also not all going to get the same amount of power; the one in the middle will have more force than the others, which will likely fall short. (Thanks to XandarTheZenon for pointing this out in a comment.) Practicality A competent archer can fire an aimed shot about once every five seconds; good ones are even faster. A lot of this speed comes from the ease of the load-draw-release cycle. It's a very smooth motion; you draw an arrow from the quiver by its nock and place it on the string. You don't even need to be looking at it; this is done by feel. (Instead you're looking at your target.) Now, how long is it going to take you to load three arrows onto the bowstring? I don't think you can do them all at once, and if you do them one at a time then the ones already on the string are going to slow you down. I haven't tried the experiment, but I'm going to be bold and say that it will take you longer to load and fire your trio of arrows than it would take to fire them individually. So you can shoot less-accurate under-powered arrows more slowly, or you can shoot them one at a time instead. I know which I'd choose.
