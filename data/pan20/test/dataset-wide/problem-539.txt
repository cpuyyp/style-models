CX have short wheel base. I don't like CX for rear bags for a long ride as not enough heel clearance and I have to ride forward on the pedals. One of my other bikes. 

Community poked this. Take the blunt end and strike it on concrete. Really I have done this to free keys. Don't go for the hammer first but some times a hammer is what you end up with. 

Chain looks too long to me. Shorten the chain. Not gong to guarantee that will fix the problem but it looks like part of the problem to me. Park Chain Sizing Park chain cutting 

I commute on a bike For a while I commuted that far but I lived in north and only in the summer months Not insane. Exercise and you arrive with a clear head. At 265 I that is not the bike I would recommend That is a lightweight bike more for speed I would recommend a more durable reliable bike - yes it is going to be a few pounds heavier That bike does not have mounts for racks You want a nice rack that is going to hold in place Cloths in a pack are hot and even a few pounds on you shoulders is tiring You can get racks and bags big enough for camping Not cheap but I like Ortleib And I go with a front rack to get better weight distribution Wearing the same clothes back never bothered me. A bulky sweat shirt is not a good selection in the first place. You should only be sweating out light weight stuff. If you are wearing a jacket then unzip it. Get some high end gear - the new active wear breathable but water resistant is great You are going to get caught in the rain - carry rain jacket every day When I had to dress up I would just leave 3 slacks, 1 suit, and 5 shirts and a dozen ties at the office and then take them to cleaners at the office. Rotate out every once in a while. For sure leave shoes at the office! You can find two pair of shoes that will go with about everything. Shoes are heavy and bulky. I would go with a steel bike that will take like 28mm or 32mm tires. It is going to be a more comfortable reliable ride. So an extra 3 minutes for rolling resistance - it is better than a 20 minute flat. Even flat I think I would go gears but single speed is an option. That is a good length commute - you are going to have head / tail winds. You are going to get stronger and some days you are just going to feel stronger Lights - light it up. Commute drivers are the worse. Put $200 into lights. Leave a charger at the office. Leave some cheaper spare lights at the office. As for time I would make a dry run (even if you just go 1/2 way and return). If you got your old commute to 25 mph then great. That is a pretty good speed. Not as sexy nor as fast but this is more of a bike I would recommend. $URL$ It is going to be 5 lbs heavier - but dude you are 265. This also a beefier bike than you need and 18 miles is not a long single ride but over a week you are going to spend some time in the saddle This is a designed to handle a load This is my main commuter (also have cheaper single speed but I only commute 6 miles) I have mine set up with two smaller bags up font One is the stuff for that day and the other is the emergency / repair essentials $URL$ 

This is a mountain bike purchase as a SS As you can see the wheel hub is the same. The difference is the conversion has the chain tensioner. This designed SS has an eccentric bb to adjust chain tension. 

Sounds like you have multi-speed cassette, no derailleur, and no chain tensioner. On the 18T you have good chain tension. Even in this set up as the chain stretches you will get slack on the 18T. Moving to the 16T is not full chain link. A horizontal drop out is typically a little longer then one chain link. If you get all the way back and have slack then you take out link and you will be up in the horizontal drop out. I assume chain line would be OK moving one gear as you probably still have a multi-speed chain on it. But you are going to have slack. If you want to ride single-speed then I think you need to go to true single-speed set up with a tensioner. Another option is to put a derailleur on that bike. Single-speed conversion is not that difficult. Nashbar has a single-speed conversion kit with spacers, three cogs, and tensioner with shipping is like $30. I have seen the cogs in sizes 14T, 15T, and 17T and sizes 16T, 18T, and 20T. Yes you can pay more for higher quality but I have one and it works. Most single speed cogs are 3/32 and I have seen 1/8 (White). Your front chainring looks OK so I would not replace it. When you do replace the front chainring then go single-speed. At then you could go 3/32 or 1/8. If 1/8 then need to go 1/8 chain. 1/8 is more metal and longer life. 3/32 or 1/8 there are single speed specific chains - they are cheap just get one when you order you kit. I run 3/32 cogs with 1/8 chain and chainring - I don't think they have to match. You should replace your chain when you replace the chainring. Not a given your bike would even take an eccentric hub and they are more expensive. 

At the risk of getting beat up on carbon will give it a try. CF seems to be a sensitive subject. I don't agree with your assertion CF are engineered to be strong in certain directions and relatively weak in others. They are designed to have different flex in certain directions - not weak. If I had 4 bikes I need to use as step stools I would go with this order (and I really have all but aluminum): 1) steel 2) titanium 3) carbon fiber (CF) 4) aluminum There is a bit of discussion and comments that bearing weight on the top tube is not a stress a bicycle is designed for (and weak). That is a stress a bike must handle. If I take a tube and hold it at both ends and try and bend it that is the same type of stress as if I took the tube and put either ends on rocks and pushed on the middle. The primary force a top tube takes is bending from the ends. If you watch the video you can see top tube bend and when it fails the two pieces are bending displacement. Santa Cruz Bicycles - Test Lab And you can see the CF held up pretty nicely. CF takes criticism as it fails brittlely which is true but it takes a lot to get it to fail. I would not want to ride any bike that would fail with my weight on the top tube as that is a scenario (crash or drop off) I expect and need it to not fail. With that said there is not one CF. A lot of variance in the construction / layout. If you are going to ride a CF then buy a good one. I don't mean to advertise a brand but Niner has 5 year warranty including racing. I have crashed my Niner Air 9 Carbon hard and not even thought twice about the bike. I use it for CX training at a local park and stand on the top tube to stash my jacket in a tree. There is stuff CF is not good at. Don't put a rack on a CF. Don't take a hammer or bat or hard object to CF. Don't take a drill to CF. Don't over or under torque bolts. I am just amazed at the slow acceptance of CF frames. When CF forks first came out there was a lot a questioning. But now CF is the dominant rigid fork. A fork takes a lot of stress from a lot of directions. People think CF is too light to be strong. I get engineers are misunderstood (and certainly under appreciated) but a simple one foot drop landing on the front wheel is going to put more stress on a top tube than your weight. The frame did not even flex in the picture. I would not ride a frame I could not jump on. 

Just a 5mm allen will get you a lot if you have quick release wheels. Just drop seat and spin the bars. Lace the pedals between the spokes of the removed wheels. In a dorm closet you can hang socks on the bar. You just need to get it against the wall. 

If you rode a 30 cm and 50 cm over same curb at increasing faster speeds the 30 cm would bottom out at a lower speed. Since sine is not linear the difference would not be 3/5 but somewhere around that. Mountain bikers moved to larger tires as they roll over rocks and roots with less effort. Less effort equates to less force. Another answer noted more revolutions so more wear. There is also a sharper angle on the contact patch. This puts more stress on the rubber and casing (and more rolling resistance.) 

The style of bars you referring to are drop bars. Hybrid / city / multi-use bikes now come with both styles of handle bars. Not endorsing this bike. It is just an example. MultUseWithDropBars One thing to consider is a used cyclocross and put touring tires on it. It has drop bars and will take larger tires. You can get great deals on used as many racers upgrade every season or two. And this is the end of cyclocross season. Or a used touring bike but you don't get as good of deals on used touring bike as you don't have racers flooding used market. But if you don't know bikes then you can get burnt used. This is a cyclocross set up with 35mm touring tires that I use for training and crashing around the city. 

There is more than just air friction to consider. If you extend the rack back then you would have too much weight aft and it would make the font wheel lite (it may even bring it off the ground). Vertical you don't have base size to secure and now you have weight higher. The bike would be wobbly. You are not going to have a lot of speed. I would go the current orientation for stability. If you have steel rack you could weld in extensions. You should go steel - a Surly steel rack is like $140. I would pull some weight like bag / tent and strap it to the handle bar. Not cheap but a trailer. travoy Or even more money a cargo bike like a Surly Big Dummy. . 

The edit from freiheit did change the question. He removed the word firmware. I am a software developer and did system support for many years. Including highly secure systems. In my world firmware and software are not the same. Software is compiled - firmware is a raw set of instructions to specific hardware. Yes it is possible to password protect firmware but it is not a common practice. Not something you would simply add with a firmware update - there is typically hardware involved. Firmware rarely has a password. Even if firmware does have a password you can typically defeat it by just removing the battery. Putting a password on a firmware is problematic at best. Password is a point of failure. This is device that is designed for reliability and weight. I seriously doubt they have security / authority on the firmware. Unless the product came with a default password that you had the option to reset the firmware does not have a password. You must have physically access to attach the device. Physical security does protect the firmware. It is not something that can be changed without physical access. If gold medals are at stake then I suggest physical security. Really there are so many things on a bike you could sabotage. If they got to the bike and you had a password on the firmware they would find something else to sabotage. If someone wanted to sabotage the device the easiest hack would be to scramble the password. If you are worried about tampering while the bike was out of your control then you should inspect all component including the e-tube. A router is a great example of firmware and physical security. (the answer from ewwite that firmware devices are relatively dumb is naive at best) If you connect directly to the router you can set anything. The assumption is that if you can touch the box you are trusted. Gamers is the closest example to your use case. You can password protect the BIOS (firmware) with a password. In a money tournament the PCs will typically have BIOS passwords. While you are on break you don't want someone to boot to a floppy and trash your system. 

You can add on offset seat post but that is more money. A decent is $60. A saddle has forward and back design points. If you take it way back and sit back then you put a lot of stress on the rails. I had one fail, when out the back, and landed on the tire on my butt - you don't want that. Tilt the seat down will move you forward. If the bike size actually is correct consider your riding position may not be optimal. What your bike is telling you may be the best position. 

Get the rack first or get them together. You need the panniers to attach solid. Not all racks have the same places to attach. I have Surly Ortleib combo but that is like $200. An over the top design like this gives you more storage. And you could lash some stuff and maybe skip the panniers. Those two little tabs on the bottom are nice for lashing. 

Check out cyclocross style bicycle. It does well on the road and light trails. You can put touring tires on it. wiki Cyclo-cross 

This is my beater commuter. At my gym I have to leave a bike out in a lower end neighborhood. I picked this up used for $400. For a single speed I like 32 mm tires. You can do so much with a CX bike. If you get a nice one you will keep it the rest of your life. Avoid an aluminum true race CX bike. A steel bike is heavier but has a longer life than aluminum. Look at the Surly Cross Check. No one races a Cross Check - it is just a ballistic commuter. A bit more money but like the steel Salsa Vaya. 

Your best bet is to operate the tire in the pressure range on the tires. Check the air pressure regularly. Nominally if you are 180 lb or more then high number. And 140 lb or less the low number. In between then in between. Higher pressure maybe a longer life but still stay in the range. If you weigh 140 lb then not worth a higher pressure for a harsher ride to maybe get a few more miles. Race tires naturally have the shortest life. A soft rubber tire will wear faster but have better traction. A hard rubber tire will last longer but also poor traction and a harsh ride. And consider $ / mile. You can buy a $50 tire that is probably not going to last twice as long as a $25 tire. 

30 cadence is too low and will tend to fatigue the legs more. Pick a lower gear. You don't need to be a pro to climb like a pro. And there are other videos on youtube. As for getting better at climbing - climb more (and at a higher cadence). 

You need a 7 speed chain, cassette, and chainring. You can mix manufacturer but most people just pick one. With cassette and chainrings you will have a maximum hi to lo range based on the derailleur. If you stay close to what you have now you should be good. Check the chainring for wear. You may not have worn them all out. If this is a dup sorry. I will delete. 

I see outer 130 BCD chainrings with 52T/39T. Why the the 39T in the label? How does the outer care or know what the inner ring is? What would be different about 52T/42T? Does the 39T care what size the bigger is? I have a 52T/39T that I want to take down to a like a 48T.
