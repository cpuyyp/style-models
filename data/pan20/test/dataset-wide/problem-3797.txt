Does there exist $X/\mathbb{C}$ smooth projective and some $i>1$ such that $\pi_i^\mathrm{\acute{e}t}(X)=0$ but $\pi_i(X^\mathrm{an})\ne 0$? Does there even exist $X/\mathbb{C}$ smooth projective with $\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(X)=0$ but $\pi_1(X^\mathrm{an})\ne 0$? Does there even exist a connected compact Kähler manifold $X$ such that $\pi_1(X)\ne 0$ but $\widehat{\pi_1(X)}=0$ (profinite completion)? 

The following may be well-known (or obviously false), but I can't find a counterexample or a reference. Suppose that $k$ is some perfect field (one can assume algebraically closed, if that makes you happy) and $X/k$ a connected $p$-divisible group. Suppose though that $X=\widehat{G}[p^\infty]$ where $\widehat{G}$ is a $p$-divisible formal group coming from the completion of some $G/k$. What is the connection between $D(X)$ and $H^1_\mathrm{crys}(G/W(k))$? If $G$ happens to be a super-singular abelian scheme, then we have equality (as follows from Mazur-Messing-Oda), and they are also equal then $G=\mathbf{G}_m$, but I don't know whether to expect equality in general. More generally, what are properties on $Y/k$ such that $H^1_\mathrm{crys}(Y/W(k))$ has slopes in $[0,1]$? Moreover, if it does, what can you say about the $X/k$ with $D(X)\cong H^1_\mathrm{crys}(Y/W(k))$—must it 'relate' to $X$ in any reasonable way? Thanks! EDIT: A helpful comment from a wise elder has suggested that one might be able to say that basically $G$ is semi-abelian and try to prove the result by proving it respects extensions. Have not run through the details, but it seems plausible. 

I apologize if this is too basic for MO. I have an embarrassing admission to make: I don't know the actual definition of the discrete/continuous spectrum of a reductive group $G/\mathbb{Q}$ (in the context of automorphic forms if there is some ambiguity I'm unaware of).In particular, I know what the discrete series representations are for various groups $G$ (e.g. $\text{GL}_2$), and I assume that the discrete spectrum is made up of the discrete series (pluse extra! see the comments below), but I don't know how to define them in a general, 'elegant' way. I have the, possibly wildly incorrect, impression that the discrete spectrum of $G$ is the largest semisimple $(\mathfrak{g},K)\times G(\mathbb{A}^\infty)$-subrepresentation of $L^2(G(\mathbb{Q})\backslash G(\mathbb{A}))$ and that the continuous spectrum is the orthogonal complement of this which should be some sort of 'direct integral' over continuous parameters. But, to be honest, in the searching that I've done I haven't seen this explicitly stated. So, with this being said, I have the following three basic questions: 

I was trying to find a proof, or a counterexample to the claim that if $X/\mathbb{C}$ is connected smooth projective, then $X$ is a $K(\pi^{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}},1)$ if and only if $X^\mathrm{an}$ is a $K(\pi,1)$. For me, $X/\mathbb{C}$ should be a $K(\pi^{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}},1)$ if for all LCC $\mathcal{F}$ the natural map $$H^i(\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(X,\overline{x}),\mathcal{F}_{\overline{x}})\to H^i(X_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}},\mathcal{F})$$ is an isomorphism. I believe this is equivalent to $X$ having vanishing higher étale homotopy groups. So, this question naturally led me to the following questions: 

The reason for the small cardinality number is not the structur of the optimization problem but the dimension of the $x_i$'s and their particular values. It is easy to construct a problem that has arbitrary cardinality. Just consider that $x_i = (1/n)e_i$ where $e_i$ is the $i$th identity vector and $\mu = (1/n^2)\mathbf{1}$ is the vector which has its entries all equal to $1/n^2$. Moreover assume that the dimension of the $x_i$'s and $\mu$ is $n$. It is clear that the constraint $\sum_i x_i p_i = \mu$ can only be satisfied with $p_i = 1/n$ (Here, it is assumed that the matrix $\Sigma$ is formed such that $\sum_{i}(x_{i}-\mu)(x_{i}-\mu)^{T}p_{i}\preceq\Sigma$ is satisfied). 

It is hard to say anything about the QR decomposition of $F(x)$ but I think I can help you with the optimization problem. I suppose that the dimension of $z$ is fix and given by $m-n$. It is not difficult to show that $g(x)=||Q_2(x)z||^2_2=||z||^2$: Let us define $\tilde{z} = [0^T,z^T]^T$, where $0$ is the $m$-dimensional zero vector. Then, $||{z}||^2_2 =||\tilde{z}||^2_2 = ||Q(x) \tilde{z}||^2_2 = ||Q_1(x)0||^2_2 +||Q_2(x)z||^2_2 = ||Q_2(x)z||^2_2$. In the second equation I have exploited that $Q(x)$ is orthonormal. Therefore, $g(x)$ does not depend on $x$. 

there is a solution to your problem. First of all, let us consider the problem $$\mathcal{P}:\\ z : = \max_{\mathbf{F}} Re\{\mathbf{b}\mathbf{F}^H \mathbf{C} \mathbf{F} \mathbf{d}\} {\rm ~~s.t.~~~} Tr(\mathbf{F} \mathbf{F}^H) \leq p. $$ Let $\mathbf{F}_\star$ the solution to the above problem. It is clear that if $ z < a Tr(\mathbf{F}_\star \mathbf{F}_\star^H) $, then $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{0}$ is the solution to your problem. Otherwise, $\mathbf{F}_\star$ is the also the solution to your problem and $Tr(\mathbf{F}_\star {\mathbf{F}_\star}^H) = p$. Now have a deeper look at $\mathcal{P}$. As $\mathbf{C}$ is a Hermitian matrix, there exists the eigendecomposition $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{U} \Sigma \mathbf{U}^H $, where $\mathbf{U}$ is an orthonormal matrix and $\Sigma $ is a diagonal matrix with real-valued entries $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N$. For simplification, and without loss of generality we assume that $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{H}$. Then, we can rewrite $\mathcal{P}$ as $$ \mathcal{Q}: \\ \max_{\mathbf{H}} Re\{\mathbf{b}\mathbf{H}^H \Sigma \mathbf{H} \mathbf{d}\} {\rm ~~s.t.~~~} Tr(\mathbf{H} \mathbf{H}^H) = p. $$ here we have exploited the fact that $ \mathbf{U}^H \mathbf{U} = \mathbf{I}$ and $ tr( \mathbf{FF}^H)= tr( \mathbf{U}\mathbf{H} ( \mathbf{U} \mathbf{H})^H) = tr(\mathbf{HH}^H$). As $\Sigma$ is diagonal we can reformulate the cost function as $ Re\{\mathbf{b}\mathbf{H}^H \Sigma \mathbf{H} \mathbf{d}\} = Re\{\sum_{n=1}^N \sigma_i \mathbf{b} \mathbf{h}_n^H \mathbf{h}_n \mathbf{d} \} = \sum_{n=1}^N Re\{\sigma_n \mathbf{h}_n \mathbf{d} \mathbf{b} \mathbf{h}_n^H \}$, where $\mathbf{h}_n$ is the $n$th column of $\mathbf{H}$. Further, we see that $Re\{\sigma_n \mathbf{h}_n \mathbf{d} \mathbf{b} \mathbf{h}_n^H \} = \mathbf{h}_n(\sigma_n\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{d} \mathbf{b} +\mathbf{b} \mathbf{d})) \mathbf{h}_n^H$. Defining the matrix $\mathbf{Q}_n:= \sigma_n\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{d} \mathbf{b} +\mathbf{b}^H \mathbf{d}^H)$, we can finally rewrite $\mathcal{Q}$ as $$ \mathcal{R}: \\ \max_{\{\mathbf{h}_n\}_{n=1}^N} \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{h}_n\mathbf{Q}_n \mathbf{h}_n^H {\rm ~~s.t.~~~} \sum_{n=1}^N \| \mathbf{h}_n\|^2 = p. $$ From the definition it is clear that each $\mathbf{Q}_n$ is a Hermitian matrix of rank two. All of these matrices have the (same) two eigenvectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$ with (different ) eigenvalues $\lambda_{1,n}$ and $\lambda_{2,n}$. It is clear that vector components in $\mathbf{h}_n$ that are orthogonal to $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$ have no influence on the cost function of $\mathcal{R}$ but increase the constraint value. Therefore, we assume without loss of optimality that $\mathbf{h}_n = c_{1,n}\mathbf{q}_1 +c_{2,n} \mathbf{q}_2 $. Then $\mathcal{R} $ boils down to $$ \max_{\{{c}_{1,n},{c}_{2,n}\}_{n=1}^N} \sum_{n=1}^N (\lambda_{1,n}|c_{1,n}|^2+\lambda_{2,n}|c_{2,n}|^2) {\rm ~~s.t.~~~} \sum_{n=1}^N (|c_{1,n}|^2+|c_{2,n}|^2) = p. $$ Solution The solution to the above problem is simple: Let $i_\star,n_\star = \arg \max \lambda_{i,n}$, then $|c_{i_\star,n_\star}|^2= p $ and $|c_{i,n}|^2= 0 $. Consequently, the solution matrix $\mathbf{H}_\star$ has only one non-zero row (the $n_\star$th row) which is given by $(p)^{0.5} \mathbf{q}_{i_\star}$. Consequently, $\mathbf{F}_\star =\mathbf{U} \mathbf{H}_\star $ and $z = p \lambda_{i_\star,n_\star} $. All the best, Ert 

Is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on some symplectic manifold to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of an autonomous Hamiltonian? In the same spirit, is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on $T^*M$ (with the canonical symplectic structure) to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of a Tonelli Hamiltonian (i.e. a Hamiltonian which is fiberwise convex and superlinear)? 

Given a smooth function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb R$ on a manifold, its local homology at a critical point $x$ is the group $$ C_\star(x) := H_\star ( M_{ < c} \cup \{ x \} , M_{ < c} ) ,$$ where $H_\star$ denotes singular homology (with any coefficient group), $c=f(x)$, and $M_{ < c}$ is the space of those points $x\in M$ such that $f(x) < c$. If $x$ is a non-degenerate critical point, then $C_\star(x)$ is completely determined by the Morse index of $f$ at $x$: the group $C_j(x)$ is equal to the coefficient group of the homology for $j=\mathrm{ind} (x)$, and is trivial for other values of $j$. If $x$ is degenerate, the knowledge of $\mathrm{ind}(x)$ and $\mathrm{nul}(x)$ (this latter being the nullity of $f$ at $x$) is not enough to determine $C_\star (x)$. It is easy to build examples of functions on $\mathbb R^2$ having a critical point $x$ with local homology $C_1(x)= G\oplus ...\oplus G$ ($k$ times, where $k>1$ and $G$ is the coefficient group) and $C_j(x)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. For instance, consider the function $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R$ given by $$ f(x,y)=(y-2x^2)(y-x^2)(y+x^2)(y+2x^2). $$ Here, the origin is a critical point whose local homology (say, with $\mathbb Z_2$ coefficients) should be $C_1(0)=\mathbb Z_2\oplus\mathbb Z_2\oplus \mathbb Z_2$ and $C_j(0)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. Does anybody know examples of functions having critical points whose local homology is nonzero in more then one degree? If the answer to the previous question is yes (as I would expect), is it true that given $(n_1,d_1), ..., (n_r,d_r)$ there exists a function $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb R$ with a critical point $x$ whose local homology is given by $C_{d_j}(x)=G^{ \oplus n_j }$ and $C_d(x)=0$ for $d\neq d_1,...,d_r$? 

I wish to add an $\epsilon$ to the previous answer. Assume that your symplectic manifold is $T^*M$, where $M$ is a closed manifold, and consider a so called ``Tonelli Hamiltonian´´ $H:T^*M\rightarrow\mathbb R$, which is simply a function which is fiberwise (differentiably) convex and superlinear. Then consider the value $$ c(H)=\min_{u\in C^\infty(M;\mathbb R)} \max_{q\in M} H(q,du_q). $$ This special number in the literature is called ``Mañé critical value´´. Now, if you fix an energy value $h > C(H)$, you can easily build a new Hamiltonian $G$ such that 1) $H^{-1}(h)=G^{-1}(h')$ for some $h'\in\mathbb R$ 2) $G(q,\lambda p)=\lambda^2 G(q,p)$ for each $\lambda>0$ 3) $G$ is fiberwise convex Now, the Legendre dual of the Hamiltonian $G$ will be a Finsler metric (not Riemannian in general). The interesting thing here is that the critical value $c(H)$ can be defined in many other equivalent ways (in terms of Lagrangian action of closed loops, in terms of minimizing invariant measures, etc.).
