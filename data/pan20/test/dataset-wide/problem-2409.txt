But in reality Buddhism still lives on in India since post-Buddhist Hinduism seems to have copied or integrated concepts from Buddhism, same with post-Buddhist Jainism. It is also possible that Christianity was influenced by Buddhism since Buddhism was popular among the Greeks for some time. 

The Buddha reluctantly allowed women to join only after Ananda begged him to because he knew that allowing women in would cause the dhamma to disappear more quickly, resulting in fewer arahants. 

It's very dangerous to encourage or rationalize hatred. Now I understand that many (if not the majority of people) will be incapable of stopping hatred even if they really want to because of unconscious impulses in them causing aggression. In that case I recommend practicing certain mind-exercises to stop hatred. But I also know that many will not be good at mind-exercises, in that case I recommend massage therapy. Lots of independent unrelated research has shown that massage therapy reduces aggression...it may be one of the most effective methods to reduce aggression and anyone can do it. 

In Pure Land Buddhism there are Buddha-lands that last for an incalculably long time. Amida Buddha seems to be the main one centered, who's light shines everywhere. Primordial Buddha: This Buddha is the Original Buddha, like the unborn itself inside of everything found in Mahayana and Tantric Buddhism. 

How important is vegetarianism by itself to achieving arahantship? Not very. Lots of things you do can indirectly kill living beings besides eating meat (not directly killed by you or your request), better to focus on the things that matter that lead towards arahantship. For reference, here's what it says in MN 45: 

This means those who abstain from eating meat and follow other rules but haven't abandoned these nine things would still be incapable of becoming arahants even though they follow all types of rules and ascetic practices. 

If you want the kamma to be exhausted quickly here and now rather than leading to negative destinations in the future then become well-developed in body, virtue, mind, and discernment, unrestricted, large-hearted, dwelling with the immeasurable just as The Buddha says: 

It seems to me like most mainstream forms of Christianity lead to the Brahma worlds or even perhaps the Pure abodes but not towards arahantship here and now, kind of similar to lay Buddhism. In my opinion it is not good to speak about things unknown. Either Jesus was a higher being (since he had iddhi powers) or he was an arahant or Buddha. Who actually knows who Jesus really was or what level he actually attained? Perhaps if I achieve higher states and limitless concentration I can finally discover the truth. 

The popular portrayal of kamma isn't what The Buddha believed in (if someone does good deeds then good things would happen to them or if they do evil deeds bad things will happen). He thought that there were many different variables involved in one's experiences besides good or bad deeds. There are also certain deeds perceived as good that are actually bad and other deeds perceived as bad that are actually good. As explained in the Maha Kammavibhanga Sutta (MN 136) there are certain people who do evil deeds who still go to heavenly worlds after death and other certain people who do good deeds who still go to hell after death: 

Claiming to be enlightened by itself doesn't mean that it's not true. It's just that even during The Buddha's time when He was alive and teaching there weren't that many arahants in the world (maybe a few thousand or so). Let alone now in modern times, long after the pure dhamma has disappeared. An arahant is rare. The Buddha had mentioned teachers and beings who falsely claimed to be all-knowing and enlightened. It is possible for someone to achieve higher states but not the ending of mental fermentations and mistakenly believe themselves to be enlightened. It is also possible for non-arahants to achieve iddhi powers and many feats. If I were to encounter someone who claims to be an arahant or fully enlightened I would ask them this simple question "How do you distinguish arahantship from achieving higher states without achieving arahantship?". Although I myself can answer the question I wonder how the arahant claimant would respond. But I believe The Buddha was who he claimed to be, not simply a paccekabuddha but a Sammāsambuddha, meaning both fully enlightened independently and a supreme teacher because: 

It comes from the prediction in DN 26 Cakkavatti Sutta, but The Buddha doesn't give an exact specific amount of years when it would happen or say if it would happen to everyone. The prophecy in DN 26 is that the children of the humans that have a lifespan of a hundred will eventually have lifespan of ten-years-old: 

It seems like The Buddha wanted to encourage people to act on the teachings that lead towards arahantship rather than encourage people to focus on superficial things. 

Thus we see that The Buddha claims that he experiences more pleasure than the King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha. There is also the case where The Buddha explained the fruits (or benefits) or a contemplative life in the Samaññaphala Sutta (DN 2). Arahants and The Buddha himself had "wishes" or "wants", they live freely and do whatever they desire, though not in the same way as ordinary people. It is possible to have wishes or desires but no attachment to them. My suggestion to you would be to keep your desires in accordance to the goal and not to be attached to the end result. There are certain cases where forcing someone to give up a desire would create mental agony in an individual and throw them away from achieving arahantship, and also other cases where individuals give up wishes or desires but do not achieve arahantship. So in my opinion it is better for you to keep certain desires while striving towards the final goal (enlightenment, arahantship). You should think: 

This means the majority of people will most likely not go to the Brahma worlds after death (including most Muslims). The majority of rules and virtues in Islam seem mostly inline with achieving arahantship minus the violence and sex allowed so it shouldn't be that difficult to integrate. The Buddha forbids violence for monks under all circumstances whereas Islam allows violence in some circumstances. The Buddha forbids sex for monks whereas Islam allows it under certain circumstances. But the majority of rules in Islam are inline with achieving arahantship likely because they lead towards the Brahma worlds, and most of the things that lead towards the Brahma worlds are also inline with what helps one achieve arahantship. But remember that arahantship directly comes from extinguishing mental fermentations (asavas) not from merely doing good deeds alone (which makes achieving arahantship easier but doesn't directly cause arahantship). 

What happens to a person after death relies on much more than just one thing or one deed, but also earlier kamma, later kamma, and the view at the time of death, which is why sometimes good people go to hell and evil people go to heaven. The effects of kamma however will always be felt in some form either now or in some existence 

Here we see The Buddha explaining the variables involved earlier kamma, later kamma, and the view at the time of death. The person will always feel the effect their deeds in some form, but how that happens relies on many different factors. As explained in the Lonaphala Sutta: 

You could say that only arahants, paccekabuddhas, and sammasambuddhas understand Buddhism. Also even beings that are willing and capable of achieving arahantship still won't, The Buddha uses similes of attempting to make a fire with wet wood: 

Of course it will be harder to achieve arahantship when you have men and women integrated together or living closely side-by-side. Because of human nature whenever men and women are integrated there will always be sex and issues caused by the desire for sex pleasure. Ananda, a non-arahant, hadn't seen these dangers, out of compassion he thought there was no harm. If The Buddha hadn't allowed women in, the dhamma would've lasted longer, obviously. The Buddha also says: 

Walking on water is one of the miracles Jesus is famous for, according to Christian scriptures he also performed many other miracles, but these were just normal things for arahants and disciples. It is important to note that merely having iddhi powers doesn't mean that someone is actually a Buddha or even an arahant, but someone who is an arahant should be able to (if he desired) to gain iddhi powers. It is quite obvious that in this modern world there must be few known arahants, it should be easy for a real arahant to obtain iddhi powers. Many people who believe themselves to be arahants or Buddhas are not. It also important to note that arahants and Buddhas teach differently depending on the environment they arise in, the people they appear to and the method by which they personally achieved enlightenment. According to Christian scriptures Jesus was higher than the angels, according to the Pali canons Buddha was superior to the devas and the Brahmas in the universe. In the earlier Pali canons arahants are equal to Buddhas, but predictions of next Buddhas in the earlier Pali canons do not recur so it is uncertain to me if they are accurate like how other things recur over and over again. In the earlier Pali canons the distinction between an arahant and Buddha is only that the Buddha is the supreme teacher. An arahant can teach and give teachings, but a Buddha is the supreme teacher. There can be many arahants and pacceka Buddhas that arise in the world that are technically equal to the Buddha, but not the same as the Tathagata. The Buddha referred to himself as an arahant and after enlightenment prior to the request from Brahma Sahampati gave teachings to people he encountered even when he hadn't opened the doors to immortality. So it's possible that there were many beings in the past who were arahants or pacceka Buddhas that didn't open the doors to immortality but gave teachings to the people they encountered since The Buddha himself gave teachings prior to opening the door to deathlessness. 

Usually whenever people speak of a Creator that existing in the beginning of the universe they are referring to the same Maha Brahma that The Buddha spoke of. This means Judaism, Christianity, and Islam likely came from the Brahma worlds or beings influenced by the Brahma worlds. The angel Gabriel is likely an attendant of Brahma. Maha Brahma in Buddhism is mostly good but sometimes influenced by the Evil One (Satan, Mara), is extremely powerful and knowledgeable but not all-knowing and all-powerful, but He usually praises The Buddha. Certain virtues and morals that lead towards the extremely long-lasting Brahma worlds are also in-line with what helps one achieve arahantship, but The Buddha goes further and beyond the Brahma worlds towards arahantship here and now. The Brahma worlds last for an extremely long time but eventually disappear towards the end of the universe-system, so arahantship here and now or going to the Pure Abodes is preferred. Of course an arahant in the world is extremely rare, even during The Buddha's time there were few arahants. Going to the Pure Abodes after death is also extremely rare. Going to the Brahma worlds after death is also extremely rare. It's much more common for people to go to hell, the animal womb, the realm of ghosts, or a lower heavenly world after death than the Brahma worlds. Sariputta explains in MN 97 how to get to the Brahma worlds, by encompassing your awareness with good will, compassion, appreciation, and equanimity. Similar teachings and virtues to what Muhammad says: 

Many imagine this type of "bliss" as something like relaxation, or a blissful state, but it isn't so, those are merely other "states". It really is the most extreme form of pleasure and happiness, unimaginable, indescribable. I first experienced the "deep relaxation" state, very peaceful and tranquil, and thought that must be what enlightenment must be like, but then I experienced a higher more blissful state and thought that must be what enlightenment must be like, but then I experienced and even more enjoyable higher state....so eventually I concluded that these higher states and feelings are merely feelings and states, incomparable to the enjoyment that isn't a state or feeling. The highest state I've personally experienced is extremely enjoyable, you feel full of confidence, fearless, doubtless, sorrowless, worry-free, care-free, stress-free, full of extreme joy. The other forms of happiness, fun, and pleasure I've experienced pale in comparison. When entered that state I saw how the other states I experienced were merely temporary transient feelings, it's difficult to explain. Having seen my own errors I know that I haven't achieved perfection or enlightenment yet but maybe eventually I will. When describing destinations, The Buddha uses a clever analogy to explain what enlightenment is like: 

The Buddha was not opposed to working towards goals, he was opposed to things that lead away from arahantship. Arahantship or enlightenment comes from the destruction of the Âsavas, usually translated as cankers, pains, taints, or fermentations, not from merely giving up desires or wishes. In many Suttas The Buddha refers to arahants having "wants" or "wishes", though obviously not the same as ordinary humans having wants. There is the Akankheyya Sutta (MN 6) where The Buddha encouraged monks to fulfill their desires (through proper means): 

Those are the five possibilities for anyone's prior existence. Modern day humans were not necessarily humans on Earth in their previous existence (actually quite unlikely), they could've been in a hellish world, an animal, a spirit, or in a heavenly world in their very last previous existence. This means a growing human population does not contradict rebirth or re-existence (the world population was 3 billion in 1960, now it's more than 7 billion). The Buddha for instance was not thought to have been a human on Earth in his last existence, but existing in the Tusita heaven before taking birth on Earth. He had a great childhood, good-natured parents, and lots of luxuries which few humans even in modern times have. In short all "new" humans in their prior existence before taking birth as a human were either in a hellish world, an animal, a spirit, a human, or in a heavenly world (and very unlikely to have been a human right before this existence). It is just a popular misconception that Buddhism teaches that after death one is only born as a human on Earth again and again. UPDATE: The Buddha seems to explain that the majority of humans and devas (heavenly beings) do not take birth as humans after passing away: 

So in my opinion Theravada Buddhism seems to be encouraging vegetarianism or veganism but not requiring it (remember any doubts about demerit means don't eat the meat). Also one part of virtue for monks is: 

An enlightened person who has achieved arahantship has put an end to mental fermentations, so how would they cry? Fermentations which would cause one to cry, experience grief and sorrow wouldn't be there. This means they could only pretend to cry or have the appearance of crying but not actually experience grief or sorrow. 

Scientists claim that there is no theoretical limit to how long humans can live ($URL$ For me personally what I do is concentrate and hold the feeling that "really in reality I'm fully completely healed of all negative health conditions". What happens is after a few seconds of holding this feeling my nose becomes unstuffed, vision improves, and I feel tingling vibrations coming out of my body. Of course the majority of humans can't hold a feeling or thought uninterrupted for even 5 seconds, let alone, a minute, 10 minutes, or an hour, but The Buddha claimed to be able to for up to seven days (168 hours) (MN 14). If you don't want to lose opportunities then become well-developed in body, virtue, mind, discernment: 

I'm assuming that by "understand Buddhism" you mean achieving arahantship. The Buddha is known as the "teacher of humans and devas" so at least both humans and devas. In many suttas The Buddha gives teachings and instructions to devas. Devas seem to be just like humans basically like extraterrestials, except most are longer-lived, experience more pleasure, are better looking with better brains, better senses, etc...many are possessed of iddhi. It is also likely that others like nagas, asuras, yakkhas, and other beings intelligent enough would be able to understand Buddhism because Maha-samaya Sutta (DN 20) mentions some of them as having iddhi power and visiting and taking refuge in The Buddha. Nagas seem to be humanoid reptile-like beings. But in general most humans (and other beings in the universe) won't be able to understand Buddhism well enough to achieve arahantship and some are actually incapable.
