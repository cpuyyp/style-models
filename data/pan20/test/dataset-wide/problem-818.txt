As you say, expansion is proportional to distance. And in fact, compared to the size of the (observable) Universe, Andromeda and our Milky Way are close together. Indeed, farthest objects are now more than 20 billion Ly from us, whereas Andromeda is only 2.5 million Ly away. That is a 1/10000 factor. The space expansion between them is not enough to set them apart, because of their general motion. On small scale (until galaxy cluster scale), the motion is primarily ruled by gravity. Galaxy cluster are in fact the largest gravitationally bound systems we know. 

From which I would roughly interpolate: 600 days earth self-rotation per year full rotation around the sun 2 billion years ago 

Is it just for the spoiler? My guess is that the 3 suns aligned create a sufficient gravity field for the outermost parts - less well attached - of the planet (atmosphere, people, buildings) to be in the Roche Limit of the system, causing them to be sucked out spiraling inwards. Here is a funny vid I found to illustrate: $URL$ . Hope this helps. 

I'm trying to read Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger the "cast of thousands" OPEN Access ApJ letter 848:L12 (59pp), 2017 October 20 $URL$ and get a feeling for the sequence of events that took place as the gravitational waves and gamma ray burst reached Earth at about 12:41 UTC 2017-Aug-17. There seems to be five instruments involved in the first detection and direction determination; LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston, VIRGO, Fermi-GBM, and INTEGRAL. The first three are gravitational wave detectors and the last two are gamma-ray telescopes in Earth orbit. Figure 2 of the paper (part of which is shown below) provides a densely packed infographic of the early observations. In the top left one can see an inset that spans from twelve seconds before the merger during the gravitational wave (GW) ramp in frequency, to six seconds after, where the majority of the gamma ray burst (GRB) is detected. Somehow the combination of the GW and GRB set in motion a sequence of events that triggered a world-wide observation campaign to look for the event in all the remaining electromagnetic spectrum from radio through visible and UV to X-rays. Neutrino data streams were checked as well. Question: I'd like to ask about the sequence of events, the alerts, and the rapid automatic and manual analysis of the GW and GRB data which triggered the alerts. Which detector or combination first "saw" the event as some kind of flagged event? Did one trigger a rapid analysis of the other? Were these automated alerts triggering software to re-analyze, or SMS text messages to thousands of cell phones triggering everyone to sit down at their work stations? 

No, it is not just a matter of migration. You need to take into account two facts. One is that (as experience shows) Io's own gravity is enough to avoid it breaking by tidal forces. It has been like that through all its history: Io could not have been formed if it started aggregating today, but it was formed at the same time Europa and Ganymede did: they three were growing in parallel. Other is that of the orbital resonances, which makes precisely that orbit with so simple integer number relations with those of Europa and Ganymede a stable one. Io could not have been formed in another place. 

Yes, you can, and it is easy. You only need a Nautical Almaniac. You'll find there both the tables you need for the Equation of Time and the formulas to use. 

Of course not. See Neptune's moons. Triton's orbit has a tilt of 157º from Neptune's rotation plane, which is in itself tilted 30º from Neptune's orbit, just 2º away from the Ecliptic. Or look at $URL$ 

In this answer I have rearranged an equation from somewhere, and now I can not relocate the source. My re-aranged form is: $$M_{Abs} = 5 \left(\log_{10}(1329) -\frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(\text{albedo}) -\log_{10}(D_{km})\right)$$ This is the relationship between the absolute magnitude of an object and its diameter and albedo, assuming it is spherical. Question: What is a good source for any form of this equation to which I can link in my answer? 

You can also read about an investigation for X-ray communication in How will NavCube (actually) be important for the XCOM testing and demonstration? I believe this will be a significantly longer term technology development path. NICER, NASA’s Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, will of course also be used for pure Astronomy research on neutron stars. Will this replace GPS? Not really, No. GPS serves the Earth's surface, and near Earth orbit (NEO) very nicely and efficiently. However, once you get a little farther, to MEO and GEO, it gets much more difficult to receive several simultaneous GPS signals because the satellites concentrate most of their power directly on to the Earth's disk, with only some side-lobes "leaking" past the terminator and into space. See the questions and of course their answers: 

In order to know when a star will be above horizon, you'll need an equation with times, not "celestial latitudes". So you end up adding RA and sidereal time. EDIT In order to find out the position of a star you need to find out how its Hour Angle varies with time. The Hour Angle is how far the star is from the observer's meridian: Diagram of angles $URL$ In this image, it is the angle between the site's celestial meridian (North Celestial P ole-Z enith-S outh horizon) and the star's celestial meridian (P-X-Y). It is the same angle as between where X culminates and X. So it comes than $HA=ST-RA$ and since you may not have a "local sidereal time" clock at hand, you can use Greenwich's Sidereal Time: $HA=GST-Lat-RA$ 

No, the planet orbits do not have their major axis aligned. $URL$ You have Inclination and Longitude of the ascending node defining the plane, and Argument of periapsis defining the ellipse orientation in that plane. 

If there is a massive solar storm, we will experience power outages in long lines (e.g. U.S.A. mainland, Russia), communications disruption on satellite links (and again in long copper lines), and very nice auroras. 

The observation of comet 67P by the Kepler space telescope has been reported in various science news outlets recently. For example, the image below appeared in the recent NASA news article NASA's Kepler Gets the 'Big Picture' of Comet 67P and the same or similar images can be seen elsewhere. The article says: 

Why does the Earth's orbital eccentricity oscillate with a period of about 100,000 years? What would be the simplest set of conditions and/or fewest body system that would lead to this particular type of periodic variation in eccentricity? 

The hypothesis that the object has an extreme aspect ratio comes from both the max/min ratio of the light curve and the shape of the light curve, along with some assumptions of the uniformity of the albedo as you mentioned. If you read the BBC article Bizarre shape of interstellar asteroid and click from that page on the link that says which is published in Nature journal. it will take you to an open access draft of the Nature Letter. In it you can see the shape of the light curve. I've chopped up some sections to show below. The "dip" is quite sharp. Remember magnitudes are a log scale, and so the dip would be even sharper on a linear scale. Since 5 magnitudes are a factor of ~100, a 2.5 magnitude dip is a factor of ~10. This is what you would get when a high-aspect ratio objects so that is viewed end-on. A black spot would darken the curve much more gradually, being viewed for a longer fraction of the cycle. This is not proof of the high-aspect ratio hypothesis, and the authors don't claim this. However, it's the best way to fit the curve with the fewest assumptions, as far as I can tell. 

There is however an exception I've been thinking of. Since glass has an amorphous structure, it can also be regarded as a liquid... And if some advanced form of life or intelligence managed to send some into the interstellar medium, then yes there is. It's also possible that some stellar explosion send away magma of some form with an amorphous structure similar to that of glass (e.g. obsidian) 

Any point in space feels the gravity of the whole observable universe around it. If you are in the middle of nothing, then the gravitational field you measure can be incredibly low. But from small differences of mass and energy density throughout the (constantly moving) universe, it fluctuates, and drag you around in a direction or another, as long as you are mass or energy or spacetime. If you are close to a massive object, on the other hand, then you are strongly bound to it by gravity, you will measure a strong field. Now if you have an equivalently massive object on the opposite of your position, gravity field is high, but the force you feel from is low in this place, because it annihilates (even with different mass bodies, this is what happens at Lagrangian point L1).

Question: What are the objects CO–0.40–0.22 and CO–0.40–0.22* and what is the difference between the two. How did the originally discovered CO–0.40–0.22 get its name? The news of the paper is described in the Science item Long-rumored midsized black hole may be hiding out in the Milky Way. There is a nice writeup in Gizmodo for lay scientists: Astronomers Think They Discovered The Missing Link in Black Hole Evolution The paper is not paywalled and can be read here: $URL$ 

What is a quaternary mirror Why does the E-ELT need one What is it about this mirror that is "very complex"? 

This question is primarily about the mathematics of orbital mechanics. The circular restricted 3 body problem (in 3 dimensions) assumes two massive bodies in circular orbits around their center of mass, and a third with zero mass. It is usually solved in a rotating frame and in reduced units with the separation equal to unity and the period of rotation of the frame of 2π. Five Lagrange points can be found from the pseudo-potential surface in 2 dimensions (as well as some periodic horizontal Lyapunov orbits), and things like halo, Lissajous, vertical Lyapunov and other periodic orbits can be found when solving in 3 dimensions. My question is about a relaxation of some of conditions of the problem, allowing for the third body to have a non-zero mass, at least so that the 2nd and 3rd body have some non-trivial center of mass relationship themselves. I'm asking about orbits that would be periodic (or nearly-so). Mathematical stability is not necessary, small displacements can lead to exponential growth of errors, as long as there is at least one mathematically defined periodic orbit. For visualization purposes, imagine moving Earth's Moon to somewhere in the region associated with the original Sun-Earth L1 point, but that's just to get the conversation going. In this case, one could think of the "Earth" and "Moon" as both being in heliocentric orbits, but so close that they are in a 1:1 resonance. The "Moon" would orbit the Sun with an average velocity of about 1% slower than that of the Earth so that their heliocentric orbit period were the same. Has this kind of configuration been explored mathematically? I don't care if it is 3D or only 2D, nor if all six 2-body interactions are considered explicitly or if there are some simplifications. Basically, anything that considers some effect of the "Moon's" gravity on the "Earth" so that it is no longer treated as massless. There is certainly a body of work on non-unity orbital resonances; 2:1, 3:2 etc. but has 1:1 ever been treated in some way? Question: Considering a 1:1 resonance of two planets around a star in close proximity (e.g. large asteroid or small moon at Sun-Earth L1) - have there been any approximate and/or perturbative mathematical treatments? note: original motivation is this answer. 

It's not easy to understand, because there is no clear analogy of how stars form at our level on earth. Interstellar gas clouds eventually collapse to form stars are very large, very massive, very cold, and very tenuous. The star is at the beginning a little portion of the cloud that is more dense than the rest - it results of local and large scale instabilities (some call it an element of chaos). Little by little, the density at the center of the cloud increase - at the same time, it has to overcome opposite forces arising from more probable friction. If the gas is cool enough compared to the density, at some point you start having more and more matter, which results in more and more gravitational attraction for surrounding gas. 

It is a question of where, but also to better understand, you must know when it happened. Because earls structure was different from today's. From wiki on Universe's chronology, By NASA/WMAP Science Team - Original version: NASA; modified by Ryan Kaldari, Public Domain, Link you will learn that first stars are thought to appear when the Universe is about 3% of its current age, i.e. 400 million years old. This is the time it took for first atoms to cool down sufficiently and gather together in the clouds in question. To see where first star formation happened, we have the possibility to look back in time.
