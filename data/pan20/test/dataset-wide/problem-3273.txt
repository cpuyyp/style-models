I've read in a number of places (e.g. Wikipedia) that Proto-Indo-European had first and second-person personal pronouns, but no third-person pronouns. Instead, a system of anaphoric demonstrative pronouns, ancestors of English third-person he/she/it, were used instead. My question, then, is what methodology can be used to determine whether a set of pronouns are third-person personal pronouns or anaphoric demonstratives? 

Languages that conjugate nominals for singular vs. plural number are quite common across the world. Languages which also have a dual conjugation are also fairly common. But is there any language which has a 0-number conjugation: a grammatical number indicating 0 of the specified nominal? 

General and fairly short answer: Indo-European languages generally have two tenses: past and non-past. The non-past (what you call the present) can be used for the future, though depending on the language other means might be preferable when speaking about the future, e.g. English prefers to use an irrealis mood marked by the modal verb "will" (which, I might add, can also be used for the present and past, e.g. "He'll be there by now" and "He would [past tense form of will] go later"). But you can also use the plain non-past tense in some situations, such as where a future seems tangibly close, e.g. "The sale begins tomorrow". It's also worth noting that while in English tense and aspect are relatively orthogonal (two tenses x three aspects) other Indo-European languages might be more complicated. E.g. Proto-Indo-European had only four tense-aspect combinations: stative (would become the perfect), perfective (aorist), and past and non-past imperfective (imperfect and "present", respectively). In such a case the future would probably use either the perfective or the subjunctive mood, rather than the "present". It's very possible this system (or mutations) exists in some modern Indo-European languages. 

Languages that rely heavily on context, such as Japanese, usually do that because of pressure to be more efficient with utterance time. Japanese has very simple syllable structure and so needs many syllables to state a given thing. To compensate for this it drops redundant information to reduce syllable count (speakers also talk extremely fast in syllables per second). Isolating languages like Chinese face a similar pressure because adding additional information requires adding additional words, which is expensive. But doing this comes at a cost of clarity. As was stated in another thread, redundancy allows robustness and error correction in communication. Situations where a character only hears part of a discourse and grossly misinterprets what is being said are common in Japanese (and similar languages') comedies, and pro-drop is an especially common cause. I have become extremely aware of these kinds of pressures and tradeoffs in the design of my isolating constructed language Caia. 

Does anyone know of any (preferably free) online corpora of indigenous American languages (anywhere on the American hemisphere)? I've managed to find corpora of many of the common world languages, but I'm interested in adding some of the more diverse languages to my library as well. However, just about all of the indigenous American languages have been so marginalized that I can't find any widely-spoken enough to have corpora available. 

What is the current accepted origin of the Japanese particles no/na/ni/ga? One account I heard was that all were descended from a common root: an existential verb nu or ni, where ni was the infinitive/conjunctive form, and no/na/ga are various evolutions of the non-finite/adjectival or irrealis forms. Another account I heard was that ga and no were true particles (ga being a more concrete genitive relation and no being a more abstract genitive relation), while na is a shortened form of naru/nari (which might itself be a contraction of ni aru/ari). I wouldn't be surprised if there were other explanations. Is there an accepted etymology for some or all of these particles? 

I think it was Longacre that suggested the English perfect can not be fully analyzed as an aspect, but must be understood to carry a role in discourse: namely, it marks background information that leads to the present foreground events. In this it plays a role similar to the progressive, where the progressive typically marks concurrent background events and the perfect marks preceding background events. It also contrasts with the simple past in that the simple past is generally foreground events in the past while the perfect is background information for the present. Such an explanation could serve to assign the perfect a monosemous (or bisemous, if you want to separate lexical and pragmatic) meaning. It's possible that the above is responsible for the fact that something recognizable as "the perfect" is very common in world languages, but its semantics vary widely between languages. Perhaps it is a common element for marking background information regardless of specific semantics. But that is just top-of-my-head conjecture. 

A different question made me wonder what is the norm for Indo-European with regard to pro-drop? I know Italic languages generally do it, while Germanic languages generally don't. What about the rest of Indo-European languages? Do we suppose Proto-Indo-European did it? Bonus question: are there any Indo-European languages that have developed a topic-prominent structure? 

What exactly are the Indo-European predicative mine/yours/ours/his/hers/its/theirs forms, in terms of word class and inflection? Would they be considered the genitive (or even the dative) case of personal pronouns, a nominalized (or genitive) form of possessive adjectives, or something distinct? Looking at German, the forms for the genitive, dative, possessive adjective, and predicative possessive are clearly distinct (e.g. genitive 'meiner', possessive adjective 'mein', dative 'meinem', and predicative 'meins'), though the genitive of personal pronouns is rare in modern German. There is some resemblance between the genitive case of possessive adjectives and the predicative forms; I kind of wonder if there might have been a progression of "It is [one] of my things" to "It is mine", but that's kind of tenuous. In English they kind of look like the possessive adjective + -'s, but that's also pretty tenuous. Looking over Beowulf I kind of got the impression that in Old English the dative of possession was used for predicative possession. As I understand it, the genitive of the personal pronoun or dative of possession would have been used predicatively in Latin, and I haven't heard of a dedicated predicative form. 

My question here is what are some languages (I'm not familiar with any) that predominantly use the fourth type: concrete nouns that are used adjectivally by the formation of genitive phrases where the genitive relation conveys equality with the head noun. I suppose German, Japanese, and some other agglutinative languages could be taken as examples of languages which make use of such constructions (if you count agglutination as a genitive structure), but in both cases I'm inclined to think other adjectival strategies are more common. 

In English and (at least a portion of) other Indo-European languages the perfect aspect's foremost role is that of a discourse marker, marking prior events (or events beginning in the past and continuing into the present) serving as background material to the mainline of the discourse. However, many world languages do not have a perfect aspect so to speak. What are other mechanisms used by languages to make the distinction between background material and mainline material that happens to be in the past? I know some languages have dedicated morphemes for marking foreground and background material. Is the stative aspect commonly used for this purpose? I would imagine it's safe to assume that most languages have such a mechanism, given the rather universal need to distinguish foreground and background material in a discourse. 

I'm not sure if this type of thread is allowed, but I've been pondering the possibility that language began as commands rather than expression of arbitrary thoughts. This is based on the observation that in a majority of world languages the imperative form of the verb is a "root" or "defective" form, lacking in inflections or affixes present in non-imperative conjugations. From this, I suppose that commands could have been the proto-form of language due to the fact that primitive commands need at most a single verb and a single noun - the object of the sentence; as its the only one, this argument would need no marking for case, and no morphosyntactic alignment. As the ability to add an actor to the sentence, the means by which this is accomplished gave rise to the different alignments as well as topic-prominent structure. Has this idea been explored before? What evidence is there for and against this idea? 

Hopefully this isn't considered off topic. Are there any audio-video works of art or linguistics that have highly accurate (based on our best reconstructions) depictions of Classical Latin speech in terms of pronunciation and prosody? 

I'm not sure if I should really call this an "answer", but I've conducted thought experiments in the past on rendering English in an ideographic writing system. The strategy I used was to break up words into morphemes, and use one character per morpheme (and a lot of morphemes of the same meaning were collapsed into single characters, e.g. -tion, -ment, etc.; morphemes were often also collapsed into normal words with similar meaning). As English has a lot of agglutinative tendencies (particularly in derivation), this was generally very straightforward. For the sake of efficiency, though, I chose not to represent nonessential morphemes, such as verb agreement conjugates. I also chose to not have any orthographic contrast between contractions and their full forms. In any case, this strategy requires a bunch of simple characters for derivative and inflectional morphemes, as there can be many of them per word; Chinese characters could be used, but would be cumbersome due to the number of strokes. To pull a few random words from this post and how they would be represented (I actually would often use words to represent morphemes, but you get the idea): Really: real -ly Conducted: conduct -ed Morphemes: morph element -s Agglutinative: agglutinate -ive Nonessential: non- essence -al Their: they -'s Inflectional: in- flex -tion -al
