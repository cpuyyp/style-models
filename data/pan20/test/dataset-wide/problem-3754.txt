We shall give a solution in the general lattice theoretic case. In this case, it seems easier to work with ideals rather than filters. More generally, we shall characterize the collection of all $\sigma$-ideals in any $\sigma$-complete join-semilattice with least element $0$. This is a generalization of the duality between join-semilattices with $0$ and algebraic lattices. We shall call an element $x$ in a complete lattice $L$ Lindelof if whenever $\mathcal{C}\subseteq L$ and $x\leq\bigvee\mathcal{C}$, there is a countable $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ with $x\leq\bigvee\mathcal{D}$. The join of countably many Lindelof elements is Lindelof. If $(x_n)_{n\in\mathcal{N}}$ is a sequence of Lindelof elements and $\bigvee_{n}x_{n}\leq\bigvee\mathcal{C}$, then for each $n$, there is a countable $\mathcal{D}_{n}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ with $x_{n}\leq\bigvee\mathcal{D}_{n}$. Therefore, we have $\bigvee_{n}x_{n}\leq\bigvee\bigcup_{n}\mathcal{D}_{n}$. Therefore, the Lindelof elements in a complete lattice forms a $\sigma$-complete join-semilattice with $0$. We shall call a complete lattice $\sigma$-algebraic if every element is the join of Lindelof elements. Theorem: If $A$ is a $\sigma$-complete lattice with $0$, then the lattice of $\sigma$-ideals in $A$ is up to isomorphism the unique $\sigma$-algebraic lattice $L$ where the join-semilattice of Lindelof elements is isomorphic to $A$. Proof: Let $L$ denote the lattice of $\sigma$ ideals in $A$. If $a\in A$, then let $\downarrow a=\{b\in A|b\leq a\}$. Then clearly each $\downarrow a$ is a $\sigma$-ideal. We claim that the elements of the form $\downarrow a$ are precisely the Lindelof elements in $L$. Assume that $I\in L$ is a Lindelof element. Then $I=\bigvee_{a\in I}\downarrow a$, so there is a sequence $(a_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of elements in $I$ such that $I\leq\bigvee_{n}\downarrow a_{n}$. Then we have $I=\bigvee_{n}\downarrow a_{n}=\downarrow(\bigvee_{n}a_{n})$. Now if $a\in A$, and $\mathcal{C}\subseteq L$ is a collection of ideals with $\downarrow a\subseteq\bigvee\mathcal{C}$, then we have $a\in\bigvee\mathcal{C}$ and $\bigvee\mathcal{C}$ is the ideal generated by $\bigcup\mathcal{C}$. One can clearly see that $\bigvee\mathcal{C}$ is the collection of all elements $x$ where $x\leq\bigvee y_{n}$ when $y_{n}\in\bigcup\mathcal{C}$ for all $n$. Therefore $a\leq\bigvee_{n} y_{n}$ where $y_{n}\in\bigcup\mathcal{C}$ for all $n$, so if $y_{n}\in I_{n}$ and $I_{n}\in\mathcal{C}$, then $a\leq\bigvee_{n}y_{n}\in\bigvee_{n}I_{n}$, so $\downarrow a\leq\bigvee_{n}I_{n}$. Therefore the ideal $\downarrow a$ is Lindelof. We therefore have $\{\downarrow a|a\in A\}$ be precisely the collection of Lindelof elements in $L$. Thus, the join-semilattice of Lindelof elements in $L$ is isomorphic to $A$. Furthermore, if $I\in L$, then $I=\bigvee_{a\in I}\downarrow a$. Therefore the lattice $L$ is $\sigma$-algebraic. We now claim that $L$ is the unique such lattice. Assume that $M$ is another $\sigma$-algebraic lattice and assume that $A$ is the join-semilattice of Lindelof elements. Then $A$ is an algebraic lattice. Define a map $f:M\rightarrow L$ by letting $f(m)=\{a\in A|a\leq m\}$, and let $g:L\rightarrow M$ be the mapping where $g(I)=\bigvee^{M}I$. Clearly the mappings $f$ and $g$ are order preserving. Furthermore, if $m\in M$, then $g\circ f(m)=g(\{a\in A|a\leq m\})=\bigvee^{M}\{a\in A|a\leq m\}=m$ since $M$ is $\sigma$-algebraic. Similarly, if $I$ is an ideal, then $f\circ g(I)=f(\bigvee^{M}I)=\{a\in A|a\leq\bigvee^{M}I\}$. Clearly $I\subseteq\{a\in A|a\leq\bigvee^{M}I\}$. Similarly, if $a\in A$ and $a\leq\bigvee^{M}I$, then $a\leq\bigvee^{M}\{a_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ for some sequence $(a_{n})_{n}$ of elements in $I$. Therefore since $I$ is a $\sigma$-ideal, we have $a\in I$ as well. Therefore we have $\{a\in A|a\leq\bigvee^{M}I\}$ as well, so $I=\{a\in A|a\leq\bigvee^{M}I\}=f(g(I))$. Therefore the mappings $f$ and $g$ are inverse order preserving maps. Therefore $f$ and $g$ are isomorphisms between the lattices $L$ and $M$. 

$U$ is a cozero set. There is a sequence $(U_{n})_{n\in\omega}$ of open sets with $U_{0}\ll U_{1}\ll U_{2}\ll\ldots U_{n}\ldots$ and where $U=\bigcup_{n\in\omega}U_{n}$ There exists some sequence $(U_{r})_{r\in[0,1)\cap\mathbb{Q}}$ of open sets with $U_{r}\prec U_{s}$ whenever $r<s$ and where $U=\bigcup_{r\in[0,1)\cap\mathbb{Q}}U_{r}$. 

Under the continuum hypothesis, one only obtains a result about the uniqueness of the ultrapower, but the continuum hypothesis does not imply that there is up-to-isomorphism one ultrafilter on a countable set. The notion of Rudin-Keisler equivalence formalizes the notion of whether two ultrafilters are structurally equivalent. In fact, two ultrafilters are Rudin-Keisler equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic in the category of ultrafilters. It is well known that for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$, there are $2^{2^{\kappa}}$ Rudin-Keisler types of ultrafilters on sets of size $\kappa$. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the ultrapower only follows if you have countably many function, relation, and constant symbols. However, we do not obtain a uniqueness result if you consider uncountably many function symbols, relation symbols, and constant symbols. Let $\mathfrak{C}(\mathbb{N})$ be the structure over the natural numbers where function is a fundamental operation and every relation is a fundamental relation. Then there are $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ function and relation symbols. In this case, there are $2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$ non-isomorphic ultrapowers $\mathfrak{C}(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$. This is because there are $2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}$ distinct Rudin-Keisler types of ultrafilters on a countable set, and if $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are ultrafilters on a countable set, then $\mathfrak{C}(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{U}}$ and $\mathfrak{C}(\mathbb{N})^{\mathcal{V}}$ are isomorphic if and only if the ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are Rudin-Keisler equivalent.

Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we have $\mu^{*}(\bigcup_{n}(A_{n}\cap E))\leq x=^{\lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu^{*}(A_{n}\cap E)\leq \mu^{*}(\bigcup_{n}(A_{n}\cap E))$. Therefore $\mu^{*}(\bigcup_{n}(A_{n}\cap E))=^{\lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu^{*}(A_{n}\cap E)$. 

I have not yet discussed these concerns about the consistency of I3-I0 cardinals with many set theorists. Please upvote if you think my concerns about the algebra of elementary embeddings should produce at least some doubts about the consistency of rank-into-rank cardinals. Please downvote if you do not think my concerns about the algebras of elementary embeddings should produce doubts about the consistency of rank-into-rank cardinals. I have made this post community wiki so that people will feel more free to upvote or downvote this answer based on these new criteria. I personally have some doubts about the consistency of rank-into-rank cardinals since I am concerned about a possible inconsistency arising from the algebras of rank-into-rank embeddings. Define the Fibonacci terms $t_{n}$ for $n\in\omega$ by $t_{1}(x,y)=y,t_{2}(x,y)=x$ and $t_{n+2}(x,y)=t_{n+1}(x,y)*t_{n}(x,y)$. A reduced permutative LD-system [1] is a left-distributive algebra $(X,*)$ together with an element $1\in X$ such that $1*x=x$ for each $x\in X$ and where for each $x,y\in X$ there exists an $n$ with $t_{n}(x,y)=1$. Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ be the set of all elementary embeddings $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$. Then define $j*k=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(k|_{V_{\alpha}})$ for $j,k\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$. If $\gamma<\lambda$ is a limit ordinal, then define $j\equiv^{\gamma}k$ if $j(x)\cap V_{\gamma}=k(x)\cap V_{\gamma}$ for each $x\in V_{\gamma}$ ($\equiv^{\gamma}$ is a congruence on $(\mathcal{E}_{\lambda},*,\circ)$) Intuitively, the reduced permutative LD-systems resemble the algebras of elementary embeddings $(\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma},*,\circ)$ in the following ways: 

e is irrational. Assume to the contrary that e were rational. Then e would be e-rational, a contradiction. 

Let $(\{1,...,2^{n}\},*_{n})$ denote the $n$-th Laver table. Let $$C_{n}=\{(\frac{x}{2^{n}},\frac{x*_{n}y}{2^{n}})|x,y\in\{1,2,3,...,2^{n}\}\}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Then since $C_{n}$ is a finite subset of $[0,1]^{2}$, one can talk about the convergence of $C_{n}$ in the Hausdorff metric (i.e. the convergence in the hyperspace topology or the Vietoris topology). Does $(C_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converge in the Hausdorff metric to $S\cup L$ where $S$ is the Sierpinski triangle in the upper-left half of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ and $L=[0,1]\times\{1\}$? Computer calculations seem to suggest that $C_{n}\rightarrow S\cup L$. 

The intersection of all maximal left ideals. $\bigcap\{\textrm{Ann}(M)|M\,\textrm{is a simple left}\,R-\textrm{module}\}$ $\{x\in R|1-rx\,\textrm{has a left inverse for each}\,r\in R\}$ $\{x\in R|1-rx\,\textrm{has a two-sided inverse for each}\,r\in R\}$ 

Every inner automorphism of a group is an inner endomorphism. If $(X,\wedge,\vee)$ is a distributive lattice and $a\in X$, then the mapping $x\mapsto a\wedge x$ is an inner endomorphism. If $(X,\leq)$ is a Heyting algebra, then the mapping $a\mapsto a*x$ is always an inner endomorphism. The notion of an inner endomorphism is closely related to self-distributivity. If $(X,*)$ is an algebraic structure that satisfies $x*(y*z)=(x*y)*(x*z)$, then the mapping $x\mapsto a*x$ is always an inner endomorphism. If $(X,+)$ is an abelian group, then the mapping $x\mapsto n\cdot x$ is always an inner endomorphism. If $V$ is a vector space, then scalar multiplication is always an inner endomorphism. If $G$ is a group, then the constant mapping $x\mapsto e$ is always an inner endomorphism. There are similar inner endomorphisms on different structures like vector spaces, lattices, and in other structures. Any endomorphism can be made into an inner endomorphism. Suppose that $(X,\mathcal{F})$ is an algebraic structure and $\phi:(X,\mathcal{F})\rightarrow (X,\mathcal{F})$ is an endomorphism. Then the mapping $\phi$ is a (rather trivial) inner endomorphism of the structure $(X,\mathcal{F},\phi)$. 

In braid based cryptography, one typically wants to conceal the way a certain braid $b$ has been obtained. One therefore puts $b$ into some normal form. Since every braid has a unique normal form, the normal form of $b$ only reveals the braid $b$ without revealing any other information about how the braid $b$ was obtained. Therefore, normal forms conceal the method which the braid has been obtained. However, do braid normal forms really conceal information about the braids any better than randomly applying the braid laws? Let $b$ be a positive braid. Let $H$ be the set of all positive braid words which are equivalent to $b$. Now say that two braid words $w,w'$ are $\simeq$-equivalent if $w'$ can be obtained from $w$ by applying only the identities $\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}=\sigma_{j}\sigma_{i}$ for $|i-j|>1$. Let $V=H/\simeq$. Let $E$ be the set of all pairs $\{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\}\in V$ where there exists representatives $x\in\mathbf{x},y\in\mathbf{y}$ such that $y$ can be obtained from $x$ by applying the relation $\sigma_{i}\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_{i}=\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{i+1}$. What is the random walk mixing time for the graph $(V,E)$? Does it take longer for a computer to calculate a normal form for the braid $b$ or to take a nearly random walk on $[b]$ up to the mixing time? 

I am not sure if this is the kind of answer you were looking for, but since no one has given an answer yet, I think it is a good idea to say what little I know about larger cardinal analogues of the Baire category theorem. The only spaces that I can currently think of where one would want to consider larger cardinal generalizations of Baire spaces to larger cardinals are the $P_{\kappa}$-spaces, so I will say a few things about how Baire spaces relate to $P_{\kappa}$-spaces. In order to give motivation for this answer, I will first have to say a few things about $P_{\kappa}$-spaces in general before I talk about the Baire property. $\textbf{Preliminaries concerning $P_{\kappa}$-spaces}$ Many of the basic results from general topology hold when one replaces each instance of "finite" with an instance of "less than $\kappa$" for some regular cardinal $\kappa$. In this context, instead of dealing with ordinary topological spaces where the intersection of finitely many open sets is open, one deals with spaces where the intersection of less than $\kappa$ many open sets is open. If $\lambda$ is a cardinal, then a $P_{\lambda}$-space is a completely regular space where the intersection of less than $\lambda$ many open sets is open. If $\lambda$ is a singular cardinal, then every $P_{\lambda}$ space is automatically a $P_{\lambda^{+}}$-space. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may restrict our attention to $P_{\lambda}$-spaces where $\lambda$ is a regular cardinal. A space $X$ is said to be $\lambda$-compact if the intersection of less than $\lambda$ many open sets is open. If $\lambda$ is a regular cardinal, then the product of finitely many $\lambda$-compact $P_{\lambda}$-spaces is $\lambda$-compact. One can also generalize the notion of a metric space and a uniform space to $P_{\kappa}$-spaces. We therefore define a $P_{\kappa}$-uniform space to be a uniform space where the intersection of less than $\kappa$ many entourages is an entourage. If $\kappa$ is uncountable, then it is easy to show that every $P_{\kappa}$-uniform space is generated by equivalence relations. It is well known that a uniform space is induced by a metric if and only if it is generated by a countable sequence of entourages. The notion of a metric space is analogous to the notion of a uniform space generated by linearly ordered descending sequence of entourages of length $\kappa$. $\textbf{$P_{\kappa}$-spaces and Baire spaces}$ If $\lambda$ is an infinite cardinal, then a $\lambda$-Baire space is a a topological space $X$ such that the intersection of less than $\lambda$ many dense open sets is dense. With this definition, every topological space is an $\aleph_{0}$-Baire space, and an $\aleph_{1}$-Baire space is simple a Baire space. Fortunately, the Baire category theorem does hold for some $P_{\kappa}$-spaces where you might expect there to be some form of the Baire category theorem. Let $\kappa$ be a regular cardinal. Suppose that $I$ is a set and $X_{i}$ is a space for $i\in I$. Let $\prod_{i\in I}^{\kappa}X_{i}$ be the topology with underlying set $\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ generated by the basis consisting of products $\prod_{i\in I}U_{i}$ where each $U_{i}$ is open in $X_{i}$ and where $|\{i\in I|U_{i}\neq X_{i}\}|<\kappa$. If each $X_{i}$ is a $P_{\kappa}$-space, then $\prod_{i\in I}^{\kappa}X_{i}$ is also a $P_{\kappa}$-space. 

Zero step- Since $U$ is a non-empty open set, there is some $I_{0}\subseteq I$ and some $f_{0}\in\prod_{i\in I_{0}}X_{i}$ where if $f\in\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ and $f|_{I_{0}}=f$. Limit ordinal step- If $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal with $\lambda<\kappa$, then let $I_{\lambda}=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}I_{\alpha}$ and let $f_{\lambda}=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}f_{\alpha}$. Successor ordinal step- Suppose that $I_{\alpha},f_{\alpha}$ have been defined already and $|I_{\alpha}|<\kappa$. Then $\{f\in\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}:f|_{I_{\alpha}}=f_{\alpha}\}$ is a non-empty open set, so $U_{\alpha}\cap\{f\in\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}:f|_{I_{\alpha}}=f_{\alpha}\}$ is a non-empty open set. Therefore, there is some set $I_{\alpha+1}$ with $I_{\alpha}\subseteq I_{\alpha+1}$ and some $f_{\alpha+1}\in\prod_{i\in I_{\alpha+1}}X_{i}$ where if $f\in\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ and $f|_{I_{\alpha+1}}=f_{\alpha+1}$, then $f\in U_{\alpha}$. Let $J=\bigcup_{\alpha<\kappa}I_{\alpha}$ and let $f\in\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ be a function with $f|_{J}=\bigcup_{\alpha<\kappa}f_{\alpha}$. Then $f\in U\cap\bigcap_{\alpha<\kappa}U_{\alpha}$. Therefore, since $U\cap\bigcap_{\alpha<\kappa}U_{\alpha}$ is non-empty, the set $\bigcap_{\alpha<\kappa}U_{\alpha}$ is dense. $\mathbf{QED}$ Interestingly, for $P_{\lambda}$-spaces, the property of being a $\lambda$-Baire space is hereditary under taking dense subspaces. 

David White's result may be generalized to necessary and sufficient conditions for when a locally compact space is $\sigma$-compact. A locally compact space is $\sigma$-compact if and only if it is Lindelof. In particular, since every second countable space is Lindelof, every locally compact and second countable space is $\sigma$-compact. Also, the paracompact locally compact spaces are precisely the free unions of $\sigma$-compact locally compact spaces. In particular, every connected locally compact paracompact space is $\sigma$-compact. More generally, a locally compact space is $\sigma$-compact if and only if it is paracompact and cannot be partitioned into uncountably many clopen sets. See the topology book by Dugundji for proofs of these facts. 

In this paper, Laver claims (on page 14 of the Arxiv version) that if there exists a rank-into-rank embedding, then in some upward Easton forcing extension, there are elementary embeddings $j,k:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$ with $j\neq k$ but where $j(\alpha)=k(\alpha)$ for each ordinal $\alpha$. In this model, what do the subalgebras $\langle j,k\rangle/\equiv^{\gamma}$ of $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma}$ look like? I am looking for a characterization of these algebras up-to-isomorphism. The algebra $\langle j,k\rangle/\equiv^{\gamma}$ is always finite by this answer. 

The weak$^{*}$ closure of $\{f\in X^{*}:\|f\|=1\}$ is the unit ball $\{f\in X^{*}:\|f\|\leq 1\}$ for infinite dimensional Banach spaces $X$. To prove this, let $f\in X^{*}$ be a functional with $\|f\|\leq 1$. Let $D$ be the set of all finite dimensional subspaces of $X$. Then $D$ is a directed set under inclusion. Let $f_{d}\in X^{*}$ be a linear functional where $f_{d}=f$ on the subspace $D$ and where $\|f_{d}\|=1$. Take note that for $x\in X$ and $d\in D$ with $x\in d$, we have $f_{e}(x)=f_{d}(x)=f(x)$ whenever $d\subseteq e,e\in D$. Therefore $f_{d}(x)\rightarrow f(x)$. We conclude that $f_{d}\rightarrow f$ in the weak$^{*}$-topology. Therefore, since the set $\{f\in X^{*}:\|f\|\leq 1\}$ is closed in the weak$^{*}$-topology, the set $\{f\in X^{*}:\|f\|\leq 1\}$ is the weak$^{*}$-closure of $\{f\in X^{*}:\|f\|=1\}$. 

I am interested in integration on semirings because measures and integration on a particular commutative semiring have popped up in my research (which up until recently had absolutely nothing to do with any kind of measures and integration). I would be interested in any information on measures and integration on rings even if it is not exactly the notion of integration and measures I had in mind in my research. 

The motivation behind this question is that if there is no such map $\Gamma$, then $B_{\infty}$ cannot be embedded into an algebra $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ of rank-into-rank embeddings since the critical points provide such a mapping $\Gamma$. However, if there is such a mapping $\Gamma$, then it would be reasonable to conjecture that $B_{\infty}$ does embed into some $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$. 

Let $B_{\infty}$ denote the infinite strand braid group. Let $\text{sh}:B_{\infty}\rightarrow B_{\infty}$ be the homomorphism defined by $\text{sh}(\sigma_{i})=\sigma_{i+1}$ whenever $i\geq 1$. Give $B_{\infty}$ the self-distributive operation $*$ defined by $$x*y=x\cdot\text{sh}(y)\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot\text{sh}(x^{-1}).$$ Does there exist a linear ordering $L$ along with a function $\Gamma:B_{\infty}\rightarrow L$ where
