The only kind to avoid is the last, as even if they are genuinely interviewing and not just looking for free work, they have shown themselves to be both cheap and at the very least unprofessional, if not outright dishonest. Uncompensated and unused is just asking you to invest time in showing them that you have the required abilities, no different from asking you to come in for an interview; you will invest time in doing the work, they will invest time (possibly less, possibly more) in evaluating the work you did. Compensated and used are known as evaluation projects, and can be beneficial for both sides. The terms should be appropriate for the work done -- i.e. if the position pays X, then you should at a minimum get X for the project, regardless of whether they use it or not. This gives you a chance to judge the kind of work they will be having you do and how they will interact with you. It gives them a chance to see what you can produce and how you work with them. Do you you ask appropriate questions, do they provide sufficient details? From the employees side, this is all good--typically evaluation projects will only be requested of serious contenders, you get paid for it. So, it's like a long interview, but you get compensated. From the employers side, it can be a bit expensive and it is difficult to come up with an appropriate project--it can't be too long, it can't be too easy or difficult, if you don't do a timed limited project you don't know if they did it in two hours or two days, if you do limit the time you don't know if they missed it by 5 minutes or two days. Typicality companies work around the downsides of this by doing regular interviews (no paid homework) for a contract to hire positions thru a recruiter or temp agency. Uncompensated (or undercompensated) and used -- they are ripping you off. Run away. 

There is no good way to ask your co-workers after leaving the table. At the time, asking them how they wanted to handle it - seperate checks, checks or cash later would have been appropriate. If your supervisor told you to pay, I would suggest sending him a copy of the receipt with a request for instructions on asking reimbursement. Something along the lines of "Here is the reciept for the lunch you told me to pay for, is there a form I need to fill out to request reimbursement? Do you handle this or do I need to send it to someone else?" If you simply took it upon yourself to pay the whole bill, then I would suggest that you simply chalk it up as lessons learned -- everyone, including your supervisor, have quite reasonably concluded that you were feeling generous and treated them all to lunch. Asking any of them to pay after the fact is almost inevitably going to lower their opinion of you -- about the only way around that is if you are from a different culture and can plead justifiable ignorance. Asking after the fact seems like you have changed your mind about treating them -- same as if you had handed out Christmas gifts and then went around asking for the gift back. I suggest that in the future, you either tell the resturant to use seperate checks, or break down everyones portion in advance. 

Well, there seems to be two different aspects to this: whether you tell him at all, and when to respond. First I want to point out that 8 hours isn't all that long of a delay between your resignation and his asking. If he is asking for business reasons, then he may have just gotten around to it after a long day. If he is asking for personal reasons, he may not have wanted to ask during work hours. Since he did not specify that this was a personal request, you are entirely justified concluding that he is asking as your manager, and not responding in any way until you are again at work. If you do not want to answer, and assuming that you don't typically correspond with him via text messages, I would suggest simply ignoring it -- you received it off hours and it has nothing to with your current responsibilities. Let them/him ask more normally, and then say you do not wish to disclose that information. Note that if you would consider a counter offer, you might respond with terms instead of salary -- ie that in order to stay, you want X (amount of money, vacation, flex time, work environment, whatever). 

Whether it is unethical or not depends upon his honesty -- has he lied? If he hasn't lied, then, no. Just as the converse, interviewing people to meet a quota, isn't unethical -- in both cases, a decision has been made, but it is not final, after the interview, either could change their mind. An interview is a crapshoot from both sides, you never really know what the outcome will be. Sometimes you are testing the waters, other times you are desperately swimming for shore, but you never know what will happen next. 

Rudeness is at least partly in the eye of the beholder, so no one can really answer that. What we can answer is: what are the likely/predictable consequences of declining the position? The most likely consequence is that you're unlikely to be offered another position by the same manager. That's not a guarantee, and it is independent of whether or not the manager feels you've been rude. To a slightly lesser extent you're unlikely to be offered a position at the same company. But that's not the question you should be asking. The question you should be asking, is do you feel you'll be better off taking the job or declining it? Keeping in mind that better off doesn't mean making more money. This isn't a question we can answer. You might just be having cold feet, you might be recognizing a significant problem. 

Everyday you are employed you will go home with unfinished work. If the job is totally done, then you by definition no longer have a job to do. So, the question is always when is the best point to get up and go home. But that is between your coworker and your boss, not you. When should you get involved, and ask your coworker to stay? When there is a specific task that only your co-worker can do, and this task can be done in a set amount of time that it is not unreasonable to expect them to stay over to do and you or your team are blocked until the task is completed. And even then, you ask if they can stay, you don't tell them they can't leave. When should you complain about fit or lack of commitment? Most likely never, but if you feel you must, first identify a pattern of behavior, not a single instance. Overtime, with or without pay, is just that -- time over the normal time. As it is pushing into their time more than normal, there will be more conflicts, where overtime will just have to take a back seat to other priorities. Even when a project is behind schedule, a single instance should be unexceptional. On a more practical note: your co-worker finished this the next day, but you say that others had to work over a weekend to get the project done on time. Given both statements, it is unlikely that your coworker staying and working longer would have had a significant positive impact on the schedule, even if they were a bottleneck. Given that fatigue breeds errors, I find it impossible to believe both (a) that it could have taken very long to get it done the next day and (b) that it could have been done in a reasonable amount of time the night before. For anytime it took to do the next day, you can reasonably have expected it to have taken twice that the night before. An hour or two the next day is not going to cause someone else to work over the weekend, and if it took all day, there's a good chance that staying later would have just resulted in bad work that needed to be redone, further putting the project behind schedule. 

Why would you deny them the chance to make the best offer they can? If they can't make it interesting, that's on them. But how is it helpful to deny them the chance to know the market better? If they have asked reasonable questions, give them truthful answers. The only thing I would be careful of, is that you should give them details that would at least make you consider their offer. To give an example, suppose A has a workout room with a pool, and you love swimming laps during lunch. Tell them what you'd want in order to consider their offer, not just what A is offering. They obviously aren't going to add a building and pool just for you, so they can't literally match the offer from A, what would you want to forego your laps? 

It is not OK to use a concealed recorder at an interview. There are legal and moral issues, which others have somewhat addressed, but there is also the issue of what it does to your interview and job prospects if discovered. And what it does is end them - not because you want a record of what happened, but because it is a lie by omission. You are deliberately withholding information from a prospective employer. There is also no reason to do so -- simply state that you will be recording the interview for later review. If they object, you probably don't want to work there anyway. 

The employer should ask what number to call and be open to the reverse if for some reason the candidate does not have or want to give their number. While most likely not a big deal, by asking them to call you are asking them to foot the bill for a possibly extensive long distance. Whenever reasonable, expenses should be borne by the company -- for three (interrelated) reasons. The company can better afford it, not doing so makes you appear cheap, and if you can't afford reasonable expenses in order to hire someone how are you going to pay them? This doesn't mean that you should book a week long vacation package in Las Vegas for the interview, or even pay travel expenses for an in person interview -- but do keep it in mind when making arrangements. For instance some companies like to have a casual meeting -- not a formal interview, but a get to know you meeting, over lunch. The company should be paying for that, not the current employees and certainly not the candidate.
