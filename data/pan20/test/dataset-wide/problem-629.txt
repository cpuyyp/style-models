I'm in the middle of a frame swap for my road bike. As I'm putting the bike back together, I've been wondering what all needs lubrication? Is there a comprehensive list somewhere that explains what parts need it? My list so far: 

Now I can understand why someone would choose a cassette based off of how many teeth the big gear has. Some people live in hilly or mountainous areas and desire a higher number of teeth. Some people live in flat areas where they simply won't use those cassettes with a lot of teeth on the big gear. But why would anyone ever choose to buy a cassette with 12 teeth on the small gear instead of 11? 11 teeth = higher maximum speed. I doubt many people buying a nice set of components (Shimano, SRAM etc) would ever say "I don't need to go faster so 12 teeth is fine with me." What's the point of 12 teeth when you could opt for 11 instead? 

I am currently riding Conti GP4000S tyres, in 700x23mm version, inflated at 115 psi. The grip is great, the (light)weight is amazing. I have punctured twice with them (in 1500 km) which is more that I would hope, but I can live with that. Still, when I look at my tyres, I see minor cuts on the tread. Nothing major but let's just say that any time I am stopped at traffic lights, and I look down, I can see at least a "wound". Do I run the risk of increasing the number of punctures? are those tires really too road-training-oriented to use them for commuting? I like Continental, I like the 23mm format, I like this (lack of) weight. So I was considering 4Seasons which are a few grams heavier but offer an extra layer of protection against puncture. I have plans for a long ride (~150 km) and would want to avoid more than 1 puncture in the day. 

I have Shimano Tiagra 9 Speed shifters on my road bike. On my front deraileur, when I shift up (smaller chain ring to larger chain ring), I can control the amount my derailleur moves, therefore I can use this to trim the front derailleur going this direction to remove chain rub. However, how do I trim going the opposite direction? On my shifter, when I shift down (larger ring to smaller ring), when I press the shifter, it instantly goes down to the next ring. There is no in-between and I can't control the amount it moves. Are you supposed to be able to trim going that direction somehow? Sometimes, if I happen to find myself in my larger cassette gears but also my largest chain ring and I'm not able to adequately shift to a different chain ring (maybe going up a sudden steep hill or something), then I get chain rub. But the only way it seems to be to trim the front derailleur in this case is to shift to the lower chain ring, then shift back up to the larger chain ring but don't push the derailleur all the way into place. 

Of course, when in trouble, when you have no spare tube, and you have a flat, patch it no matter what. That is a no-brainer. A properly patched area might be stronger than the intact area since it fixes the hole, but apart from the hole, it adds some thickness to the tube so puncture resistance. You will (almost) never puncture a patched area: the patch might fail, but you will not puncture the patch. That downside of the patch is that it does not expand (or just very little) compared to the intact tube (try to inflate a patched tube outside of the tire, you will see the diameter is smaller in patched areas). So an overly patched tube will be less expandable in the tire than an intact one. This causes the whole physics of the tube inside a tire to be less perfect than it is conceived for; which is why you must not over-patch a tube (and solves the apparent contradiction). 

Is it possible to buy bulk amounts of shifting/brake cable for road bikes? It would be nice to just have a spool of wire that you run onto your frame and then cut off only as much as you need. A Google search for "bike cable spool" doesn't really result in much, surprisingly... How do bike shops deal with this? Surely they don't buy individual packs of cable for every bike do they? I know you can buy cable housing in bulk, so I was surprised when I couldn't find similar for just the cable... 

Someone recently told me that if I replace my cassette I need to replace my chain (and vice versa) so that they wear evenly. Is this true? And, can anyone elaborate on the reasoning for this a bit more? Why is it important for them to wear evenly? Why does this not apply to the front chainring? Or does it? 

Yes I know it is mid-August and Winter is not here yet, far from it. I am just thinking way forward on how I will be able to do my daily 18 km commute in the Winter weather of Paris (yes, it's not a very harsh winter, but there will be some negative temperatures some ice etc,...). I ride on a trekking bike tranformed into a touring one (Trek FX 7.2) with skinny tires (23 mm) which I love for their reactivity when starting and their speed thanks to their low weight (I know skinny tires are debatable but that what I do and love it). What should I do to ride all winter long? I'm pretty sure I will need spiked tires for ice and snow, however little of it there is in here, but still,.. And since they do those only in fat version (which completely makes sense, obv.) I will need a new set of wheels. I think I will go cheap on that part, a fully built set of 700c wheels for trekking (which will fit my 135mm axle on the rear). Remaining wonderings are following: 

Over the past year, my road bike's crankset has gotten pretty bent up and out of wack. Not due to abuse, just wear and tear I guess. It's pretty bent and has a nice wobble that I can see as I look down at it while pedaling. So I'm interested in replacing the crankset. But I've read there are various rules of thumb to follow when replacing cranksets, chains and cassettes. When you replace one you have to replace the other or something along those lines. Something about teeth wearing evenly. Do I need to replace anything else if I replace my crankset? 

I was looking at purchasing a new cassette and chain. Looking at the available cassettes for SRAM components, there is a big variety of sizes available: 

You could maybe cut it where it is not frayed and put a cap if the slack is long enough. Or you could put a piece of duct tape just to avoid the fraying from reaching a place interfere with the derailleur. Or you could try to gather the frayed-out strings and put a cap anyway Or if you really don't like it, you can change the cable completely though it is overkill. 

I mostly commute and have never had trouble climbing a hill sometimes by using my lowest speeds (or close to them). How do I evaluate even roughly what grave %age I climbed? What I mean is that I would love to tour someday in a real mountain-y region, and would like to know how to approach climbs like this. For example, I see profiles with %ages as high as 10%. I know I never rode 10km at 10% but how does 10% look like? how do I know I won't be forced to give up after the first mile or two? How about 5%? 7%? or the extreme 12.5% I see on some climbs? I do have a GPS device that gives a reliable path of where I've ridden, but the altitude is not reliable to the profiles of my rides are not either.
