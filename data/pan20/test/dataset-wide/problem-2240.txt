The advantage of layering is that it is versatile so for example if you have a base layer an insulating layer and a shell layer you can wear only the base layer in hot weather, base layer plus shell layer in mild but wet weather, base layer plus mid layer in cold dry weather or all of the above in extreme weather. Soft shell jackets and lofted down or synthetics add even more permutations. However, if you know that the conditions will be consistent then more specialist garments may be more appropriate for example in the arctic in winter the temperatures are predictably chilly and you aren't going to get rained on so a full body down and pertex suit may be the most efficient option. Similarly in equatorial jungle insulation is entirely redundant and the humidity may make waterproofing a moot point. There are also a number of alternatives to the layering system for mixed conditions for example the Buffalo Clothing System is based on one layer of pile and pertex worn without a base or shell and relies on a combination of wicking and ventilation to keep cool and dispenses with complete waterproofing in favour of good wet insulation performance. Another alternative is the vapour barrier system which is based on caving gear and dispenses with breathability in favour of a completely waterproof shell which maintains a layer of damp but warm air around your body a bit like a wetsuit. In practice it comes down to what works for you and allowing some margin for unexpected conditions a big part of the equation is what is comfortable in the range of conditions that you are likely to encounter some people hate getting wet and others hate feeling sweaty. Personally I go for a system which breathes well in most conditions and still insulates well when it's sopping wet this consists of : merino wool base layer (doubled up if it's very cold, pertex/pile jacket, cotton gaberdine or gore-tex shell depending on season) 

Trapping can be effective with very simple equipment and a properly designed and constructed trap should either kill the animal outright (preferable) or not be easy to escape from. Also bear in mind that in many cases improvised traps may be illegal (in a non-emergency situation) so it may not be possible to test them in real world conditions. Trapping is not just about being able to build the trap itself, you also need local knowledge of animal behaviour and geography to have a decent chance of a trap being effective for example knowing what species are in a particular area, which are worth targeting and where to place a trap for it to be effective. The big advantage of trapping it that it can provide you with high energy food for relatively little physical effort. Equally in a longer term situation just the fact of doing something positive to improve your situation can be an important psychological factor and any success at all will be a big moral boost. Whether or not it is worth your time to learn is really up to you to decide. It is fairly unlikely that you will end up in a situation where lack of food becomes a life or death issue and you also have the opportunity to set up traps. Certainly I would say that it is a fairly low priority as a survival skill compared to things like making fire, finding water, navigation and medicine. 

If you are concerned about sharpening I would suggest that the best advice is to find a knife which is easy to sharpen rather than one which doesn't need sharpening. A lot of cheap consumer knives are fairly poor quality stainless steel which is heat treated somewhat on the hard side. These tend to get blunt more slowly but when the really do need sharpening it is a horrible job, especially for a novice. There really isn't such thing as a knife which never needs sharpening and if it isn't sharpened it will become increasingly frustrating and indeed dangerous to use. Much better is to sharpen little and often, a bit of simple edge maintenance every time you use it is much less effort in the long run. In general terms plain carbon steel blades, well heat treated, will be easiest to sharpen. Large scale manufacturers tend to avoid carbon steels as 'stainless steel' look better in a brochure but for the same money a carbon steel blade will often perform better. In fact for a novice knife user there is not a lot wrong with the basic opinel no7 There are also a number of guided sharpening systems available which make maintenance much easier for example the Spyderco Sharpmaker is well thought of. While these aren't cheap a sharp cheap knife is better than a blunt expensive one. 

In poor visibility you need to fall back on the basic navigational techniques of dead reckoning and any terrain features that you can still positively identify and follow. Dead reckoning involved keeping close track of the direction you are walking in and how far you walk. With practice this can be reasonably accurate, especially if you can augment is with hints from the terrain eg whether you are going uphill or downhill. However the problem is that even with great care it is easy for errors to accumulate and difficult terrain can make distance estimation very difficult. You can compensate for this to some extent be being conservative in your navigation eg by taking a route which is easy to follow rather than the quickest or most direct. For example by following a ridge, stream or treeline. Similarly if you are aiming at a point on a linear feature for example a bridge over a river it is safer to 'aim off'. For example if you know there is a bridge due north of you crossing a river which runs east-west, then rather than taking a bearing due north aim off to the east by a good margin so that you know for sure that when you strike the river you need to head west to find the bridge. Another key point is that if it looks like the weather might be closing in, that is the point to stop and make absolutely sure that you know where you are and double and triple check it. At this point make a decision about whether to continue on your planned route, stop, turn back, find an alternate route or head for an achievable place to wait out the bad weather. If you know your exact location when visibility gets bad (which you should) then think carefully about the worst case scenario of getting badly lost falling off a cliff or stumbling into a bog is going to be worse than an unplanned night on a hill. 

Often absolute strength isn't that important and it's certainly not just a case of dragging yourself up with your arms and really it is more about technique than brute force. Equally many people will find that finger strength (and abrasion resistance) is the first limiting factor and it's fairly hard to train that other than by climbing. Most climbing walls will offer taster sessions and beginners courses which will allow you to try it out and learn the basic skills and safety for very modest expense and the chances are that there will be routes which you can manage without a great deal of difficulty. There are various grading systems in use for difficulty but the easiest are not much harder than climbing a ladder so it is very likely that there will be a few that you can successfully climb on your first day and then just step up the difficulty to see where your initial limit is. Also if you do a day course for beginners you will be with a group of other novices and an instructor who knows that you are novices and has an strong incentive to encourage you to come back so there should be no particular reason to feel awkward. Equally while indoor climbing is usually done in pairs with one climbing and one belaying in turns there is no reason why you both have to do the same routes so it is perfectly feasible for two climbers with different levels of ability to partner up as long as you are both happy with the other person's competence in belaying. For many people the challenge and excitement is in progressing and it is just as satisfying to master your first route at the next grade up whatever the level of relative difficulty. Equally doing a challenging move 20 m above the ground will get your attention and demand the sort of concentration you are looking for at whatever level of difficulty. 

You could always improvise a simple sled from branches to protect the side which is sliding over the rocks. It might also be worth repacking it so that any external pockets are empty and can be taped flat to the main pack so they are less vulnerable. Another approach is to pack your kit in individual lightweight nylon bags which are light enough to be lowered more easily and lower your pack empty so there is less weight forcing it against the rocks. Eg food in one bag, spare clothes in another etc etc. There are also some other good reasons for doing this in general. If this is something you do regularly it might also be worth identifying which parts are likely to rub and giving them a bit of extra protection, perhaps with a section of plastic cut from a plastic bottle etc or leather if you want something a bit more fancy. The most sophisticated version of this would be to use the kevlar self adhesive tape used for emergency repairs to sails, in fact as you already have a rip this is a logical way to repair it. I would be reluctant to carry a large, heavy duty bag just for this one part of the trip and if this is a situation which only occurs every so often I would look for a quick and dirty (and above all lightweight) solution. 

Any system which relies on preventing kids form exploring while outdoors seems to be both self-defeating and unlikely to work. My advice is to talk to them about what they should do if they do get lost so they can help in their own rescue. Similarity putting too strong a prohibition on wandering off is only likely to make them more prone to panic and forget safety instructions if they do. Simple things can make the campsite easier for anybody to find if they do get lost at night. 

In this sort of situation a chest harness is reasonable because its main purpose is to keep you attached to the route via a short sling as protection against slips as opposed to actual climbing where long, high energy falls might be expected. So it should not be loaded with much more than you body weight and it it more about stopping a fall than arresting one. Also for a harness issued to the general public a chest harness is likely to fit better, be more comfortable and be harder to fall out of than a sit harness, which generally needs to be well flitted and adjusted to work and may fail if you fall inverted (more likely for an inexperienced climber on a 'walking' but exposed route). Also in this situation you are less likely to be actually injured by falling and you aren't going to fall far there is a good chance that you could self rescue by pulling yourself back onto the ledge. Note that this is an entirely different situation from climbing on a long rope while belayed.
