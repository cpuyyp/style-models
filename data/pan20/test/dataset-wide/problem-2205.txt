Remember, it's a game you love playing. It's shouldn't be giving you negative energy The more you practice, the better you will be, at whatever you're practicing. The less frustrated you will be. There's only you to blame (not shoes, racket, shuttle or opponent) Try using a personal (funny) word in order to express your frustration, in stead of yelling/cursing. 

Searching the internet for a possible answers, made me realize that this question has been asked many times before. The answer to the question is: no. Below some of the things I found along the way. 

All has to do with the so called sweet spot. The higher the tension, the smaller the sweet spot, the less likely for you to hit optimally. After a racket has been restrung, tension usually drops a bit (0.5 - 1.0 kg), maintaining a steady tension afterwards. Restringing a racket (for me at least) only happens when one of the strings snap. Only experienced players or (semi)-professional players will notice a decline in racket tension. You shouldn't be worrying about that. 

In my younger years, when I still played football, I got rid of the dirt underneath my football shoes by smashing them against one of the goal posts. I remember the sound to have a high pitch. What kind of material are the goal posts made of, used at the FIFA World Cup 2014? 

high racket tension allows for more precise hitting, but requires more experience low racket tension will give you more control. but with less accuracy 

The tape comes with a self adhesive side, allowing you to stick it everywhere. According to the description, 4 inch / 10 cm would yield approximately 1 gram. Usage I chose the following areas to stick the lead tape on: 

Answer: to give the top badminton players of the world the best playing experience there is. This particular shuttlecock is especially prepared for those events only. In this YouTube video, a match between Lee Hyun Il and Marc Zwiebler - Olympics 2008 round 16, a German commentator is making note of the special shuttlecock: 

Like the reversed slice (cross) dropshot, the intention is to make your opponent think, you're hitting a clear or dropshot. With the reserved backhand slice drop shot, your opponent will think you're trying to hit a clear (as Jonassen thought twice). Key is to put in the same amount of energy (racket motion), as to hitting a clear, but at the end perform a reversed slice. 

Bowling strike rate means number of balls needed to bowl for a bowler to take a wicket. We can only find the bowling strike rate of that bowler after he takes a single wicket. So, the bowling strike rate is undefined. It will be mentioned as in his carrier profile. For example, take a look at Hashim Amla's profile. His bowling strike rate and average for test matches is mentioned as . He bowled more than 50 deliveries without taking a wicket. 

The players are given points and rankings by ICC by following basis: For a batsman, the factors are: 

This can be easily done in slow/medium pace deliveries. Consider a batsman getting bowled in a no-ball or a free-hit ball and the ball remains near the batsman. Is it allowed to hit the ball with the bat/leg by the batsman to get runs? 

Consider the following situation, Batsmen A and B are playing, A is facing the ball and hits the ball inside the ground. Both of them running between the wickets and meet at the centre of the pitch, they saw that the ball is thrown to one end. The player with the ball is waiting without stumping. Then both the batsmen run towards the other end and reached the crease and then now the fielder took off the bails at the other end. Both the batsmen don't want to give up. Who is out at this situation according to the rules of cricket/ICC? The stumping may be done on either A's end or B's end. 

Stump cameras were first used in 1992 cricket world cup, a tournament of several innovations in modern cricket like colored player clothing, white cricket balls, black sight screens etc. Source. 

If rain fall a full day on final matches of a big tournament, then the teams will be declared joint winners. This is the rule on current ICC champions trophy. But, in 2002 ICC Champions Trophy final between India and Srilanka, when the result was not able to find as the minmum number of overs required for DL method was not bowled, the match was rescheduled to the next day. But, the same story continues on next day, then both the teams were announced joint winners. Source -wikipedia. 

Melbourne Cricket Ground is the largest cricket ground by area. The playing area in the  MCG is 172.9m x 147.8m. If we consider the boundary length of the cricket ground, ICC stated about this in the playing conditions that, 

I want to extend the number of strokes I can play in my badminton matches. Therefore I want practice a particular badminton stroke, called: 

Can somebody tell me how to perform such a stroke and most preferably provide me some footage of such a stroke being performed in a real match situation? 

Watch the following video's from Mr. Jae Bok Lee about: Poor Badminton Player's Behaviour Part 7, 12 and 13 are particularly of interest. His perception could give you some further leads or inspiration. Note: I'm not affiliated to the creator of the video's 

Is it allowed to play a racket game, like badminton or squash or tennis or table tennis, both left or right handed at the same time? So, if the ball or shuttle is played towards the backhand side, the player switches from a right hand play to a left hand play. Can you show me a video reference of such taking place in a match? 

Hu Yun Lately Hu Yun has gotten my attention with his performance in the below mentioned tournaments. He plays with a white Yonex racket. Does anybody know the type of racket he plays with? References 

Most probably the goose feathers are obtained from the northern part of the Republic of China. The cold conditions have an effect on the density of the feathers, giving extra insulation during cold weather. When these types of feathers are used to prepare shuttlecock from, the shuttlecock will have a more precise and consistent fight behaviour, over the standard available feathers. 

Is it allowed, in badminton (mix) doubles, to use your partner to gain more height in order to perform a jump smash for example? 

Lead Tape This is the best solution there is. Having read this racket review from Paul Stewart about making a racket more head-heavy, I immediately ordered some tape: 

Why does the BWF/IOC chooses an even higher quality shuttlecock, that may only be used during international events like the World Championship and the Olympics? 

After having seen Brazil win its match against Chile 3-2 on penalties, I was wondering how the overtime is played. Is that sudden death? 

My attempt to use the outside of the frame works, but after a few training sessions, the tape will gradually lose its adhesive power: 

LAWS OF BADMINTON According to the official LAWS OF BADMINTON (2012), set by the Badminton World Federation, chapter 9 is applicable: SERVICE. In that chapter, no reference can be found of the fact that a specific time interval needs to be taken into account or that the shuttle needs to be fully released. The following is to mention about "taking your time": 

The first Twenty 20 world cup was played in the year of 2007 but, the super over was introduced by ICC only in the year of 2008. When India and Pakistan's match went for tie in the first T20 world cup, Bowl-Out method was used to break the tie. Then, the super-over method was introduced to replace bowl-out method in 2008. 

In Sachin's farewell's match, I saw a quote in Cricinfo that Dhoni can hand-over the captaincy to Sachin to honour him like he did that for Saurav. 

It is an action in which a fielder illegally alters the condition of the ball. It'll make the fast bowlers ease to swing the ball in the air. So, it is easy to bowl reverse swing with (early overs)new balls. 

I can't understand the above concept clearly. Please, provide the exact formulas(ie, explain clearly) for calculating the net runrate in IPL with authentic references(with examples). 

The only benefit that the batting team can gain is the batsman's wicket. But, there is a chance for them, if the ball was given crease no-ball in the review, they will get one run and an extra ball to chase the target. 

The umpires will find whether the ball is tampered. They shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. If the umpires together agree that the deterioration in the condition of the ball is greater than is consistent with the use it has received then they will apply the Law 42.1 on this action as an unfair Play. 

We can see many times, the captains and the players of the bowling team were suspended for slow over-rates. 

ie, Domestic matches like IPL is not a matter here. As this question is based on stats and could be modified in future, an answer with link will be better. 

As per the ICC playing conditions of Umpire reviewing system, still the bowling team will win the match. 

Minimum number of overs allowed per day in a test cricket match is 90. What is the maximum number of overs allowed to bowl? If 2 or 3 more overs required to win the match means, who will decide whether to extend the match or declare it as a draw? 

Is it permitted to place the fielders other than the standard fielding positions terms in international cricket match? To be more specific, can a fielder be placed in 

This particular stroke is very difficult to perform, let alone to pronounce. Timing is of the essence and technical ability is there to follow. I found a few video's of two of the top players in current badminton. Lee Chong Wei On the 17th of March 2009, Lee Chong Wei and Kenneth Jonassen were playing an exhibition match for the inauguration of a new badminton sports hall in the town of Pécs in Hungary. In the second game Lee Chong Wei (LCW) performs two times the stroke you want to learn: 

If you do the above (with or without holding the shuttle), then you're safe !! PS: I've just tried hitting a shuttle by holding it: that's merely impossible, without smashing your fingers..... 

I've been playing badminton for quite some time now and was wondering if my badminton skills help me in the cricket game? Should I be more fit to be a batsman (hand-eye coordination), defending the wicket, or should I focus on being a bowler (smash, clears). 

According the official LAWS OF BADMINTON, set by the Badminton World Federation, chapter 13 is affected: FAULTS. Here the different situations are outlined when it is considered a 'fault' and in paragraph 13.3.8 the following about that is mentioned: 

Best is to stick it on the inside of the frame. This will give less problems when the racket needs to be restrung and the forces act upon the tape or pass by it: 

I've searched the internet and found some really good "How To's". Here's a list of video instructions: 

In this video (0'30") on YouTube, an alleged attempt is made to perform a Triple Lindy, but I think it's just a faulty dive. In this interview, the director Alan Metter explains the origin of the Triple Lindy: 

Reading your post, made me think of my younger years !! It's very difficult to give a conclusive answer, but here's what I have to say about that: 

Having seen the schedules for the different groups in the group stage, at the FIFA World Cup 2014, I noticed in Group C an odd starting time. It is match number 6 on the 14th of June 2014, between Ivory Coast and Japan, that starts at 22.00 (UTC-03). Why is that?
