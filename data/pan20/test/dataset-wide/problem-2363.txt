There is always a cause. Moods are often caused by something physical. Unrestful sleep, toxins circulating in the brain, lack of certain hormones/nutrients etc. You can eat healthy, exercise, meditate, but ultimately these moods will come and go. You succumb to unwholesome behaviours, because of the force of habitual tendencies, reacting a certain way towards these moods. Since there is no ''controller, persona, immutable self'' we cannot simply make them go away at will. In this case ''a bad mood'' will lead to ''grief'' if not observed objectively. Patiently enduring the mood, not trying to push it away, not reacting towards it. To rest with things as they are, regardless of conditions. ''Ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.'' As confidence in the practice grows, so will ardency. 

Yes. Not seeing things as they really are. Identifying with things as being I or mine. When covetousness leads to hatred, it means that you were not being mindful, and therefore did not apply the correct antidote, which is letting go. As soon as greed or aversion arises in the mind, it must be seen/observed with proper insight and let go of. Also, as Chris mentioned you can also apply mudita, after having observed the arising and ceasing of envy. 

Practice : Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw Is there any "Gatha" (Verse) can be used to contemplate on "Death"? The purpose is to use as an aid to generate necessary energy to continue practice [mostly as the first thing in the morning] 

I mostly practice "daily life" meditation and I found this specific question very important ( I have got some illnesses due to this too) I get intention to eat when I see "sweets" even I'm not hungry . Also eat more if it is a food I really "like" . So I use mental notes "Craving , Craving " and "liking , liking " respectively . Sometimes it passes away . But mostly it moves to " intending , intending " and then "eating" steps. "Suppressing" works temporally but I know this is not the purpose of meditation. I always try my best to follow below instructions, 

In five aggregates I'm bit confused when it says Perception and Consciousness are temporary . I can see form , feelings and formations are temporary by practice. Could someone provide me some more context to see this in practice ? 

Pa-Auk Forest Monastery, in Myanmar (Burma). $URL$ However, you will have to develop access concentration before you can begin Vipassana (Satipatthana). You may remain there for a period of months or years, even lifetime if you are able to renew your visa each year. You also have the chance to ordain after a few weeks or months, once deemed trustworthy. At first you will be able to get a visa of 3 months and extend the visa for a 1 year period each time. Yearly visa is about 100$ US. May you realize Nibbana and know true peace and freedom, friend. 

Continuous mindfulness is the key. You must learn to let go of that hatred. You must renounce hatred, anger, once and for all. Whenever such a thought arise ''I don't like people, I hate people'', you must be aware and know it as it is. Observe the related thoughts and feelings in an objective manner, without reacting, by simply turning, holding and sustaining your attention to what has just appeared, just at time of its duration. You must ''decondition'' the habit pattern you have created. Later on, metta will arise naturally. Or at the very least it will be quite easy to cultivate. 

Practice : Meditation using breath I'm practicing sitting meditation using breath according to Thai Forest Tradition method. Mentally reciting of "Buddho" . I practice at home so would like to get help based on my experience so far I noticed my breath getting shorter and sometimes period of no breath or "nano/very short" size of breath . When it is a series of "nano/very short" size of breath , mostly what I experience is "waiting" for next "in" breath ? Is this right or where should I concentrate during such occasions ? 

Practice Ven . Mahasi Sayadaw tradition I spend most of my unproductive time (traveling , when nothing special to do ) on reading Dhamma books using my iPhone. These moments are not appropriate for sitting or walking meditation , so I follow "daily life" instructions can be found here $URL$ But when I try to make a clear thought "reading" while reading I find it interfere with reading . How should I use clear thoughts to be mindful when reading ? 

What is the correct use of manasikƒÅra ( attention ) and Citta in the context of Mindfulness ? Is there any difference in terms of spiritual effect of keeping attention while I do daily works and keeping attention on breath with the mental recitation of "Buddho" ? 

By walking the path yourself you will be of great benefit to others. You are giving the gift of harmlessness. A living example of the Dhamma, which is the path of complete peace and freedom. The Buddha was a liberated one, a pure being, a great one. He no longer had any attachments whatsoever. Helping others when asked or when a situation arises (proper, beneficial) is what pure beings do. Having eradicated all mental defilements. Freed from avidity, anger, no longer having any kind of delusion, ignorance about the true nature of things. Pure beings will never harm others, in any circumstances. Any possibilities to do so can no longer manifest themselves since they can no longer arise. Therefore they would never resort to violence, aggressive behavior and such. What would the Blessed one do? I can only speculate for I am not such a great one... It is said that the Buddha had supramundane powers. He knew exactly what was proper, as in the right course of action, what and when it was beneficial. If reasonable and wise words could be beneficial in that particular instance, he would speak such words. If not, he'd probably radiate metta ''goodwill'' and be on his way. 

I'm trying to anchor my awareness while sitting at the desk. When bringing awareness to the body , I'm getting a tickling/tingling in the body . So to make it bearable I'm trying to move attention to different body parts and it keeps following too. So unable to hold awareness in the body for a long time. Is there any advice/guide on this ? 

What is the right mindset we should have towards physical exercises according to buddhist practice ? e.g. Weight training , cardio , running etc. In my case I'm spending most of my day sitting at desk , so having some exercise is necessary to be healthy . But would this consider as clinging to body? I can understand having supplements such as protein shakes could be considered as clinging. 

And I found "- When you are aware of the taste, knowing" is extremely momentary compare to other steps (relatively longer when having a beverage like coffee or soft drink) . Sometimes I miss that step completely . How should I handle "intention"(cetanaha) of eating without "suppressing"? 

I presume that your object is the breath, crossing the anapana spot (under the nostrils, on the upper lip). You must be careful since wanting the Nimitta to appear will actually prevent it from appearing. As long as you desire such things, to experience Nimitta or Jhana, it will simply never happen. Let go of such expectations, completely. Also, by wanting Nimitta to appear, there is a very high chance of it being the product of your imagination. You must let it be, do not give it any attention. Nimitta will strengthen, stabilize, and merge with the object on its own. Always remain with the object. 

In reality there are no schools, only the Dhamma. The Dhamma is about the true nature of things, the nature of reality. In this day and age where there are many schools, traditions, contradictory views and opinions, it can get complicated for people who have not yet experienced much of the Buddha's teachings, the Buddha-Dhamma. I would not rely on any schools if I were you. Also, there are suspicious suttas and even contradictory ones. Nonetheless, the original Nikayas are the most accurate records of what the Buddha taught. But since the Buddha is not here to teach us anymore, the second best option is to listen to advice from wise teachers who have true experiential wisdom. Who they are? that will be for you to decide. Personally, I would recommend that you read from such venerable ones. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, Ajahn Chah, Pa Auk Sayadaw , Mahasi Sayadaw. - $URL$ And these books 

The life current is extremely strong, if I consciously bring my attention to a single breath, a single movement of my abdomen, a single moment of my weight or sensation of my sitting bones during daily life, would it still be beneficial to my inner transformation? Or is it long hours of (15min plus) sitting meditation, body scanning is only counted? 

Now I want to be aware about myself while being absorbed in reading or be aware about the reader while reading Could anyone provide me a guide to proceed to that ? 

Is there a version of Satipatthana Sutta in English AUDIO . I have got the pali version but I do not understand the full meaning when I listen to it.The idea is to listen every day when I go to work and come home after work. 

I'm looking for an accurate translation of "Satipatthana Sutta". Could someone let me know what is the best available accurate translation? I don't want to be confused by just reading all available versions. Thank you
