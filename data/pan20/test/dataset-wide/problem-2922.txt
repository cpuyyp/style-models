Kants antinomies showed that there were limits to reasons reach; hence one has other modes of thought, which though not neccessarily truthful in the sense of reason may have significance or truth in their own mode. This is why, for example, in Badiou system, he had four modes of truth - which he calls truth procedures - science, art, love & politics (notably not religion, as he's an athiest); philosophy he suggests, produces no truths itself; in this he's aligning himself with the Socratic procedure of critical enquiry and being a 'mid-wife' to truth-procedures pregnant with truths, whilst keeping truth procedures honest. 

Epistemology in Indian philosophy is divided into six pramanas (proof or rather, and more correctly given the association proof has in Western Rationalism as being orientated to mathematics - the means towards true knowledge). These are: 

Arjuna slay thy doubts and slay thy fears: Cast your clouds upon the sea; And then your storms upon the lands. 

In formal logic question marks aren't used; one has to understand this from the context; I could write this out as 

I haven't read anything by Dennet, so I can't comment directly; but it might be worth noting that an illusion exists: it exists as an illusion; but what is of course being implied here is that it is not the most basic level of reality. For example, Kant has Objects impress themselves on the Sensibility as Sensation; this Sensation is what is called Qualia, and notably Objects are ontologically more basic here than the Sensation they cause; in that ontological relation one could call Sensation illusionary - but that gives, I would suggest the wrong impression ie they are not real. 

It was here that the concept of alienation was isolated; but this is only one dimension of said concept. For Simone Weil, a Marxist intrellectuel who worked in a French factory for three months she discovered that a factory creates: 

In Hayeks Road to Serfdom, he distinguishes between central planning & decentralised planning. And states that decentralised planning makes the most sense, since the available information is too large to collect for any central planning to be effective. Given the current technological climate its easy to forsee that the collection of price sensitive information can be made, in principle. How does this affect Hayeks theory? 

Kantian idealism, in its Copernican turn from the object to the subject already pre-supposes the existence of mind as a given; and the distinction between the two realms - objects as matter without mind, and subjects with mind. Kant takes for granted that to have experience, there is something that experiences - in more modern language, it has qualia; he further takes for granted, an axiom that wouldn't be contested - it certainly isn't by Descartes cogito: I think therefore I (am a mind) that exists - this is the picture of the Averronian floating man; or again, much later, and picturesquely put into the argot of Science Fiction brains in a vat. 

Infinity is a difficult and subtle concept; Aristotle distinguished between actual and potential infinity. The potential infinity is like the sequence 1,2,3,... You know you can always go on, but at any point of time you have only a finite set of numbers; and not an infinite one; so Aristotle could justifiably say this was only infinite potentially, as you by your hand haven't grasped an infinite set of numbers. Aristotle considered that sensible (ie physical in contemporary scientific language) can only ever be potentially infinite; and never actual; and this has generally been the case: consider that singularities (infinite density) in black holes are problematic, as are infinities in Feynman Diagram calculations in QED, or infinite speed. So, what about actual infinites - are there any such things? Well, mathematics can complete the sequence above; this new ideal element is called omega; but the same problem that Aristotle identified creeps up again - but more subtly. Since we can have omega, omega+1, omega+2... However, at any point of this sequence we, unlike the earlier example, have an infinite set; so strictly speaking Aristotle was wrong here; but in a larger sense he was right since this infinity is still incomplete. 

Definitions aren't the same thing as Demonstrations; and usually they come after. For example, its easy to demonstrate that numbers are useful; and no-one bothered to define them for two millenia. This doesn't mean that definitions aren't useful - they obviously are; but one must have a clear sense of what purpose they serve. This is akin to the difference between Knowledge by acquaintance/presence and knowledge by descripton/reference. I can refer to a tree or describe a table, but this doesn't dispense with actually seeing a tree or using a table - say in setting out dinner for four, and a stranger amongst them. One has to be acquainted with beauty before beginning to talk about it (aesthetics), and one should be acquainted with the conversations that preceded yours - or at least their high points (so you might aim towards them) or their low points (so as to know what to avoid); similarly with ethics. 

Given our understanding of physical phenomena and cosmology, we have strong evidence when there was no life on this planet. Presumably this was evident too in Kants time. How does Kant answer this objection? A similar but more prosaic and quotidian way of putting this - is that there are more than one thinking subject, I see some born and some pass away. That the world no longer exists for a subject that has died is so obvious that Kant cannot mean this. Then what does he mean by the 'whole material world must at once vanish'? 

Parmenides said that all was one. Thales said that one was water, perhaps meaning a single physical substance that all draw their being from. Nagarjuna says that one is essenceless. Brahman identifies that one with self, with will. And Al-Hallaj said the One was truth, was himself. Physical science is working its way to saying that all is one - and that it can be described. Though their current manifesto is to tie all the known forces into a unity, and although they've dissolved the boundary between energy and matter, there remains a tripartite distinction between energy, force & spacetime. But given time, will & sufficient imagination they may yet pull off a unification of these three empirical domains. But Descarte pointed out, and no doubtless others well before him, that the mental world and the physical world itself remains a boundary that seems unbreachable. The qualia of our impressions and our consciousness is real. No modern science has dared to suggest or imagine how the two can be reconciled. Philosophy has struggled with the issue for millenia. That the one can be divided is a fiction. But it's a useful fiction so long as one bears in mind that it remains a fiction, and that the empirical domain is by no means the whole of what is real. That physical monism is not metaphysical monism and that it has ramifications beyond that of its intended domain. 

This makes it obvious what the connection is to the above sentence; there are two parts to this sentence and the first part 'IsGreek' is called the predicate, and the second part 'Socrates' is called the subject. This is a style of refering to propositions that one sees in verbose programming languages; but equally I could write it out more enigmatically as: 

But if a little oil is spilled, or a little wine is stolen - do not start raging. Perhaps laugh: this slave is always a little clumsy. But she sings well. Or he plays with the children well. Through this your estate and yourself are tranquil. 

I'm sceptical of any claims that anyone can directly visualise higher dimensional spaces. People who do work with them develop an intuition for them but this is because they understand what the important properties are and how they inter-relate. I'm also sceptical that being able to visualise is sole key to understanding; this, on the face of it, seems wrong since when we see something we grasp it all at once advocated by the saying 'seeing is believing'; take for example, a square. If I show you this and say, how many corners does it have, you can immediately grasp what it is you are seeing and say, 'well, it has four corners'; then if I presented you with a 60-sided polygon and asked the same question, no-one will be able to grasp at once how many corners there are and the best that can be done is to count them. So here we see that being able to visualise, though important, is not the sole key to understanding. When it comes to higher dimension because there is no possible direct visual representation then it solely symbolic representation here that matters. For example, the usual Pythagoras theorem is 

And of course, mathematicians talk about good mathematics, or beautiful mathematics or what ought to be the case (the Kantian triple, in a sense; but mostly not) and this, to some extent, justifies the description above. It is one of the purposes of a good mathematical education to enstill these values - usually called mathematical maturity - which are in a sense, unencodable, into the human substance; hence the institutions and traditions of this craft. To come back to your specific question; higher-dimensional geometry was developed post the advent of coordinates by Descartes, (that 'honest' thinker in Kierkegaards phrase, who used doubt as a tool and not as a scalpel - critique rather than criticism); in that language it's easy to generalise that most basic of identities - the one of Pythagoras; no visualisation is necessary as would have been in the geometric imagination; one can then push through calculus in this context using the technology of vector spaces and then manifolds; in both cases, there is a natural metric, a natural way of measuring distance, which is related at a basic level to the Pythagorean theorem; in a different direction, metric spaces began to be investigated; these are just pure spaces with a different but related notion of distance, one even more basic than Pythagoras - I mean the triangle identity; it's hard to argue with, since it seems so natural; and so basic; and thus one might argue this ought to be enough; but it was noticed in many arguments that the metric wasn't necessary and one could use open sets; this is an important innovation, because it drops the measuring rod and instead, for lack of a better word, uses 'place', the word used by Aristotle in his investigation of space; in a way it measures space by space itself - the measurement is commensurable (like changes like, so like measures like). Aristotle, in his physics, linked this notion, Place, to ideas of change and variation, contiguity and continuity, and of the parts to the whole - all important notions. It's important to link the development of these notions to others; topology as a discipline wouldn't have been conceivable; or rather, it could be conceived as a Concept, and it was done so; but it couldn't be determined as an Idea (to steal a term from Hegel); that is placed in sharp relief in the axiomatic manner without a certain amount of technology; and that technology is what is now called Set Theory; and this Notion carries the basic idea that things are made of elements, of points. This is the modern view; the post-modern view is that extensionless points aren't neccessary, or are wrong, which was the view argued by Aristotle, in his investigation of continua; one can in fact, drop the points of a topological space, and just investigate its cohesive structure - it's topology - thus locale theory, or in a phrase that should be more famous than it is, 'pointless topology'. One can go further, homotopy theory is a sub-discipline in topology; and this uses the notion of paths; after much development, and many results; it was noticed that the subject could be 'axiomatised', and this is called abstract homotopy theory, and one of its main tools is 'model categories'; then in an another innovation, it was noticed that this was a 'coordinatisation' of infinity-categories: for not only are there paths between points, there are paths between paths; this again is an ancient observation, that can be traced to Parmenides, 'doesn't each notion of likeness, give rise to another, and then again'. Still, this shows that open sets are only one step, though a good strong step, in the long tradition of investigating space and continuity. Finally it's worth pointing out, that historically speaking that open sets were not the only way, then of tackling continuity; given that limits by sequences are the basic tool in analysis, one might expect it would be this tool that would be generalised; and this is possible - they are called nets, and not widely used; they have a dual form - filters - and these are used more widely; but open sets introduces a new idea, or rather return to us an old one, that space is cohesive, and that it can be 'unglued' into small pieces - note, that open sets have extension, that they are not points, and that their extension is not measured by a number - and then 'glued' back together; and it is this notion of 'gluing' which generalises to a more general context like sheaves and stacks. One might do without the 'Judgement of God' (and it sometimes appears that in this world one must); but one cannot do without Judgement altogether: culture, in its widest sense, being essential to man, in part his essence objectified, is also the objective manifestation of judgements; also too, in its widest sense. In Little Gidding, a poem by TS Eliot, he writes: 

In itself the cogito is free of doubt and true; but just by itself it leads to solipsism, or men considered as mental atoms; hence the modern theory of the Subject in European philosophy is more about inter-subjectivity. 

In both of these interpretations the State never depends on past states. However the Bohmian interpretation does, but this is due to its non-locality which is controversial to theorists, being attractive to some and deeply unattractive to others. Of course once one introduces special relativity one has problems with the idea of simultaniety. General Relativity brings along its own confusion with time as spacetime becomes dynamic. 

It's only really the success of the mechanistic philosophy following the success of Newtonian Physics that made neccessity and determinateness the irreducible point of physical phenomena; this is why when uncertainty was discovered in the early 20C, first empirically in radioactivity and then theoretically established in QM; it was seen as new phenomena, rather than a reintroduction and re-establishing of an old and antique idea. 

which by merely looking at it without any explanation tells you very little...could you guess that G(x) stands for "Is x Greek?" 

ie this is what in contemporary book-keeping language is called overheads; in physical language we might call it friction which slows the smooth circulation of money and goods (which move in equal but opposite directions). Because he is interested in a theory of economics rather than its actual specifics, he presses the point that: 

According to Weber, one of the defining conditions for a state is a monopoly of violence; exerted outwards this is military force. The most ethically ideal situation where military force is legitimately used is in self-defence from from an unprovoked attack. In Hobbes account it is a legitimate power and duty of what constitutes government. For this to occur a standing army is required as one cannot know when such an attack may happen; but this means an apparatus of recruitment and training is required. So on the whole no. This doesn't mean that in certain situations a military cannot become corrupted, or that the case for warfare cannot be weak or non-existent; or that certain persons within this apparatus are acting from cynical motivations - it can most assuredly happen. However one needs to at the least differentiate the individual from the apparatus, and the conditions that makes the apparatus neccessary.
