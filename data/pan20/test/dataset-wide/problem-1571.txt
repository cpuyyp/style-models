As an example, see this study: $URL$ Finger-length ratios and sexual orientation (Department of Psychology and Graduate Groups Neuroscience, Endocrinology, UCB) 

However, it doesn't look like there are a lot - or any - studies on the topic which are more legit (e.g. not based on "have you had sex recently" surveys) 

TOTAL: 167 tonnes of Platinum produced worldwide in 2001. Another source was found by following a link in comments to that ZeroHedge post, listing 180 tons as average annual production (6Mil oz). So, the estimate of world's platinum mining at 16 tonnes ever is definitely wrong, since we produced 10 times that in just 2001, and pretty much on the same level in the years since. 

Unit 43753 appears like a big spender. It issued a whole boatload of tenders, both the amount and specific tenders match up with a possible NSA-like unit (e.g. people in charge of signals intelligence). Here's a sample tender from that DB for 2017: 

Given that forming falsifiable predictions is the cornerstone of scientific method, the above quote sounded pretty damning to me. QUESTION: Is it true that since 1980s, string theory - or at least parts of it associated with Anthropic principle have not made any (or any non-disproven) falsifiable predictions? Or was that comment somewhat hyperbolic? 

UPDATE: To further help illustrate the "headed" part, here is the projected SS Trust Fund reserve depletion years over 1985-2014 years from Social Security Adminitration "2014 OASDI Trustees Report" (Table VI.B1.—Long-Range OASDI Actuarial Balances  and Trust Fund Reserve Depletion Dates as Shown in the Trustees Reports for 1982-2014, Page 159). I plotted the years as well as the trendline in Excel based on the last column in that table. 

Y-Combinator cofounder and famous hacker Paul Graham publishes essays, and one of his recent ones was 2016 "The Refragmentation". One of the ancillary claims he made was that for the known founders of the big US companies (as of the middle of 20th century) were mostly NOT college educated and started out doing menial jobs (the implication being that well educated elite graduates of the mid-20th century didn't see themselves as startup founder materials back then, because they coudln't connect themselves conceptually with said original founders; and thus preferred career of executive in existing large companies). 

It is theorized that the very-rarely-used name was derived from a Welsh name rooted in "gwen-" which means "white/dazzling/holy". From what I have seen, there is no evidence to prove or dis-prove whether Barrie was aware of the existence of the Welsh-derived name or not; but due to its rarity pre-Peter-Pan, it is quite plausible that he was not aware and re-invented it on his own. 

It was a common claim when I grew up that eating a lot of sunflower seeds (most versions of the claim were specific to unhulled seeds) increase appendicitis risk or assuredly cause appendicitis (in more extreme versions). Examples of the claim: 

On the other hand, I found at least one study which contradicts this on some level. to whit, the study showed 

It's impossible to prove a negative, but it's really hard to see how this isn't a misattribution. Google search offers only 4 unique links (7 including duplicates) searching for "Tony benn" + "establishment became established"; one of which is this question you asked. One is from a random blog (no citations/proof offered) from 2010: $URL$ One in a random comment on a forum thread from 2015 (I'll give you one guess on how well sourced that is). The only meaningful one from non-blog source seems to be 2015 Herald Express piece by Frank Sobey which says: 

In other words, of 21 in 2015, ZERO were proven to be violence aimed at someone's TG status by HRC or by justice system; and only 4 had at least some possible evidence presented by HRC indicating it may have been due to TG status. 

Please note that in addition to classified proprietary tech, the modern movenet is towards using commercial capabilities. 

I think you first need to agree on a definition of "Bond Vigilante". ". In other words, they sell to achieve some sort of political policy goal. On the other hand, your own "e.g." merely says "examples of investors or investment firms that sold bonds en masse and in large scale from fear of inflation". In other words people who think selling bonds will make (or not lose) them money. 

Based on pure common sense and logic, it is obvious the military would be working on something like this. Heck, the thing is on the Wiki! What the feasibility status/progress is would be a different story. 

Leaving all those weaknesses aside, even if the numbers were accurate and statistics not misleading and the conclusions they want to draw actually followed from their statistics (none of which is the case), the numbers are too small to draw meaningful conclusion. As eyeballfrog's comment says: 

This isn't exactly to my satisfaction on scientificalness of approach, but the best numbers I was able to find so far come out of this:

This was supposed to help with upper respiratory viral symptoms, including nasal congestion and bad coughs. Is there scientific evidence that this helps? 

They don't even account for other risk factors than being transgender, even though they honestly mention one: 

More importantly, there seems to exist a series of similar certificates, both covering two entities but NOT always Unit 43753, linked in a comment by @Joker_vD below. 

The article goes on matching the breast shape to personality - I'm a bit hesitant to post specific details in the interests of keeping the site PG-13. It didn't bother specifying what the study being described is. 

Most of the time the claim is posted, it's posted with zero details or evidence (e.g. no citation or details of attribution). I verified this by following every single link from the first 4 Google pages searching for the quote (there were only 40 search results for me). The ONLY times any details are provided, they are "he said it in 1984 book" (Example). Well, THAT specific claim can be tested... and is false. That specific quote can be found in a 1984 book. Except, it was in a book "God Knows" by Joseph Heller, (more well known as the author of "Catch-22"), as can be found on WikiQuote. 

There's a widely held belief that garlic enhances immune system. I'll reuse the same links as my earlier "onion" question, but the purported mechanisms seem different, even if they are folded in the same articles: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Are there any studies proving or disproving the beneficial effects of the garlic on immune system? (I am specifically interested in resistance to cold/flu viruses, but the claims are frequently more generic). 

The title of the article is "Sorry, men ARE more brainy than women (and more stupid too!) It's a simple scientific fact, says one of Britain's top dons" - note the bolded part. The article makes two independent claims, only one of which is relevant to the social/political topic being discussed (lack of women in top positions): 

The immediate origin of the policy is Old Testament (the story of Onan) and is basically a legal interpretation of the overarching principle of "be fruitful and multiply". 

You are correct in your skepticism: USA has one of the highest top corporate tax rates, as well as taxes as percentage of income. For proof, 

Fluid intelligence (the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations) is an incredibly important piece of "computer abilities" in general. As shown by study cited below, it has a high heritability and therefore that means "being born" with "computer talents" is possible. 

Are there any studies supporting this? (e.g. that a "superstar" programmer would be 10x more productive than merely good programmer or 30-100x than average programmer respectively) Just to clarify - I'm not asking if Joel was correct in naming 100x more productive developers "superstars" - that's his definition. I'm asking if there are enough such 100x more productive developers (100x on average) to warrant a separate class. 

USSR state recording company Melodia helped Greenpeace raise money via co-sponsoring a jointly release album (U2 et al). $URL$ / $URL$ While there's no explicit mention of KGB, given the timeline, and the way USSR worked, it was 100% impossible that KGB wasn't in full explicit approval. The album was heavily promoted (I remember that myself), and Soviet press was quoted in 1989: “Everyone who buys the album can consider himself a member of Greenpeace, which means it will soon have millions of new members here in the Soviet Union.” Quoting from Russian Wiki (all quotes from that are sourced from Greenpeace itself - " История Гринпис (рус.). Greanpease.org. Архивировано из первоисточника 3 февраля 2012. Проверено 13 мая 2011): 

It probably isn't fake, because I was able to find a completely different independent article quoting David Prowse, from the same event, with 100% identical money quote: "son can't kill father, father can't kill son": $URL$

Since US population was ~300M in 2010, that means $2,000/year/person average in just the core means tested welfare programs - NOT including much larger and costly things that can be forever argued back and forth if they are "spending on american citizen". Also, note that this doesn't include debt interest, unlike the figure used for US aid to Israel. 

Additionally, the linked answer's question has a previous answer which also produced the similar conclusion from Oklahoma study (most earthquake increase is due to wastewater injection, not fracking) 

He also points out that the statistics could be even worse if not for the fact that many mass shootings aren't actually stopped by the police, but that the shooter kills himself; AND that at least 2 of the police ones were where a police was very greatly assisted by armed civilians. 

Latest study confirms that the chances increase due to a variety of factors diminishing immune response, at least in mouse cells: Temperature-dependent innate defense against the common cold virus limits viral replication at warm temperature in mouse airway cells (Ellen F. Foxman, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1411030112) 

StraightDope has this one dissected pretty thoroughly. $URL$ TL;DR: No, there's nothing special about ship's captain job that lets them officiate a marriage, at least in the US Law. In other words, a ship's Captain can officiate a marriage only in the same circumstances that anyone else on the ship can - e.g. the couple would either have to be under jurisdiction of a state that recognizes common-law marriage, or the person doing the marrying (captain or not) has to be a clergy member or JD or other qualification recognized by the state. Relevant legal docs cited by StraightDope are: 

So; while Russia's rate is indeed, only officially 60% that of USA, it's incorrect to say that Russians don't get depressed. Additionally; mental health industry in Russia is far behind that of the USA; so it's not implausible that diagnosis rate is far lower in Russia. 

Not if you use meaningful definitions. First of all, as @Jonathon's excellent answer alredy pares down, 

Are men with shoe size 40 more faithful, and shoe size 43+ less faithful? The article sounds like the source is some weak analysis by a dating site "expert", so I'd prefer answers rooted in something a bit more rigorous if available. 

Is there evidence that this creme and/or ointment: "Helps promote healing of minor burns and cuts, scrapes, skin irritations and sunburn"? Specifically, is there any testing showing whether: 

Reliability of the source's data itself: Original source did NOT cite that statistics, although many other stats in that same article are well cited. As such, the data is NOT reliable, being un-cited. 

Now, lets' look at spending on aid for US citizens. Merely counting the most obvious bare-bones (social spending), which is entirely NOT apples-to-apples comparison, we get 

This seems to be a partial case of Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. There is one example that is usually cited the math site of it is on the Wiki article: 

Wait, did you mean "minted" or "mined/produced"? Your question mentions both words. No the world didn't produce 16 tons of platinum, but much more. See below for details. BTW, the "16 ton" figure you cited was from that blog's copy of ZeroHedge's graph, and the graph had "16 tons" as "All Platinum ever MINED", not "minted". So, let's look at the production of Platinum worldwide. UPDATE: For extra credit, I think I dug up where they got 16 tons from at ZeroHedge (thanks to commenters there): 

There appear to be evidence of similar certification of other antivirus products, here's one for "Dr. Web" issued several years ago: (in all fairness, this could have been a clever photoshop to remove suspicion from Kaspersky... but in that case the original image could be a clever photoshop to cast suspicion on Kaspersky... so let's not assume photoshopping either way or the question becomes meaningless). Note that this other certificate: 

The problem here is in how you define "inflation" and in the methodology differences in calculating it. As a great example of the latter, see Shadow Government Statistics's graph showing inflation using current vs. 1980 methodology: 

So, what the article claims is that the growth projection, if things remain unchanged, is $22M. Whether their projection analysis is accurate is a separate question (I wasn't able to find any independent analysis, and doing the analysis myself is off topic for Skeptics - you may want to ask on Finance or Economics or Statistics SE - it looks legit enough approximation to me to at least be in the right ballpark). 

Usage of logical fallacies: Possible but hard to ascertain given the lack of proper citations to proper research. Even if the stat is accurate, this research sounds like makes no effort to attribute the deaths to actual poverty, as opposed to causes that may be associated with poverty. To be clear, that doesn't make the claim untrue, just unproven. Relationship to the Facebook Post's conclusions Leaving aside the accuracy of the data or the claim, most of poverty-related-caused deaths clearly occur in 3rd world countries, NOT in capitalist countries, especially if you look at causes listed. As such, blaming capitalism for this is an absolutely false conclusion to arrive at. Moreover, it can be shown that capitalism was arguably the greatest contributor to reducing poverty. 

One interesting take on this is the following research article: "The Escape Drive in Domestic Cats and the Dog and Cat Relationship" (Source: Behaviour, Volume 5, Number 1, 1953 , pp. 81-84(4)) 

Therefore, the question is: Is there a reputable detailed benchmark-backed-up cost/benefit analysis of the SSD upgrade that is deep enough to consider multiple usage scenarios as well as costs of competing non-SSD upgrades? In other words, something that would back up Jeff's generic quoted claim in a majority of situations usage-wise and upgrade-wise. Please note that I'm looking for something REALLY in-depth - e.g. something that for example evaluates the possibility that a whole brand new PC can be built/bough for not much more than the cost of even a small-capacity high end SSD (this is important, since merely adding better components to a single PC may not give nearly the real life performance boost compared to having 2 PCs side by side for many usage scenarios), and/or something that benchmarks various possible upgrade combinations from base configurations. 

This question brought to you courtesy of a trip to a local supermarket. Browsing vitamins/supplements shelf, saw a bottle of Melatonin, on the bottle it said "Helps support sleep" Is this something proven by studies? 

P.S. As a caveat, Erhard Milch was not in the army (as your arguer claimed) - he was in the air force (Luftwaffe). So either the person was mistaken slightly, or they meant a different person and my asnwer is wrong. 

Here's another study showing placebo efficacy: Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL (1981). "Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain". Pain 10 (3): 379–89. doi:10.1016/0304-3959(81)90099-3. PMID 7279424 

As far as plausible mechanisms (discounting the psychic connection), none have been researched as far as cats, but we know that birds orient both by magnetic sensing and by the sun. Whether the cats can have a similar mechanism, or whether any of the rare known cases are just unlikely random events that happened, does not seem to be known.
