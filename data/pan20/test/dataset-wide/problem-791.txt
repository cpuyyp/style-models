All the photons being emitted do not 'fill in the blank' of the absorption line, because when they are emitted, most do not come towards us. You suppose that there will be some emitted from a different hydrogen atom elsewhere, that will just happen to aim a photon at us, but where will it come from? Think about how much of the sky the Sun subtends from our perspective. Now think about how much of the sky the Earth subtends from the perspective of an atom of hydrogen in the Sun's photosphere that is thinking about popping a photon out and wondering if it will head in the direction of Earth. Here is a 2D diagram - bear in mind that the atom actually is in 3D space and instead of being limited to only 360 degrees, can pop that photon off in any direction at all. 

This is partly a question of 'limiting magnitude' - the faintest magnitude that is visible using a particular instrument, or in this case, just the eye. +6 - maybe +6.5 - magnitude is sometimes used as a baseline expectation of what can be seen in dark skies sites. The most distant star that can easily be seen is Deneb. It is actually quite bright, at brighter than +2 Magnitude, but is (probably) 1425ly away. So though it is at quite some distance, it's luminosity means that actually, it isn't limiting magnitude that is at play. There are stars much further away that are at the barely perceivable limit, and seeing them will depend on conditions. The +4 mag mu Cephei is probably fairly achievable, at 5900ly, and V762 in Cassiopeia is about +6 mag and maybe 16000ly, which would probably be the record if you can actually see it, but you'll need special conditions. When it comes to galaxies, Andromeda is 2500000ly away, and +3.4, very visible and much further away than any individual star. If you have good conditions, the +5.7 mag M33 is slightly further away at 2900000ly, but it would be much harder to see. While the generally accepted limit is maybe +6.5, some people claim to have seen to +8. If it is possible, M83 is 14700000ly away at +8.2, with naked-eye claims reported. 

There is some evidence that Population III stars formed as early as 200 million years after the Big Bang. The oldest known star, the Methuselah Star, dates back to 200 million years after the Big Bang. It is a second generation star (judging from its metal content), so that means a generation of very large stars must have lived and died before this one was born. 

There was only one time in recorded history when a star was visible to the naked eye and not within our galaxy. That was Supernova 1987A. When the astronomer, Ian Shelton, first saw it through a telescope, he was amazed at how bright it looked. Thinking it might be naked-eye visible, he stepped out of the observatory and saw it within his own eye. Since then, all the stars you see are nearby stars within our galaxy. All naked-eye visible stars are within a 17 thousand light years. Most are actually within a few hundred light years, but there are some bright stars within the 47 Tucanae globular cluster that are 17 thousand light years away. 

Many, many moons throughout our solar system are tidally locked. $URL$ This wikipedia page lists 34 moons throughout our solar system that are known to be tidally locked, and another 26 that are suspected. It is very common for moons within a certain distance of their planets to be tidally locked. If they are too far away, they won't be tidally locked. Astronomers have even deduced that some exoplanets are tidally locked, but I have no idea how they know that. This leads to some interesting questions: 

You can't, not with that information. However if you also have the date and time, you'll be good to go: there are plenty of sites in the web with this information, such as: RA and DEC to ALT and AZ 

Your question presumes that the ISS is beyond Earth's gravity, that it has escaped earth's gravitational pull. This is not correct. All objects with mass in the universe affect all other things with mass in the universe, the effect just gets weaker with distance. So the ISS is feeling the effect of gravity from Earth significantly more than the moon is. The reason the ISS doesn't just fall to the earth, either directly or gradually spiralling towards the earth, is that it is travelling fast enough around the earth that it is continually "missing" earth. It is sometimes described as 'falling' constantly around earth. If I am to be properly correct though, the reality is that ISS is in fact falling towards the earth, getting closer and closer to Earth all the time. It needs occasional boosts to push it further back out in it's orbit. Just to blow your mind a little bit: The ISS is pulling on the Earth with the same force that the Earth is pulling on ISS. 

It isn't correct, because a vortex is not a helix, and so while the planets do trace a helical path as they move through the galaxy, this is not evidence of a vortex. Yes, the sun actually is moving through space, as it traces a path around the centre of the galaxy. The whole mass of the solar system moves with it, so the planets are not left behind as the sun moves. Rhys Taylor and Phil Plait have comprehensive smackdowns debunking this vortex idea and other misunderstandings/delusions by the author. 

Assuming you mean the Cosmic Microwave Background ... The CMB is entirely in a very narrow range of the microwave part of the spectrum. Galaxy emissions are all over the spectrum. The CMB comes uniformly from all over the sky. It's like looking at painting that is all one color. Galaxy light looks like pinpoints on a dark background. (Nearby galaxies are not pinpoints, but those at cosmological distances look that way.) The CMB matches the exact wavelength we expect for light that is heavily redshifted from the moment of last scattering. That moment was hundreds of millions of years before galaxies ever formed. Light from oldest galaxies are at a redshifted wavelength from 500 million years after the last scattering. If the CMB was due to early starlight reflecting off dark objects, you would see a very different spectrum. It would contain many absorption lines as the dark objects absorbed some wavelengths better than others. Also the reflected starlight would be across a wide range of frequencies, unlike the CMB which has a very narrow range. 

On the other hand, if our Solar System passes near a relativistic jet emanating from the central black hole of a galaxy, Earth will get hit with high speed particles that will disrupt the magnetosphere and ozone layer. Definitely not good for any life on Earth at that time. Getting ejected from the galaxy also means there is less chance of future humans exploring the galaxy by hopping to nearby stars. We'd only have our solar system to explore and colonize. There would not be another star system within a hundred thousand light years. 

It is great that you have an interest in astronomy. Unfortunately, the UK will be on the wrong side of the Earth to see the lunar eclipse on April 15. If you you want to experiment with various places on earth that will see it, and what they will see, get a planetarium application like Stellarium or SkySafari or TheSkyX. A lunar eclipse is always easy to spot - it is where the full moon is. Also, because it is the result of the Earth getting in the way of the Sun shining on the Moon, it is always after the sun sets and after the full moon rises in the East. That is, if you're going to be in a place to see the whole sequence, not just a part of it. Just so you know, the tetrad is not one but a series of lunar eclipses over 2 years, this is just the first lunar eclipse in the series. The last tetrad was 2003-2004, so you were around, but probably not paying as much attention at that time :-) Unfortunately, Cambridge UK will not see any of the first 3 eclipses in this tetrad. However the 28 Sept 2015 eclipse will be visible from that location. Incidentally, one of the better places to see this lunar eclipse will be Easter Island (Rapa Nui) which will see the whole eclipse, and with the totality occuring high in the sky, near the meridian. Also, not much light pollution. 

Our best guess is that if Venus had an ocean, it did 4 billion years ago. Then it had the runaway greenhouse effect due to its thick atmosphere. The runaway greenhouse effect would have boiled away the oceans if the planet ever had oceans. There are several guesses about why its surface is so young (300 million to 600 million years old). One is that the planet get so hot the entire surface melts. It has no plate tectonics and it has a super thick atmosphere to trap the heat. All that heat melts the surface every half billion years or so. Another reason is that it has many very large volcanoes. (167 volcanoes over 100 km across.) That's far more very large volcanoes than Earth has. Those volcanoes resurface the planet and keep it young. 

To say the "speed of light" is (mostly) about light is a common misunderstanding of that speed. It's actually the speed of causality, and it has far more implications that merely how fast photons propagate. It is also the conversion factor from mass to energy. (E = mc^2) When space expands the photons within it don't suddenly go faster to cover the expansion. Think of it this way. Let's say you have a beetle crawling across a rubber sheet and you stretch that rubber sheet to double its original size. Does the beetle suddenly start crawling twice as fast? No, the beetle still plods along at its same speed. Just like light crossing the universe. The universe expands and light has to take more time. 

We can't know this without knowing what the sky is like for your city. However, you can determine what the limiting magnitude is for your location, then you can set planetarium software to only display catalogued stars that are brighter than this limit. You can do this for naked eye objects, but you could also do this using your telescope to find the limiting magnitude for your equipment also. 

Here is what one commentator has said about TESS in comparison to PLATO: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), to launch in 2017, seems superficially to be a similar mission to Plato. It will potentially discover hundreds of planets before Plato even gets off the ground in 2024. However, the limited sensitivity of its cameras mean it is completely blind to Earth-like worlds around sun-like stars. Astroseismology is also off-limits for TESS, meaning the size of any worlds it does discover will be highly uncertain. Unlike Plato, it will also move between patches of sky every 30 days, allowing only hot, short-period planets to be found. With all other new telescopes, both in space and on the ground, limited to finding super-Earths around small stars, Plato is the only mission on the table truly capable of discovering an Earth-like world around a star like our Sun. And by targeting bright stars that allow atmospheric follow-up, it is not impossible to think that, as well as the first truly habitable planet, Plato could find the first inhabited one too.

The term for when the sun is at its highest is "solar noon". $URL$ It is the moment the sun crosses the meridian. The meridian is an imaginary half-circle that goes from the northernmost point on the horizon to the highest point directly above you and then to the southernmost point on the horizon. The sun is always at its highest point in its daily path when it crosses the merdian. You're right that in earlier centuries, each town would set its clocks at noon for when the sun was at its highest point. Those of us who are familiar with astronomy and history would call that type of timekeeping "apparent solar time". You can't guarantee an exact 24 hour day with "apparent solar time", so some people used "mean solar time" instead. (Historical note: Having each town choose its local noon became a nightmare for railway companies that wanted to set train schedules. So the railway companies urged the creation of 4 time zones in America and encouraged each small town to use "standard time" instead of "apparent solar time". And as rgettman already mentioned, the term for the sun's height above the horizon is "altitude". Astronomers use the term "elevation" for a person's distance above sea level. 

@Knu8 was right that adding mass to a gas giant will turn it into a star long before the gas giant could become a white dwarf or neutron star. But that works if you add fusionable material such as hydrogen. If you add something that can't fuse into a heavier element, such as Iron or Tin, the matter just keeps accreting onto the gas giant until the planet collapses under its own weight until electron-degeneracy pressure holds it up. That's when it becomes a white dwarf. Thanks @Knu8 for the right answer. I gave you an upvote for that. I posted a separate answer to describe what happens if you add heavier elements. 

Emission and Absorption lines are due to Kirchhoff's Laws that explain what happens when light passes through a gas. This is due to photons being absorbed by an atom or ion causing an electron to jump to a higher energy state, and photons being emitted when an electron returns to a lower energy state. Photons will only be absorbed by an atom or ion if they are of precisely the energy required to bump an electron up to an excited state. If they are not of the right energy, they pass unimpeded. Photons of particular wavelengths that are not absorbed by ions in the photosphere come from deep within the photosphere where it is hotter, and travel straight through unimpeded. Photons of the right energy to be absorbed by a gas present in the photosphere, say hydrogen seeing as you have mentioned h-alpha, have a high probability of being absorbed by an atom on the way through the photosphere, and then being re-emitted in a random direction (including back down!) Photons that have a high probability of being absorbed and re-emitted are therefore more likely to be coming from the top of the photosphere, or the lower chromosphere, where it happens to be cooler. (During the travel from the lower to upper photosphere, they will have been absorbed and re-emitted). According to the Stephan-Boltzmann Law for black bodies, the energy radiated per unit of surface area is related to the temperature of the black body. A black body that is cooler will be less bright than a black body that is hotter. So when photons are radiated from a cooler part of the photosphere, they will appear as dips in the spectrum.
