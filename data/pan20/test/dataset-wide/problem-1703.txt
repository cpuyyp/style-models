A couple of things that you can try with Group Policy are the following: -Set up a fake proxy, and add the internal servers URLS in the "Bypass Proxy Server for Local Addresses" list. This can be easily circunvent if your users manage to install another browser that is not affected by group policies. -You can add a bogus route to 0.0.0.0, and then appropiate routes for all your internal subnets. You can achieve this using Group policy preferences and adding to the registry the list of routes under or by adding a logon script with the apropiate commands. You can also enforce a fake DNS server and distribute a custom hosts file with the required servers from a network share, however, this may be become hard to manage in the long term. 

The delegation tab is used to allow users to manage group policies (Create group policies, edit them, link them to OUs or enforce them). That tab is not useful to define which user is going to be actually affected by the policy In order to make the policies effective, you must add the groups to which you want to apply the policies in the Security Filtering tab. This Technet article may help you: Security filtering using GPMC 

The iptables rule is fine, but according to nmap's output I don't think that you have any service running in that port. Confirm that by running the following command: 

Good. So it also works for single line cases! Does it work well if the string searched is NOT in the input? Let's try it for (that does NOT exist in the given example): 

I have just checked a Windows Server 2003 computer with disks formatted in NTFS and indeed there is a "RECYCLER" hidden directory / folder in C:\ and, under that "RECYCLER" directory, there are several (also) hidden sub-directories with names started by "S-" I hope this helps. 

(note that the commit switch to sign off is lowercase "-s" and NOT uppercase "-S", as you typed in your question). After having done this, you can start doing your commits using your newly created "c" alias. Here's an example of creating and commiting a file called "test.txt" that will be signed off by the committer: 

Maybe you can do the following: have one open "Command Prompt" window where you run the "ftp command" and have another "Command Prompt" window where you run the query. I hope this helps. 

If I understand the question correctly, you want the "www" group to have 'read', 'write' and 'execute' privileges on the "/opt/apps" folder (directory) and subdirectories. In that case, use the command like this: 

Imagining your input is saved in a file called "test.txt", you can use "awk" with the following syntax: 

My question is the following: is there a way to see the RAID events history / log of the RAID internal controller (a "Smart Array P400")? I would like to be able to use "hpacucli" for that, but I can't find any related command in the Hpacucli Utility for Linux - All Commands Guide I may try to use other tools for this, if required (but not HP iLO - "Integrated Lights-Out" because I don't have that access), preferably avoiding any reboot. I have checked "/var/log/messages" but I haven't found any seemingly related entries there. 

According to this answer to the same question on the devkit mailing list used by upower, newer versions no longer emit that signal since this handled by systemd. The replacement in systemd-land is logind, which has a signal called PrepareForSleep: "The PrepareForShutdown() resp. PrepareForSleep() signals are sent right before (with the argument True) and after (with the argument False) the system goes down for reboot/poweroff, resp. suspend/hibernate." Here is a simple python script for watching suspend / resume events: 

If advanced routing is a bit difficult for you then I would not recommend this approach. The problem is that by default each dhcp lease will claim the default route and also update the list of dns servers. Then there is the firewall issue: how to detect when the it is down, etc Buying a cheap and easy to configure router might just be better for you. 

Probably a silly question, but have you verified that the is also sufficiently high? 4000MB/s would be blindingly fast, that must be the cached speed not the actual disk speed. 

I have to say that this list here is helpful, if a bit confusing: it includes low level protocols (like NX, VNC, and now xpra) as well as high level wrappers (like neatx, freenx, and now winswitch). Also it points to some VNC implementations, but not the more recent TigerVNC fork... 

When I have had errors like yours they were normally fixed by replacing the drives (even though smart did not report errors - it's not always 100% accurate and I prefer to be safe). However, since this is a recurrent problem, you should consider the possibility that it is the cables (already changed so probably not) or the controller (try to add a PCI/PCIe controller and see if that helps?). Maybe upgrading the OS kernel would help too if interrupts get lost because of buggy chipset support. 

Great. So this seems to be working in several cases (although I guess there may be more efficient solutions). So, how does this work? Here's the basic rundown for the "VAR_3" example... The first part - - returns the following output: 

You can use the "split archive" functionality of "zip" itself using the "--split-size" option. From "zip" manpage (""): 

I'm not really a user of Acronis Backup 12, but the following quote from Vasily Semyonov (Acronis Virtualization Program Manager) in the Acronis Forum seems to confirm that product version doesn't have a "classic" traditional GUI anymore, but only a web interface / web console (the bold emphasis is mine): $URL$ 

The "" is for applying the sed command to the first line... And we want to NOT include that last line, so we pipe that output to the "head" command with the "" ("MINUS n") switch - specifically "" to exclude the last line: 

Raymond Chen, from Microsoft, has written the following "blog post": Why does the Recycle Bin have different file system names on FAT and NTFS? $URL$ From that blog post, let me quote the section that seems to be more relevant to this effect: 

You can see that the commit has the "Signed-off-by:" line if you run the "git log" command with the option: 

Here's a basic explanation of this awk command: : defines "|" (pipe symbol) as the field separator : only matches lines that start with "VAR_3" : prints the second field / column (that, in this case, contains the value that you want to print) UPDATE (Dec 3, 2015): So, the OP has added a clarifying comment, which leads to conclude that he wants the search to be multiline, considering the lines between two "tokens" as part of the value of the first token. Here's a revised version for the initial example, this time using the "sed" (2 times!) and "head" commands: 

Short answer is that you cannot do this with VNC. Each TCP port will be bound to a unique session. As far as I am aware you will have the same conundrum with Xpra, VNC, NX, etc. (going via a server, like freenx, and connecting via ssh is a workaround but not an ideal one!) You may be able to workaround this by writing a simple load-balancer type of application, but this will still require one port per client. As for the rest of your question: the dimensions are specified with -screen. For just starting Xvnc with these options, something like this should work: 

You may want to look at Virtual GL Quote: "VirtualGL is an open source package which gives any Unix or Linux remote display software the ability to run OpenGL applications with full 3D hardware acceleration" 

The Xvnc session and application startup: I would place all this in a script and start it from xinet.d The tricky part is to prevent users from re-connecting to an existing session. This is a unusual requirement since that is one fundamental feature of VNC. You may be able to get away with parsing the output of the Xvnc process and killing it (with the app) when you see a disconnection event. For killing the Xvnc when the app terminates, just wait for the appication to terminate in your script and kill Xvnc if it is still running at that point. 

To sign automatically all future git commits, you can define a global alias. For example, to create a global alias called "c", you would do this: 

First of all, I knew about WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation - but I must admit I did NOT know about WMIC - WMI Command-Line :) I have found the following blog post that I think helps here: Rich's Blog - Get Process CPU Usage Using WMI $URL$ In that blog post, the author uses the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process class to get the CPU usage of a process (in several ways). For instance, if the name of the running process is "iexplore" (Internet Explorer) then you would run: 

In a rack-mounted HP ProLiant DL380 G5 server, running Linux (RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - version 5.9, 64-bit): after a shutdown and power on, one of 4 hard disks of a Logical Drive using "RAID 1+0" started "Rebuilding". I was able to check the status using hpacucli ("HP Array Configuration Utility CLI") After a few hours, the rebuild was completed successfully (the previously defective hard drive was "physicaldrive 2I:1:2"): 

So, to create a split zip archive, you could do the following (the "" is the "recursive" switch to include subdirectories of the directory): 

The IBM website has several articles about installing Linux in the "IBM System x3850 M2" model, specifically about installing RHEL 5 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5), RHEL 6, SLES 10 SP2 (Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 2) and SLES 11. So, I guess that those Linux distributions, at least, are (or were) supported by IBM for that particular model. The articles are the following: IBM Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (Type 7233, 7234) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP 2 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7233) and System x3950 M2 (7233) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Regarding the keybind combinations to start the installation, it seems you may find them in the section 4 of the articles above. Let me quote here the "4.0 Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6" section from $URL$
