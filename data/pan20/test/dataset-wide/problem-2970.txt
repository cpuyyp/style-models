It isn't universal, though like you point out it seems it must be. For example, we can say that given two objects, all of whose properties are the same, we can say that they are similar and not the same. In Leibnizs language they are indiscernible. This point of view is used in modern algebra, where the technical notion is called isomorphism. And it's taken as a basic principle in Category Theory, where one 'ought' not to say that two objects are the same, but isomorphic. This might be seen as a hair-splitting distinction; and it is, but it turns out to be a useful one. 

Consider the surface of the sea; we see waves travelling across the surface of the sea and break on the beach. We can certainly have the sea without the waves; but can we have the waves without the sea - it doesn't look like it. The sea is the medium by which the waves travel. Now, one might be agnostic about the existence of the EM field, or of EM waves; but if one is committed to the existence of EM waves as a description of light; then one ought to be also committed to the existence of the EM field - the two concepts hang together in this way. note It's worth noting that one can concieve of space as the medium of motion of particles; for from Aristotles Physics, if there is no place then from where does a particle move and to where? This is a line of thought that began with Parmenides and Zeno; and which is rendered more explicitly in Descartes Meteorology; and also note the connection with the above: 

Spinoza, have a conception of Unity, still did not take the world of thought and extension to be the same, but differing modes of something other. And adopting too a principle of plenitude, argued where there is two which cannot be reduced to one; there must be more and in fact, an infinite number not discernible to us - ever and in principle. 

Without context it's difficult to make out exactly what N means by this. It's certainly not true that there are no facts, and that all there is are interpretations. The science of interpretation of texts is called hermeneutics; it's broadly applied in the Humanities: law, history & philosophy; not every interpretation is equally valid, and there are different interpretative strategies - the literal & the analogical, for example. The positive sciences, such as physics or biology establish facts: it's certainly is a fact that the speed of light is c. 

And thus the limits of the world cannot change. Yet Wittgenstein says the world can 'wax & wane' and that the 'world of the happy man is different from the unhappy'. 

A field being without gaps; should be subject to Parmenides argument: thus it should not move and be rigid; this on the face of it, seems quite surpising. But consider that a point of field, iin the usual sense, is contiguous with others - its neighbourhood; when the field has altered and we examine the same point; we see that it has the same neighbourhood - ie the principle of continuity. This is of course very different from an electron concieved as a particle which when moved now occupies a different place or neighbourhood. So, in this sense of motion, a field does as Parmenides point out, shows no motion - it is rigid; however this doesn't mean that it can't exhibit change which is a related notion - but how? 

If Paz was writing now, it would be a complacent virtual or visual exercise, rather than a literary one. 

Interesting question, particularly the passage which you're asked to parse. A) Your 3) is slightly inaccurate, in the passage al-Kindi actually says that the 'image ... would have to shrink'; whereas what you write implies the mountain itself shrinks - this is most likely an error of omission. B) The following is the crux of the argument: 

To place this in context, this was after the horrors of the first World War and before the second; an era when nationalisms were inflamed. He goes onto say: 

In Arabic, there is the term falsafa that's actually derived from the Greek philosophy; haqiqa, which isn't and is closer to essence; there's hikmet in Persian meaning wisdom, and ma'arifa which is mystical truth. 

Individual elements of culture must be placed within a System/Structure. The individual elements of culture must be understood by their inter-relationships within this System, and not by their individual identity, that is their identity is supressed. 

The bigger problem for utilitarianism (though not in this scenario) is that it fudges the detail of maximisation. In mathematics, one cannot maximise two different functions of the independent variables at the same time without also specifying an acceptable trade-off between them. For instance, "Greatness of view" (perhaps measured by straw polls of observers) and "% of time free from rain" are functions of X and Y co-ordinates on a tourist map, when averaged over the long term. One cannot maximise both at once, because the "awesome view" and "dryness" functions will each have their own local maxima and minima (hills and valleys) which in general will be in different places. So to talk of "the greatest good for the greatest number" (Bentham), trying to maximise both "good" and "number" with no specified trade-off, is a total fudge. There may be an action which is spectacularly good for 30% of the people, pretty good for 60%, OK for 80% and utterly rotten for the remaining 20%. Another action may be spectacularly good for nobody, very good for 55%, good for 75%, acceptable for 90%, bad for 5% and very bad for 5%. Which is the better course under Bentham? There is no way to determine the answer - the Bentham formulation is conceptually flawed. Consider the third action of a decree "Everyone whose name begins with a vowel shall donate all they own into a pot that will be redistributed to those who begin with a consonant". Most people are winners here. Tough on the minority - but who cares about them, they're not "the greatest number". Mrs Thatcher succeeded in successive elections because she constructed a solid, successful "coalition of the contented" covering around 40%-45% of the population who did pretty well under her (a few very richly so), and that was enough to enable the formation of guaranteed majorities under the first past the post system. But her policies were perceived as calamitous for an equal or somewhat greater number of people (whose candidates to vote for were split into two substantial and competing camps). She was hated as much (or more) as she was adored in the polarised society that her policies created. As with statistical significance, all we can do under a utilitarian ethic is specify the number we are trying to satisfy (eg 95%) and maximise the good of that chosen group. I would also argue it is better to minimise the distress of the worst-off 95%, not to maximise the pleasure of the best-off 95%: not the same thing at all (the two groups differ, as do their outcomes). But why 95%? Why not 90%, or 50%, or one of the Lanchester values for oligipolies? Utilitarianism is a total fudge if it does not address the measurement question. There is a pretence of serving the greatest possible good with no real attempt actually to do so. Johnny B 

Kant uses his theory of consciousness to buttress Aristotles theory of categories; for example early on his Critique of Pure Reason he states that Space & Time are (categories) in the mind because they are the very conditions by which we experience. These categories are thus phenomenological (the name of which explicitly displays both the subjective character of say space as phenomena, and its objective character as theorised by Physics as logical). The introduction of mathematics into the human sciences tends to be a minority position; for example Lacan introduces topology into psychology; had he been simply known for only this it seems safe to say that there would be no such field as Lacanian psychology; his importance lay in the re-invigoration of Freudian psychology by the introduction of the Mirror Stage; one might say, on the basis of intellectual history, that the same may go for the explicit introduction of category theory into the theory of consciousness. 

To be clear, the strange effects of QM occur at the atomic level; they're not visible at the macroscopic level, though they have effects there too. So, in a sense, you have Schrodinger dead to rights; no such experiment, in principle can be carried out; and hence, it appears that his line of argument is false. But hold; first, Schrodinger was writing for the public and not his peers - so he wanted to make the physics explicable; second, he wanted to emphasise the strangeness and novelty; and thirdly that the onset or must be taken into account. So, no; it's not word-play; but in a way it is; but it's a play not intending to obfuscate but to make clear: would you rather be faced with Schrodingers Equation or his eponymous Cat? 

'Who guards the guardians' is a phrase lifted from the satirical poet Juvenal Satires, (and not as I thought from Plato). The context here is marital infidelity, but Juvenal being a (satirical) poet - it wouldn't take a great deal to convince me that he's talking politics too. Its often used in reference to the section of Platos Republic where he tackles the question of political corruption. Is it fair to say that in Platos Republic he answers this by relying on virtue, that is the guardians refrain from selfishness (they guard themselves from themselves) by relying on the noble lie? That is they are taught by the educators of the city to not act in their own interests, but the interests of the whole. Could one answer this by setting up two opposing sets of guardians - each watches the other. But then what stops them from acting in concert? If they do we're back to one set of guardians, except of course they've allowed themselves to have been corrupted because they're acting in concert - so the situation is worse than the original context. 

Finally, this links up with what I wrote earlier; that it loses the 'surrounding context'; that is, in this case, it loses the ambivalence suggested by 'but'. Note: I can't help but notice that the example I've chosen is a counter-example to Finks thesis - here but is acting as emphasis. 

This whilst not classical civil warfare is certainly not social cohesion; and I find disturbing. One might ask what is the proper concept to describe this. 

Is work then virtual? That is, its ostensible purpose is not its true purpose - for example we could posit Foucaults idea of a disciplinary society; that is work as a tool to discipline the body social/politic? 

I mean outside of its own discipline but also outside of the Anglo-European world. This question was provoked by the introduction to the Routledge History of Western Philosophy - Vol 10 - Continental Philosophy. They write: 

Relativity of a model and relative to an oracle are two distinct mathematical notions coming from different areas of mathematics. They're not connected. A theory can be presented in axiomatic form. One then attempts to constuct a model to show that this theory actually models something. Now one would hope that for certain theories there is a unique model. After all, one doesn't want, several models of ordinary arithmatic. For example, the Peano Axioms models arithmtic, and there is the usual standard model of arithmatic, but there are also non-standard models too. In the reference, they rely on the compactness theorem in logic to show this. A different construction uses ultraproducts, now the model produced by this method is uncountable, but by using the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem one can produce countable models. So the Lowenheim-Sklem theorem is not used directly to show that there multiple models of arithmetic. This is actually show via other means. Compoutation is modelled by the turing model (or there lambda calculus which is provably equivalent), but it cannot answer all questions. An oracle is attached which gives answers to a specific class of questions for which no mechanism or algorithm is explained. For example, the halting problem for Turing Machines in not solvable by a turing machine. One can stipulate an Oracle that does indeed answer these questions. There is a link between computation and countable non-standard models of arithmetic. This is the operations of addition & multiplication are not computable (Tennenbaums Theorem). 

The essence of mathematics is different from that of consciousness; but the above remark shows that a certain perspective brings out similarities in form that hadn't been noted uptil then. Consider - mathematics in essence is timeless; Consciousness is in time - one cannot reflect on Consciousness without also reflecting on time and in time - one thinks of Heideggers Being & Time - perhaps a better title would have been Being in Time or Time in Being; Can the two be torn apart? Considered alone? Being Alone? Time Alone? Is that not an error of abstraction? Time is an essential difference between Mathematics & Consciousness or between Mathematics & Being. (one should note that Hegels formulation has entered popular consciousness in that human beings are uniquely self-conscious, meaning conscious of the conscious-self. Heidegger refines it). 

One might suppose, if these facts were not the case; that they were other. But this doesn't seem to be right either. For although he writes that: 

This appears to be clearly related to speculations by William Clifford on space and matter. For example, in a paper read out to the Cambridge Philsophical Society in 1870 he said: 

The first question a mathematician looking at a new concept is not to ask whether it exists but how it proves itself useful. The differential calculus made it easy to write down the equation of motion of Newtonian Physics and Descartes coordinate geometry made it possible to formulate the same equations in a natural way. This might be called the pragmatic answer, in the sense we think of it as a tool to predict, describe or solve; or a coherent answer, which rejects the (metaphysical) reduction to a foundation, (philosophically this view is called foundatinalism) to a set of beliefs (axioms) that are secure or justified, and is non-inferential ie axioms. So how do sets prove themselves useful in mathematics. This is connected with Hilberts programme to reduce mathematics to logic, and one is lead to this thought when one considers that sets are aligned with logic, consider Venn Diagrams and observations that all the integers for a set and so on. A different approach, called Platonism asserts the existence of any set of axioms that is internally consistent. This draws upon Platos theory of Forms which gives existence to pure ideas. This is essentially a metaphysical supposition, and evidence of such a position can only be given in the most indirect kind of way. Another position that came out of the early work on mathematical logic is Formalism which drops any need to ground a theory in some Platonic world and instead observes that consistency is all that is important when it comes to manipulating axioms and theorems. This is actually grounded in logic, and observes that a mathematical theory can be seen as simply as a set of strings that are rewritten according to some set of rules. Finally, the analytic or positivist approach that Rostomyan mentions with regards to Carnap, and which came out of a philosophy of science in Vienna, also dispenses with metaphysics by rendering them 'meaningless' - the metaphysical voice is silenced.
