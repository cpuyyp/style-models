In the 1940's the RAND corporation put together a series of simulations about war between the USA and the USSR. In the end, they came out with a series of two "good" possibilities, degree of victory and number of crew lives saved. 

Herd Behaviour, Bubbles and Crashes (Lux (1995)) The investor is aware that it's a bubble and is overvalued, but believes he can make a profit by selling before the bubble bursts. Bubbles, rational expectations and financial markets (Blanchard and Watson (1982)) is a famous paper on this subject. 

It won't help much with the high frequency variation of interest to you but this is a famous and important paper on this topic:

Behavioral Despair in the Talmud uses similar techniques on a related class of problems. The story of King Solomon and splitting the baby (Judgment of Solomon) could be interpreted as an early example of a truthful revelation mechanism from approximately 1,000 BCE.

Perfect complements is equivalent to Leontief utility: $U(x,y) = min(x/a_x, y/a_y)$ The MRS is defined as: $MRS_x,y = MU_x / MU_y$ Since this utility function is not differentiable the concept of marginal substitution is not well defined for Derek. However, we don't need marginal arguments for Derek to solve the problem. A function doesn't have to be differentiable to have a unique maximum. Derek has Leontief preferences and so wants to consume $x_d = 2 y_d$ for all prices. He exhausts his wealth (his endowment): $4 p_x + 1 p_y = w = x_d p_x + y_d p_y$ We can use this to solve for $y_d = (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 1) and $x_d = 2 (4 p_x + 1 p_y) / (p_y + 2 p_x)$ (eqn 2). Jane has Cobb-Douglas preferences and so wants to spend constant budget shares on x: $x_j p_x / (2 p_x + 2 p_y) = 2/3$ and $y_j p_y / (2 p_x + 2p_y) = 1/3$. We can also solve these for $x_j = (2/3) / (p_x / (2 p_x + 2 p_y) )$ (eqn 3) and $y_j = (1/3) / (p_y / (2 p_x + 2p_y))$ (eqn 4). However, we also know that in equilibrium $y_j + y_d = 3$ (eqn 5) and $x_j + x_d = 6$ (eqn 6) This is 6 equations and 6 unknowns ($p_x, p_y, x_d, y_d, x_j, y_j$) and can be solved for the equilibrium prices and allocation. 

Evaluating The Two-Income Trap Hypothesis Arnold Kling (Taxes and the Two-Income Trap) notes that Zywicki's estimate doesn't include payroll taxes and therefore underestimates the change in tax burden. 

I don't have my copy here but I believe that the book A theory of moves by Steven Brams solves all possible games of the type you describe. 

I see the important lesson of the impossibility theorem as establishing that it is not generally speaking possible to have nicely behaved preferences of groups, even if individuals have nicely behaved preferences. Therefore a social welfare function may not exist . Attempts to improve aggregate welfare by maximizing the outcome of a preference aggregation mechanism may result in unfair or irrational outcomes. The impossibility theorem was supposedly a major reason for reforms in the papal election process. It also launched important research into if the issues Arrow raised were important for people's actual preferences and institutions. Interestingly, they are for the most common forms of preference aggregation (e.g., see Bush v. Gore. v. Nader or the notorious differences in seats and votes in UK elections). It also shows (along with Condorcet) that agenda control (in what order do we vote on the choices) is a powerful force for determining final outcomes. Finally, it launched research into which aggregation mechanisms were the least bad, seeming to settle on something like Single Transferable Vote or Instant Runoff mechanisms in most situations. But for a more critical overview (with which the authors disagree), see pages 14-15 of Social Choice and Legitimacy: The Possibilities of Impossibility. 

While it is possible to rigorously define a bubble in principle (see for example asset markets where prices violate transversality conditions), in practice it can be difficult or impossible to identify actual bubbles, even ex-post. For example, @dismalscience discusses looking at house-price-to-rent ratios. This sounds straightforward. If houses are selling for more than the net present value of their rents then you have a bubble. But there are many tricky bits in that analysis. Rental markets for single family homes are not robust and so it is difficult to impute accurate rents from the multi-family (apartment / townhouses) market that makes up most of the market. Long term residential leases at market prices are essentially non-existent so future rents are at best an educated guess. And what rate shall we discount the rents at? Discounting and Intergenerational Equity (1999) by Portney and Weyant makes the case for using everything between a discount rate of 0 and stock market returns. Trachtenberg (2011) argues that the proper discount rate for a social planner may even be negative. With all of this uncertainty and estimation error, estimates will differ. The paper Reasonable People Did Disagree: Optimism and Pessimism About the U.S. Housing Market Before the Crash (Gerardi, Foote, and Willen (2010)) shows how different scholars used price-to-rent / user-cost approaches to come to very different conclusions on if housing was over-valued. 

Like many questions in economics, optimal behavior depends on the set of alternatives. The alternatives of Panama, El Salvador, and Ecuador to dollarization are likely a heavily politicized monetary and exchange rate policy. And so for the hypothetical small open economy considered in the question, the key issue is "What's the institutional effectiveness and independence of the potential monetary authority?" There are small, open economies with well run central banks (Australia and Switzerland) but also less well run ones (Turkey). If Panama could have Australia's quality of central bank they'd probably prefer that to dollarization. That might explain why Chile and Costa Rica, with some of the best institutions in Central America choose not to peg their currency to the dollar. If Panama did manage its own monetary affairs without a peg they'd get likely get results more like Turkey. They likely prefer dollarization to the results they'd expect from independent monetary policy. And indeed, when you peek into the past of many countries with pegged currencies, you often find an episode of poorly conducted monetary policy just before dollarization. Not Panama (never had its own currency since independence), nor El Salvador, but Ecuador introduced dollarization in response to a severe banking and financial crisis. Argentina also seemed to introduce dollarization in response to monetary crisis. There are of course other considerations related to optimal currency areas. In particular, if you do a lot of trade with the USA dollarization is less of a sacrifice with respect to the best possible independent currency and monetary policy then if you do most of your trade with a neighboring country that uses a different currency. If Mexico adopts a pegged currency at some point the dollar makes a lot more sense than the Euro when 70% of their trade is with the USA and trade is a big part of their economy. But neighboring countries often have similar trading partners, and are in a similar position with respect to other optimal currency area criteria (no labor mobility to the reference country, no fiscal transfer mechanism shared with the reference country, and probably similar business cycles) so institutions are going to play a important role in explaining cross-sectional differences in the decision to dollarize, and that is why I highlight that in this answer. 

John Rawls, in his book, A Theory of Justice, discusses the Maxi Min Principle, where he essentially says that societies can be compared based on how well they maximize the welfare of those with the lowest welfare (subject to caveats about certain basic human rights). If the typical welfare function is a weighted average of individual welfare $U_i$ like: $$\sum a_i \cdot u_i$$ over all $i$, then this welfare function is $$\min u_i$$. Since the minimum is the 0th percentile, I think this would just barely qualify as an answer to your question. I suspect that's not exactly what you had in mind, but it might be helpful. This metric has appeared in a number of economics papers including Amartya Sen 's 1977 Econometrica paper, On Weights and Measures: Informational Constraints in Social Welfare Analysis, The Aggregation of Climate Change Damages: a Welfare Theoretic Approach (Fankhauser, Tol, and Pearce (1997)), and Optimal Redistributive Taxation When Individual Welfare Depends Upon Relative Income (Boskin and Sheshinski (1978)) One more thing: I've also seen a blog post that compares Swedish and American incomes at all income deciles and shows the level of percentiles at which a poor person would be better off in Sweden: 

This code doesn't spell out the price of the option, it just show my calculations for the paragraph above. I believe the real price of this option would actually be zero if shorting is permitted. If you buy three units of asset $S^2_0$ and short one unit of $S^1_0$ you get an asset with payouts $[ 0.4, 1.6, 0.8]$. This position costs nothing to take, has positive payouts for all states, and first order stochastically dominates the option itself. Since it is possible to make a better than replicating portfolio at zero cost the price should be zero. Oh the insanity at work when arbitrages are present! 

These data go back to 1970's for some countries, but the data only covers 1970-2013. The OECD numbers go back to 2000 but are even easier to work with. You can link right to them. For some rich countries the data go back quite a bit farther (like G7 countries like the UK, France, and the USA). For a large panel of countries. I don't know of sources better than the World Bank and the OECD. You could check the IMF data page but all I found were links back to the World Bank data. 

New Hedonic Estimates of Regional Constant Quality House Prices (Millsa and Simenauerb (1996)) Because housing is a long lived asset and it is somewhat unusual to significantly change the size of a house after it is built we could explore your question with the quantity and quality of new housing, assuming existing housing is largely unchanged. The US Census's New Residential Construction Survey has rich information about new housing. For example, on Characteristics of New Single-Family Houses Sold one can see many attributes of new houses including size, bedrooms, bathrooms, number sold, and much more. The Median and Average Square Feet of Floor Area in New Single-Family Houses Sold by Location table goes back annually to 1978. So you could compare it with RGDP per capita to get an idea of how this varies with wages. 

Firms look to their market cost of capital for determining if projects are profitable. If the discount rate goes up the cost of capital will go up too and this will mean many previously good projects will not happen. This means a poorer society and less capital to combine with your labor Why is it exactly that the discount rate when up? If discount rates go up because everyone wakes up tomorrow with different preferences then how to these preferences change the world more broadly when people discount the future more heavily and risk is more feared. Perhaps this world is dull and shallow and worse to live in. If discount rates change because the distribution of expected future shocks has changed then we haven't held much fixed and you are likely worse off from the larger shocks. What do firms do to their capital structure in response these changes besides hold less capital? Do they pay out more dividends (great, who cares what others think when you get the cash) or less (terrible, now you are more dependent on the reselling your shares to recoup your investment). Why are you exempt? What's special about you and are there any other consequences of these differences? 

These two papers seem relevant. The large Indian wage premium for English language fluency suggests that there would be significant returns at the margin to providing services through trade instead of locally, but they are limited by the supply of foreigners with the right language skills. However, these premiums are largest among the skilled workers, suggesting that the benefits of a universal language would also accrue disproportionately (in absolute wage premia) to the most skilled. 

The empirical distribution of nominal rigidities could form a basis for an optimal inflation. There are other benefits and costs of inflation, but as @FooBar points out, many may be difficult to get good identification upon. The somewhat confusingly titled paper The Costs and Benefits of Going from Low Inflation to Price Stability which actually considers going from 4 percent to 2 percent annual CPI growth. Martin Feldstein lays out four welfare costs and benefits of inflation: 

Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003) [I]s investor behaviour during bubbles well studied, and are there models explaining it? Yes, this is a huge literature with probably thousands of papers and hundreds of books written about it. Here is a technical book on the subject: Asset Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis, and Herding, These books are more historical than theoretical: Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Irrational Exuberance. 

A practical or mathematical bound? For a practical bound, people have argued that very large values of $\rho$ are impossible to reconcile with non-financial risk taking. Indeed, some values of $\rho$ may not be compatible with crossing the street. Perhaps that's a bit glib, but consider Neilson and Winter (2001) which find that CRRA utility and observed wage premia for dangerous jobs are compatible with values of $\rho$ such that $0<\rho<<1$. They then point out that if $\rho$ were very very large and the model properly specified then the dangerous job wage premium would also be large or alternatively (and implausibly) that people place a very, very low value on their own lives (like $3,000). Generally speaking, data and models implying very high values of $\rho$ like a basic equity premium setup and the relative volatility of equity returns and consumption) are often taken as signs of model miss-specification instead of alternative measures of risk preferences. While we can't talk about globally infinite risk aversion, we can consider what happens as If you take the limit $\rho\rightarrow\infty$ around a particular value of wealth $W_0$. As it goes to infinity you get a step-function utility function with $U(W) = -\infty, W < W_0$ and $U(W) = C, W \ge W_0$.

I guess there might be some purpose to this but generally this is very different than $g-r$ and probably a bad idea. It isn't the same people growing the population and growing GDP. $\Delta GDP$ is the $\Delta$ (output of the existing population) + $\Delta$ (output of the new population). When you normalize by new population, you get $\Delta$ (output per capita of the new population) plus a nuisance term of $\Delta$ (output of the existing population) / $\Delta$ population). Unless incomes drive positive population changes this term is not going to behave much at all like $g-r$. 

The Limits of Arbitrage (Andrei Shleifer and Robert W. Vishny (1997)) There are many versions online, one of them is likely ungated. 

I know there are lots of gravity models in economics that take as an input distance between countries. My understanding is distance is typically coded based on the distance between capital cities, either in $L_2$ norm or great-circle distance. Most countries are small relative to the distances between them, and so maybe it doesn't matter much how they code the center of these countries for purposes of trade. But in my application I'm looking at US states, and many states are large enough that the internal placement of the location for calculating distances between states makes a difference. Additionally, state capitals are often not the economic center of the state (Carson City, NV and Albany, NY come to mind) nor the geographic center (North Folk, CA is hours away from Sacramento, CA), so I don't know of obvious choices. Are there any standard choices I should know about here? As a resource to others here are some sample data: 

Let me answer a simpler question first. Is it possible for there to be too little orange juice in the grocery store? Definitely. Let's say that the price of OJ is set too low (\$1 per liter) and customers who arrive early in the morning buy all the OJ. Assume that those customers think buying all the OJ is a good deal and they figure they'll enjoy drinking it, but that at regular price (\$4 per liter) they'd buy much less, they wouldn't want any more at those prices, and there would be lots left on the shelves. People who arrive later in the day want some OJ at \$4 per liter. If they could find them, the early OJ buyers would happily sell them the OJ at that price and pocket the profit (that follows by the demand schedule I sketched out in the second sentence of the last paragraph). That means that there are deals to be done that would improve the allocation of OJ (there are welfare increasing, Pareto-improving, trades to be made). But the early customers and the late customers have trouble finding each other and so the OJ stays in the early shoppers' refrigerators. Just about everything I just said about OJ holds for worker labor. Surprise! If the price of labor is set below the equilibrium price then early buyers purchase an inefficient quantity. Later buyers can't find the workers they need even though the marginal value of those workers is higher than the price at which the early employers bought them. Because (or perhaps I should say if) it is less efficient to look for a job while you have a job, when unemployment is too low workers ended up employed by firms that do not employ them at their highest marginal product. If only alternative employers could be found output and welfare could be improved. In fact, using a Kaldor-Hicks mechanism it is possible to make the new employer, the old employer, and the employee all better off under such circumstances. Thus it is not efficient under production efficiency or welfare efficiency criteria.
