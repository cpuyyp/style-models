The legality of the question depends somewhat on the mission of the organization (and of course the country). In the US, a church is allowed to hire only adherents of their religion, so the question is valid. An organization like Regent University is part of an overall ministry and has a mission of providing Christian Education and they too are allowed to make being an evangelical Christian a job requirement (I live in the same city as Regent University and know many people who have worked there.) A Christian Bookstore might have the same exemption. Where it gets dicey is when the organization's mission is secular (Hobby Lobby comes to mind.) In theory, organizations like this should not be allowed to discriminate in hiring or in serving customers. However in recent years, these companies have been pushing the limits on this and wanting to go to court to get the exemption removed. In the end, even when the questions are illegal, you have to decide how to answer them. Or whether those questions are a deal breaker. My personal beliefs would require me to exit an interview immediately if such a question were asked because I would not work for an organization that found such behavior morally acceptable. Another person's beliefs might lead them to answer if the answer was the one they wanted and only be upset if they were in a group that might be discriminated against but recognize that the question made them uncomfortable. A third person might be very happy to find a organization that agrees with their values. Another person might lie to get the job and yet another person might simply answer the he was a Muslim or an atheist or what ever the truth was and not care if it wasn't the answer they were looking for. 

A great deal of actual work in a professional environment is this sort of boring but necessary work. I want to hire someone who understands that and who isn't going to be a cowboy coder. So yes, do the boring parts first on your chosen examples and then do them with any new project you add. 

No matter what the culture, respect translates well. Treating people as if you believe they are competent professionals tends to make things easier. This is a problem in human psychology more than it is a cross cultural problem. All professionals should know these things happen and they are not entirely the decision of one person. If you have built a rapport, then continue doing what you are doing and just add what I am discussing below. Part of respect though also includes being honest and dealing with problems in the open. In your case, it will be obvious people got fired or laid off. It is the elephant in the room. Some of those people may be friends of the ones remaining. Going on pretending everything is the same tends to backfire in my experience. People will be stressed and worried about their own positions. I would suggest meeting with the remaining team as soon as possible after the other people are gone and telling them what happened and why (no personal details of course, you don't need to put people down). If you can possibly arrange to go to their country to have the meeting in person, that would likely be very helpful. It shows respect, it gives you a chance to get to know each other on a more personal level, and it makes it easier to judge reactions on both parts. (and if there are still some performance problems you need to address, it is great way to train people in how you want them to work) This would very probably be the best money you spend on the contract with returns that far outweigh the costs. The company I work for spends the money to send people both directions and it is the most critical element in making the onshore/offshore relationship work. If you can't afford to go, then at least try to set up a meeting over Skype (or something similar) where people can see each other. Then tell them why they were retained and ask them for help in moving forward. If you are going to be hiring replacements, ask for recommendations. Make it clear what performance level they need to reach or maintain to keep their jobs under the new conditions. Talk about how the workload needs to shift to accommodate the change. Ask them how they feel and what they need right then. What you are trying to do with this meeting is first make them feel more secure in their own jobs and second allow them to voice their fears and thoughts and be heard (this is the respect part). Be prepared for a loss of productivity. This is 100% normal when there is a layoff and it cannot be avoided. Frightened people simply do not produce as much. 

OK first, your first problem is that you let the behavior pass without commenting. It is your job to make sure your employees are doing their jobs and spending half their time prepping for interviews isn't doing their jobs. Your next problem is that if the others are spending half their time helping him get ready for interviews, they no longer care about their jobs either. You are probably about to lose your whole team. You need to address this directly ASAP. Find out why they are unhappy and be ready to find out that the reason is you. It is a huge flag when your best employee starts behaving this way. People don't openly do this stuff if they have any respect for their manager. It is blantently and "in your face" disrespectful. Was he passed over for the promotion you got? Do they have no trust in your judgement? Do they dislike your management style? Did something in the company recently change? When you talk to them about this, the worst thing you can do is be defensive or angry. Let them say their piece and then go think hard about what they said and what you can do to mitigate this situation. And don't just talk to the one who is openly interviewing, the others who are helping him prep on work time are just as in the wrong and are probably just as unhappy. You need to talk about the reason for the behavior but you also need to make it clear that the behavior will not be tolerated. It is inappropriate in every workplace to spend half your time on non-company business. That is theft. If they want to look for other jobs, you can't stop that, but you have a fiduciary obligation to the company to stop them from stealing company time. Talk to HR about what steps to take. As a manager, HR is there to help you negotiate things like this. You might also talk to HR about starting the process to hire new people as you are going to need them soon one way or the other unless you can turn this around. 

People are resistant to change. You have to get them on board with the change by listening to their concerns and answering their questions. You get them on board by having them involved in the change process and by giving them some of what they want to get some of what you want. You also need to think carefully before making a big issue of anything. You want to make sure that the things you strongly push are critical to the success of the project and not get bogged down in less important items. All software has rough edges and places where it could be better. We can't polish all of them, there is not time. So make sure you build a reputation for identifying the critical fixes and helping coach people as to why they are critical and how to avoid them in the future. Coach people by showing them the issue, describing why it is a problem and what the impact is and getting them to suggest the fix and actually create the fix. It is critical, if you want these people to get better that you do not do the fixes. If you simply rewrite everything you disagree with, all of the rest of the team will dislike working with you and you will get less and less cooperation and they will make less and less effort because they feel you will make arbitrary changes no matter what they do. They feel the changes are arbitrary because you haven't convinced them that they are not.. As to your specific problem, they probably resisted deleting the code because they were not sure what it might impact. If your team doesn't have good regression testing, then they may be right to be concerned when someone wants to delete anything. I know you tried to show them there was no impact, but did you just hit one screen or do a complete regression test? It may seem irrational, but people are especially reluctant to change code when they don't understand why it was there in the first place. This is in part because most of us have had unhappy experiences with people making changes and breaking stuff that used to work (or appear to work). Another thing to remember is that you are never going to get all the things you suggest approved. Everybody wins some and loses some. You need to learn to lose graciously. This is especially true when the issue is something that is currently causing little or no harm. If you give in graciously to what they want at times, then they are more likely to give you what you are suggesting when it is really important that they do so. You have to build up a backlog of these sorts of things, so that people will think, "Hey ChrisC is usually fair and accomodating, if he is really concerned about this issue then it must be important." That is part of how you win the big ones - by being gracious about the smaller ones. One thing you need to watch is your attitude towards others. You describe your co-workers as not totally clueless and your write up appears to insist that you are somehow better than they are. People will push back on arrogant people who think they are better than everyone else. This is an attitude you need to lose and lose quickly. Everyone in a workplace has something to contribute and everyone is better at some things and worse at others. Never think or act as if you are the fount of all knowledge and so much better than anyone else. One thing I do is try to build up the confidence of those who need coaching. I also laugh at myself and tell stories about mistakes I made in the past, so that they know I got here by making mistakes and that you can recover from mistakes. It also makes them realize I don't think they are stupid because they didn't know something. There was a time when I didn't know it either. Another good technique is to catch people doing things right and praise that. If they know that you praise as well as criticize, they will take the criticism better. 

You have to keep up a certain level of grades or you won't graduate. As to how different employers look at grades vice projects, must prefer to have both. And the projects should be significant not just the slightly harder than "Hello world". In terms of which they will consider most important for a particular job that depends highly on the requirements of the job. I am going to be looking for a different skill set if the job is to create a new database engine than if it is to program embedded systems or build a generic website. Some of these jobs require more in depth theoretical knowledge than others and thus the grades are more important. Others are looking for people who can quickly punch out project without the need for more than basic knowledge. They are going to care less about grades and more about projects. It also depends on the culture of the company and the personality/background of the hiring official. A manager who did not have a lot of formal education may think projects are more critical, a manager with a PhD is likely to go in the opposite direction. A company that has a choice of top talent from the best schools is going to be pickier about both projects and grades than a company that is not as good to work for. When you have 1000 applicants and 2 positions, you can afford to be picky. So the best way to be in consideration for the most jobs is to get good grades and do significant project work. The best way to do this is frankly to concentrate on grades during the semester and work on the projects during the school breaks. And during your breaks, work on small to major projects that need the kind of thing you just learned about in the previous semester to solidify the knowledge. And work on something fairly major that uses tools, languages or techniques you are not going to cover in your classwork but which are important in the type of job you want to get after school. Focus of the projects is important. A game project is more important to me if I am hiring for a developer to create games, a phone app is more critical if I am hiring for a position that will be creating apps, etc. 

Simply put, don't require clean desks. Your best employees are often the ones who don't have time for that nonsense. You will reward the mediocre if you do this and drive away the creative innovators. (No creative person I have ever known would stay for any longer than it took to get a new job if this policy was implemented. Creative people need mess to create.) It is a bad policy for a company to require clean desks at all times. A horribly bad policy. 

First check with your employer'd HR to see if you have short-term and long-term disability insurance. Also ask if they can advance you leave or ask other employees if they would be willing to share some of their leave with you (some places allow leave sharing for ill employees.) If those don't work out, then you are going to need to move it with a family member or friend. Give up your phone and your cable and any other discretionary expenses. See about putting credit card payments on hold until you are better. (Note if you do that, you will not be able to actually use the credit cards, but if you can't make the payment then you shouldn't be going further in debt.) You can also set up a GoFundMe page and see if people are willing to help you out. Also talk to your local government offices about welfare (or whatever it is called in your country) (and possibly unemployment) and there may be a way to apply for a disability although that usually takes longer than you have. Some churches have charity as well.
