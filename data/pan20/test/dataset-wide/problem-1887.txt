(These examples reflect my understanding - please feel free to comment on where I committed faux pas.) Since tips like these are really expected by the people working for you, the posted prices for hotel rooms, taxi fare, restaurant meals will usually be based on the expectation that people will be tipped. So a hotel room in the US will be a bit cheaper than the same room in Europe, all else being equal. If you are working and living in Switzerland and get sent to the US, you will suddenly be spending much more money on tips, even if you don't eat more at restaurants than at home. It seems unfair to me to leave your employee with this added expense. My recommendation would therefore be to factor tips into expenses and reimburse your people for them. However, a case could be made for including them in per diems - which should of course also reflect which country people are sent to. 

To add to the other excellent answers here: Keep the longer term in mind. If you have been working on this exclusively for three years, then this project is your number one reference for later clients. Suppose this project fails in a grandiose manner, as you seem to be sure it will. 

Your top three items may differ (perhaps you want people to wipe the whiteboard, or something else). However, people won't take more than three items seriously. 

The world is smaller than you think, and I would not be so sure people don't talk. HR people know each other. Sometimes HR people even talk to non-HR people. It's been heard of. Neither would I be so sure I'll never join a company I just lied to. "Never" is a long time. Nor that I will never meet the specific person I just lied to again, perhaps at another company. HR people move around, too. Did I mention that the world is smaller than you think? As to negative consequences: 

This should really depend on the country - not so much of your company, but the country the employee travels to. 

Employers in Germans will usually rather think in yearly than in monthly salaries, but let's stick with your monthly figures. A raise from 3400 to 4000 EUR per month is a 18% raise, one from 4000 to 5000 EUR is a 25% raise. Overall, you are aiming for a 47% raise over two years. This is... ambitious. Since you are at the beginning of your career, you may indeed get a higher percentage raise than later on, but a raise of 47% over two years really looks unrealistic to me. I'd rather expect something in the ball park of 300 EUR in both years, which would translate into 9% in the first and 8% in the second year. Compare this to the current almost-negative rate of inflation, and it's still a lot. Yes, a lot of that will be eaten up by taxes. Then again, if you profited from a free university education that those taxes paid for, you at least don't have a crippling college debt. You might be able to command more, of course, if you prove indispensable to your job. Or if you switch jobs. (But job tenure is usually longer in Germany than in the US, so someone who switches after only one year might be perceived as a quitter.) 

Of course, this only makes sense if you trust the cash flow problems to be temporary and the company to make a profit some day. It you don't have that level of trust any more, I would suggest cutting your losses. If you decide to cut your losses, be professional about it. You will likely meet your current boss and colleagues again. Then again, I don't think they will bear a grudge against you if you explain that you simply can't keep working without getting paid. 

Alternatively, think about possibly reducing your time spent on this project so you can take on alternative projects in parallel, as better springboards into the future. 

All of these will start to build proof that you indeed know about software development and/or coding. However, none of these will get you past the HR person who discards your application simply because you have no university degree. (Let's be honest: there are usually many applicants who do have that degree, so such a first filter is an easy one for the HR person trying to pare a pile of 100 applications down to 10. Unless you stand out from the crowd in some other way.) So you may need to find a way to bypass HR and directly reach the technical person who actually wants to hire you. Therefore, you'll need to network heavily. Where other people can use their degree, you will need to leverage personal contacts even more heavily. And in fact, the first two bullet points above are already pretty good starting points to build up your network. In addition, look for networking events in your (geographical or functional) area where you can actually meet people in person. Prepare an elevator pitch for those events. 

Go to the deciders and ask them why the decision was made this way. Explain that you probably don't see the big picture, given that the decision went against your recommendation, but that you'd like to understand better. Be friendly and polite about this. If it turns out during this conversation that people simply didn't understand your point, then politely explain this and offer to clear up any remaining points. If the issue is a lack of resources at this point, then put this change on your product backlog, and periodically bring it up. Without nagging, of course. You'll need to judge the best time to revisit this issue. If the issue is that the correction is too expensive or high risk (my first and third bullet point above), then you likely won't be able to do much. Consider leaving this issue alone, or try to devise a cheaper or lower risk way of addressing the problem. 

Putting up a hidden camera could be illegal and get you into deep, deep legal trouble. I am almost positive that this would be the case in Germany. Any recordings may not be admissible in a court of law against the thieves. If you sack someone because of such a recording, you could be sued for wrongful termination. Ask a lawyer first! 

If you have already accepted the offer from your new employer and signed the contract, then you can be honest with your current boss, tell him you will be leaving the company and thank him for his offer. The potential drawback is, of course, that he might sabotage you by not signing the paperwork for the bank. You will need to figure out whether you believe he would stoop to this. Then again, if he is so happy with you that he would gift you a car, it sounds like he would not quite sink so low. If you haven't already signed the new contract, you should of course not be shopping for a new car - especially one that requires a loan. 

All these place a constant demand on each employee's time, whether he works 20h per week, 40h or 60h. Suppose these things consume 4h per week, and that's a very conservative estimate. 4h are 20% of a 20h/week employee, but only 10% of a 40h/week employee. Put otherwise, two 20h/week employees only yield 2*16=32h total productive time, whereas one 40h/week employee yields 36h, or 12.5% more. (If you believe a 12.5% differential in productivity is no big deal, try negotiating for a 12.5% pay raise without a compelling reason.) Part-timing is certainly possible, even in very large German software companies. But it will almost always involve people who have been with the company for quite some time and who already have a lot of specialized knowledge. For a beginner, part-timing would first of all mean that he will take six months instead of three to learn the ropes. 

Now, as written above, this should be taken with a huge grain of salt. I am not a psychotherapist (though I work with them and have learned a thing or two), and anyway, nobody can diagnose a disorder over the internet - using hearsay about the symptoms, to boot. I am posting this for two reasons: 

I'd recommend something open-ended: "How do people learn around here?" Then wait and see whether they mention a training budget (in terms of money or x% of your time), sending people to conferences, or a library, or one of your interviewers spontaneously telling about a training he just attended or a book he just read. Or take a "commitment to learning" as given and ask your interviewer directly about his or her last learning experience. Was it classroom, virtual, textbook? How did he hear about it? How was it approved? Was it internal or external? How typical was his experience? Or just ask how someone with your job description would typically spend his day and see whether they naturally mention learning. If they don't, well... you can always ask whether they just forgot it. Plus, ask to walk around in your prospective office and keep your eyes open. Any textbooks lying around? Conference posters? Anything else learning-related? 

In Switzerland, where I work, if I have an accident at work or on my way home, my workplace accident insurance will be voided if I did not take the required breaks. In this situation, I could sue my employer with a very good chance of success, claiming that I "could" not take the break because of the pressure at work. Employers very understandably do not like this, so my employer requires that I take my breaks. Here the owner of a medium-sized business explains the situation in California: 

Your employer will expect you to add value as soon as possible. At first, this may be restricted to reviewing documents written by more experienced colleagues, or writing code in a pair programming environment. There is really little we here can say about this. Keep the magic words "as soon as possible" in mind, actively look for issues where you can be productive, and you'll be fine. People are very rarely fired during the probation period in Germany. As long as you arrive on time, behave professionally, don't start harassing your colleagues and exhibit at least some minimal learning, you should be fine. Remember: firing someone during the probation period really means that someone made an error during the interview process. Nobody likes to admit that except for the most blatant cases. As to work ethic, you should really exhibit the same work ethic during the probation period as afterwards - don't slack off after six months. Start negotiating once you have an indication of the package. If you know what they are going to pay you (and what the perks are), start the negotiation. Don't wait for the paperwork. Redoing that is a hassle that nobody wants to do. Don't negotiate after having signed. After signing, the first point for negotiations is after your first review. However, don't expect much to come from negotiating in your current position - it doesn't sound like you bring a lot of special knowledge to the table, and at the beginning of your career, your employer will likely have some pretty rigid guidelines for your package. Nevertheless, some negotiating (maybe not so much over salary, but rather over some additional training budget?) won't hurt.
