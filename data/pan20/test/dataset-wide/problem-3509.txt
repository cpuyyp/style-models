The American Economic Association's Journal of Economic Perspectives can be accessed free of charge. It is definitely a reputable outlet (articles are mainly solicited from top economists), although it tends to publish original syntheses rather than primary research. 

It is light on technical details, and heavy on intuition. This might not appeal to you if you are a math major, but it's the most important thing to get straight if you are interested in applying the empirical methods rather than developing new econometric methods. Stock and Watson is very basic, so you will probably want to supplement it. Good choices are likely to be 

We start with a production function: $f(k,l)$, which tells us what quantity will be produced if we use $k$ units of capital and $l$ units of labour. Suppose that we cange that quantity of capital by $dk$ units and change the quantity of labour by $dl$ units. If this change is chosen so that we stay on the same isoquant then it must be that the total production doesn't change: $$\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial k}dk+\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial l}dl=0.$$ Rearranging, we get $$\frac{dk}{dl}=-\frac{\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial l}}{\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial k}}.$$ This is the marginal rate of technical substitution, the slope of the isoquant. It has the same interpretation as any other slope. It means that if I increase labour by one unit then I can decrease capital by $$\frac{\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial l}}{\frac{\partial f(k,l)}{\partial k}}$$ units. 

It shows that inequality was increasing for most of the last 35 years, but has started to decrease again recently. (You can read more at the source for this figure: $URL$ Once data is weighted by population, we see a longer-term trend for decreasing inequality (due to rapid growth in China and India, which contain around a third of the world's people: 

First, let's be clear what we mean by abuse of dominance: this is when a firm is a monopoly or near-monopoly, and attempts to use that position in order to perpetuate or enhance its dominance of the market at the expense of competition. So we need to know: why would a market with a monopoly perform worse than one with competition. Here are the main typical answers:

The book by Gibbons that Tobias mentions is titled "A Primer in Game Theory" in Europe. It is excellent, especially in its coverage of more advanced games of imperfect/incomplete information. But it is quite concise in its treatment of games of complete information like the ones you are studying. The book by Osborne might therefore be a better choice. Both of these books are aimed at the introductory graduate level and are therefore quite rigorous.* However, I feel compelled to say that it sounds like you are taking a first course in game theory, so I would be inclined to suggest also the book "Strategies and Games: Theory and Practice" bu Dutta. It is more verbose, but I think also provides a more gentle introduction to topics like Nash equilibrium and mixed strategies. Game theory, like much of economics is often best learnt by first obtaining a firm grasp of the intuition, and later supplementing it with sufficient rigor. 

According (the semi-strong form of) the efficient market hypothesis, the price of an asset should reflect all publicly available information about the 'fundamental value' of that asset. The reasoning is that if there is some public information that suggests the price is below the fundamental value then people will have an incentive to act on this information and buy more of the asset. This increase in demand will cause the price of the asset to rise, closing the original price-value discrepancy. This reasoning seems intuitively plausible, but significant price-corrections during the recent recession seem to suggest that markets had systematically priced in a manner inconsistent with underlying fundamentals. What academic theories (i.e. published or in working papers) have been advanced (and by whom) to explain why the efficient market hypothesis might fail? Is there much of an empirical consensus on the validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the literature? 

Neumark and Wascher have a paper that surveys recent empirical work on the effects of the minimum wage in detail. It includes a number of tables that nicely summarise the results of a large number (102!) of studies. They conclude the paper with the following remarks: 

We calculate the unit cost as $c_L=1+0.5=1.5$ and $c_H=1+0.6=1.6$. Now we plug these numbers into the formula $$n_H\geq\frac{(p-c_L) n_L}{(p-c_H)}$$ $$n_H\geq\frac{(3-1.5) 1000}{(3-1.6)}$$ $$n_H\geq\frac{1500}{(1.4)}$$ $$n_H\geq1071.42.$$ So if you sold at least 1072 units (i.e. an extra 72 units) then the change would pay for itself. 

An interest rate is the return that a lender earns on money lent to someone else. If the interest rate is higher then it makes lending money more attractive because the return is higher. In particular, if the interest rate in, say, Russia increases relative to that in the USA then American lenders will switch from lending their money in America to lending their money in Russia where the return is greater. But in order to lend money in Russia, these investors are first going to have to convert their dollars into roubles. This increased demand for roubles causes the price of the rouble (i.e. the exchange rate) to increase. 

Here's an explanation from Paul Krugman. You can read more about this in Krugman's book End This Depression Now!. 

Your question is quite broad in the sense that various forms of market failure cover a significant portion of all of microeconomics. I presume you have already looked in a general undergraduate micro book such as Varian's Intermediate Microeconmics, which provide coverage of many of these topics. More detailed coverage of market power and monopoly can be found in Church and Ware's Industrial Organization: A Strategic Approach. Discussion of market failures caused by public goods and externalities can be found in Hindriks and Myles' Intermediate Public Economics. For market failoures originating in information asymmetries, a good source might be Bolton and Dewatripont's Contract Theory. 

I will write under the assumption that $W$ is the wage paid for each unit of labour, $L$. The blue curve labelled $D$ is the demand curve which shows, for any wage, how much labour employers want to hire. That is, the blue curve shows $L=D(W)$. The reason that $L$ is taken as the dependent variable is that these kinds of figures are usually drawn for perfectly competitive markets. The defining feature of a perfectly competitive market is that the participants take the price (i.e. the wage) as given and choose the quantity to buy or sell accordingly. The red curve labelled $S1$ is a supply curve that shows, for any wage, how many units of labour are workers willing to supply: $L=S(W)$. The hypothesis of the perfectly competitive model is that an equilibrium will arise where the quantity that workers supply and the quantity that employers demand are equal. This happens where the supply and demand curves cross, and thus pins down an equilibrium $W$ and $L$. If something happens to increase the supply of labour (e.g. mass immigration) then the supply curve shifts right (e.g. to S2) reflecting the fact that more $L$ is supplied at any wage. We then get a new equilibrium at the new intersection between $S$ and $D$. The prediction of the model is that this new equilibrium has a lower wage, and a higher quantity of labour employed. 

I will post the obligatory Efficient Market Hypothesis answer. This does not directly answer the question, but addresses the aparent misconception that there is some secret economist knowledge that can be used to earn money in financial markets. Suppose there were some method that would help you to earn more money on financial markets. Suppose that the method in question tells you that you should buy stocks in General Motors because the price of GM stocks will be higher next week. How will the people who trade on financial markets react to this? They will go out and buy GM shares before the price increases. But this increase in demand for GM stocks will cause the price of GM stocks to increase (via the usual laws of supply and demand) todayâ€”one week earlier than the method predicted! So the method is self-defeating. More generally, as soon as any information about the value of a financial instrument becomes public, people will buy or sell causing the price to change to reflect that information. This happens very quickly because the sums of money at stake are huge. (How quickly? Some New York trading firms have laid dedicated fibre-optic cables under the Hudson river to shave a couple of microseconds off of the time it takes to make a transaction). This simple example illustrate why it is almost impossible to use any publicly available information or method to earn above-normal returns in financial markets. In order to earn such returns, you would have to either 

It is mostly non-technical. Bernard Salanie (literally) wrote the book on contract theory. An ungated pdf of the chapter is available here. 

On the first bullet: suppose some one has to make a decision. We say that they have transitive and complete preferences if (i) they are able to rank the alternatives among which they choose from "most preferred" to "least preferred", and (ii) that ranking is internally consistent. On the second bullet: A person acts in an optimal manner given their preferences if they choose the alternative that is 'most preferred' among the set of all feasible alternatives. So are terrorists rational? As others have noted, the literal answer to the question is that we can't really (empirically) verify that terrorists are rational. This is because observing one rational decision does not rule-out the possibility that the individual concerned made an irrational decision at some point in the past (or that they will make an irrational decision in the future). The best we can manage is to look for behavior that violates the two conditions above and take observations of such violations to be evidence of irrationality. But, to address the spirit of the question: just because voluntarilly committing suicide and murder in the name of your beliefs may seem irrational in the colloquial sense does not mean that it is necessarily so. Indeed, if a person has carefully considered the alternatives available to them and decided that the option they find most attractive is to conduct a suicide attack then this behaviour is entirely consistent with rationality. Rational terrorism in context It is important to stress that there is no value judgement implicit in an eocnomist describing behaviour as rational. Just because something is rational behaviour does not mean that it is good or desirable or can be condoned. Rather, it just means that we think we have a systematic way of understanding why people might choose to behave in a certain way. Building a systematic understanding of a phenomenon is an important first step in deciding upon the best way to respond to it. 

$x_2$ and $x_3$ are perfect substitutes. Indeed, I can always take away one unit of $x_2$ and give one extra unit of $x_3$ and utility will remain exactly unchanged. This implies that the consumer will only ever buy whichever of $x_2$ or $x_3$ is cheapest. In other words, if $p_2\leq p_3$ then there is no loss in generality from setting $x_3=0$. The problem then becomes $$\max_{x_1,x_2}x_1^a x_2^{1-a}$$ subject to $$p_1 x_1+p_2 x_2=M$$ This is the standard Cobb-Douglas function you already know how to solve. This is actually quite a neat question because it forces us to think about the mechanism of what the consumer is doing when he maximises utility, rather than just mindlessly setting up the optimisation problem. 

ADDENDUM: It's still possible to calculate costâ€”and hence the efficient allocationâ€”from the monopoly price, but we need more information. In particular, the monopoly price satisfies $$\frac{p-c}{p}=-\frac{1}{\eta},$$ where $\eta$ is the price elasticity of demand and $c$ is marginal cost. Thus, to figure out marginal cost we need know the price and the elasticity, whereas in a competitive market we only needed to observe the price. 

Your reasoning is basically correct. In fact, when I teach externalities to my students, I draw something very much like your diagram 1. The textbook is confusing because the MSC and MSB curves are supposed to show the social benefits and costs of this particular activity. Taxes and subsidies can't possibly change these costs/benefits because they don't change the fundamental real effects of the activity (one unit of smoke is equally disgusting, regardless of whether it is taxed or not). The tax just means that in addition to this cost, some money is changing hands. But that's not really a social cost because the money will end up belonging to someone. 

Any standard economic model is going to predict that an oversupply of ships implies a reduction in the price of shipping, which hits the profits of shipping companies. 

I have previously contented myself with the intuition that the equilibrium is for firm 1 to take the whole market at a price 'slightly below' $c_2$? But looking at the technical details raises doubts in my mind: 

One thing I hear a lot is talk of decreasing marginal utilityâ€”the idea being that additional units of a good become progressively less attractive the more units of that good one has already. However, this always made me a little uncomfortable because of the ordinality of utility. If we take the trivial case of a world in which there is only one good with utility $u(x)$ satisfying $u'(x),\ u''(x)<0$ (decreasing marginal utility) then it is clearly possible to construct an increasing function $f$ such that $(f\circ u)$ is linear in $x$. Moreover, since utility functions are invariant to monotone-increasing transformations, $(f\circ u)$ is a utility function that represents the same preferences as $u$ (but now has constant marginal utility). Thus, in a world with a single good it seems that it never makes sense to talk about diminishing marginal utility. My question is this: consider a market with $L>1$ goods. Is there a formal condition under which we can safely talk about decreasing marginal utility? That is to say, is there a class of preferences such that every valid utility representation, $u(\mathbf{x})$, has $u_{ii}(\mathbf{x})<0$ for some $i$? Alternatively, is there some simple proof that, for $L>1$, the existence of a utility representation with $u_{ii}(\mathbf{x})<0$ for some $i$ necessarily implies that all utility representations have $u_{ii}(\mathbf{x})<0$?
