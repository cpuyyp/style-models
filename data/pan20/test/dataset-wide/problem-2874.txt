(Edit: as Niel has quite rightly pointed out, since D being true and C false would make C also true, D must be false as well, so in fact C simply has to be true, despite saying nothing more than that C is the only one of the sentences that's true!) There is nothing Paradoxical about this state of affairs. The case where exactly one of A, B, C or D are true is an absolutely consistent response; it's just that there's nothing in the world involved in the assertion. What this suggests is that there's nothing in fact involved in the content of A, B C and D in formulating this puzzle, but simply that Niel's answer above is exactly right in restricting its interest to Propositional interpretations, and that we will ultimately be interested in those propositional interpretations satisfying ¬A, ¬B, C and ¬D. 

I think I see what your tutor is getting at. The trick here is the work being done by "interpretations" in your working theory of validity. With an interpretation, we're building up a model according to which a particular statement or set of statements might be true. In formal logic we are often very mathematically precise about what sorts of things count as models (we usually need to give an account in terms of algebra or set theory), but we can usually speak informally about conceivable pictures of how things might be. Consider a conceivable model in which all birds can fly. Well, one reasonably like our own, where we have a number of bird species (pigeons, eagles etc.) capable of flight. There is another conceivable model in which all birds cannot fly - all of the possible species of bird are ones that don't fly (penguins, Ostriches etc.). This suggests one way of looking at a conceivable model in which both of those things are the case - look for the intersection of the list of species satisfying both criteria. Since the two criteria are in this case exclusive, though, the only models are those in which the set of bird species is just empty; i.e. there are no birds. In this model, it's absolutely the case that all birds can fly, and that all birds can't fly, because there aren't any birds! What this points to is a curious feature about the "interpretations" theory of validity, which demonstrates that a number of things that look like they would be deductively contradictory turn out to not necessarily be so. On the face of it, you would think that "fish can swim" and "fish cannot swim" would look like they're in logical contrast with each other. But actually, in constructing a model in which there are lots of other animals but unfortunately no fish, we demonstrate logically coherent possibilities in which both of the premises of the second argument can be deemed admissable, while the conclusion would turn out simply false. 

Definition 1 and Axiom 3 in the Wiki article together seem to have something of a Diagonalization flair to them. G(x) is defined to be a property of x such that for every positive property ɸ, ɸ(x). G is then affirmed axiomatically to itself be a positive property. This is rather similar to the argument invoked in the first incompleteness theorem that the numerical predicates representable in numerical syntax (e.g. ɸ(x)) can themselves be used to define a representable self-application sentence, . I think this might be where the similarities end, but it actually looks quite promising that the argument will eventually fall into contradiction for reasons more like the Liar paradox than the Incompleteness theorem, if it ends up reasoning that there are properties that God does not have, that he must therefore have their negations as properties and, using the necessary implication hook, that God must have an impossible property. 

It's easy to overstate the relevance of Nietzsche's pronunciation to the terms of classical Theology. When Nietzsche talks about God, he talks about God as a cornerstone of Western Culture, not God as the character of a Christian story. From section 343 of TGS, Nietzsche spells out his intended meaning: 

Questions then arise as to what the "system memberhood" relation and the "considered in" function are supposed to be. These aren't typical mathematical terms, and don't in themselves appear to carry a lot of significance, but the idea that in principle no sense could be made of them seems a bit hasty. Addition in response to comments: There is also another possibility, which might be also informative depending on how you want to read "considering in", which is that the two instances of "member" in the quote need not necessarily be the same. Let's suppose for instance that we take one such system to be the Natural Numbers. One form of "considering" a number might to take that number's predecessor and apply the successor function to it. So here we would want to say that the sentence has a slightly different logical form. Given a system S, 

This would give us () as even, though not, say, (). We still wouldn't get a state where we'd be happy calling rational odd the negation of rational even, but importantly more things would be rational even in this definition that didn't work last time. And of course you might note that this additional disjoint condition actually subsumes our original analysis, since every digit following the last digit of a number (i.e. 0 of 0) is equal to it. Maybe this is fits with what we want! Maybe it doesn't! Is a rational even? What about - should we insist that this works too, and try to find an analysis that includes it? Do we want the concept of being rational even to stand in some relation to the concept of rational odd, and if so how do we think the two concepts relate to one another? I tend to think that we only progress at this level through practical, rather than purely abstract theoretical, aspects of stress-testing. What are we interested in rational evenness for - what work is this new concept going to do for us? Maybe this sits in some particular abstract algebra context or maybe it's something interesting for computational analysis, but you'll really want a backdrop of some particular application in which to answer these kinds of questions of intuition. Otherwise the whole thing seems a bit like just spinning wheels for the sake of it! That's not to say there is no such backdrop, but rather that intuitions need to somehow be grounded in practice in order for there to be any sense of their verification - something very much needed in the lofty abstractions of mathematics! 

Is there a possible Counterpart theory way that we might make sense of this? Suppose that 7 in our world is the natural number 7, but in some other possible world, the proper counterpart of 7 is in some "Hypocomplex" field such that it has a square root. Taking a Lewisian interpretation of possibility, this would be the way to go to validate the claim that 7 is possibly not prime. The issue then would be about deciding whether there was such a possible world, and whether it would be accurate to pick out a counterpart of 7 satisfying the appropriate relational properties. There doesn't seem to be any problem in saying that there is a possible world in which there is a square root of negative 1. That's because the Complex numbers are effectively a way of describing pairs of reals, which can be done in set theory. Since it can be done in Set Theory, and the standard Kripke semantics of possible worlds is also set theoretic, what doubt can there be? So your strategy first needs a formal component; you need to give the semantics of the arithmetical language where your "quimaginary" numbers exist. That doesn't seem implausible, but you've got to do the work. Then you're going to have to make an argument to the effect that you're not equivocating when you talk about 7 in this model as a counterpart to the 7 of the standard model of arithmetic. This argument is much more likely to fail, since we tend to associate prime numbers with the study of finite arithmetic, rather than with functions over the infinitary areas of maths like complex fields. Your counterpart relation is going to have to be very complicated, to the point where you probably have to give up on uniqueness or symmetry of counterparthood. 

Others will I'm sure provide historical discussions concerning justifications for the use of logic. But personally I don't think there's any real reason to do so. If logic isn't applicable then why bother arguing? There is no normative grounds to my statement carrying any force of truth, so connecting sentence A to conclusion B is just a bit of writing with no real content behind it. Maybe you're happy to accept that conclusion. If so, cool - enjoy the aesthetics of the scribbles! 

The idea here is that you can discharge in this inference, but you need to ensure that the here is itself a permissable deductive inference from to . This would let you keep the cases like without the arbitrariness involved in the current rule. 

Firstly, it's worth drawing out the distinction between what is conceivable and what is possible. It's an open question whether it can be useful to view one as a guide to the other, so make it clear that the ability of the human mind to dream up weird and fantastic scenarios doesn't mean that what they describe is something that is in the realm of possibility. Possible worlds might well include some pretty crazy things, but in order to make the notion of what is possible clear, you need to split it apart from what people can imagine. Secondly, your example student is having a problem with taking Logic and Mathematics to be systems of paradigmatic necessary truths. This seems quite legitimate for someone new to philosophy, since public exposure to these things is generally purely formal. Some Philosophy of Language can help to unsettle some of the prior intuitions that your students might have already established. Kripke's examples in Naming and Necessity about a posteriori necessity seem to suggest that there can be many conflated notions being bundled into natural intuitions about necessity. It's necessary that Hesperus is identical to Phosphorus, because the two names are of "the same" planet, and identity is by definition reflexive. But it's not analytic or a priori that 'Hesperus', being the evening star, refers to the same thing as 'Phosphorus', the morning star. If people are thinking about logic and mathematics purely syntactically, they'll generally stick solely to the latter as their conception of necessity. You can use this as an opportunity to make the Use/Mention distinction. Then you can use some examples of descriptions with identical referents, like Water and H20, and embedding them in a particular theoretical context, in this case, molecular chemistry. 

I might be reading something into your thoughts that you're not intending, so feel free to take this with as much or as little relevance to your enquiries as you wish. It seems like something that might be a useful piece of conceptual technology for you would be the idea of Logical Intension. In analytical philosophy of language, we often draw a distinction between two senses in which a word, a naming or predicative phrase, or a sentence means something. On one hand, we might have a direct notion of reference - that is, the thing to which a name refers. So if I mention "the tree in the courtyard", to say of this phrase that it has a reference is to say that there is something in the world (or to avoid metaphysical readings, we might say in my frame of reference) such that it is a tree, and that in using that naming phrase, I might be intending to specifically ascribe properties or descriptions to that thing. Of course, not every sensible piece of language I might want to use has an obvious reference. Let's say for example that I want to talk about unicorns. Now unfortunately, there are no unicorns (as far as I'm aware; at least, there certainly aren't any unicorns in my frame of reference). But on the other hand, that doesn't mean that any instance of the phrase "unicorns are..." is without meaning. I can mention unicorns, confident that other people will understand that I mean to talk about creatures like spiral-horned horses, even in the absence of anything to function as a clear referential object of the term "this or that unicorn". This other kind of meaning of a word, a kind of indirect, descriptional notion of meaning where we associate words or phrases with some kind of psychological event, construction procedure, experimental verification or falsification scheme etc. is called intensional meaning or just the intension (or sometimes sense, in the work of Gottlob Frege who is often credited with drawing the distinction in formal analytical theory), in contrast with the "extensional meaning" that we more commonly think of as just "the stuff that we're talking about". The idea is that we draw a distinction between the domain of things that the language is used to denote or talk about and the means of presentation of the things we want to talk about that language use signifies.
