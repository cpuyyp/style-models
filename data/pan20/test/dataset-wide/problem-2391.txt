I personally don't care a hoot what religion says about sex. It has no place in my love life. You only need to look to the rampant hypocrisy within Christianity/Catholicism to realise that the ones moralising about sex don't practice what they preach. My view is enjoy it while you can but be cautious and stay as safe as possible. I've had countless casual encounters over my life and I don't regret any of them. 

I've heard it taught by various secular teachers that through mindfulness one can uncover the "true authentic self" because we realise that we are not thought but that we are awareness of thought. Please correct me if I'm mistaken but in my understanding this is not in alignment with Buddhist teachings and a misunderstanding of mindfulness. We can discover that there is an awareness of thought, emotion etc but are we this awareness? Wouldn't Buddha say that even awareness is not self? If we are not thought, not awareness, who or what is the observer? Is the observer just more impermanent phenomena? 

And the same applies to the other senses. You can find a similar discussion in the Aparihani Sutta where it talks about removing "evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress". There is a slightly different message in the Sacitta Sutta, but also teaching us to remove unskillful thoughts: 

If you read the whole of SN 26 (Uppada-samyutta), X refers to eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, thoughts, different types of consciousness, different types of contacts, different types of feelings, different types of perceptions, different types of intentions, different types of cravings, the six elements and the five aggregates. This is just restating "sabbe sankhara dukkha" (Dhammapada 278) or "all conditioned things are suffering" in a longer and more elaborate way, where X = sankhara. All these conditioned things arise (uppāda), continue (ṭhiti) and reborn (abhinibbatti). These are explained by dependent origination. A "person" or "individual" is compounded and composed of the aforementioned conditioned things. Dependent origination explains the details of how that works. The fact that they arise (uppāda), continue (ṭhiti) and are reborn (abhinibbatti), would be summarized as their manifestation (pātubhāvo). Arise here is when the conditioned things arise at birth and continue throughout the moments of life. Rebirth here indeed refers to death and break-up of the body, followed by rearising or rebirth into a new life. Altogether, these stages would represent the manifestation of these conditioned things. The very manifestation of these conditioned things are suffering. This is how it is related to "sabbe sankhara dukkha". How can I support my opinion that the word "abhinibbatti" indeed refers to "literal" rebirth here? Well, we just need to see how it is used in the other suttas: In MN 96: 

Events for the "in between being individual" are celebrated in Theravada folk-near Buddhism and daily life as well, but mostly not really made to a doctrine derived from the Buddha, by serious teachers and monks. But similar, and also popular at large, can be found as well, as it gives favors in many aspects for those willing to buy and trade for the sake of becoming. The main different between the tradition might be, that Vajrayana seems to be more devoted to the world and serve its desires and ideas, while Theravada seems to focus more on liberation it self. How ever, Buddhas Dhamma, the good teachings, serve both in it's best possible way, so actually not that much requirement to stick to much to later developed notions and to much to cultural aspects, althought they might also serve certain purposes in given circumstances. May you soon no more come into being, may your rebirth end! :-) do you like it? The Bardo-questions here, by the way, could still not be valid answered by the followers of certain sects. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Ajaan Fuang Jotiko has some relevant advice for you in the compilation "Awareness Itself" (compiled and translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu): 

How do we interpret the actions (or non-actions) of Sanghamaji? Did he lack compassion? Should he not have addressed his former wife compassionately, and given her an explanation of the Dhamma, and the path to the end of suffering? The sutta does not say if he ensured that the welfare of his wife and son is taken care of, before leaving the lay life of a householder. 

My question is: Does Mahayana Buddhism teach eternalism? If this is not the case, then what is the right interpretation of the Mahayana teachings on Arahant and the Eternal Buddha above? In the question above, when I wrote "Mahayana Buddhism", I mean particularly in the context of the Lotus Sutra and the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra. 

As far as I'm concerned you can be whatever you like. You can even create your own religion if you so desire. Orthodox Buddhists and Christians will of course disagree but frankly I don't really care. The Buddha was not Buddhist and Jesus was not Christian. They were just enlightened beings and we all have that potential. Neither of them would have planned on their teachings becoming a massive worldwide cult and I'm pretty sure that if either of them knew what abhorrent acts have been and still are being carried out in their name they would be heartbroken. So follow what works and what resonates as truth for you. If it causes you and others to suffer less and find more peace and happiness stick with it, if not then ditch it. I don't subscribe to any one religion. I believe they all have nuggets of truth within them. 

So, if you're afflicted with thoughts imbued with the three poisons (desire/ greed/ attachment, aversion/ hatred and delusion), then this is the sign of unskillful thoughts. The Buddha advises above to switch to other thoughts which are skillful (which are the opposite of the three poisons), then advises to concentrate the mind (in the context of meditation). Of course, outside of the context of meditation, one should recognize unskillful thoughts imbued with the three poisons, then switch to other themes. Concerning idleness or laziness, the Sigalovada Sutta states: 

You can try to first practise the mindfulness meditation taught by Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu, including the sitting meditation and the walking meditation. There is the text for this here and the YouTube video playlist here. After that, you can slowly incorporate it into daily life. In Chapter Six, he says: 

I read an article that included the following - "Through careful, mindful observation of this process of sensation overlaid with cognitive evaluation, it’s possible to tease apart the raw sense data from all the mental activity about it. And when you do this, you may notice that the raw physical sensations, which until now you had always assumed to be continuous, are actually absent much of the time. What’s happening is that raw sense data arise and pass away rapidly in little chunks, with gaps in between the passing away of one chunk and the arising of another. Some of those gaps can be quite long, relatively speaking, but normally you don’t notice this because all that mental processing about the sense data fills them in, giving the illusion of continuity." I have been meditating for about 6 years and attended several retreats but I still don't understand this on an experiential level. I dont think I have assumed them to be continuous. It just seems obvious to me that sensation isn't always there. I get an itch and then it's gone. I have a pain and then it's gone etc etc. maybe I'm misunderstanding this concept?? Does it mean that for example an itch that lasts for 10 seconds is not continuous for the 10 second duration? And same with a pain? Perhaps my concentration is not strong enough to ever notice this. I try to examine a sensation sometimes but an itch just seems like an itch to me. I feel I'm not making much progress,if any at all, with this stuff. I read about what is apparently supposed to happen, things you're meant to notice and experience, insights etc but my meditation just seems to be the same thing every single time. Sitting, noticing breath, thinking, noticing breath, itch, thinking, notice breath etc. It feels more and more pointless everyday. I don't seem to be learning to see the "true nature of reality" or heading toward "enlightenment" Why not? Where am I going wrong? 

It seems to be clear that Pureland practice focuses nearly exclusively on Jhana and refined becoming while teaching in regard of wisdom, incl. the explaining of Jhana and becoming seems to be merely total absent. Isn't the main aim, or general objected aim there a becoming in a refined sphere of being in the Immaterial World and joy in concentration their main focus? Of cause, my person is not really into those spheres of undertakings by the Westernland-seeker and those being, dwelling there. Maybe an answer: "No, just, merely uninstructed and not noted/know, practiced" might be proper. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

I was listening to a talk on YouTube about vipassana practice as taught by Goenka. The woman doing the talk said that the Buddha taught that every time a stimulus enters the sense door there is a sensation in the body and it is these sensations that we react to not the stimulus itself. I have tried the body scan technique quite a few times but not very successfully and so have ended practicing Mahasi Sayadaws technique instead which is focusing on the abdomen rising and falling. I have to say I'm not very aware of these sensations that are happening to every stimulus. Of course when I sit and meditate I notice some sensations such as itching, pulsing, pain etc but as far as the ones that are the result of every stimulus entering I'm not sure how I go about noticing those before I react. Also my understanding is that Buddhism also sees thought as a sense door so therefore thought also causes these sensations. Is that correct? In order to be a successful practitioner do I need to train myself to notice all these sensations? Is it good enough to just notice some like itching, trembling? Do I need to understand what causes them? Or is noticing them enough? Or do I need to notice the feeling tone associated? Or both? 

For lay followers, there is plenty of advice on achieving the short to medium term goals in the Gihi Sutta (or Discourse to the Householder), Sigalovada Sutta, Dighajanu Sutta and Anana Sutta. The minimum training rules imposed on lay followers are the five precepts. Also see this answer for the question "Can a Buddhist own and run a billion dollar business?" For those in a hurry to Nibbana, there are the more advanced training paths of anagarika (sort of a pre-monk or pre-nun), novice monk or nun, and fully ordained monk or nun. Please see this answer for details. 

There is a kind of a middle way advised above, where one should neither be too busy in too many activities, nor daydreaming or oversleeping or over-socializing. If you have idle time on your hands, you can use it for skillful activities like reading good material (like this book), or by cultivating mindfulness. In his booklet "How To Meditate", Ven. Yuttadhammo advises in "Chapter Six: Daily Life": 

Life in between, existence in between, would be existence as well, or? So to give it a special notion, this rebirth as well, does not make much sense aside of possible willing to serve the everywhere common cultural aspect of untrained people in the teachings of the Noble Ones, that there is a lasting, independent spirit, searching for new body. As Upasaka Sankha Kulathantille told in his answere, there is no mind without matter, no being without object. That counts as well for the "non"-material states, which just have mind objects instead of classical matter as object. After each death, decay, a rebirth follows, moment for moment, as well for lager appearences of aggregating, which are common taken as living being. Many existences are very short or "fail" after boming into being in a womb, so that they are regarded as having come into being at large. There might be the mystery of this distinction be found. In folk perceptions there is no difference, exept of time and traditions in detail, within different countries and cultures and can be traced in western world as well, even in modern stories and movies, my person guesses. The "living being in search for becoming" accurs also in the Pali canon, thinking on the Karaṇīya Metta-Sutta and may serve here especially to catch all possible perception a person may have in regard of existence and living.
