The modern concept of "particle" is that it has no properties except when "measured". The quantum fields that are used to calculate observational/experimental results cannot be thought of as "existing entities" in anything like a classical sense. (They vanish everywhere but at points of interactions so it makes no sense to think of them as something existing in space time just before the interaction which then vanishes when the "particle" or property is localized or somehow detected. We aren't really detecting "particles" but that is the terminology used out of habit. The concept of "matter" also is obsolete since any self respecting matter would never act like a quantum field. The word "substance" is , I suppose less restrictive, but one would have to have some observational account of it to see how it might fit into our theories. 

We say that something exists based on our ability to interact with it, experience it's effects etc. Unicorns are said to not exist (on earth) because we haven't found any and we have looked around enough that we should have found them if they were here (they're pretty big). We can't see air but we don't need to, we feel and measure it's effects Gravitational fields, magnetic fields etc basically the same. Other peoples consciousness is just inferred from behavior. Existence is just a word we use when we have certain types of experiences. Worrying about "actual" existence, if that means outside of experience in principle, can't go anywhere, there's nothing to base it on.

Why is the bolded true? To me, [1.] (belief in the line's sharpness) contradicts [2.] (disbelief of the line's importance), because if a line between science and philosophy really matters not for philosophy, then: why is there a line at all, and why did the natural sciences (and maths and other independent subjects now) separate from philosophy?

p. 239 states footnote 29 to refer to: Thomas Nagel, “Death,” in Moral Questions, 6. Why's the bold sentence true? I assume that the injured whiz prefers her intelligence. The injury bars her from pinpointing the moment of misfortune, but an objective observer (e.g. physician) can? 

They could say the words, but could never believe them because they have no beliefs. They could act like they believe the words but no actual belief. They could act like they have reached such a conclusion, they could act like they believe it. If by "reach a conclusion" you mean have the subjective experience of reaching the conclusion then by definition (they have no subjective experiences) they cannot reach any conclusion about anything. If by "reach a conclusion" you mean act just like a non-zombie who has had the subjective experience of reaching the conclusion then yes they can act like they have reached the conclusion. (Also by definition since zombies can act just like non-zombies.) 

People become concerned about "the meaning of life" when they have insufficient emotional involvement with their own activities. Abstracted from this context the question has no meaning itself. 

All true statements about the past are facts. Actually statements are either true or false but strictly speaking are not themselves 'facts'. There are lots of facts that have never been stated and never will. The 'fact' is the set of circumstances as laid out in the statement. We can never be certain that any given statement is true so we can never be certain of the facts of whatever matter we are talking about but that doesn't change the definition/concept. 

PS: Etymology helped me to perceive the similarity between Validity (in deduction) and Strongness (in induction), because the etymon of 'valid' (valere) means 'to be strong'. So Validity and Soundness meant the same thing etymologically, except that now the former applies to deduction and the latter induction. 

In the 2 Logic textbooks read (the above and Hurley's), each exercise on deductions (e.g. the following) divulges the (in)validity of the argument, and so enables you to know instantly what to do. But without computers, for arguments with > 10 long, convoluted premises: what if the (in)validity were concealed or tacit? Per the above, I already know that a Valid Argument can be proven only with Deduction, and an Invalid Argument disproven with a Counterexample. But before 1. writing a Deduction or 2. finding a counterexample, you must have conjectured the argument, respectively, 1. valid and 2. invalid (Otherwise, how would you know to write a Deduction or find a counterexample?!?) So how would you conjecture (in)validity before doing the work? 

To emphasise the pertinence of the following to all other languages wherewith Logic can be communicated, I use grey font colour to denote the abstract lexemes. Abbreviate Necessary Condition to NC, Sufficient Condition to SC. I already know that: 

Most fundamentally and in specific response to your request.. But alas, special relativity does away with the concept of absolute simultaneity, and as a result it renders physically meaningless the idea of a metaphysical or "real" Now-somewhere-else. That's the trouble with metaphysical notions, by definition they aren't supportable by empirical results. 1) In what sense can we ask if the moon exists, if it is 1 light second away? In the same sense we always have, that we have empirical experiences such as we describe. There is no scientific or empirical problem here only worrying about something that was outside of experience to begin with which is why you referred to metaphysics. There is no philosophical problem either if you don't posit such metaphysical constructs with "metaphysical existence." 2) Is there a notable discussion of this problem in philosophy? Probably but it is unfortunate. The lesson from Special Relativity here is that such speculative notions just don't hold up and can be abandoned. 

It all depends on what you mean by 'meaningless'. Start with what you mean by 'meaning'. We say words have meanings because of their associations in conventional usage. I doubt that you mean this kind of meaning. Other things have meaning to those who know about causal relationships between the stimulus (the thing said to have meaning, say a certain pattern of a footprint)and some other points of interest (It's from a deer, made only in the last hour, and the deer went 'that a way'). The same pattern might have no such meaning to a city dweller who has no experience in such a thing. Both instances of meaning are related whereby some information/experience is said to have meaning because it can tell us more than just a random pattern. I rather doubt that this is the notion of meaning that you are concerned with as well. I think that you mean 'emotional meaning'. This refers to aspects of situations that you personally care about. It is not entirely unrelated to the earlier examples but seems much closer to your concern. People will say that their lives are meaningless when they are emotionally disconnected from their activities. They are doing things that they don't care much about. Emotional meaning is all about YOU. Figure out what you want to do/ what you think that you should do, at least try to start sorting it out. Given some time, if you think it through, try different things you'll find your own direction, a direction (or directions) that you sincerely care about pursuing. Then as you make progress and suffer failures your life will be full of meaning. I didn't intend the above as a self help talk although if it sounds like one that's incidental but fine by me."Life" is a word, if you want it to have more meaning than that you are just alienated from your own activities and confusing meaning of a word with personal purpose. I make this as a philosophical point. I believe it's called a category mistake.

1. Please explain how the bolded would 'avoid the fallacy'? 2. In general, what 'premise(s)' can be added, or are required. to ensure transitivity? 

I would think that Whitehead would be what you want. From Wikipedia... Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.[18] Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy. The notion of "process" is just another word for change. In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" are problematic. These "classical" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks.[86] What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events.[87] After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a "society" of events.[88] By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness").[76][89]

But how does the green argument logically equal the red? One problem is the arguments' difference in conclusions: 3 does not equal 6. 

If I'm correct, Benatar is foregrounding the the deprivation of choice common to pro-life and pro-death: both outlooks forestall someone from choosing abortion and death. But how'd this consequence (of the pro-death) sway pro-lifers? A pro-lifer'd never accept some of the pro-death outlook's premises. Though a "legal pro-death policy would require even pro-lifers to have abortions," pro-lifers can reject the pro-death, while upholding their pro-lifer, outlook. 

Am I correct that in 1, the italicised infinitival clause describes generalisation? Then does 2 contradict 1? 

Source: Art: A Beginner's Guide (2012) by Laurie Schneider Adams (1941-2015) (So I can't ask the author). p. 12 Middle. My entitled question concerns the sentences indicated by the red vertical line: why would they pertain less to Pop Art (under which Warhol's works fall)? 

the objective counterparts would form a world having the same structure as the phenomenal world This is just saying that if you make a true statement "about the world" it is necessarily given more or less directly in terms of our perceptions.Since the statement is true there must be something "out there" (responsible for our perceptions) that has the kind of structure given in the statement. So we have the structure indicated by our statement and some external arrangement of 'stuff' acting in the manner described by the statement. In short, every proposition having a communicable significance must be true of both worlds or of neither. So whatever we say in a statement must apply to the world of experience and the objective world and if true in the world of experience is also true for whatever 'stuff' it is describing. 

There is no way to detect a particle in two locations at once, that's the whole idea. Saying that it is in two places at once is not an empirically meaningful statement. Neither is saying that the cat is alive and dead at the same time. Quantum mechanics definitely does not claim that the cat is alive and dead at the same time or that particles are in two places at once. A better statement would be that the particle doesn't actually have any location until detection. Also that the cat has no properties at all until such properties are empirically determined. That was the problem with the EPR proposal, assuming "elements of reality" in-between interactions/measurements. The conceptual construct of "dead" or "alive" is a 100% non probabilistic state (at least as conceived by an individual within his frame of reference). This 100% certainty can be seen as an 'objective reality' for the individual with that information.. This is not well put. Saying that a probabilistic statement is non-probabilistic because we are certain of the probabilities is really just a word game. Being certain that we don't know something is at best "subjective reality".

I comprehend that to prove an argument containing only Conditional Statements (as all its premises and conclusions), you must assume separately some antecedent, because otherwise, with what else can you start the proof? In despite of my comprehension above, I am still troubled by the bolded sentence above: Why do CP and IP succeed where DM fails? After all, any method is operating on the same premises and conclusions; so it seems strange that CP and IP can abstract something more from the same argument than DM can.

I understand the first paragraph (on the general distinction between FC and HG), but I do not comprehend how 2 is a class statement. To me, 2 can be equally interpreted correctly as 3 below. I accept that 2 is likelier than 3, because 2 asserts a decrease in the mean average of fuel consumption, whereas 3 asserts a decrease in each vehicle's fuel consumption but 3 is certainly possible (For example, if suddenly a law were enacted that allowed only electric cars).
