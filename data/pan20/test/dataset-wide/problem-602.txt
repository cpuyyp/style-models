I'll assume that single bumps aren't the issue (hardtail MTB riders take quite big hits on flat bars), but local fatigue from riding all day on rough surfaces is. I ride flat bars with touring tyres (marathon plus 28), and like to ride trails like these when I get the chance (although my trips are shorter). Definitely padded gloves will help, but the padding generally suffers over the course of the day unless you go for gel gloves and like them (or neoprene but I've only tried that in winter gloves). I've found that the main solution is a good basic grip postion combined with the ability to grip differently for a while. I've got some ergo grips with stubby bar-ends a bit like these (chainreaction cycles - no copyright info so link only). They need adjustment to be much use as you need to get your wrist on a good angle. Even once this is optimised you've still got some wiggle room While there's some give in the surface a major benefit is that they spread the load over more padding. In the default position you can cover the brakes but it's easier on your wrists if you don't. Turning your hands outwards gives a few positions differing slightly, but relying on your palm rather than gripping the bar ends. How you grip makes a big difference - i.e. don't grip too tight (but of course you don't want your hand sliding around either). For that, the right gloves for your grips help especially if there's rain or sweat around. And change hand positions when you're happy to (considering access to brakes etc.) rather than when you feel the need as it's too late by then. 

One thing that may help a lot is shifting some load weight forwards. In other situations I've found that a surprisingly small amount of weight shifted from behind the back axle to the front forks improves handling a lot. For example rather than mounting a D lock behind a child seat, I put it on the front forks. That's something like 1% of the total weight, or 4% of the non-rider weight. This may lead to a bar bag, bar/fork-mounted bottle holders, or front panniers, though I'm trying to avoid the latter (as it seems are you). Even loading differently within the panniers might make a difference. 

Ebay - if you can figure out the thread size, it's often the best/cheapest way for small quantities of stainless bolts. 

This will heavily depend on your maximum cadence, and to a lesser extent on what your knees can handle. Specifically the maximum cadence at which you can deliver reasonable power as for many of us there's quite a drop-off in efficiency as we get close to spinning out. Your knees probably don't want a single gear that's too hard if you're going to be stopping/starting a lot (again, if you're training for track riding that might be different, but this is a commuting question). Example case: I considered a single-speed for the short, flat leg of my (bike/train/bike) commute, but ended up getting an old cheap bike as anything better is likely to get stolen (that 30lb bike but older and more basic). In an almost completely flat ride I don't use all the gears but I do use quite a lot. It's a triple and I use the whole middle ring plus and shift into the big ring when I run out of cogs. The range of gears I get through is around 2.8--7 metres development, a factor of 2.5. On a decent sprint I reach 100 rpm in top, still accelerating, before having to slow down, on one of the longer uninterrupted stretches (400 m or 1/4 mi). To look at it another way that top gear is around 90 gear inches, higher than the 60--75 I typically see recommended for commuter SS, which feels too high for good pulling away in traffic when I stop unexpectedly in that type of gear. In a way this disagrees with the long in 

Taking the average measured data as a reference, all the horizontal distances are within 0.5%. Vertically, bikehike is a good match to my data (and recall that AUK reckon it's a good match to counting contours). Strava route builder over-estimates by 18%, but Google under-estimates by 40%. I don't have all the OS maps for this route at a sufficient scale, neither do I have the patience (and the contours might well be omitted in the urban sections). Conclusions When building a route: 

I've had a few years of only slightly less distance per week on entry level components (mix of mountain and road shimano on a GT hybrid, gearing is 3x8) so you can do it without spending a fortune. I'm a similar weight to you. In 30-40 000km I have replaced the chain and cassette a few times, crankset (riveted) once and BB twice. I didn't take particularly good care of it. I've also had to replace the back wheel when the rim broke at the end of a spoke. I took the chance to fit a 36 spoke touring wheel (hand finished in a factory; it was perfectly true and stayed that way for months). There are enough potholes that I can't always go round them in traffic, but unweighting the saddle helps a lot with reducing the load on the bike. 

I suggest you find a bike shop that stocks it and take the laptop. I work round the corner from a big branch of a chain. If it's on their website (and I'm sure it will be) they can get it in next day for you to try. In my case it's near enough my cheapest option as well taking into account delivery charges elsewhere. 

P-clips are designed to bend into shape, whether made of steel or plastic. The steel kind are really quite flexible and will pull into th right shape as you tighten them. However I suggest using a (fairly large) washer under your fastener (a square washer would be even better) to make sure that the sharpest bend is away from the fastener and supported. 

I take a different approach to @Criggie, as many of the roads I ride are potholed, narrow, and/or winding. On descents I stay wide and take the lane -- I can see hazards ahead (and also be seen better). If I decide to look for somewhere to pull in, I sit up, stop pedalling and start scanning (with head, not just eye movements). Then when I do see somewhere to pull in, I give a slowing signal (scroll down) on the left (we drive on the left in the UK). Strictly speaking a slowing signal should be given on the right, but that looks too much like a right turn signal given that most drivers don't seem to have much of a clue about arm signals; it also occupies the primary braking hand. Because I was in the middle of the lane (or the middle of the road if single track) to start with, my lane positioning gives a further clue to those behind that I'm pulling in -- it's not just a little wiggle like going round debris, I move half a lane to the side. I also unclip even if I don't intend to completely stop, but I tend to unclip in plenty of time as a precaution. I'm reluctant to wave cars past, except when at the back of a group and relaying signal from further ahead. Drivers are too unpredictable to make judgement calls for them (there are plenty that are slower than you'd think), and I often don't have that much more line of sight than they do. However once I've pulled in to let them pass, I often wave them on.
