There's little point in lecturing someone, IMO; ideally they should want to listen, for some reason. 

IMO "cultivating ethical conduct" is good but it's not like full-time meditation. If laypeople aim for rebirth in one of the lower heavens then maybe, I suppose, they aren't hoping to become enlightened in this life. It also says, 

Yes, actually I don't think they do manage with just one Bible. In the Catholic Church, for example, the equivalent of "the dharma" is IMO "the magisterium" which includes teachings by the Pope and Bishops. 

Then there's pages 154 and 155 of this PDF -- the fourth vow is to repent the evil karma of misdeed (which might be where "repentance" comes from), and one of the three kinds of repentance is Dharma ritual, 

But if enlightenment is the only scape, I am afraid of never being able to come back. I guess this too is one of the problems which enlightenment is intended to solve. I think it looks like the problem you're describing happens because of view that there's an "I" which might come and go (or an "I" which might "go" and not "come back") -- at least according to the Pali canon this sounds like an "identity view", which is an unenlightened view and part of the problem (it's a view that leads to suffering, as you say). 

Practically, religious images are made using precious medals to prevent decay, so that the image can be available to venerate for many generations to come. From a more devotional aspect, choosing materials that we think of as beautiful shows a great reverence for the person that image represents. Religious images often "open and lift our minds" to higher ideals, including dharma practice, which is why, for example, people can be better practiticioners just by being in the temple's main hall, where the main images usually are. I suppose a good analogy is showing respect for your boss and co-workers by coming to work in what best represents the workplace's business casual dress code, not just in a T-shirt with holes. Or, having enough respect for yourself to attend to your basic hygiene before leaving your home. Precious metals and stones are frequently used in religious imagery. For example, in the Larger Pureland Sutra (Verse 54), we have: 

Well, a lot of institutions do both. At my Thai Forest (Theravdin) sangha, there are golden images, and we also give to charity, and obviously we do not charge for any services. The retreats, and even the Thai language classes, are completely donation-based. We do not shame anyone who cannot donate anything, and people with means donate more than enough to make-up for it. So we make sure that nothing keeps people from learning, not even lack of funds. Not everyone will probably agree with this, but I propose that artistic beauty is an intrinsic good. This is why we continue to promote the arts in the secular world--I can't eat a beautiful painting, but it can nourish my mind, even if only in the moment I am looking at it. In my experience with working and feeding homeless people in a religious setting, many liked that we were providing them with food and warm shelter in the cold, as well as a beautiful setting to just appreciate our art. I don't know if many of us who have an almost unlimited access to beautiful images through internet searches can fathom living a life where all you saw was ugly, dark decay. It does not make for a healthy mind, which goes hand-in-hand with a healthy body. So to answer your question, in the real world, it does not have to be an either/or decision (between beauty/charity), nor is it a zero-sum game where charity is sacrificed for art. When there are greedy people heaping up image after image for greed's sake, perverting the purpose of Buddhist imagery--which is to communicate the dharma--there should be accountability. The presence of art wouldn't hinder the advocacy of accountability. 

It is not pretending, like Suminda said. One way to very truly understand this is to enumerate the number of X you have. You have X amount of breaths in your current life-body-mind. You have X amount of times you will be able to visit Buddhism SE in your current life-body-mind. You have X number of smiles you will give to another person in your current life-body-mind. You have X number of meditation sessions you will be able to practice in your current life-body-mind. Etc. Patiently enumerate it. It is not false to realize that life is not permanent. 

A Buddhist teacher who has bodhisattva ethics would not keep more money than needed. He would utilize the remaining for generous funds to help others--and not just by mere charity but perhaps by creating an investment fund or funding a project, etc. a truly good teacher has a mind beyond us and would never be stuck in the small way of human attachment to comfort! That being said, a truly good teacher might be not be successful per se (a good teaching is unwelcome due to the karmic tension it would cause in one's life) and vice versa. 

IMO because they're not teaching Dharma (#1 above) so the normal reasoning (#2) isn't applicable. It might be (but isn't necessarily) unethical for #3, e.g. if they make fraudulent (untrue) claims about the benefits of what they're teaching, or if they don't deliver (competently teach) what they promised. On the other hand, many mindfulness centres in the west offer retreats in exchange for "suggested" donations. The little experience I have of that is of a group of people renting a room in which to meet -- where a small amount of money per person was volunteered, a collection to pay to rent the meeting room. 

I'm not sure if this counts as an answer, but ... I think that some (other) people ask a similar question, to "prove" the existence of God. They argue that, "If something (i.e. the universe) exists then someone (i.e. God) must have created it. If the universe was created by the Big Bang, then what created the Big Bang? The answer is, 'God'." They point to some infinite chain of causation, assume there must have been a "prime cause", and call that prime cause "God". You seem to be arguing something similar -- "a cause for consciousness isn't evident, therefore present consciousness must have been caused by a previous consciousness, reborn from a previous life." Is that a fair summary of the argument? So far as I know, the Buddha in the suttas doesn't answer that question. There's a sutta (Assu Sutta (SN 15.3)) translated as 

The general understanding is that even the most beautiful objects we have on earth still pale in comparison to the beauty of the dharma, and this is just our feeble attempt to reflect that, and, like Jyothi said, offer our best to the Supreme One, who gives us a much more valuable gift. Edit - user70 clarified: 

The first statue is not Gautama Buddha (commonly referred to as "the Buddha"), but is Budai, a depiction of a loving and jovial Chinese monk, who is often considered a depiction of Maitreya, the next Buddha who will come into the world eons from now. Even some of the "skinny" Buddha statues may or may not be an image of Gautama Buddha. It mostly depends on the mudras (position of the hands) and the symbols used in the depiction. For example, usually Gautama Buddha has at least one palm facing inward with his fingers pointed towards the ground, but often today, commercialized statues sold in the west depict him in any kind of way because they do not understand the mudras and symbolism. 

It's not really a rationalization, since ethical behavior in Shin Buddhism isn't done to gain something, even though it generally results in a more peaceful, happy life. It is more like a result of the transformative power of shinjin. Reference: Living in Amida's Universal Vow, "Ethics in American Jodo-Shinshu: Trans-ethical Responsibility", pg. 201 

I think the previous answers are good but there's more to it.. The dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya, together called the trikaya are the key summary of Buddhism and in fact Taoism and the whole spiritual shebang. It encompasses all virtues, all powers, and all the things that you could possibly want. One can work on each body and still not gain the others. They are interpenetrating but they are also worked on individually. This means that you can be Enlightened but not have any powers (effects of sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya). I like to describe the Trikaya through the powers that one gains from perfecting them. Body of Essence: Dharmakaya: being free from birth-and-death, no ego, disillusionment Body of Virtue: Sambhogakaya: all the paramitas completed, all virtues completed Body of Manifestation: Nirmanakaya: self-duplication (think Naruto), thought emanations, thought manifestation The Zen masters all had the dharmakaya but usually did not complete the sambhogakaya or nirmanakaya. They were just like "Ah, I got everything. Worldly people and their affairs don't matter to me. Everything is emptiness. I am not real and neither are they. All that matters is my true self, which is indescribable. Off I go." But there was more to the Buddhist project than that! Some Mahayanist masters on the other hand had the dharmakaya and the sambhogakaya, they exemplified stellar character yet also had deep realizations of the soul that the Zen masters had. They had achieved dharmakaya and sambhogakaya. Lastly, some Taoist masters have the nirmanakaya but not the previous. They could perform miracles, thought manifestation, etc. Many could even live for thousands of years at a time. Nonetheless, they held too strongly to their notion of a self and did not see their true nature, their true self which exists beyond the body and mind. But they could live forever, so that's something isn't it? Wrong. The Buddha said that these people are living the wrong path and he could see deep into their future lives and said they would suffer repercussions in the future lifetimes for it. (Of course you and I don't any of these three so we'll suffer even worse repercussions I think! So don't be looking down on these immortals with this piece of knowledge you have just attained.) Many seers and people that can do things with their chi energies? They are all just playing with the nirmanakay body. Ever mantra and feel like the Buddha is helping you? That's a nirmanakaya manifestation. A whole bunch of them. Big secret: A Buddha actually completed the cultivation of Trikaya and stays in a separate dimension and sends out his nirmanakaya manifestation to people based on causes-and-conditions. Big secret #2: We all actually have ALL three bodies, too. They are a range and you can see in your experience how much of each body you have achieved. Each can be summarized respectively in the following qualities: true awareness, true virtue, true power. As you climb the spiritual ladder, you will develop these qualities but with the Trikaya model and the other models in Buddhism, you can turn it into a much more fun project and work on what you're missing... in a very long-term sense since usually nobody accomplishes all three Trikaya in one lifetime. For more on this subject of Buddhism with this kind of thinking read "How to Measure and Deepen Your Spiritual Realization" by Bill Bodri. Definitely, know that the Trikaya are NOT just some psychological thing. They involve things like spiritual immortality, immortality of character, and immortality of the flesh-body (respectively). They umbrella the entire scope of development of everything with of course importance placed on the development of Buddhist emptiness for spiritual immortality and virtue and Taoism for cultivation of the power of multiple body emanation (yang shen). 

What you quoted in the OP is a list of various (several) ascetic practices. I presume these were actual (current/contemporary) behaviour practiced by some people at the time. There's a bit about Ascetism in Indian religions on Wikipedia. Siddhārtha Gautama tried to practice austerities himself, but found it unhelpful; e.g. MN 36 describes many types of austerities he practiced, which end with his thinking: 

Moving on from there, some people who know very little about Buddhism might think that "Buddhism teaches that the outside world is an illusion". I wondered where that belief might come from and found Maya (illusion). If "Maya" is more Indian or Vedic than Buddhist, the more-Buddhist counterparts to that might be Saṃsāra (which is Sankrit and Pali), or perhaps Vipallasa (distortions of the mind). I think that (Vipallasa) is a more standard view in the Pali canon: it's a view/philosophy that we mis-see, that we mis-understand the (whole, outside and inside) world. 

Other answers on this site suggest that Jainism was already established when the Buddha was teaching, for example, 

Apparently there's a Trikaya and Dharmakāya doctrine. I don't know, maybe you might want to say that all Buddhas are of the same Dharmakāya -- perhaps analagous to saying that there's no such thing as two different nirvanas. But Dhammakaya is not especially a Theravāda doctrine (except see also the 'Dhammakaya Movement of Thailand'). 

Ooh touchy subject. According to my teacher, Jesus achieved a level of Awakening and opened up a lot of his chakras including his Throat Chakra (which is really hard to open). He did not achieve Buddhahood or Arhatship but achieved powers that happen due to the 2nd training in Buddhism (concentration). One of these is the nirmanakaya manifestation body which is why he could manifest a body even after he left his crucified body. And you know.. you can't be too harsh to Jesus's teachings. A lot of the religious teachings (including Islam) are wrong by the highest standards (Buddhism) but perhaps such Awakened "prophets" created such teachings to help improve people's karma (restrictions on behavior, the 1st training of Buddhism) and to help focus their minds. Without such primitive religions, the warmongerers among us may have taken over and destroyed any chance for truly integrated understanding we have today. 

I'm glad you have such a closeness with him and you are already doing as much as you can for your dog while also improving your own cultivation. Good job! 

Yes! This is the whole aim of the Arhat's path! This is the goal of the 3rd training! Instead of the word "destroy" it is better to think of it as "transform" because that is what it actually is. (Read Heart Sutra to understand this concept. Keep it in mind. Read Diamond Sutra Explained after.) The hindrances are basic energy that once you transform to its positive form--even if you do it temporarily--will give you tremendous energy in all its positive forms! Anyway, that was the answer to your question. But may i ask... How is this done? The three trainings. 1st training, morality, does a very temporary, repressive hold on the hindrances and afflictions. This is why success in the 2nd training is pivotal. Once jhana is attained, each of the 5 factors of jhana temporarily but completely quells the 5 hindrances! This releases a tremendous amount of mental and physical energy and one feels truly oneself finally. Fun Exercise: Make a table and think for yourself which concentration factor attacks which hindrance?? This is crucial because the 3rd training, the training of wisdom, requires that tremendous energy and focus from jhana. The goal of (Theraveda) Buddhism is success in this "last" training because it brings permanent resolution of the 5 Hindrances. Nonetheless, may I repeat, one will not succeed in this "permanent resolution of the 5 hindrances" unless one succeeds in a temporary cure of the 5 Hindrances (through mastering at least 1st jhana). What are the medicine for each respective hindrance? Each respective factor of the 5 Faculties. How does one train them? Through facility in jhana, the 2nd training. Note: Some argue that jhana is not necessary, the "dry insight" people, that this is going directly against the original suttas which speak of the benefits of jhana repeatedly ad nauseum. Note 2: In Mahayana Buddhism, we go one step further and achieve Buddhahood by going beyond the afflictions and hindrances. In Mahayana Buddhism, once the goal of mastering the hindrances is achieved (3rd training), we go back to the 1st training (morality) and save all beings before entering into Perfect Nirvana. This is true Buddahood. 

You mentioned the "five aggregates" too. I don't think it's necessary to try to remember all five simultaneously (nor even possible, if I can only remember one thing at a time). I think they're intended as a list, a detail associated with the anatta doctrine: i.e. it's wrong to think of myself as me, as if I'm one thing only ... instead an analysis of what one might normally think of as "me" or "mine" suggests that there are actually five aggregates, and not just one "me" (i.e. there's "form", "sensation", etc.). But it's also better to not identify with any one those five aggregates (nor to see them as permanent). I don't suppose you have to try to remember them all the time, just know (if or when it becomes relevant) that each should be seen as included in (not an exception to) the list of things to be regarded as not-self and impermanent (and that "clinging aggregates" are associated with suffering). 

Looking at your example I suppose that "being thirsty" might be a craving to live, "wanting a new car" might be craving a sense-object, and "wanting your loved one" might be craving to be separated from a painful feeling of not being with them. 

Intercessory prayer is viewed as, at most, superfluous to the practice of Nembutsu. Practically, Amida is seen as unlimited in his power and scope. Maintaining the Mahayana teaching of sunyata (non-duality), there is no separation between "I" and "Amida". He knows our minds precisely (maybe more) than we do, and feels our suffering as his own. As a limitless Provider (as Oya), he knows what we need and gives freely, just as children don't have to beg for good food from a good parent (Reference for this teaching below). So, in this way, the practice is redundant. From "Prayer and Nembutsu" by Rev. Shoko Masunaga is Minister of the San Mateo Buddhist, Church San Mateo: 

(Source URL: $URL$ Saying that, individual followers may act spontaneously, voicing dharmic aspirations as reminders for our limited selves, not to "persuade" Amida to act this way or that. Reference: Naturalness: A Classic of Shin Buddhism by Kenryo Kanamatsu 

In Jodo Shu and Jodo Shinshu, Amitabha Buddha is the sole object of devotion, because to be devoted to Amitabha Buddha is seen to be devoted to all the Buddhas, in spirit and practice. Reciting Nembutsu is seen as fulfilling the aspirations of all the Buddhas, including Shakayamuni and Avalokitesvara.
