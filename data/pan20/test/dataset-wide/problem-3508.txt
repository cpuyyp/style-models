I'm reading Klemperer's survey on auction theory (pages 17-18) which discusses the relation between traditional microeconomic price theory and the revenue equivalence result. Firstly, I don't quite understand the analogy: marginal revenue is the revenue due to additional quantity sold, but an auction might just sell a single non-divisible object. 

It seems reasonable to assume that bidders will not bid more than $p(x)$. Hence, $b_1,b_2\in[0,p(x)]$. Then, it makes sense to consider two cases: where $x<p(x)$. Here the expected payment is simply the expected payment of the lower valuation bidder, namely, $\frac{p(x)}{2}$. Secondly, we should consider the case where $x>p(x)$: the expected payment is here, the probability of facing a below-$p(x)$-valuation opponent, times their bid, plus the probability of facing an above-$p(x)$-valuation opponent times the probability of winning (ties are broken randomly) times $p(x)$ $$p(x)*\frac{p(x)}{2}+(1-p(x)*\frac{1}{2}*p(x))=\frac{1}{2}p(x)$$ 

So, the answer is no. Panel (a) is not possible in perfect competition. And it follows much of the idea from the previous answer. The price will be equal to the average cost if the firm is to have zero profit. Moreover, from the maximization of the firm's problem, price will also equal the marginal cost. This situation is given to you on panel (b). 

As mentioned in Herr K's comment, asset pricing is the theory to price assets (such as equity, bonds, options, futures, swaps, etc). For this, you can use models like CAPM/Fama-French (returns), Black-Scholes (options), Swensonn (interest rates), and many many others. When you say empirical asset pricing, this means that you go to the data (and each model deals with a different type of data) and try to price an existing asset based on the information that you see on the market. For example, in the Black-Scholes model, given the current stock price (S), the strike price for the option (K), the time until exercise (T-t), the risk-free rate (r) and the volatility of returns (sigma), you can use the formula directly and calculate the price of the option. Notice that this would be a theoretical price. In practice, you might observe something else in the market. You may want to do some arbitrage from here since there is mispricing (Don't go using this in the real market, but you get my point). For your last question, asset pricing is not necessarily just about the current value of an asset. You probably would also want to estimate future values based on your models. In fact, it is really of no use a model that tells you today's price. For that, you just look at the price on the tape and ignore your model. The whole point of building models is to make predictions. 

The typical dynamic consumption-saving under certainty model can be written as: $$ \max V(c)=\sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\; u(c_t) $$ Subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $$ \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_t}{1+r}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{c_t}{1+r} $$ Where $T\leq \infty$ (finite or infinite horizon), $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor, $y_t$ is the individual's income and $c_t$ is the individual's consumption in every time period. Finally, $u(\cdot)$ is the agent's subutility function, with $u^{\prime}>0$ whose concavity is usually related to the agent's preference for consumption smoothing. The argument is equivalent to the one justifying that an individual will reveal risk aversion iff his utility function over wealth is strictly concave. The argument that leads to consumption smoothing is the following: The first order condition for the problem is the well known Euler equation $$ \frac{u^{\prime}(c_t)}{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}=\beta \; (1+r) $$ It is assumed that $\beta^{-1}=(1+r)$ so that $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow \text{by strict concavity of} \; u \quad c_t=c_{t+1} $$ I have two questions regarding this argument which are somehow related: 

Fama-French library has good data on which you can test your first Fama-French regression model. I have found this video on Youtube that might help you with this first project. Ps.: It would help a lot if you were more specific about what you want to learn. I can give other suggestions, but I really don't know what you are looking for. 

Yes, this is supposed to be the GDP. You can interpret it as being the sum of all aggregate value in the economy, so all intermediary goods and services are already in there. 

Suppose the competitive price is P. If you quote at a a higher price Ph2>P, then someone else, say firm 2, will quote at a slightly lower price than you, say Ph2, and Ph1>Ph2>P. Since competition is perfect, firm 2 will capture all the market and you will go bankrupt. But firm 3 may put price Ph3 such that Ph2>Ph3>P and capture all the market. This process can be repeated until the equilibrium price is reached. On the other hand, if you place a price that is below the competitive price, you will go bankrupt. Hence, there is no economic rent because all firms in the competitive equilibrium will choose the equilibrium price which gives them an economic profit(rent) of zero. 

In The Wind of Change: Maritime Technology, Trade and Economic Development (2015), Pascali estimates various effects on freight rates (i.e. the cost of transport) on outcomes such as trade volumes and economic development. To do this, he exploits a kind of natural experiment that results from the fact that different shipping routes benefit in different ways due to the preexisting wind patterns (i.e. those with wind flows against the route direction). I guess this controls for demand for shipping, so that freight rates are exogenously affected by transport times. But I don't understand why this is needed to estimate the effects of shipping technology. Isn't the invention of the steamship itself an experiment that allows you to see the effects of shipping technology on trade volume? Why is this additional variation due to asymmetric benefits needed? 

Would still hold for a strictly convex utility function, as one needs a much general condition to the implication to hold, namely that the derivatives of the utility function will be unique for any increasing utility function.. it seems to be that the uniqueness of $u^{\prime}$ (i.e $u^{\prime}(a)=u^{\prime}(b) \quad \Rightarrow a=b$) will hold irrespective of the sign of $u^{\prime \prime}$ provided it is not equal to zero. If my thinking is correct this would imply that the desire for smoothing doesn't play any role on what the individual does at the end, as this possibility is open only when $\beta =(1+r)$ holds, and furthermore, it would be optimal to smooth out consumption even to an agent with a strictly convex utility function. 

A speculative bid in a Vickrey auction means that it is not what the bidder really thinks that the product is worth. Hence, a speculative bid is anything different from the true valuation of this product by the bidder (either a smaller or a larger price than the true one). In a Vickrey auction, the bidder has incentive to reveal his/her true valuation. If he/she does not do so, he/she risks losing (either by winning the bid and paying more than what the product is worth for them - if price was higher than true valuation -, or by losing the bid - if price was lower than true valuation). 

Then he introduces Recursive Utility (RU) as a class of preferences developed to overcome these issues. He then proceeds to study the properties of RU, without stopping to study these "shortcomings". I am interested in the following: even though I could try to derive the anomalies myself, is there a article/textbook/survey article that studies formally (by formally I mean in a decision theoretic fashion, i.e studying the axioms and their effect on the representation) the structure of TAEU and show formally the shortcomings mentioned above? The author offers references for textbook and survey treatments of RU, but not the TAEU. Thank you very much for any comment and help! 

I have attempted the following: $$\pi_1(v_1,v_2)=p(v_2<\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))$$ $$=(1-\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))$$ If this is an equilibrium, we must have that $$=(1-\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1)) \geq (1-\beta(w))(v_1-\beta(w))$$ for all $w\in[0,1]$. Hence, $$\left.\frac{\partial \pi_1(v_1,v_2,w)}{\partial w}\right|_{w=v_1}=-v_1\beta'(v_1)-\beta'(v_1)+2\beta(v_1)\beta'(v_1)=0$$ $$\iff\beta(v_1)=\frac{1+v_1}{2}$$ But this strikes me as clearly wrong, if $v_1=0$ why should the player overbid? What am I missing? 

I'm confused with this (which probably stems from my confusion with the earlier parts): if you sell 1 item, then trivially the marginal revenue equals the expected revenue. Surely I am missing something here. 

I'm not sure why "the marginal revenue of this firm at the price that equals the bidder’s actual value". Does this not assume that the bidder actually bids his actual value? This surely isn't the case for e.g. first-price auctions.

A classic on public choice and taxation theory is "The Power to Tax: Analytic Foundations of Fiscal Constitution" by Brennan and Buchanan Really interesting book and relatively easy read. 

More precisely if $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell} : x \geq 0\}$, the production function would be $$ f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n}, \quad n\geq 2 $$ For simplicity we can assume the firm operates in a competitive market so that the price is given. My question is, how does the firm choose the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}$ as to maximize profits? I did some research and apparently the type of problem this is a “multi-objective” optimization problem, and it appears to be an active field in engineering. Some of the methods to solve this kind of problems use pareto-dominance style arguments. I wanted to know if anyone could clarify the specific question of multi product profit maximization, and more generally I would also appreciate any literature or books on this topic (multi objective optimization), written for economists, as I have been searching in google and every book I find appears to be written for engineers. I suspect that a treatment of this topic from an economics point of view would involve some discussion of social choice theory. Any help is most welcomed!
