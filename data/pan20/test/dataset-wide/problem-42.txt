Camels Where I lived in the UAE they were treated similarly - used as beasts of burden, transportation, but also there were regular endurance races and even beauty pageants! They're stronger, bigger, faster and nicer*. They also produce a lot of very nutritious milk. This might not be the sexy answer you're looking for, but when you're riding a camel, it's pretty awesome and your feet are about where a horseback rider's head is, in height. *- never assume, though, that it will be nice! 

My heroine librarian has a fictional pile of mostly standard hardcover novels, books, etc. It is not an organized stack, it is a pile. At what point does this either become unstable or start crushing the bottom books? It can be as wide as necessary, but I'm looking for the height at which the bottom books are still intact and usable (some day). A magnitude of order is okay over precision measurements, because there's a variety of books, and therefore some wiggle-room. Note: It does not have any supports (steel or shelves or anything). I will deal with how books are placed on the pile, but just imagine they're placed sloppily on the top creating a massive pile. 

Erosion Unlike the land surface of the Earth, there will be no aeolian erosion, removing the stark geographies found in dry areas of erosion on land. Underwater currents will most likely be a series of thermoline ocean current loops, which could consolidate sediments along the poles as warm water carries more stuff northwards than cold water does southwards. So maybe two lumpy hills at the poles, deep underwater. This could mean more exposed bedrock along the equator. (Mer)man-made Features There won't be any man-made features, I take it (lakes from dams, reclaimed land, etc.)? So it depends on what your civilization looks like. Maybe large, long stone walls will collect sediments creating stretches of sloped hills upon which Echinoderms and Sea Grass can be raised and harvested. Exposed Surface I believe there will be seasonal surface ice during the year. The reason I don't expect it to be year-round is because water moderates weather and temperatures; our poles, surrounded by land or physically on-land aren't as exposed to the moderating currents as your poles will be. Temporal There may be use in temporal maps, describing places by the process of time: short term (tides) and long-term (seasons). This will be a very boring planet, except for the areas that are formed by volcanic & tectonic activity. 

Store energy by storing the "how-to-do-it" manual. I know that this is not a popular answer, but maybe your book, or your video or your whatever is documented way to use your fantastic energy source. SAVE your information in a powerful way so that anyone can use it at any time. So, with current technology, the best way to store energy for future generations is not to put it in a battery (or whatever) but to put it in knowledge on how to refill the battery. You completed your task with a pen and paper (kind of). Good Q. 

Presuming this advance is feasible, Intercity Travel These trains would not be used within a city (like a subway), but between cities. We calculated in a high-speed train project that stations should be no less than 200km apart to be even useful, and if there were only small towns, they should be skipped and station distances further apart. It would reduce long distance travel times, but seeing as how it's unfeasible for distances of about 1000km or less (to accelerate and then decelerate without killing your passengers, you work up quite a distance), planes, regular-trains, and automobiles will still be used for other distances and certainly commuting. I don't know the math, but the time it takes to get to top speed without killing passengers, you are already more than halfway across the United States. Then you have to decelerate, and you are in the ocean. The feasibility of it would likely only be between MAJOR, distant cities that have connections elsewhere. London to Moscow to Beijing, maybe? People would still take slower trains and planes to other destinations after they disembark. If undersea travel is feasible, then maybe London to New York? I don't think it would have a dramatic effect on society - maybe it can reduce emissions somewhat? 

EDIT - More answer, to try to meet the intention of the story: Further, no - If someone's DNA was altered so drastically (and it would be instantaneous, as cells are constantly dividing), it would not mean that they would have a fast transformation. Suddenly cells are behaving differently, and there are missing cells as well that you need to create. Muscle would start growing in awkward places (breaking out bones), organ failure as they start and stop growing in areas: it would be an ugly and horrific death. Please just have one DNA for the sake of your characters. 

Warm gas like methane filling sacs within your fungi will lift the city until it reaches equilibrium with the atmosphere at around 500m height. This means that even if the fungi continue to produce more gas, your city will max out at around 500m. The weight of your city presses down, but your CH4 -filled fungi press up. Atmospheric conditions are not stable, so there will be a lot of ups and downs - make sure your denizens and engineers are comfortable with that. Note: I am not an artist / Note2: There are two many unknowns for precision math, but this could work for your story at a minimum. 

The resources are all there to create a great roller-coaster. Height This can be variable, but let's go with the largest we see today under construction for a wooden roller coaster, and allow for a 180' drop, and speeds of 72mph. Loops Khufu may have as many loops, such as this, that his heart desires. Keep in mind for your story that there may have to be more assisted ascents for the longer and faster his coaster may go. Maintenance Fortunately, a dryer climate is better for wood, but with wooden (not metal) pegs holding everything together, his engineers would do well to keep a close eye on the joints. Some support beams can be assisted by stone where there is little impact on the rider. 'Cars' will be tricky, as well, as they will be made of wood, with wooden wheels and joints. Seats can be leather stuffed with wool or any other soft material to reduce discomfort for the rider. Operation While you might have to rely on human or camel labor to draw the car upwards, a system of pulleys can reduce the effort on behalf of your 'engines'. The pull on the car will have to be rope-and-hook, but could certainly be doable. The breaking mechanism will be tricky. Maybe one thick board (not your whole car) can stick below the car and catch a long trough of water, which will slow the cars; else, you can use rolling friction and a small hill to slow them down.
