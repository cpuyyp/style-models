The Chiefs finally ended the streak at 21 regular season games when WR Jeremy Maclin caught a TD pass in Week 3 of the 2015 season. 

Wikipedia has a list of the men's singles Grand Slam finals in the Open Era, and it shows the player seedings. There have been 30 unseeded men's Grand Slam finalists since 1968. Eight of those players won the final. There has never been a men's Grand Slam final in the Open Era in which both players were unseeded. The Tennis Channel has an article that lists the unseeded women's Grand Slam finalists of the Open Era up to January 2010. There were 11 unseeded women's Grand Slam finalists between 1968 and the 2010 Australian Open, and 3 of them won the final. 

What you describe is called a "joust" (in American terminology), and it is legal. From Team USA's "Guide to Volleyball Basics": 

Last night I watched the women's snowboard cross event of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. After the semifinal races and before the final race (officially known as the "Big Final"), NBC showed what they called a consolation race - the "Small Final". This race included the 4th through 6th place finishers of the two semifinal races. I know some events will have a consolation match that determines who wins the bronze medal. But this "Small Final" race determined who finished in 7th through 12th place. What is the point of that? Why does it matter who finishes in 7th through 12th place? 

There is no limit to the number of red cards that a referee can give, though the game would be stopped as soon as there are less than 7 players of a team remaining legally on the pitch. As of Law 3 in the FIFA Law Book, there cannot be less than 7 players of a team, on the field during play. In effect, a maximum of 4 on-field players of the same team can be dismissed. Once 5 on-field players (substitutes do not count) of the same team are red carded, the match ends. If the referee has red-carded 4 players and all 7 substitutes of each team (22 players in total), the game can still continue, provided there are no further red cards to players of either side. The law (for continuation of the game) however, states only the on-field players. There is no limit to the number of red cards that can be shown to the substitutes on the bench, the manager and the coaching staff. Also, red cards can be handed to the on-field players/substitutes/coaching staff after the game has ended based on the referee reports and video analysis (wherever applicable). The record for the most red-cards handed out in a single match is during a fifth tier Argentinian league game between Claypole and Victoriano Arenas, where 36 red cards were shown. 

Tim Donaghy, a former NBA referee, wrote a book titled Personal Foul (it was originally titled Blowing the Whistle but was renamed after he had to find another publisher). Deadspin published some excerpts from the book. Donaghy wrote that the fans pay to see star players score a lot of points: 

The Official Rules of Major League Baseball state that base paths are 90 feet long. In addition, the Official Rules state the following: 

Prior to the 16-game regular season era, there were three teams that finished with 11 wins that failed to make the playoffs, according to this ProFootballTalk article: 

As for the worst team to make the playoffs, this Bloomberg article discussing Week 17 of the 2010 season says that only three teams with losing records have ever made the playoffs: 

Basketball In 1992, a team of college stars was formed to help the U.S. men's basketball team (the "Dream Team", with 11 NBA players) prepare for the Summer Olympics. The team had the following players: Chris Webber (Michigan), Grant Hill (Duke), Bobby Hurley (Duke), Anfernee Hardaway (Memphis State), Allan Houston (Tennessee), Jamal Mashburn (Kentucky), Eric Montross (North Carolina), and Rodney Rogers (Wake Forest). The college players defeated the Dream Team in their first 20-minute scrimmage by a score of 62-54. This happened because the NBA players didn't take the college players seriously and hadn't developed any chemistry yet. In addition, Coach Chuck Daly intentionally used poor strategies and didn't try to win the game because he wanted to deflate the NBA players' egos and show them that they could be beaten. Here are some interesting quotes regarding that first scrimmage: 

Over the past couple of seasons, overtaking in Formula 1 has moved from sheer car power and driver skill to also include technology like KERS and DRS. 

Free-hit delivery: The delivery that immediately follows the no-ball (overstepping) in limited overs cricket is a . This means that the batsman cannot be dismissed in any way apart from a run out, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or obstructing the field. So, if the ball hits the stumps and goes to the boundary, the batsman is not-out. Instead the batting team get as for the ball reaching the boundary. If the batsman has nicked the ball before it hit the stumps on its way to the boundary, then all 4 runs are awarded added to the batsman's score. Long story short, if a batsman gets bowled off a free hit and the ball goes to boundary, then YES, 4 runs will be added to the batting side. 

No. There is no card system that is in place for cricket. Action is taken on players after the game and subsequent hearings by the match referee, in case they fail to follow the rules and ethics of the game. The examples that you provided might have been in jest and they, for sure, could not have been ejected from the game. The main reason for other sports to have cards and stricter discipline is that they are contact sports. There is hardly any physical contact with other players in cricket, which reduces the chances of violent behavior. Probably, this is why they call cricket a gentleman's game. 

Based on their list (which includes the home, road, and neutral site records) it seems that up until the early 1970s, teams in certain conferences played each other 4 times during the conference's regular season. During that time, there were quite a few instances of 2 teams playing each other 5 or 6 times in one season, and one instance of 2 teams playing each other 7 times in one season. But the article has a separate list of teams that have played each other at least 4 times in a season since 1975. I presume that since 1975, no conference has had their teams play each other 4 times during the regular season. Since 1975, there have been no teams that have played each other 5 times in one season. 

Is it true that the 3 holes that comprise "Amen Corner" at the Masters golf tournament are so named because it's the most difficult stretch of the golf course and players have to pray to survive it? 

The reason you don't see Aaron Rodgers in that list is because he didn't start his 100th regular season game until this 2014 season. The reason you don't see Brett Favre in that list is because he wasn't active in 2013 (he retired after the 2010 season). 

Though in both, the first and third scenario's, the ball comes off the fielder's hand and goes to the boundary, they are treated differently. This is because in the first scenario, the fielder never had control of the ball that he was trying to stop where as in the third, the fielder had total control of the ball before he chose to throw it to this teammate. Therefore, these two cases are treated differently when it comes to runs awarded. Law 19.7 states that, 

Total runs -> This is straight forward. It is the score that a team scores (batting) and is scored against (bowling) in the whole tournament. Total overs -> This is the total overs played (batting) and delivered (bowling) by a team. This one has a catch though. 

Make them stand at the bowling crease and throw the ball consistently at the stumps. Once they are good enough at step 1, ask them to swing their arms, ala bowling action, before releasing the ball. Once they are comfortable with step 2, make them run in with a very short run up, jump, swing arms before releasing the ball. 

, or is used when both the teams end up on the same score at the end of a T20 game. This is similar to a penalty shootout in football or a tie-breaker in tennis. Both team captains have to give a list of three batsmen and a bowler from their team to the umpire. These 4 players from each team will participate in the super over. The chasing team at the end of the T20 game will bat first in the super-over. 

They played each other in an early season tournament. (You can see this year's Battle 4 Atlantis tournament includes Butler and Georgetown - both from the Big East conference.) They played each other twice as part of the conference's regular season schedule. They played each other in the conference tournament. They played each other in a postseason tournament like the NCAA Tournament, NIT, CBI, or CIT. 

According to this Wikipedia list of NFL records by team, the "Most Consecutive Shutout Games Won or Tied" was 13 by the Akron Pros over the 1920 and 1921 seasons. They finished the 1920 season with 5 straight shutouts (the last 2 were ties), and they started the 1921 season with 8 straight shutouts (the last one was a tie). But the most consecutive shutouts in the modern era is three. This was accomplished by the 1970 St.Louis Cardinals (3 straight shutout wins) and the 1976-77 Steelers (they had 3 straight shutout wins in the middle of the season, and also had 2 straight shutout wins at the end of the regular season and a shutout win in week 1 of the 1977 season). A philly.com article mentions this: 

Below, the statistics for each of the formats (Tests/ODIs/T20s) sorted both by wickets taken on debut and best economy. 1. ODIs 

Differences between red and white balls can vary based on the manufacturers. Kookaburra maintains that their red and white balls are manufactured using the same process apart from the dye used for colouring. They claim that the swing properties of both the balls are similar - as everything, apart from the colour, are the same. This, however, is disputed by the players and researchers who claim that the white ball swings more. Dukes has a different manufacturing process for each of the balls. They claim and tests have proven that the white ball infact swings more than their traditional red balls. This is due to a polyurethane coating on top of the white-dyed leather to ensure that the ball does not get dirty quickly. This coating makes the ball smoother and changes its aerodynamics thereby assisting swing. Going by players feedback and researchers findings, to generalize 

Selecting squad for a series: Each country has a cricket board. This board appoints selectors, who travel across various venues during that country's domestic season and watch a lot of players. Before any series, all the selectors sit along with the national captain and decide the merit of each top performer and select the team based on skill, consistency, requirement, team balance among other factors. Most of the top countries provide the captain (Who is again decided by the selectors) voting rights but it is not followed everywhere. Selecting team for a match: With the team that has been selected for the series, the captain can select any 11 players for each match of the series. The coach provides suggestions and helps the captain in making decisions, but ultimately the final decision lies with the captain. Source.
