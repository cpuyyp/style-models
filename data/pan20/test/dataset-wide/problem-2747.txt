Objectivity often refers to a reference to something related to space and time in the strong sense of measurability. A fact, that Crete is an island, is neutral insofar as it finds general if not universal agreement, among people of ordinary mental capacity. When one is addressed ad hominem (in the tradtional sens eof the word, not the wiki-sense), to one's opinion or inner view, one holds Crete is an island. There's no dispute among most people about that. The agreement allows for a so-called common ground, in which a discussion can happen, because everyone grants they, they themselves, ad hominem or from an orign within, grant the fact: that it appears before them like that. But, viewed relative to space time, scientifically, the agreement that Crete is an island isn't in question. The question is if a competent person, who knows how to survey and measure the coast, can come back with reliable quantified data about the thing one calls Crete, one could call it as coherently "x". Can we make repeated measurement of 'x' reliably? That is objectivity de facto. Another similar subtle nuance is the distinction between "neutral" in your sense, and impartiality. Someone who doesn't have anything particular at stake in a disagreement is not objective, they have opinions which may bias them, but they are impartial insofar as they aren't deliberately for one party or the other. These days the problem of judge impartiality has broken down around this distinction. Biases are read into, confused with, intentions about politics. 

Spinoza follow Descartes' "clear and distinct" (or scientific) method up until the question of the pineal gland, as the connecting point. In his Ethics. I believe, however, that your way of conceiving of the problem does not confront Descartes for the reason that he does not think of the matter of a "self" and a "body" in the modern way. Rather, everything, the whole world, is the cognito. And the extended world is a secret, invisible place, where mechanical action, as a Philosophic Material, is supposed as a hypostasis or Reality behind the appearance. So it is not entirely one's fault for not being able to confront Descartes on his own ground, so to say, but his way of thinking is simply bizarre to the modern mind. Reviewing the objections in Spinoza may be a way to get more familiarity with the issue. Though, it is largely unimportant for the modern mind body question, or something of that kind. 

It's difficult because retrospectively all learning deserves to be called "transvalution." Whenever you "learn" something, e.g., a new fact, get "better informed" about some so-called issue, change your view, you "trans-valuate", you go beyond your old values. Leaving them behind like one who, passing out of Italy, is transalpine. This is also called "framing", as in the United Nations claiming that some practice with a thousand and one name, is now to be called "gentile mutilation". With the clear instruction embedded in the new naming, in the predication, something bad is now named. Before some Westerners had spoken of "female circumcision". Yet, now we Know better, we have learned. But, is all learning brainwashing, a means of coercion or "education", a science of controlling populations, in a word, Power? Or is it really a True, i.e., is morality, as it is tacitly signaled in our understanding of everything, which tells us how to behave with that matter, from God? What is it based on, simply that one holds it to be true, really really believes? What I would say is that Nietzsche is obviously prepared by all the thinkers since Kant, especially Schelling with his "Abyss of Freedom", which is basically the same thing as Existentialism. I.e., the view that all reasoning about moral things is not objective. The difficulty is that for us that view is so matter of fact, so obvious, we can't see that there is anything to the Nietzschean view at all. Hobbes, who, despite his reputation, was a great believer in the Rational and objective moral realm, i.e., that moral thought is like any other sense, objective, like sight or hearing, And not relative to humans, or to all being, or relative in any way, held that moral rules, i.e., laws, could be discovered with the same rigor as mathematical demonstrations. And that they were as much based on Nature as was time and space. 

You're "off target". By Thinking, Descartes means that which allows us to answer the question: What is there? He doesn't mean reasoning about things. One needs three terms: intuition (or knowing of the essence), experience (of the change), and then intellect or rationality (thinking in the sense of reflecting about what we know in memory). He's making a distinction between intuition of essences, knowing that there is wax, and empirical experience of changes in the thing known. The decisive thing is that he's claiming that one can not have empirical experience, memory of changes, without first knowing that something is there. He's not speaking of the way we think about what we learn from experience, i.e., anything that we can remember. 

An addition not mainly necessary or of intrest to the questioner in the form of a caveat emptor: The British or global English tag Deontilogical is arbitrary and misleading. The result of abstracting a part of Kant from the philosophy of Kant in a totally senseless fashion in order to make it fit a textbook. In any serious sense the tag "deontological" does not belong to Kant nor to his system of morality, yet, one is compelled to stick to this because the defective textbook says that. And the professors of philsophknow nothing but that textbook account. One may appropriately call Kan'ts system a Teleological ethics. Of course, duty plays a role in his ethics, but so does it in Utilitarian ethics, and so does Kant also concern himself with many other issues. One could with as much, and as little, sense, call it a Categorical or a Rational ethics. It is neither, its essence is the reception of the moral telos of God. Ethics of Freedom would make somewhat more sense, or ethics of Autonomy. It is through autonomy tha tone is meant to KNOW the noumenal. Why not Ethics of the noumenal. 

The problem with the da Vinci quote is it refers to art in the older sense, a knowledge that lets one build something. One makes shoes by the shoemaker’s art. By science he had in mind theoretical statements such as the kind one finds in geometrical theorems, and of the definitional kind one gets in principles, for instance, concerning the the law of a country. Crude, but hopefully not utterly misleading, précis (with barest skeleton of info): The Reformation led to the opening of academies with non-religious painting. The British came up with the notion of the Fine Arts, Beaux-Arts in France. The current Chinese word for art dates from the Vienna World Exposition of 1876, before that each of the things one calls art were not bundled together by the Chinese, as měishù. The breakdown of the academies opened the age of art for its own sake, personal art. (Remember, that in many places, such as India even after intense British contact in the 18th and 19th centuries, most art went unsigned, and no attention was payed to the maker as a person of distinction or talent.) I would say. 1.Art today concerns biography, personality, the human being as inner being and not as the objective neuronal knowledge of brain systems. 2.Science the possibility of collecting effects, relative to space and time, which could at anytime, and forever, be deployed; but often without essential connection to human affairs. This is a very profound question. I believe one must start by making a distinction between the arts and Art. Insofar as all handicraft, professions, shoemaker, lawyer, chemist (apothecary), were, in former times, regarded as arts, art meant, making something according to a knowledge, according to an art. Today, however, art largely refers to the idea of the artist, the special individual with artistic powers. In a certain sense, the human is totally explored by the figure of this artist, who is supposed to be utterly free. For example, one says, the artist should not be constrained by politics or--most especially--by financial considerations. Art in the older sense, was the art commissioned by patrons. Art in the current sense, is art as the artist going to the limit of their art, and then, also being paid (as though it were something disgusting and beyond art. Or, as it were, what is the same, increasingly these days, with total cynicism and open exploitation of the elite HNWI.) The artist, Art, aims at total annihilation of the human being, as the normal specimen. Art becomes a name for freedom, and not for what the sciences deal with, necessities of nature. But this freedom, can by its more harsh critics, be named the destruction of the human being, insanity, inhumanness, the biography of the “other”, the alien being, the future. On the other hand, when the sciences, become Science, it means we are dealing with that ability to harness all the necessary power of empirical nature. Everything that can be done and kept as a knowledge, as what can be at any time deployed, and repeated. The periodic table of elements, the knowledge of how to combine vast numbers of chemicals and what result that would bring. The knowledge of building all manner of helpful tools, of medical techniques, of warmachines, of destructive gases. What this Science shares with the current art is the emphasis on the absence of moral rectitude. On both sides man shatters his will against the openness of all possibility as never before. Since any limitation, on the basis of moral consideration, that some discovery, stem cells, would threaten the possibility of advancement, is felt somehow as Christian, as backward, as unacceptable to the unconstrained search. 

Are there real shapes corresponding to the non-euclidean maths? I.e., real but not available directly to the senses? Ergo, does God's order, in the Thomistic sense, go beyond the senses towards absolute and unruly, if you like, variegation? Is the statement about the triangle that is Euclidean genuinely made false, in the case that, it refers to the order of the world, of the visible things? Where the visible things, being extended beyond man's current sense-capability, include real triangles that don't fit the "two-right-angle" criteria. 

I can only provide a crude sketch to give the reader a outline of the work that would be involved in understanding this issue properly: As Leo Strauss said it, there is no racial aspect in Hegel. No racism of any kind. The point being, everything in some sense can be made to appear anything else. For example that softness can be said to be like hardness, for the reason that they both involve the sense of solidity or touch. But if we understand a philosopher, a philosophic work, we go beyond the semblance and the sophistic use of it. For Hegel, prior to the biological notion of race, there was no notion of organic defects, the driving issue in Nazi eugenics. For Hegel anyone could, so to say, turn, and join the consciousness of another civilization, or as we say today, culture. Had nothing to do with biology. Except in a very small sense, in the way a redwood planted in the north might turn out different than one in a southern clime. Same with weather's effect on man as universorum, of man as man. So if one looks at it philosophically one agrees with Schmitt, Hegel died on the day the Nazi's came to power. By contrast to Hegel, the great Rationalist, i.e., one who held there was a moral development leading to a universal common good of all men, the end of moral or, one could say, cultural, development of man as man, Nietzsche held there was no such universal end. So, if there is no universal delineation of laws, manners of acting, in short no universal way of life, then it follows that anything goes. This kind of bewilderment, which still persists in our own time, whereby anyone who says anything in the style of a dogmatic is quickly informed that one has the right to one's own opinion on everything. Nietzsche was greatly responsible for articulating this view, which, during the Weimar manifested as the most free, de facto, society that ever existed (considering the censorship in America was in fact very great and legal for the states, not for the Federal authority, during that period) and so the cauldron from which Nazism came. This is a sketch by which I intend to show the reader how, in essential antipathy to the non-philosophic reader, who sees in everything, as it were, everything, and especially the reflection of the current optic which assumes, e.g., race has always been race, the serious reader, which is more closely approximated by the university account, reads according to the way the texts were understood by their authors and by people at the time.
