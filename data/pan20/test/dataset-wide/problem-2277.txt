A fire in combination with a reflector in front or even inside your shelter is a really good way to get a lot of warmth. As for the type of fire: It really depends on your type of shelter, but the so called top-down fire is the one I can really recommend. If done right, this will warm you while building it :) and once lit, will provide you with around 6-8 hrs of warm fire without the need to care a lot about the fire and without too much smoke. The key concept about this fire is to use thick wood (at around 15-20 cm in diameter) for the base. Use 4-6 of these and lay them down parallel to each other. Upon this base, put a little sand/dirt. Just enough to cover the space between the logs. Put the next layer on top in a 90 deg angle, while using slightly smaller wood. Repeat this, until you have 5-7 layers. On top of this yenga-pile, create a normal fire and feed it until the first layer of thicker wood burns as well. The time this fire burns is determined by a few factors: Type, thickness and humidity of the wood used. And obviously on the number of layers, amongst other factors. Now what's so special and cool about this? 

There is no or just little wood above the flames. This reduces smoke a lot. Also the construction allows from loads of fresh air flowing in from the bottom of the flame. The fire burns from thin to thick, top to bottom. Less maintenance. Sure, this takes some time to build and collect the wood for it. However, you don't need to take care of it during the night very much. Means more sleep for you as well as longer sleep periods. Hot ashes and coals will not be wasted, but start to burn/dry the wood under the actual flame. This way you can even use quite wet wood for the base. Safe: This fire is relatively save. This means: Most of the time the burning ashes and flame won't touch the ground and heat it up. 

There will be different approaches depending on how much you are "in charge" of the group. Also, I understand the setting is that the group is already on the trip, possibly with limited possibility to extend or alter food supplies. (If you are just preparing for the trip, then the situation is easier, of course.) If you are on the trip, and intend to share meals prepared by group members in the open, out of supplies you brought with you, then the situation is quite simple. Make a list of all supplies you have or can get hold of. Then involve the group in menu-making, the fussy eaters in particular. Make your point clear: out of this stuff, what do you suggest we cook for the next few mornings/nights? In a group of equals (in terms of responsibility for the outcome of the trip), such as a group of friends, I would not go beyond this basic sharing of responsibility. If you are in charge (of a group of kids, or of your clients on a tour), you've assumed responsibility for them, but your situation might be alleviated by a previous contract (of whatever degree of formality) with them or their parents: if you said earlier that such and such food will be served at such and such intervals, then you simply proceed as planned. If your charges are so picky that they are unable to sustain their strength for the tour, you can try preparing meals that consist of two or more different courses or parts (such as, steamed ham and pea mash). Then you offer each person to partake of either or both, and help themselves to bread as accompaniment. Do not give any "substitutes" to those who do not opt for either of your courses. (Consider occasionally giving a small dessert to those who do, if they are kids.) Further, if they are kids in your charge, drinks can help in terms of giving some extra kick for the day and also creating team spirit. On a cold morning, hot cocoa or ginger tea with honey can work wonders. 

How long can you leave a synthetic sleeping bag in compressed its stuff sack before you lose insulation? 2 days? 2 weeks? 2 months? The manufacturers say "long periods", but don't define it. 

2000 calories is the "standard" daily diet amount, so I usually shoot for 3000 calories per day plus 1 to 3 extra days, in case I get delayed or distracted and want or need to stay out longer. And I usually pack out some food. 

More insulation. Stay dry inside. Make sure you wear something that lets sweat escape. Keep your head covered with a hat and, if possible, a mask or balaclava. Eat plenty of food. When you stop, you will probably want to be doing something, stand at a fire, or get in your sleeping bag. It's hard to just stand around in sub-zero weather without getting cold. 

I prefer multiple gas lighters. They're light, they don't leak (and even if they do they don't make a mess), and they're cheap. If you buy one for a safety back up and leave it in the cellophane, you'll always have a dry one if you need it. 

First, pick the location you think it closest to the mark, based on the GPS. Then, walk in an outward spiral, looking at any place that someone would be likely to hide a geocache. Think like a person who is hiding it. Where would you put it? Don't forget to look up. Maybe it's at eye level or above. If you wander around randomly, you'll end up walking over the same places over and over. If you force yourself into a pattern, you'll see things you would not otherwise. 

If the bear is eating, let it eat. If you try to scare it off it may defend its food. If it just wanders up to your campsite, then you can make some noise to try to scare it away. But don't get too close.
