It's possible this guy was offering a low number because he doesn't value your type of work, but it could also be because he doesn't have the funding to do otherwise. Of course, if he's not offering any sort of equity then it's still a shitty deal (since one day he might sell this thing and cash out for millions and you'll still have your lowballed salary). But to echo the others no you didn't do anything wrong. Some people can't afford a pay cut or don't want to. Some people will take a pay cut in exchange for stock options or something. You don't sound like you want to either so be glad you dodged a bullet because if this is how he handles simple hiring practices then I can't imagine he'll stay in business long. 

I agree with the consensus here that the client acted poorly. However, one additional detail that I latched on to in your story 

You already have some excellent answers above, but I'm going to make one additional observation/suggestion. You have what sounds like a standard issue full time flat salary job. I've got one. Most people on this board have one. And judging by your statements you seem to be wanting to get paid more as a result. Or rather, you don't want to be working those extra hours for free. It sounds like the same thing but the added wrinkle is that compensation comes in forms other than money. I don't know what your financial situation or commitments are but it sounds like you'd be a pretty good fit for a startup culture. Crazy long hours, beyond-Puritan work ethic, deep personal investment in the company, it sounds like the sorts of things people in startups go through. Not to sound cliche but this is the sort of thing the guys on Shark Tank look for. The downside though is that startups frequently pay a lot less than standard full time jobs for established companies, and there's almost never any such thing as overtime pay. You would likely be taking a very substantial pay cut to join one, and this is why you tend to see younger people flocking towards them (i.e., people who maybe haven't yet entered into a marriage/mortgage/family situation). The perk though is that you are frequently offered stock options or ownership in the company as a result (sometimes called "sweat equity"). Back in the day people would work for Microsoft for $30k/year in Seattle and stock options. When Microsoft hit it big they cashed out and became millionaires. Of course that's assuming the startup succeeds. So it's a gamble. But it's an option. 

I am currently leaving my job. I have a short period of notice and I've put my employer in a uncomfortable spot. When I did this, he quickly asked me if I had a reference for him. Refering someone for an interview, especially if it's a good fit, is something generally apreciated by employers and ease the tensions. It is possible your employer is so angry that he may react irrationally (you have to figure this out) but most likely he will end up respecting your decision and accept that you help him to find a replacement. 

I'd say in case you are accepted, just respect legal period of notice and politely say goodbye to your old team. It's never easy to quit a job in this situation, but it's part of a company life to handle turnover. I was in the exact same situation few weeks ago : working in a small team, quitting, lots of planned work etc. but they found a promising replacement even though they had high expectations (finding quickly a cheap autonomous dev ready to work overtime). It's advisable to finish in good terms, by extending the notice period as much as your next employer would accept and/or suggesting a competent replacement if you know any, but thinking about yourself is higher priority. The company will recover. Good luck for the interview ! 

I had the same issue when building my CV, and solved it using a "speciality" line. Typically, your job title would look like 

I would say if you live in an area with lots of tech jobs and lots of recruiters, just stop answering your phone when this guy calls. The odds are when you do need a job again, he will still be plenty glad to talk to you. Or he won't be doing this anymore. But either way unless he's the only recruiter in the area don't worry about burning bridges. In my experience the only thing that would piss off a recruiter bad enough to not work with you is if they placed you in a position and you never show up so they never get their commission (thinking commission-based recruiters here, not flat-fee ones). 

Something to add: there's a local large tech company in my area where the employees have an old saying, "it's the best first and third job you'll ever have" Meaning: there's rules in place on how large your salary can be and how much you can be promoted to that apply to existing employees, but not necessarily to people hired from the outside. For example, you might make $50k and your manager wants to promote you to a position where you can make $100k. However, the company has a rule: no more than a 50% pay increase. Which means you can't be raised to more than $75k. Crestfallen, you take a different job outside the company that offers you, say, $85k which is still less than the $100k you should have been promoted to but better than the $75k you were actually promoted to. After a few years though your original manager approaches you and can now successfully offer you the $100k because now you're no longer a current employee and so he can give you what the position deserves. It may sound stupid, and in the short run it probably costs the company some good employees, but in the long run it saves money (which is good for the accountants, stock holders, etc.) It also has one added benefit: it helps curtail the notion that managers can give giant raises to people they like based on things other than skill. I once worked a job at a company that didn't have this rule and we got a new director of our division one day and he brought in his crew of fellow coworkers from his old division and gave them all management positions with enormous raises and bonuses, despite their complete lack of qualifications. You can probably guess what happened next. So anyway the bottom line is that yes this is a thing, yes it may be antiquated or not properly account for highly demanded talent or what not but thems the breaks. You have to decide if you like the job or money more. 

I don't think it is a very important fact for them to know, so I wouldn't mention it. Either they already know that fact because they remember you as a potential recruit, either they don't and recalling them you applied several times may make them think they had reasons not to hire you before. Instead, use your knowledge of the company for a good, targetted cover letter. Insist on your motivation and explain why you applied several times before. 

Same thing goes for more operational roles. You understimate the satisfaction you can get out of tech roles probably because you had bad experience with them, but they are full of interesting challenges. Now, that doesn't mean you should be a tech, it really depends of your own ability at it and what would be your ideal career plan. In my opinion, you should avoid dead ends, not because of the pay, but simply because it's better to have options to change your job if get bored (and this is very likely to happen IMHO) than seeking the perfect job right on start. 

As others answer provided, there is no such thing as being unprofessional for checking the documentation especially considering you are junior, especially considering programming is vast and there is always a detail you can forget and you have a mission for your code to be correct. There is however cases I would consider being documentation abuses. I have a collegue who is sometimes unable to come up with his own solution about a given problem. Therefore, he sometimes proceed on checking the web about how to solve his problem. Last time, for example, he checked how a web framework was architecturing validators and error counters because he had a seemingly similar feature to design. This is a case where what you are looking for is far too abstract for the Internet to help you. Worse, you could find solutions that seemingly fit, but in fact don't, because they are applied to a different use case. By trying to grab some premade code/architecture/pattern he would have more or less injected code in our base that may have worked, but would be hard to maintain because written by someone else for a different purpose. I don't look the documentation often because I write code that uses mostly core language features (no framework) and I am gifted with a reliable memory when it comes to code, but I do use the doc everytime I'm stuck on something trivial. However, if I'm stuck on something higher level, the good thing to do is to seek help from a more experienced collegue, you will get a much better answer. 

I agree with the others in that you need to present the case properly, and also that if you're trying to help your company after you leave but they won't take your suggestion then it's no longer your problem. You tried. That said the one thing every company and department understands: money. I mean, money is I'm guessing the reason they won't buy the software (your question's wording is a little vague so I'm guessing about this part). And if it's cheaper to have people on staff to do the job than it would be to buy the software to automate their tasks then yeah, they're going to go that route, it's the most finanically rational. However if this isn't the case, if it would be better and cheaper to use the software then that's your angle. Same way if you had to write a video game it may be cheaper to license a game engine than it would be to hire a team of people to write it over however long it takes. Barring some sort of "not invented here" directive (justified or not) the way to make your case is money. If the issue is no one's going to do your job once you leave then explain how much money they're going to lose when things go wrong versus the costs of buying the software. 

If you've automated yourself out of a job, your company needs to find more jobs for you to automate your way out of.
