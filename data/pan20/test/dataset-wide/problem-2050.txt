I've been a software contractor for years and often end up in a similar situation - interviewing for several roles and you're waiting on your preferred choice before declining another offer. When I was younger I would have told a white lie in this situation because I would have felt awkward saying to a recruitment person that I had another preference or turning down an offer after all the work to get to that stage. But I've learnt that it works out better if you're honest. Even if you end up taking the 3rd ranked job they will appreciate your honesty with them. Also it means should something happen (like you need another round with job preference 1 or it's postponed) you can go back and tell them honestly why it will be even longer before you make a decision. You will not the be the first or the last person who will have turned down a job at the final offer stage. It happens more than you think. You're not doing anything wrong. You're not gaming anyone to get a better rate. Recruitment is a process where they know they're competing with other employers to get that employee as much as potential employees are competing for the job. 

My advice would be: keep private conversations and work conversations separated by using the work mail account only for work-related conversations and use your private account if you want to "chat" with your co-workers. Thus its clear when you write as employee red-shield and when as private red-shield 

Not necessarily. If he is self-aware of his errors then you need to encourage him. Tell him that besides those things you mentioned in your post, he does a good job and that he can improve on that (of cause only if this is the case). I would second the answer from @The Snark Knight that you should not force everything on him at once but one thing at a time. Be sure, however, that this aspect is understood and well demonstrated. 

In general it looks bad to go from director to developer in the same company. If you were going from Billy Bob's Software House to Amazon or Google then you would consider the role as a whole rather than just the title. If the company valued you and this was purely about politics, then they could have approached this by creating a role above you, CTO, possibly renaming your role to Head of Development or just keeping it as Chief Architect. Plenty of companies have CTO's who are more business focused and CA's who do the real thinking. Frankly, it sounds as if the company doesn't value you. So a hard question - are you good at your job, or do you just think you are? How do your skills really stack up. You're in software, there's more demand than supply, so if you are as good as your question indicates then dump this firm and move on. 

You would be much better served using colleagues as references, rather than bosses. This might not work in your situation. In that case, you might be better off using references from a previous job where the skills aren't relevant but the reference could speak to your professional attitude and your skills in THAT position. On the resume, there is no need to list individual references with work experience. I would suggest breaking these sections apart, or using a line such as "References available on request" in the footer. This answer applies to situations where your bosses might not like you for any reason. Neck tattoos, whatever. A prospective employer will understand that you aren't particularly willing to use an existing employer as a reference. 

What you are talking about is more regularly called freelance work. As Joe says in his answer, you're competing with others who can do it cheaper. It's a race to the bottom if you're competing on nothing more than price. Contract work, which I've seen more often in IT than anywhere else is where a firm will hire a rather than a permanent member of staff. In the UK, the contractor will typically have their own company as a tax vehicle and will invoice the firm through their company. This is more tax efficient for both the company and the contractor. The downsides are that you are not employed directly by the company (no benefits), can be terminated very easily, won't get any paid time off (as you'll be billing per hour / day), usually have no career path in the firm, and (in theory) might be out of work while looking for your next contract. I've been an IT contractor for a number of years and I do that instead of becoming a permie solely because I find the market for what I do to be short on supply, so I get more money with little of the downsides. Whether you should consider that depends on what you do. The more commodity based your work the less advantageous it is I would say. 

Order: him to do things: here he needs guidance on what and how things should be done. Explain: why things should be done like this Participate: Check if your guidelines are met. discuss with him/the team if and how they should improve Delegate: This phase is IMHO not applicable in this case. 

What you will need is time and patience with him. Which might ease your and his pain is to create a 4 phases model (i only know the German term and didn't find any English links) 

Most company will use this phrase just to indicate, that they keep your resume for their records. From personal experience I can tell you that I had one case, where the interview went well, wasn't hired but got a call a few months later to assess if I might still be interested in the position. My conclusion would be, it highly depends on the company or HR person who is in charge. 

If you feel there might be an ethical violation, I would avoid the position. Understanding fully that you are in a financial predicament, this can often further lead a person to compromise ethics. Personally, I wouldn't want to be put in this position. As with any job, looks like you want to do more research on the company before accepting a position. In this case, it would be wise to do research on the industry as a whole. 

You could do your "hobby" programming under a pseudonym, by which it is unlikely anyone would ever know or care. If you had some sort of commercial aspirations this probably wouldn't work out. This is horrible legal advice, and you shouldn't take it as advice. Ultimately it's your employer that has a contract that oversteps what I would consider to be reasonable. 

As someone who is starting his career as part-time coder, I will try to gie you some insight on how I would like someone would approach me about such topics. 

For every task or standard check, in which phase you would but him and act accordingly. Be aware that some people won't necessarily proceed to the next phase. A general note which is totally opinion based and shouldn't be taken as an offensive. I think you missed a great opportunity with him when you let him slack the noncritical tasks because if you would have thought him back then, you wouldn't need to struggle now. When a new employee joins your team make sure you set the standard from the beginning. 

Start the dialog with the new boss, and let them come to you. If you can identify their management style, you can somewhat anticipate the best approach. If a boss is not as technical as their subordinates, it will make more sense to acknowledge this and let them ask questions to see how deep they want to go. My advice boils down to: be outgoing and helpful. Let them know you can help them with whatever questions they need. A good manager should be able to figure out what questions they need to ask to manage a team. As other have said, let them settle in. If you never get asked questions regarding processes, etc. then it may make sense to be more forthright with your opinions and suggestions. I would say a lack of questions is a red flag for a new manager.
