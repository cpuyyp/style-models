Not at all a dumb question, but actually you can see distant galaxies with the naked eye. From the northern hemisphere, the Andromeda Galaxy, our biggest neighboring galaxy, is visible if you know where to look, and is at a reasonably dark place. From the southern hemisphere, the two smaller, but nearer, irregular galaxies called the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds are visible. The reason that more distant galaxies are not visible, is due to the inverse-square law: As the light particles (photons) recede from the galaxy (or any other light source), they are distributed over an ever-increasing surface. That means that a detector (e.g. your eye) of a given area will catch less photons, the farther it is placed from the galaxy. The law says that if in a time interval Δt on average it detects, say, 8 photons at a distance D, then in the same time interval, at a distance 2D it will detect 8/22 = 2 photons. At a distance of 4D, it will detect 8/42 = 0.5 photons. Or, equivalently, it will need twice the time to detect a single photon. The bottom line is that in principle you can see the very distant galaxies, but the photons are so few and arrive so rarely, that your eye is not a good enough detector. The benefit of a telescope is that 1) it has a larger area than your eye, and 2) you can put a camera at its focal point instead of your eye and take a picture with a large exposure time, i.e. increasing the Δt. 

If they all had the same velocity along the LOS, the plot you show would be a thin line; instead it is smeared out. Due to mass being concentrated in the center, there's a steep increase in velocity at low $x$. If there were only the mass you can see, the velocity would decrease at larger $x$ due to the larger distance from the central mass. The reason it stay more or less constant is thought to be the extra, invisible mass known as dark matter. The reason the left side of the plot is similar to the right, but mirrored not only across the $y$ axis but also the $x$ axis, is that on this side, the stars move toward you, while on the right side they move away from you. The whole galaxy evidently moves away from you at $500\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, since this is the velocity at $x=0$. So, to recap: How do you generate such a plot? You measure the distribution of velocities along many lines of sight in the galactic plane, from one side ($-R_\mathrm{gal}$) to the other ($+R_\mathrm{gal}$). For instance, at $x=14\,\mathrm{kpc}$, you'd measure $V=675\pm12\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$: 

$^\dagger$For a universe, at least. For a roadkill, it might be equivalent. $^\ddagger$For instance, space "bends" enough around a massive cluster of galaxies to make gravitational lenses. 

The extinction is here given in terms of "cross section per hydrogen atom", but you can just think of it as an average dust grain cross section. The colors show the ultraviolet (purple) and infrared (red) regions of the spectrum. You can see that the extinction, or the cross section, is largest for UV photons, and as you go to longer wavelengths, the cross section decreases sharply and is very small in the far infrared ($\lambda \gtrsim 30 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$; the exact definitions depend on your field of interest). This is what your statement refers to. But in fact it's badly phrased, because the optical depth is also a function of density and distance, so for instance for a distance $r = 1 \, \mathrm{cm}$ through a dust cloud, the optical depth is $\ll1$ for all photons. 

The Gunn-Peterson trough is a feature in the spectrum of a (background) source near the Lyman $\alpha$ line, caused by a high density of intervening, neutral hydrogen (HI). The background source may be a quasar, but could also be e.g. a gamma-ray burst or just a regular galaxy with a strong Ly$\alpha$ line. Absorption vs. scattering The cross section of hydrogen for Ly$\alpha$ photons is quite large, so the mean free path of the photons is very small. Because Ly$\alpha$ excites hydrogen to the first excited level, the electron can only fall back to the ground state again, emitted another Ly$\alpha$ photon, in another direction. Hence, hydrogen doens't absorb Ly$\alpha$ photons, but rather scatters them. Inside the (host) galaxy, the HI density is so large that Ly$\alpha$ is all the time scattered both into and out of the LOS. However, when the photons escape the galaxy and enters the circum- and intergalactic medium (IGM), the density decreases. Along the LOS to the galaxy, a photon hitting a hydrogen atom is "lost", and no new photons are added to the observed flux, so effectively, it becomes an absorption process rather than a scattering process. The figure below (from Laursen 2010) illustrates this phenomenon: the three photons are initially emitted in random directions, but end up traveling toward the observer on the right. On their way through the IGM, two of them are scattered out of the line of sight (LOS), and the probability of a photon from another galaxy being scattered into the LOS is negligible. 

Dust absorbs stellar light (primarily in the ultraviolet), and is heated up. Subsequently it cools by emitting infrared, "thermal" radiation. Assuming a dust composition and grain size distribution, the amount of emitted IR light per unit dust mass can be calculated as a function of temperature. Observing the object at several different IR wavelengths, a Planck curve can be fitted to the data points, yielding the dust temperature. The more UV light incident on the dust, the higher the temperature. The result is somewhat sensitive to the assumptions, and thus the uncertainties are sometimes quite large. The more IR data points obtained, the better. If only one IR point is available, the temperature cannot be calculated. Then there's a degeneracy between incident UV light and the amount of dust, and the mass can only be estimated to within some orders of magnitude (I think). If lines from various atomic or molecular transitions are seen as well, the composition can be better constrained. The size distribution can be determined from fitting the theoretical spectrum of a given distribution to observed dust spectra. This information is often not available in a given high-redshift galaxy, so here we can be forced to assume that the dust is similar in nature to "local" dust, i.e. in the Milky Way and our nearest neighbors. If you're interested in the relevant equations, they can be found many places, e.g. here. Another way to estimate the dust mass is to measure the metallicity of the gas with which the dust is is mixed, either from emission lines or absorption lines if a background source is available. The dust mass is then found from an assumed dust-to-metals ratio, which is pretty well-established in the local Universe, and to some extend also at higher redshifts. 

The terms refer to the viewing angle, i.e. from which direction do we observe a (disk) galaxy. If we happen to be located roughly in its plane of rotation, we see it from the "edge", whereas if we are more or less above or below its plane, we see its "face". To make a more quantitative statement, the orientation is described by the inclination angle $i$, which is the angle away from "face-on". That is, the inclination of a galaxy that is observed face-on is $i=0$, and the inclination of a galaxy observed edge-on is $i = 90º$. For randomly oriented galaxies, the mean inclination angle will be around $i = 60º$. 

The cosmic microwave background As for you last question, the ICM doesn't interact much with the CMB, so they're not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and there's no conflict. A small fraction (<10%) of the CMB photons does interact. This doesn't change the state of the gas, but it tends to polarize a fraction of the CMB, and this we can use to study the ionization history of the Universe. EDIT: I forgot about the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is the interaction of hot electrons with CMB photons. Rob Jeffries discusses this in his answer. 

Yes indeed, the Sun (and other stars) has an oscillatory velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane. According to this Nature article, the Sun crosses the galactic plane roughly every 30 million years, reaching a max height of 150-300 lightyears. Depending on how you measure it, a more recent analysis by Joshi (2007) finds that we are currently somewhere between 20 and 90 lightyears above the plane. 

The Hubble law gives the velocity of a distant galaxy right now. A galaxy at a distance $d$ recedes at a velocity $v = H_0\,d$ right now$^\dagger$. However, the relation between $d$ and the redshift — which is the quantity that we observe — is a non-trivial function of the expansion history of the Universe, obtained by integrating the (inverse) scale factor over time, which in turn depends on the densities of matter, radiation, and dark energy. Analogy Paint dots on a rubber band, hold onto one end, and let your friend walk away with the other end. It doesn't matter whether your friend changes pace, maybe even stops and walks toward you for a while, then starts sprinting away from you. At any given time, the velocity of a given dot with respect to you is simply proportional to its distance from you. 

As noted by KenG, the fact that $H$ decreases with time may seem at odds with the accelerated expansion of the Universe. But $H$ describes how fast a point in space at a given distance recedes. Later, that point will be farther away, and so will recede faster. From the definition of the Hubble parameter, $H\equiv\dot{a}/a$, multiplying by the scale factor shows the acceleration $da/dt$:
