Change the home page for a team site to a new page I created - e.g. from default.aspx to Shared%20Documents\newhome.aspx Edit the layout of default.aspx for this site only. 

I administer a Sharepoint 2007 site. All the following occur for any user, including the farm admin user, so I am assuming this has nothing to do with permissions. On one document library only, the Name field is missing from the Edit Properties page for each document. Folders are fine. This means that users with permissions to edit or delete from the site are unable to rename documents. If I navigate to the document library via the UNC path, I can use the Windows UI to rename documents without any problem. The Name field is implicit in Document Libraries - you can't add or remove it as a column either via Content Type or the Document Library columns. Any ideas what I can do to allow users of this doc library to be able to rename documents? Update: This document library is not using a custom editform.aspx page. 

By adjusting the packet size, you can figure out what the mtu for the link is. This will represent the lowest mtu allowed by any device in the path, which could be your switch, your computer, target or anything else inbetween. This won't by itself tell you where the lowest MTU is - you may be able to work that out by running the test to different devices in the path, but there could always be transparent routers that limit the MTU but don't show up for . Note there is an overhead of 28 bytes for the ICMP headers, so the MTU is 28 bytes larger than the figure you establish through the method above. So to check for MTU of 9000, you actually need to set your ping packet size to 9000-28 = 8972. Update I found some resources which will specifically figure out the MTU across the path between the host and the target: 

Content in other pages is still stored in SQL Server, so unless Microsoft specifically designed it this way (anything seems possible with Sharepoint), I don't see why it would matter. I'd also be interested to know if it does. 

I've managed to get certificates onto an Android running FroYo by emailing the cert to an address the phone can access. Opening the attached certificate from the mail client resulted in installation. Unfortunately, Android FroYo doesn't properly support Cisco VPN, so I didn't get a sucessful test however - but the certs certainly appeared to be there. 

Your clients send mail using an smtp server - presumably that is this postfix server. Outgoing mail gets passed through Postfix's smtp transport, and the config above is passing that all through amavisd via the content_filter - so I think your outbound mail is getting processed already. I suggest you test to satisfy yourself whether this is the case. If the server is not very busy you tail your maillog, and watch what happens when you send a test message containing the GTUBE string (). Amavisd/spamassassin should catch the message. If so then you know your mail is being scanned on the way out. 

When a web server receives a request ending in a / it will serve the default page as in the configuration or default. You can configure this in an .htaccess file or in the core config for Apache, using the DirectoryIndex directive. There is also a directive DirectorySlash that specifies whether to serve the index file when requesting a directory name. If you turn this off then you may see an autoindex page instead. Apache recommend that you don't turn this off without a good reason. To be on the safe side, always include the trailing / or link specifically to the intended index file for the directory. If you are using a different web server, please update your question. 

I think you will need to migrate all the content to a new team site based on one of the WSS templates. This new team site needs to be in a Site Collection that is based on WSS template, and using a separate Content Database - you'll then join that Content Database to your WSS Farm. Once you have your new Team Site, you can save your Document Libraries as templates, with the content included, then create new Document libraries based on these templates. With any luck WSS will handle the MOSS columns gracefully. If not, perhaps you can just delete them. Any content based on Pages you will probably have to manually recreate as web part pages in the WSS team site. Once you have this working ok, you detach the Content DB from the WSS farm, and attach it to the MOSS farm. I think this is worth trying. It may also be possible to change the template a site is based on, which may work too, but I think requires some programming skill. 

Wireshark seems overkill if you are just testing the network. would work, at its simplest just running a set number of pings during your test and then analysing the results, or going a bit futher writing a small programme that runs the test on a schedule and then saves the data into a CSV file. You could run this between any two nodes on your network you want to test latency between. If you are looking for total latency for the programme then you will need something different. I wouldn't trust wireshark and synced clocks to test this, since you will be looking for milisecond differences that may not show up accurately between two different hosts on the same network. 

There are a couple of ways of achieving this. Simplest way is to create another Directory entry for the subdirectory with AuthType set to None like this: 

If you are trying to deploy Windows Server 2008 via disk, then you will need the original installation media, or a copy of it. You can then boot from this to do a standard install. As this seems like a pretty obvious answer, I assume you want to further customise your installs. To do that you'll need a tool like System Center Configuration Manager (not free) or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (free I believe) or Windows Automated Installation Kit (free).

It depends. You can configure different SMTP connectors to accept incoming mail in different ways depending on how it is configured. For example, your public facing one might only accept mail sent to valid addresses on your domain. Your internal one is there for your internal mail clients to send mail, and only accepts from a valid user, computer, or internal IP addresses, or all of the above. You also have the option to enforce complex passwords for all accounts, to mitigate against dictionary attacks. I would do this in addition to the above. You could also have further protection by having all your incoming mail come in via a spam filtering service, and only accept external SMTP connections from the service providers servers. 

I can't find any reference to this only applying to pages stored in the Pages library in Microsoft's documentation. What Microsoft says is: 

You wouldn't have root privileges if you did this. Perhaps you need to discuss what specific privileges you all need, and then acheive these without root. Of course, someone will need to have the root privilege - that could be the VPS admin at the hosting company I suppose. 

There isn't a ternary operator (e.g. ?:) in bash, so you are stuck with your if, then construct over multiple lines. You could use a different language that does have a ternary operator (PERL for example). Mind you, a lot of folk discourage use of ternary operators as they aren't as easy to read in code - in other words, your comments end up longer than the multiple lines of code would have been. I doubt there is a performance benefit of either method.
