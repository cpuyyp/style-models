Are women weak in religion No idea, other than to note that some religions deny women the opportunity to become priests or theologians. Some cultures deny women the right to an education, which might make it difficult for them to demonstrate religious knowledge or expertise. Are women weak in reasoning 

It appears to have been discovered by a team including members from the sugar industry. They were looking for ways to use sucrose as a chemical intermediate. Most synthetic processes involve multiple steps. I have not found what (if any) final product was in mind. I can find no evidence that any of the participants were engaged in insecticide research. I can find no evidence that Tate & Lyle, usually characterised as a sugar business, would have been aiming to synthesize an insecticide from sugar. 

Treatment as "Practise Medicine" For the purposes of this answer I will interpret "treat humans" as "practise medicine" as I believe the latter is the relevant term in the UK which corresponds most closely with the intent of the question. Qualifications for Vets The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons say 

Experiments in pair-bond stability in domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica) As you might expect (?) - it's complicated 

It is unclear and may depend on how you define chemical weapons. Battle of Okinawa, 1945 The weapons used include 

No they haven't, nor have they claimed so. Precis The journalist or editor didn't do their job correctly and made a mistake. The figure refers to particulates, not to other important emissions and not to all emissions. Important emissions As others have noted, important tailpipe emissions include gases like CO2 which manufacturers quote figures for because governments impose taxes based on those emissions. At least in the UK, manufactures brochures always give the CO2 emissions in g/km 

It doesn't. Assuming we're talking about the typical turbocharger fitted to many current models of fairly ordinary car. 

There was no explosion The "explosion" story is most likely a very recent fictional elaboration of a very old "leaking coffin" story. It may be a conflation of this story with stories about the death of William the Conqueror. No explosion, alleged leakage of fluid from a split lead-coffin in transit two weeks after death. The earliest known reporter of the leaking coffin story, Gilbert Burnet, seems a little skeptical of it. He says the older accounts were embellished to appeal to the weak-minded. Modern students of history seem to regard the story as of doubtful authenticity, perhaps having been fabricated. 

Apparently yes. The Effectiveness of Coerced Treatment for Drug-Abusing Offenders - Federal Probation, June 1998 (direct PDF download) 

I did find that the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery published AAFP and ISFM Feline Environmental Needs Guidelines Sarah L H Ellis et al. DOI: 10.1177/1098612X13477537 Which seems a reasonably comprehensive guide to what a domesticated cat needs but which doesn't mention the provision of TV based audiovisual stimulation. 

The source you quote doesn't support St Jerome's claim. So you could probably drop "and never remarry" part of the question title. 

In 1940 Britain spent £643 million on defence Adding any sum similar to 25,000 to the existing 643,000,000 defense expenditure was almost certainly not going to shorten the war noticeably. It seems unlikely that Churchill was really faced with an important choice between the two. 

There is no indication that this handshake commits the Democratic Party and the Republican party to a strong alliance. Overall conclusion The image in the question is a sloppy piece of propaganda that relies on fabrication, false identification and an exaggerated interpretation of the meaning of handshakes between politicians. 

There are reports that some more recent missiles for surface to air use do have a command-destruct capability. 

Probably not, many have looked for such data without success. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is often used to record causes of death. This has some codes for electrocution but they do not distinguish deaths due to design of plug or outlet from deaths due to faults in cables or equipment for example. 

Further to Articuno's answer. This is part of an inscription where one king's name was later overwritten with another's. 

If the ridiculousness of this (in the context of fingerprint scanners) is not evident to anyone reading this, please say so in a comment. Conclusion (what follows is personal opinion - you can disregard it) Whatever the hazards (if any) of fingerprint scanners - this article is, on the whole, not credible. It is probably a good example of the worst kind of journalism. It seems to deliberately stir up concern and even panic, prey on peoples natural apprehensions about new technologies and does not make any attempt to give the makers of the devices any opportunity to respond to the claims. For the sake of it's citizens, I hope it is untypical of journalism and science in Saudi Arabia. 

The quotation is bogus and there may not have been much to cut. There's no evidence that Churchill said this According to the Telegraph the quotation is bogus. 

The Human body has an average density of 1062 kg/m3 ‡ This is why (most) humans float in the Dead Sea without any swimming effort and do not sink. Lighter forms of crude oil would support the human body less, this can make staying afloat difficult or impossible. Buoyancy depends on the weight of the volume of displaced fluid compared to the weight of the object displacing the fluid. To stay afloat you have to provide a swimming force that is equal to the force of gravity on the mass difference. The greater the deficit in density, the greater force you have to provide, at some point this force exceeds that which a human can provide for any significant time. Oxygen Lighter forms of crude oil should have a greater proportion of volatile hydrocarbons. The vapours of these hydrocarbons will displace air at the surface of the oil and make it difficult or impossible to obtain oxygen by breathing. Reports In general, oil on seawater (for example) quickly spreads into a thin film, so buoyance may not be an issue. But the difficulties in swimming and breathing can be potentially fatal Man rescued from drowning in China oil spill Engineer drowns in crude oil storage tank 

No Corroboration (yet?) So far there has been no report of a police statement or coroner's verdict confirming the details of the allegation - that I can find.

It is doubtful that there is much correlation. Cows lie down too often for other reasons to be a useful predictor of rain. Cows lie down a lot Cows are ruminants and lie down to chew their cud. They also lie down for other reasons including sleep. Cows lie down perhaps up to sixteen times a day. At any given time there is a 50% chance a cow will be lying down but they tend to stand up more in hot weather and perhaps tend to lie down more in cold weather. Confirmation Bias We humans tend to find significance in coincidences and, if primed by knowledge of this adage, might have stronger recall of occasions when cows were seen lying down prior to rain than for occasions when cows were seen lying down prior to no rain or when cows were seen standing up prior to rain. We like our old adages Some frivolous media have speculated that air temperatures often drop before rain and that this therefore supports the old adage. It is notable that the study they cite says no such thing and is more focused on heat-stress. References 

So it is true that public funding is not proportionate to tax revenue. It was never intended to be. However this question grossly oversimplifies a very complex situation and is likely to solicit debate, arguments and continued discussion. 

As well as flamethrowers and "chemical smoke", according to this account, the US army used phosphorus grenades

The evidence for therapeutic effects of very low powered lasers is weak and there is history of deliberate deception by makers of these devices. It is notable that laser pointers can be bought for $5 but laser therapy devices can cost $750. See A Skeptical Look at Low Level Laser Therapy by Stephen Barrett, M.D.

There are several sign-languages used in South Africa, but the one most likely to be used at official events may be South African Sign Language (SASL), which probably has more in common with British Sign Language (BSL) than with American Sign Language (ASL). This might partly explain why some ASL experts are so baffled by what they saw. It doesn't explain why many South Africans believe Thamsanqa Jantjie's sign language is incomprehensible or nonsense.
