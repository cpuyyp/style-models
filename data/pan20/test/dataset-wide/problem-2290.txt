I tend to tuck mine inside my outer layer of clothing if it's cold but dry. This keeps the lenses warm so avoids condensation. It helps with camera battery life too. 

Hydrogen gas doesn't spontaneously ignite, but does burn in air over a wide range of concentrations. It's also ready to ignite with a spark. So although you may be able to start a fire with one, the source you quote is almost irrelevant on that fact. Hydrogen can also be given off when charging lead acid batteries - not a hot process indicating that has generation is independent of temperature. If you did want to start a fire using one, the most effective way would probably be to use as designed, redirecting the gas towards your tinder, and try to ignite it with a spark. Any air caught in the heater could allow for a possible explosion so it may not be a good idea. Flashback may also be a worry. 

When these first came out, they had a tendency to fail at the hinges, especially in the wind. While the leading makes have probably dealt with this to some extent, not all makes will have. And this can mean more failures than you carry spare hinges, in one go. A permanent repair can be easy or hard depending on the hinge/clip design,and a field splint is likely be harder for a failure at a joint than in the middle of a section. For the smaller ones, not being able to split the weight between two people in a disadvantage. Even for tents that would only be used for car camping, having all the weight and bulk in one lump can be awkward especially in a small car. They also tend to be bulkier to pack than an equivalent conventional tent. When pitching in even a light wind, putting in 2--3 pegs on the upwind side before the tent has any height can be a huge help, especially if you're on your own. If the poles automatically lock together when you spread the fabric, this will be harder. Against that you can offset the extra weight of the poles, so you should be able to find your own workaround. The clips used to be annoying to find and undo when taking the tent down, so the total up+down time wasn't necessarily much shorter unless you were tall enough to reach the high clips first. Again this may have improved. Having said all that, it might sound like I'm against self-erecting tents. We plan to give them a good look when buying our next car-camping family tent, as being able to put the tent up single handed is a big deal, and we drive a windbreak and plan to camp in decent weather. If you arrive home with a wet tent, being able to hang it up without poles is useful. 

I agree that the sources on the internet for the GRs (grandes randonnées, the main long-distance trails in France) are a bit old-fashioned, and not ideal for finding routes. However here are some pointers to get you started -- I've linked to pages that might help you but the parent websites are worth a browse. In general French websites assume some familiarity with a map of France -- regions are often shown out of context -- as well as the names of the various organisational areas. france-randos.com has search facilities and the ability to browse by region and département (I started with Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence; Alpes-Maritime is another good option). In the resulting list I found the GR4. Descriptions of the GRs can be found at gr-infos.com, here I've linked to a section of the GR4. This map (link rather than inline image as no rights information given) has a nice overview of the GR network, suggesting that the GR5 might be worth a look for you. Sources on the regional GRP (grandes randonnées de pays) routes are almost by definition regional, and again hard to find online. Some regions have paper guides available. French Hiking maps of any decent scale tend to cover a fairly small area, but the 1:100 000 maps are fine for the GRs which are all waymarked on the ground as well as shown on the maps. I suggest getting hold of a few maps once you've narrowed down you search a little. If you're prepared to take a ferry from Nice, the GR20 (I mentioned in my comment) in Corsica has some excellent hiking and scenery, and you're up in the mountains within a few km of the port (as I remember from 20 years ago!). Corsica is very different from mainland France (culture and geology) and well worth a visit. 

You might just get away with highlighting white water itself and rocks. Clear water wouldn't reflect the light in the right direction. But you'd need a very bright, possibly illegal and/or dangerous laser pointer. My waterproof video camera has a 1mW approx red laser as an aiming guide. Even in a river valley on a dull day it's useless for indicating rocks. Green is much more visible for the same power, but the cheap green laser pointers I've had are dangerous junk (can massively exceed the rated power without warning when the rated power was already at the top end of what's sensible/allowed; sometimes don't turn on). This is in the UK where the whitewater session is winter and the rivers narrow. In somewhere like the alps with sunny paddling you'd have no hope. Perhaps more telling is that I've been on courses led by coaches who love having the latest gadgets and they've never used laser pointers. 

Over a small area you may be able to do something. I don't know if you have a small area to deal with, and 10ft might be pushing it even then. Basically you fix the position of a known point by some means (it might not even have to be fixed absolutely depending on your goal). Long term GPS averaging might do that for you. Then you use this known value to calibrate an offset. You'd need a laptop connected to a dedicated GPS unit and probably custom code. If you could also access differential GPS signals you'd need a beacon receiver for that, but wouldn't need the known point or your own code. But over a sufficiently small area compass triangulation can get surprisingly good relative accuracy; once again you need well-surveyed references (and line of sight to them). 

Almost all common fuels produce water when burnt, as they're made up of hydrocarbons. That is to say the hydrogen in them combines with oxygen to form water. The extreme example is methane, which has 4 hydrogen atoms to one carbon In a completely sealed but poorly insulated space (an approximation to a tent with all vents closed) an equilibrium will be reached as water condenses on the walls (the outside will be cooler than the inside due to the heat source. The production of water amounts for a lot of the energy released per unit mass of fuel. Eventually the process will be limited by oxygen depletion. In a completely open environment the air isn't heated appreciably - or rather the hot air convects away, taking the water vapour with it. But radiant heat is effective. That's what happens when you dry things in front of a fire. If it's raining you can often arrange your camp so that the things you need to dry are sheltered from the rain but receive radiant heat from the fire. The intermediate case is interesting: enough ventilation to carry away the combustion products and replace the oxygen (in fact to carry away the water evaporated from your wet clothes). This is clearly possible as anyone who's finished a wet hike at a pub with an open fire can confirm. The fireplace and chimney are important, as they transfer heat to the room while venting the combustion products and sucking in fresh air. A wood burning stove is similar but more efficient. Whether we could arrange such a setup in an outdoors situation is another matter. The common exception to these fuels is charcoal. It's not actually pure carbon but near enough. So next to no water is given off in burning. And that's very closely related to why it's so hazardous to burn indoors. It's not very energy dense (so you burn more), and consumes a lot of oxygen. So it rapidly depletes the oxygen in the air. But (much more so than in the case of hydrocarbon fuels) this just changes the combustion reaction to produce carbon monoxide, instead of putting the fire out. And carbon monoxide is poisonous (large quantities of carbon dioxide aren't much fun either but CO is much worse). This explains most of the warnings about not burning stuff n tents (which by the way aren't as ventilated as those I was brought up cooking in). If you burnt charcoal to dry your clothes, it would work well, but you wouldn't be in a fit state to worry about at clothes if you were breathing the same air. 

When pushing yourself hard a variety of flavours and textures is good, rather than thinking you don't fancy yet another sweetish, vaguely chewy thing. The variety including savoury stuff can be used to make it feel more like you've had a meal (2 courses even) which is quite a boost. All these have quite a long shelf life because they're low in water, so plan for plenty of water. This might include sealed containers of water, purification, or probably both, but depends on the conditions. This low water content also helps them to be energy dense. Emergency stuff is emergency stuff. Seal it up if you need to, or store the good stuff in the spare wheel well out of sight. Snacks are another matter, take them too if you need to. Check the emergency kit before heading off ivy the wilds (also check the torch batteries etc.) 

I'm always tempted to suggest that if they can put up a sign they can put up a life ring, and sometimes they do. But the rate of vandalism and theft of rescue equipment, while small, is real. Of course such equipment wouldn't be much use without someone capable of using it. So it's easier just to warn people off. The risks at many sites are high and include contamination and steep uneven banks. The policy of just warning people off only really becomes a problem when it becomes a blanket policy. There are still quite a lot of places where it's possible to swim in fresh water, but they can be a long way away. 

This is a bit of a non-answer but is probably better than a string of comments. There are some ideas in here. The problem is that you need line of sight rather than to be near a tower. You could work that out from a contour map with the towers marked - get electronically or on paper. But tower locations aren't generally published, at least not in a convenient way. You can guess at some of them, so climbing a hill that will give you line of sight to a town should work - for which you need a topographic map and some old fashioned navigation skills. A partial technical solution would be to log signal against location, to let you know the minimum backtrack to get a signal. This might get through quite a lot of battery. I know it would be possible to build such an app but I don't think one exists. An automation app I use called can report a list of cells it can see. The code names for the cells don't make it clear what network they're on, but if you're strictly considering emergency calls that won't matter. Although it's a very versatile app I don't know how you could make it log your location when cells are found, and reporting the list is a tool for building rules to preform actions when a specific cell is near. It looks like it can tell you when you've lost signal. There are apps that upload your location when they have a signal. If you could locally access a log from such an app you might be able to tell where you were when you had coverage. But you probably can't. You would still need to use your judgement about whether to go uphill to get line of sight, or backtrack. This depends on so much more than information about cell locations (such as the nature of the emergency and the weather conditions). Finally signal propagation is strange. Sometimes you'll get a good signal without line of sight because of reflections. I've even known a wooded river valley with no signal (on my network) except at the base of a particular tree beside the path, where it was weak but repeatable. 

Unless you're at high tide, walk just below the high tide line. The damp sand is firmer and easier to walk on as well as cooler. To get there, in sandals you can step vertically onto the sand and reduce contact with your toes. With bars feet, move quickly. Even if you don't have both feet off the ground by running, minimising the time they're both on the ground reduces the heat. With shoes /boots walk normally. 

The shape is the best clue you have. Buzzards' wing shape does depend on what they're doing, but if you saw a consistent difference between the known buzzards and the other birds, it's likely to be meaningful. 

When it comes to printing, there are printable vinyls for both laser and inkjet printers. Some inkjet inks run badly in the wet whatever the substrate, while others show little or no deterioration. Even on paper I intend to keep out of the rain, I prefer laser printing for outdoor use as it can try a little damp without being completely wiped out, and doesn't stain other items. The downside of the vinyls (and many of the plastic waterproof "paper" products) is that they don't fold like paper. Also they're not recyclable or biodegradable and no use for starting fires. I print gpx routes on openstreetmap mapping using a site called inkatlas, and just use normal paper, but in heavy rain in my toptube bag (on the bike) some water gets in the seams. 

You're unlikely to have to eat all your emergency rations in adverse conditions, so apart from a variety of bars I suggest : 

From what I remember, some biting insects deliver an anticoagulant . This may irritate, though it's not well studied. Others rely on not being detected, and deliver an anaesthetic. One effect that can affect how much a particular bite irritates, even for the same species, is if you knock it off leaving mouthparts behind. Of course different parts of your body have differing sensitivities to stimulus, and are also irritated differently by clothing etc. (a cuff rubbing on a bite can be particularly annoying) 

This is really just a hypothesis, but here in the UK we also get mixed wader flocks. A significant reason for large/mixed flocks to occur is predation. Watch out for what happens when a large flock of waders (almost by definition very exposed on the ground) spots a falcon. They scatter in every direction, not maintaining a straight line for any time at all. This makes it hard for the falcon to pick a target and strike. Add more birds (of any species) to the mix and it increases the confusion. It also increases the number of targets, reducing the chances of any individual bring picked off, and even the number of eyes to spot a predator. Of course, any costs of competition must be taken into account, and if the sandpipers' and plovers' food sources overlap this will be real. But there's also a cost (energy, feeding time, not looking out for predators) to chasing other birds away. This must be weighed up against the potential loss of food, especially if the smaller species may be quite persistent due to a lack of anywhere else to go. 

Terrain makes an enormous difference. I have a pair of light boots that have lasted me nearly 10 years and probably over 1000 km with many more to go (normally with a backpack, quite often over 10kg). I used to have the shoe version - identical except for the height of the ankle - as well. The sole was quite worn after a few hundred km and the only reason they got anywhere near 1000 km was that it was for lots of little walks, for which anything would do. My bag then was rarely over 5kg. The difference is that the ones that wore fast were used almost always on paved surfaces, while the long-lasting pair are used on the typical mix of hiking terrain: some rock/paving but lots of dirt. I've always found sole wear to be the limit, and can get away with almost any shoes so long as they fit properly. If you find you need a more specific sole, then wear will become much more of an issue.
