The only thing that I have a question about is how to appropriately chose what recent training run I provide. I plan to adjust the distance I'm training for, intensity, and distance per week appropriately for improvement and maintenance throughout the year as the dates for the races settle. I see a few options: 

My apartment complex gym got a new hip machine that supports four types of hip exercises - flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. I'm primarily a runner (I run 3.5+ miles three days a week, low impact cardio usually on an elliptical on the weekends), but I do strength training two days a week (3 sets of 10 reps, 70% of max) and recalibrate my max once a month. Of the four hip exercises that this machine supports, which one(s) should I be doing to best support my running? A few quick searches suggests exercising (stretching and strengthening) flexors and adductors more frequently than others, but it's kind of vague. Should I do all four, or just a subset? And would be 3 sets of 10 reps at 70% of max be suitable for this type of exercise as well? 

I've been running for a few years now, but I still struggle with speedwork. I use an online training plan generator that takes previous race time and distance, target race distance, weekly distance, and schedule duration to generate a running plan that includes easy runs, tempo runs, speedwork, and rest or cross-training days. My training plan is based on a four week cycle. Monday is an easy run, Tuesday is an easy run on weeks 1-3 and rest/XT on week 4, Wednesday is speedwork on week 1 and 3 or tempo run on week 2 or an easy run on week 4, Thursday is an easy run, Friday is rest or cross train, Saturday is long run, and Sunday is rest or cross train. The plan also builds speed throughout, across all the workouts. Distance also increases. Total weekly distances range from 22 miles/week to 35 miles/week. The plan deviates slightly at the end, close to the race. When I'm on a treadmill, I tend to adjust the plan paces based on something like this conversion chart to account for the fact it's slightly easier to run on a treadmill than outside. I rarely take a rest day, opting for strength training and/or some time on an elliptical (usually strength + 15 minutes elliptical but sometimes 30 minutes elliptical or 30 minutes arc trainer). I do tend to take the rest days as rest days early on in the plan (which is usually following a race), very late in the plan (the week or two before a race), or if I'm not feeling well for any reason to avoid pushing myself too hard. To give an idea of where I stand, my 5k PR is 29:00, my 10k PR is 1:09:51, my 15k PR is 1:57:21, and my half PR is 2:35:07. Unfortunately, last year, I was coming off an injury. I was healed before the spring, but my winter training was almost nonexistent so my times were far worse. Last years times were 32:55 for 5k (April 2016), 1:17:35 for 10k (June 2016), and 2:53:03 for a half (November 2016). Based on my training, I'm edging close to a 5k PR this coming April. My easy runs on a treadmill are recently around 10:50-11:10/mile. I could probably even push that up a little and be comfortable. I've only had the weather for one good outdoor run, and it was an easy run around 11:30/mile. My tempo runs are around 3-4 miles long and I'm running at around 9:40/mile. Even though my easy and tempo runs distances and times are projecting a near PR, my speedwork runs are terrible. Today, I was scheduled for a speedwork run that consisted of a warm up, and 5 0.5 mile intervals at 8:20/mile, each followed by a 0.25 mile recovery interval (I used a pace of about 11:30/mile), and a cooldown for a total distance of 6 miles. By the middle of the third speed interval, I was physically worn down. Am I doing something wrong in my speedwork if I'm able to complete my easy and tempo runs on plan (and sometimes better than plan), yet struggle with my planned speedwork? What can I do to specifically improve my speedwork without huge deviations from my plan which is tailored to my upcoming 5k race? Are there any modifications I can make on training days that call for speedwork? 

Well yes definitely - nutrition after a yoga session will differ with nutrition after a long distance running session. It all comes down to what your goals are for training? Are your goals fat loss, muscle gain, general health/wellbeing, training for a specific event? It also depends on the intensity of your workouts and the frequency/duration of these! 

I have been struggling to make progress in my swimming for quite a while now. Is it simply a need to eat more food to improve? I recently took 2months off swimming to assist my recovery. I want to achieve my goals in swimming, but I don't know if it is that simple to just eat more, becasue I feel like I'm already eating too much? 

Well there are a few reasons for experiencing nausea during/after exercise, most commonly the following: - Exercising on an empty stomach (may cause low blood sugar levels) - Dehydration - Overexertion - Motion sickness from abdominal exercises Your situation sounds mostly due to the abdominal exercises you are performing. This is actually not uncommon, but in saying that, it still is not exactly great for this to be occuring on a regular basis. Maybe try and focus on a stationary spot when doing your abdominal exercises, ensuring you have properly hydrated/eaten prior to your workout, and also not overexerting yourself too much - since you haven't exercised frequently for 20years, make sure you don't go out too hard, too early. Take it slowly, hydrate, eat well and good luck! 

In 2015, I ran four races of three different distances - 2 5ks (9:20/mile and 9:04/mile), a 10k (11:15/mile), and a half marathon (11:50/mile). In 2016, I'm planning on running 2-4 5ks, 1-2 10ks, a 15k, and a half marathon. I'm about to start generating my training plans for the off-season and into next year. Previously, I planned race-to-race. I did a very generic workout in the off-season, but I really need something more structured, and run-oriented, so I'm looking to start planning. Race season is April-October, so I'm starting to plan for how I'm going to train in the off-season. The training plan generator that I use takes the input of a recent race time and distance, a distance that I'm training for, an intensity level, a current distance per week, when to start the plan, when the race is, and when I long run. 

This year, I'm planning on running a 5k, a 10k, and a half marathon in 2015. The dates of the races other than the 5k haven't been announced yet. However, based on last year's dates, there will be about 2 months (9 weeks or so) between the 5k and the 10k and about 4 months (16 weeks) between the 10k and the half marathon. I'm also planning on moving from a maintenance schedule to a training schedule after the holidays, leaving me with about 12 weeks of training before the 5k. I completed a 5k last year, and have ran 10k training runs, but never competed at that distance. My official 5k time is 29:32. I'd like to get that down to 25:00 or less. I'd also like to run an official 10k of less than 1:00:00 (hopefully ~55:00) and a half marathon in ~2:30:00, if those times are reasonable. How should I manage my training? I see four obvious solutions that seem reasonable: 

They're not the most well-known ab isolation exercise, but they are documented on exrx and Icecream Fitness 5x5 recommends them as the only ab isolation needed in the routine. Does anyone know/have a reference to whether they are worth doing over regular crunches or other core work? They are a pretty fun movement. 

Despite a couple confusions, here are the answers to the questions you asked: You should absolutely not sink down to 2100 cal if you're trying to gain muscle. I don't have a source for it (I hope someone can provide a good study), but it's near impossible to gain muscle while at a caloric deficit. Considering your activity level, you will lose some body fat at 2100 calories, but you absolutely won't gain muscle. If you want to gain muscle you NEED to eat more calories than your body burns in a day. If your body is burning 2700 calories a day, you should aim for 500 more than that (3200) to gain muscle. You can eat more than that and it might help with your strength, but you will also gain more fat. You will put on some body fat while bulking up and gaining muscle naturally, this is inevitable. You can cut back down with your 2100 cal diet after that if you want to lose the body fat. 

I have access to a treadmill that has speed workouts and incline workouts. There are two types of each - intervals and ramps. In an interval, it alternates between a resting speed or resting incline and a working speed or working incline, with each interval being 1-2 minutes. In a ramp, the speed or incline starts low and increases to a maximum about half way through the workout and then starts to decrease. There's also a combination ramp that changes both speed and incline through the duration of the workout. I'm guessing that there's no one best choice - there are benefits to intervals and benefits to ramps. I typically do two treadmill workouts a week - one focusing on speed and one focusing on inclines. I'll do other easy runs or long runs on a treadmill if the weather is bad (or it's winter) or I'm crunched for time. I found some information about speed versus incline intervals and the merits of both, but it doesn't discuss speed and incline ramps where the whole workout is a build up followed by a decrease. Another article mentions "hill training" for use if outdoor areas tend to be flat (which is true for me), which sounds like incline ramp, but doesn't compare it to intervals. Another article talks about general benefits of incline training. Finally, there are many articles which suggest that you should have an incline of about 1% on a treadmill if you are training to run outdoors. How can I decide if I should do an interval or a ramp? My instinct is that I should mix them up, but I'm not sure if I should favor one or the other. Should I continue to separate speed and incline workouts or should I tend toward the ramp that increases both speed and incline? 

You should record: date, time, what specific exercises you did, reps and sets, what body parts you focused on, duration of workout, intensity of workout, your mood, your energy levels, how you felt during the workout, your eating plans, your goals for the next workout, your weight, heart rate and anything else you can think of! The more detail the better because it provides you with more of a complex picture when reviewing your past workouts and progress! 

With those new to swimming, it takes a while to build up swimming fitness, since it swimming fitness is quite different from running or any other type of sport fitness. Continue to focus on your breathing and technique, as well as ensuring you are constantly kicking. The more you swim, the better you will get and the more you will improve. Keep it up! 

I guess it basically comes down to sucking it up and getting through it! Suffice to say, there are times where tiredness may impact on athletic performance and every now and then, it may benefit from taking the session off to rest. However, as you said, you tend to feel better after your workout so use that as incentive to get through the workout! Just tell yourself that you'll workout for 10minutes, and 90% of the time, you'll be feeling good by the time you reach the 10minutes and won't want to stop. Also, create specific goals that you want to achieve to help motivate yourself to complete each workout! Best of luck! 

If you are asking if you will improve in terms of ability to climb stairs, the answer is almost definitely yes. I myself used to climb up my apartment building everyday, and found that after even a couple days my legs didn't burn as much and I was less out of breath at the top. Your body adapts fast to the work you give it regularly, so don't be surprised if after a couple weeks you find it easy. 

Try checking out $URL$ which is actually based on the exrx sheet someone else posted. It has a simple interface where you can put in the weights you can lift and it shows you where they rank in terms of untrained, novice, advanced and elite. For example, if your benchpress and overhead press are both exactly at novice, then you'll know they're strong in reference to eachother. If you lift regularly I think you'll find yourself coming back to this site and measuring how strong you are, as it's quite addictive ;) 

I'm currently training 3x a week for mainly strength and progressing fine, but I find that my rest times between sets are ridiculously long and if I don't take them, I'm not able to finish my sets.For example, on my heavy 3x5 squats, I need to rest for 5-7 minutes. This is pretty bad, but what's worse is that even my assistance work (chinups, dips) need this much rest, or else the number of reps I can do goes down. So what's the best way to improve my endurance and need less rest time? I heard cardio might help?
