I've had a look in the SSH log file and it doesn't show any errors (not even those above). Can anyone tell me what an 'error 6' is or shed any light on why this may be happening. If anyone can suggest anywhere else I can look for more clues that would be great, I seem to have reached a dead end on this one. Further to the comments below, here is the start function from the /etc/init.d/sshd file: 

I am learning the basics of linux servers so I am green. I have an Ubuntu server upon which there are websites that I have inherited. In a fit of security worry I decided to check out the ownership of the web site files. They are all 2016:sites. If I run the command 'cat /etc/group | more' I can see that the group exists. But when I run 'lastlog' the user 2016 does not appear. I started to worry that 2016 might be the username of web users connecting from the web so I set the permissions on a testfile to chmod 600, giving read permissions to only the file owner. Sure enough I could still access the file from the web. Can anyone suggest what is going on here? I tried creating a new user and giving them file ownership but then when I access the file from the web it wants me to have all directories up stream owned by the same person. Thanks 

I'm relatively new to Linux so please excuse my ignorance. I have a public web directory where I have been experimenting with the permissions to try to learn about them. I have set up a simple test.php file and set its permissions as follows: -rw --- --- Which I was expecting to mean only the owner can access the file and no other. But, I can still access this file remotely from the web and the test page shows? This is on a Red Hat web server. NOTE: The owner use is not the web access user. This worries me as I then think maybe a web user could write to the file some how (is it possible?). Any pointers would be great. I just want to makesure I understand this as it seems to me to be an important security concept. Cheers C 

We have an AD domain. We have a domain user called Snowy and a domain user called John. I am the domain admin Rob. John's PC is called JOHN-PC. My PC is called ROB-PC. I want to allow Snowy access to \JOHN-PC\C$ but not \ROB-PC\C$ I realise I can login to JOHN-PC and add Snowy to the local admin group. However I want to allow Snowy access to admin shares on multiple PCs of my choosing and so I need to do this without actually logging on to JOHN-PC or the other ones. Our AD is at 2016 level and I tried adding Snowy to various "power user" type groups (eg Key Admins) without actually making him a domain admin, which I don't want to do. Not worked. Is there a way of doing this in AD or with policies? thanks in advance Rob 

OK so I thought I would get everything back again, so I booted up the DOMAIN DC, reestablished the trust from NEW to DOMAIN both ways, but still the same thing. There are a lot more details I can go into but if someone can point me in the right direction I would be grateful. I don't know sharepoint well, and I know TFS even less! They are the 2013 version by the way. 

I believe the answer is that I had some settings in secpol.msc on the main DC as well as in group policy. I have set the secpol ones back to defaults and seems to be using the group policy ones properly on the domain PCs, including users being able to change their own passwords. 

One of the basic principles of computer security is never to run anything you don't need. I was ping for a process today when I noticed that my Ubuntu 9.04 (desktop) machine was running a git server daemon. After a quick swear, I discovered that the package had been (probably inadvertently) installed, and removing it got rid of that process (and ensured that it wouldn't be restarted later). But in other cases, I want the server package to be installed, but don't want the server daemon running. For example, I use for internal testing (it's started by specific test scripts for some applications, and listens only on localhost in those configurations) but I don't want it listening for outside connections with some random config file. (If I wanted to run one listening for outside connections, I'd configure and run it myself.) I really don't like running all sorts of random servers I don't need on Internet-exposed machines, since who knows what security holes they open up. And I prefer not to have to muck about with firewalls, since that's yet another potential source of errors and misconfigurations that can open up security holes. It's not so hard to have Unix machines configured not to start any servers unless specifically asked to do so by the admin; NetBSD (and OpenBSD, too, I think) come this way by default. How do I configure my Ubuntu systems never to start any kind of server daemon unless I specifically tell it I want it started? (Asking to have a package installed is not, in my book, asking to start a server. If it is supposed to be, it's a terrible user interface, since many package installs don't even have a server to start, so it makes it far too easy to inadvertently start a server without realizing you've done so.) EDIT: Just to make it clear, the problem is not that I want to be able to stop existing servers. The problem is that I don't want new servers started without an explicit request. This means I should be able to do any sysadmin task, such as installing a package, and be confident that no servers have started. Most responses do not address this point. 

My redhat server is crashing every three weeks or so at 4:15am ish on Sunday mornings. (well it was sundays the last two have been Thursday mornings at 4:15ish) Looking at the logs (mysql, httpd, messages) there are no clues as to why. They just seem to stop. I ran a little script to take memory readings every 15 minutes and it too stops (with normal readings) at this time. The server is remote at a provider so I can only access it via the web. I use Plesk. It appears to be a set job or something that is causing the issue. I can see nothing in crontab. So my question is...has anyone else had this and can offer advice? Failing that. Does any one know of a way to get more detailed logging than that offered by the messages file? I was thinking of a black box style recording program or maybe something as simple as an option somewhere to increase the level of reporting in the messages log. Thanks 

UPDATE (7th Dec 2010) & WARNING: I copied the files discussed below (from the /var/tmp/vi.recover directory) to my Windows PC and sacnned with ESET NOD 32. It identifed two of the file (sshd: and juno) as the Linux/RST.B virus. Not sure if it is accurate in saying that but since the machine is a development server I'm going to re-build to be safe. Hello, I am using a Red Hat server and am getting the following errors every minute in the messages file: 

When I go into the admin pages and try to change for example authentication providers on the port 80 website, I click Default, then Save and get 

I did manage to migrate the sharepoint OK. However what I couldn't do was upgrade it to SQL 2016 and Server 2016 at the same time. I provisioned a new server identical to the old one in regards to SQL and windows, but just with SP2013 not TFS. It was on the new domain. I managed to restore the SQL OK and SP works 

I have inherited a TFS server that was also hosting a sharepoint collection. I moved the server onto a new domain - let's call the old one DOMAIN and the new one NEW. All seemed to go OK - where I could find a username on DOMAIN I made TFS and sharepoint admins part of the new domain. The services (SQL, Sharepoint, TFS) now start as admins of NEW, and I had to mess around with database owners in SQL to change them too. It was all running OK so I deleted the trust from DOMAIN to NEW and closed down the last DC on DOMAIN. (That was server 2012 and NEW is on 2016 level) While TFS seems to work OK, Sharepoint is playing up - I can't login to the server on port 80 where the collection is, although I can login to the admin pages on a different port. When going to the collection directly I get:
