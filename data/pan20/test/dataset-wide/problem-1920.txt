I will add one more answer to this question to emphasize several things that seem to be being overlooked. 

I would tell my old employer that they should have kept me closer in the loop. Beyond that, if this investment round is make or break for them, I would say that I had no idea I was so critical, explain I should have been told, and demand equity and access to the business plan in order to stay on. Another route I would consider is whether or not the two businesses could synergise. If so, I would suggest that a solution could be an overlap period where you work on something useful to both businesses while taking double pay. I have been in a similar situation a few times and my experience is that a) you should never walk on a project you committed to b) you should leave employers for new ones if the pay is higher and conditions better long term, where you are not on a contracted project 

Currently, we have built products that are not yet out in the public. However, they make up quite a huge and important chunk of my portfolio.. to demonstrate what I've done for the project. I am a UX specialist and I need a lot of visuals to showcase what I've done. And I am not even sure if I can even mention about these unreleased products. How do I handle this? 

As a background, I am currently working as a foreigner where in 90% of my colleagues speak the local language and while the other 10% speak another language. Cut the story short, I'm the only one in the office that is of my nationality. We recently shifted office and my seating arrangement changed. I am currently sitting in the middle of a group of all-locals and they'd often speak their language unless they're specifically speaking to me (where in they'd switch to English). For one, I am not complaining that they should speak in English. It's their country and they can speak their local language. However, I feel very distracted and feel unintentionally left out when they banter which I didn't feel when I was seated further. It makes me very unhappy in an otherwise friendly and nice environment. Is it reasonable for me to ask one of my colleagues, who was actually was previously in the same seating position I currently am to swap seats? I say same position because the arrangement of the group didn't change even if we shifted office. Only the two of us swapped. His seat is on the edge and I'd feel more comfortable to be a little bit further from the rest (which was where my old seat was). I don't know how to say it to him without offending anyone. Like, what if my current seat mate thinks I don't like him (which isn't true) because I wanted to change seat. And without coming off as fussy. But it really affects my concentration. 

I would just get really riled with the coworker and tell them loud and plain that you can't work with the blind open and to damn well shut it when I come back in the room. If this doesn't work, get hold of a big mirror, preferably a fresnel lens, and point it so when s/he opens the blind,their monitor melts. This would be an interim fix until I boot management up the backside with a 'fix this before I call health and safety inspectors' warning. 

In Central Europe in IT it is expected that you join on a lower salary and undergo a trial period. In IT this can easily be 12 month, especially for a junior. To then expect a rise is normal. There is no logical implication that this would imply an annual rise. Since the financial crisis CPI inflation rarely has any effect on salary. The contrary. Since the crisis, the biggest effect on salaried employee living costs is consumer debt interest rates which have dropped annually. CPI inflation is much lower than asset price inflation. 

Is it alright to take 1-2 days leave if you are still on probation? I would almost be 3 months in the company during this period but this trip I'm planning is 2 weeks earlier than the end of my probation period. And I cannot move the date. How do I negotiate with our HR about this? I'm willing to be unpaid during this 1-2 days leave. 

I'm working overseas and almost all of my colleagues speak another language (their native language). They talk to me in English regarding work-related stuff and everyone speaks English during meetings. So this is fine. However, during lunch time or other personal conversations in the office, everyone almost speaks their native language and I feel excluded. Like, whenever we all go out for lunch, I would sit with them quietly while they all talk about something I don't understand. Sometimes, they would change into English and that's only the time I can join in the conversation but after a while, they'll speak in their native language and I'll feel excluded again. (Personally, if I am talking to someone who speaks my native language and someone joins in who doesn't speak it, I would automatically switch to English. I would feel very uncomfortable with someone sitting there not knowing what we are talking about.) I'm not used to this set-up because in my previous work (in this same country), all my colleagues would speak English once they know that someone in the table cannot speak their native language. That way, I was able to make good friends in the office (who are friends outside the office too). Most of my waking hours in a week are spent in the office and it's very frustrating to have no friends in the office where I spend 8 hours a day, 5x a week due to the language barrier. And even more frustrating because they all speak fluent English, just that it's not their preferred mode of speaking. Which I understand because it's not their native language. My question is how do I deal with such an environment? Should I just consider the people in the office as just colleagues, start distancing myself (like maybe lunch on my own?), and give up on any hope of making personal friends there? On one hand, I won't have friends in the office and I'm just there purely for work but on the other hand, my life would be easier if I remove any expectations of making friends. If I distance myself, then I won't feel intentionally excluded (although they may not intend it, that's how I feel). It's just a bullet I have to bite by working in a foreign country. 

My approach to this kind of problem is to ensure there is sufficient methodology and tooling in place to make the issue technical and not personal. For example, make sure you have automated builds and smoke tests. If these get broken, have a rule that the breaker must provide food at the next team meeting. Sometimes people will just boldly challenge the status quo in a selfish quest for personal progress. In a way, this is normal. It is entrepreneurial at best. The individual is moving forward in a framework that permits it. So, change the framework. Those types of people will not be thwarted, they will make progress in different ways. So as a manager your aim is to harness that spirit and direct it in a way that is positive for the team and the aims. Part of that strategy of harnessing will is to make sure people still feel a sense of ownership. The most popular answer here thus far advocates a philosophy of renunciation of ownership. I think this may be counterproductive. Let people passionately own their area. But make sure they do not trespass others'. 

I want to record our meetings, especially discussions about projects, because I often miss some important details they tell me and my writing cannot catch-up. However, I don't feel like I need to tell them as they may feel it's an invasion of privacy. I have no malicious intent whatsoever, just really so that I can review the project details / comments and not miss out any. 

I went for an interview and the employer asked for my current salary to which I replied X amount. However, I included in the amount the yearly bonus that we receive which essentially bumps up my monthly salary by a little bit (whether this is ethical or not is another discussion). However, to continue with the process of hiring, they asked for my payslip which doesn't reflect the bonus that I've received. This is also the first time I've been asked of my payslip during the hiring process. How do I answer to them if they ask me why my payslip amount is a little less than what I've mentioned?
