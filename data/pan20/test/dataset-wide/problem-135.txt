Subsumation. Rather than a schism, a new religion may come along that absorbs the followers of the original religion. As a substantial number of followers convert to the new religion, the original religion is eventually reduced to nothing. 

One possible solution to data decay would be a mirrored array of data storage devices (possibly hard drives or flash memory). You would probably need an array of four or eight drives (possibly with some mirrored parity drives) to maintain data for centuries if not millennia. Flash memory would probably be best, since it's non-magnetic and the main limitation on its lifespan is read / write cycles. Even if there is significant data corruption on all the drives, you should be able to restore most if not all the data. At that point, you're dealing with physical breakdown of the device, not decay of the data itself. An optimal climate controlled environment would probably protect the data storage devices themselves for 400 years. If you're looking for longer-term storage and not concerned about cost or capacity, you can use gold leaf punchcards - which will last pretty much indefinitely. The computer itself probably wouldn't be in great shape after 400 years. Modern electronics simply aren't designed to last that long - a few decades at most. With careful consideration and design - as well as an ideal environment - would probably let you work around those problems. A sealed inert gas environment might do the trick there. 

There are a number of historical examples of attempts to exterminate religions, but probably the most relevant historical examples would be the willful extermination of the religions of Native Americans. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, their destruction of the Native civilizations - through extermination, disease, enslavement, and forced religious conversion essentially eliminated those religions entirely. 

With only a single day's knowledge, and a single chance to exploit this day's knowledge, the correct answer would almost certainly be lottery tickets. There are few - if any - ways to make a short term 'profit' on a par with gambling, and knowing the day's lottery numbers is the only way that would really be possible for an individual to accomplish in the repeat of a single day. Many iterations may allow more theoretically profitable opportunities (such as repeated wins at casino games), but Joe would only need to memorize a single sequence of numbers to win the lottery - something completely doable in a single day. Ideally, Joe would play and win the lottery multiple times in a day (Pick-4 in the afternoon, reinvest in bigger payouts later) but the fixed maximum payouts on a single lottery would probably limit the value of that strategy unless Joe could play multiple different lotteries all at once. Of course, if Joe's trying to accomplish this without attracting any attention (once the day ends and he's back on regular time), simply playing the single largest lottery once would be the way to go. 

Other considerations Recoverability: This is how they were designed to be stored, this should not be a problem if the facility remained intact. Deterioration: As for recoverability, hopefully a unit designed to be stored in water will not corrode when stored in water. Footprint: Well within standard warehouse sizes, as big or small as you like really. I advise making reference to earthquake proofing. Availability of used materials: Nothing special going on here. Concrete, water, steel. 

Everyone1 in the UK grew up with the plastic descant recorder and the horrible noises made when these tortured instruments were handed out to a primary school class. Why the descant recorder though? For two basic reasons 

While a sphere is more efficient for material used against internal space created, a cuboid generates more effectively useful internal space without the losses caused by curved walls. Since you've handwaved off most of the relevant physics, you're basically building a large shipping container, so stick with that thought. It allows easy landing, easy loading, easy docking, easy modular structures. Keep it simple. 

How does logic apply to government? Logic applies when you have a stated aim and you need the simplest path to achieve it. The straight line from A to B is logical. It's illogical to have emotional attachment to the things that are destroyed along that path. For example, it's economically logical to introduce euthanasia for people over the age of 85 or earlier if they become a burden on society rather than a benefit. Is that really a logical path you want to follow? One could say it's not emotionally logical, it's certainly not logical if one wants to remain in power. Is remaining in power one of your specifically required outcomes? If so that will lead down a path of repression of freedoms, if not then some outrageous character appealing to the basest emotions of the public could take power and undo all your hard work. Technocracies don't tend to last long, people are too emotional. What you're asking for is basically a technocracy, hopefully with a hint of meritocracy. Logically run by the best and brightest. Government however is about compromise, it's about negotiation, it's about allowing for arbitrary special interest groups, supporting uneconomic sections of society because they improve society, not the economy. Logic and science don't know this, only emotion does. 

The base of the Burj Khalifa covers an area of roughly 3.5 acres. There are roughly 7 billion acres of usable land on earth by the given requirements, which means you could cover the earth with approximately 2 billion Burj Khalifas. The Burj Khalifa has 300,000 square meters of space, so if each person has 10,000 square meters of space you could fit 30 people in the space of a single Burj Khalifa. That establishes a maximum population of roughly 60 billion people in an earth whose surface is entirely covered in Burj Khalifas. I will note that 10,000 square meters of space is a lot of space, and the infrastructure of the Burj Khalifa that doesn't figure into the 300,000 square meter calculation could easily (with the benefits of economies of scale) house the infrastructure to support this population. Especially when you consider how advanced a civilization that could build this megastructure would be. I was going with arable land...the total land area of earth is roughly 40 billion acres, so (40 / 7) * 60 billion = ~340 billion people. A trillion if you assume the structure is uniform with no gaps or taper. 

Any gun that propels a projectile with air or a spring should meet the criteria above. Some of these that are available today fire a pellet or slug with a higher kinetic energy than a .22 bullet. A rail or gauss style gun could meet the criteria to fire some form of projectile. A gyrojet-style gun that fires self-propelled mini-rockets could meet this criteria and use either a compressed propellant or some form of chemical reaction to propel the rockets. Some form of air vortex cannon could possibly meet the criteria, although it would probably be bulkier than a modern firearm and wouldn't fire a consumable projectile. There are tazer-style weapons that fire a self-contained slug instead of keeping the battery in the tazer itself. There are some knives that can fire a spring-loaded blade (Spetsnaz knives) but they are generally single-use. A modern compound bow certainly isn't something primitive or basic - they can be fairly compact, accurate, and powerful. Same thing goes for modern crossbows. A speargun (air propelled or spring / elastic fired) isn't primitive either - although it fires a spear / dart it's more than a pointy stick. Um, I guess a slingshot (wrist rocket) would probably qualify as well. Maybe a blowgun that fires some sort of round containing poison / tranquilizers? 

So the answer is no for a much simpler set of reasons than you're anticipating. Without fire we're just a set of slightly brighter than average apes. We've evolved as a result of our technologies to the point where we could no longer live without fire. It's impossible to maintain the brain mass and body mass that we have without cooking, without fire. 

Suppressed ego allowing all members of the group to act primarily towards the common good. Expanded social consciousness (monkeysphere), they would have to recognise every member of the species as part of their social group. In times of shortage the group pulls together to survive. In times of plenty, when greed would become an issue, the reduced ego means that they rejoice in the increased prosperity of the group rather than the individual. Since all members of the species are automatically members of the group, they can't fight an internal war. God help you if you pick a fight with them though, since a fight with one may well turn out to be a fight with all of them. 

Of course outside Ankh-Morpork it's never that simple, but some crimes require different environments to others. Drugs always brings violence, how do you keep drug crime under control? Legalise and regulate. Let the pharmacies sell uppers and downers over the counter like they did once before. The drugs become safer because they're a known quantity, you no longer have organised crime selling drugs. Sure you'll get rowdy stag parties showing up to get high but that's always a risk of tourism. People will always find a way to get off their faces, legally or illegally. Gambling and prostitution are the key industries you want. Both bring a certain level of tourist income and require a relatively safe and stable environment. Protection rackets are a complex one, a certain level will have to be tolerated as protection from petty crime (you might not need an insurance industry in the same way) but you don't want the small businesses under too much pressure, the little people need to be able to make a living. Your ideal situation is Big Tony running underground casinos and some questionable hotels providing a "safe" environment for the girls and having it in his best interests that the tourists don't get hassled on their way to and from his establishments. Define the bounds within which he's allowed to operate and what behaviours will and won't be tolerated, if he strays outside them then clips his fingernails a little by arresting some minions, but give him freedom to operate otherwise. Depending on your arrangements you can call him in for a little chat if there's too much petty crime or the rules are breached. After all, you know where he lives and where his children go to school. 

The big problem with using flatulence for power instead of petroleum is that food has a lot less energy than petroleum products. A gallon of gasoline contains roughly 30,000 calories worth of energy, which is roughly comparable to the number of calories a person could consume daily under the most extreme circumstances. Even then, consumption of this many calories would be unsustainable for human physiology. A gallon of gasoline per day isn't particularly useful, especially if it can't be produced and stockpiled. After all, storing it means you're wasting energy compressing or otherwise bottling the methane, and you have extra weight to cart around. You've also got to spend a lot of energy growing the food and getting it to people. Modern food production and distribution is energy intensive, and you're talking about a ~10 fold increase in the amount of food that needs to be distributed to the consumer. On top of that, without petroleum you can't (efficiently) produce modern fertilizers that give us our current crop yields. You would probably be better off just giving everyone bicycles and keeping them on their current diets. Or even burning the food itself for energy instead of reprocessing it into methane. If you insist on going the methane route instead of creating bio-diesel or alcohol (which are arguably easier to handle and use), you're better off doing it on an industrial scale located where the crops are grown instead of in the human body then distributing it from there. 

The first manned spacecraft that humans launched was Vostok 1 in 1961, which orbited the earth for 108 minutes (roughly two hours). Using this as the baseline of a 'spaceship', a human could likely have survived in space as early as the 4th century BC. Air A person inhales and exhales roughly 15 cubic feet of air per hour. To survive two hours, a person would need 30 cubic feet of air. With a typical adult male human body occupying a volume of ~3 cubic feet, a sphere of four foot diameter would easily hold a person and enough air to survive two hours in space. Diving bells were used as early as the 4th century BC, which means that technology of the time could produce a shell that was air tight. Since the spacecraft wouldn't need to resist the water pressure a diving bell would need to resist, it's possible that some type of airtight(ish) bladder / balloon could be large enough to hold both a person and two hours of air at a much earlier time. Even if the bell / bladder wasn't completely airtight, coating the bell / bladder with pitch would have provided enough of a seal to prevent too much air loss. After two hours CO2 buildup in a craft of this volume would start to pose a danger, but the occupant could certainly survive such a flight. An arbitrarily larger bell / bladder could extend the time of this flight almost indefinitely. Heat Since vacuum is an excellent insulator, an additional heat source wouldn't be necessary. Furs or other heavy clothing would be sufficient to keep the occupant of the craft warm. As the craft becomes larger and the outside surface area increases, the body heat of the occupant could not extend the flight indefinitely. Without an additional heat source, the body heat of the occupant could not extend the flight indefinitely. Still, with careful heat management, good insulation, and perhaps preheated objects to supplement the occupant's body heat, the occupant could perhaps survive a full day before the craft radiated too much heat and the occupant froze to death. Radiation Who cares? Worrying about an increased risk of cancer in old age is a thoroughly modern concept. Reentry This is a tough one with traditional power sources, but we don't have the same limitation here. A limitless power source would allow the craft to re-enter the atmosphere at an arbitrary speed, so re-entry heating issues don't need to be considered. Additionally, if care were used the heat problem above could be mitigated (using atmospheric friction to warm the craft) making the volume of the craft (and air contained within) the primary limiting factor of flight time. Other needs For a two hour round trip, a person would be able to survive with nothing more than air and warmth. Additional comforts like light, food / water, or hygiene would be secondary and could be addressed in one way or another. The occupant wouldn't have to be happy or comfortable, but people can survive a significant amount of discomfort. Other thoughts This certainly wouldn't be the safest or most comfortable way to travel into space, but historically the value of life hasn't been particularly high. An ancient general / civilization would probably think little of sending dozens or hundreds of men to their deaths in a such a manner, and in all likelihood many would survive their trips into space. Time to and from orbit might be a concern as well, as such craft wouldn't be able to travel at high rates of speed in the lower atmosphere, but it probably wouldn't change this considerably. The actual mechanics of this craft would, of course, be dictated by the nature of the magical propulsion system.
