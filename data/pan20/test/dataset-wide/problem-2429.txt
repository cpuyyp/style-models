So you should look inside and see where your detachment comes from. If it comes from weakness then, while on the surface it looks like detachment, it really is a form of attachment. If that is the case then you should definitely engage with that "someone" - not as much for the sake of what you see as "truth" from your side - as for the practice of overcoming your (hidden) attachment. 

Yes, the raw perception and/or raw feeling may exist without us making the extra step of interpreting it as a part of a context that belongs to an object that participates in an event. E.g. we may learn to see woman's curves as just curves, without falling victim to our associative mechanisms. 

@Robin111, this is a great question and a turning point from "Hinayana"-type-mentality to "Mahayana"-type-mentality (note: I'm not speaking about the schools Theravada and Mahayana, as both of these two types of mentality can be found within both Theravada and Mahayana schools). The practice of transcending one's ego involves continuously reflecting upon one's actions and choices to see if they are biased with ego perspective. As this practice is refined, you may find yourself finding egoistic motives in seemingly egoless choices and vice versa. This is normal and good. Keep going until the end ;) 

I'm not sure Nirvana is "pleasant" or "full of blessings". That sounds like Sat-Chit-Ananda. In Vedic tradition that said to be the nature of Brahman or Ishvara. Some Mahayana traditions actually do what you say and call it our true nature or true self. It doesn't matter what you call things as long as you know what is what. Labels are useful for their explanatory power, but once you have direct vision, you see that labels are only fingers pointing the direction. Dharma is a map or rather a guidebook. The jungle is not the book. 

In my understanding of their meaning, the "five heaps of wood" also known as The Five Aggregates, is a schema explaining phenomenological makeup of our subjective existence. In other words, everything that we can ever be aware of, is like a soup made from the following types of ingredients: 

A lam rim (~syllabus) text, e.g. Treasury of Precious Qualities by Jigme Lingpa with commentary by Kangyur Rinpoche. The Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva. A prajnaparamita sutra e.g. Edward Conze's The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom: With the Divisions of the Abhisamayalankara. 

As far as dietary guidelines for Enlightenment, I really like the "Three Gunas" model. I feel many people these days lack fundamental intuition for what constitutes good or bad energy when it comes to eating. The Three Gunas model provides a set of guidelines that people can follow until they develop an intuitive feel for healthy eating. In their simplest form, the three gunas can be defined as: 

I think Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika is the work you are looking for. Just like Brahma-sutras does not mention specific Buddhist sutras it debates with, Mulamadhyamakakarika does not mention Brahma-sutras, but it does methodically address the same points. As ancient texts go, Mulamadhyamakakarika is way too obscure to be brought in here and contrasted point by point, luckily the details of the polemics between the two commentary traditions are surveyed in the book you mentioned, a modern (1980s) work "An Evaluation of the Vedantic Critique of Buddhism". The author concludes (emphasis mine): 

I'm not a scholar of Chinese Buddhism, all I known is that the gradual enlightenment tradition was referred to as "The Northern School of Chan" and the sudden enlightenment got known as "The Southern School of Chan". Googling for these two terms turns up some useful references. Let's see what we can learn from these... Wikipedia articles on Chan Buddhism - Southern School, East Mountain Dharma Gate, Subitism - Chan, and Shenhui provide some historical information about the two approaches. From all the evidence it looks like the distinction was made up and promulgated by Shenhui, the student of Huineng whose adversary Shenxiu was later portrayed as that infamous monk in the Platform Sutra who lost the famous verse contest for their common teacher Hongren of East Mountain Dharma Gate (the original Chan school tracing back to Bodhidharma himself). Shenhui sharply criticized Shenxiu's Northern School's emphasis on ceremony and sutra study - and contrasted it with seated meditation of Huineng and the original East Mountain Dharma Gate: 

The Huike story, although seemingly about the same topic, is actually a reference to another principle of Buddhism, the principle of "immediacy". The problem with most students is that their minds focus on Buddhist theory while ignoring their immediate state of mind, with its deep-lying conflict. Even the quest for Nirvana is a state of conflict, as we identify "this" as "wrong" and Nirvana as right. No amount of theory helps until the student admits this conflict in their own mind. So turning the student's mind to the present moment, to help it see its own conflict is THE core principle of Zen. This is why Zen is called "the school of direct pointing, beyond theory" (or something like that) That's why Bodhidharma says, "There, I have pacified your mind." - this last phrase is the "pointing directly at mind". At that moment Huike must have turned his attention to his own mind, and saw how grasping (the frustrating and hopeless act of trying to pinpoint the mind) was the very act that created his suffering, and how letting go of that grasping was letting go of that specific instance of suffering -- which was the stream-entry moment for him. The same principle is at work behind koans, when the act of letting go of the impossible problem leads to realization of the Third Noble Truth. 

From my experience, it is correct to encourage and "will the rapture into being". The most important point perhaps is that the bliss/rapture here are not just any contrived bliss/rapture, they are bliss/rapture born of the (cultivated, confirmed with insight) feeling that everything is right, that you are right. That's the key here. Suchness! Total complete non-conceptual Emptiness is like this. You don't have ground but (and therefore) you are very steady. Some call it unmovable diamond ground, or Diamond Samadhi. That's the nature of bliss we are talking about! Deep Groundlessness and Complete Thusness-Confidence stemming from it. The bliss of meditation is a proximate cause thereof, to induce by virtue of being a simile of. (That said, it must be remembered that the rapture/bliss in-and-of-itself is not part of the liberating realization, groundlessness is) PS. This is shamatha, yes, all jhanas are. But if you skip it and get to the realization through other (i.e. intellectual) means you will still have to come back and polish your suchness anyway, so why not do it upfront. As I said before, jhanas is not something you find yourself in, it is what you work on. Any meditation that involves deliberate cultivation of certain mindset is not vipashyana. The four jhanas are a kind of shamatha specifically aimed at generation of rapture-bliss-suchness-groundlessness. Once the fourth jhana has been attained, our friend Gotama naturally found himself in vipashyana. Anapanasati is a very generic description of the same basic method, perhaps less centered on Gotama's personal experience than is the four jhanas story, a little more generalized for an average practitioner. As I understand, the five precepts were the preliminary practice for taming the mind, followed by kasinas and cultivation of disgust (later replaced by Anapana!), followed by the four jhanas (generation of progressively subtler suhkha-becoming-suchness), followed by vipashyana. So it is like first you achieve basic isolation from unskillful qualities, then learn to focus inside and see your own mental and emotional obscurations, then learn to overcome these and generate certain mindset and mood, then start crossing over to the four noble truths while at the same time exploring relationship between suffering and craving on one hand, and bliss and suchness on the other, and then falling out from blissful kinds of suchness into true groundlessness. So you can see that the role of rapture/bliss generation here is to both provide pleasant dwelling in the here and now, but more importantly to serve as the stepping stone to suchness and then groundlessness of nirvana. 

How deep are the bonds between the one giving Jukai and the one receiving it? It is not like that, it is between you and Dharma: 

Sounds like a koan. Are you a hidden Zen master? ;) "Is Buddha a man or woman?" -- "Buddha is awesome!" :) Seriously, Buddha is your own true nature, how can it be limited to gender? 

This is an interesting point. My (Asian) teacher explained to me that integrity as a concept has a different meaning in Eastern culture. We in the west often assume that integrity = honesty. But really if you think about it, integrity is the opposite of corruption. Integrity is being true to the right values. In the Eastern society permeated by Mahayana Buddhism social harmony is such primary value. So integrity in this sense means, being committed to maximizing the social harmony and well-being. Even at the expense of technical scientific honesty. In the examples from the sutta, Buddha praises a man who deemphasizes other's faults, emphasizes other's virtues, emphasizes own faults, and deemphasizes own virtues. This is part of integrity in the above sense. In Mahayana, upaya or expedient means is something that can be technically not true but practically of value, and so is preferred to naked truth that is often not palatable or even harmful. My personal opinion is that The Wheel has rolled too far down this path, and I would like to correct that by being a little more upfront about things, but I still have to recognize that things are not always as black and white as our passion for brutal honesty would like us to believe sometimes. Your example with job references is obviously not a scenario the historical Buddha had in mind. I'm not in a position to give universal guidance on a topic like this, but when I have to serve as someone's reference, I try to give a balanced response. Meaning, instead of unloading my subjective opinion of the person ("the truth") as if it was final, I try to be cautious with my conclusions, especially the negative ones, and give the person benefit of doubt. Which is sort of what the Buddha said. 

(Vajrayana) Buddhism is an non-theistic teaching. All deities, yidams etc. are understood to be expressions of one's own nature, one's own mind. At the same time, it is clearly understood that "one's own" mind is not really "one's own" -- because there is no such independent entity as "I", the mind does not have boundaries between outer and inner. From this perspective the energies, deities and other inhabitants of the noosphere can indeed be considered "independent" agents (subject to caveat of universal Emptiness). As part of working on a tantra, practitioner interacts and communicates with the deities, participates in rituals etc. that may look like deity worship but are in fact psychoenergetic exercises. When involved in tantra though, we must clearly see that all these experiences are 100% real, otherwise they will not produce the intended effect on the mind. Because reality is an interpretation we make, being able to sincerely switch between alternative interpretations (materialistic, phenomenological, energy-centric, animalistic) is an important skill to be acquired towards complete mastery of the mind-made reality. 

1a. will grasping stop? Grasping will not stop, grasping occurs. 2a. will grasping re-arise? Grasping will not re-arise, grasping will not stop, grasping occurs. There is no enlightened person, there is no ignorant person, there is just grasping, aka neurosis. This neurosis is what's passed from life to life. Once you learn to be free from neurosis, you learn to be free from termination of life, from "person" etc. 

At first approximation, when Third Noble Truth promises cessation of , it hints at attainment of everlasting . Indeed, once you drop your attachments (as per Second Noble Truth), including positive ones (desires, expectations) as well as negative ones (aversions, clinging to something inevitably transient etc.) then the feeling of wrongness is no longer generated. In effect, all experience becomes agreeable, resulting in a permanent experience of . If we look deeper though, we can notice Buddha's emphasis on Three Marks of Existence: Impermanence, Corelessness and Dukkha as universal unconditional characteristics of existence-at-large. Because things are transient and lack a stable absolute point of reference, Dukkha is inevitably generated as mind in its modeling activity always lags behind reality. So even someone who fully understood the mechanism of , is never 100% free from occasional experiences of "wrongness", as fluctuations of mind over long time invariably generate mismatches between "is" and "should". So in all truth Nibbana is not and can't be a sterile ease, but rather a philosophical appreciation of things as they are () in all their complexity. Instead of being everlasting Nibbana goes beyond by transcending the dichotomy altogether. This understanding is reflected in the succession of stages in which the practitioner 

The same old trick, wise application of attention. Moving one's perception into position where the problem of loneliness does not exist. The possibilities are infinite, from getting oneself involved with abstract sciences, to computer programming, creative performance and art, music -- to convincing oneself that loneliness is not only acceptable, but in fact natural for persons of high realization and beneficial for their well-being -- to direct Jhana experience of reviewing one's mental continuum and praising it for the absence of typical ups and downs that would have inevitably accompanied socializing. 

This is a very interesting question. In psychological interpretation of Buddhism, our perception of reality is mediated by our mind's modeling and representational activity. In this perspective the state of our mind - our biases, preconceptions, emotional condition - form the interpretative/evaluative framework through which we perceive reality. This perception of reality then determines our reactions and choices, which lead to immediate and latent effects (karma). This works as self-fulfilling prophecy or a self-reinforcing vicious circle: negative mindstates => negative interpretation => negative action => negative effects => negative mindstates. In ontological interpretation(s) of Buddhism the structure of reality is understood to be different from what we normally assume, and its relationship with mind is not just that of modeling and observation. In one such interpretation, reality consists of multiple planes ("realms") between which we can shift depending on our state of mind, each of these realms looking like a complete world with its own consistent logic. In other interpretations, reality is either multidimensional or quantum, with our mind either able to change the focus along the extra dimension(s) or collapse the quantum function. In yet another interpretation there are no fixed planes as such, and whatever we perceive is assembled by our minds from some sort of multidimensional strings of energy. As far as I know, there is no one who seems to be able to explain exactly how this stuff works... Two of my Buddhist teachers insisted that reality is literally a reflection of our mindstate. In other words, they claimed that Buddhism is not a psychological metaphor. One of them alluded to the "multidimensional worlds" interpretation and the other mentioned "multidimensional strings" - but none gave exhaustive explanation. The other Buddhist teachers I interacted with or studied under, remained ambiguous on the matter. Most of the time, the attitude I get is: "it does not matter what it is as long as you know how to navigate it." The Buddha himself remained famously ambiguous on the question with his Safe Bet theory:
