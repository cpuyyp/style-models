It's not that these questions are not interesting, they certainly are, but they will not lead one to Nibbana. They will only distract and agitate the mind, leaving it unfit for practice. If you really want to know the answer to these questions, not only intellectually but experientially, then you have to become a fully enlightened Buddha (SammƒÅsambuddha). 

A person who has these tendencies is suffering greatly. He is causing great harm to himself and other beings by acting on the unwholesome roots of greed, anger and delusion. It does not really matter if you trust him or not. There is still the possibility that he could use or betray you. One cannot control reality. One is just given a hand of cards. It's up to oneself to find out how to play that hand in the most beneficial and wholesome way. Let's look at both scenarios. 

I do not know how a monk would answer such questions since i'm not a monk myself. Being asked how the food is one could answer in different ways. If one answers: "The food is good. I like it" one is in a way confirming one's own attachment to the food. That could become an issue since one is trying to overcome attachments and purify oneself of defilements. One could instead answer: "Thank you for the food. I appreciate the effort put into making it. Food is important to the upkeep of the human body. Upkeeping the human body is important since it allows one to practice longer and help other beings more". Then one could as you suggest give a teaching on the impermanence of conditioned phenomena or one could give a teaching on dependent origination regarding the danger of attaching to sense pleasures and how that leads to suffering and further becoming. 

I was wondering about the clearing away of the shrine. It could be that there exists an attachment to the shrine. By clearing it away when periods of stagnation occurs it is like affirming that a period of stagnation is "bad" or "not good" or "a problem". These are merely concepts designated to a certain situation. In ultimate reality what you experience is only a combination of hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, feeling, thinking. Making the situation into either positive or negative is one's own work. We create our own suffering by wishing for reality to be something different than it already is. The clearing away of the shrine could indicate that there is a self involved in this. It is like saying "i am angry" or "i am sad". There is an affirmation or validation going on here. In reality there is mental and physical phenomena arising and ceasing on their own accord. Do not identify or take ownership of these impersonal and uncontrollable phenomena. By reacting to them you provide them further fuel to burn. See them for what they are. You can turn these phenomena into objects of observation and create a foundation for cultivation of insights. Lastly, here is a great dhamma talk by Ven. Yuttadhammo. Robin was so sweet to post it in one of my questions. In here it is talked about how one can adjust ones own practice by using 4 different tools. This talk is very beneficial for any meditator. Hope this helps. If you need me to elaborate on anything i've just said, please let me know. 

Mindfulness will "protect" your practice. Mindfulness is a wholesome mental factor (cetasika) and when it is present, one is not reacting to phenomena, i.e. by running away from unpleasant phenomena and running after pleasant phenomena. Instead one is standing still. One is in the present moment, clearly recognizing that it is our own reactions to phenomena that create suffering. An unwholesome thought or anger is still just a thought and a feeling. Its our own aversion towards these objects, that create our suffering. So by keeping mindfulness at all times, one is protecting ones practice. I would recommend the video "How Mindfulness Creates Understanding (The Buddhist TV)" by Ven. Yuttadhammo. 

It's true that a partner in love can make one happy, no doubt. That love can be liberating, deep and precious. The downside, is that, this happiness is not permanent or lasting. It will disappear again and one will experience suffering as a result. What Buddhism teaches, is that if one would like to achieve a permanent happiness then one should not look for it in conditioned existence (samsara), because it cannot be found in a world that is impermanent. To achieve lasting and permanent happiness one must realize Nibbana, the unconditioned, unborn and uncaused state. Nibbana is not subject to incessant arising and falling away, thus it is stable, secure and permanent. 

Theravada Buddhist answer, based in the Burmese Method. It is still just fear, no matter what context it is experienced in. It's an impersonal phenomena that arise and cease on its own accord, without it being amenable to ones will. It should be observed and noted, in order to learn about the phenomena, i.e. to see its characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and uncontrollability. When one truly sees that feelings and emotions cannot be controlled, one begins to let go of them. They are just processes. There is no experiencing entity behind the phenomena. One comes to see that its not really the fear that is the "problem". Its ones own aversion to that fear. 

No, that is not possible. Volition/intention no longer has any potency. Actions no longer bear fruits. Actions become merely "functional" (kiriya) in nature. 

The Buddha's Teaching is a not a theoretical teaching but a practical teaching. The Buddha invites one to come and see1 for oneself. In SN 1:20 - Samiddhi Sutta, its taught that; "This Dhamma is here-present, out of time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realized by the wise each for himself". Human beings, mankind and evolution are all concepts that do not have any real reference point, ie. a reference to Ultimate reality. The question becomes meaningless when observed from a practical/meditational point of view. The question belongs to the Four Imponderables, namely the origin-element. The Buddha teaches only about suffering and how to become free from it. 

It will be too lengthy to treat all four aspects here so i would recommend the reading of the chapter about kamma. It can be found in the book "Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma" by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, p. 200-220. I no not know how to answer the "resetting-aspect" of the question so i will instead address the 3. aspect of kamma, i.e. the Time of Ripening of kamma and in here the "Immediately effective kamma". First a definition of this type of kamma:
