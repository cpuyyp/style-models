Your people have a fear of the cannibals over the next hill. You kill their tribesmen but once every few years one turns up in your village, anyone who dies could be their next meal. 

Health We are not completely certain about all the health effects zero-gravity has on the human body yet, but so far it is not looking good for the growth of healthy humans. This is a major topic for nasa recently who put a man in space for a year who also had a twin on earth in the hopes of finding the most precise changes to his body. The results are not in yet, but the whole article is here. 

Having a lime stone cave system with a lot of water draining through it to create Stalactite columns should work perfectly for your labyrinth. 

Maybe you don't see this, but this sounds like a more militarized version of spooks from the "last apprentice" novels. Make their system a trade skill, not a common skill, this will reduce the number but improve the quality. You can ensure quality by providing quality check at the national/regional level. Keeping the numbers low enough will increase their prices and can avoid working for long periods without devolving to bandits. Making sure this position was attainable by most of the population prevents a complete caste system and provides upward mobility to the civilians that do take the initiative to deal with their own problems. Keeping the practitioners local also makes them less likely to extort their clients through force. 

Carbon Dioxide lakes happen at much deeper locations in the ocean than Brine pools. The depths typically needed are 10,000 ft below sea level as the temperature is low enough that liquid carbon dioxide is denser than salt water and can be collected in pools. There are other ways to make them, like volcanic underwater geysers that release CO2 into underwater holes. Fish take in oxygen rich water in order to breath, and I would imagine spells that allow breathing under water do the same thing, using CO2 lakes the raiders would suffocate underwater, just like they not able to breath with a spell. You would need to hand-wave some of this in order for them to form close to an island but both would work well for defending against underwater attacks. As added bonuses, neither should interrupt ship travel, so normal traders should never even notice it there. Also, due to lack of oxygen Iron weapons dropped by the raiders into either should stay in relatively good condition for collection later. 

They already have low voices. The inverse of point #1 above. Related: the lower the pitch of the growl, the stronger the creature seems, since it implies that the creature is bigger. The growl imitates a large local predator, such as a big cat. Related to point #2 above. 

Pick some events of importance to early agrarian societies. Basic examples: the new life of spring (plants in bloom, baby animals, etc.), the autumn harvest, the winter solstice. Flesh out some pagan traditions that would have come about in response to these events. Physical offerings, bonfires or mass candle-lighting, music and dance are some options to start, but don't be afraid to make them more specific. Pick certain symbols and details that cultures might latch onto over the years. Establish at least a few major religions of your world, based geographically. Write out some myths and stories for them. Think about which ones would be most central to that religion. According to your world's history and geography, assign these religious meanings to your celebrations. Consider which cultures were dominant in certain regions at certain points in history; this will affect how some religions will adapt to the existing religions of others, for example to avoid persecution. Give the holidays a few hundred years for the pagan traditions and religious traditions to merge and evolve. Not all aspects of Christmas are Christian, for example, but not everyone knows this. 

I vaguely remember reading about a study done years ago. I'm sure I'm remembering the details wrong, but it went something like this: test subjects were shown pictures of people of different races, and their reactions (spikes in brain activity) were measured, but one group was shown pictures of people in normal clothes and the other was shown pictures of people in color-coded sports team uniforms. Test subjects in the latter group reacted much more strongly to their fictional team divisions than to racial divisions. This leads me to believe that in your scenario, the Lorans and Lokk would feel much more visceral distrust of each other as species than they would against their own subgroups. Not only is there a larger, more obvious visual difference, akin to the color-coding of the study, but there's also the whole "unite against a common enemy" theme. That said, blankip raises a good point about how pervasive and how long ago racial tensions were for each species. I still think the species tension would be stronger than the racial tension in almost all cases, but the degree of difference may vary widely. You could still have very strong racial tension if a species is still in the grip of extreme racial prejudice; their union against the opposing species may be a very reluctant alliance. 

These lime stone caves become enormous, currently the deepest cave in the world is know as the Dark Star, measuring 17km at a depth of 900m. The whole thing is lime stone and not even completely explored. It is known as the underground Everest. 

Child Care In our current world we have a rising rate of single mothers. They require things like daycare, school, and after school organizations to keep their child in relatively safe locations and under super vision while the mother is at work. With most people entering the work force by the end of 6th grade your society would have a higher birth rate than right now. With more children you need a larger child care workforce and what better way then a government subsidized baby sitter who also tries to get your child an education and better job? 

It is socially rude to hold secrets from other people. Your mind linking society grows up learning the thoughts and feelings of others so in a public space they find it rude to have secret conversations with others. This would be similar to texting while out for dinner with friends. Telepathy makes others suspicious of your actions. In a police state no one wants you talking without being heard and even in a free democracy the government wants to keep tabs on it's civilians. As a protection to their personal freedom people speak out load so bugs and video cameras capture the events. The lack of speaking makes the person socially strange. Allowing unfettered emotional contact with any random person is the trade mark symbols of a sociopath who never questions his own thoughts. 

We can use a see through material at the poles as a green house. Have a see through material like quartz cover the top of the water ice and over time the heat from the sun will gather under it, melting the ice down to the surface. This will make the environment warm. The surface should be an easily drain able material like sand. This way as the ice melts to reveal the ground the water drains down into the earth. This will provide the environment to be dry. The planet will need a 0 degree axis to sustain this and simulate a night/day at the poles. The rest of the planet, and even above the pole it can be a ball of ice making the planet much like you wish. As per one of your comments, this sort of environment will doubtfully create human like species. 

First of all, I don't think there's any shame in taking our existing holidays as inspiration. Many holidays from different cultures on Earth have similar roots, typically in the meanings of the seasons and other natural phenomena. As religions developed over time, these holidays were imbued with new meanings. For example, a celebration of the winter equinox seems to be very common in Earth cultures. Early cultures may have wished to appease their gods or other forces of nature in the hopes that winter would end soon, but over time, the celebration itself became the highlight of the event. (Come on, the longest night of the year is exciting!) As ages passed, holidays such as Saturnalia, Hanukkah, and Christmas came about by pairing a certain religious event with the existing winter celebration. In fact, Christmas' date was assigned to align with Saturnalia and related celebrations, specifically the birth of Mithras. With that said, here are the steps I'd recommend to crafting fictional holidays: 

They already have high voices. Their vocal cords don't make low sounds very well, so a hiss would come more naturally than a growl. The hiss is an imitation of another animal that hisses when angry and dangerous. For example, perhaps your species hisses when threatened because a certain species of poisonous lizard or snake that lives in the area does the same thing, so the hissing sound is immediately associated with danger. 

Depends on two things: one, how intelligent your dragons are, and two, how non-threatening they look to your goats. Are your dragons the human analogue of your planet, or are they a threat to some other species that is a closer human analogue? Can the dragons speak to each other or to the humans with the complexity of human language? If they can, they're probably clever enough to figure out how to keep a herd of their favorite food captive, or at least learn how to do it from others. If they are not, I wouldn't count on them building fences anytime soon, but I could see them being smart enough to keep tabs on one or two wild herds in their territory and take steps to keep them within the territory, such as scaring them away from boundaries or creating obstacles like trenches or felled trees. This latter case would be much more like standard hunting (just with "their own" pet prey) than like proper domestication, but I'd say it's valid. Complicating the matter is the fact that your goats will likely be terrified of your dragon, if the dragon is as large as you say and looks and acts typically dragon-ish. They will know the dragon is a predator out to eat them, and unless your dragon has some way to make itself seem like a friend, it will have a hard time doing any proper domestication of them. To avert this, it may be worth considering possibilities for a symbiotic relationship. Perhaps the goats trust the dragon because the dragon gives the goats something: a home, protection, warmth, a nutrient or treat of some sort, safe breeding grounds? The bottom line is that for the goats to trust the dragon, they need to get something out of it that is worth members of their herd dying when the dragon gets hungry. Maybe the dragon helps them harvest a certain type of fruit that is a much more efficient energy source than grazing but grows too high up in trees for them to reach, for example. There's room for a lot of cool speculative symbiotic evolution if you take this route. 

Flex your brain muscles Humans have brains that evolved to do some thing well, like pattern recognition , and other things not so well, like risk assessment. Make your magic system use a piece of the brain that it just isn't good at, making your user devote greater amounts of resources to continue the practice. This is your system so you can hand wave an area your humans are poor at understanding and claim your magic requires that they do it. This also gives you the opportunity to explain why another race or species would be good at your magic. 

In a normal lifetime these skills take awhile to develop. In a simulation with accelerated speed (2x speed? 10x speed?) people who want to learn these skills put in a fraction of the amount of time. This would be especially important for slow developing adults (some forms of autism need more time to learn soft skills) or business skills like managing. Services A number of services are time intensive, being able to manipulate time would be a very nice ability to have for things like Therapy. Therapy costs as much as it does right now due to high demand and limited time in the day. If we make a 10x simulation a therapist can spend 6 real minutes with someone for 60 minutes of therapy. Other services would be things like reading. Ever want to read that whole book in a single night so you don't have to for a class/course? a 10x simulation would take care of that in no time. 

There is already a company in California doing this (soliculture), they are called "smart greenhouses" and use glass tinted magenta. They claim plants grow just as well in their green houses and have the potential to produce solar power as well. Take a look at this article detailing more about the idea. $URL$ you can also go to their corporate page. $URL$ 

Many weapons made prior to the industrial revolution can be made out of organics. I will start at the bronze age and move forward as that is where metal really began to take hold in military use. 

you may wish to look into the "Barbary Coast" which was a collection of pirate city-states that operated from the 1500's until the 1800's. They raided the Mediterranean during this time. These city states were so powerful that deals had to be made with groups like France, and Britain just to avoid Piracy in the Atlantic. When the US stopped being a British colony, the Barbary Coast began harassing American vessels. It got to the point where Two vessels were captured and held for ransom. This was the primary reason for the first 6 American frigates being built by Thomas Jefferson during his time as a minister to France during George Washington's presidency. It ended with American Marine's capturing one of the Barbary Cities. I suggest looking into how these cities operate as they were primarily piracy states funded through bribes, piracy, and the slave trade while being ruled by the Ottoman Empire. EDIT: It was pointed out that I did not make a full explanation for their Industry. I will do that now. The Barbary Pirates were investments for many goverments and merchants in this location of the world and most acted as privateers without letters of Marque. This was made possible under Ottoman rule for the primary purpose of slavery. For those who may not know, in the Quran it states a Muslim cannot own another Muslim. This makes Christian Slaves very valuable. It is estimated that somewhere between 1 to 1.25 million Christian Europeans were sold into slavery in the Barbary Coast during this time. The slaving locations for these pirates went as far north as Iceland. Many European nations did as much as they could to prevent being raided. This included ransoms and tribute, where it was said 20% of US government annual revenues were spent to pay Barbary Pirates prior to the wars (we have no concrete numbers from other countries). Notice that I have not made mention of any other industries. That is because these cities had very little control over their own territories. in Algeria, one of the capitals of Barbary Piracy, over 69% of the land disobeyed Ottoman rule. They refused to pay taxes, ignored rule of law, and were not held by central power. These people added little to no economic activity for the Ottomans to consider. The governments were themselves encouraging this slave trade. The Barbary Coast was ruled by the janissaries. They were an independent military arm for the Ottoman Empire. They slowly came to finance the majority of the Barbary Pirates.
