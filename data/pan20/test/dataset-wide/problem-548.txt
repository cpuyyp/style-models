First off many forks have a remote lock out as an add on. Fox and rock shox especially. If it has a lock out, a remote lock out is likely available. Secondly, a nice fork that is set up properly for your weight shouldn't need to be locked out all that often. I have had a variety of great fox and rock shox forks that i only lock on long, steep, grueling climbs where I am standing and pumping. This was more needed on a single speed. If you plan to sit and spin up a hill you dont need the lock out at all. Out of the last 5 forks i have had, all had a lockout, but only one with the remote. While the remote is convenient, I have never found it difficult to reach down and lock out on the fork while riding. 

I say visit yakima and thule websites, and use their tools to see what and how their racks work. Im sure you have a short lost of cars you are interested in. The great thing about yakima and thule is that its fairly easy to change cars in the future with a small mount change. I have had the same rails and crossbars on 4 cars and each car change is generally less than a $60 change in clips, and i usually ebay the old ones. 2 door cars, and cars with built in factory rails also make it tough to fit some racks, or the cross bars end up too close and have stability issues. 

Given the prevelance of the words "optimized performance" in product descriptions, I would conclude that using the "wrong" chain may affect performance, but it wouldn't cause failure. This conclusion is bolstered by this report from a user who switched from HG-X to a non-Shimano chain (the opposite direction of what you're intending): 

Claim the right-most lane that goes straight (don't go into the turning lane). This is probably the safest option (at least for fast riders) because it makes the cyclist very predictable for drivers. Ride in and take the turning lane. This is usually pretty safe at intersections where the turning lane is empty and where there's a wide lane or bike lane on the other side of the intersection. From the perspective of drivers, the cyclist is just sticking to the right-hand side of the road. Note that this is legal in some states but not others. Ride in between the non-turning lane and the turning lane. This works pretty well when traffic is stopped, and you can stop on or near the lane line. Turning lanes are often wide enough to leave room for cars who are turning to pass. Note that this is legal in some states but not others. Go on the sidewalk and wait at the crosswalk. Uncomfortable and inexperienced riders seem to prefer this option, but weaving between the road and sidewalks seems very unsafe. 

Anyone know of a bike trailer that is narrow (like a BOB Yak) for kids? We have a co-pilot trailer, but the width is pretty wide, often maxing out a sidewalk making it hard to pass or be passed. We have twin 4 year old boys and need an easier way to get them to and from school. Its a bit too far for them to ride on their own yet. 

I think there is likely no clear answer. The points go both ways. Yes at speed there is the ability to roll. But also the risk of trauma with a stationary object. Be it an object or the ground. Humans are soft and squishy with fragile bones compared to concrete and asphalt, rocks or trees. 

Talcum powder, baby powder even flour will keep it from sticking to other items or itself. Long term storage you need to worry about the heat. if its older than a year i would worry about it dry rotting. 

Resting. A week out you need to be taking it easy. You dont have time for muscle recovering or time for injuries. Keep it easy, light rides if anything at all. I tend to stay low a week out. My last century i was in the top 75 of 500 riders with this method, and felt great on race day. 

So in your case it's likely that the 48/16 setup will give a slightly higher mechanical efficiency. Also once you've gained the desired speed higher rotational inertia of larger sprockets will help keep the speed at slightly lower effort. On the other hand lighter and smaller sprockets will make it easier to accelerate. However all these changes will be barely noticeable on the road, and especially when the drivetrain is already worn. Some research has been done in the past on this topic, and there are also pages like this one, where the data on resistive forces within the drivetrain can be bought.. 

Self-sealing tubes are filled (well, not completely filled) with a sealant, similar to this used to seal tubeless tyres. When a wheel is spinning, sealant is distributed evenly around the tube, and when the puncture occurs, the sealant should be able to stop the air from leaking. They are quite reliable for small punctures (say, up to 5mmm at a time) but the sealant may lose its properties after a few months so I'd be careful with these. And whether you need to remove the puncturing object, well it depends. If it's small and could progres into a tube it's better to remove it immediately before the hole increases. And when it's large (say, a larger nail) it could sometimes help stop the leak. However there's no strict rule here, and you have to check what works better in each situation. 

In the end, each person must decide what they need and are willing to pay and whether a product provides benefits that they will appreciate. Don't jump to the assumption that other non-competitive riders are wasting their money on expensive crap, but also don't feel guilty if you don't notice or appreciate the difference in weight between two bikes. And if you end up doing longer or steeper rides, you can always change your mind later. 

I adjusted my stem height the other day, and since then, the stem hasn't felt straight. I've attempted to straighten it a few times, but because I'm just eyeballing it, the handlebars don't quite seem right when I ride. (I have similar problems when I try to straighten my saddle or brifters; is this hard for other people, too, or do I just have some sort of alignment-blindness? :) Is there a simple way to make the stem objectively straight instead of relying on my subjective (and wrong) judgment? 

We've spent our entire evolutionary history under the sun, but also aging quickly and dying at young ages. The evolutionary history argument just isn't very compelling. The current consensus is that sunscreen helps prevent skin cancer, and skin cancer is indeed common. On the other hand, I have seen references to theories suggesting that sunscreen might increase a certain type of cancer or decrease vitamin D production, but these do not seem to be widely accepted. An in-depth discussion of this is probably more appropriate for Skeptics.SE than Bicycles.SE. In the meantime, just use sunscreen. EDIT: As heltonbiker pointed out, burning and cancer susceptibility depend on your skin, and most people develop some protection from tanning. I personally wear sunblock during mid-day rides (between about 11:00 and 3:00), when the sun is directly overhead, but I'll leave it off for evening and early morning rides. If you're burning instead of tanning (even if you don't mind the burns), you're probably getting too much exposure and should use sunscreen more often. 

Air pressre in your tyres is very significant in terms of performance; in case of slick tyres it's even more important than width. However it's impossible to arbitrally put any value of tyre pressure as perfect for a given bike. The tyre pressure adjustments can depend on: 

There are also a few rules of the thumb to know how much of the seatpost to leave in the frame. If the limit line is not visible on the seatpost, te safe way is to keep 1/3 of its length in the frame. Although it's more than enough for most models (it's around 10-15cm depending on the length of your seatpost), some more expensive ones tend to have thinner walls towards the bottom, which is why going below minimum is a risk. Also the seatpost should be inserted so that the bottom of the seatpost is below the top tube of a frame (if a given frame has a physical top tube), so the top tube acta against the loads on the seatpost. 

I could have forgotten something, but these are the most important. So to conclude, some of these are really hard to be put in a fixed formula and given numerical values, and therefore it's impossible to say that a given pressure is perfect for a given bike. Even in professional cycling this is usually defined with trial and error method. 

For someone who hasn't been riding much, this climb will be brutal. But you'll be surprised at how quickly you'll make progress. Even though you might fail the first time you go up, this ride seems like a great challenge. Last year I coaxed a friend to start riding again. After a half dozen easier rides, we attempted a mountain climb similar to the ride you're describing. On his first attempt, he only made it about a mile up. On his second attempt, he made it to the top, and on the third attempt, he made it up without weaving all over the road. When you think about it, it's amazing how quickly you can rise to the challenge. It's probably impossible to adequately prepare on a stationary bike because the feeling of a real climb is different. It will definitely help if your aerobic fitness is already pretty good, but a stationary bike can't really prepare you for the feeling that you're about to start rolling backwards even though you're pushing as hard as you can. :) By the way, the gearing on your bike will make a big difference. If you can find a bike with a "compact double" or triple crankset, then you'll have an easier low gear available to you, which will make for a more enjoyable ride. A low gear will let you pedal at a faster rate which will avoid wearing out your knees or leg muscles.
