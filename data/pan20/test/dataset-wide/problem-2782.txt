A computer is a finite device so there is an upper bound on the size of proof that a computer may inspect. There are decidable propositions (in ZFC, for example) whose proofs are of arbitrarily large size. Therefore, no matter how much memory you give your computer, there will always be provable propositions beyond the reach of your experiment. Considering that there are formal proofs (in ZFC, for example) of arbitrarily large size, the "set of all proofs" (if such a thing existed) would then be countably infinite, and therefore no man or computer could produce such a set. No computer can "run through all proofs" because there are infinitely many. Further, it is not at all clear what you mean by "the set of all proofs" - viz. : 

I believe this may be related to the Berry Paradox. The Berry Paradox asks : What is the smallest number not nameable in under ten words? We can answer this by saying "the smallest number not nameable in under ten words". But by saying that we have expressed this number in under ten words - a contradiction, thus invalidating the question. EDIT The reason we can answer Berry's question the way we do is due to the well-ordering of the natural numbers. Every set of natural numbers has a least member. 

You then say "As per my understanding, infinity is fully formed, perfectly symmetrical". This is not entirely correct. Certainly those sets formed by the three principles are fully formed in the sense of being well-defined. However, in the case of infinite sets, these sets are not symmetrical since, for example, there is a smallest whole number but no greatest whole number. Other infinite sets may have a least member and a greatest member, but "in between" there are subsets with no greatest member. It is also important to understand that our intuition of the infinite extends beyond those well-formed sets generated by the three principles to what Cantor called the absolute infinite. These collections are not well-formed. These are inconsistent infinities such as the collection of all well-formed sets. The inconsistency of this collection is witnessed by Russell's famous paradox. 

A lot of different forms of suicides were and are, depending on the culture, socially accepted. E.g. the hero's death: Killing in order to help someone or something else is often considered, be it family member or a nation, to be an honorable act. Though as killing oneself is not the main goal, it is a special case. More to the point would be soldiers and secret agents, who carry around suicide pills in order to avoid a more painful death and not to leak essential information, or even suicide attackers. Also, in some Asian cultures, ritual suicides served as a form to restore one's or the family's honor after failing an important task or committing a terrible offense, e.g. Seppuku. Those forms have one thing in common: They are not only committed for oneself but for others. What you are describing is a person who wants to die because they want to die never minding the consequences. So one could boil your question down to: Is it OK to commit suicide for selfish reasons? Does the person really have to care what others around them think and what consequences they have to endure due to it? You may cause your parents and family sorrow, or your children may be orphaned, yet where does the obligation derive from to not cause them such harm? I for one would allow for such selfish suicide. All I would ask was that the person in question would seek help in order to determine if the person has made up their mind in a sound way. The choice to kill yourself is quite final by definition, so it should be done with extra care. Many people who undergo a suicidal phase feel that their problems are unsolvable, even though they appear quite insignificant from an outsider's perspective, and very much can be solved. So I would argue that we at least try to help those who want to commit suicide to understand themselves why they want to do it. Yet there is no necessity to stop people from committing suicide, and keeping people alive against their will seems unethical to me, simply due to the fact that I can think of situations where I would want to die yet could not kill myself. (Just watch Johnny got his gun.) People are not asked to be born, yet they can control how they die. So for me, I will handle it in this way: "As long as I want to live, I keep on living. If I do not want to live anymore, I will seek help in order to analyse my unhappiness and if it can be resolved. If I understand my reasons and my unhappiness cannot be resolved I will commit suicide", and I recommend the same procedure to others who feel suicidal as well. 

(Original Answer) I am having a hard time pinning down Aaronson's argument, both philosophically and logically. Aaronson begins by arguing that the independence of GC from ZF would imply its real world truth. This is Platonism in the sense that it assumes that GC is either true or false (in the real world), amongst other things. He then turns around and rebuts his antagonist's objection to his Platonism with a non-Platonist argument when he says "why should you even say there’s a fact of the matter about whether something is or isn’t provable in ZF". He is rejecting LEM as applied to ZF, saying there are statements S in ZF such that "S is ZF-provable or S is not ZF-provable" is not true. I do not see the ZF fanatic as facing a predicament. I see Aaronson facing a predicament. How can he defend his Platonist argument with a non-Platonist argument. I have probably misunderstood both the question and Aaronson's argument. My mathematical knowledge is not very deep. I am also not entirely comfortable with his claim that our intuition concerning integers is somehow stronger than our intuition concerning transfinite sets, but that's another question. 

It is not known if the universe is finite or infinite. Although we assume that the laws of physics apply uniformly in our observable universe (viz. homogeneity and isotropy), it is not know if the same rules apply in causally-unconnected parts of our universe. By causally-unconnected, I mean those areas beyond our observable universe, so far away that light (information) has not had enough time to reach us. Big Bang Theory requires no "original matter". Space, matter, and energy were all created in the big bang event. Our universe if often described by supporters of big bang (almost everyone) as the ultimate free lunch. I believe the technical mechanism preferred by cosmologists is some sort of quantum fluctuation where energy is borrowed from "the future". That sounds wacky, but so does most quantum theory. So, in reply to your headline questions, I would say yes, I believe that most cosmologists would be happy to say that our universe is "self-originating". EDIT I should have not said "matter" was created in the big bang event. Only space and energy were created. Some energy would then have become matter when things had cooled down enough. (Recall that Einstein's famous equation declares that energy and matter are the same thing in different forms - E = mc2.) 

I find myself not agreeing with any of those possibilities by themselves, yet agreeing on some on some levels. I think there is no such thing as malevolent intent for a drone, so every damage would be an accident. I hence doubt we could treat such a drone like a human and have it put on trial. An accident then could either be caused by a force majeure, e.g. due to a natural disaster, or be boiled down to technical failure. For technical failure, it would be either the the company's fault for not testing the device enough or the developer's one for making a mistake. The severity would then be determined if it was a somewhat understandable oversight or a grossly negligent act. I think the real question hiding in there is: What kind of security standard do we want to apply as a society on such devices without hindering innovation too much? Or don't we want them at all? If a company or a developer must fear high compensation for damages, wouldn't the rational choice be not to build such drones? 

One of those thing will be true so the statement is always true. Yet is says nothing about the actual ability. Trivial sentences say nothing. So as a different approach, let us look at the term believe. It is often used to convey an assumption. So the statement might as well be: 

Philosophy of science is the science about science, or to put it differently the theory of science. It is a meta-science which determines which endeavors are scientific in the first place and not merely pseudoscience. So basically, it asks what science is. What do we have to assume to conduct science? Can we know anything (for sure) and, if so, what can we know? What rules one should apply in science? Which standard should we adhere to, strict or pragmatic? Is there such a thing as scientific progress? Are there different fields which require a different methodology, e.g.: Can we conduct "physics" in the same way we conduct "sociology"? Can science influence our sense of morality? Can it affect ethics or is that something else entirely? It is a very broad field, and for me philosophy of science is quite frankly the king of all sciences. 

EDIT 30 May 2018 I was reminded of this question when I was reading one of Aaronson's papers over the weekend. I think I now understand the argument Aaronson is making here. Aaronson catches the ZFer on shaky ground when he notes: 

According to Jonathan Barnes, in his book Aristotle, one of Aristotle's ancient biographers remarks that "he wrote a large number of books which I have thought it appropriate to list because of his excellence in every field": there follows a list of 150 books. Curiously, the list does not include all of Aristotle's works. Indeed, it does not include his two most highly regarded works - Metaphysics and Nicomachean Ethics. Of all of the listed works, barely one-fifth (approx. 30) have survived. Again, according to Barnes, most of the surviving works were peharps not intended to be read; it seems likely that the works that survive are made up of Aristotle's own lecture notes and not intended for public dissemination. The two works cited above, Metaphysics and Nicomachean Ethics, appear to be put together by later editors. According to Barnes, Nicomachean Ethics is evidently not a unitary work, and Metaphysics is "plainly" a set of essays rather than a continuous work. Barnes supports his claims by noting that Aristotle's works are, for the most part, terse. "His arguments are consise. There are abrupt transitions, inelegant repetitions, and obscure allusions. Paragraphs of continuous exposition are set amongst staccato jottings. The language is spare and sinewy." These features strongly suggest the lecture notes interpretation. 

According to the paper I have referenced (above) the term “totalize” means to “count as one”, or “count as a set”. If this is a correct interpretation of “totalize”, then Brassier is plainly incorrect in the context of set theory. It is not clear if Brassier is expressing his own opinion or interpretting that of Badiou. The original naive statement of set theory (as per Cantor), which is based on set as predicate, runs into inconsistencies which imply problems with unrestricted “totalization”. However, these problems are removed by the axiomatic formulation of set theory which followed - i.e. ZF Set Theory. This is reflected in the statement : 

No, there is no must per se. There is only a should in order to ensure an outcome, and as you stated, your intent is to retain the capacity of self-legislation. Another question that is hiding in yours is, "Must any freedom be guaranteed?". If so, where does the necessity derive from? And how are conflicts of certain freedoms be solved, e.g. when people use free speech to agitate or spread lies? In the end, it's about values and how those values are prioritized. In Germany for example human dignity takes precedence over freedom of speech and therefore among other reasons Holocaust denial is considered a crime. A constitution reflects values of a society at the time when it was written. It does not ensure that those values remain the same over time. And there may be a time when people will value other things more than freedom of speech and maybe they even want to give up the capacity of self-legislation. You cannot stop that. And then a constitution will be changed. And even if the people would still value those things, you cannot ensure that a political system will remain in place with the help of a text. A powerful minority may use loopholes or start a revolution and proclaim their own set of rules. 

Living beings that can let ideas die instead of themselves had better survival chances. If you are standing in front of a cliff and think about what would happen to your body you might come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to jump if you valued your life. Furthermore, if we assume that there is a universe and that the brain is part of the universe, then your mind also is part of the universe as it is the brain-in-process. So while the simulation of you jumping of the bridge only exists in your mind, there is a physical process taking place in your brain while you are doing it. And while you find it strange that we can conceptualize imaginary things, I would like to point out that our mind is not perfect suited in conceptualizing possible things. I actually built myself a mobius strip and used my fingers to convince myself that a three dimensional shape with only one edge and one area was possible. And once we enter the realms of quantum physics, we can only realize how very limited our brain is suited to grasp the real universe.
