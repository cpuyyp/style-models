NB! by Scandinavian Durkin means "the ancestor varieties of both West Norse (Norwegian and Icelandic) and East Norse (Danish and Swedish), but at a time earlier than our earliest substantial surviving documents for any of the Scandinavian languages, and at a time when the differences between West and East Norse were still very slight" (p. 175). 

At first, some important remarks on animacy. Animacy is more like a continuum, meaning that it doesn't behave like a dichotomy (animate or inanimate) but rather "a more or less continuous category ranging from most animate to least animate" (Croft 2003: 130), cf. Dixon's animacy hierarchy, human < animate < inanimate. This is semantic animacy or what Croft calls "animacy proper." Obviously, it is language-specific. For example, trees are inanimate in Slavic languages whereas they are animate in Algonquian languages (Plungian 2011: 142, n.47). Interesting examples from Russian: trup 'a dead body' [inanimate] pokojnik or mertvets 'a dead person' [animate] (from Plungian) A Wikipedia article on animacy (its Russian version) aslo mentions cases when the same noun can be both animate and inanimate (with no difference in meaning), e.g. virus 'virus' or robot 'robot'. Some examples from Dyirbal (Dixon 1972) non-human animates: some birds, moon, storms, rainbow, boomerangs, some spears, etc. Now, to make things more complicated, this semantic animacy interacts with many other things, like definiteness, referentiality etc. (the extended animacy hierarchy). See Croft for further discussion 

No, not only word-initial though it does seem that it's almost always syllable-initial. There are many examples, assembled at 'a cross linguistic lexicon of the labial flap' by Olson and Hajek. Most of the O&H examples show it occurring in word-initial or intervocalic position, but there is at least one example of it in a consonant cluster (tho heterosyllabic), from Karang (Niger-Congo, Cameroon): /pekⱱekⱱek/ ‘very high’ There is also a single example in the O&H dataset of a word-final occurrence, from Dii (Niger-Congo, Cameroon): /ɓáⱱ/ 'sound of a horse galloping' 

The non-Pama-Nyungan languages with the highest numbers of speakers are Bininj Gun-Wok, Tiwi, Anindilyakwa and Murrinhpatha. 

Regarding the vowel charts in the question, it's important to be aware that these show the phonemic vowels of the languages. When placing vowel phonemes on the quadrilateral they are typically spaced out evenly, as we see in those charts. This is especially so when the vowel systems are neatly balanced, like the ones shown. This should not be taken as a claim that these are the precise values of the vowels. All it really claims is that these are the contrasting vowels of those languages and shows how they contrast. For example: from the chart for French I can see that it has an unrounded high front vowel (represented there by /y/) and another unrounded front vowel that contrasts in being slightly lower (represented by /ø/). A trained linguist, even if they had never before heard French (another weird and exotic IE language I believe), could use these as a rough guide and probably make a fair stab at pronouncing words containing these vowels. As described in other answers to this question, locating vowels precisely on the quadrilateral requires acoustic analysis. This page contains examples of vowel quadrilaterals based on auditory judgement and ones using measurement of formant frequencies. 

Igor Mel'chuk (Mel'cuk 1988: 12) puts it very nicely - the following applies to any syntactic theory: 

When you post a question next time, please mention what theory it is based on. Do not assume that the terms (and implicit assumptions) are necessarily shared and/or easily recognized by everyone. Your OP is a good case in point. It looks like your question is based on Cognitive Grammar. In Cognitive Grammar, 

The last three categories are also known as "composites," as opposed to formulae (i.e. pragmatically autonomous utterances). Mel'chuk 1998 

Interestingly, this entry hasn't been included in Fowler-4 (Butterfield 2015). cf. Michaelis and Jones 1913 or Jones 1917 give one variant only, with [aɪ]. For some reason, it's missing in Walker 1859. Chambers 1861 lists hygiene, with other variants hygieina, hygieine (all with [aɪ]?). 

It has always been rather controversial; "long disputed and now refuted", as the famous Dutch Indologist Jan Gonda (Gonda 1971) sarcastically noted (cited as in Collinge 1985: 16). It seems though it is much less controversial now, at least among IE linguists. But the jury is still out. Kurylowicz, Meillet, and Szemerenyi rejected it (not a bad company?). Even Brugmann himself eventually gave up on it. Paul Kiparsky (Stanford) argues BL is a morphophonological process, not a phonetic law. Lubotsky (1997) summarized its history quite succinctly: 

The invented languages of twins, sometimes called 'twinspeak' are also known as cryptophasia or idioglossia. Peter Bakker of Aarhus University (Denmark) has published on this topic (abstract available here). According to Bakker twin languages are very common, occurring in about 40% of all twins, but soon disappear. Regarding the structure of these languages, Bakker writes: 

The historical linguistics of English is a very significant area of research. The wikipedia page History of the English Language gives a fairly decent overview of the field. As you will see from that page, there has been work on almost every conceivable aspect of English language history, from phonetics and phonology to syntax and discourse. There are numerous books (eg) and journals (eg) that deal with English historical linguistics, substantial corpora available, and very many researchers working in the area. English is almost certainly the best-studied language both in its synchonic and diachronic aspects. 

While I'm not aware of any such place or academics that specialise in constructed languages, it is possible to research them for higher degree studies in linguistics. This is probably most true of departments which have a focus on descriptive/documentary linguistics. I am aware of one person who is doing a doctorate on a constructed language that is used for religious purposes by a group in an Asian country. Being a constructed language (and not anyone's first language) it is not complete, in the sense that there are numerous gaps in what can be expressed (ie things that all natural languages can express). For this reason a lot of the analysis is on the sociolinguistics of the situation that led to the construction of the language and which continues to support its continued usage. It has been suggested that Classical Sanskrit can be considered a constructed language. Classical Sanskrit may be studied at many universities and it is quite possible to do higher degree research on it. 

Since your question is phrased so broadly and there are tons of research on Universal Grammar (UG), I have to write a likewise broad answer, which is nevertheless technically correct: 

At first, you misquoted Wikipedia. What it actually says (the current edit) is that "in the north of the Netherlands and in North Central American usually diphthongized to [oʊ]." The same Wikipedia article has lots of examples when it "stands just by itself." In British English, things are way more complicated. Although [əʊ] is the most common variant now, there are other variants, too; see part 8.10.4 in Gimson's Pronunciation of English (7th ed.). And there are British dialects where [o:] is not diphthongized. After all, in Middle English it wasn't, either. It got diphthongized during the Great Vowel Shift. There are dialects where the glide is a schwa etc. For some discussion based on the material of English dialects (the so called goat test), see Wells, J. C. 1981. Accents of English. Cambridge: CUP. In The Linguistic atlas of England, you can find excellent maps; see, for example, the word "oak" (or loaf, toad etc.), which is not diphthongized in some dialects. 

Just answering your headline question, in linguistics we usually talk about three basic kinds of subordinate clause (what you've called a 'nested sentence'): relative clauses, adverbial clauses and complement clauses. Relative clauses These are clauses (i.e. sentence-like constructions) that modify a noun. The first example in the question 'David hates the lizards who hate David' contains the relative clause '...who hate David', which modifies the noun 'lizards'. Adverbial clauses These modify another clause and have an adverb-like effect, for example: 'He went to bed because he was tired' where '...because he was tired' is the adverbial clause. Complement clauses Complement clauses are clauses that stand as subject or object in another clause, for example: 'I thought that you were going', wherein '...that you were going' is the complement clause. 

Assamese however extends as far east as the Indian town of Tinsukia, around 95º E, placing it to the east of Turfanian. The locations of the major easternmost Indo-Aryan languages, including Assamese, are shown in this map from WP (the languages in yellow): 

The use of motion verbs to mark tense and/or aspect and/or modality is very common across the world's languages, both as part of serial verb constructions or as auxiliary verbs. Below are some non-Indo-European language examples. Sùpyìré, Niger-Congo family. Serial verb construction with the verb sí 'go' indicating futurity: 

Where do I start? At first, there are literally tons of research on this topic (some call them parts of speech, others call them word classes). I don't know how much time you're willing to spend on reading or how linguistically well-trained you are. To be on the safe side, I strongly recommend to start with an excellent review article by Walter Bisang, Word Classes, In The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology, ed. J. J. Sung, pp. 280-302. Oxford: OUP, 2010. Main points summarized here: 

Andrew Radford (Radford 2004) discusses it on p. 351. Go is an unaccusative verb, which means, under Radford's analysis, that the subject originates in spec-VP, unlike in the case of transitive (unergative) verbs, where the subject originates in spec-vP. This is what Radford proposed. However, it doesn't mean that everyone has the same interpretation of the syntactic behavior of intransitive (unaccusative) verbs. David Adger (Adger 2003, Core Syntax) argues that the argument of an unaccusative verb (THEME) is always base-generated in comp,VP - so, at least his analysis is better in this regard because it doesn't violate UTAH. The argument then moves to spec,TP (to satisfy EPP on T).
