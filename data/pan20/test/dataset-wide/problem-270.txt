Well, not colonization, but certainly a research station. There is exactly one location in the galaxy which fits your description - close orbit around the super black hole (~4 million solar mass) which inhabits the center of the galaxy. For a Schwarzchild geometry, there exists an unstable orbit at twice the Schwarzchild radius, with an orbital velocity of 0.7 c. The closest stable orbit occurs at about 3 times the radius, but the orbital velocity is a good deal less. Of course, construction will be a problem, since tidal forces will run several thousand g's per meter of radial distance, so some sort of gravitic control on the part of the advanced races will be a must. And let's not forget the radiation problem. This close to the black hole, infalling radiation and matter will have achieved very respectable energies. 

1) Your planet only has land in a fairly narrow ring around the equator. As a result, the temperatures encountered by the species is uniformly warm. 2) The species is herbivorous rather than omnivorous, and has extremely efficient digestion. The result of 1 and 2 are that fire is not terribly useful, since it provides neither necessary warmth nor much added nutrition as a result of cooking. Consequently, without the widespread adoption of fire, the smelting of metal ores is never discovered. In addition, the cultural development of the species simply never latched on to the use of metal for purposes other than adornment. While this is easy to say, it's hard to justify, but it has a number of parallels in our history, specifically in the New World. The Incas, for instance, did excellent work in gold and silver, but never developed metal (native copper, bronze or brass) for use as weapons or tools, and it's not entirely clear why not. 

This should really be addressed on two different levels. First, can "really alien" creatures have a biology/DNA which is so similar to ours that transmission in either direction is possible? This seems wildly improbable. However, improbable is not exactly the same as impossible, and if the aliens are willing to go the effort of bringing back slaves, it seems likely that the alien biosphere is, in fact, compatible with us. If it weren't, humans would not be able to eat the food produced on the alien world, and it seems a stretch to think that aliens would so prize human slaves that they would maintain a constant transfer of food from Earth. Well, OK, a good imagination provides various possibilities, such as our pheromones being intense euphorics (or whatever the alien equivalent of euphoria is). Or, perhaps, our vocal structure is perceived as extraordinarily pleasing, so humans are kept as the equivalent of songbirds. The list goes on, but it does all seem rather unlikely. Within our own biosphere, the vast majority of diseases are species- or genus- specific, so we (people) don't catch diseases from animals. Exceptions such as toxoplasmosis (from cats), influenza (from birds), or rabies (from any number of mammals) do exist, but they are clearly exceptions. So sharing diseases with something even more foreign than these examples seems extraordinarily unlikely. If you're willing to overlook this, then there is absolutely no reason why disease transmission should be one way. While you cite the experience of African slaves in the Caribbean, the example you give is amazingly one-sided. Europeans sent to West Africa died in droves due to local diseases (primarily malaria and yellow fever, but there were any others such as dengue fever and sleeping sickness) which the locals seem to have had some immunity to. In the 1800's Sierra Leone was called the White Man's Grave. Mortality rates for newcomers often ran to 50% or more in a few months. Finally, consider the strong (but not conclusive) case that has been made for the New World as the source of syphilis, and note especially that the first outbreaks were far more deadly than the current version. 

Virtually everything in Mindwin's answer is wrong. The slowest possible approach of the rogue to the earth would occur with a Hohmann transfer orbit, and in this case orbital energies dictate a closing speed of about 3 km/sec. However, this ignores the gravitational attraction between the earth and the rogue, which will boost this closing speed to about 9.5 km/sec. Time to contact from 10 times the moon's orbit is about 14 days. At this distance, the area of the rogue's disk is about 1/50 that of the moon. Time to impact from crossing the moon's orbit is about 27 hours. A this point tides are about 8 times greater than normal. So, no massive tsunamis until a few hours before impact, and this will affect only small part of the earth. Furthermore, since the orbit is essentially tangent to the earth's orbit, it will appear in the sky at 90 degrees from the sun, directly overhead at dusk, and will present a "half-moon" appearance. Since the earth's atmosphere is about 30 km deep, the rogue will not appreciably affect the earth's atmosphere until less than 5 seconds before impact. No vortex. With a relative velocity near 10 km/sec, a tangent path from sea level to 30 km is about 2,000 km, so for a near-miss the atmosphere will be affected for a duration of (at most), about 3 minutes. No hoovering. Just an enormous shock wave. Since Mars' surface gravity is about 40% that of earth, just at contact the apparent gravity at ground zero will be reduced to about 60% of normal. No floating. And on the other side of earth things get heavier by about 4%. No crushing gravity, I'm afraid. Centrifugal force will be irrelevant, and there will be no swirling water. A head-on collision (well, head to tail) will simply liquefy the two bodies. The collision zone will be, especially at first, expanding hypersonically away from the point of impact. The folks on the far side of the planet will not have to wait a day to feel things, as the shock wave will propagate through the planet in less than 20 minutes. Well, OK, everybody dies. If, somehow, the rogue is thrown into an orbit which meets the earth head-on, the closing speed will be about twice the earth's orbital velocity (plus a bit for gravitational attraction), or about 60 km/sec. This is even quicker and more spectacular. But in the end, everybody dies. EDIT - As trichoplax has pointed out, my calculations on the apparent gravity at impact were wrong. They assumed that the earth and rogue will be stationary, but obviously they will not. Instead, each is in freefall toward the other. The center of the earth is closer to the rogue than a point on the far side of the earth, so the acceleration of the earth will be greater than a person standing on the far side. Since the earth is considered (for the moment) to be a rigid body, that same greater acceleration will apply to the surface of the earth under the person's feet. If not for the attraction of the earth for the person, the two would drift apart. If Re and Rr are the radii of the earth and rogue, and Me and Mr their masses, the net force on a person on the far side will be $$F = \frac{GM_e}{R_e ^2} + \frac{GM_r}{({R_r +2R_e}) ^2} - \frac{GM_r}{({R_r +R_e}) ^2} $$ Letting the rogue be Mars-like, $$Rr = 0.53 R_e \text{ and } M_r = 0.107 M_e $$ $$F = (\frac{GM_e}{R_e ^2})(1 +\frac{.107}{2.53^2} - \frac{.107}{1.53^2}) = 0.97\times \frac{GM_e}{R_e ^2} $$ so not only will people not be crushed by the added gravity, they will be 3% lighter. Just before they die. Likewise, for the point of impact, surface gravity will be 27% of normal. So, still no floating. Just before they die. 

Keep in mind Clarke's Law. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." Time travel is about as advanced as it gets, so the usual rules don't apply. 

Being a natural nitpicker, I'll start off with some of the problems in this scenario. You have left out a few important details about dragons - specifically their size and life/reproductive cycles. Let's say that a dragon grows to 1000 lbs, stays with its parents for the first 20 years of life, then takes a mate at age twenty, and has a reproductive span of 30 years - in other words, more or less like humans. First, dragons must have just arrived on the scene, so the obvious question is: where have they been hiding themselves? And why must they be recent? Because up until (roughly) the 20th century, homo sapiens would have been easy meat for draco sapiens. The rise of technological civilization would have been close to impossible, since cities would have been nothing more than snack bars for the lizards. Worse, they'd have devastated the planet. Starting with a single 20-year-old pair of dragons, in the absence of disease or intraspecies conflict, the population grows like this: 

First, you don't need to worry about the moon "breaking away". That only happens in bad science fiction shows. The moon can be as large as the planet (in which case they become co-planets). In the long run, wicked harsh tides solve themselves - the two bodies become tidally locked. The process of that locking, which is going on today with the earth slowly losing rotation speed, results in the two bodies slowly moving apart, with the separation stabilizing when both bodies are locked. At this point there are no tides on either body. Assuming the two bodies were formed symmetrically, with identical masses and rotation rates, the tides on each body will be identical. If the smaller body is still rotating (unlike our moon), the effect of the larger body on it will be to create larger tides than are found on the larger body. Apparent size of satellite from the primary will depend entirely on the separation, and vice versa. 

To expand further on Samuel and Kaithar's answers, it's instructive to examine the consequences of energy flow the other way. So you've got some poor guy living in "the bubble" for a year subjective. A good rough number for metabolic processes in a human is 100 watts. During his year in fast time, he produces 3 gJ of thermal energy, and this must be radiated out into slow time (if it isn't, the guy roasts). This causes the bubble to radiate at 3 GW for one second, which is unlikely to be good for the surrounding area. At a distance of 10 feet, the power flux is about 28 MW/square meter, or 28,000 times the power of the sun. Larry Niven wrote a story which used the effect, and a sped-up researcher burned off the face of an associate with a flashlight. 

Certainly Waterloo could have been won by a single tank if it went in on the French side. As long as the TC (Tank Commander) managed to keep from getting killed by a stray bullet, a flank attack along the reverse slope of the ridge along the Ohain road would simply have rolled up the British squares. The whole battlefield was only about 2 1/2 miles wide, so a sweep would have taken less than 1/2 hour. Then reverse direction and do it again. Using the main gun on horse-drawn artillery positions is real overkill, but a useful way to make noise, and a useful precaution against some cannon-cocker getting really lucky and damaging a tread. Even if the tank ran out of ammo (and it would) it could simply run over any formation that tried to fight. In Patton's words, "grease for our treads". One of the first lessons out of WWII was that flesh and blood, including cavalry, are simply useless against armored vehicles. I'd guess the big trick would be to do it in such a way as to not panic the French as well. Once you get to, roughly, the American Civil War, things start to get harder. Defenders were learning to dig in, and battlefields were getting much larger. 

I suggest a mass driver, using counter-rotating centrifugal slug throwers. The rotating components are mechanically geared, essentially using a bicycle crank approach. The counter-rotating part, obviously, is necessary to maintain some sort of stability during the pedaling portion of the exercise. As a bonus, differential braking of the mechanism will, in moderation, allow using it as a momentum wheel and controlling attitude, at least in the plane of rotation. Now, for numbers. "some kilometers" is not what one calls a useful number, since it can refer to pretty much any distance from 1 to 100 kilometers (or more). Assuming a "racetrack" involves an outgoing velocity of x m/sec, with the same return velocity and little lateral maneuvering, a delta-v of 50 m/sec suggests a velocity on the order of 15 m/sec, or (roughly) 1 km/minute, for a nominal race time on the order of 2-3 minutes per kilometer of racetrack overall length. Assuming this is intended, a race time of 1 hour implies that "some kilometers" is on the order of 20 km. Note that this implies relatively high accelerations during such phases, in order to keep the acceleration times as short as possible. It is also obvious (or it should be) that placing an upper limit on vehicle mass is pretty silly, since nobody in their right mind will carry more mass than necessary. So let's work with a total mass of 1000 kg. We'll also assume an essentially massless centrifugal apparatus, in order to limit wasted energy in unused rotational energy. Furthermore, just as a starting point, figure on 300 kg for the total slug masses in each phase, for a total of 600 kg and 400 kg for pilot, life support, frame and mechanism. Finally, let's set the radius of the slug mechanism at 1 meter. At the starting gun, the pilot pedals for an effective power input of 300 watts for 20 minutes and ejects the first mass. He then coasts for another 20 or so minutes (pedaling furiously) and then ejects the other, reversing course. Does this work? 20 minutes is 1200 seconds, for an energy of 360,000 J. Rotational velocity is about 25 m/sec. So the ejection momentum is about 7500 kg-m/sec, and the delta v of the ship is about 10.7 m/sec. Coasting for 20 km will take about 1870 sec, or 31 minutes, which is borderline encouraging. The energy of the remaining slug will be 180,000 J, and in 1870 seconds an additional energy of 560,000 J will be added, for a total of 740,000 J. Ejection velocity of the second mass will be about 50 m/sec for a momentum of 15000 kg-m/sec. Since the release of the second mass represents a larger mass fraction, delta-v will be about 37.3 m/sec. This results in a reverse velocity of 26.5 m/sec, and the return leg will take about 750 seconds, or about 12 minutes. So, ignoring other maneuvering, total race time is about 63 minutes, which seems a pretty close fit to the stated requirements. Total delta-v is 49 m/sec, much to my surprise. Of course, this requires the pilot to produce 300 watts for 50 minutes, but this is well within published norms (400 watts for 1 hour). It also implies a perfectly efficient mechanism, but let's figure this efficiency loss is within the output capability. It also implies a fairly high release recoil. This is to some degree mitigated by the fact that slug release will need to be in two separate stages on each wheel, in order to avoid an out-of-balance condition for any length of time, so the return-phase recoil will be about 20 m/sec in two stages, closely spaced. This will clearly require pretty good shock absorbers, but this is left as an exercise to the reader. ETA - A little thought shows that the shock absorber issue is no big deal. Rather than releasing the 300 kg in two (balanced) masses of 150 kg, it's obvious that a much larger number of smaller masses can be used. For instance, if 300, 1 kg masses are employed, the delta-v per release will be on the order of .16 m/sec. This can obviously be spread out over several revolutions, providing a much gentler thrust event. 

You are property. While you were out of circulation, you were declared legally dead. Your estate (including the investments set up to provide for you when you do finally awake) have been distributed in accordance with estate law. The era you awoke to has a very laissez-faire attitude toward some rights which we consider sacred, and in the absence of any property or useful skills, you are bound to indentured servitude to the highest bidder, who will feed and clothe you in return for your services. All of them. For the rest of your life. 

The simple answer is that your system is unworkable, unless. Unless every person has the ability to determine exactly how much magic is contained in a given blessing. As stated, bits and chips are analogous to sealed envelopes which might or might not contain money, and the money contained might be anywhere from a dollar bill to a thousand-dollar bill. Or perhaps the analogy would be with a credit or debit card with an unknown balance. Such a system is simply unusable, and for quite obvious reasons. If, on the other hand, everybody can immediately know the magical balance contained in a blessing, then it simply becomes equivalent to any other commodity currency (see Schwem's answer), except that by definition counterfeiting is impossible. If powerful mages can interfere with the perceived magical content, then the utility of the blessings is inversely proportional (in the loose sense) to the number of bad blessings floating around, just as non-magical currency is affected by the presence of counterfeit currency in circulation.
