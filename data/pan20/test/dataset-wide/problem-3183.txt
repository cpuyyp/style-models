Poland was worried that Germany would again discuss this border after reunification. So the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany from 1990-09-12 once again states explicitly that Germany recognizes its existing border to Poland (German text of the treaty, see Artikel 1, (2)). But even this treaty doesn't describe the border - it simply refers to the existing border because at that point this border was simply a fact. Edit: There was apparently a document defining this border after all. According to the information published by the German government on 1990-06-22 (stated again here) the base for the German-Polish border would be the The Treaty of Zgorzelec of 1950-07-06. Article 5 of this treaty required the creation of a document describing the exact border line. That document was signed by the government of the German Democratic Republic on 1951-01-27 (Akt über die Ausführung der Markierung der Staatsgrenze zwischen Deutschland und Polen). 

So there was no plan to use nuclear weapons in Operation Downfall. The atomic bombs were rather used to end the war before Operation Downfall becomes necessary. That matches what I know from other sources as well. 

I would be very careful with the total weight stated, particularly because the one chest I could find definitely didn't hold 120 kg (then again, nobody says that all chests were of the same size). As to the stated damage, according to this book the source is the Boston Gazette from 30 May 1774. This number is quoted in most other places as well, yet there is another estimate mentioning £18,000. For example, here you can read: 

This quote is being attributed to Winston Churchill, e.g. here: $URL$ The Russian text on that page is literally the one you asked about (and the book you were reading is apparently this one). While it sounds like something that Churchill could have said given the British WW2 history, all the citations have a newer date (starting around 2010) and I couldn't find anything resembling the English original. It seems that the quotation from the book has been recently attributed to Churchill in the public debates on Russia's WTO membership to give it more weight. What seems more likely to be the origin of your quote is this speech held by Stalin in 1920. There is no single quote that would be similar to yours but the overall meaning of the text is just this. In general, I would definitely look for this quote somewhere between the world wars - that's the period where the economical ties between the countries got strong enough that they were an issue in a war. It's unlikely to be something said after WW2: while the economical ties got even stronger then, the political landscape changed and the same thought would have been justified with defense rather than aggression. 

First of all, I don't really see why you think that USSR didn't get Lvov according to the pact. It is true that Germans captured Lvov before going back and letting Russians in (according to a statement by somebody who was in Lvov at that time, I didn't bother looking up online sources on that) but that appeared to be simply a misunderstanding. The German and Russian troops even held a joint parade in Lvov, no sign of disagreements. Stalin's actions in 1939 and 1940 were indeed targeted at restoring the territory of USSR to the extents of the Russian Empire: invasion of Poland, then Winter War against Finland in which USSR captured Karelia (probably less than originally intended, all of Finland used to be Russian province), finally recapturing of Bessarabia and the Baltic states. All of these territories used to belong to the Russian Empire and were given away in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. So getting them back was well-received in the population. But I wouldn't go as far as to claiming that Stalin wanted to revive the Russian Empire - monarchistic ideas in the USSR were a hard sell. The Soviet regime was always expansionist, with the stated goal of a world-wide revolution. It was a good opportunity to get territories back that were "rightfully theirs", so they did it. After World War II USSR expanded its control to a large part of Europe - these countries never belonged to the Russian Empire but given that they already were occupied it would have been stupid to simply give them up. 

The original source for the stories you heard is apparently the book "Scorpion Down" by Ed Offley. The book's statements are questionable to say the least and this book review makes a good point. I checked what the Russian sources say about K-129. This 2008 interview with Viktor A. Dygalo, the commander of the division that K-129 belonged to, covers this topic among others and should be as close to the truth as one can get (at least on the Russian side): 

Still, even after reading this long article one has to ask himself whether the presented interpretation is the only one possible. I don't think that we have much information about the social status of slaves in Ancient Egypt, at least not to reliably distinguish slaves and free people with a social obligation to serve the pharaoh. Even the Harvard Magazine article doesn't seem to fully dismiss the idea that slaves were working on the pyramids - it merely states that at least some workers weren't slaves. Which is what you get if archeology is your only source of information, there will always be much uncertainty. 

This information turned out surprisingly easy to find. The Boston Tea Party museum website lists the following facts: 

I looked some more but couldn't find any other university in West Africa, maybe Fourah Bay College was the only one at that time. 

In other words, the story is very similar to the introduction of the Magna Carta in Britain. We are talking about times before absolute monarchy, the king had to rely on his vassals to enforce his will - all vassals had their own armies that weren't much smaller than that of the king. Support from the vassals was essential when going into war with other countries, and occasionally the king would even ally with some of the vassals against the others. However, in a situation where all vassals were united against the king (and this was apparently the case here) the king had no power to confront them - fighting was not an option, Erik V had to sign. Why this didn't happen earlier: limiting the power of a king with a charter isn't an obvious thing to do, it is very likely that the Magna Carta served as an example. Of course there were other kings after Magna Carta and before Erik V but their interests most likely didn't bring up the majority of the vassals against them. 

The first two points can only be fulfilled if you view the Brazilian war of independence as the point where the "original" Portugal ceased to exist and was split into Brazil and the modern Portugal. You probably recognize this as a pretty ridiculous point of view and I would be very surprised if the Brazilian politicians saw it differently. What you probably mean is "Do Brazilians think that they are worthier successors to Portuguese Empire than Portugal?" This would be an interesting question but I don't think that it is a history question. Or maybe: "Which country has more influence today, Brazil or Portugal?" An interesting question as well but even less related to history. 

Numbers in these articles have to be taken with a grain of salt of course, I've seen articles published before the tower was opened talking about estimated numbers of 5000 people transported per hour which is clearly very far off. But seating 170 people would make an awfully large lift. And finally, Otago Witness, 24 October 1889: 

And while time proved that Poland's fears weren't unfounded (Poland was once again occupied by Germany and Soviet Union in 1939) - it was a war over territory and power, not independence. 

Whether there was immediate danger or not, Australia was still at war - a demobilisation at this point would be strange to say the least. I suspect that you misinterpret Frank Welsh here and the demobilisation didn't actually start in June 1944. What happened instead according to Wikipedia: 

Isaev explains (and the online version of the book proves him right) that Hvalei doesn't actually say that. Instead, he says that his division met Germans after they passed the frontier posts and defeated another division. And Hvalei even mentions where it was: Kelmė, Lithuania. If I read the map correctly, this is around 70 km from the state border (the area around Kaliningrad which is Russia now belonged to Germany back then, this should be the direction from where the German forces attacked Kelmė). The book mentions lots of similar cases. You have to consider that Icebreaker was first published in 1987 and verifying the sources was a lot harder back then. So Suvorov had no problem to adjust citations to better fit his idea. Isaev's book also goes into more general issues. For example, one of Suvorov's core points was that the Soviet Union didn't have any defense plans - only attack plans. Isaev notes that this statement is useless if one doesn't compare to other countries. As it turns out, neither Poland nor France had defense plans - attacking the enemy regardless of who starts the war was apparently the dominating war theory at the time (and likely still is). Isaev also explains how merely comparing the number of tanks and their technical parameters is useless. After all, all these tanks didn't help the Soviet Union at the start of the war. He notes how the Soviets didn't have proper tactics of using tanks at the beginning of the war, unlike Germans who already had lots of experience using them. Isaev discredits a bunch of Suvorov's myths about Soviet tanks, airplanes, lines of defense and many more, his arguments are easy to verify thanks to the internet. But I cannot translate it all - it is probably easier if you ask questions about specific claims Suvorov made. Addendum (2015-12-06): Isaev claims that the Hvalei quote I mentioned above isn't an isolated incident, rather that Suvorov's books are full of falsifications and quoting out of context. I must say that I didn't actually believe that. However, over the past years I had to check a bunch of quotes used by Suvorov - and realized that every single one of them has been modified to better support his theories. Just a single example, a rather spectacular claim from "Suicide" (approximate translation): 

However, after searching through some sources I have to agree with you - I cannot find any post-WWII war that has been formally declared. The last declaration of war I could find was Soviet Union to Japan in 1945. Every war that the United States participated in after that was declared as "military engagement" or "police action". United Kingdom behaved similarly, and so did Soviet Union (I don't have a link but Soviet Union always "restored order" or supported a party on its request). I blame the Cold War, none of the sides wanted to admit that they were leading wars of aggression. Same tendency continues however, see for example 2008 South Ossetia War declared as "humanitarian intervention".
