What came to the stop of my head is a team of cowboys set up an ambush. One guy on the town's fastest steed gets the dragon's attention and the dragon flies above, giving chase. The other team of gunslingers hide ahead with their biggest rifles and shotguns to all take shots at the dragon's soft gut as he get near. "It might not kill him right away, but ain't no thing on Earth gonna take all these holes and just get up and go home." 

So it sounds kinda like what you want is events that can be rigged. Races are an easy, obvious one. Maybe fire spitting can be an event based on distance or accuracy. I feel like taking a dive on accuracy wouldn't be too hard. I'd imagine dragons would want wrestling as an event. While I don't think dragons would have a judge scoring system to result in a time, I could imagine there being rules in place to prevent things gettig too wild: No biting or clawing or fire blowing - something competitive, but it can give an opportunity for the two to show sportsmanship I guess. 

I write centaurs as wild barbarians that love fighting - especially with weakling, little humans. So let's say our centaur and hero are fighting in an open, little, dirt circle in the middle of the a village. Neither of them have weapons or armor or magic spells - all they have is their fists and hooves. They several paces away. And let's assume the human half of the centaur is as strong as a football player (because I don't know how strong a centaur would actually be). How would our hero be able to win the fight? What would he have to do? 

Assuming a modern urban fantasy setting (thus, the world is "ours" in the present time, with the known continents, cities, technology, and general environment), what would happen if a supernatural EMP-like event were to knock out all electronics around the world at the same time? For plot purposes, I need an event able to disable or destroy all manmade satellites (and thus a lot of communication), take down the power grid for (preferably) days, and render communication via cell phones and computers virtually impossible for the forseeable future. Other effects optional! Would an EMP-like event be the best way to do this? If so, what would happen to these specific devices: a) How would cars - from old, non-computerized models up to the Tesla - react? Would they be disabled, and if so, for how long? b) How would hospitals react? Would an event capable of knocking out power on this scale temporarily or permanently disable their backup generators, or would they be able to switch over with little to no disruption? c) Would Internet cables and/or landline telephones be affected, and if so, how? d) If the event acted like an EMP that successfully (and permanently) disabled all manmade satellites, including communications satellites, what would the effect be on cell phones, Internet availability, and general global communications? Would something that behaved like a real-life EMP be able to knock them out for days or weeks at a time, or would the supernatural event need to have a bit more, er, supernatural to get that effect? d) Are there any other major side effects, either on manmade structures or on the environment? e) Bonus: Would this be theoretically achievable with an appropriately-sized EMP or solar flare (thus giving the in-world government a plausible explanation to reduce panic)? 

As someone who likes working monster characters, I thought about this before. What I would do is not make their scales so super invincible. Maybe they'd be highly resistant to sharp weapons but blunt weapons that don't try penetrating could be way better than swords. Maaaaaybe a big enough battle axe could pierce through. I could see someone getting enough force out of it to break the scales. Then there's the obvious weakness of the underside not having those protective scales. Well you were saying that magic does exist in this scenario. I don't see how a dragon could defend against anything magical. I imagine if I were a dragon, then breathing fire would be real tiring. Could you imagine how winded you'd be fighting and blowing at the same time? I tried running and singing before - seriously exhausting. 

I assume that centaurs have the best combination of horse and human organs. Someone was saying that they might have horse-sized human organs too but that's a different story. But if this is what we're gonna assume, then I see no reason they couldn't eat meat AND vegetation with "human" stomachs. I think centaurs would be omnivores. It'd make sense thinking survival-wise. When they obviously need a whole lot of food/water, it'd be a little stupid for them to pick either or. Hunting game like deer could mean a whole lot of meat, but gathering could go with it to fill them up and provide better nutrition. I guess a centaur could live off of plants alone if he's some Chiron hippie-like centaur and doesn't feel much like hunting. 

Let me pitch you a setting... The year is 2017 and economic unreast is everywhere and a gang by the name of "Fukdahrooles" is trying to cause societal collapse. My question being... how could Fukdahrooles cause the collapse of society and make America a free-for-all brawl for terrority Note: here are the limitations. 1: The only source of income they have is the Drug Trade and odd jobs. 2: they are widely hated and are considered a Terrorist Organization (like ISIS). 3: THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. my question is... How could Fukdahrooles cause societal collapse in the easiest way possible? 

Ah entropy, whether you hate it or love it, it's here to stay (at least until someone responds to this question). What I mean by Entropy Reversal: Let's say you drop a cup containing coffee, now. In normal circumstances you would just have to accept the fact that your cup is broken... HOWEVER, since you have an Entropy Reverserâ„¢ you can restore you "broken" cup to it's prior form. My question: How can I scientifically explain Entropy Reversal (within a 2 foot circular radius of the device) I am well aware that Entropy can be slowed down. But what about reversing it? (or bringing it to a halt? I'll go with either). 

You want a giant tortoise that is screwed over by the Square Cube law if I understood your question correctly? Well I have numerous propositions for your. No. 1: The turtles live in an environment with enough Oxygen to sustain gargantuan-sized life forms. The bigger an organism gets, the harder the heart needs to pump in order to get oxygen to every cell in the body (if I am not mistaken). So maybe you could increase the amount of Oxygen within the water, Or you could say that their hearts are more efficient at pumping oxygen throughout their bodies (or you can handwave and say that they don't need oxygen) No. 2: The Turtles are nanotechnologically enhanced. Okay here me out on this one. WIthin the Nanotech community there's a thing called a Respirocyte. A Respirocyte is essentially a artificial blood cell which can store up to 236 times more Oxygen than a regular blood cell can. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ No. 3: The turtles are robots meant to confuse biologists This one is pretty much self explanatory. Anyway I hope you enjoyed my answer! 

Bonus: Would it be possible if the person from another world is not human? Obviously someone who's visibly non-human, like a lizard person or a winged humanoid, would most likely be whisked away for study. But Inu Yasha can pass for human if you hide his ears and claws - would someone like him, who appears mostly human but isn't, be able to successfully gain legal status? 

Being at Anime Expo last weekend got me thinking about all the "trapped in another world" anime I watched as a kid: Inu Yasha, Fushigi Yuugi, Escaflowne, etc. The general plot of these is that a high school girl from "our" reality is magically transported to an alternate reality/time, where she's usually stuck and must perform some great task in order to return. Sometimes, when she does manage to come back, one or more of her new friends (or enemies) from the alternate reality come back with her. In most of these stories, the alternate reality is a fantasy/medieval world with feudal kingdoms and very little bureacracy, so the girl from our world doesn't need any paperwork to go about her business. But the opposite case, when characters from the alternate world come to ours, seems like it would pose a problem for any extended stays. (All the anime I can remember dodged the question, either by having the stay be too short to matter, or by getting a god involved.) A character from an alternate reality who gets trapped in ours would quickly find themselves limited in the same ways as most illegal immigrants, unless they could find a way to somehow get the appropriate paperwork. Would it be possible for someone from an alternate reality to successfully apply for and receive some kind of legal status in our world? If not, what would have to be different in our world for that to work? I'm aware there are already processes for illegal immigrants to become legal residents; however, they're from our reality and have roots that extend prior to their arrival in the new country. I'm curious whether it would be possible to do the same thing as someone who literally did not exist in this world last week. Clarifications:
