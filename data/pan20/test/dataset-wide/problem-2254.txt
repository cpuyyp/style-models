We were in a central European forest last weekend and discovered a few places where a bunch of sticks were leaned against a tree. They build kind of a circle so that it looked like a small hut. However, this can't be the purpose of them, cause they weren't pretty close to each other (so they are holey and thus wouldn't serve as a roof). I've made a little sketch (wasn't able to take a photo :/): 

Is there kind of a checklist what to consider before going on a day hike? Like which preparation should one take, things to pack (not detailed, like "food"), useful information (weather forecast e.g.) and so on.

I would like to have bullet points for 3D archery. I just think that they look better than combo/field tips. However, I was suggested that I shouldn't use them for 3D archery. What are the disadvantages of bullet points compared to combo/field points in 3D archery? 

There was another report recently about a fox sneaking in a house and resting in its living room. Due to the news report it was caused by the extreme cold weather. The fox didn't even bother the man sitting besides it. This happened in Germany but I know a few other similar reports (googled =)). I've a hard time understanding what causes this extreme behavior. Why would a common fox sneak into a house full of humans just to get warm? Is this generally true? Or are these foxes either sick, habituated or tame to some degree? 

As you can see the string "touches" the wooden limb for about 3" on the top. As soon as this happens, the bow is a recurve bow. But what about the shape?! Ah, a nice topic. One might guess that a recurve is shaped in a particular way and that's why it's a recurve. That's (surprisingly) wrong! Note: Before you read further. There are a few more details which make a "horseman bow" different from a "recurve" but that's another topic. Let's examine a so called "horseman bow": 

I've bought it with a right wing clamp. However, I want to switch back to "straight" again. Am I able to just buy a straight spare clamp and use it on the jig? 

Last time we visited Austria for holidays we've recognized devices called "Weiderost" (literally translates into pasture grate). It's a coarse meshed grate laying in the street. It can be found where a fence is crossing a street. The grate kind of connects the two ends of the fence (the fence can't just pass it of course because driving and stuff). We know that it's called "Weiderost" because there were signs telling us so - "Caution! Weiderost!" - every time we came across one. 

As far as I know a wood (for the "hearth board") has to full fill several characteristics (at least they've to be soft) to be suitable for a friction fire. When in a survival situation, how can I determine (quick'n'dirty) if a piece of wood fits the needs? 

Okay, besides the emotional preferences, like "in close touch with nature", fun or personal preferences (and so on), is there any rational reason to pick a bow over rifle? I mean things like "it's quieter and that's good for xy" for example. 

According to Wikipedia, the largest ancient woodland is the "Windsor Great Park" (1777 Ha) :) However, this one doesn't really fit into your description, does it? The next biggest woodland is King's and Baker's Wood (212 Ha). Further information: $URL$ 

Usually I don't have any hiking poles with me when walking. From time to time I think it would be great to wander one or two kilometers with some support while on the track. I then often end up with a crooked, harsh and heavy stick I found in the forest nearby. These pieces don't really satisfy my needs and thus get thrown away soon after. What characteristics should I look for in sticks in the forest to be used as a hiking sticks and where to look for them (which bush, tree etc.)? 

It is possible to repair this bow, but only by a professional. So either talk to the manufacturer (recommended) or a professional (!) bowyer. The crack actually looks a little bit more horrible than it really is. Your bow (or 'modern bows' in general) are made from a stack of different materials like glas, certain kinds of wood and so on. The layers are basically really well glued together under high pressure. What the bowyer needs to do know is just to repeat this whole process. Mainly they'll put in specialised glue, heat and pressure to get your bow up and running again. And again, don't do this by yourself! Send it in. Also don't trust any hobby bowyer. If this is not repaired just perfectly it can get really really dangerous for you, the target (can be ignored if not hunting) and people standing beside. Further information is provided within the comment section of this YouTube video. You can use this link to find all the Samick related ones, like for example: 

I'm currently planning to bare shaft tune a bow. The problem is that I don't have a cutting machine for arrows. These are rather expensive and so it doesn't quite make sense to obtain one for private use. What would be a reliable way to cut arrow shafts at home? Edit: talking about high performance carbon arrow shafts here. ;) 

From Wilderness Survival So, why the heck would you carry an ice axe while walking besides a grass slope? An ice axe could be used as a walking stick. 

I've heard that I've to wax my bowstring. I'm a little bit lost on how to do so. I've a Dacron Flemish string on a hunting recurve. 

In most cases these are very expensive and I asked myself if they're really necessary equipment? Or is it just for "identification"? 

As you've described, your region is quite used to the wolves around. Therefore habituation might apply. 

Hop climbs up other plants or objects. It clasps its target always clockwise. What is the reason for this? Wouldn't it be more efficient to select the direction case by case? 

There were quite a few of them. We've discovered at least three. What's the purpose of such "buildings"? Edit: The room "covered" in those sticks was pretty small. So the shelter theory would only work for kids. Edit: As far as I can remember they were leaned against a pine. At least not against a fruit tree. 

Recently we visited the alps in Bavaria. We hiked near a lake which had a lot of foam swimming on it. It was not spray from the water but rather a really dense dirty foam. Comparable to shaving foam I guess. It looked similar to this (this image is from the internet and was not taken by me while being at the lake): 

We have a bird feeder in the garden and fail to attract Blue Tits. Which food should we put in there? 

I'm new to archery and bought a book. However, the author is often using the term "bow shelf" and I can't really imagine what this might be. So, what is a "bow shelf"? 

Clarification for lay people: Every arrow has a so called cock feather. It's basically just the same as the others but in a different color (not necessary but is a common practice). This feather indicates how the arrow needs to be positioned on the bow. 

I often here hunters talk about "bad genes" when it comes to bucks with a small antler. Is this kind of a running gag for trophy hunters or is this actually true? So, does the size of the antler tell anything about the "evolutionary health" (I really don't know how this is called :) ) of deer? 

I'll focus on the directly archery related things. I think it's quite obvious that the horse is heavily moving and thus you've to learn to absorb this movement in your hips. The main difference is, that you need to be fast. You don't have time to sit in your anchor and focus. You've to look, draw, anchor, release in just a second. Horsebows are also commonly shot over the outer side (the opposing side of your bow-arm) of the bow. The arrow lays on your thumb. The release technique for a horsebow is also different. They use the thumb technique. 

Of course I know that it's an arrowhead to shoot on targets with. However, I wonder how it's exactly defined. So, what (exactly) is a field tip? 

I'm (trail-)running quite often and I'm used to wear lightweight standard running sneakers. However, I feel like they are made for the gym or flawless asphalt. The pitty is that I like to run on various surfaces. I run next to the woods, on field tracks (loose rough gravel or just "earth") and old roads (rough surface with potholes). So, in short, on a trail. I recognized that some surfaces (especially the gravel) trouble the mentioned shoes pretty much. I feel like the sole is too thin. So, what do I have to look for in "all terrain" running shoes? 

I personally don't know any traditional archer wearing a chest protector. I noticed however that Olympic archers (and similar disciplines) nearly always wear one. Which circumstances should make me think about wearing such? 

The "Lech Fall" in Austria is a huge waterfall with a small peninsula on its inflow. This picture gives a nice overview: 

Skinning out deer is complicated when it comes to fiddly parts like the ears. This is especially true for Antelopes. How to correctly skin out the ears of an Antelope? 

Personally I wouldn't use a skiing helmet for kayaking nor vice versa. This post pretty much sums up my personal opinion: 

There is one poisonous: the Desmarestia. The other species should be okay. However, I can't say anything about if they are "worth eating" :) 

First of all: the boots are the most important equipment for snowboarding! It's good to read something about it but please go to a real board-shop before purchasing them! Choose one of those fancy ones where guys hang around listening to punk/rap-music :) 

Am I allowed to bivouac in the German Elbsandsteingebirge (Elbe Sandstone Mountains)? If no, is it considered as a peccadillo/unenforced law (Kavaliersdelikt)? 

Edit: It's really not a "health issue" or something to "hold it back" for about 50 hours. That's even quite normal (for me at least). 

I'm pretty new to skateboarding and I've ordered my first "real" deck. The shop mailed me which ABEC I want to have for my ball bearings. 

Let's say we are about 40 meters away. You'll only see a solid brown surface from the shooting point. 

From "Wick Trailer" (caution, you've to scroll down and choose the 2700 kg version) For reference, there is a guy selling this type of a Granada 24 exactly with this trailer on eBay (actually it's from a trademark which doesn't exist anymore but Wick continues to build them): 

General information Unfortunately the only real way to get your water filter checked is to send a water sample to a lab. You may only want to check whether water is still flowing through, but that's quite obvious, isn't it? An article on Backpacker Magazine sums it up: 

To tune arrows, one should shoot bare shafts (so called "bare shaft test") onto a target. If it's left or right of your "aiming-point", you should adjust the dynamic spine accordingly. I'm afraid that my subconscious will mess up the bare shafts. How can I distinguish "wrong spinned shafts" from just badly shot arrows? 

You are right but often it's a little bit misunderstood. You don't provoke the animal with a short staring - you've to actively stare the animal down. So, I don't believe that your staring was recognized as a provocation.
