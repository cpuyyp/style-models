Essentially this is more about the mechanisms responsible for super-powers as in this case super-strength. The question assumes that the super-strength of someone Superman is purely due to his possessing super-powered musculature and a correspondingly super-powered physiology and anatomy with its various quirks and properties. Superman shall be considered as our typical example. Frankly super-powered musculature exerts all known properties of biological matter and physiology. Although the earliest incarnation of Superman, circa 1938, comes closest to being possible, but even this version of Superman exceeds reasonable bounds that could be achieved by any incredibly strong organism. Consider the fact that Superman can pass among ordinary human beings, as Clark Kent without any sign of causing catastrophic damage. Also, he doesn't any tendency to bounce up into the air as if he was walking on, what for him, would be an extremely low gravity planet. This suggests that Superman must be able to turn his super-strength on and off only as required. This will enable him to all those Clark Kent things without raising any suspicion about his true identity. This also suggests that the source of his super-strength may well be a kind of force-field. Considering Superman's invulnerability can be explained by his generating a force-field it isn't much of a stretch that his super-strength is also due to either a modified operation of this force-field or a complementary force-field in its own right. Note: the force-field concept furthermore explains Superman's ability to lift buildings, ships, aircraft and even catch falling human beings without any of those structures falling or breaking apart when he does so. Superheroes who are masses of super-muscles in the conventional sense will be a menace to those around them. But that limitation is due a failure of imagination on the part of their creators. However, the majority of super-strong superheroes function in a way similar to Superman. It has been established that Superman's super-strength cannot simply be due to his having super-muscles, and there must be a controllable mechanism responsible for many of his super-powers including his super-strength. You may relax, comic book fans, your favourite superheroes aren't walking disaster areas due to uncontrolled aspects of their super-strength. Note: DC Comics has tried to explain Superman's invulnerability being due to a bio-energy field, but that's just too ridiculous. 

Going back to basics. An earthlike planet with dense cloud cover and yet there are plants above the cloud layer. They can be either floating or extremely tall trees. Trees on our Earth have grown to the limit that natural trees can. So we can rule out super-tall trees. Although alien biological engineers might bypass those limits with some unexpected mechanisms. Let's assume a form of airborne algae has evolved on Cloudland (my name for your planet). It should be able to flourish up there. More sunlight, better photosynthesis. Gradually evolving over hundreds of millions to fill all available floating plant niches above the clouds. Conditions will be generally cold, icy and dry. They stick close to the clouds for moisture. Plants need nitrogen for growth. Perhaps there are acidic clouds to supply that. if there are acidic clouds, then there must be something to produce them. Volcanoes? Volcanoes usually eject sulphates and sulphuric acid. Not what we want. Of course! Lightning and lots of it. That will make nitric oxides. Add water and you have nitric acid. Might be better to have your plants absorbing nitric oxides direct, but able to handle nitric acid droplets. There will need to be some mechanism to get the airborne algae above the clouds. A stormy atmosphere? Definitely as Cloudland's atmosphere needs lots and lots of lightning to ensure the floating plants get their nitrogen. What still worries me is the possibility that floating plants need to have densities of aerogels, therefore capable of floating or drifting easily on the wind, and yet might need to be structurally very strong. Perhaps that was a thought I had about your very tall trees. Floating plants might resemble masses of thin fibres as they will need to maximize their surface area to catch moisture, nutrients and sunlight. Rather like thin green netting instead of a bush or tree. This would also reduce their mass per area making it easier for them to sail on the wind. 

This is not improbable. The case can be made by pointing out that the reverse situation has developed on planet Earth where a relatively large sapient species lives in facultative symbiosis with a small less sapient species. This is the relationship between humans and dogs. The evolution of companion animals living in co-existence with a sapient organism is something that could easily evolve throughout the universe especially when both species benefit from the relationship. Basically dogs are stronger and faster, possess better senses of hearing, small and possibly sight, and are capable of defending their vulnerable "masters" from predators. Humans provide food, cooked food provides more energy than raw, and assist in raising of their cubs. Dogs have developed the ability to delegate problems they themselves cannot solve to their bipedal companions. Tests show wolves are better problem solvers than domesticated dogs. But they learned to let their humans take care of the hard problems. There is no reason why a smaller sapient species and a larger less sapient organism could not form a facultative symbiosis. In fact, in the absence of a canine species on this planet, as a hypothetical alternative evolution, then humans might have formed a master and companion animal relationship with elephants. The role of companion organisms and sapient species isn't often considered. If this relationship can arise here on Earth between humans and dogs where the less sapient species is the smaller, then there is no probable biological impediment to a similar relationship arising between a small sapient organism and its larger companion animal. Dogs and humans can share the same habitats. A sapient and its larger companion creature will have somewhat different domestic arrangements. Instead of kennels or even sleeping in the same bedroom, "stables" or holding pens would be attached to houses to keep both species close. Wide streets and footpaths will be essential features of city landscapes. Transportation might present problems. Marine vessels might accommodate elephant-sized companion animals, but few in number. Aircraft would be definitely difficult. However, ingenuity might find a way. 

Firstly there is no such thing as "raw" genetic attractiveness. The attractiveness of the genders is determined culturally. In your question you cite the different levels of gender attraction in a selection of countries. Therefore, depending on social, economic, political and historical factors it is not implausible there could exist a country where men are deemed the more attractive gender. Before anyone claims this is not possible, well the comments to the question are full of persons with these opinions, you should take into account that the relevant expertise to deal with this question lies in the province of anthropology. Thus, moving it out of the zone of primarily opinion-based. The above answer considers the general anthropological factors that might make males the more attractive gender. 

Source: General Xenobiology The fact alone that the range of the weak force is limited to 10^-17 metres and they don't bind anything together in the material sense suggests weak force organisms would have to be extremely small, of sizes far less than 10^-17 metres, probably several orders of magnitude less, in fact, and they would need some other force to hold them together. In summary, this answer agrees with the proposition that: "Weak force lifeforms would be creatures unlike anything we can readily imagine." ADDENDUM: Sometimes the obvious can easily escape one's attention. What environment could sustain such weak force organisms especially since the range of the weak force is so extremely short. There is only environment where matter could be readily accessible to organisms with such a short range. Namely, the interior of a neutron star. Inside a neutron star matter will be within range of the weak force. However, what kind of nuclear chemistry would be necessary to sustain weak force creatures is effectively beyond current knowledge. Although there could be experts who have considered the interactions inside neutron stars to be able to have a good idea of what they are. This, if it exists, will be buried deep in the technical literature. One possibility is that weak force lifeforms will be unable to exist outside of a neutron star. If they can exist outside neutron stars, it will require super-scientific technology on a mind-boggling scale. 

If species evolved on this planet they would have also developed built-in biological mechanisms to enable them to navigate across their world. There is quite a repertoire of such mechanisms. Observing the polarization of the sky, sensing magnetic fields, and celestial navigation turn up in a wide variety of organisms. It is possible creatures on this planet will invariably be equipped with one or more biological navigation mechanisms. This will be essential for their survival. One consequence may be for a sapient species on this planet that they may aware instinctively their world is round, but may lack a conscious cognitive awareness of the fact. They will understand, without having to explain it, that their lives are spent moving in great spatial circles. Each one of which takes nine years to complete. In the same way, we know each season follows, one after another, until the annual cycle of the seasons is complete and continues ever onwards. This would make it virtually impossible for them to conceive that their world was flat. To them this might be an absolute fantasy. However, it could be an interesting moment in their intellectual history when they go from a purely instinctive understanding of being on a round planet and knowing this to be a fact.
