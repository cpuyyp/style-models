Maybe some of the following statements are not precise. Please correct them. Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold. Let $f: M \to {\mathbb R}$ be a Morse function. Then a generic Riemannian metric $g$ satisfies the Morse-Smale condition: for any two critical points $p$ and $q$, the unstable manifold $W^u(p)$ of the negative gradient flow of $f$ of $p$, and the stable manifold $W^s(q)$ of $q$ intersect transversely. Trajectories of this flow that connect $p$ and $q$ will approach to them exponentially. Now suppose $f$ has a degenerate critical point $p$. Let $q$ still be a non-degenerate critical point. Assume sufficient genericity, $p$ is then of "cubic type", i.e., near $p$, $f$ can be written as $f(x) = f(p) + x_1^3 + \sum_{j\geq 2} \pm x_j^2 +$ higher order terms. Now it seems to me that the unstable set $W^u(p)$ won't be a manifold in general, but a stratified space, with the top stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ polynomially(because there is a degenerate direction), and a lower stratum= trajectories that approaches to $p$ exponentially.(Is $W^u(p)$ necessarily a manifold with boundary?) And now, to ask about the transversality of $W^u(p) \cap W^s(q)$, it should be in a sense of stratified spaces. Is there any original paper that discuss this transversality? I know that Floer has two(maybe more) papers: The unregularized gradient flow of the symplectic action; Morse theory for Lagrangian intersections, which talked about the transversality about non-transverse Lagrangian intersections. Indeed his argument can be carried out for Morse theory. I wonder if there is any more original and more elementary argument about this transversality? 

Consider a family of complex curves ${\mathcal C} \to {\mathbb D}$ such that the central fibre is a nodal Riemann surface while other fibres are smooth Riemann surfaces. We choose a family of conformal metrics by restricting a smooth metric on ${\mathcal C}$. So near the nodes (with local models $xy = t$, where $t$ is the coordinate on ${\mathbb D}$), the metric is roughly the restriction of the Euclidean metric on ${\mathbb C}^2 = \{(x, y)\}$. Let $\Delta_t$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the fibre over $t$. What is the behavior of the spectra of $\Delta_t$, or rather the few lowest positive eigenvalues of $\Delta_t$, as $t\to 0$? I (sort of) know in the case of a single separating nodes, the lowest positive eigenvalue of $\Delta_t$ converges to 0 in a rate comparable to $(\log |t|)^{-1}$, while other positive eigenvalues stay uniformly away from $0$. I want to know about the case that the node is non-separating, as well as the case of multiple nodes. The result I look for is not simply the convergence of spectra, but also the rate of convergence of the few lowest eigenvalues. More generally, is there any reference/results about the behavior of the Laplacian spectra of families of higher dimensional manifolds with normal crossing degenerations? 

If the theory $T$ proves (for some natural number $n \in {\mathbb Z}_+$) the sentence $$(\forall y_0) \cdots (\forall y_n) \bigvee_{0 \leq i < j \leq n} y_i = y_j$$ then every mcodel of $T$ will be an interpretation with a finite domain. Otherwise, the compactness theorem in the language ${\mathcal L}(\{ c_i : i \in {\mathbb N} \})$ where ${\mathcal L}$ is the language of $T$ and the $c_i$'s are new constant symbols applied to the set of sentences $$T \cup \{ c_i \neq c_j : 0 \leq i < j \in {\mathbb N} \}$$ shows that there must be infinite models of $T$. 

As far as I understand, no, Vaught's Conjecture has not been resolved. We held a reading seminar on Robin Knight's proposed counter-example closely following each of his drafts and simplified presentations here at Berkeley some years ago and were ultimately convinced that the draft of January 2003 does not contain a correct disproof of Vaught's Conjecture and requires more than minor emendations to produce a complete proof. We did not discover any essential error, though there were important points in the argument where it seemed to us that even the author had not worked out the technical details. That said, it is possible that revisions he has posted since then are sufficient, though in view of how much time it would require to enter into the details of the argument, I am not willing to work through the later papers until the basic architecture of the proof is certified by some other expert. To be fair to Robin Knight, his work in set theoretic topology is well-respected and his construction takes into account the relevant features required for a counter-example to Vaught's Conjecture. If you would like to know whether or not he believes that his proof works, you should ask him directly. If he says that he does believe the proof to be valid, then you can attempt to check the proof yourself. The difficulty in reading his manuscript is not the amount of background material one must know in order to follow it, but exactly the opposite: almost everything is developed from scratch so that one must hold the entire construction in one's mind without having the usual anchors of established theorems. 

Suppose $X$ is a topological manifold and $Y \subset X$ is a locally flat submanifold. We know that $Y$ doesn't necessarily have a tubular neighborhood. My definition of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$ is a neighborhood $U$ with a map $\pi: U \to Y$ which is identity on $Y$ and $\pi: U \to Y$ is a disk bundle over $Y$. The locally flatness implies, however, every point $p\in Y$ has a neighborhood in $Y$ which has a tubular neighborhood. So "having a tubular neighborhood" is a property which cannot be simply glued from local to global. However, I wonder if the following is true. Suppose $Y$ has an open cover $\{Y_i\}$ and each $Y_i$ has a tubular neighborhood $\pi_i: U_i \to Y_i$. Suppose we require that $\pi_i$ agree on overlaps, i.e., $\pi_i(U_i \cap U_j) = \pi_j(U_i \cap U_j), \forall i,j$ Can this condition imply the existence of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$? Or, what should be the correct and natural condition to gurantee the gluing from local to global? 

In a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, $J$-holomorphic curves are special minimal surfaces if $J$ is compatible with the symplectic structure and the metric is induced by $\omega$ and $J$. Minimal surfaces satisfy the monotonicity property, i.e., if $S$ is a minimal surface passing through $p$, then for $r$ small enough, the area of $S \cap B_r(p)$ is at least $c r^2$, for some constant $c>0$ depending on the metric. This property can be used to prove, for example, the removal of singularity of $J$-holomorphic curves, and also, the diameter of a $J$-holomorphic curve cannot be arbitrarily large if the energy (area) is bounded. In Gromov-Witten theory, one also consider perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, as $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$, for other reasons. If just to prove removal of singularity, we can view the graph of a solution as a holomorphic curve in $\Sigma \times M$ (if domain is $\Sigma$), with respect to some almost complex structure on $\Sigma \times M$ depending on $\nu$. But my question is, if $\nu$ is sufficiently small (in $C^0$, for example), can we prove a monotonicity result for a solution $u$ to $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$ (but not its graph)? I suspect this holds because for $\nu$ small, a solution should be close to a real $J$-holomorphic curve. 

To say that $x \neq \varnothing$ is exactly to assert $(\exists y) y \in x$ and the truth of this existential formula will be witnessed by some set $a$ for which $a \in x$. Thus, the set $f := \lbrace \langle x, a \rangle \rbrace$ is a function from $\lbrace x \rbrace$ to $x$. [I think that this point, namely that the Axiom of Choice is not used to instantiate the truth of an existential formula by naming a witness is the heart of your question. I am not claiming that there will be a constructive choice of the witness. It is just that if an existential formula is true, there must be a witness.] More generally, to prove that if $F$ is a finite set of nonempty sets, then $\prod F := \lbrace f : f \text{ a function with dom}(f) = F \text{ such that } (\forall x \in F) f(x) \in x \rbrace$ is non-empty one argues by induction. If $F = \varnothing$, then the empty function is an element of $\prod F$. If $\text{card}(F) = n+1$, then we may express $F = F' \cup \lbrace x \rbrace$ as disjoint union where $\text{card}(F') = n$. As $x \neq \varnothing$, from the calculation above we find some $f:\lbrace x \rbrace \to x$. By induction, there is some $g \in \prod F'$. I will leave it to you to exhibit a bijection between $\prod F$ and $(\prod F') \times \prod \lbrace x \rbrace$ and thereby complete the argument. 

There are several rich theories of analysis on non-archimedian theories. Neal Koblitz' book on $p$-adic analysis is a good introduction. Non-archimedian analysis by Bosch, GÃ¼ntzer and Remmert is more encyclopedic. Berkovich's Spectral Theory and Analysis over Non-archimedian Fields introduces his beautiful theory of analytic spaces allowing for a reasonable algebraic topological theory. In Goss's book Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic there is a good introduction to analysis in positive characteristic. Your suggestion that this subject might have something to do with model theory is apt. As the above references show, the theory may be developed without model theory, but it has been studied intensively via model theory giving interesting results about quantifier elimination, uniformity across the $p$-adics, and establishing a basis for motivic integration. You might want to look at the paper by van den Dries and Denef, $p$-adic and real subanalytic sets. Ann. of Math. (2) 128 (1988), no. 1, 79--183. 

Suppose $F: {\mathbb C}^N \to {\mathbb C}$ defines a singularity at the origin (for simplicity one can assume that $F$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial). Suppose it is nondegenerate, i.e., $dF(z) = 0$ only at $z = 0$. Let $D_i \subset {\mathbb C}^N$ be the divisor defined by $\partial_i F$. My question is: is there a natural condition on $F$ to guarantee the following (or can we prove the following under the nondegenerate condition): For any $I \subsetneq \{1, \ldots, N\}$, $F$ doesn't vanish identically on (any component of) the intersection $$\bigcap_{i \in I} D_i.$$ 

I think the recent work by Huagui Duan and Yiming Long $URL$ showed the existence of at least two closed geodesics. 

When considering the heat kernel of a Schr\"odinger operator $$- \Delta + V(x) $$ where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian on ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $V$ is a nonnegative potential function that has nice behavior at infinity (proper, grows polynomially), one usually sees the term $$e^{-tV(x)}$$ and the asymptotic expansion of the Gaussian integral $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^n} e^{-t V(x)},\ t \to 0.$$ If $V(x)$ is homogeneous, namely, $V(rx) = r^\alpha V(x)$, the above integral is just a power of $t$ (in particular, no log term). However it seems that in more general case when $V(x)$ is not homogeneous, for example, when $$V(x, y) = V_1(x, y) + V_2(x, y)$$ which is the sum of two homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, the expansion may have $\log t$ terms. Question: What is the general form of the asymptotic expansion of this integral as $ t\to 0$? 

We know that a mixed Hodge structure on a complex vector space $H$ with an integral lattice $H_{\mathbb Z}$ consists of the weight filtration and the Hodge filtration. For an isolated hypersurface singularity represented by a function germ $f: ({\mathbb C}^n, 0) \to ({\mathbb C}, 0)$, we have the vanishing cohomology bundle $${\mathscr H}^* = \bigcup_{t \in {\mathbb D}^*} H^{n-1}(V_t; {\mathbb C}) \to {\mathbb D}^*.$$ Here $V_t = f^{-1}(t)$. A mixed Hodge structure can be defined on the fibres of ${\mathscr H}^*$. Let $\{{\mathscr F}^p\}_{p=0}^n$ be the Hodge filtration. The integral lattice is spanned by the parallel integral cocycles with respect to the Gauss-Manin connection. A simple case is that when $f$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial. Suppose $d_1,\ldots, d_n, D$ are integers such that $$f( t^{d_1} z_1, \ldots, t^{d_n} z_n) = t^D f(z_1, \ldots, z_n).$$ Denote $\nu_i = d_i / D$. Then for the holomorphic $n$-form $\omega = z_1^{k_1}\cdots z_n^{k_n} dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n$, we have the so-called ``geometric sections'' of the cohomology bundle, whose value at $t$ is the residue form $$\big[\frac{\omega}{df}\big]|_{V_t}.$$ This section belongs to ${\mathscr F}^p$ if and only if the charge of $\omega$, given by $l = \sum_{i=1}^n (k_i+1) \nu_i$, is less than or equal to $n-p$. (One can refer to the book ``Singularity I'' of Arnold etc.) Here is the question: for quasi-homogeneous singularity, what is the complex conjugation of a geometric section (which can be given explicitly)? In the paper "${\mathcal N}=2$ Landau-Ginzburg vs. Calabi-Yau $\sigma$-models: non-perturbative aspects" by S. Cecotti, there is a physics description of this complex conjugation on page 1766 which I don't quite understand (especially the term of ``spectral flow''). Is there any mathematical literature which contains such discussion? 

As you point out, it follows on general grounds that there is an extension of $v_p$ to a valuation on ${\mathbb R}$ (in fact, there are uncountably many such extensions), but it is impossible to give an "explicit" description. Indeed, not only will any such extension by discontinuous with respect to the usual Euclidean topology on the reals, but it will not be a measurable function. 

I think that the simplest explanation has nothing to do with schemes: the first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a fixed characteristic is complete. The assertion that the group of $k$-points $G(k)$ of the algebraic group $G$ has $n$ orbits on the set of $k$-points $X(k)$ of the algebraic variety $X$ may be naturally expressed as a first-order logical formula and hence is true in one algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$ just in case it is true in every such algebraically closed field. 

As you point out, one cannot hope that the Witt ring, up to isomorphism, be an elementary invariant of a field. The strongest statement which I might conjecture would be that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then $W(K) \to W(L)$ is an elementary extension of rings. If this statement were true, then the theory of the Witt ring would be an elementary invariant as any two elementarily equivalent fields have a common elementary extension. It is true that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then map $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is an inclusion [Why? Being zero in the Witt ring is defined by an existential condition.] One might try to prove that $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is elementary by induction where the key step would be to show that if $W(L) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$ where $a$ is a tuple from $W(K)$, $x$ is a single variable, and $\phi$ is a formula in the language of rings, then $W(K) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$. The witness in $W(L)$ would be represented by a quadratic space of some finite dimension $n$. One would like to argue that the set defined by $\phi(x;a)$ in the space of $n$-dimensional quadratic forms is definable in the field language in $K$ in which case a witness could be found in $K$ via elementarity. This last part of the argument is delicate as it would require knowing bounds for checking equalities in the Witt ring. The Witt ring construction is an example of an ind-definable set modulo an ind-definable equivalence relation. These are discussed in some detail in Hrushovski's paper on approximate groups ( arXiv:0909.2190 ). With Krajiceck, I considered similar issues (how does the Grothendieck ring of a first-order structure depend on its theory) in Combinatorics with definable sets: Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings. Bull. Symbolic Logic 6 (2000), no. 3, 311--330. 

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $G$ be a compact Lie group. Suppose we have a Hamiltonian $G$-action on $M$, with moment map $\mu: M \to {\mathfrak g}^*$. We assume that the moment map is proper in case $M$ is noncompact. The question is: for any loop $\gamma: S^1 \to G$, and a point $x\in M$, is the loop $t\mapsto \gamma(t) x$ a contractible loop in $M$? So we assume neither $G$ or $M$ is simply-connected. We may assume that $\gamma$ is actually a 1-parameter subgroup of $G$, generated by a vector $\xi \in {\mathfrak g}$. In the case $M$ is compact, we restrict the moment map to this subgroup, which is equivalent to a real valued function $\mu_\gamma$. Then the gradient flow of this function should push the loop to a critical point, which is a fixed point of this subgroup. Hence this shows that the loop is contractible. Now if $M$ is noncompact, the gradient flow doesn't necessarily converge to a critical point (could escape to $\pm \infty$). Note that the real valued function $\mu_\gamma$ is not necessarily proper. So the above method fails. But I still guess that the loop should be contractible. Is there any proof or counter-example? Or should we add some conditions to guarantee this? 

Consider the Lagrange multiplier $$F(x, t, c) = f(x) + t( g(x) - c).$$ If $g$ satisfies your condition and $f$ is generic, then one can show that $$S:= \{ (x, t, c)\ |\ \nabla f(x) + t \nabla g(x) = 0,\ g(x) - c = 0 \}$$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Its intersection with $c= a$ or $c= b$ are the critical point set of $f|_{g=a}$ and $f|_{g= b}$. This implies that (if $a$ and $b$ are generic), then the mod 2 counting of the two critical point sets are equal. In your counter-example, the $g = 0$ slice corresponds to a so-called "birth-death" which is not generic.
