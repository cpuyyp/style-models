I got this puzzle some time ago and it has been bugging me since, I cant solve it - but it is supposedly solvable, I am interested in a solution or any tips on how to proceed. In front of you is an entity named Adam. Adam is a solid block with a single speaker, through which he hears and communicates. For all propositions (statements that are either true or false) $p$, if $p$ is true and logically knowable to Adam, then Adam knows that $p$ is true. Adam is confined to his physical form, cannot move, and only has the sense of hearing. The only sounds Adam can make are to play one of two pre-recorded audio messages. One message consists of a very high note played for one second, and the other one a very low note played for one second. Adam has mentally chosen a specific subset of the Universe of ordinary mathematics. The Universe of ordinary mathematics is defined as follows: Let $S_0$ be the set of natural numbers: $$S_0 = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$$ $S_0$ has cardinality $\aleph_0$, the smallest and only countable infinity. The power set of a set $X$, denoted $2^X$, is the set of all subsets of $X$. The power set of a set always has a cardinality larger than the set itself, $$|2^X| = 2^{|X|}$$ Let $S_1 = S_0 \cup 2^{S_0}$. $S_1$ has cardinality $2^{\aleph_0} = \beth_1$. Let $S_2 = S_1 \cup 2^{S_1}$. $S_2$ has cardinality $2^{\beth_1} = \beth_2$. In general, let $S_{n+1} = S_n \cup 2^{S_n}$. $S_{n+1}$ has cardinality $2^{\beth_n} = \beth_{n+1}$. The Universe of ordinary mathematics is defined as $$\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty S_i$$ This Universe contains all sets of natural numbers, all sets of real numbers, all sets of complex numbers, all ordered $n$-tuples for all $n$, all functions, all relations, all Euclidean spaces, and virtually anything that arises in standard analysis. The Universe of ordinary mathematics has cardinality $\beth_\omega$. Your goal is to determine the subset Adam is thinking of, while Adam is trying to prevent you from doing so. You are only allowed to ask Adam yes/no questions in trying to accomplish your task. Adam must respond to each question, and does so by playing a single note. After Adam hears your question, he either chooses the low note to mean yes and the high note to mean no, or the high note to mean yes and the low note to mean no, for that question only. He also decides to either tell the truth or lie for each question after hearing it. If at any time you ask a question which cannot be answered by Adam without him contradicting himself, Adam will either play the low note or the high note, ignoring the question entirely. Adam has given you an infinite amount of time to accomplish your task. More specifically, the set of both questions asked by you and notes played by Adam can be of any cardinality. If in your strategy this set is uncountably large, for any number of possibilities of Adam's chosen subset, you must describe the order that the elements of this set take place in as completely as possible. During your questioning, you are keeping track of the following numbers: $B_1 = $ The number of questions in which Adam had the option of truthfully responding in the affirmative. (This number and the following numbers can of course be cardinal numbers.) $B_2 = $ The number of questions in which Adam had the option of truthfully responding in the negative. $B_3 = $ The number of questions in which Adam had the option of falsely responding in the affirmative. $B_4 = $ The number of questions in which Adam had the option of falsely responding in the negative. $B_5 = $ The number of questions in which Adam responded with the high note. $B_6 = $ The number of questions in which Adam responded with the low note. $B_7 = $ The number of questions. Let $C = B_1+B_2+B_3+B_4+B_5+B_6+B_7$ A strategy exists which will eventually allow you to determine Adam's chosen subset. Describe such a strategy in which $C$ is as small as possible, for all possibilities of Adam's chosen subset. 

Im not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but try searching google for the "dimension growth conjecture". This is essentially the conjecture that $N(X,B) \ll_{d,\varepsilon} B^{dim X + \varepsilon}$ for any projective variety $X$ of degree $d \geq 2$. I think this is now known for any variety whose degree is not three. This follows from work of Heath-Brown, Browning, Salberger, Marmon and others. Also, Salberger has recently announced a proof for the case of degree three, however the implied constant is not uniform with respect to $X$. These results are generally proved using a higher dimensional analogue of the determinant method of Bombieri and Pila, in particular Heath-Brown has developed a $p$-adic version of the determinant method that has proved fruitful. You might be able to use this to get the kind of result that you are looking for. For an overview of these results I would recommend: $URL$ 

In good cases, the ''isomorphism functor'' $\mathrm{Isom}(X,Y)$ is representable by a scheme. Hence, you are asking that if this scheme is non-empty (i.e. contains a geometric point), whether it contains a solvable point. So your problem is more-or-less equivalent to the usual open problem that every variety contains a solvable point. Now for your special cases. If $X$ and $Y$ are curves of genus $1$, then $\mathrm{Isom}(X,Y)$ is a torsor under $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$. In particular, to find a solvable point on it, one quickly reduces to finding a solvable point on some torsor of the Jacobian of $X$, i.e. some curve of genus $1$, which equivalent to the original problem. For curves of higher genus, the scheme $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ will be finite, so you reduce to the easier problem of asking whether this is a solvable group (you should be able to find counter-examples to your question here, if e.g. $\mathrm{Aut}(X_{\bar{\mathbb{Q}}})$ is a simple non-solvable group, which occurs if $X$ is the Klein quartic, say). Moreover here, in general, $X$ won't have a twist that contains a rational point (e.g. this happens if $X(\mathbb{Q}) = \emptyset$ and $\mathrm{Aut}(X)=\{\mathrm{id}\}$). So it seems that your approach to solving this conjecture is also doomed to fail here. 

I'm trying to understand the relationship between the different models of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not equal to $2$. Usually, del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$ are considered as hypersurfaces of degree $4$ in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,2)$: $$S: \quad w^2 = f(x,y,z)$$ with $\deg f = 4$. There are however other natural models, such as hypersurfaces of bidegree $(2,2)$ in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^2$: $$q(s,t,x,y,z) = 0,$$ where $q$ is bihomogeneous of degree (2,2) in $(s,t)$ and $(x,y,z)$, respectively. Call these models of type $1$ and $2$, respectively. I'm trying to understand how one goes between these different models. 

I found a proof and post it here for completeness/further reference. Suppose $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map $h \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$. Abbreviate $g_0 = f \circ g^{-1}$. Let $[g_0]_*$ and $[h]_*$ denote the induced maps $\Gamma_g \rightarrow \Gamma_f$ on the fundamental groups. Suppose the isotopy is realized by homeomorphisms $G_t$. Then the induced maps $[G_t]_* \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ depend continuously on $t$ and, hence, must be the same for all $t$. In particular, $$[g_0]_* = [G_0]_* = [G_1]_* = [h]_*.$$ Fix a compact fundamental domain $F$ for $\Gamma_g$ in $\mathbb{H}$. Let $g_0^*$ and $h^*$ be lifts of $g_0$ and $h$, respectively. Given any $w \in \mathbb{H}$, take $\gamma \in \Gamma_g$ and $z \in F$ with $\gamma(z) = w$. Then $$ d(g_0^*(w),h^*(w)) = d(g_0^* \circ \gamma(z),h^* \circ \gamma(z)) = d([h]_*(\gamma) \circ g_0^*(z),[h]_*(\gamma) \circ h^*(z)) = d(g_0^*(z),h^*(z)). $$ Since $F$ is compact, we see that $ d(g_0^*(w),h^*(w)) $ is uniformly bounded in $\mathbb{H}$. As discussed in the question, we have $h' \circ \overline{g_0^*} = g_0^*$ on $\mathbb{H}$ for some conformal map $h'$. The uniform bound tells us that $h' \circ \overline{g_0^*}$ and $h^*$ are the same on $\partial \mathbb{H}$. Thus, $\overline{g_0^*} = h'^{-1} \circ h^*$ is a M{\"o}bius transformation on $\partial \mathbb{H}$ that fixes 0, 1 and $\infty$, i.e. it is the identity on $\partial \mathbb{H}$. Lastly, we only need to see that $\overline{g_0^*} = \overline{f^*} \circ (\overline{g^*})^{-1}$. 

Let $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{C}$ be the upper half plane. First recall the following statement: if $f^* \colon \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ is quasi-conformal (qc), then there exists an extension $\overline{f^*} \colon \overline{\mathbb{H}} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{H}}$ of $f^*$. Note that this is an extension in the following sense: we do not (neccessarily) have $\overline{f^*} = f^*$ on $\mathbb{H}$ but they are conformally eqiuvalent, i.e. they are equal after composing with a conformal map. Now fix a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ so that $\mathbb{H} / \Gamma$ is a compact Riemann surface. A qc map $f \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ to some other Riemann surface has a qc lift $f^* \colon \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$. This map has an extension $\overline{f^*}$ in the sense above. After composing it with a conformal map, we can assume that $\overline{f^*}$ fixes 0, 1 and $\infty$. By a version of the measurable Riemann mapping theorem for the upper half plane, this map $\overline{f^*}$ is then unique. I am intersted in the following statement: for two qc maps $f \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ and $g \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g$ with the same domain but possibly different images we have the following: the composition $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map if and only if the lift extensions $\overline{f^*}$ and $\overline{g^*}$ agree on the real line. I proved the backwards direction but assuming that $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map, I do not know how to deduce equality of the extended lifts on $\mathbb{R}$. Remark: I do not know for sure whether the statement is true but I stronly believe so. Cheers!
