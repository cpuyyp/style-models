Either should be fine providing you use them in the correct context. Their jobs are to provide extra grip in minimal winter conditions. If there are patches of ice and your hiking on easy ground. If you intend on going on steep terrain and/or full winter (compacted snow, etc) then you will need at least a C1 level Crampon and B1 Boot system. Snow spikes are not an adequete replacement for a proper Crampon, ice axe system and the knowledge to use them correctly. 

I'm not that clear what you mean by 100%, but in general you should be looking to perform 10-15sec dead hangs (4 sets with 5 minutes rest in between). You want to hold on until failure. If you hold for longer than 10 seconds then use a smaller hold, less than 10seconds find a bigger hold, etc. You want a position similar to the right on this image: 

That phenonmon is called a cloud inversion. It happens in mountainous areas when a layer of warm moist air passes over cold valley floor. So initially the valley is full of cold air: 

It's easier to get a fine powder accidentally into your food, water, etc. then a solid block so be careful withhow and where you store them 

This was actually something new I came across recently. A Czech bed roll. I've never seen a set up like this before. I was also intrigued by the name. Has anyone used one of these? Advantages/disadvantages? Why are they called Czech bed rolls? Especially the Czech bit? Edit Yes, I know the example I tagged was Czech army surplus. I am more interested in the history/usage of these things. The post I came across this on refereed to this as a more generic title. 

I'm having some trouble with my Gri-gri. It seems to keep "jamming" when feeding out rope. It's causing me so much trouble I've basically stopped using it and gone back to a good old fashined belay plate. I'm totally unsure what I'm doing wrong, any thoughts? I do wonder if it's my rope, it's relatively thick 10.5mm. Could this be the problem? 

A friend of mine disturbed a bird of prey (I think it was a kestrel or sparrow hawk) that had just killed a pigeon in her back garden. The pigeon was still alive when she found it but died soon after. If she leaves the pigeon out will the bird of prey return or is it too late now? 

I was talking to a friend on my lunch today about visiting the Tatra mountains in Poland and he said that an issue was the lack of mountain rescue if you get into trouble. Is this true, there is no Mountain Rescue organisation in Poland/Tatra mountains. What would you do in an Emergency instead? 

Now that said UK right of way seems to trump this. So if you're on a right of way (footpath) etc. then you can observe the birds from there. But if you set foot off the footpath then you'd be breaking the schedule one restrictions, so this is going to make it difficult to find a good location. Also note the restriction on not disturbing the bird. This seems purposely open ended. You could argue that your not causing a disturbance by simply photographing them. You might be on shaky ground here unless your in a good hide, etc. as I would guess even scaring the birds would count as disturbance. But then how do you hide if you can't leave the path! A good thread on the subject here. Probably your best bet to photograph a kingfisher is to visit a RSPB reserve 

I have found the differences are mostly subconscious, and a matter of personal preference. Black blocks your widest of peripheral visions. You almost never look out that far, but your brain does process it. Clear silicone masks instead blur that part of your vision, permitting you to see rough outlines and colors. Some people find the black masks constricting, others (like myself) find it improves their focus. Some people find the clear masks increases their feelings of immersion, others (like myself) find they're distracting. Definitely try both styles at the store, and try to feel which one is best for you. 

For all the reasons in the other answers, one probably should not ask to be belayed by another group of climbers. There's just a lot of awkwardness involved, and a lot of strange risk in trusting someone with your life. However, if you do want to try to get belayed by others, don't be afraid to use a social approach. Go up to groups and chat with them a bit, show your interest both in the climb and in them. There's a reasonable chance they will offer to let you join, if you play it right. And if they don't, you still spent your time networking with the climbing community. Who knows what you might learn! 

For a long time, there was a trend towards heavier shoes with more support. The logic was that it provided protection for your joints, and your anecdotal evidence suggests that it works. Bear with me for a moment, and permit me to take the argument to an unreasonable extreme. Encase you entire foot in a solid steel block, well up into the calf. Now you can prove without a question that you're protecting your ankle. Obviously that extreme example is unrealistic, but it does demonstrate that the "best" answer has to be a balancing act. Clearly there are advantages to support, and disadvantages to support. Otherwise we would all be either barefoot or wearing steel boots. One of the issues with the heavy boots I have identified is that they encourage dependence on them. There is a set of skills your body needs to practice to keep itself stable without relying on ankle support. If you always have heavy boots on, that skill (and its associated muscles) atrophies. As you mentioned, you found it horrible to try to go even a short distance with lightweight shoes. On the other hand, if you have light shoes, you are obliged to maintain stability, and will damage your body if you don't. If you're the kind of person that likes to get distracted and let their body do all the walking, you'll likely put yourself in a bad position with a high likelihood of ankle damage. Another issue is shock. If you have intentionally restricted motion of the ankle joint, you lose the ability to cushion blows using those tendons. The force is naturally taken up by the ankles and hips. Do you naturally walk on your heels? Then you probably will find that that ankle restriction really doesn't impact you all that much. If you naturally walk closer to the balls of your feet, losing that mobility has a much larger impact. In the end, the best answer is to do what is comfortable for you, but don't be afraid to explore outside of the box a bit. Your definition of comfortable may move. Personally, I like hiking with lightweight shoes. However, if you look at the military, who have to make tremendous slogs with heavy packs without twisting an ankle, they're all in high-support shoes for good reason. I don't think we'll see our armed forces deploying in Vibram toe shoes any time soon! 

You get frustrated because your not climbing at your ability which make your more anxious which makes you push yourself, which makes matters worse, repeat. STOP, go for a boulder, relax, enjoy yourself, the wall's not going anywhere and you can come back whenever you want. Your supposed to be enjoying this! 

Bear in mind also that the idea of protecting wild areas is a recent one. Yosemite in america being the first one. By this point almost all of the UK was already being intensively farmed. 

I live in a relatively rural area of North Wales in a new build house. I've been trying to encourage birds into our garden with limited success. There are plenty of birds in the area just not many in our garden! The problem is I can't make any radical changes to the garden as it's a rented house. 

My girlfriend and I went for a walk on Sun. We climbed 3 peaks in Snowdonia. My girlfriend had one of them Nike tracking apps running on her phone all the while. In the end it gave us these stats: 

On the spur of the moment I bought a flint and steel. This was mainly because it seems manly and cool. My main problem is I really struggle to light a fire with the thing and normally give up and use a lighter instead. Can someone give me some pointers to lighting a fire successfully using a flint and steel? 

I was recently at a music festival in a field here in the UK. It was a nice hot day and I was staring up into the lovely blue sky. I noticed there were high numbers of seagulls circling above, seemingly riding thermals to a great height (they quickly became speks in the sky). I started wondering, what are they up to? I couldn't make sense of it. If they were riding the thermals as a mode of transport, they didn't appear to be going anywhere (just round and round in circles). It didn't make sense that they were doing it to spot food either (that I thought). There was plenty of food about, but none of them appeared to be making any attempt to come down. It almost appeared that they were simply riding the thermals for fun. So why would these birds by seemingly riding thermals for no reason? 

To toughen up the skin on your hands you want to be climbing or generally doing things that scuff up the skin (i.e. exercises already suggested above). There really isn't any short cuts to this. Just keep working on it and it will get better. Tough skin is great it stops your hands tearing up on rough terrain/rock. But your skin can be too tough. You also want to try and keep you skin "even". Build up of callouses will be counter productive to you skin as they tend to come off and form "flappers". See this related question How to take care of climbing hands? 

I have recently started trying out the backpackinglight.com mantra of a tarp and a water resistant breathable top bivy bag with a waterproof bathtub bottom (basically a shrunk inner tent). Assuming it is fairly dry, I think it is best to keep the pad outside the bivy bag on the groundsheet so the bivy is lifted off the ground and the bottom of it is slightly warmer, hopefully reducing condensation inside (- breathable or not, some will appear). I was wondering whether anybody had any opinions, arguments or experiences there? Thank you. 

I would generally agree with the "as few as possible approach", but would add that if it is a question of safety or avoiding lots of time wasted (which in turn may morph into a safety issue), then I think markers can be helpful. But I don't think it should be exaggerated - markers can be used instead of cairns. For example in Vistasvaggi (Vistas Valley) in North Sweden, there are fairly inconspicuous markers in the form of two half buried brick-sized red-brown rocks close to each other. I didn't understand they were markers until I had seen a few. Of course you can argue it is hard to get lost even in a wide valley and it certainly is at large scale, but I found it helpful to get the detail right when going over soggy ground, tired and damp. 

Agree with ppl, don't think it is a big problem, but even for variable filling bags it could mean that some of that expensive down may not be used the way you would prefer. A quilt may be a bit draugthy if you are not careful. I find the bottomless bags work well for 3 seasons. An(other) option there is a Rab "Backless" bag; have tried the predecessor, the Q-Top. Alternatively one could sew in a piece of thin nylon fabric under a quilt fairly easily. What I really wanted to add was that if you don't squirm around too much at night, the best all-rounder might be a sleeping bag without baffles in the rings of fabric you lie inside, ie. only baffles in the head-toe direction (Western Mountaineering calls it "continuous baffle" design). With those you are free to turn it upside down and shake all or as much of the down as you like to the top part of the bag. So the same bag could be bottomless or have slightly more insulation underneath, depending on what you need. 

For butane/isobutane/propane canisters, the stove design, affecting the temperature in the canister or liquid feed pipe, and the boiling point of the gas mixture would matter. At very low temperatures even the O ring rubber type would matter as some types go less rubbery and do not seal properly. For instance, if the temperature of an upright butane canister drops below -0.5C/43F at sea level and one bar pressure, then the butane no longer boils/evaporates in the canister and the gas flow stops. There needs to be enough heat from a warmer place (air outside, ground or stove flame radiation) to supply energy to drive enough evaporation for cooking. Isopropane has a lower boiling point and propane a lower one yet; the temperature where a particular canister becomes impractical under normal use depends on the gas mixture. (Lower outside pressure will help a bit as the boiling point would be lower, but typically at such altitude the temperature is also lower!) A more robust winter gas canister stove solution would be one where a) The canister is turned upside down so the existing gas in the canister drives liquid fuel out of it, ie. you need very little heat directed to the canister. b) There is a heated supply pipe or heat shunt from the flame to where the fuel enters the burner, which ensures enough energy is supplied to evaporate the fuel before it reaches the burner head once the stove is started. The latter is an important safety consideration as liquid butane etc. reaching the burner would mean a lot of gas suddenly supplied to the burner as the flame evaporates it, ie. a flare-up. So upside down canisters are best used with stoves designed for that! Those features (which are unusual) should allow you to use a gas canister stove with a good mixture at -25C or a bit lower at sea level according to Backpacking Light (note only first page is subscription free). So it may be colder on the top of Everest, depending on the time, but would you be there in that case? :)
