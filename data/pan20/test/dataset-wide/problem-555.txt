I have figured out two options: The less elegant option is just putting some washers on the end of your axle, such that they lie between your locknut and the dropout when the wheel is installed. You have to fiddle with the washers every time you take off your wheel, but they will do the job. If you want to avoid that, you have to put them inside the locknut. If your wheel is such that the bottom of the locknut is outside of your cassette or freewheel - i.e. above your lockring, if you have a cassette - you can just put a washer between your locknut and cone. If the bottom of the locknut is not exposed, you may be able to still put in a washer, but it may block the splined locknut/freewheel remover. In that case, you have to use a part that is specially made for the task, usually called "axle spacers". You can find them on the internet by searching for "bicycle axle spacers", and they come in a bunch of sizes down to 0.5mm, so you should be able to find the perfect combination for your setup. You can put these between your locknut and your cone, and they will leave room for inserting the splined freewheel/lockring remover. 

In the UK the general idea is to not go mountain biking on the 'tourist' paths that walkers use. In most cases these paths, e.g. in Snowdonia, are not open to cyclists anyway. Obviously if you are on a path used by walkers then you go at a fairly pedestrian speed and give them lots of room. However, there are other trails that are not so popular with walkers and you kind of expect to have them to yourself. Negotiating the terrain without falling off is really the name of the game and 'oh there could be a walker ahead' is not really what you are thinking about. Equally they might not be expecting mountain bikes to be heading their way. So, even with the best of intentions, there are occasions when mountain bikers will set a bad example to others enjoying the great outdoors. 

Good question. Bottom bracket axles come in a variety of widths as do bottom bracket shells. Typically these measurements are marked on the axle or cartridge and you need these measurements to get a replacement. Needless to say you need to take a fair amount of parts off the bike to get to read the axle/cartridge, however that is the best way to get the required numbers. In the olden days when steel was king it normally came down to where the bike was from to get the bottom bracket width but a lot has changed since then and there are no convenient rules of thumb. That said, with a micrometer or even a ruler you can measure the bottom bracket shell width. In these simpler times a given bottom bracket shell size would come in up to three axle lengths for 1/2/3 chainrings - the longer axle needed for the 3 chainrings. You can work out what you need for a given bike thanks to the internet - Shimano provide their specifications online as do the less common brands. As for chainring spacing that does not really of concern here - your LBS got it slightly wrong but you can forgive them because you have to 'get a few wrong' before replacement bottom bracket axle/shell lengths are understood. 

For Shimano derailers, you may be able to find interchangeability information online on Shimano's website, but it's not easy to find. $URL$ has "exploded views" of their products which have a handy "interchangeability chart". These seem to be really badly edited though, as I have found quite a few where the interchangeability is mentioned for one derailer but not vice-versa. I think the best way to get a more exhaustive interchangeability list is to just google the "SHIMANO CODE NO." for the part you're looking for, which can be found on the chart in the exploded view of your product. This comes up with a nice list of all the other exploded view PDFs on Shimano's website that include the same part. You can than order the part that goes with any of the products in that list. This helped me find the exact same pulley wheel I was looking for, however there may be other sources for parts that will work just as well, though they may not be an exact match. 

I'm trying to adapt a 130mm over locknut distance (OLD) hub to a 135mm OLD frame. Sheldon Brown suggests that I can just add in spacers between the cones and the locknuts. Sheldon doesn't say, however, where I can find good spacers for this. Can I just go to a bike shop and buy some 2.5mm spacers? Do 2.5mm spacers even exist? Or do I have to jury rig it with washers from the hardware store? 

Cup and cone bearings on a bicycle need 'preload' for them to work properly under load. This is because the balls are tiny spheres of metal that deform under your weight. Hence the bearings must be tightened up slightly beyond feeling smooth when unloaded. Due to quality of parts, i.e. not perfect, a pre-loaded bearing feels 'rough' and requires effort to spin it. There are proper ways of applying the correct pre-load, e.g. with the use of a torque meter, however, 'feel' is a good way to do it. To understand that 'feel', go into a bike shop and try to turn the spindles on the new wheels that are for sale. With rare exceptions all of them will feel rough - this is preload. Now see how your own spindles/axles feel when you turn them without load, chances are that they feel pretty much the same. If you have rough bearings then you might think the grease is missing. Chances are that it is just the preload and not a grease problem at all. If you are going to dive in there anyway, do get a handle on the preload concept. As for your question on grease, a little grease goes a long way and you don't want it contaminated. The white lithium grease in a tube from your local bike shop will do fine. Yes you can buy posh coloured 'marine' grease but preload is what matters most with bearing setup. 

According to my copy of "A Guide to Cycling Injuries..." by Dr Domhnall MacAuley "Knee pain is almost an occupational hazard of cycling". So some knee pain is common. MacAuley does go on to say that, "For some, knee pain is inevitable". In the context of this question it seems like the rider has some tendency to knee pain but has not experienced chronic problems with a properly fitted bike so it should be possible to accommodate the change in pedal and return to comfortable rides. If it proves impossible to get the position (including saddle height) adjusted as per advice in the previous answer then it is possible that the change of pedal has restricted the freedom of movement of the foot causing stress on the knee, to continue from MacAuley: 

Some jobs require working with left-hand threads, for example, fitting cups to a BSA-threaded bottom bracket or fitting pedals. This is more likely a requirement for your medium duty, higher torque wrench. Some torque wrenches advertise 'reversible' ratchet heads but this is not the same thing. Unless it specifically says so, the wrench is unlikely to work on left-hand threads. 

In some bike shops there are bikes stored this way and very closely packed. In helping a customer choose a bike it can be necessary to lift bikes up and down onto wheel hooks with nothing scratched and no evidence of effort made (they don't want to buy a heavy bike). Space can also be limited so there is no way to have a 'run up'. There also might be a forest of bikes on the ground so you cannot move forward to support the weight of an bike 'at arms length'. I found the best way (UK instructions) is to: 

Rarely do you see people riding 'stock' BMX bikes - the bikes are as individual as the riders. Typically 'mummy' buys a 'stock' BMX and over time it gets more evolved, e.g. a frame with a longer top tube and fancy, bespoke parts. In the UK 'Mongoose' branded bikes are probably the best stocked and even then it is rare to find a bike shop with more than a few of the models, chosen to meet price points rather than due to the virtues of the bikes. Invariably you get tyres for the riding you describe with soft rubber rather than chunky tyres of a harder compound for the dirt track. Coming from a cycling background you might find it hard to be on a bike that has just the one fairly weak rear U-brake or sidepull (or no brakes at all). Therefore you may want to have a look at the almost-mainstream models that come with both brakes. These come with a 'rotor' in the headset so the bars can be turned 360. These bikes usually come with 'stump pegs' and typically weigh several metric tonnes. You can obviously take the 'stump pegs' off as well as the brake/rotor to get the weight down. Only the department store BMX bikes come with wheels that are less than robust. Most BMX come with 36 spoke wheels and that is a lot of spokes on a 20" wheel. The chainring size is something to look out for. Most of today's BMX bikes have a ridiculously small chainring. The sprocket is also absurdly small so the gearing is the same as normal. You save weight and have higher clearance with the small/small gearing. Stay away from older models with the big chainring. As for where you are now, you can go the traditional route of getting an available bike, such as a Mongoose freestyle model, to pimp it over time to suit your riding style. Alternatively you can buy a frame/bike of beauty such as a bike by 'We The People' and, even if you don't take up riding it too often, you will have a beautiful bike to look at. As with all things cycling it is the rider and not the bike. Some of those bikes that get thrown around in a gravity defying way by the experts are unbelievably heavy, probably heavier than a typical MTB or a fully equipped hybrid. Bear this in mind when you go to a LBS that stocks BMX or get something online.
