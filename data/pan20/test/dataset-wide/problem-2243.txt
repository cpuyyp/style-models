In aid climbing the frequency of difficult placements and the length of potential falls essentially determines the grade. Basically anything A2/C2 and up is going to require you to use some combination of hooks, cam hooks, bashies, and pins. These skills generally do not translate to trad climbing. If you are planning on climbing in a remote area or doing a first ascent being able to hammer a pin might be a useful skill. Being able to climb A4 and above means you will have to deal with long run outs (often for hours at a time). This may be a good way to increase your lead head, but as I have never lead at this level, I do not really know. Being able to climb A2 and hard routes, opens up the area of big wall climbing. While not all aid climbing is big wall climbing, almost all big wall climbing is aid climbing. The skills required to sleep on a ledge and haul loads do not generally translate to trad climbing. The gear and anchor management skills along with an increased tolerance for suffering do have some benefit for trad climbing. In my opinion, aid climbing is probably the best way to increase your tolerance for suffering. In terms of anchor management, there are enough differences between big wall anchors and trad anchors, that you are better off spending your time dealing with trad anchors. Every trad climber should be comfortable with climbing A0. The ability to pull on a piece to skip the crux, or a move that is giving you problems, on a long route can be critical. The question, at least in my mind, then becomes does learning how to climb C1 help you to be a better trad climber. There is no question that on a pitch of C1 you place a lot more gear, and are forced to deal with more tricky placements, than on a pitch of trad. That said, most people aid climb much slower such that the difference in total number of placements in a day between aid and trad climbing is not that massive. 

Required techniques vary from area to area and problem to problem, that said I think there are 3 techniques that are universal. This belief stems from my philosophy that the best thing about climbing hard is that there are more cool problems that you can climb. This is not to say there are not cool V2s (or even VBs, but a V5 climber has access to everything that a V4 climber has access to and more. My second belief is that climbers only break out the technique when they lack the power to climb it properly. The first is topping out. Unless you are really lucky, indoor bouldering does not generally require/enable/allow you to top out. You get to the last hold and drop down onto a bunch of cushy pads. Outdoors, you get to the last hold and now you got to figure out how to get over the lip. In generally, involves a mantle of some sort and your feet really high. You blow the top out and it is likely you are coming off head over heels. The second is power. At the V2/V3 grade, there are not many problems that stronger climbers cannot do while wearing approach shoes without jamming, heel hooking or any other technique like trickery. Enough power will get you through almost any V3 (and a lot more). Sure, really good technique applied to the appropriate problem will get you to the top, but if you can only choose one tool for your arsenal, power is not a bad one to choose. The third is enough open hand strength to allow you to deliver your power to the rock. Sure some holds are better crimped and others should be jammed, but again, if you can slap a hold and have your hand stick to it, that should get you through most V3s. As for route finding/reading, at the V2 level, in all but the most isolated areas you will have plenty of access to beta. Even in the absence of beta (and chalk), if you have enough power, it doesn't matter if you miss a key foot hold or your hands are backwards. As for differences in indoor and outdoor grading, this often depends on the area. Indoor bouldering at the V2/V3 level is often on steep terrain with either big jugs far apart or moderate holds close together. Outdoor V2/V3 is often less or near vertical. This means that power that you develop in the gym is less useful outside, but as your indoor power grows and you start to climb steeper problems outside, that gap will close. 

I almost pointed out in my comment that these make me think you want to know if something happened to me, if someone would come looking right away. Telling a creepy stranger that you are not from around here and haven't checked in 3 days, is not really a good idea. The questions are not really out of place, but under certain circumstances they might make an individual a little more on edge. This is especially true if you look homeless and have two large scary dogs. More importantly, most hikers are all to happy to tell you where they have been and are going. There typically is no reason to even have to ask; if you strike up a conversation, they will probably tell you. 

Most campground in Maryland State parks are not dispersed. The exception is Green Ridge State Forest 

A number of videos and blogs suggest that the Munter should be tied with the load strand close to the gate and the break position down towards the hip. They even use an autoblock to back it up and force the downwards break position. (I am not providing links on the off chance I am correct and the information is bad). Have there been new developments regarding the use of a Munter hitch for belaying and rappelling? 

While most people think that the YDS system is easy compared to the British rating system, I am not sure that is the case. In the YDS system, there is a rating, a grade, and a class. The grade indicates the length of time the route typically requires ranging from I (the route takes a few hours) to VII (route takes a week or longer). The rating refers to the quality of the protection and follows a pattern based on the Motion Picture Association of America. Within the YDS system a rating of G means solid protection and X means no protection. The rating is typically only applied to 5th class climbing (see below). The class refers to technical difficulty and ranges from 1 (walking) to 6 (aid climbing). Fifth class, technical roped climbing, is the most commonly discussed and is subdivided from 5.0 (easy roped climbing) to 5.15 (really hard). Some of these subclasses are further subdivided into a, b, c, and d. Sixth class climbing is also subdivided. Historically, aid climbs were given a prefix of A and a numeric classifiers regarding difficulty with A0 being the easiest and A5 being the hardest. An A5 climb generally does not involve any "free climbing" (i.e., typical rock climbing where you are protected by a rope) and involves continuous stretches of aid climbing on body weight only placements (e.g., hooks, cam hooks, micro nuts, and bashies). An A1 climb involves continuous stretches of aid climbing but the placements can hold a fall (e.g., cams, nuts, and pitons). An A0 climb would involve continuous stretches of free climbing with the occasional aid climbing move. A classic A0 route is the Royal Arches route (5.6 PG A0 II). The majority of the route is moderately difficult free/rock climbing between adequate protection and takes 1/2 a day. It gets the A0 classification because there is a difficult (5.10b) traverse in the middle. This traverse can be bypassed by a pendulum off of fixed gear. Other A0 "routes" are free climbs that are too difficult for the climber and they pull on a piece of gear to bypass the crux. In the early days of aid climbing, difficult stretches where protected by pitons, rivets, and bolts and a hammer (and drill) where key pieces of equipment. There has been a movement to do routes "clean" such that no trace is left behind (including scares to the rock). This lead to an additional prefix of C to denote aid climbs that could be done without a hammer (the ethics are a little more complicated). So for aid climbing you can have A0-A5 or C0-C5 depending on the difficulty and if you need a hammer/drill. To give an example, most people rate The Nose as 5.8 C2 VI despite the fact that some people can climb it in a morning and others can free climb it (and Caldwell can do both). This rating means that it requires some moderate free climbing (5.8), can be climbed without a hammer but has some body weight only placements (C2) and takes multiple days (but less than a week) to complete. 

There seems to be conflicting information on the web about how to use a Munter hitch for belaying and rappelling while rock climbing. The way I learned decades ago is consistent with Nols Wilderness Mountaineering by Phil Powers: 

One issue with Method 1 is that after C3 finishes jugging on R2, C2 needs to be able to pull R2 back to the anchor and attach the pig. If the lower end of R2 is attached to the anchor, then it may become difficult for C3 to tie in short as they are jugging since the rope could become taught. A way around this is to either attach the pendulum rope R3 to R2 to allow C2 to retrieve the lower end of R2. A slightly different system would be for C3 to drag a second haul line R4 as they are jugging. One issue with Method 2 is there is a lot going on (two people jugging and one person hauling). It might be better if C2 lowers C3 and the pig out immediately and both C2 and C3 start jugging, but C1 does not immediately start hauling the pig. Then when C3 gets to the belay, they can start leading the next pitch immediately. When C2 finishes cleaning, they can then start hauling (sucks to be C2). This not only gets the next pitch started sooner, but also means only two things are moving at once (two people jugging, leader and cleaner, or leader and pig). 

Despite not being a knot, I think a bale sling meets your requirements. There is little resistance on the hitch meaning it will cinch tight pretty easily and it is difficult to release while loaded. You also might want to look at a barrel hitch (again not a knot). It doesn't cinch tight in the same way and one can remove the object easily even when under load, but the design of the hitch is such that the object is unlikely to simply fall out. 

From what I can piece together, according to the The Gunks Guide by Swain the protection rating system was proposed in Rocky Heights, A Guide to Boulder Free Climbs by Erickson. According to Swain the ratings are: 

Basically this is almost the textbook worst case scenario lacking only on not being hurt, completely alone in the dark and bad weather. To summarize the situation you have a piece of rated webbing you are using as a harness, a single locking carabiner and the rope. The rope is running through a rap ring of unknown strength. While you could try and adjust the lengths of the ropes, the problem is that they need to be unweighted to do it safely because many rap rings can wear through if a weighted rope is pulled through them. Things are even worse since you are using a Munter because if you hold one strand fixed and allow the long strand to move this can saw through the rope. You could attempt to have the strands move at different rates, but this would still cause the weighted rope to run through the rap ring. If you wait until you are very close to the end of the rope, then if you do saw through the rope or rap ring, the fall will not be very far (and you may even make it to the ground). If you do this, make sure you hike back to the top and replace the potentially compromised rap ring. Depending on the exact heights, you might be able to safely rap off the end of the ropes. If the end of the rope is only 10 feet up, your feet will only be 7 feet above the ground when you get to the end of the rope. Hopefully with the additional rope stretch you would make it (or at least be close enough to not get injured in the drop). Being bare foot adds to the risk. The best option is to go up and not down. You can ask the person on the ground to tie some extra gear onto the long end of the rope (a couple of slings and carabiners is all you need). That said, you have enough gear to rescue yourself since you are using a swiss seat harness made from webbing (if you were in a modern harness and alone, I think you are screwed). The key is to use the webbing from your harness to create a klemheist and the carabiner from the Munter to ascend the rope. Of course you have to first free up the webbing. To get the webbing, you need to create a second swiss seat harness from the running end of the rope. Then use some extra rope to saw through the webbing harness (bet you wish you had a small knife). Depending on how tight the second swiss seat is, you will fall a little. All of these steps could be eliminated if you had a piece of webbing or cord (maybe from your chalk bag). Once you have the webbing make a klemheist and a foot loop (if needed, use some more rope). Push the klemheist high, step up, clip in with the carabiner, sit down, repeat. You should tie in short frequently since otherwise when you open the carabiner to reclip in, you will be out of the system (a second carabiner would be super helpful here).
