It was mainly a "Phoney War." But early in September, the French advanced a few miles into the industrialized Saar region (as they did in 1923). They stopped as soon as they encountered their first real resistance in the form of German soldiers protected by mine fields, even though the 40 available French divisions outnumbered the German defenders by about 2 to 1. A few days later, the French high command decided to withdraw, and fight a World War I-style defensive war. This decision was buttressed by the rapid fall of Poland, and the fact that it would have been too late for the French army to make its weight felt before the Germans were returned from the Polish front. 

Your hypothetical is what Thomas Malthus warned against in 1798. He believed that technical progress would continue in a straight line, while population would grow faster. That is in fact, what happened in China. But the western world escaped the Malthusian trap by generating exponential growth that beat the population growth. 

Germany sent, or tried to send the "Zimmerman telegram" to a Mexican government that basically didn't exist. Americans initially thought it was a "ruse" by the Allies until Germany's Arthur Zimmerman admitted to sending the telegram, as pointed out by one of the posters. The reason was that Mexico was in throes of a "free for all" civil war at the time, which is to say that it was in a state of anarchy. The reason the Germans thought otherwise was because the most unruly of the four major factions, the one under Pancho Villa, "invaded" the United States, crossing the Rio Grande to escape from the others. The Germans reasoned that the Mexicans were trying to recapture Texas and New Mexico, so they offered "Mexico" Arizona and California as well, all of which Mexico had lost to the United States in the 1830s and 1840s. America's General John J. "Blackjack" Pershing soon launched a counterattack that pushed Pancho Villa back into Mexico. Then he led American forces that ultimately won the First World War from Germany. 

The closer to the end of World War II, the better the chances of survival. Basically, it was a matter of "running out the clock." First, the closer to the end of the war, the fewer days (and chances) for someone to be "caught." In this regard, geography played a role. People in many parts of France and Poland were "safe" after August 1944 because of Allied liberation. Those in Germany needed to hold out until spring, 1945. Second, many people survived for some days or months after being caught and sent to a camp (if not immediately exterminated on arrival). Anne Frank was caught in August, 1944 and died in February-March 1945. Move the timeline three months to November, and she might have survived. Finally, as others have pointed out, the closer to the end of the war, the lesser chance of denunciation and arrest. When the Nazis started losing, people wanted to avoid being on the losing side (all other things being equal). And toward the end of the war, the military and police were more concerned about defending the "homeland" from invasion than rounding up Jews. 

At least one modern authority, historian Alison Weir, believes that Catherine Howard used birth control (her book, King Henry VIII, p. 446). What form that might be is hard to say, probably some "barrier" method such as a crude diaphragm, or maybe IUD. This would be during her "relationship" with Francis Derehem, which she did not consider a "real" relationship, and therefore did not want to have his children. She declined to say that she was "precontracted" to marry him, even though that would have allowed Henry VIII to annul their marriage, and quite possibly saved her life. She apparently stopped using birth control after her marriage to Henry VIII. He was an old man by that time, and engaged in few relations (at least with Catherine). She perhaps "refrained" from actual sex with Culpeper, although both of them confessed to "wanting" to have sex with the other (according to Weir). Which was "enough" of a crime by itself, to convict both of them. 

Boiling oil is a good weapon, because its boiling point (400 degrees Fahrenheit) is much higher than that of water (212 degrees). It was a moderately effective weapon against men. But by its boiling and burning properties, it was a very effective weapon against ladders, rams, catapults, and other war instruments made of wood. Also, if successfully used, it would cause a horrible death by burning. As such, killing ten enemy soldiers with oil had more of a "deterrent" effect than killing the same number by sword. Because it was expensive, a garrison would not base its plans on using oil. But they used oil for other things like cooking, which is to say, that it could also be used to "cook" their enemies. When one is under attack, one uses what weapons one has at hand and worries about the consequences later. An attack on the citadel was basically the last day of the battle. Either the defenders would win, in which case they could exit the place and replenish their supplies of oil, or they would lose, in which case they'd be slaughtered. Either way, saving oil for "after the battle" didn't make sense. 

There were a few successful instances of mercantilism by countries that started behind others, and needed to "catch up." These include Russia under Peter the Great in the 18th century, and later, under Count Witte early in the 20th century. Another example was Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, and again, right after World War II. China may be today's example (although the jury is still out on this one). Such policies typically hurt the most ADVANCED countries such as Britain in the 19th century or the United States in the 20th. Being the most developed, they would logically benefit the most from free trade, and suffer the most from anything that distorts trade. But it's the "second tier" countries that benefit the most from mercantilism, because it could well be that what it gains from modernizing a backward sector more than offsets the losses suffered by the rest of the country. 

Cecil Rhodes, the founder of South Africa's DeBeers Diamond Company, and the British South Africa Company maintained an "army" of 600 cavalry under Dr. Leland Starr Jameson that helped bring about the Boer War. 

Anne Frank's story was "uncommon." It's true that she died like many others, but in other ways her story was exceptional. 1) She lived in the Netherlands, a country where urban Jews were not rounded up in ghettoes (as they were in Poland). She also came from a relatively wealthy family who could pay for their hiding, and lived in a country that was less anti-Semitic than some others. These factors made her discovery (summer of 1944) later than others' (early 1940s), and the term of her imprisonment shorter. 2) She died in February-March, 1945. That's a tragedy of course, but she lived closer to liberation day than most. A rescue date three months earlier, and she probably would have survived. 3) Most important, her diary lived on, even though she did not. Many others kept diaries, but few, if any, of them were as famous as hers. 

As I understand it, there were two types of sieges. One was where the attacking army would "camp," surrounding the city, and let the defenders run out of food. An example was Ulysses S. Grant's siege of Vicksburg. The other kind was where the attacking army would try to invade the city by breaching the walls, scaling them, or by tunneling under them (e.g. Grant's forces at St. Petersburg, Virginia, or Santa Anna at the Alamo). What considerations would cause an attacking army to choose one kind of siege over the other? Was one easier to defend against than the other? 

I wouldn't characterize "interwar" proposals by Britain as efforts to get India an East African colony, because there was no India. A different and better way to put it was that Britain wanted to do something for Indians in East Africa. That's partly because Indians had helped Britain a lot in that part of the world. For instance, Indians helped build the cross-Kenya railroad that connected the mineral and agricultural resources of the highlands to the sea. And in the fight for German-held Tanganyika, Indian troops, and Indian logistics (porters, ox-carts, etc.) had played a key role in the final British success. Another reason was that there were two Indian enclaves in eastern Africa that the British couldn't control directly. One was in the island of Mauritius, technically under French rule, but with a population that was more than half Indian. The other was in Natal, South Africa, where the Indians were a plurality, but where competing Boer and Zulu claims prevented the British from giving the Indians an area all to themselves. A logical place for Britain to set up an Indian enclave under its direct control would be the islands of "Zanzibar," or possibly a piece of the Tanganyikan mainland. Unless they could work a deal with the French to exchange a piece of e.g. Tanganyika for Mauritius. Nograpes' excellent sources confirm what I had long suspected: That Britain wanted to do "something" for some Indians between World War I and World War II. This might not take the form of an Indian "colony" per se, but rather a "subcolony," where Indians would be under Britain, but above everyone else in "their" colony. Then, such a subcolony in Africa might later become part of an independent India, depending on how the independence movement in India, and Britain's decolonization played out.
