There is a contradiction if the distinction isn't made between the death penalty as a form of punishment or as a necessary means of protecting society. The former, is indefensible if juxtaposed with the belief in a right to life and the latter, in any society capable of producing prisons keeping inmates in near complete isolation, is nearly never the case. The reason killing as a form of punishment is not justified by one who adopts the 'right to life' philosophy is that it doesn't protect any other peoples lives. The personalistic norm of John Paul II says a person is an entity towards which the only proper way to relate is love. The notion of 'doing unto others as they would do unto you' could be used to justify the death penalty is thrown out the door when you consider the personalistic norm, as do many prolifers. The personalistic norm doesn't mean surrender yourself or your family to invaders who want to kill you, when any notion of 'proper relations' has gone out the door. The reason killing as a form of punishment is accepted as a plank of the Republican Party is that it is a tough way to deal with crime. That's not very philosophical or wise. People often conflate these two very different ideas, but I'd like to hope we're moving away from the death penalty (and life sentences) altogether. 

p 219 (the answer key) states the answer as (a), but why is (b) incorrect? p 114 summarises Spinoza's view that God's infinity implies that God is everything. But how can God be infinite (in his omnibenevolence, omnipotence, omniscience) if God is not perfect? 

I understand the first paragraph (on the general distinction between FC and HG), but I do not comprehend how 2 is a class statement. To me, 2 can be equally interpreted correctly as 3 below. I accept that 2 is likelier than 3, because 2 asserts a decrease in the mean average of fuel consumption, whereas 3 asserts a decrease in each vehicle's fuel consumption but 3 is certainly possible (For example, if suddenly a law were enacted that allowed only electric cars).

If the war is declared by a legitimate authority, then it ought to have the backing of those who wish to give up their civil liberties - if only in a representative way. If the ends are proportional to the means, then it would have to be worse for the citizenry to not give up their civil liberties than to do so. In another sense, all the principles for just war theory must be found true just for the war to be declared, so they all come in to play and they are all very hard to satisfy. 

Article 1 is St. Thomas Aquinas's argument for denying the premise I was looking for some clues for other reasons, and I think a weakness would be found in article 2 where it seems that the ontological proof is unnecessary if you can see God's effects. One might ask the question, "Why would a God who manifests Himself in human history need to be merely self-evident?" Because merely asking this might beg the question of whether or not "We need God" or "God needs us" because it would seem to imply that God needs to manifest himself. St. Thomas also states that we can't have total knowledge of God, by his effects, so it is irrelevant to say God needs us since we can't fully know Him. If you can see my toe, then you can infer that I exist whether or not my toe is still attached in any meaningful way to my body. 

I do not see any impact of Goedel's result to epistemology. Broadly speaking, epistemology deals with the question how we recognize objects and facts from reality. It refers to the relation (issue 1) between the world (issue 2) and our model (issue 3) of the world. Goedel's result refers to the power of axiomatized theories. This issue neither refers to the world (issue 2) nor to the relation (issue 1) between world and model. At most, it refers to properties of our world models (issue 3). 

1) Your question concerning the value of life has been answered differently. The answer depends on the worldview of the person who gives the answer. E.g., according to the Jewish and the Christian religion life and human life in particular has a high value in itself (intrinsic value). On the other end of the spectrum we have people who emphasize just the opposite assessment: Life has no value in itself. As a consequence it is up to each person to determine the length of his life and in particular to end his own life by suicide. 2) You also ask about the meaning of life. Also this question has been answered differently. In most cases an atheist will deny that life has a meaning by itself. Instead it is the task of each individual to give an individual meaning to his own life. While based on a religious worldview the meaning of human life could be worshipping a deity or qualifying for a pleasant afterlife. Note. The two concepts meaning of life and value of life are related but not identical. 

I understand that sufferers liable for the suffering should blame themselves: eg, a gastronome may genuinely suffer if his $3000 USD/kg edible bird's nests are roasted instead of poached; but unsympathetic and in respect of the starving, most people would blame the gastronome for his overindulgence. But blaming a suffering innocent appears unethical: eg, while a permanent sufferer of a freak accident should try to cheer up, the blame should be on the the freak accident, and NOT on the sufferer's inability to cheer up. 

But how do 2 and 3 apply to soldiers? Even after receiving orders, low-ranking commissioned (e.g. 1st or 2nd Lieutenants) and non-commissioned officers (e.g. Sergeants) must still think and reason for themselves? 

In [1.], Socrates says that you can't seek what you don't know, because you don't know what to seek. Yet in [2], he does believe in seeking what you don't know. So do [1] and [2] conflict?
