In each case the outcome is different, and the classes arise again in a different form on a slightly different basis. For instance, European Feudalism ruined both classes -- when local peace held for too long and war became more commonly national in scale, the truly feudal Lords eventually ended up landed but penniless and the truly feudal serfs wound up without any source of protection. So both were either driven into towns, with that new set of classes (bourgeoisie and proletariat), or folded up into the wider holdings of the mercantile era nobility, with that new set of classes (state taxpayers and tenant farmers). There was no revolution because both other options already existed -- the upper nobility was already mercantile and statist and the town system had always existed to deliver goods. But two things that had been minor contributors came to center stage -- Nations and Cities. That is the synthesis part: new options become visible through the pressures of incipient failure, to either solve the same problem more broadly or to mine a new vein of temporary options until a broader solution takes hold. As I see it, it parallels the development of industrial power. We try out each different potential basis and reason for the class division, using up or outgrowing the 'fossil fuel' implicit in that mode of contrast and its associated virtues and moving on to the next form of what we currently model as social capital (but only because we are capitalists), until we find a social organization with a renewable form of 'social energy', or we run out of options and simply succumb to directionless and chaos. 

Nor is there any logic behind the notion that without a definition of necessity, everything is necessary. It is like saying without a definition of blue, everything is blue. Anything might be necessary or it might not be. By 'just giving' we accept reality and do not pretend it has to be shaped by some particular force which we can call 'necessity'. Which is what we intended to do. 

Basically backing up @BrianZ, but there is a simpler way to put it. Marx did not live in a time where there was today's bizarre, excessive capacity for rapid production. Had he seen more modern economies, he would clearly have noted that things do not have value for which there is no market. He could overlook this and think he had explained it away, because Victorian leverage was nothing like modern leverage. Half of modern economies' success relies upon creating demand. If the labor is invested in something for which the demand cannot be created, the value is lost, however much there was of it. And it cannot be recovered. So this loss is not a matter of exchange-rate, which is Marx's answer to this objection in his own time. And even if the demand exists only at the whim of the entitled, it creates demand upon others, and gives use to things that would otherwise not have value. Again, this is not merely a difference in exchange rate. In any era, but especially since birth-control, intelligent poor people do or do not have children according whether industry seems ready to support them. This is real labor (and thus by Marx, value) that does or does not exist according to the market in a very literal way. At the other extreme, if value somehow inheres in every product, then insane manifestos and elaborate works of art no one understands or cares for, somehow improve the world for the next generation. They capture the resources of an entire lifetime, often the time of someone supported by layers of lower-class workers or educated at great cost by big names, and entertained with complex pharmaceuticals and other highly intensive cultural artifacts. This adds up fast. But they are not implicitly valuable in any way. We know better. What they do instead, is keep those supporting structures employed and the rest of us distracted. (This reminds me of a punny business mantra -- it isn't a sum, it is a product. The labor theory of value tries to reflect creative and intellectual input as additions to production labor, but in fact they are both leverage upon it. The formula is less "value = work + management + positioning", which Marx would require, and more "value = work * management * positioning". In particular, zero in any factor nets you zero.) 

Engels clearly sees the gender divide as the first class divide and the prototype for all later classism. This is where we get Marxist-feminism originally. From an earlier analysis of Celtic culture, he saw the initial ownership of land as having been restricted to women. As a continuation of hunter-gathering culture, after agriculture, men owned cattle, which needed to continually move, so as not to overgraze land, and women owned houses, which controlled access to safe fields. As agriculture intensified, it was more necessary to hold land, and it was held by women. The original Welsh tradition of passing land titles to sisters'-son's (maternal nephews), and not biological heirs, is the oldest recorded form of male-to-male inheritance. So women were the holders of lineage, and the ruling class. Then, as war became a larger and larger scale of endeavor, men formed a sort of protection racket that eroded women's hold on land, in what then becomes the prototype of the first economic revolution. (Sources "We are All Part of One Another" by Barbra Deming, and "Truth or Dare" by Starhawk.) I don't agree, or at least, if there is such a divide it has more than two classes. A more basic arrangement of human culture from a more modern perspective is the sort of polygynous collective agriculture still practiced in parts of Africa. In such an arrangement, men who hold land have multiple wives, and the remaining majority of men and minority of women are consigned to the role of workers on other's land. This is supported by evidence that several times more neolithic women than men have descendents. $URL$ It is a majority of men and a minority of women because if married men all take two or three wives, then there are between equally many and twice as many men who never get married, while almost all women will become wives. If married men do not take two or three wives in this model, they cannot feed their cattle in hostile seasons, because there is a hard division of labor: men do not farm, they only clear land and manage animals. Tropical land where we originated in Africa is often single-use, once you grow on it one season, you have to let it grow over before it will bear decently again. So clearing land is a constant occupation that used up the labor of all those unmarried men. In such a system, one cannot make the argument that men as a whole or women as a whole are the more powerful economic class, since the majority of men hold nothing, and the majority of women jointly hold land, even if they cannot hold land in their own right. Men in such societies also do not hold land until married. The inheritor is the son first chosen by a woman's family for an arranged marriage. Eventually two things happened to break this down. We developed a more plant-based diet, so the women's work became much more important than the men's, and the men started doing it with them. And we learned that we can improve soil by putting waste back into it, so land recovers fast enough that it does not have to be cleared of trees each time. I don't imagine it took too much pressure to break down universal polygyny once that was possible -- humans do not seem predisposed to sharing mates well. From such a direction, you can only see this as a class system if you see it as a three-tiered one where women form the middle class and men form both the upper and the lower class. But that keeps gender itself from being a class divide per se. To my mind, this accords better with reality than the Marxist-Feminist notion that since that first deposition from power women have always been the losers. In modern society we have difficulty with women leading, but 90% of the people we kill, lock up or just let die are male. The fate of women is thus intermediate between the fates of these two classes of men. 

Flat space is only one among a number of different kinds of spaces. We live on a sphere, so, in fact, none of the circles we actually see on the globe have pi as the ratio of their circumference to their diameter. Circles on a sphere do not have this as a fixed ratio. But we have the mental image of a flat space, where pi is well defined by this relation. How arbitrary was that choice? If it is to some degree arbitrary, why should any particular part of its structure be less so? For instance, the length of a diagonal in flat space is just as irrational and no more regular than pi. 

The classical Intuitionist approach to this is to admit that infinities are just a figure of speech making it easier to discuss ongoing processes that can be repeated. There are an 'infinity' of points in a line because I can keep dividing it arbitrarily often. From that point of view, 'completed' infinities simply don't exist. But then again, neither do sets. There is not some kind of cosmic baggie that springs into existence to separate the things you decide are in a set from the things that aren't. Both are verbal shorthand for common ways of looking at things. So why not roll up the one verbal shorthand within the other? From this point of view, the axiom of infinity says, 'Yes we are going to include the human intuition of repetition in the notion of listing.' As long as you don't get carried away and forget these are abstractions of potentialities, rather than instantiated objects, no harm is done. Sets of 'real' numbers of arbitrary precision are even reasonable, as you can picture a real number as an endless binary fraction, a procedure where we divided a length and chose either the left or the right half over and over. And we can imagine any number of these ongoing selection processes continuing in parallel. But there are points where it is obvious that you have taken this convenience too far. For instance, the paradoxes like Tarski's, introduced by applying the Axiom of Choice to neighborhoods in the real plane should not sneak into your reasoning due to a mere convenience. They rely on tricks that defy our natural notion of infinity as incomplete progress. The axiom of choice simply cannot apply in this case. There is no reasonable way to imagine a selection process that has something going on for each real number in a range. There is no such thing as each real number in a range. To collect them up and separate them all, the infinite sequences of digits would have to be completed, so we could sort through them. As long as they are mere potentialities modeled by processes ticking out boolean decisions sequentially you cannot tell apart the ones that are running at similar 'speeds' and converging to similar places. So strangely, we have a sort of linguistic gap, here we can talk about 'all' real numbers in a range, but not about 'each' one doing something. So there is a reasonable defense for the Axiom of Infinity, as it captures the intuition of arbitrary repetition. But there is still a limit beyond which one must be careful about simply naming a set and pretending that the thing named is really something a human can actually find or imagine. A lot of cardinal and ordinal theory betrays the original understanding with linguistic tricks that create masses of references to indiscernible objects. 

We regularly find the mentally disabled innocent on the basis of limited understanding. So the distinction is already part of the adult justice system. I think the distinction between the two separate sentencing systems is really not about the defendant's developmental level but rather how much we expect the person to develop beyond their current moral status. An adult might be found innocent based on mental age, but would still not be tried as a juvenile on that basis, because juvenile facilities and procedures are meant to accommodate the child's ongoing development and to really educate, in the sense of 'shaping personality' rather than just to rehabilitate. The adult is not expected to be subject to the same kind of shaping. Of course, to some degree this is provably incorrect, people do continue to develop, and prisoners can find something in the experience that is less of a rehabilitation of their viewpoint and more of a new dimension of their personality. (Tim Robbins' drama projects, for instance, seem to work in this way -- by giving the participants a different kind of theory of mind and empathy than they developed the first time around through having them play roles for extended periods.) But it is not the expected response of an adult to punishment. To try a child as an adult, you basically have to make the case they will not grow out of their criminal mindset. This can be because the crime indicates psychopathology that does not tend to be treatable, or because the child has so little time left before growth is complete that they are unlikely to come that far by then. So folks that usually get charged as adults are at least 16. My guess is that this case must fall in the first category, or no one would dare charge someone so young as an adult. Something in the child's method must indicate he is depraved, and not just impulsive. 

You don't mean the idea of free will, you mean the value of autonomy. Clearly the only reason to legislate anything is to limit the expression of free will. If we did not believe in free will, we would pursue something like $URL$ stop trying to control behavior and just try to predict it and shape it via technology instead. So, their existence presumes free will, and does not contradict it. Autonomy has been put forward as a basic principle of ethics by many, including Kant. But such ideas generally aim to universalize autonomy or spread it to as many individuals as possible. Very few cogently argue for simply increasing the autonomy of the majority even if this severely limits everyone else. Extreme libertarians do, but they can do so only by presuming that liberty and property are the only rights that really matter. (I would argue that by not at least covering the traditional range of Cardinal Virtues, i.e. not including safety and reciprocity as concerns, this is itself a position that reflects a certain level of privilege, and should be distrusted.) Defending your choice to act upon chosen biases does not increase the general level of autonomy across the board, if at all. First of all, the bias itself is not generally a choice, it is a traditional dictate, and so it does not really reflect autonomy. To be free to question it increases one's autonomy. Having counterexamples visible to you opens to you the opportunity to question the bias. If those counterexamples do not arise from simply refusing to allow baseless application of the bias in place of logic and fairness, then the bias will be proven to have a point, we will figure out how to accommodate the facts of life, and the resistance will go away. (We don't, for instance, insist that one hire children on par with adults, or make onerous adaptations for someone like a blind graphic artist. We only truly challenge traditional biases that seem to have no realistic basis.) Second, strong enough biases severely limit the autonomy of certain individuals while reversing them limits the autonomy of a wider range of people, but only mildly. Let me offer an example now in our past: In highly religious areas of the U.S., it used to be traditional to shun the divorced. My grandmother, who had been a schoolteacher, therefore, lost her occupation, in addition to her husband, when he left her. She and her children suffered considerably until she could earn the money (as a house servant -- one of the few jobs she was any good at that did not force people to interact with her 'morally') to move to a more populous, less religious, region of the country, where she could return to teaching. On the other hand, just insisting parents should trust her to continue doing the job she had always successfully held might have required they explain some difficult facts to their children, but would not have harmed anyone severely. Several decades later, teachers' unions negotiated laws that prevented immediately firing divorcees from educational settings. When you balance it all out, it is highly ambiguous whether the overall level of autonomy has been raised or lowered by instituting such a rule. Teachers are now free to conduct their marital lives the same way everyone else can, but people can no longer protect their children from others who think it is OK to get divorced under some circumstances (like long-term abandonment.) So, if you want to argue against anti-discrimination laws from the value of autonomy, it can be done only by taking the strange libertarian perspective of those whose main problem in life is being told what to do, over the perspective of people who are marginalized into poverty or death by the refusal to consider them potentially equal. If you attempt to consider all perspectives equally and to consider more severe losses more highly than minor limitations, you ultimately find the patterns of discrimination around us are reducing the overall balance of autonomy, which makes them immoral according to the most commonly expressed ethical formulations, which are often a balance of Kantian fairness and Utilitarian perspectives.
