You definitely can use an XC bike for road-biking purposes especially if you swap the stock XC knobby tires with slicks meant for the road. The only area you might be at a disadvantage as Glenn has already pointed out is you might run out of gears if the group you are riding with hits speeds in excess of 60 kph which can happen on downhills. 

A cyclocross bike which can accomodate fenders and a rack could be an option. I personally use an aluminum framed Cannondale CAADX Tiagra on my 17 mile (one way) commute and I like its versatility. It is relatively light (21 lbs) and has eyelets to accommodate fenders and a rack. It can also be fitted with a variety of tires ranging from slicks to studded. The XC frame makes the bike more maneuverable (can be useful in negotiating traffic) than a touring bicycle. Pic of the commuter below: I use this bike 2 or 3 times a week to commute downtown. It is almost as fast as my road bike on uneven roads. The wider tires (that can run at lower pressure) can soak up bumps better. 

There will definitely be some geometry differences compared to what the manufacturer made the frame you will choose for. Unless of course you want to make an enduro bike with 180mm front suspension, so its not enduro anymore! If I wanted to build something nice and strong from the beginning, I would start with an enduro frame. Both frame options can get any peripherials we want - fine! As far as suspensios are concerned though, we need to bee ccautious, cause their size affects geometry. Bigger suspensions up to 20mm are acceptable to most frames and geometries. I wouldn't personally risk go lower though. DH bikes are made for 180-200mm and putting a 160mm enduro fork would mean bad behaviour from the frame and the fork in trails, bacuse geometry is ruined. But an enduro frame upgraded from 160 to 180mm is not that terrible. Actually is not terrible at all, its awesome and its predictable both by manufacturers and riders! 

I've just had my 4th puncture in 8 days on the bike I use to commute to work. Same back wheel each time. I haven't had a puncture before in the 2 years I've had this bike. After the first puncture I replaced the tube. After the second puncture I repaired the tube. After the third puncture I replaced the tube and got a new tire. Two days later it's punctured again. What's strange is that the punctures - tiny, like a thin needle - have all been on the part of the tube facing the tire. They have all been randomly spread around the tube with respect to the valve. Both these seem to indicate it has nothing to do with the rim, and yet with a new tire it's still punctured...? Any thoughts? (I'm considering the possibility that someone is sabataging my bike while it's parked in my university parking, though there is evidence against this also.) 

Before outnumbering some key points I usually look when I want to buy a bike, I will tell you this: Ride them both. Form an opinion for each one and buy the one you think that comes better to you. 

These are protective stickers for the chainstay, bottom end and some spots on your frame where the brake and speed cables cause frictions with the frame, scratching the colour. 

Bottom bracket and the inside of the frame might get oxidised (rusty). Cover the hole with a plastic bag or something else, to prevent rain from going inside your frame. 

Gloves are pretty handy. First of all, they offer better grip with the handlebar, without causing skin loosening or similar symptoms. Secondly, they help avoid scratches and injuries in case of fall or passing through trails with thick bushes (mtb). They are also a good piece of fabric to absorb sweat and clean your googles. Last, but not least, they might be great when theres cold/wind/rain. 

In the winter when the garden hose is disconnected I use a watering can filled with warm water to wash the dirt/salt off the bike before taking it in. I use mild detergent soap to speed up the removal of oil and grease then pour the warm water from the can to remove the soap. 

I have a similar tights from MEC which I mostly use for commuting and also a thinner MEC spandex tights which I pair with a Patagonia polypro inner layer which I wear when riding the road bike (group or solo). In both cases, I wear spandex shorts outside the tights. The shorts I use in such cases are those with the thinnest chammy. Why do I wear the shorts outside? Mainly because it protects the tights from chaffing/runs. I noticed the material used for the tights are not as robust as those of the cycling shorts. When temps go north of 0 C, I stop using tights altogether and start using leg warmers... much easier to get into. 

Compare their peripherials (suspension, drivetrain, brakes etc). Check what their manufacturer made them for and the warranty provided. If you have two bikes having drivetrain from the same manufacturer, it is wise you choose the one that might have a better series on (why get sram x9 if you can have xx for example). What is the frame warranty from the manufacturer? Make sure you know what are you spending your money to. Both bikes you are looking at are expensive xc bikes with some top peripherials. What discipline do you really want to ride? Do you need something that expensive? Are you a competitor, or just a fan of mtb? What is your experience level? Beginner or pro? Spending a huge amount of money on a bike as a beginner is wrong. Learning and evolving on a reliable, yet not top of the class bike, will make you a better rider. 

The answer to my question -- why did my bike puncture four times, even after replacing the tube and tire -- turned out to be: bad luck. The first three punctures were caused by some damage in the tire (the punctures on the tube were all on the tire side). After I replaced the tire, I got another puncture - but this time the puncture was on the part of the tube facing the rim. On inspection I was that my rim tape was protruding up at the point of the puncture. Because I had a new tire and tube I had pumped the wheel up more than usual, which perhaps meant that rim tape protrusion was now a problem. So, four punctures in one week: three from the tire, one from the rim. For anyone else experiencing a confusing series of punctures, consider that you may be unlucky and that there are multiple problems in your wheel! 

First and foremost... Yes, you can definitely ride trails on a hardtail and it will help you get lots of technical skills that a full suspension bike wouldn't give you, unless you jumped class (enduro) on a trail bike. Plus, it will be way more comfortable riding in the city. Secondly, given your budget, i would suggest you didn't make a custom one. Buy a new one. There are lots of good ones on that budget. 

Apart from setting up his suspension and his tyre pressure (around 27-29psi if talking about downhill bikes, tubes and tyres), he can't do much... It's all about his skills. He can only practice. Bikes don't make riders. Lack of brains does (always with the good meaning ). I have found myself riding faster than guys with serious downhill bikes, on a 120mm full suspension trail bike. Push your friend to go harder. Ride hard, ride free
