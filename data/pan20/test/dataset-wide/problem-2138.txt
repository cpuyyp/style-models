This is perhaps the issue. You are working for family at below market rates in order to keep the business profitable and at some stage, you will be allowed to pay for part of it. You are already paying for it. You are working long hours, travelling a lot (side note, family business should help with family issues otherwise what is the point), and not earning what you would elsewhere. Every month you are out of pocket to help keep the business profitable. If it was not a family business you could leave easily and get a job with better pay and terms, but obviously, this will be difficult in your situation as it would cause difficulty with family. So I would propose the following. 

By using the word "when" you are stating, obviously that a hiatus on pay rises can't be justified forever. Inflation happens, your skills improve, other companies would pay more for the same skills. By saying "we" you are not making it personal or greedy, you are merely asking after the welfare of the whole staff. You could get a flat denial that it will be happening, in which case you can not hold out much help for yourself. You could get some fluff, in which case also don't hold out much hope. It is possible also you get a specific date, or at least some concrete information which would help you on deciding if you will get your needs met any time soon. 

It is very good of you to mentor and help your reports. But I would say that this should be mostly considered in issues internal to your company. There are a vast number of morally/legally grey areas if you start to mentor on things external to the company. This includes finding new employment. If you have an HR department this is something that you should talk to them about. On top of legal moral and ethical considerations, you could find that it is something they would feel strongly about, for legal or other reasons. For example, the cost of a new hire to replace, if someone just leaves or is fired this is something the company accepts, but if you were to ask someone to leave you are responsible for the additional cost. It sounds like in this case it is OK, but should be cleared first. I don't know much about the legal implications (so don't take this as advice) but in some jurisdictions talking in such ways could be considered dismissal. And you may end up having to pay redundancy or some other compensation. So it is certainly something you may want to get advice on. Joe Strazzere's idea about getting HR involved to address his behavior is a good one. Toxic behavior in the workplace has no excuses. The only other thing that is worth mentioning is how he does not realize that there will not be an opening for him for a number of years. This is perhaps something you can address directly. If he complains you can state as you do here that it is a small company with limited scope for advancement. He would have known this on joining, and the company can't change in a way which will accommodate his needs. That way you are not directly telling him to leave but you are making very clear that the company can't provide what he wants. If he still stays and behaves toxically then that is simply an HR issue. 

It sounds like you are a little overwhelmed. There are lots of stack exchange sites where you can get help. Just work through the issues as you find them. Best case the startup does amazingly and you along with it. Worst case it crashes and burns. You have some great experience under your belt. I have never heard of anyone who thinks that working at a failed startup is a mark against them when looking for a new job. Just be ready for "So what do you learn from..." 

There are a lot of answers already but I feel they don't quite cover the family business aspect well. It sounds like you have a small, yet profitable business. You are a key part of this. Forgetting about your brother in law for a moment. This really stands out 

The first thing to note: He sounds like an HR issue waiting to happen. His behavior is not acceptable in any workplace. What should be happening is that he should be being disciplined or removed. The second thing: This company looks like it has a toxic environment, that spreads beyond your team, a transfer may not help much. Having said that you are right that moving too often may be seen as a bad thing when looking for a job, especially coupled with the advice to not badmouth a previous employer. So what can you do. While you are in the role? Manage up. Manage your boss. 

This may not work, and is totally passive aggressive, but it could get the penny to drop that the company is not allocating resources appropriately. 

Reading the answers there is some ambiguity as to your current situation. I'll answer assuming the following 

Looking at some of the comments it seems that your Father may not be used to the idea of a family business. They are very complex and fraught things. There is often ambiguity about what peoples roles and responsibilities are and where they stand with regards to current and future ownership and control. This ambiguity in many cases can be destructive. If the above suggestion does not sound feasible then at least try to get in writing what you will be getting in terms of an opportunity when and for how much. You can then make the difficult decision if it is worth it to you (both in terms of money and family cohesion). Bear in mind that there is risk as well, you could work for X years under market rate and at some stage, the company could fold leaving you with nothing. 

This type of situation is not as uncommon as you would think. It sure can feel like impending doom. It is highly likely they are trying to salvage something from their investment in something for the least possible extra investment. This is why the have only assigned one junior developer to it. Until software solves a problem for somebody in such a way that they are willing to pay for it, the software is worthless. If it needs features to get it to this stage then that is the best place to invest in the software. Spending time fixing something that nobody will pay for is not good allocation of resources. Imagine if you didn't do what you were asked and spent time fixing bugs, then at the demo a critical feature for the customer was not present. That could result in a lost sale and would be entirely your fault. You don't know the reasons for all of these decisions so stick with them. I know ideally things should be well written from the start, but you didn't start the project so can't be held responsible for the whole system. It is unlikely (though not impossible) that you are being set up to fail. It is more likely that the business is trying to make something out of what is currently a dead loss. So do what you can to help the demo go well. You have been clear from the start about the state of the code and have taken priorities from the management. If the demo doesn't go well it is not because you were not doing your job well. If your company has a reasonable culture then this should be fine. If the company has a blame culture and you get blamed for the demo or the state of the code, despite all of your advise to management then you can be more defensive next time. Get everything in writing, be more stubborn about fixing bugs. If you get called up on this then point out that you have taken the heat in the past for not doing so. Working in such a culture is not nice and you do need to watch your back (if getting another job is an option then look for one) But I would suggest giving your company a chance. Do what you have been asked as well as you can and accept that the company is a joint endeavor. 

You don't say what jurisdiction you are in, but the legality of this may be questionable. Normally a job is some kind of contract, and it may be worth checking the terms to see how and why they can do this. If you are in any doubt then consider getting legal advice. However, legality aside, this is not a good way to treat your employees. It does not show that they value you or are interested in your welfare, and there is no guarantee (or at least none that you have mentioned) that they will not get rid of the other half of the base salary. I suggest that you show as much loyalty to the company as they have shown to you, and start seeing what other options you have available elsewhere. A final word of warning. It is quite possible that on finding another position and resigning that you would find that there is an offer to increase your base salary again. This is something many employers do when an employee resigns. Be wary of accepting this offer, your current company has shown that they are trying to pay you as little as they can get away with, this attitude will not change. 

The trick is to give it the affordance of 'easily breakable'. Some people will notice it (consciously or otherwise) and steer clear, others will be clumsy and knock it when they do there will be a moment of fear as they see it nearly smash (or even smash) after which they will be more careful around it. 

You may not be able to not reply to emails all day, or to say no due to managment structure at the company however you can get yourself short bursts of time and focus. Have a look at the Pomodoro Technique, in short set a short amount of time and a definitive task to complete in that time and then focus on nothing else. You can then move back to fielding questions if there are any. If you can get a few of these focused bursts done in a day you may find your productivity improving. The trick is to make sure you shut out everything else while you are in focus mode. Knowing that whatever it is can wait until afterward. 

An interview is a bit of a negotiation. You are offering yourself and your skill set, they are offering opportunity and benefits. Any negotiation involves give and take and a bit of horse trading. There may be certain things that are deal breakers for you, some that you may be willing to be flexible on depending on how sweet the deal is. Also as a negotiation at any stage either side may walk away and decide the deal is not for them. You may not always know what the triggers for this are at the start, it involves a bit of exploration. You may also find after talking to them that things you think are deal breakers for you are not. Say you needed flexible working hours due to child care. You may think that is a deal breaker, but if you insist on 'flexible hours', you could miss that the work place has a Creche or other child care incentives. Salary is another thing, if you insist on X amount of money, you may miss that the company pays less but provides a huge amount of other incentives. So talk and listen. Work out if you want this job and how much it is worth for you, they will be deciding the same thing about you. Discuss issues as they come up. Or if they don't come up and you feel it is a big issue for you then raise it. The company may have a different set of priorities and culture from previous employers. Some things you may think are big deals may not be and vice-versa. One final thing to remember about this, is to make sure that things you agreed on are in writing (if not in the contract itself). It is all to easy to a manager to change (or change their mind), and a deal that you though you had to be forgotten (I know from personal experience). 

The upside is that he obviously rates your work otherwise he would not be wanting to take credit. But in terms of your response, I'd suggest doing nothing. Firstly, he seems to be buddies with the VP. So anything you do or say will likely not work out well for you. Even though you are 100% in the right not to like this, it would not look good for anyone if it was challenged, and even if you do get it changed it would mean life is more difficult for you in your job afterward. Secondly, does it really matter? Linkedin will only be important when looking for jobs. This guy seems to be way over promoted due to nepotism, it is unlikely he will move. It could possibly matter if both of you were applying for the same job and somebody queried but that does not seem likely. So you don't actually gain anything by trying to change it. My advice would be to ignore colleagues Linkedin profiles, you don't need to see them and gain nothing from doing so. 

You say you are a small company. This does have some bearing on the answer. A lot of companies give developers a lot of scope with what they do with their PCs. Some don't and developers get stuck trying to use their workstation with the same confines as all other employees. Smaller companies can be very set in their ways. They may have one or two sysadmins who do things their way, and don't want to change. There could even be a bit of job security involved. If they spend a percentage of their week helping you download, they look more busy to management. At the company level there is a balance between security and productivity. Developers often have more software and need to do more with their machines than most employees. So your productivity suffers more. Ultimately it is up to management to decide if they can take risk for increasing your productivity. Having said all of this you can still potentially do something about it.
