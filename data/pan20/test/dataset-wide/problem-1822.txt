You can calculate a hash (say md5sum) of the file, and then send that along for the recipient server to verify. This is a standard way of verifying the file integrity, if you are concerned. 

sudo lsof | grep -v IPv4 | grep -v IPv6 would this work for you? this would exclude only what -i lists. 

You can study livecd layout of your distro, but likely you need /var instead of /var/log and in some distros there are files in /etc that must be writable. /home as well unless you put home dir elsewhere. 

even within the same minor version, there are different kernel updates so definitely you can stay 5.4 and update your kernel. how did you compile the drivers? unless you have used dkms (search for that), you will have to recompile if you upgrade the kernel. there is something called ksplice which may do what you want. search for that again for details. it dynamically patches a running kernel to block vulnerabilities. 

OK, since you only want to reduce your access rights (rather than actually running as Peter per se) you may have some options. In Windows 7 (and Windows Server 2008 R2) the task scheduler supports this directly (via the "Do not store password" option) but I don't think there is any built-in equivalent for Windows Server 2003. Running the task this way on a different machine probably won't help because you don't get network access. It can be done in software, though, even on Windows 2003, via the CreateRestrictedToken Win32 function. A Google search found a piece of software called ulimitnt which appears be able to do what you want (via the option). Note that I've never used this program so I can't vouch for its reliability. Using this approach, the script only has access to files that grant access to both local system and to Peter. (Note that the local system account implicitly belongs to the Administrators group, so if Administrators has access that will be sufficient.) 

can you at least download the zone files? that is actually all you need. if you cannot even do that, you would have to use dig or another client to go through all the records that you know to find information, that would be painful. 

Yes you can and it is possible to install this. To verify it you can download an eval copy and try it. 

well, theoretically it is safe, because raid6 adds another parity block, so there is no data deletion. if the power goes off, conversion fails, and you go back to where you started from. however, as all good system admins know, it is mandatory to back up your data whenever you do something that could affect the data. this is just the best practice, regardless what the raid controller might do. 

Almost certainly a hardware problem. Get a diagnostic tool from your vendor and run it through. If you cannot get something like this, at least run something like memtest provided by most Linux versions, which you can run by getting a lived. If it is in warranty, it is best to ask for vendor service. 

Test Procedure The machine I'm experimenting with is PowerEdge 2970 with a DRAC 5, Hardware Version A00, Firmware Version 1.60 (11.03.03). The BMC Firmware Version is 2.50. The NIC Selection is set to Shared and the NIC is enabled. The static IP address is 192.168.241.100 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. There is no gateway on our management network so I have that set to 0.0.0.0. Auto negotiation is on. None of the other settings are configured. With the management network connected to LOM1 (and the LAN connected to LOM2) I can both ping the DRAC and log into the DRAC web interface from a production machine with access to the management network. (IP address 192.168.241.102/255.255.255.0.) I cannot ping the DRAC from a machine on the LAN (mis)configured to use 192.168.241.29/255.255.255.0, even after clearing the ARP cache. With the management network connected to LOM2 (and the LAN connected to LOM1) I can neither ping the DRAC from the management network machine or connect to it via the web interface. Clearing the ARP cache had no effect. I can ping the DRAC and access the web interface from the machine on the LAN. In both cases the operating system on the 2970 has full network connectivity on both the LAN and the management network (once the network interfaces are appropriately configured). I also tried using WinDump to look for arp replies on both the management network and the LAN. In both cases, I saw arp replies from the DRAC only on the network that LOM1 was plugged into. 

There should be no expected issues just from running this command (otherwise the man page will be full of dire warnings for sure). If things die, then it would not be due to atime update turned off, but some hardware problems you have. that remount simply turns off the atime updates and will thus have LESS disk usage and therefore make things less likely to die. Have done this sort of things many times and never see any issue. If you are still concerned and if you can later restart the system or mysql, you certainly can do so. 

that means the key exchange did not take place or failed. please download the cli tool plink.exe (same place you downloaded putty.exe) and do some debugging 

yeah, in ovf export (File -> Export). not sure if it is a good idea to save to usb directly, as usb i/o is often iffy. it is better to save to your hd and then copy. done many many times with no issues. 

You can create a DNS alias (pointing MyPhone to the DNS name of your web server) by selecting New Alias (CNAME) from the Action menu in DNS Manager. However, you'll also have to configure your web server to recognize the name MyPhone as a distinct web site, and create a redirection from that web site's home page to the URL you want, or, depending on your needs, put the content in question on the home page of that site. How you do this depends on what web server you're using. 

As documented in Description of the Windows Update Standalone Installer in Windows, is designed for installing updates in the form of files. It cannot install updates that are in files. To install an update in a CAB file, use instead, e.g.,: 

One alternative would be to use Software Restriction Policies (Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings) rather than the "Do Not Run Specified Windows Applications" user policy. This will also give you more flexibility around how you select the application to be blocked. Keep in mind that any blacklisting approach can be worked around. If you want to ensure that the restriction can't be bypassed, you'll need to use Software Restriction Policies in whitelist mode, i.e., specify those applications that are allowed to run rather than those that are not. 

Port can be reassigned to confuse people etc., so if you have a plain http server actually listening on port 443 then your http url should work, and vice versa. However the restriction you are facing may be more than just the port. Since ssl and http are different protocols, it is trivial to figure out that the packets are not http and your connection is thus blocked. It is probably easier to do ssl tunneling if your http traffic in this case. 

Could you find out the source ip distribution, say from your ISP? That would help. Sounds someone is attacking the server, or maybe the server ip used to be a high-traffic server and clients (automated) have cached it. Overall I think you should contact your ISP support who are best equipped to help you. 

If you can afford, I suggest that you use Oracle Goldengate which targets this sort of things. I used to be an Oracle DB admin a long long time ago and otherwise have no relation to them. Or else you can just export sql, massage the data, and import yourself (you can stream the delta changes to make it look like synching). The effort in that case depends how much your schemas differ and how much nonstandard SQL you are using.
