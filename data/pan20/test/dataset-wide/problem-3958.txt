A personal experience: while teaching a freshman class in combinatorial game theory I had mentioned offhandedly some of what was had been determined about outcome classes of rectangular Domineering positions. Multiple students asked about the methods that were used to determine these outcome classes. In rereading the literature to prepare a follow-up lecture I realized that a number of new things could be said, which led to this paper. 

What you say about free operads on free $\mathbb{S}$-modules being themselves free $\mathbb{S}$-modules and being describable in terms of the free non-symmetric operad is correct. In section 5.9.11 of Lodayâ€“Vallette, they construct adjoint functors between ns operads and (symmetric) operads. The free ns operad and free symmetric operad functors also admit right adjoint forgetful functors. Finally, the a free $S$-module functor on arity graded modules also has a forgetful adjoint. 

The answer is yes and you can do it more easily than you might think from the comments. Because of the way you worded your question, I'm going to assume you already know the existence of the model structure for unbounded $P$-algebras and use that in the proof. I also want to assume that your operad is concentrated in non-negative degrees so that the free bounded algebra functor behaves as we expect it to. Theorem 3.3 of Crans, Quillen closed model structures for sheaves gives criteria for transfer of a cofibrantly generated model category structure along an adjoint that are easily checkable in this case. Let $C$ be a cofibrantly generated model category with $I$ (respectively $J$) the set of generating (trivial) cofibrations and let $R:D\to C$ be a right adjoint with left adjoint $L$. You want a model category on $D$ where the fibrations and weak equivalences are created by $R$. The conditions you have to verify are that 

Let $V$ be a cocomplete category (feel free to make other strong assumptions about $V$ if I have omitted them) and $(S,\eta)$ a pointed endofunctor of $V$. Define $X_0=\mathrm{id}_V$, $X_1=S$, and $\sigma_0:SX_0\to X_1$ as the identity. Then assuming $\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_i$ and $X_0,\ldots,X_{i+1}$ are defined, define $X_{i+2}$ and $\sigma_{i+1}:SX_{i+1}\to X_{i+2}$ as the coequalizer of the following diagram: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} SX_i @>\sigma_{i}>>X_{i+1}\\ @VS\eta X_iVV @V\eta X_{i+1}VV\\ SSX_i@>S\sigma_i>>SX_{i+1} \end{CD} Then putting $\{X_i\}$ together via the maps $X_{i}\xrightarrow{\eta X_i} SX_{i}\xrightarrow{\sigma_i} X_{i+1}$, the resulting diagram $$ X_0\to X_1\to \cdots $$ is the (finite part of the) free monad sequence for $(S,\eta)$. If we make what seems to be a fairly strong convergence assumption, then the colimit $X_\omega$ of the sequence is the (algebraically) free monad on $(S,\eta)$. 

With this interpretation of $\times$ (which I believe corresponds with Eric Wofsey's in the linked question), $E_1(G,H)$ is the set $\{\{f_1,f_2\},\{f_3,f_4\}\}$. On the other hand, $E_2(G,H)$ is $\{\{f_1,f_4\},\{f_2,f_3\}\}$. 

In this case, your two structures coincide. One can test whether $\{f,g\}$ is in $E_1(G,H)$ by looking at the image under $e$ of all the putative edges it generates in $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)\times G$; the pair $\{f,g\}$ is in $E_1(G,H)$ if and only if all of these are in $E(H)$. The set of putative edges is of the form $\{\{f,g\}\times v\}$ for $v\in V(G)$. Therefore, the pair $\{f,g\}$ is in $E_1(G,H)$ if and only if $\{f(v),g(v)\}$ is in $E(H)$ for all $v\in V(G)$. But this is the definition of $E_2(G,H)$. 

Here is a partial answer. I'll assume $m$ and $n$ are the number of intersections rather than the number of squares. If both values are even, then the second player can always win by rotating the first player's previous move by 180 degrees. If precisely one value is odd, then the first player can win by removing one row or column, making it even by even. Obviously if $m$ or $n$ is $1$ then the first player can win. I expect the general odd by odd case to be much harder because $3\times 3$ is a second player win by case analysis and the strategy appears to have no symmetry. Also the Sprague-Grundy values of the subsets of the $3\times 3$ square do not seem to have any easy pattern. I think if you want more information the right thing to do is to write a plugin for cgsuite (easier than it sounds) and analyze the low odd cases and their subsets to see if you can find a pattern in the Sprague-Grundy values. 

In the references I know, a symmetric monoidal category is defined as a monoidal category equipped with some additional data, so in particular the monoidal product is a functor $$ \mathcal{C}\times \mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}. $$ The word unbiased is sometimes used to mean that there are products $$ \mathcal{C}^n\to \mathcal{C} $$ but that is not quite what I mean here. Rather, I want a monoidal category to give me an assignment for every finite set $S$ $$ \mathcal{C}^S\to \mathcal{C} $$ and for everything to be described in terms of functors involving the category of (unordered) finite sets, maybe some weak kind of functor since associativity isn't strict. 

We can modify Neil's argument in the other thread to give an example of a contractible space with no monoid structure. Let T be a tree with the following property: For each point x in T, there are at least two components of T \ x which contain an at least trivalent vertex. In particular, the complement of x must have at least two components, so T cannot contain any 1-valent vertices. For example, let T be the universal cover of the theta graph. Now suppose that T has a monoid structure. Using Neil's argument, we can get some invertibility results. Namely, let x and y be points in two different components of the complement of the identity. Then there is a path from (e,y) to (x,y) to (x,e) in $T\times T$ which holds y fixed in the first half and x in the second half. The image of this path must pass through e, so either x or y is invertible. This implies that every point in all but one of the components of the complement of e is invertible. Then there is an at least trivalent vertex g distinct from e which is invertible and a non-constant path from $g^{-1}$ to e through invertible elements. This gives a homotopy of homeomorphisms from T to T by left multiplication. The image of g at time 0 is e; at time 1 it is g. This means at some time between them, g must be taken to an internal point of an edge of T; no homeomorphism can do that. Such a T is homotopy equivalent to a point but can have no monoid structure. 

It turns out that the construction as written in the paper is incorrect, but there is a fix known to the authors. Instead of collapsing $P\otimes H\otimes P$ to $P$, one only collapses $I\otimes P\otimes H\otimes P\otimes I$ (where the $I$ factors are included in $H$ with length 1, not 0). This gets rid of the problem above and the rest of the construction checks out. Many thanks to Gijs Heuts for communicating this to me. 

Instead of connecting the nodes $i$ to nodes $v_{ec}$ whenever $i$ is in $e$, do this whenever $i$ is in $e$ and $c$ is in some set of vertices stable under the isomorphism of subgraphs. Instead of replacing all edges with a copy of $G$ or $G'$, only do this for enough edges in the complete graph to contain the two special edges and be stable under the isomorphism of subgraphs. 

The Warsaw circle is compact and simply connected but there are obvious neighborhoods with no simply connected open refinement. This provides a counterexample for the question as originally worded but does not have connected complement. It can be realized as the union of the following: $$\left\{(x,\sin\frac{1}{x}):0<x<1\right\}$$ $$0\times[-2,1]$$ $$[0,1]\times -2 $$ $$1\times[-2,\sin 1]$$ 

Answer 2, assuming that $\times$ is the categorical product, or in other words, that the edges of $F\times G$ are of the form $\{(x,u),(y,v)\}$ for $\{x,y\}\in E(F)$ and $\{u,v\}\in E(G)$. There are graphs where $E_1(G,H)$ and $E_2(G,H)$ are incomparable. Take $V(G)=\{1,2,3\}$ and $E(G)=\{\{1,2\}\}$. Take $V(H)=\{a,b\}$ and $E(H)=\{\{a,b\}\}$. Then $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ has four elements: 

Together this tells us that $Q_k(x)$ is the formal inverse of the function $$ Q_k^{-1}(x) = (1-k)x +k\log(1+x). $$ Of course, $Q_k(x)$ is not elementary but it can be written in terms of the Lambert $W$ function. It's something like the following (but I think I might have made a typo or a sign error, check this formula!) $$ Q_k(x)=-1-\frac{k}{k-1} W\left(\frac{k-1}{k}e^{\frac{x+1-k}{k}}\right). $$ In any event, one can use purely symbolic analysis of the $W$ function and a single special evaluation $$W\left(\frac{1-k}{k}e^{\frac{1-k}{k}}\right)=\frac{1-k}{k} $$ to work out a series expansion. For instance, for $k=2$ we get: $$ x + x^2 + \frac{4x^3}{3} + \frac{13x^4}{6} + \frac{59x^5}{15}+\cdots $$ which gives $a_{1,2}=1$ $a_{2,2}=2$ $a_{3,2}=8$ $a_{4,2}=52$ $a_{5,2}=472$. I'm too lazy to check whether this agrees with anything in the OEIS but this series (and those for other $k$), presumably, is well-known and can be cross-referenced there. 

As explained in my comment, this is no longer true for colimits of free operads on free $\mathbb{S}$-modules. Take a free $\mathbb{S}$-module $M$ and an endomorphism $f$ of $M$ whose cokernel are not free $\mathbb{S}$-modules. For instance, let $M$ be a free $\mathbb{S}_2$-module and let $f$ be symmetrization or skew-symmetrization. 

You are correct and the statement, as you cite it, is wrong. The counterexample you describe is well-known, and is usually cited to demonstrate precisely this failure. 

This is not an answer but you asked for an example and I couldn't give a picture in a comment. I objected that the fundamental groups might not be Abelian and suggested that it was easy for the intersections to be homotopy equivalent to wedges of circles. Here is a picture, viewed in cutaway. 

Kelly describes a constructive procedure for building the algebraically free monad on a pointed endofunctor. Garner gives a concise summary, which I partially review here for convenience. 

$\Lambda$ is correct. $\Lambda'$ is not an operad because the $\circ_i$ maps are not equivariant with respect to the symmetric group actions. If $\sigma$ is the nontrivial element of $S_2$, then for some element $\tau$ of $S_3$ we would have $$ -1_3 = -1_2\circ_2 1_2 = \sigma(1_2)\circ_2 1_2 = \tau (1_2\circ_1 1_2) = \tau 1_3 $$ but it is easy to see that $\tau$ is an even permutation. 

We can see that this is false by looking at a degenerate example. Consider any operad $P$ so that $P(n)=0$ for $n>1$. If you tensor such an operad with $C_\infty$ so that $(P\otimes C_\infty)(n)=P(n)\otimes C_\infty(n)$ you get $P\otimes C_\infty=P$, since $C_\infty(1)$ is one dimensional and $P(n)=0$ for $n>1$. But $P$ is not the same thing as $P_\infty$ in general. For a specific example, let $P(1)=k[x]/x^2$. Then $P_\infty(1)$ can be modeled by $(k[x_1,x_2,\cdots,],dx_k=\sum_{i+j=k}x_ix_j)$. 

Any simply connected polygon must be star-shaped to be shrinkable. I have made minor edits below to treat the more general case. Let $D$ be a polygon with convex hull $H$. Assume we are given a non-trivial shrinking of $D$; view this as a map from $H$ to itself. This map must have a fixed point $x$, either by algebraic topology or an iterative construction. This means it suffices to consider only dilations centered at a point $x$ in $H$, rather than dilations followed by translations. For any $x$, if there is a point $y$ in $D$ so that the segment from $x$ to $y$ is not contained in $D$, then a $(1-\epsilon)$-dilation of $H$ centered at $x$ will not carry $D$ into $D$ for any positive $\epsilon$ smaller than some $\epsilon(x)>0$. If $D$ is not star-shaped, take the minimum $\delta$ of $\epsilon(x)$ over $x\in H$, and then no $(1-\delta)$-dilation of $H$ centered at a point in $H$ carries $D$ into $D$. 

Let $P$ be the Giry endofunctor, which assigns to a space $X$ the (suitably topologized) space of probability measures on the Borel subsets of $X$. For $X$ a single point $\{a\}$, the space $P(X)$ is a single point (with element the trivial measure $\delta$). For $Y$ the discrete set $\{a_0,a_1\}$, it is straightforward to verify that $P(Y)$ is homeomorphic to $[0,1]$, with the measure $\mu_p\in[0,1]$ putting measure $p$ on point $a_0$ and $(1-p)$ on point $a_1$. Consider the constant map $c_i$ at point $a_i$ from $X$ to $Y$. Then $P(c_i)(\delta)=\delta_i$, the probability measure on $Y$ concentrated at $a_i$. Now suppose there were a natural transformation $\epsilon:P\to\mathrm{id}$. Consider the two maps $\iota_0$ and $\iota_1$ from $X$ to $Y$. Naturality of $\epsilon$ and the previous paragraph show that $\epsilon(\delta_{i})=a_i$. There is a path in $P(Y)$ between $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$, which are the endpoints of the interval. Then $\epsilon$ must take this path to a path in the discrete space $Y$ between $a_0$ and $a_1$, a contradiction. 

Koszul duality for operads gives the following method of calculation (spoiler: I'm not going to end with an explicit formula). Fix $k$ and then combine the terms in an exponential generating function: $$ Q_k(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_{n,k}}{n!}x^n. $$ In order to calculate $Q_k(x)$ we'll examine another, seemingly unrelated question which is easier to answer: Suppose we have $k$ binary functions which are mutually annihilating Lie brackets; then how many distinct expressions can we make from $n$ letters? For $k=1$ the answer is classically known to be $(n-1)!$; then since they are mutually annihilating, the answer in the general case is $$ b_{n,k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1&n=1\\ k(n-1)!&\text{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. $$ Combining these terms into a exponential generating series as above we get $$ P_k(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{b_{n,k}}{n!}x^n = x+\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{k}{n}x^n = (1-k)x -k\log(1-x). $$ Here we have calculated the exponential generating function for the arity $n$ component of the direct sum of $k$ copies of the Lie operad. Then classical results about Koszul duality theory for operads assert the following:
