Suppose $K/\mathbb{Q}\_p$ is a finite extension with residue field $k$. Fix a uniformizer $\pi\in K$ and choose a coherent sequence $(\pi^{1/p^n})$ of $p$-power roots of $\pi$, and let $K_\infty/K$ be the extension of $K$ generated by these roots. The field $K_\infty$ is arithmetically pro-finite and so we can consider its field of norms, which happens to be isomorphic to the function field $k((u))$. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a Cohen ring for $k((u))$, equipped with a lift $\varphi$ of Frobenius. Conventionally, we take this to be the $p$-adic completion of $W(k)[[u]]_{(u)}$ and $\varphi$ sends $u$ to $u^p$. Then we have equivalences: $G_{K_\infty}$-reps $\Leftrightarrow$ $G_{k((u))}$-reps $\Leftrightarrow$ etale $\varphi$-modules over $\mathcal{R}$. Although I've known this basic theory for a while, I realized I did not know the answers to some elementary questions, and couldn't immediately find them in the literature. It seems to me that these are toy examples of the theory and should appear somewhere! Question 1: Let $\chi$ be the restriction of the $p$-adic cyclotomic character to $G_{K_\infty}$. Is there a nice description of the corresponding character of $G_{k((u))}$? In other words, what is the norm field extension of $k((u))$ corresponding to $K_\infty(\mu_{p^\infty})$? Question 2: By the second equivalence, there should be a 'cyclotomic' period in $\mathcal{R}$ that transforms under $G_{k((u))}$ by the character that is the answer to Question 1. Can we write it down explicitly? 

Just an idea. I think the best way to start is to expand on the structure of the matrices $D, C$. For example, $D$ can be readily seen to be expressible in the form $$\alpha M_1\otimes I_2=\alpha\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathbf{0}^T\\ \mathbf{0} & J \end{bmatrix}\otimes I_2$$ where $J=diag(1,2,,\cdots)$. I think the structure of matrix $A$ can be expressed as $\beta M_2\otimes B$ where $$M_2=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots\\ 1 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \cdots\\ 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \sqrt{3} & \cdots\\ 0& 0 & \sqrt{3} & 0 & \cdots\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots\end{bmatrix},\\B=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\ -1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ Now the problem becomes finding $(\epsilon\beta M_2\otimes B+\alpha M_1\otimes I_2 )^{-1}.$ 

Let $\{X_n\}$ be an ergodic sequence of random variables, $X_n:(\Omega,\mathcal{F})\to (S,\mathcal{S})$ where the target set $S$ is a matrix ring. My question is, 

Lets say, $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, and $D\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements, and all the elements are $\le 1$. For simplicity, assume that $A^TA$ is positive definite. It is easy to see that $$\lambda_{\max}(A^TDA)\le \lambda_{\max}(A^TA)\cdot \max_{i}D_{ii},\\\lambda_{\min}(A^TDA)\ge \lambda_{\min}(A^TA)\cdot \min_{i}D_{ii}$$ However, are these bounds generally tight? For example, if $D$ is such that one of its elements is $1$, and all others are equal to some small number $\epsilon$, then does the lower bound on the least eigenvalue produce a sever underestimation of the lowest eigenvalue of $A^TDA$. Specifically, 

The statement appears to be wrong. What you need is for $V$ to be finitely generated. It is a general theorem of commutative algebra that, if $R\rightarrow S$ is a flat map of commutative rings, and $M$ and $N$ are $R$-modules with $M$ finitely presented over $R$, then the natural map $$Hom_R(M,N)\rightarrow Hom_S(S\otimes_RM,S\otimes_RN)$$ induces an isomorphism $$Hom_R(M,N)\otimes_RS\rightarrow Hom_S(S\otimes_RM,S\otimes_RN).$$ See Eisenbud, Proposition 2.10. If we take $R=k$ and $S=K$, you get the result about $k$-structures as long as $V$ is finitely generated. 

Serge Lang started out as a graduate student of philosophy at Princeton, but he switched to math, because he had "finished it", it being philosophy. Here's the relevant part from his biography here "After returning to the United States, Lang went to Princeton University with the intention of studying for a doctorate in philosophy. After a year in the philosophy department, he changed to mathematics and Emil Artin became his thesis advisor." 

Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field, and let $MT(A)$ be its Mumford-Tate group. It is a conjecture of Morita that if $MT(A)$ is anisotropic-mod-center (that is, it has no $\mathbb{Q}$-rational unipotent elements), then $A$ has potentially good reduction. The basic example is when $MT(A)$ is a torus: in this case, this conjecture is one of the first results one proves in the theory of complex multiplication of abelian varieties. One way that Morita's conjecture is formulated is as follows: The condition on $MT(A)$ ensures that the Shimura variety attached to it is compact, and the conjecture says that the Shimura variety in fact has proper reduction at any finite prime; a transcendental condition has been transported to the world of arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this is stronger than the formulation given above, since we are now talking about the reduction of a whole host of abelian varieties (ones that appear in the family over the Shimura variety) rather than just $A$. This leads me to: Question: Is anything known about the converse to the original formulation? Suppose that $A$ has potentially good reduction everywhere; then is $MT(A)$ anisotropic-mod-center? 

So basically I am asking, is it always best to evaluate the gradient at the point $x^n$ itself, or there can be transformations $h$ which might depend on the structure of the function $f$, that may help in faster convergence of the method? Can anybody refer me to any result in the literature that might have a link with this question? Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

Let $\{x_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ be a sequence of reals such that $x_{n+1}=g(x_n)$, where $g:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $0$ is a fixed point of $g$. My question is the following: 

I think this limit could be found, had the target set been a commutative ring, by an application of Newton's identity, but because of the noncommutative nature here, I cannot apply that principle here. Is there any way to tackle this problem? Please make reference to any material available, as I do not have any proper background on non-commutative ring theory (nor on ergodic theory applied to rings, for that matter), apart from the basics of rings. Thanks in advance. 

To expand on my comment to the question, we have the following algebraic construction (I think originally due to Robert Brown, 'A characterization of spin representations'): Let $V$ be a quadratic space over a field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. Attached to this is the Clifford algebra $C=C(V)$: it is equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading $C=C^+\oplus C^-$ and an embedding $V\hookrightarrow C^-$. The general Spin group $GSpin(V)$ consists of units in $C^+$ that preserve $V$ under conjugation. The group $Spin(V)$ is the sub-group of elements that have trivial spinor norm. So, to describe $Spin(V)$ as an automorphism group, it suffices to do so for $GSpin(V)$. Let $H$ be the graded vector space $C$ viewed as a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via left multiplication: it is also a right $C$-module via right multiplication. Then $GSpin(V)$ clearly lies within the group $U(H)$ of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$. Set $E=End(H)$: this is a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via conjugation. Define a bilinear form $\{,\}:E\times E\to k$ by $$\{f,g\}=\frac{1}{2^{dim(V)}}trace(fg).$$ Now choose a basis $\{v_i\}$ for $V$, and let $A=(v_i\cdot v_j)_{i,j}$ be the inner product matrix attached to this basis. Set $(b_{i,j})=B=A^{-1}$. Define an endomorphism $\pi:E\to E$ by the formula: $$\pi(f)(h)=\sum_{i,j}b_{i,j}\{v_i,f\}v_jh.$$ Clearly, the image of $\pi$ is $V\subset E$, where $V$ acts on $H$ via left multiplication. Let $G'\subset U(H)$ be the stabilizer of the endomorphism $\pi$. Then $G'$ preserves $V$ via conjugation, and is therefore contained in $GSpin(V)$. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that $GSpin(V)$ stabilizes $\pi$. So we see that $GSpin(V)$ can be described as the group of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$ that also stabilize $\pi$. 

Is there a method to find a tight upper bound on the given integral? Note that the integral is upper bounded by $\sqrt{\pi/2}$, and thus converges. I first thought about applying Laplace's method. However, the function $-x^2/2-a(1-e^{-x})$ is decreasing and achieves maximum at $x=0$ which is an endpoint of the domain of integration. As a result, I don't think using Laplace method is a good idea to find an upper bound. Numerical evaluation indicates an asymptotic of $\sim \frac{1}{a}$, but I am not sure how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound in terms of $a$. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. 

For example, let $g(x) = x^2$. If $x_0<1$, then we have $x_n = x_0^{2^n}\stackrel{n\to \infty}{\to} 0$, and the rate of convergence is quadratic. Note that if $g$ is Lipschitz, then I can always find an initial condition suitably so that the sequence converges to $0$ linearly. However, this estimated rate would only be an upper bound on the actual rate, as it was seen for the $x^2$ example, the actual rate is quadratic and is thus very fast. Please provide some references to relevant literature. Thanks in advance.
