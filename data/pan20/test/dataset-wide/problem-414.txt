The energy needed to blow up a planet is similar to the energy needed to vaporize it. Suppose you release some energy in the center of the earth, say with an antimatter bomb. A large amount of rock is vaporized, much of it turned to plasma. The pressure produces huge splits along the earths crust, which blast out superhot rock. The earth is split into fragments that reach kilometers in height. But nothing is moving at escape velocity. The crust and mantle fragments crash back into each other. The atmosphere is replaced with a thick layer of vaporized rock. Which cools and rains down on the surface. Suppose you released even more energy. Most of the planet is vaporized, but some fragments of the surface ride the shockwave away from the planet. Much of the planet is launched at escape velocity, mostly in the form of vapor. Some stays in orbit and some remains in a ball. The remaining mass cools into a small, metal rich planet with a ring system. 

NO Biological life has to replicate itself. Even tiny and relatively simple microorganisms can replicate in a wide variety of common environments. Robots are designed to do a job, not to make more robots. Before you can have a life form with a silicon chip brain you need to make the chips. Look at how we do that. Super high purity silicon is made using a complex chemical process. Under ultra clean conditions silicon is melted (melting point just above copper) gradually cooled to form a crystal, sliced and polished. Then its coated in all sorts of dangerous chemicals and blasted with UV light (not just scattered UV, the pattern is projected onto it). I am not an expert on this but you get the picture. Many processes, chemicals and temperatures that anything remotely resembling biology can't stand. It's also a very specific chemical process, one tiny mistake and the whole things useless. Even if a chip was produced, that wouldn't be what you want. A whole robot needs to be produced by natural forces. Complete with the complex tools it needs to reproduce and the programing to do so. Brains however can be made under common conditions with abundant materials and are forgiving to small mistakes. But they don't pop into existence on their own either. The minimum self reproducing system is what you want to look at. We have not yet made a self reproducing robot. The larger and more complex something needs to be to reproduce (and more precise) the less likely. 

First of all Food: All plants need sunlight to grow because they have to get the energy from somewhere. Insects and fungi grow in the dark but need plant matter to eat. This does not help much. Using fire to light plants would create a huge amount of heat and use an excessive amount of fuel. So the food really has to come from outside the caves. They could trade for it requiring regular bulk delivery. They could eat roots or things that live of roots requiring them to be near the surface or they could rely on things falling down holes. (very big ones then) "Glow stones", unless using total magic would be unsuitable as chemical reactions cannot produce a lot of light for long periods of time, there is not enough energy. Also if you want the stones to give off much light they better be translucent or transparent (Although a large surface area helps as well). Given inefficiencies in the batteries don't expect the glow stones to give off more light than putting a battery of the same size in a torch. (and those are carefully designed by chemists. nothing that reactive will form naturally.) (and without the off switch, it'll run down at the same rate whether in use or not) 

So long as you are happy with the creature drinking lots of water to fill up bladder like structures and then releasing it on transforming back. If suitably placed these could change the body shape too. 

The AI is code. This code can be copied to get exactly the same goals as the original. Suitable encryption can let you be quite sure that any signals are real. (If a sufficiently powerful being is toying with you then everything is suspect.) There would almost certainly be substantial inefficiencies caused by these communication and organization problems. However, if each local piece of AI has a probabilistic model of what the others might know and do, it will avoid things that have a chance of back firing. While such inefficiencies would exist, a dyson swarm round a distant star that is trying to help you is a large asset. The resources aren't being used at 100% efficiency, but they are being put to use. There may be a few AI who stick to one solar system, but most wouldn't. 

Don't. Your ship will almost certainly need a large amount of food for after they wake up and you don't want to store that much food and take it with you. Store a few frozen seeds with the frozen people. Defrost them months before and use hydroponics, unless you have the tech to synthesize food from the raw elements on board. PS 1 000 000 years would be a rather large timescale for such things. It would be 60 light years at the speed earth moves round the sun. Such ships would move faster and probably not as far at first. 

Depends on the tech. VR + weak AI : An immersive visualization that goes at the speed you need. brain implants : Learning even faster, things you haven't learned yet still a thought away. strong AI : Humans are looked after and many do very little learning. People focus on play. 

If you want to survive a nuclear strike then you don't need nearly this level of prevention. Nuclear warheads are almost always dropped on major cities because thats where they do most damage. What you want is a house that is ... 

The most economic way to get the resources is to pack everything you need to set up a civilization into a craft and go. This craft could be pretty vast or quite tiny depending on the tech level. You could have a city on a spaceship, with lots of factories or have a shower of invisible nanobot specks sent out in the hope 1 of them doesn't hit any dust. 

Yes, Such life does exist Computer Viruses. They self replicate and their fundamental units are logic gates and processor cycles. Some research equivalents even evolve through selection and mutation. $URL$ 

Unless you need particle physics powers, nanobots are what you want. String theory is only relevant at very high energies, so any string theory device will use huge amounts of power, and possibly give you a huge explosion. If you want to make and manipulate everyday objects, there is no reason to modify nuclei. Just put the right atoms in the right places. 

Encrypt a message about who wrote it in a substitution cypher. Each letter gets replaced by a different one as a random shuffle. You can then reveal the key to prove authorship. If the message is too short <10 letters, then someone could find another key that decrypted the message to a different piece of meaningful text. If it was too long, 100's of letters, then people could crack it. A shuffling of 26 letters has as much randomness as 18.8 random letters because you have fewer options left that haven't been used yet in the shuffle. eg 

Yes, Easily. A couple of men walk into the observatory in engineer type cloths, carrying a toolbox. They fiddle around and measure some things then attach a small box of electronics to the direct input, the system contains a microprocessor and is programmed to add its own signal to the incoming one. 

Yes. And lighting it is possible without unobtainium. Sunlight is 1000W/m^2. Over a billion seconds (30 years) you will need 10^12J. Direct mass to energy transformations give 10^17J/kg so that is 10^17/10^12 x30 years =3,000,000 years per kilo per meter squared. So if it has enough mass per area to give earth gravity at 1.2*10^10 kg/m^2 then it can be lit for at most 1.2*10^10*3000000=3.6*10^16 years (earth years) (actually twice as much because of night) before all the mass has turned to energy. I would recommend the maglev track idea with large tanks of matter(any) underground. These are slowly fed to mini black holes whose hawking radiation is beamed up out a hole in the ground, bounces off a mirror kept aloft by the force of the light and illuminates the ground. 

Brute force any tech. Want some nanotech? just tell this computer to simulate possibilities using an evolutionary algorithm ( + quantum theory) until perfect nanobots are developed. The computer could design almost any tech that fitted our understanding of physics in an instant.
