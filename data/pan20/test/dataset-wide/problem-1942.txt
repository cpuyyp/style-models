I can only speak for the US, but I hear that most other first world countries are even better than the US when it comes to maternity leave, so the following should also apply. 

First and foremost, make sure that they understand that your freelancing was for real, professional projects. A lot of people (particularly large companies) think that "freelancing" is just a fancy way of saying that you built your mom's sister's dog's vanity page and got paid $10 to do it. Explain the work you've done building your business relationships. Even if you weren't registered as a corporation, you were still in business. People hired you to perform a service, you (should have) filed tax paperwork accordingly, you played manager, project manager, employee, accountant, and more, and so on. Make sure that is clear from the very beginning. Once you get to the point of negotiating salary, the company has decided that they want you. Therefore, you have more leverage for negotiation than in the interview process. Explain to them that your freelancing experience is still professional experience (and may even be no different than what the company does) and that you feel you should be compensated accordingly. Oftentimes, the company will be willing to work with you, but of course, be prepared to walk away from it if you think you're being undercompensated. However do keep in mind that you might not get paid the same rate as an employee as you would a freelancer. I can't speak for other countries, but in the United States, freelancers can typically charge 2 to 3 times what their "traditional" counterparts get paid, because freelancers have to take care of their own benefits (health insurance, 401k, time off, etc) and the "employer" half of income taxes. So make sure you take your benefits into account when considering a compensation package. 

I've never heard of this situation before. Since you will be rescinding your acceptance, it wouldn't hurt for you to ask them for the reason, but you may not receive a truthful answer. The only thing I can think of is that right after giving you the offer, the company found another candidate for the position who indicated they would accept a salary 10% lower than yours. The company decided to lower your offer by 10%, knowing that if you decline, then they will just hire the other person. Whether or not it's ethical, be grateful that they decided to reduce your salary before you quit your current job. Imagine how you would feel if you quit your current job, got settled in with this company, and then they gave you a pay cut. 

Employment applications can ask for a variety of things of interest to the company that wouldn't be on a resume. These can include the following: 

Next time you walk by his desk and he's not there, look at the phone on his desk. If it has an LCD display on it, it might show his name. If not, it will probably show his phone number. Memorize the last 4 or however many digits you need to make an intraoffice call. When you know he's not at his desk, call his number and wait for his voicemail. (You'll probably want to make the call from a conference room phone so that his phone doesn't tell him he has a missed call from you.) Hopefully he will have customized his voicemail greeting to say his name. 

Don't volunteer information that you fear may give them a basis for discrimination until you have to. For example, don't include participation in organizations that reveal things like your skin color, religion, etc. on your resume. If you fill out applications, choose to not fill out any kind of demographic information if that's at all an option. By not volunteering this information, you're ensuring that they look at your skill set and not your skin color. Be persistent and keep your standards. You probably don't want to work for someone who is discriminating against you, anyway, so if you can avoid it, then avoid those companies. It will likely take some time, but don't get too discouraged. You'll find those gems who will appreciate what you have to offer, it might just take some digging. Look beyond the big job boards. Don't underestimate the value of the little boards, like Craigslist. Many of the best companies don't advertise on the big boards like Monster.com. Also see if there are any recruiters that serve your area. Most recruiters get paid by the companies looking to hire, so keep that in mind and try to avoid the ones that make you pay (especially if they want payment up front or something), but if you can find one or two good recruiters that get you results, keep them in your network. Consider working remotely, possibly for someone outside of that country. Finance IT sounds like a job that may not require you to be on the site for (or you may have a skill set that is transferable to a remote-capable position). If that is the case, then see if you can find someone to work for that is willing to hire you. Then petty things like skin color won't matter at all. This has the added bonus of potentially landing a job for a company with higher pay ranges and/or an exchange rate that works in your favor, giving you an above-average income for the cost of living in the country in which you live. Go solo. Perhaps you can become a consultant, or otherwise just work for yourself. A typical job isn't the only path to financial security, and many IT fields lend themselves well to consultant work. Any other skills you have can be marketable, too (and can be an avenue to valuable connections for your primary skill set), so don't discount your ability to, say, paint a building or room. 

You made a correct statement. As an interviewee, you have no idea who the other candidates are and therefore you couldn't possibly know if you are the best person for the job. I think the interviewer was taken aback because he had probably never heard a candidate start off their answer to that particular question like that. There is probably a lot of people out there who try to inflate their skills and abilities during interviews. The honesty and modesty that you exhibited is not the norm, especially for a question like that where you have to sell yourself. Since you got the job, your preface obviously didn't hurt. I think it could have been a positive - the interviewer may have appreciated your honesty. It's not always easy for interviewers to tell if a candidate is being honest. 

Assuming you are still interested in the position, then I think you should email the manager, but not to say "thank you" for preparing to speak with you. Instead, you should email him/her and say that you are sorry that you didn't get a chance to talk to him/her during the phone interview. Express your interest in the position, and make an offer to set up another phone interview with him. As the hiring manager, he/she would surely like to get to know a person who will potentially join his/her team. Obviously he/she will find out about you by speaking to the person who conducted the phone interview, but nothing beats talking to you directly. I think offering to speak with him/her in another phone interview will impress him/her with your initiative and indicate that you really are interested in the position. 

Even not taking the above into account, it's not uncommon for companies to account for at least one night hotel stay. Many companies will do that even for people they're just interviewing. At least one night stay is not only not an unreasonable request, but should have been built in to begin with and should be expected, especially in a circumstance like that. As a general rule of thumb - if you're expecting the person to be on the clock in a day for more than what'd you'd normally expect out of an employee, you probably need a hotel. Two nights (one before, one after) is also not uncommon, but can go either way in a short trip like this, especially if the travel time is reasonable. That would probably depend more on the individual circumstance. Is the flight crossing time zones? How intensive or complex is the training? How intensive is the employee's usual work? If the employee is a high-level knowledge worker, the training is intensive or complex (or otherwise needs a high level of retention to successfully take home), and/or the trip crosses time zones, then you may want to try for the second night. A refreshed employee is going to retain what s/he learned better, and is going to be more productive when s/he's back at work than one who's exhausted by other things. The second night isn't an unreasonable request, but doesn't necessarily need pushed too hard for. It might also be good to ask the employee if they're okay with flying back the same night. Barring getting the second night, it might be a good courtesy for you to extend to the employee the option to only work in the afternoon following the training, allowing the employee to get adequate rest. Such a courtesy can result in a more productive employee, due to their trust in you to treat them like an adult and a human being (morale boost!), and due to being able to get some extra rest. Having a butt in a chair from 9am to 5pm does not equal productivity. 

Absolutely you should send in another application for the new job listing. It is perfectly normal for someone to send in multiple job applications to a company, if that company has multiple jobs that the person is interested in. There is nothing desperate about that. The hiring manager probably receives a lot of applications for each job listing, so he probably won't even remember that you applied for the previous position. You don't need to mention that you already applied for the other position. 

It's no problem to make your own business card. There are plenty of companies that don't even issue business cards for their full-time permanent employees. You need a way to give your contact information to people you meet at these seminars and events, and the business card is the easiest way to do so. I think it'd be a good idea to put your employer's name and your title on the business card, that way people know you're employed and that information could help them to remember who you were when they look at your card. You can also include your company's phone number and your work email address, but since you say you're a temporary employee, it'd be a better idea to include your personal phone number and email address. That way people can still contact you after you leave your current employer. EDIT: Your manager doesn't have a problem with you attending those events that he forwards to you (otherwise he wouldn't forward them to you), and it wouldn't hurt to ask him if the company can make some business cards for you since you would like to attend those events. Also you can have two sets of cards if you prefer (one business and one personal), but only give one of those cards to anyone you meet, otherwise they might be confused about how they should contact you. 

Losing even a couple of hours of sleep is akin to driving under the influence. Asking this person to drive 3+ hours total in a time frame with nearly 24 hours without good sleep is risking the lives and safety of both the employee and anyone on the road at that time. Last I checked, the cost of a lawsuit and AD&D insurance payout was far more than one person's salary for a day or two and an extra night in a hotel. After that kind of day, the employee will be lucky to get up in time to even report to work the next day, let alone be productive, so you're not actually "saving" that day (they're exempt salary, anyway, so you're paying them regardless of how many hours they worked, and they just clocked nearly three days' worth of time for the sake of the company). Starting at 3am, plus the drive, plus the stress of the flight will make the employee's ability to focus on the training nearly impossible, making the training itself a waste of time and money. Any decent-sized company will have deals with hotels, bringing the cost of the hotel itself down to as little as $50/night. So even two nights will cost only $100, plus an extra meal or two. Getting an evening flight the day before will still allow the employee to work the day before (so no lost productivity), while still being fresh for the training, and a morning flight the next day won't cost you any more time/productivity, in reality, than that insane schedule (yes, on paper, it does, but consider the previous points). The employee may even be able to work up to half a day the day after training, depending on flight times (and, depending on the nature of the employee's work, they may be able to work remotely and have a later flight). 

The "tell me about yourself" question is usually just used by interviewers to gauge your social/conversational skills. There really isn't a right or wrong answer for it, but since you are seeking a job at the company, use that question to your advantage. You can tell them about about what you studied in school, what skills you have, give them a brief summary of all of your previous jobs, and then tell them how your skills and experience are a good fit for the position. Remember what skills and other requirements they mentioned in the job ad, and if you have those skills, be sure to mention that. I wouldn't bother with mentioning any personal hobbies or interests, unless they are relevant to the job. For example if you like to work on open-source software projects in your free time, then definitely mention that. But don't waste the interviewer's time by mentioning that you like to go horseback riding or anything that's not related to the job. "Tell me about yourself" is such an open-ended question that it's a great opportunity to tell them your skills and experience and to sell yourself for the job. It's the best question you could ask for in an interview. I've interviewed many people and asked that question, and a few people seemed intimidated by the question and didn't know what to say. They really blew a golden opportunity to tell me why we should hire them.
