It all depends on the horses' temperament. Some are OK, some like cars but not bicycles... Generally, horses with kids/teenagers riding them on the road will be pretty laid back. The horses that are being led by someone are much more suspect. Competent equestrian owners/staff know that any horse [that will be taken or ridden on roads] needs to be exposed very carefully (for the safety of the horse, the rider, and the general public). They have to accept that the horse may never be comfortable in that setting. But anything could spook the most experienced horse - you never know 100%. If possible, send a single person ahead to talk to who has control of the horse while watching how the horse reacts. 

I got front & rear Phil Wood hubs for a touring setup back in Oct of 2011. I'd been using them for commuting to work -- averaging 20 KM a day. Except I'd been off the bike for the month of January, started again in Feb. A week ago, things felt weird. Discussed with a fellow cyclist at work, who said it sounded like the hub was going. The following day, there was a loud crunch from the rear and the chain felt like it was slipping. I took the wheel into the LBS who built the wheel for me. They told me one of the four palls had an issue, and a spring was bent, so they corrected. I picked up the wheel today, and got 10 KM before things started again - crunching noise from the rear, and a slip. So I dropped the wheel with the LBS, who said they'll look for a rebuilt kit. What is a pawl? Is it part of the freehub? Is a rebuilt kit enough, or should I be pressing for the LBS to RMA the hub? Edit: In case anyone's interested, Phil Wood said they're aware of quality problems and wouldn't expect a rebuild kit to do much. RMA time... 

Cross-chaining on a double-ring crankset is really only an issue on the two most extreme combinations (50/27 and 34/12); so avoid those for high-power or prolonged use and you're fine on the cross-chaining issue. With the one big caveat to always trust your ears over guys on the internet - i.e. if it sounds wrong (like its rubbing much more than other gear combos), it probably is wrong. As for the "how to use" question, once you get fairly strong, you'd pretty much always be on the big ring in front except when you're doing extended climbs, which I'd define as anything long enough that you can't just stand up the whole way. Until then, I wouldn't worry too much that the only cogs (in back) that feel comfortable w/ the big ring (in front) are your 21 and 24 (assuming you avoid the 27 due to cross-chaining) - if you're mostly riding on flat ground all the time, there's no need or expectation that you'd be constantly shifting between cogs. When you encounter a climb, you just shift from the 50 to the 34 in front, when you get to the top/flat, you shift back from 34 to 50. All while remaining on the 21 or 24 in back. If that's too easy for a little climb, you'd shift up the 21 in back one or two cogs - or just stand up if it's short (e.g. bridge overpass), as standing up generally makes it feel like you just downshifted (i.e. easier) by 2 or 3 cogs. Feel free to ping me if you have any follow-up questions. 

Does anyone know if any of the popular iPhone ANT+ bicycling apps have the ability to import a GPS track? I'd like to start exploring some of the local trails/routes a bit - I've got .gpx tracks for some, but don't know of any iPhone apps that will both allow the import of the file AND feature any sort of ANT+ tie-in. I normally use digifit with speed/cadence and HRM sensors... I've got a GPS track of where I AM, but really wish there were some sort of approximate "turn by turn" for following some of the trails/routes, especially the urban ones that are not clearly marked. 

I'm looking at a Ti frame with a 135mm rear end, disc brake. And I have invested in wheels for my commuter, which is disc brake... but a 130 mm spacing. Is 5 mm enough of a concern -- impact to the frame, the disc brake setup -- that I should look for a frame with a 132.5 mm spacing if I want to be able to use wheels off my commuter? 

I wish. I can only speak for my local area, which does not. One section used to have a sign saying traffic was limited to 10 km/h, but it's been removed (I guess because few cyclists have a spedometer). Just a stripe down the middle... 

I've been browsing 700c carbon rims on ebay, and noticed most are listed with the 33/50/60/88/etc mm in the title. What does this represent? It doesn't appear to be spoke/nipple holes. Additionally, what's the general life span of a carbon rim? 

I have transported a lot of loads like this on my bicycle rack without problems. The load should be no problem for a usual bicycle rack but there might be a problem with the balance, so you will need to strap it down pretty good. With strapping down comes more pressure on the package, that might mean you might need a more stable package. For strapping I use old tubes. They are elastic, nearly unbreakable and if you form a knot it will not get off so easily. Another argument is that there is no scratching of your bicycles paint. Just use 3 of them, tie 2 trough the rack and one through the seatpost and you should be ready to go. I always have an old tube on my rack in case I need to carry some stuff. 

In Germany, all bicycle lights above a certain lumen value have to have a low beam feature, so it's pretty standard here. So, if you do not want to kludge your existing headlight get a german one, e.G. Busch und Mueller Headlights always have a low beam feature, which they especially advertise. Here is their english web page. $URL$ 

I have this bike for a year now and I am pretty happy with it. It does not allow very sportive riding, but it is nearly maintenance-less, since the chain is fully enclosed by the protector (which rattles sometimes). The rear rack allows mounting a Basket. I check the chain every 3 Months, and there are still no signs of rust or that the original oiling has diminished. The transmission is very good for city riding and pulling a trailer up a hill, but not so good for going fast on roads (35 - 40 kph max possible if you have to pedal). The brakes are also very good, the only maintainence required is filling them with some special oil, and they have no problem braking the bike going down a steep hill with a fully loaded trailer. The bike has built in lightning that is very bright, with a hub dynamo. This is a photo of my bike in action, with full loading capacity of about 60 kg (30 kg on the trailer, 30 kg on the rack). Total cost of the Bike, as you see it here (with trailer and baskets and airzound) was 1500 €, Maintenance cost is around 30 € per year. 

Say the current setup uses a zero offset seatpost, and a 100mm stem. If the seatpost were replaced another seatpost that has a 20mm offset, should offset be subtracted from the stem length? My current situation is for a road/cross frame, dunno how important that is to the topic vs mountain/etc frames. 

In my experience, if you can keep up then you can draft someone. There's no asking involved, but it is appreciated if you switch up to lead for a little while. At the speeds you're talking, with the exception of those on electric bikes, most of those cyclists will be involved in some form of cycling (track or road, mountain less so) so they aren't as bothered as others might be. Some will get "cat 6" on you, and try to drop you if they notice. The real issue is that the person leading needs to communicate their movement, like avoiding obstacles (glass, people, holes, etc). Drafting really close (wheels are close -- within 1 inch/2.5 cm, or far worse - overlapping) gets more dangerous at the higher speeds because as the person drafting, you don't have the time to react to quick braking/etc. As the person drafting, you should not be relying on the leader/person ahead to point stuff out - you should be looking ahead and around to anticipate as much as you can for yourself. 

Does an SPD/SPD-SL pedal exist? No, the cleat and retention is mutually exclusive. SPD is a two screw setup, while SPD-SL is a three screw setup... Does an SPD/SPD-SL shoe exist? Yes - these exist. The Shimano SH-R087G, for example. You'll find these lean towards road rather than offroad -- a more rigid sole, and small rubber spots to minimize the sound and harshness of walking in them. But the cleat is not recessed, so you can't walk normally. Offroad/casual shoes are SPD only, comfortable to walk in because the sole is more flexible and the cleat is recessed... It's pricey, but the Speedplay Zero system might be worth considering. Totally different cleat from the other systems mentioned (uses the old Time, four screw setup), there are Speedplay specific shoes so the cleat is more shallow than SPD-SL. 

I am using Headphones like this: They even reduce wind noise, and you can hear the music and everything around you, because they are not blocking outside noise. The problem is that in city traffic you will not hear the music, because the cars are so loud ;D Important is that they have foam, cause that reduces the wind noise. 

I got a pump with an head like this, and I use both the presta and the schraeder opening. The problem is that the automatic switching does not seem to work as well as it once did. It is pretty random where the air comes out, and most of the time it involves a lot of shaking and cursing before I can get my tires pumped up. Can I fix this somehow? The pump was not cheap, and I would like to avoid getting a new one, though the hassle of getting air out of the correct hole is annoyinng. This question is about a Pump Head, where the mechanism does work (air only comes out of one hole), but switches pretty randomly. I want to get an answer if there is a solution without replacing the head, else i would order a new pump head. 

Well. I think that you really want this you have to build something youself. Basically you will need a light without a condensator and this circuit. Just add it to the power cable and have fun. $URL$ IMHO flashing lights are not optimal because they reduce the ability to gauge distances. A better approach might be to use a really bright rear light, or one with the braking light functionality e.G. the light from Bush and Mueller Toplight Line Plus 

Last weekend, I was driving (yes in a car, something I rarely do) down a fairly steep and very curvy mountain road (thus with very poor sight lines/visibility ahead) when I noticed a cyclist in my rearview mirror. He looked "pro" and in control, but was close enough to me that I was worried that if I braked to slow down for one of these curves, I was going to have cyclist splattered all over the rear of the car. After longer than either one of us would have liked (two minutes or so), I finally got ahead of him enough to slow down a lot and pull far to the right on a stretch with enough visibility for him to pass me on the left (since he was clearly wanting to go much faster than I was comfortable with on the curves) and I rolled down my window to wave "OK" to him. As he passed he yelled at me (yelling's understandable in this cases, only have a second) about cars needing to pull aside for cyclists. I felt terrible if I'd endangered him or caused him to damage his brakes or whatever to slow his speed more than he liked. And I don't even care what the law says if I could do something better to accommodate fast downhill cyclists better in the future, I'm just trying to figure out what I should have done differently. I think the cyclist wanted me to pull over as soon as I noticed him. In retrospect I guess I could have done that safely by putting on my emergency blinkers to indicate to him I'd seen him and was planning to slow down. In the moment, I was worried about how close he was, how variable my speed was around the tight curves, how narrow the road was, and how scant little I could see ahead of me (i.e. I wasn't going to pull left to let him pass me on my right, since I could kill him if I needed to come back right quickly due to oncoming car.) Anyone have strong feelings about things I should/shouldn't do? I'm not worried about my rights - I'm far more often the one on the bicycle - so just help me figure out what I should do better next time to accommodate him if I were in similar situation.
