I think it depends a lot on your relationship with this particular leader. I've gone to my boss many times and said things along the lines of "You know boss, I think a quick pep talk from you would really give the team some much-needed energy right about now." But I've worked with my boss for many years, I give him feedback and suggestions on his work as a boss many times, and I've never felt worried about doing so. He seems to always accept my comments in the spirit they are given. Your mileage may vary - it depends solely on the two of you. Think about your relationship, then decide your course of action. 

Leave a review anyway. Pour your heart out, assuming all the while that your employer will read the review and know that it is you. Be prepared to have a conversation with your employer should they choose to question you about your statements. Anonymize your review. Remove anything that would specifically tell the reader that it was you who wrote it. Don't include your title, or salary, your location, or any other identifiable data. If necessary, put in false information for those fields, as they likely add nothing to your narrative anyway. Then, if your employer reads it and asks the entire company who wrote it, don't confess. And if asked specifically if you wrote it, lie and say "No". Wait until you leave the company sometime down the road. Then write your review. Don't write a review. Skip your desire to write about this company. 

If by "making more" you mean "getting more for this particular position", then the answer is a definite maybe. Remember there are other jobs out there, and other hiring companies. You decision isn't set in stone, nor is it fatal. 

I seldom advise people to resign without having a new job to go to. Quitting without a job waiting can easily lead to a financial situation where you need to take the first job that becomes available, rather than the right job for you. This could lead to yet another case where you feel you need to leave after a short stay. You don't want to look like a job-hopper. It's important to stay on the payroll to avoid this situation. Instead, first work hard to find your next job, then resign. Work hard to find a company that fits your needs, and where you will expect to stay for the long term. Do some research on the company, talk to others (perhaps some who already work there), and ask great questions during your interview(s). Hopefully, this leads to a better decision this time around. 

It's not? Okay, then you should just tell the company what you have done and see if they agree. If you are right, they won't feel cheated, will say "Good job! Carry on." and will continue to give you 40 hours worth of wages for 2 hours of work. Many years ago, in a college Business Ethics course, we were taught to imagine specific, personal scenarios when exploring the ethics of a proposed action. In your case consider: "Is this the kind of example you want to set for your son?" (for others: "How would your Mom react if she read about your actions on the front page of the newspaper?") 

As long as you and your manager can agree on the arrangement, it's perfectly appropriate. I know folks who have done just this. Just talk to your manager first, then agree on how to proceed. 

That depends on the company and the relationship with the client. Where I worked, if the client requested someone to be on-call, then someone was on-call - even if that request came late in the week. But perhaps your company's relationship with the client is such that you can say "No" and it won't matter. Talk to your boss or whoever owns the company-client relationship and ask if it would be okay to decline. If it is, have the most appropriate person (you, a project manager, customer support, the salesperson, etc.) talk to the client and apologize for not being able to fulfill their request on short notice. If it isn't already clear, make sure both your team and the client understand how much notice must be given for such requests in the future. And make sure there is a process for granting exceptions (there will always be exceptions). 

Generally speaking - Yes, it's okay to tell your friends the questions you were asked during an interview. Remember that not all interviewees get asked the same questions, though. And remember that you may not have understood the question, or provided an acceptable answer. The clear exception would be if you promised not to reveal those questions. That promise could just have been someone asking you not to do it and you replying "Yes", or it could have been your signature on a non-disclosure statement. If you aren't sure if you actually made such a promise ("So its possible that I might have missed it."), err on the side of caution and don't reveal anything. 

Certainly. If you search, you'll find that similar questions appear often. For a variety of reasons many employers prefer to hire people who are employed, rather than people who quit their job. And hopefully, your recuperation and job search will resolve quickly - it's amazing how fast 6 months can go by. My advice is always to find your next job first, then quit your current job. But if you can't, then you can't. Get yourself in order financially, in case of an extended jobless period. Tune up your network and your paperwork. Find a way to not be exhausted so that you can project a confident attitude. Be prepared to answer the inevitable "Why did you quit your job?" question. Then find a great new job. 

Here's the problem with this thought - you cannot know how your interviewer will take such hilarity ahead of time. Some employers will think you are amusing, witty, and will likely be fun to work with. Others will think you are immature, unable to follow simple instructions, and not worth considering. And there's no way to know what they will think until you try it. We often think we are funnier and far more clever than we actually appear to others. So unless you are feeling very lucky, or unless you don't really want the job, why bother making such a bet when you don't have to? Play it straight during interviews, and save the tricks and fun for after you are hired. 

Feelings are feelings - they aren't right or wrong. But you may need to work on trust here. Startups need everyone to be working hard on lots of things at the same time. You want your team to get together often, and if work items are discussed - all the better. I've worked in several startups, and as a CTO you simply cannot be present at every discussion. Hopefully you hire people you can trust to discuss things without your presence - otherwise your venture can never scale. Train your people to understand what conversations and decisions require your approval, and which do not. Hopefully, you have far more of the latter - saving your time for the important discussions and decisions that really matter. As your venture proceeds, your CEO will have many conversations with many people and you will not be present for all of them. If you cannot trust your CEO in that regard, your startup may be in danger.
