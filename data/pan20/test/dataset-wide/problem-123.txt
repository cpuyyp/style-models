It's technically viable, but horribly expensive. It's also not subtle. Unless launching was a lot cheaper you would need a ridiculous amount of resources to keep an army in space. You then get problems with them atrophying unless you can also provide them with training missions and simulated gravity. So no army then, how about a small special forces group? Once the cost problems are overcome the actual re-entry process is very obvious. We're talking balls of fire in the sky and sonic booms. They are not going to be subtle at all. Not great for special forces. The great ball of fire is also a perfect target for defenders to use to pinpoint the soldiers as they come in, but trying to decelerate by any other means would be incredibly expensive in fuel or very slow, or both. A vehicle shaped for re-entry is also not well shaped for flying in regular conditions, you would have limited maneuvering ability. In fact the most likely scenario is a drop pod that after re-entry the military forces bail out of and then use parachutes (possibly HALO) to close in on the target. So you're expensive, noisy, obvious and vulnerable. Not a great combination. The one thing you do have going for you is speed. You would orbit the planet 15 times every day which means you could deploy to any location within a few hours. 

For most questions like this all we can say for sure with our sample size of 1 is: We don't know. There is no reason that having multiple genders is required to develop intelligence. We're fairly sure that being social is a requirement, but mono-gendered species could still be social. In fact they might be more social and their relationships more complicated than ours since they don't have the automatic gender-based demarcations. So it is certainly plausible that they could be, although as others have already suggested your setup is highly implausible. How do a race of pacifists survive against a saber toothed tiger? There will be predators, those predators will evolve to eat them. They will need some form of defense. Honestly I think you've asked the wrong question here, it might work better if you set out what you are trying to achieve and then ask how to get there as I have several ideas for ways to evolve a pacifist intelligence. 

This depends on whether the magic using gene gives you a competitive advantage. If it does then you will tend to have more magic users breed and they will also become more likely to pass it on to their offspring. In other words unless it also comes with a "penalty" you will end up with most of the population having it after time. One way to prevent this would be to have it work a bit like sickle cell anemia. Having a few sets of "magic genes" is great and gives you magic. Having too many though gives you progressively worse and worse side effects. This would keep the pressure balanced to give you an equilibrium between some people being magic but not so many people having the magic gene that their heads explode (or whatever happens that prevents you breeding when you have too many). 

I like ArtOfCode's answer but wanted to add one more touch: When a rewinder uses their power they start going back in time. As they do so a "bubble" spreads out from them at the speed of sound (this will take several hours to cross the entire planet). I picked the speed of sound just because that's how long it will take most of the changes you make to ripple out. Speed of light is another obvious candidate but would be too fast. Just picking an arbitrary speed would also work but it feels better if there is some significance to the speed. As the bubble reaches any rewinder they get pulled into the rewind, they can either actively help it, allow it or resist it at that point. This means that small and localised rewinds, for example going back a few seconds, are normally hard to stop. As you go back further and further in time though you need more and more rewinders to either allow it or help push it through since the bubble grows larger and larger including more and more of them. Two rewinders in hand to hand combat would not be able to use the power much at all, two in a gunfight may be able to rewind a fraction of a second here or there. 

While I agree with the others that the body plan you suggest is unlikely, a slight alteration would make it work. Have mouths in the hooves as suggested, however nothing behind them. They just grab the food and chew it, storing it in a small area around the size of a mouth and with a few enzymes similar to our saliva. The actual "mouth" would be in the center of the body. The hooves grab the food and then deliver it to the "mouth" after chewing it just by bending up and pushing it in. This could be explained as evolution from a starfish like design, with grasping limbs and a central mouth. One limb evolved into the sensing "head" and the others for grasping and locomotion. 

Imagine a pair of black holes in orbit around each other. I'm wondering how this would distort their mutual event horizons. In fact would it be possible to "break" the event horizons by reducing the escape velocity below the speed of light at the point in between the two holes. If my mental model is right there would be a saddle point in between the two holes. In theory you could climb out of the hole up to the mid point of the saddle where the red dot is and then turn and climb up the ridge to escape entirely. 

The steel is buried inside the concrete and protected from the elements by that concrete. Without being exposed to oxygen or water from the air it can't rust, so there is no advantage to be gained by using stainless steel... 

Dust in the upper atmosphere similar to an Impact/Volcanic/Nuclear winter could reflect away heat. Stripping out greenhouse gasses would cause it to retain less heat. 

Drug or knock the wizard unconscious. If he is caught unaware then this is easy, if not then you might need to sneak it into his food. Once he's unconscious take him a long way from any humans. For example the center of a desert, a small ship on the ocean, etc. Set up a time-delayed device to kill him. Get everyone at least 2 miles away. Time delayed device might be a guillotine on a time trigger, or weight down the wizard and put a small hole in the bottom of the boat so it sinks eventually, the means doesn't matter so long as no-one needs to be within a mile and it kills the wizard before he wakes up. 

What you are asking about is called steganography. $URL$ There are plenty of examples of how to do it, but the simplest way is to create your basic material. If that's your mad ranting then just rant away. Once you've done that take your material to encode and go through inserting it into the ranting in a suitable fashion. Whether it's certain points or things highlighted in a certain way, or whatever. 

With the invading army in that state the fairies need only trigger a few avalanches or just sneak in and start stabbing the people around the edges of the camp every time the invaders try to rest and before long there will not be much army left. 

As already mentioned the problem with this concept is the mass, you're needing to accelerate the dead mass of the asteroid as well as all the working bits. There are possible some drives where that would not be a problem (for example using a warp drive of some kind, although even then you would need to synchronize velocities with the destination when exiting warp) but the options are pretty limited and even warp drives would most likely need more energy for more mass. The advantage though is the raw materials. When setting off on a voyage where population may expand, advances may be made, etc, then having a huge chunk of raw material available to refine, hollow out, re-purpose, etc could be very useful. But more useful than just transporting a stockpile of already refined materials? Probably not. Although with the refined materials you do run into the issue and benefit of having to decide in advance what you need rather than just hauling a huge chunk of rock and hoping it has something useful.
