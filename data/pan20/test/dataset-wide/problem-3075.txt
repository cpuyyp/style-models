You know that the full name of the Gallic emperor was Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus. Gaius was his personal name, and either Esuvius or Tetricus was his Nomen or clan name. If Esuvius was his Nomen or clan name Tetricus would have been his cognomen, the name of his family within his clan. The son and caesar and possibly co emperor of Tetricus was also named Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus though usually known as Tetricus II in English. If Tetricus was a cognomen, it is important to note thatCognomen were hereditary and passed on from one generation to the next, and that many cognomen have obscure and uncertain meanings and it was common for a cognomen to be based on a nickname. So if the meanings of Tetricus include cheerless or dark, the original Tetricus ancestor would have been nicknamed Tetricus because he was either gloomy or cheerful, depending on if the nicknamed was meant literally or ironically. Considering the scant available information about 3rd century Roman history I doubt that there is a recorded anecdote about why the ancestor of the Gallic emperor was named Tetricus. 

English country houses varied a lot in size and technology and the era they were built in. The cost and number of workers who built them no doubt greatly varied. Legend claims that William Beckford was so eager and impatient while building his legendary Fonthill Abbey that he employed hundreds of workmen and had them work in shifts around the clock with hundreds of torches for light at night. Yet it took 17 years from 1796 to 1813 to build. 

The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. $URL$ John Brown was planning to overthrow the governments of the slave states or force them to abolish slavery. Article four section four says: 

The question is flawed. It assumes that only a Queen regnant sharing power with her husband or other partner could ever sign laws and other government documents in the absence of the male ruler. That is not the case. It was perfectly possible for a queen consort to sign sign laws and other government documents in the absence of her husband. On 13 May 1888, Princess Isabel of Brazil signed the lei aurea or Golden Law abolishing slavery in Brazil. She was acting as regent while her father the emperor was in Europe for medical treatment. Empress Isabella was the regent of Spain in 1529-1532 and in 1535-1539 while her husband, Emperor Charles V was away. No doubt she signed a number of bills into law. At that time the rightful ruler of Castile, etc. was her mother-in-law Queen regnant Juan la Loca ("Jane the Insane") but she had been called insane by her father King Ferdinand II of Aragon and her son and co-king Emperor Charles V and locked away with no outside contact. After Emperor Charles V came of age he put female relations in charge of the Netherlands; his Aunt Margaret widowed Duchess of savoy until 1531 and his sister the widowed Queen Mary of Hungary and Bohemia until 1555. Emperor Henry V left his wife, Empress Matilda or Maude (later claimant of the English throne) as the regent of Italy from 1118-1119. And there are many other examples of queens consort without any political power while their husbands are in the country ruling while their husbands are away. Thus it would seem logical that Queens regnant who were co rulers with their husbands could sign laws and other important documents while their husbands were out of the country. But of course the best answer would be actual proof of the procedure in specific cases. 

$URL$ So the New Cambridge Modern History Volume 6, page 627, claims that a tribute to the Tatars was last paid in 1683, 203 years after the standoff on the Ungra River. The source is given as Sumner, page 77n. Thus I suspect that Muslim or Turkish historians may often claim that Russia was legally a tributary of the Crimean Khanate - which was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire - on and off until 1700, 220 years after the standoff on the Ungra River. I guess that some historians could claim metaphorically that the Tartar Yoke was not lifted until the February Revolution in 1917, soon to be replaced by the Communist Yoke in the October Revolution. The Princes of Moscow became the Grand Princes and Tax collectors for the Golden Horde. And they used that position to tyrannically usurp more and more power from the other princes of Russia. Thus they may have dragged their feet in revolting against the Mongols and used the Mongol threat to justify collecting taxes (to keep the Mongols from devastating Russia) until their control of Russia was strong enough that they could keep on collecting taxes and oppressing Russians without Mongol backup support. Thus after revolting from the Tartars the Russian grand princes and Tsars continued the Tartar yoke and oppression even after gaining independence from the Tartars. Thus one could say the Tarter Yoke continued, now being imposed by Russian rulers. 

It has been claimed that King Edward the Confessor chose Earl Harold Godwinson as his successor on his deathbed in January 1066. I googled "did Edward the Confessor name Harold his heir?" and got about 651,000 results. On the first page that came up: 1) Wikipedia: Edward the Confessor. 

In the first half of the 19th century various fur companies trapped and traded with Indians in the US west. I am not familiar with with the various companies but the companies were probably chartered, if at all, in various states of the United States instead of being chartered by the federal government. For example, the partnership of Bent, St Vrain & Company (1830-1849), a trading business headquartered in St. Louis and thus chartered in Missouri if anywhere, traded in the USA, Texas, and Mexico and built Bent's Old Fort in Colorado as a fur trading post by 1834 at the latest, and had other trading posts like Adobe Walls and Fort St. Vrain. The American Fur Company (1808-1847) of John Jacob Astor, headquartered in New York City, rose to have almost a monopoly of fur trading in the United States and the Oregon Country and traded as far as China. It was likely to be charted in New York State if anywhere. Medieval merchants in various cities in the Holy Roman Empire and other countries organized themselves into the Hanseatic League to promote their interests, a league that became so powerful it sometimes fought wars against countries that included some of the Hanseatic cities. The Hanseatic cities didn't need to be independent countries to have successful international trade and even to fight against some of the countries that contained Hanseatic cities. A company successful in national and international trade does not have to be chartered by an independent national government. It can be chartered - if chartered at all - by a dependent governmental unit. Furthermore, your statements that: 

I have found another alleged Descent from Emperor Louis III to Emperor Henry VII but it also has one or two uncertain identifications. Emperor Louis III (882-928) Son of Ermengarids and Boso. King of Provence 890. King of Italy 990. Crowned Emperor 901. Captured and blinded by Berenger in 905. Louis continued to reign in Provence, but Count Hugh of Arles ruled. Louis was betrothed in 900 to Anna, Daughter of Emperor Leo VI, and perhaps married her. Louis married 902/05 Adelais. $URL$ Charles or Charles Constantine (905/10-962) Count of Vienne. $URL$ Richard (d. 962 or later). Son. Childless?$URL$ Hubert. (died 962 or later) Brother, son of Charles Constantine. Possibly identical with Humbert Count of Belley. In turn Humbert Count of Belley might possibly have been the material uncle of the ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ $URL$ Adelais sister of Humbert Count of Belley and thus possible daughter of Charles Constantine. Possible mother of Humbert I Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ So we will trace the heirs of the Counts of Savoy as possible heirs of the Carolingian emperors. Humbert (970/75-1047/51) Possible descendant of Charles Constantine. Ancestor of Counts of Savoy. Count of Maurienne and Chablis. $URL$ $URL$ Amedee (995/1000?-1051) Son. Amadeus I Count of Maurienne and Chablis. No surviving children. $URL$ Burchard (995/1000?-1068) Younger brother. Archbishop of Lyon. Childless. $URL$ [Odo (1017?-1060) Younger brother. Count of Maurienne and Chablis 1051, Margrave of Susa] $URL$ Count Peter I of Savoy (1047/49-1078) Margrave of Susa. Son. $URL$ Amadeus II Count of Savoy Margrave of Susa. (1048/50-1080) Brother. $URL$ Count Humbert II of Savoy (1072-1103) Son. $URL$ Adelaide (1092?-1154) daughter. Married King Louis VI (1081-1137) the Fat of France.[$URL$ Louis VII (1120-1180) King of France. Son. $URL$ Marie of France (1145-1198) daughter.

Married future Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople (1171-1205). $URL$ Margaret II (1202-1280) Countess of Flanders and Hainaut. Daughter. Married first Bouchard d'Avesnes (1180?-1244). $URL$ Baldwin of Avesnes (1219-1295) Son. $URL$ Beatrix d'Avenes (d. 1321) daughter. Married Count Henry VI of Luxemburg (1250?-1288) $URL$ Emperor Henry VII (1274-1313) Son. $URL$ See also post number 36 here: $URL$ Bu this all depends on if Hubert son of Charles Constantine is the same person as Humbert Count of Belley and if the sister of Humbert Count of Belley was the mother of Humbert Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy.
