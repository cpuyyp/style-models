The Buddha also explains in other suttas the complexities of kamma that it's not true that all people who do evil go to hell or that all people who do good go to heaven, some people who do evil still go to heaven and others that do good go to hell. 

Also in MN 12 The Buddha explains how following a certain diet didn't help him achieve enlightenment: 

I don't know what the dream means, it could mean nothing or something but whatever it means would be irrelevant to achieving arahantship. 

It is difficult for humans to understand the dangers of sensual pleasures, including sex pleasure. I remember in the past I thought the same but after achieving higher states I saw how sex pleasure causes painful feelings in the future, just as The Buddha had said: 

Now modern science shows that eating too much is bad probably because the body wasn't designed to be digesting food all the time. The FMD (Fast Mimicking Diet) has gained popularity as well showing great health benefits so far. One meal a day (with calorie requirements) may or may not improve health, but will certainly improve self-discipline. 

Therefore try to concentrate and pervade your entire body and mind with loving-kindness on a daily basis to gain these 11 advantages. 

During The Buddha's time, he was just another teacher in India, there were many others teachers and dhammas already existing in India. I can't find the suttas detailing the number of followers The Buddha had during his time but probably still at least 10,000 (including lay followers). In ancient times that's how things start off, they only become popular later on. The majority of people all around the world were illiterate prior to the 17th Century so transmitting information was done primarily orally and verbally. Spreading ideas in ancient times was much more difficult, and still in modern times it would be difficult. Scientology for instance only gained popularity later on in time. Christianity and many other religions also started off very small and only gained popularity much later on in time. There are a few hypotheses to explain why Buddhism didn't gain popularity in India later on: 

Buddhas: Buddhas are viewed as Supreme Beings. Buddhas and arahants are viewed as higher (or superior) to Maha Brahma and other beings in the universe under samsara. The Buddha also has superior supernormal powers to Maha Brahma as well. 

I don't think so, how can anyone believe that Maitreya would appear in this lifetime? The main sign of Maitreya's arrival is the life span being around 80,000 years. During The Buddha's time He said: 

Jesus didn't exist during The Buddha's time, there are some Buddhists who consider Jesus to be at least a higher being, but it is uncertain if he actually was an arahant or Buddha. He obviously can't be Maitreya Buddha, but he could be an arahant or pacceka Buddha. It could be that he took birth from the Brahma worlds but is not actually an arahant or it could be that he really was an arahant or Buddha. Some people think that Jesus traveled to India. The Buddha (and many of his disciples) had superhuman abilities and walked on water, it's mentioned over and over again as one of the iddhis that people attain: 

Which is basically the same as now in modern times. The life expectancy among people that had food has been like nearly the same since ancient times. But arahants and paccekabuddhas still can arise during the time-period in between the appearance of a Sammasambuddha. The distinction between paccekabuddhas and sammasambuddhas is that sammasambuddhas are considered as Supreme Teachers but paccekabuddhas can still teach just not as well. 

Mahayanists believed that The Buddha allowed meat-eating during his time in special conditions which no longer apply. During The Buddha's time monks had to beg to get food and without food humans die! Certainly monks living independently that have to produce their own food (rather than begging as was during The Buddha's time) would have to kill animals to gain meat, which would violate Theravada Buddhism as well. Mahayanists also argue that The Buddha used supernormal powers to avoid the negative effects of meat-eating which the majority of monks in modern times cannot do. I guess I understand both sides of the argument, obviously if you have to produce your own food you would have to kill animals to get meat (or wait for them to naturally die which would be too rare). I don't personally stress or encourage vegetarianism or veganism. I've personally found that things like caffeine have a much more negative effect on the brain than meat-eating. From my own personal observations there may be some conditions when eating meat causes demerit and others when not (similar to what The Buddha says) but other things seem to matter much more so I don't focus on it much and still eat meat. 

Did you think it would be that easy, to just get rid of those negative feelings and achieve arahantship, enlightenment (the ending of mental fermentations, nibbana the highest bliss)? Even during The Buddha's time when The Buddha was alive and teaching there were not that many arahants in the world (a few thousand or so I can't find the exact number). 

The Buddha also explains how an evil deed can take one individual to hell but for another individual gets experienced here and now and barely appears for a moment, depending how developed the individual is in body, virtue, mind, and discernment: 

Certainly vegetarians and vegans don't abstain from damaging seed and plant life. In Mahayana Buddhism: 

The stereotype portrayed in the media of Buddhist reincarnation (after death one is born as a human again) is here stated as extraordinarily rare by The Buddha himself. The majority of humans and devas after death go to hell, the animal womb, or the realm of ghosts instead of being reborn as a human or a deva in a heavenly world. The Buddha also explains in the Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta (MN 135) how one can exhaust their good and bad kamma in a human state instead of in a heavenly or hellish world. The Buddha also explains in the Maha Kammavibhanga Sutta (MN 136) how it's not true that all good people go to heaven or that all evil people go to hell and that some evil people go to heaven and some good people go to hell by explaining the different variables involved (one's past kamma, later kamma, views at the time of death). This means the people in bad areas with bad childhoods, high crime and poverty are exhausting bad kamma as a human but didn't necessarily come from a hellish world in their previous existence (they could've been in a heavenly world prior but are now exhausting their hellish kamma). 

If you want to live long (as long as the aeon or kappa) you should try to develop concentration (iddhi power). 

It is clear that women can achieve arahantship equal to the Buddha and other male arahants, the question is why did The Buddha not want to have nuns until Ananda begged him to? I think I know why: 

Superhuman abilities are described many times in the suttas like the Iddhipada-vibhanga Sutta and many others. Of course they are real and not metaphors or vain myths. But there are many other abilities outside the basic categorizations (as mentioned by The Buddha himself). Once one achieves a certain level of concentration they can experience all types of superhuman abilities. They are categorized in a certain manner in the Pali canons called the "six higher knowledges" or "Abhijñā". I saw a documentary a long time ago, called something like "The KGB Paranormal Files" about the Soviet Union researching psychic powers encountering Tibetan monks rumored to have all types of psychic powers. They did experiments with some monks and asked them to concentrate on breaking a skull and within moments it really happened. I found the video, here it is $URL$ For me personally I've only experienced subtle powers like sometimes knowing the minds and perceptions of others, healing myself, and experiencing extreme enjoyment from the destruction of asavas. I know that with practice almost anyone who develops concentration would be able to achieve superhuman powers with little difficulty, it's not as a hard as it seems. With proper training it would probably only takes months or less of practice. But I'm not very interested in developing superhuman abilities right now because it seems unnecessary and not useful to me given my current state. I'm only interested in the ending of mental fermentations (asavas) because it's very useful to me to experience such enjoyment and put an end to the perpetual cycle of misery. The thought arose in my mind "What is the point in having all types of superhuman abilities if one still experiences fear, anger, sorrow, boredom, and other miserable states?". With the destruction of asavas I would experience extreme enjoyment, stand fearless, doubtless, sorrowless, just enjoying this eternal moment. So what greater power could there be? Right now I'm focusing on developing mind-exercises to end mental fermentations (asavas) since exact precise methods seem to have either completely disappeared or are hidden well during this time-period. All that's leftover now in modern times are vague teachings and ideas, not exact precise methods. I hope to become an arahant or paccekabuddha in this existence. After that achievement I would be able to develop other superhuman abilities easily if I wanted. Here are some of my personal experiences: 

Nibbana is outside of the realm where concepts like "permanent" and "impermanent" exist. The Creator (Brahma) exists but is temporary (even if His existence is for an extremely extremely long time-period) and is subject to the laws of kamma. 

So it's important to emphasize the ending of mental fermentations (asavas) above everything else as The Buddha himself said that ascetics who torment and afflict the body even while following many of the same rules that Buddhist monks follow lead a life that yields pain in the future (to lower destinations like hell). 

For me personally I notice that I can remember most things much better if I orally recite it a few times rather than if I try to visually memorize it so oral recitations are really useful for me. I had memorized many things this way like my credit card numbers, driver's license number, etc... I also think that humans in general may learn many things better without writing (learning orally, using images, video, or through experience). So it may be a good direction for society to abandon writing or lessen the use of writing in the future. Just imagine if you achieved arahantship would writing things down really help anyone out in achieving arahantship (the ending of mental fermentations)? It's experience vs. reading. Would reading archery books (with no images, video, etc...) cause someone to become an excellent archer or would the actual experience of practicing archery cause someone to become an excellent archer? In many conditions reading something won't matter or help much at all whereas experience really matters (for everything in general). I notice that even if I give exact precise instructions a lot of people still won't get it or achieve anything. So it makes sense to me that The Buddha didn't care about writing things down. In the future since a food/water crisis seems likely writing may be abandoned or only reserved for some few. We're cutting down trees and using lots of resources on literacy and reading/writing instead of on food, water, and shelter. The difference between literate vs. illiterate is oral vs. written. That's really it. Remember in the Dhammapada The Buddha says: 

Yes, hell exists in Buddhism as a literal real place as real as this world we live in, but there many hellish worlds and they are temporary (though many can last for extremely long time-periods). In reality the concept of hell might have originated in Buddhism because early Hinduism does not seem to have the concept nor does early Judaism or the majority of pre-Buddhist religions, they have only vague ideas and concepts. Buddhism is among the only religion where hell is central concept, described in high graphic details, highlighted and emphasized all the time. Most certainly it was not added in because it is found everywhere in earliest scriptures. This makes me wonder if NT Christian writers had copied the concept of hell from Buddhism since there were many Greco-Buddhists. The Greek concept of hell is vague and only somewhat like the NT Christian version which seems to more resemble Buddhist hell. It would be much more reasonable to argue that hell was added into NT Christianity than added into Buddhism, because the evidence shows Buddhism as the probable originator of the hell concept. Which other recorded figure had ever described hell in such high graphic details before The Buddha? The Buddha says: 

Nibbana is the highest bliss, highest enjoyment, with fermentations (asavas) put to an end how can someone cry, be fearful, sorrowful, angry? Experiencing such an extreme form of enjoyment why would anyone cry? Doubtless, fearless, sorrowless, angerless, calm, and happy walks the arahant. 

Do you think sex pleasure is temporary or permanent? Do you think sex pleasure leads one towards enlightenment here and now? Do you think sex pleasure can cause unwanted pregnancies and STDs? It is important to also note that giving up sex pleasure by itself does not make one enlightened, it simply makes achieving enlightenment easier. What actually causes enlightenment is the destruction of taints. My suggestion for the lay people attracted to sexual pleasure is to get married to avoid sexual immorality and try to achieve higher states. 

No matter how hard someone tries to make a fire even if they are willing and capable if their method is wrong they won't succeed. In the same way no matter how hard someone tries to achieve arahantship even if they are willing and capable if their method is wrong they won't succeed. It is doubtful that there any arahants or paccekabuddhas in the world right now. Even during The Buddha's time with his assistance and teaching there were only a few thousand arahants in the world. Since you could say that only arahants, paccekabuddhas, and sammasambuddhas understand Buddhism you could say that it is doubtful that anyone in the world right now understands Buddhism. There probably are however some humans in this world who have achieved higher states (jhanas) and developed iddhi powers (concentration) but still haven't achieved arahantship (the ending of mental fermentations), and also many who mistakenly believe themselves to be enlightened. 

Also in the Maha Kammavibhanga Sutta (MN 136) The Buddha explains the complexities of kamma that it's not true that all people who do good go to heaven or that all people who do evil go to hell (some people who do evil go to heaven and others that do good go to hell). From my personal experiences I know that you can exhaust lots of negative kamma in a few seconds time if meditating correctly. In the future there should be a way to objectively measure the kamma inside of you. 

Some people think that the lifespan of 10 years already happened in the past temporarily and now we are in the age when the lifespan will go up from 80 to 160 but others think that the lifespan will soon go down to 10 years briefly then back up eventually. Of course there probably will be a global food crisis in the future (which means the lifespan would go down dramatically) but then it would probably go up from there. "A scientific model has suggested that society will collapse in less than three decades due to catastrophic food shortages if policies do not change." ($URL$ Without food people kind of die, so the life expectancy would go down dramatically if a food crisis breaks out. According to modern scientists, there is no fixed theoretical limit on the lifespan (Gavrilov, L. A.; Gavrilova, N. S. (1991). The Biology of Life Span: A Quantitative Approach. New York City: Starwood Academic Publishers. In Gavrilov, Leonid A.; Gavrilova, Natalia S.; Center on Aging, NORC/University of Chicago (June 2000). "Book Reviews: Validation of Exceptional Longevity" (PDF). Population Dev Rev. 26 (2): 403–4). Many researchers already believe that humans will eventually live to be thousands of years old in the future. "We will be able to live not just a little bit longer, but a lot longer, and to look younger as well. We are on the verge of a number of separate medical breakthroughs that together will allow us to live to 150. These technologies will definitely be available" (Harvard Medical School genetics professor Dr. David Sinclair, $URL$ The prediction is that the lifespan will first go down to ten briefly then up to twenty to forty to eighty to one sixty, etc...until eighty-thousand. My personal opinion is that the food crisis not simply possible but likely. So much evidence shows us that it's going to happen yet so few humans are prepared for it. Right now I envision the world population in the 2200s as 500 million or less. I'm sure if you told someone in the year 2000 that the food price index would be more than double in ten years they wouldn't believe you.
