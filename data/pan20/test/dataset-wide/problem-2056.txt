Ugh. What a horrible situation for you to be in. In your shoes, my goal would be to be fair and direct with everyone involved. First, you can respond to Mavis and say that you're unsure of whether you should take her classes. You're new, you don't know how this sort of thing is usually handled. Make sure that Mavis knows that you're not trying to steal her classes. You had no idea why management wanted you to do more classes. There is no need to create a bad situation between you and Mavis because management didn't handle the situation well. Second, you should tell your manager that you were offered Mavis's classes. If you want to take some or all of them, now is the time to register your interest. Again, you didn't know about the existing situation between management and Mavis, so your goal is to make sure that management knows that you're trying to do the right thing. Most importantly, you should reflect on this experience with your management. It sounds like they didn't do a great job in informing Mavis about this upcoming change. Is this a simple mistake, or is it a pattern? If management isn't informing its staff when there are potential problems or otherwise giving useful feedback to help their staff be better, you could find yourself in Mavis's shoes sometime in the future. 

Prospects vs. clients I starred your question because it is a good question, and it reminds me of some of my earlier prospecting efforts. My first question for you is this: Are they actually your client or just a potential client? They're not your client until they have actually signed something like a contract or a proposal that formalizes your working relationship with them. At this point, since all they have done is respond to your initial email, they are not your client yet - just a semi-interested prospect who did give you a positive initial response. My experience with this I'm a full-time freelance consultant, and I get frequent emails from offshore developers who saw my website and want to make an app for me. To me, getting an app made is just not priority. I'm working on too many other things and don't see any business need or ROI for it. So if those emails are the same copy-and-paste letter that nearly all of them send, they typically go straight to the trash. If the emails are actually to me and understand something about my business, I typically will reply with a polite no. Project priority You're following up very persistently (and probably annoying the client, if your emails are not just reaching the spam folder). It's not a surprise to me that you've been ignored. Based on how frequently you are emailing, you are treating this as an urgent project even though it is not giving you any income. But even though small businesses are sometimes more agile and faster-paced than larger organizations, they are unlikely to decide something about an app this quickly unless they also see it as a priority. And you won't get them to see it as a priority with a lot of arguments I typically see for having an app (like "Everybody has an app!" or "It's another channel for you to get sales"). You probably need a much stronger business case for getting the client's attention and getting them to raise the priority of this project. If you're able to develop that business case and convince them of the ROI, you definitely should be paid a fair amount for the project. Commodity freelancers typically do not know how to do that. They just offer the client their design and/or development skills as a commodity, and that's it. Free work - and changing their minds You mentioned that you suggested this project to them as a free project rather than a paid one. Free clients tend to not put a lot of value or priority on the work you are delivering. After all, the work was not worth enough for them to pay you any money for it. However, even though the project is free to you, it's not free to them. They're still paying their employees for the time they spend in a meeting with you. Furthermore, in working with other businesses, it costs them time, effort, and (yes) money to manage the project. You're not likely to just make one revision of an app for another business and have the client accept it and use it with open arms, without any pushback. If I were you, I'd just move on and seek paid work - even if you have nothing in your portfolio. Even if you did deliver the project on spec like this, there's a strong chance the client wouldn't use it. Designing and developing the app would just be a waste of your time. Most of the freelance job postings I see for app designers and developers ask for examples of apps that you have in the major app stores. Getting an app to that point is a lot of work and requires complying with comprehensive guidelines. These guidelines can change in the future and create even more free maintenance work for you. Another prospecting strategy Ed Gandia, a freelance writer who also does business coaching for other freelancers, recommends a prospecting sequence with a nurturing list (look for the section called "Dealing with the non-respondent"). That is what I would recommend for you. If the prospect is not responding now, you can go a couple of routes: 

To address the other issue you brought up, of your wife wanting to feel more included and all, there's another solution that would probably be better - especially given the culture. Go to a few of the coworkers that you work closer with or get along well with and tell them "Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to grab lunch with my family and I on [day]. You can bring your family too, and I was going to invite [other coworkers] as well." This gives your wife the opportunity to get together with you during the work day, and meet some of your coworkers, without disrupting anyone in the office. You also get the opportunity to get to know some of your coworkers out of the office and maybe make some new/closer friends with them. You might also be able to combine this with the above tips (wife comes in, give her a quick tour as you gather everyone who's joining you for lunch, and then head out). I'd try to keep the gathering fairly small though just so you don't overwhelm whatever restaurant you go to! Having a group of 5-8 people is fine, and you'll probably be OK getting a table (even if there's a bit of a wait) but if you're bringing 10+, it starts getting difficult (and restaurants start having rules about not splitting checks, mandatory tips, etc). 

I'll expand on MelBurslan's comment. I'm answering this from the perspective of a full-time freelancer/consultant who used to work in the corporate world. If you were not an employee of this company, you are an independent worker (with or without a contract, though ideally with one). You can just put self-employed in that case and not say which periods you were actually working for this client. It is common for freelancers or consultants to put who their client list includes. This is generally acceptable in the world of freelancing because freelancing is inherently feast-or-famine. For example, I know of an independent web designer who I read is considered one of the best web designers in the world; he said even he goes through periods where he has no work. This is generally more credible if you see your freelance work as a business and have a business structure for it. This could be a corporation (probably overkill if it's just you), LLC or equivalent, or even a sole proprietorship which has a name. For example, I own an LLC for my consulting business. In the work I do, there are sometimes some stages of a project where a client doesn't need very much (or even any) of my time. I'm not "not working" during those periods, because I just use the time that I am waiting for the next stage of a project (where I am needed again) to build my business and work on side projects. (Edit: and I still have that client even if we're currently working 0 hours a week together.) So my résumé lists that I have owned a consulting business this whole time and describes what I have been working on, both with my clients and on my business. Building a real-life business (even if it's only one person) and studying how to do that helps me bring more value to companies that I work with in the future because it allows me to understand more about how they operate. Some sources: 

Pragmatically, I chose the second option. It addressed my short-term annoyance with the cloth catching, and it hopefully will increase the time until the mechanism fully fails. The perfect solution would be the third option, but I'm not sure if I will even have the car that long. I can come up with many times where I've made similar trade-offs in my work: the perfect solution would take too long or cost too much money, so I came up with another solution which didn't address the full need but was worthwhile because it would address some or most of the problem, and I could do it in a reasonable amount of time or because its cost was within our budget. Also, there are times when you can break down a perfect solution into the solution for now which is part of the perfect solution and addresses the immediate need, and you can later work towards implementing the perfect solution when there is more money, time, or other factor that currently limits you from implementing the perfect solution now. This is important for an employer to know because it tells them a few things. It helps them understand your problem-solving ability. It also helps them understand how you work with constraints. The question also gives them examples of real-world situations where you have identified the portion of the problem that is most important to solve (or the portion of the perfect solution that doesn't work for your situation due to cost, time, or other factors) and addressed it. Being able to talk about this means that you can talk about what you've completed and what trade-offs you made to get it done. There are many people who get caught in delivering the perfect solution, which ultimately results in never being done. 

It's only worth it to keep persistently following up if a) they will pay you and b) they are a dream client for you. But in any case, what you're currently doing is probably not getting heard. Edit: Since they are local, you can also try what Rolazaro suggested and stop by. You aren't likely to get a meeting immediately and might not even see the person you are trying to contact, but it may get them closer to making a decision one way or the other. 

You can send them one last email that says that it is your last email to them. I'd recommend doing this because this is a no-budget project. You can try contacting this lead again in a few months. 

For this question, let's assume I needed to send an important email to a potential customer. Because of a problem with my email client, which rarely happens, two copies of the email are in my Sent folder (both there and on my webmail client). It looks like the message has sent twice, although I'm not 100% sure about that because I can't see the recipient's inbox. I am wondering if I need to send another email to apologize for this or if that would just be adding more noise to this person's inbox. Is there a business/workplace etiquette convention for this? 

I think this is strongly dependent on the specific company's culture, what your plans are when bringing the family in, and how often you bring them in. Going based on the fact that this seems to be an uncommon occurrence at your office and not a normal thing, I have the following advice: If you want to bring your family in once just to show them around the office, let them see what you do and where you do it, maybe introduce a few of your coworkers that you work closely with or w/e then it's likely alright. The key is to not disrupt your coworkers if they're clearly busy and to not do this often (once is alright, every few months is cutting it close, more often is probably a bad idea). Make sure that your children stay close and are respectful (don't bring kids who run around wildly or have trouble keeping quiet). I'd aim for doing this around lunch time or the end of the day, when people tend to be winding their work to take a break anyway so that any disruption you cause is minimal. You might also mention it in advance to your coworkers who might be disrupted by the visit (ask them if it'd be alright for your family to drop by on Wednesday around lunch). I'd also probably ask your superior if it's acceptable for a short visit just to show your family where you work (they'll likely give you an ok, but if they say no, then obviously don't bring them). For the visit itself, keep it short and simple. Show them your office/desk, maybe introduce them to a couple coworkers if they aren't busy or take the initiative to do so themselves, show them some key locations in the office if applicable. Do NOT interrupt active meetings, people on the phone, or people who are clearly hard at work. Try to keep things short and don't spend a lot of time where your presence might distract others or prevent work from getting done. Aim for 15 minutes or less of time where you aren't behind closed doors in your own office. 

An extremely timely answer was posted today to a LinkedIn blog written by Steve Sinofsky, who was President of the Windows division at Microsoft until a few months ago, titled Benefitting from skip-level 1:1s - tips and pitfalls. About half of it is for managers conducting the meeting. Don't skip this: read through it so that you can get a sense for what your manager's manager's goals in doing this 1:1 with you might be. The other half of the blog post is for you as the individual contributor who's going to this meeting, and there's a lot of wisdom in there, starting with this: 

I've got a co-worker who does that! This co-worker predates me at the company. I agree with you about not CCing people who aren't involved and don't need more mail filling their inbox with details they don't need, I wasn't sure why it was being done. During one of my 1:1 meetings with my manager, I asked these questions:
