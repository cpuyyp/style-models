One could point out that you are presenting a logical argument, i.e. evidence, to prove that there is no such thing as proof. You create a paradox: If your argument is valid, there is no such thing as "proof", so any claim that you have proven your point is inherently self-contradictory. :-) But that said ... A classic philosophical musing is to ask, "What can we know for certain?" Of course we can quickly dismiss "I read it in a book" or "My teacher told me" as proof: Maybe the book or the teacher is mistaken or lying. You say you saw it with your own eyes? But we have all seen optical illusions. How do you know that what you saw in this case was real and not an illusion? You have a rigorous logical argument that proves it true? But how can you be sure that there is no flaw in your logic? We have all seen others duped by flawed arguments. Maybe you can even recall a case where you were convinced by a logical argument yourself but later concluded that the argument was wrong. What makes you think that your logic is infallible? Etc. Thomas Aquinas once argued that he is confidant that he, himself exists. After all, he said, I may be deceived about many things. But I can't be deceived about my own existence, because in order to be deceived, I must exist. But beyond that ... In real life, we all have some things that we would say we are 99+% sure of. I'm quite sure that gravity exists, and that 2+2=4, for example. But how sure am I that the planet Neptune exists? Or that the cosine of 30 degrees = 1/2? I'd put them pretty high, but I'd be a little more tentative. I've seen pictures of Neptune on TV ... but then I've seen pictures of the planet Tatooine on TV too. I've probably seen a proof of the cosine of 30 somewhere, but I don't remember it. To come down many steps: I doubt that bigfoot exists. But I wouldn't bet my life savings on it. Etc. My point being, Can we really say that we have ABSOLUTE, 100% proof of anything? Any such argument must ultimately rest on philosophical beliefs about the nature of reality, and about logical arguments, and I think that any intelligent, honest person would have to admit that he can't be 100% certain of these things. So I conclude that it's not a simple yes/no question, the point is proven or it is not. It's a matter of, just how convincing is the proof? 50%? 80%? 90%? Our courts routinely talk about "levels of proof". The highest standard is "proof beyond a reasonable doubt". That's the standard used in criminal cases. The idea is that, yeah, someone could always bring up some unanswered question, so there's always some room for doubt. As one lawyer put it, "It's POSSIBLE that invisible Martians suddenly appeared in the locked room, killed the victim, shoved the bloody murder weapon into the hands of the defendant, and then disappeared just as the police broke down the door. But probably not." At the other extreme is "preponderance of evidence". This is the standard used in civil suits, and it means "which side was more convincing". If you think there's a 51% chance that side A was in the right, then you must rule in favor of side A, even though you believe it is very very close. We all apply such standards all the time -- not so rigorously named, but the same idea. Before I buy a house I make very sure that I know what I am buying, that all the paperwork is done correctly, etc -- and then I buy insurance just in case I'm wrong. I go to nowhere near as much work before buying a box of cookies. If a friend said they tasted good, I may risk a couple of dollars and buy them. If they turn out to taste awful, so I throw them away. I haven't lost much, so I don't need to spend weeks studying the question. Etc. 

Lies are a violation of most ethical systems. Usually statistics in books and the media are rarely fabricated (b), but very frequently they are out of context (a). This becomes very deadly when used as a premise to justify conclusions which would be an egregious premeditated lie with a false justification. Many authors and media commentators state a ton of facts to build a case and then jump to a conclusion without making any necessary links between the truck load of raw data that is taken out of context and the idea they are trying to promote. Plato talks about the Noble Lie. In essence his contention is that during a debate or similar circumstance you could perform a calculated lie in which your opponent in trying to dispute it would unravel the false basis of their position. I personally believe this was along the lines of agreeing with an opposing irrational view, and encourage taking the idea to the extreme. Manipulation The second ethical violation could be to purposely mislead people via Moving the Conversation to a red herring (reference). While not a direct lie, it can be seen as unethical to redirect the conversation purposely off track to avoid admission of the truth. Politicians frequently do this in debates, and a simple example could be as simple as citing a number of outlier events consuming the majority of the talk time, and claiming victory when not all of them are rebutted. This falls primary into the realm of intellectual dishonesty although many ethical systems may see this as unethical. Noble Lies An example of a Noble Lie could be(1): 

I would like to draw attention to writings of Rene Descartes. This is from Part II of his Principles of Philosophy (Kluwer, 1982) 

(3) seems to contradict (2). Perhaps, there are some holes in these reasonings, but I am pretty sure that this oracle machine is impossible. 

Surely, now we do not consider such proofs as proofs. However, it reveals some truth. If one conceives two independent substances, she should accept that they would interact. An interaction would demand a common ground, therefore it will undermine the independence and a monism becomes inevitable. One can point to Christian God - he can influence without being influenced, but one can argue that this construction is too abstarct or too artificial. 

This is not a commentary or valuation on which is better, but the observed "preference" for the two movements. Please correct me if you feel that I am being unfair or accidentally oversaw something. Classic Liberalism A little history: Mentioned by Greek Philosophers, although it is much older, the Classical Trivium was a secular method of learning from ancient Greece. It consisted of 7 principles, the first 3 called the Trivium, the final 4 the Quadrivium: 

This leads to Solipsism aka. how do you not know we are brains in a jar. From a pragmatic perspective this epistemology is unproductive since it doesn't get us anywhere. Some philosophers still regress to this state today. Although taking the questioning back this far is 'ok' as a thought experiment, living with this notion as being correct or using it as a defense against a claim or argument is intellectually dishonest since if they believe they are a brain in a jar they should not be participating in the discussion at all. Solipsism can be debunked as begging the question or being unfalsifible depending on the specific variation and the opponents epistemology. 

There is some difficulty with the idea "the Universe=computer". This computer can do one step from one state to another, but why should the machine make such a step at all? Why she does not stick forever at one state? The logical schema is inherently static; it cannot say anything about the time and the change. For any particular computer the problem of change does not matter - this computer is realized somewhere as a physical entity, so nobody care of where the change comes from. In the case when the Universe is declared to work as a computer and nothing more, this problem starts to be too serious and it cannot be ignored. Apparently, the computer model being blind towards the time implies - there is something beyond its scope; this "something" pushes the world to change in time, some phenomena start to be, and others disappear. In other words - the model is incomplete. For my opinion, this kind of universal Pythagorean project should fail (as all other kinds, probably). 

The logic is impeccable. If it is true that all members of group X have characteristic Y, and if X1 is a member of group X, than X1 must have characteristic Y. The flaw is that it is not true that all bald men are master criminals. Example 2: 

Here the premises are all true. Lex Luthor really is bald, and Lex Luthor really is a master criminal. But the logic is flawed. Just because one member of group X has characteristic Y doesn't mean that all members of group X have characteristic Y. Of course sometimes a conclusion will be true even though the argument does not prove it. Maybe Fred really is a master criminal. But that's essentially a coincidence. 

One can say, that they are merely extremities, limiting cases, abstractions, and, indeed, Bergson prefers to speak about infinite number of degrees between them (for example, living beings), that fill the world. He had even speculated that 

The imperative directs somebody to the universal moral system. The GR keeps her within her individual feelings, desires, fears, perceptions, stereotypes. GR looks as something general but it is empty - these are its applications that matter, and they are mostly subjective. This is just my answer - I am not sure that Kant's reasoning is similar. 

I do not think that Descartes was the first who had been advancing the idea of locality in his time; probably, the concept was already in the air. However, he develops it quite systematically. 

The answer is Yes. To list a few: Evidentialism or some form of it such as Pragmatic Evidentialism is my go to. Evidentialism in a nut shell requires evidence for all claims. Pragmatic Evidentialism deals with the infinite regress by requiring evidence to a reasonable level based on the size of the claim, etc.. I belive this is the newest of the ones I am listing here. $URL$ Objectivism comes from Ayn Rand who has a different take on reality based Epistemology. $URL$ Materialism is notion that all that exists is matter and its movements and modifications. This one is the grand father of objectivism and evidentialism. 

It's difficult. Most philosophy courses teach the History of philosophy instead of just what the basic fundamentals are and what leading ideas are. Classes that follow people instead of ideas tend to be a waste of time. In a nutshell you have: 

One can say that the dualism of Bergson is not a Cartesian clear-cut dualism, it is something more nuanced - according to his views, the whole world is "made from the same stuff". This, probably, could open a way to a physiclism. However, Bergson was strongly opposed to any attempt to reduce mental phenomena to material movements. That opposition he had justified in various ways. Perhaps, it can be demonstrated basing on the very special and decisive role that the time plays in his philosophy. First, he states 

I think that the answer is "no, it's impossible". However, probably, all perception of the problem and its goals will change, so it could be changed to "yes". Women succeed in procreation of creative agents, why do not programmers?
