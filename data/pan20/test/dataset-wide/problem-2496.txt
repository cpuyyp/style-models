depends on the way. In giving a talk, there is no problem. Harming a ghost, or doing healing others then by giving Dhamma might be failing.

Those common views, that "non-violent" agression and actions of politic and "manipulation", yet most for an opinion, one side, and in opposition, are merely a notion of secular approaches and in Mahayana spheres often accepted "doing evil for a good", which is common tolerated by normal people, given the titel "hero" to one taking side. There are NO of such "heros" who had not caused a mass on suffering, and if we think on what Maha-Atmas approach caused on wars and death in the following, to what has been giving rise to ripe, it's merely the observation of blind to gratify such as good. Virtue which is not based on right view can not be real virtue but falls for the most into the frame of just another hypocrisy. So in this regard it's possible better (althought aggressive as well) to listen more on such as Oshos statements on heros, like Ghandi (not, it's merely vulgar speech or better provoking) As for the Buddha and his Dhamma, uprooting the flag, the potence, as well as giving up holding to being, becoming and birth (and its effect death) clearly contradicts not only the words but also the conduct of what ever might cover himself with non-violence, yet still on a fight and after win in the world and outwardly. In somehow it seems in this way merely like a selfreflection, this quote, by him. Opposing ones leader, father and mother, contemplatives, disrespect toward them, even if covert in "non-violence", leads to violence and to the other extrem on the same coin. The Pema, love-sutta might explain it well. It shows the four kind of tools to win fools in politic in detail: 

All relationships are subject to impermanence, just like all illusions. Also, the way you perceive a relationship, will always differ to the other person within that particular relationship. The relationship is merely 'true' only within your perception, which is also impermanent, just like an illusion. 

To teach mindfulness is one thing; To teach the dharma is another thing. Supplementing my original comment to the question and simply put: If the corporation is unethical, anything/any means that supports this corporation, is unethical. 

In simple terms: Precepts = refraining from actions. My understanding is that the 5 Precepts not only helps us from creating negative karma (Kamma = intention + actions) but also helps us in cultivating a foundation to release our attachment to the 5 Skandhas. (Actions being external factors of attachments.) To your question: [My question is how fair or correct to narrow third precept to sexual misconduct or adultery?] <--- I do not see any bits of "unfair" or "incorrectness" to limit sexual misconduct to the third precept. No matter in Theravada or Mahayana, they have given numerous examples and conditions on what is considered as Sexual Misconduct and inappropriate actions. And the range of stuff is very wide. [Does over-thinking violate third precept because its a misconduct of mind due to uncontrollable and misuse mind?] <--- No. The 5 precepts corresponds to actions only. Over-thinking is addressed through training the mind. A method of training one's mind is to observe how they arise from the 3 poisons: Greed, Hate, Ignorance, and then apply respective antidotes (Generosity, Loving-kindness, and Wisdom). This training is obviously the core teachings of the Buddha, i.e. the 4 noble truths and 8 folds paths. 

There have been mentions in the text where even Once-returner could not continue ordinary life as usual and starved. My person remembers a young daughter, on hearing the Dhamma been taught, for example. One may ask: "How comes that one is in such situation?" Well, it might be the case that there was not much support and nurishment to have the required Upanissaya (strong condition) to have the "luck" being next to the opportunity to go forth. And one might remember that giving food, is the cause of long life. Outwardly conditions (like food, weather/climate, person/association, dwelling/location) are a matter of upanissayapaccaya, strong condition causes. Having given causes, effects are met. This to is why wise or faithful lay practing people never fail to invest into a good future, even if not seeing such requirement of the need to have the opportunities to lead the holy life, and give the causes that the/a good Sangha of Bhikkhus is near to them and good maintained.

It was never about blind belief. It is about faith in the direction of the path. By the time you reach the path's end, faith is not required, because you already know. Without faith or belief, you would be on your foot, forever questioning about your own belief, without taking one step for eternity. 

Buddhism views suffering as coming from 8 different forms, as below: Suffering of birth; Suffering of old age, Suffering of sickness, Suffering of death, Suffering of getting what you don't want, Suffering of not getting what you want, Suffering of getting what you want while not being able to hold onto it forever, and then there is the most mysterious one of all, which is all pervasive suffering or misery. Therefore, in mainstream Buddhism, it is widely accepted that "Suffering is inevitable" so long as your are still in the wheel of re-incarnation. (Un-enlightened). The core of Buddhism teaches about treating suffering (4 noble truths) through enlightenment (8-folds path). Hence, from the above list, there was no further dissection of pain vs suffering, because that would be redundant and further complicate matters. In comparison, it seems DBT basically replaced the word "Suffering" from Buddhism's context, with the word "Pain" in DBT's context. Not saying DBT is less comprehensive, after all it is a researched therapy with Buddhism flavors. I believe it's probably more useful and easier to be accepted to treat those people with different conventional/religious backgrounds. Always be mindful that - Suffering and pleasure are two sides of the same coin. 

Giving blessings and Anumodana is not only practicing metta and mudita, but also allowed by the Buddha

Since the questioner asked for "seeing here and now the truth", even he him self might be not capable, again to be seen by the wise: 

At this point your refuge grows firm and no more to slight far away. Nature, by given the cause for it, is now on your conductive side. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial use or other lower wordily gains by ways of exchange or trade] 

Wisdom, here especially what is called "emotional-wisdom" is not a matter of age and is always up to ones persons previous and current deeds. As the Buddha told, some might have an easy way, some a hard. It's totally not a matter of age in regard od dealing with feeling, and the younger one is learning skills, the better, for an old is hard to bend. There have always been kids who even gained Arahat shipp and that even old are foolish till their death is a common usuall. So better than to worry about the young would be worry about ones emotional problems in regard of young and uproot the cause of emotional problems with if by one self, wouldn't it? As soon being able to chase off cows, one is already prepared to even live the holly life in its full, from outwardly aspects.

Your Karma, good or bad, will depend on how you treat, raise, and teach your child. It is What you do with him/her, that will result in good/bad/neutral karma. Hence, by just bringing a child into the world, it is neither a good or bad karma, it is neutral. 

It might be a cultural thing; But we should all stop trying to please the whole world and start to action what is practically good and with good intentions. Follow the dharma and action without fears. Think about it, is it justified to do bad deeds just because somebody threatens you to? 

Dreams are fragmentation/de-fragmentation of your memories. Memories are based on a combination of your worldly senses from eyes , ears , nose ,tongue, body , mind....etc. 

In Buddhism there are concepts that are so complex that transcends beyond common reasonable, objective thinking. Therefore to your question, the answer is obviously "No". The question instead should be: Does common 'reasonable and objective' thinking downplay the depths of true Buddhism teachings? This will eventually guide you through your doubts. 

What do you think: can Dhamma be realiced by animals? Easy or nearly to no way for humans having gained an animal state? Visible right here and now. 

Given the good hint of Dhammadathu: "psychiatric hospital", if using a retreat, the Buddhas teaching, just to funcion for the world, e.g. as a compensation, not really up to go beyoung, it's nothing but missuse of gifts. It's not good, not adviced, to get torward a an unexcelled gift with the inspiration of function for the world. As Psychiatrist Lanka might know how the matter of reintegration and earnings with such works. Having this basic fear possible change to a better, it would be nothing but hindrence to gain right view but as often a door to develop strange wrong views, willing to use high Dhamma for the world. This often "schizophrenic" way of live that is further leaded, a broad visible phenomena of so called Vipassana doer, is for the most not of benefit and those people are usually very unvirtuose, not ashamed to perform even grave missconduct, often continue wrong livelihood, having developed such as householder equanimity, a equanimity not based on penetrating the world, e.g. sensuality, matter. So my person advice is to simply lead a proper lay-persons life, focusing much on generosity, service for worthy and Sila and when the day comes that actually seeing the danger in the world, taking on the going forth if the conditions outwardly, previous cased, are avaliable. Todau even monks make retreats in same way... look at them. Today a very open remark of a, to that extend, very wise nun. Accidentally from the same lineage (if my person is not wrong) as it seems: A silly Nun, she calls her self, sadly. Here a share of the (hidden) comments on the "luck" of reintegration, her resume:
