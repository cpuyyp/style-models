Each new star we find is generally considered to be part of the constellation it is nearest to. Our Sun is obviously a star, just much closer. Is our Sun part of any constellation? If so, which constellation is it a part of? 

(Yes I'm excluding Pluto from this the same way it was excluded for not being a planet) Observing the planets orbit of the Sun they all seem relatively planar and roughly all orbit along the same plane. Is this due to the way that our Solar system was formed or is this a physical phenomena observed in other systems? 

Why do some planets have rings? How are they made and from what? Most importantly, will I be able to observe the rings on any planet with an amateur telescope? 

Sometimes at night you will look up to the stars and they will appear to twinkle, getting brighter and darker in bursts. 

A good way to show how this is achieved is to show you a case study, below I will detail how we came to make the theory that Mercury has a liquid core. It is first important to note that we are never definite of the properties but we are able to use the data to infer and create a theory that we believe to be an accurate representation of the truth. 

The MESSENGER spacecraft was launched for the purpose of analyzing MErcuries Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (hence MESSENGER). Messenger had a number of pieces of equipment on board to allow it to conduct it's experiments, as detailed in the below image: 

Here on Earth we get to experience lunar and solar eclipses. Is this pure coincidence that everything happens to line up? Do other planets in the solar system experience this phenomenon or is this something unique on Earth? 

Why is the moon moving further away from the Earth? Is this a result of the moons formation that set it in motion to spiral away from us? Or is this a resultant force of the gravity from the Sun and other large bodies? 

Using this technology one can build up a 3D visualization of a planets surface What scientists discovered from this mapping is that: 

There are currently three classifications of black hole and these are stellar, super massive and miniature. Stellar Stellar black holes are formed by a massive star collapsing and its mass being great enough to form a black hole of moderate size Super-massive These black holes can have the mass equivalent of a billion suns, these most likely exist at the centre of galaxies and are probably as old as time itself. Miniature Miniature black holes are theoretical and are thought to have been created at the early stages of the universe. these require masses less than that of our sun and are thus very unlikely. Other "But Rhys" I hear you cry, "these are all from stars you fool!" And yes, yes they are, this is because black holes are formed from mass, and lots of mass (except miniatures), coincidentally large amounts of mass tends to gravitate towards each other and form stars long before it forms black holes. Therefore theoretically, a black hole does not even need stars, it just needs lots and lots of mass, but having that much mass without forming a star is no easy task. Short answer, you can make a black hole from anything as long as it has enough mass, but good luck stopping this from forming a star beforehand! 

telescope.com has a quick paragraph on astronomy. Below I summarise the important points with a few of my own suggestions thrown in. Dark & dirty places Set up on grass or dirt, pavements and buildings radiate the heat again at night and the air flow created by this can distort your image. If possible you might be able to make use of a public park. Failing the above you might be better off going to the outskirts of the city and finding a nice dark hill and avoid as much of the light pollution as possible, but obviously this depends on your situation. Telescope This doesn't require a special telescope, you should be able to manage just fine with what your budget allows for. Though a computerised mount can aid you plenty in locating objects, as you have fewer stars to use as way-points in light polluted areas. Here is an example I found earlier - yes they are quite pricey. 

How did they come to this conclusion? This paper explains in depth.

According to this geology site Earth's core is predominantly iron and nickel. and this space site says that Earth's mantle is predominantly silicates So the internal similarities so far is that they both possess iron cores and silicate rock mantles. However the core of Europa is mixed with sulphur rather than Earth's nickel. Another similarity between Europa and Earth could be the composition of the oceans. NASA speculates that Europa's oceans are also briny with salts and minerals dissolved in it. This is mostly theorised due to what we know about planet formation. However this also comes with many differences, the Galileo spacecraft did not detect a magnetic field from Europa, which leads to speculation that, whilst Europa may have an Iron compound core, it is probable not molten any more. Conclusion Interior Similarities: 

Some celestial objects seem to be referred to as asteroids, some as comets, and some as meteors or meteorites. What is the distinction between all of these different objects? Are any of them the same? 

E classifications are elliptical. S classifications are spiral. Therefore if we extrapolate the pattern and theories it could potentially be said that in the course of a galaxies life it will eventually become a spiral, orbiting a super massive black hole as more and more of its mass is drawn to the centre. Ok so if it can be theorised that most galaxies will eventually spiral a black hole it leads us to believe that the rotation of a galaxy will then be because of the rotational direction of a black hole, right? This NASA theorist says there may be such a thing as a backwards black hole, one that spins in the opposite direction to its accretion disks, which in this case I assume would be the galaxy. Looking at observations of galaxies leads to most of them, spinning with the arms trailing, but there are cases where the arms are facing the direction of the spin! Conclusion So Yes, we have observed the spin of galaxies, no, not every galaxy rotates, irregular galaxies have no central point of mass of which to rotate about. As for if they all spin in the same direction, that is extremely hard to observe without more data points and further study. 

Planets For a body to be classified as a planet it must have a few physical characteristics: Mass It must have enough mass to have a strong enough gravity to overcome electrostatic forces to bring it to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. Hydrostatic equilibrium is important because early in a planets life it is nearly entirely fluid, crust and all Internal Differentiation The life cycle of a planet essentially leads to denser heavier metals being at the centre of a planet, surrounded by a mantle which must at some point have been fluid (it can still be solid and called a planet as long as it used to be fluid.) Atmosphere This is usually driven by its mass but a planet should have an atmosphere. This means it should be massive enough to have a strong enough gravity to hold some gasses to its surface. More massive planets are capable of keeping lighter gasses, such as hydrogen, bound to them too. I.e Jupiter. Magnetosphere A magnetosphere suggests that the body is still geologically active. This means they have flows of elements that conduct electricity in their interiors. As specified by the IAU:
