It is very common to hear two- and three-year-olds in English saying "I falled down," "She gived me it," etc. And the frequency of a verb form is inversely related to the age at which one is likely to master it, indeed to the point where past tenses such as "lay" and "shone" are becoming archaic in most dialects of NA English. What does the journey of a child's acquisition of verb (or noun/adjective) forms look like in a heavily inflected language, such as 

"Human language" isn't really well-defined. It's easy enough to separate what is human language from what isn't, in most cases, in the present day, but the tools we've developed for that from our present-day experience probably aren't adequate to evaluate the situation, say, 300 000—40 000 years ago, or even describe it well. The burden then falls to the inquirer, what is it precisely are you wondering originated once or multiple times? What if there really was polygenesis of language, but those of the present day all come from a single source (assuming we could even define what we meant by that, and it wasn't silly)? If the last language not from the same source was, say, some North American language isolate that went extinct in the 18th century, after being sparsely documented? This leads to more interesting questions, such as what if, grammatically, it wasn't all that out-of-the-ordinary? 

In Finnish, tai is inclusive, vai exclusive, and eli is for an equivalence. E.g. Haluaisitko omenia tai päärynöitä? "Would you like some apples or pears? Haluatko omenan, vai päärynän? "Do you want an apple, or a pear?" Se on hyvän- ja pahantiedon puun hedelmä, eli omena. "It's the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and bad, or an apple." 

"Genetic relatedness" of language isn't even really well-defined. It is entirely possible that throughout the past many millennia, languages had a tendency to borrow very differently than today. 

I'm looking in particular for an analysis of which categories start to be incorporated correctly at what age, and what children do beforehand to express the same ideas. (For example, do they speak an inflected language as if it were more agglutinative?) Even a narrative of one child's journey in learning the grammar would be most welcome. 

Direction words arise from the need to coordinate direction. Thus, their nature and usage can vary widely from one language to another. To start, here are a few aspects of a people and their land that can influence the form that direction words / direction morphemes end up taking: 

My bet is on another Turkic language, Uighur, especially if we use it to mean both modern Uighur and its ancestor Old Turkic, which was the official language of the Uighur Khaganate (begun in 742) and later the predominant language of Turfan / Turpan, East Turkestan (Xinjiang province, China), where Uighurs settled in 840 and have remained to the present day. According to the UCLA Language Materials Project, the earliest Uighur texts are written in three scripts: the Old Turkic runes (also called Orkhon-Yenisei runes), the Manichean script and the Uighur script. All three types probably ultimately go back to Aramaic script. (The Aramaic script derives from Phoenician, as do a plurality of the world's orthographies eventually.) 

My guess (heavily influenced by how Malayo-Polynesian languages tend to pronounce the alphabet) is we would end up getting /ka/, /ke/, /ki/, /nu/, /pe/, /pi/, /te/, or /ti/. Another question: For each length n, what is the most popular n-letter (in IPA) word? For n at least 4, I have no idea what one could do short of crawling a massive database. Edit: Just noticed that we're supposed to exclude universal loanwords, so I'll rework my answer soon or take it down. 

Piotr Gąsiorowski has very recently put forth a hypothesis on the origin of Indo-European kwetwor "four." 'Four: A Map' He argues that it comes from an archaic word for "pair" or "to pair." The semantic evidence is good; unfortunately, there are not many branches with a non-"four" reflex of kwet in them. 

I think it's interesting enough to try to lay out a method that one might use to try to answer this question, and I think the question is more interesting as one about words written in a basic / lossy IPA (such as how we tended to use Kirshenbaum on Usenet) rather than the languages' respective orthographies. If I had the relevant tools available, I'd try this: 

in other words, (1) Greenberg and Ruhlen are correct that Na-Dené and Yeniseian are relatives, (2) Ruhlen's wordlist is partially correct and helpful, but (3) Haida is not part of their linguistic unit, and (4) 75% of Ruhlen's correspondences turned out to be invalid. This is getting a little long, so I'll summarize the rest. After his Africa research, Greenberg traveled to Papua New Guinea and to South America (IIRC; if anyone can source this I'd be grateful) and collected Swadesh-type word lists from hundreds of tribes. This, too, is incredibly important research, of a nature not many have had the constitution to undertake. The results of it are, too, very important. What's the conclusion? More research of this sort needs to be done, to get a lower error rate on the words in the lists. Sound changes need to be added back into the equation with gusto, so that we can find more correct correspondences and throw out more of the ones that don't actually hold. And on those pronouns: they certainly do hint at the possibility of Eurasiatic (for instance) as a linguistic unit. But what if, again, there were an era where pronouns were the new hot item? Then they could all reduce to loanwords. Again, the conclusion is more research needs to be done. 

Some languages use non-compound words for the ordinal (secondary) directions. For example, Finnish (with help from Wiktionary and Finnish Wikipedia): 

this is a factual objection, which can easily be verified. Similarly, in A Siberian link with Na-Dene languages (which I feel is the most notable finding in linguistic taxonomy of the twenty-first century so far, but that's beside the point), we read 

The types of activities requiring coordination (migration, herding, hunting, fishing, gathering, farming, trade relations, war, etc.) The geographical features of the area (coastline, a central river, tributaries, woods, islands, steppe, mountains). The current state of inherited cultural knowledge about direction (including mythology; this may largely go back to (1) and (2) from prior states of the language). 

The systems that thus arise may be influenced to be similar to the common cardinal directions in English, or instead make the primary distinction "upstream" vs. "downstream," "inland" vs. "toward the coast," or "direction towards" vs. "away from a certain very distant landmark." Taken beyond that landmark, a person might not be as effective at communicating navigation. (Although, technically, the same thing can happen in English: explain which way to go from the North Pole!) In Orientation Systems of the North Pacific Rim by Michael Fortescue, a close examination of the orientation systems of Wakashan, Tsimshianic, Haida, Tlingit, Eyak, Athabaskan, Eskimo-Aleut, Tungusic, Nivkh, and Ainu leads to the enticing conclusion that by conceiving of a language's orientation system diachronically, looking at etymologies of direction words and inspecting any inherently paradoxical methods of expressing direction, we can evidence a hypothesis as to whether a language is relatively new to a region (say, having arried within the past 2000 years), as well as perhaps find out where they came from! For example, if people in a dialect continuum settle a turning peninsula, the meaning of a direction word at the source may be different from at the tip. Similarly, whereas most IE languages use the PIE root *aus- "to shine, dawn" for "east," the Latin word australis "south" may be from the same root. This is "perhaps is based on a false assumption about the orientation of the Italian peninsula, 'with shift through "southeast" explained by the diagonal position of the axis of Italy'...Or perhaps the connection is more ancient, and [directly] from PIE root *aus- 'to shine,' source of aurora, which also produces words for 'burning,' with reference to the 'hot' south wind that blows into Italy." OE To address your question about English (all quotations from the Online Etymology Dictionary, OE): 

But as long as we're speculating, my bet is that the real answer is a mixture of mono- and polygenesis: there were many periods when tribes maintained close contact with each other, borrowing heavily across the grammatical spectrum throughout a dialect continuum for centuries, and then underwent periods of individuation, due to geographical or cultural effects; during one of these periods, perhaps you would say one of these speech patterns would finally qualify for whatever formal definition you have of "language," and during the next period of mixture, maybe it was borrowed from more than it borrowed. But then, say, a thousand years later, a dialect half a continent away, to which only a small portion of those innovations filtered, innovated enough on its own to where you could call it a "language." This whole scenario is to bear out the point that what we really have is a mess. (I know I've employed a nonstandard usage of "dialect"; I just didn't want to use the word "language" above, for obvious reasons.) Some references: Polygenesis, convergence, and entropy (1996), by Lutz Edzard, takes a comparable view In Language Polygenesis: A probabilistic model (1995), David Freedman and William Wang point out the flaws in the usual probabilistic argument for monogenesis Addendum: (let me know if I should create another question or something): An article in the New York Times, World's Farmers Sowed Languages as Well as Seeds (2003), bears out the relationship between the success of the comparative method and the presence of agriculture in the cultures being studied. (This relates to my point about dialect continua/grammatical innovation/"membranes" and leads into a response to MatthewMartin's answer.) +1 to MatthewMartin for mentioning a vital element of the "debate" Otavio Macedo was referring to. Greenberg conducted some of the most groundbreaking and notable research in linguistic taxonomy of the past hundred years, including but by no means limited to the establishment of Niger-Kordofanian and Afro-Asiatic. There always seems to be a lot of unhelpful, not-so-under-the-surface vitriol in many reactions to the Greenberg/Ruhlen research. On the other hand, when in the Amazon review of Ruhlen's book, Larry Trask says 

I am reasonably certain that in all of Finnic, and I think in Hungarian, plural is marked in all cases. (Another interesting feature of Uralic languages in comparison with Indo-European languages is lack of adjective case, i.e., concord, and Finnic and I think Hungarian buck the trend here too.) It seems that in Mordva there is an indefinite and definite declension, corresponding to what in English we would mark with the articles "a(n)/Ø" vs. "the"; in the indefinite declension, number is only marked in the nominative. The idea of pluralization in Mari seems to be complex: possessive plurals are often used to pluralize a noun, there are various dedicated plural markers, and sometimes simply the plural verb form suffices; beyond this, context often seems to be enough. The following information is from The Uralic Languages, edited by Daniel Abondolo, which I highly recommend, especially if you also want to find out what the situation is with the plural in Sámi, Permian, Khanty and Mansi, and Samoyedic.

I'm not sure there really even is a "current state of the debate." Most linguists seem to view it as a question that we don't have appropriate models or analyses to address. To start, I would like to bring up some finer points: 

Looking at modern French in light of vulgar Latin, or Chinese compared with Proto-Sino-Tibetan (if that can even be reconstructed), there seems to be quite a few contexts in which phonemes are subsumed, vowels are nasalized to indicate the loss of a nasal, or tones are introduced to retain distinctions formerly maintained by distinct consonant clusters. Modern Celtic languages certainly seem to have done a lot of this too, and I have heard that a similar thing happened in Sumerian. I was wondering if anyone has any theories or reference to theories about (1) What makes a language "prepared" for such a phenomenon to occur (e.g., are there some languages that this would be much less likely to happen to?) (2) Whether there are any aspects of a culture speaking a language that make people more likely to gravitate towards doing something like this across whatever number of generations. (I would also be interested in hearing whether anyone believes there was the strong presence of a Celtic substratum in French that influenced it in this way, but that's kind of tangential.)
