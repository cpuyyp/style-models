To be an opposite of the other, both words must come in the same line of thought. Then only we can imagine that they are completely on either side of a particular point on that line of thought and treat them as opposites. Often they must have a relation to our usual experience. The axis as the particular point, the two words must have a balancing effect. Actually, the particular word for creating a line of thought is the word for making the two words in the same category. 

Wise people never do anything without thinking twice; especially before sacrificing their life. If a few people in a country died for others just for increasing others' lifespan, would it be good to the country if their (other people's) aim is just enjoying themselves exploiting the natural resources? Do you think the ruler would be the same person always? Don't you know that it will take 'no time' to change the complete scenario? Can't you think that the power that controls the whole universe in micro and macro-level, can solve the problem you stated? 

Of course...music can do wonders. It can convey some strong emotions like ecstasy...but not all. In some occasions it is the best art form in conveying emotions. ( Though you have excluded films and TV as they combine base art forms) You can use them (films/TV) without combining with any sound. I mean, it can often convey many emotions especially when the feeling is strong even if it is in mute mode. You might have seen such video clips that have no mixed sound at all. If you wish to exclude that also, you will have to depend on literary art, especially when the emotions tend to become subtle. Since I don't know all the art forms I can't say anything about them. But for analysis, this three is more than enough. Though there is nothing tantamount to music in conveying ecstasy, it is insufficient to convey many other emotions. Now you can also reach a conclusion. Conclusion: We cannot choose the best art form at conveying emotions. 

The consciousness that coordinates and make all of us feel this as a world (as by mass hypnotism), will maintain the truth of levels; but not as levels of being (See, I didn't use the term absolute truth). If you don't like the term--' mass hypnotism' you may say 'because of our ignorance'. But a coordination is certainly happening. When you use the word 'being', the question becomes so precise that we can't say 'yes'. I compared the thing, sense organs and the different views (you mentioned as different levels of truth) to white light, prism and spectrum behind it (respectively). When you withdraw the white-light, the spectrum disappears. This implies, (just for comparison) white-light if it is taken as the real being, it can make the spectrum a mere nothingness. That means, here the spectrum has no separate beingness exempting the white-light. Therefore we can say that usage--'being' is in appropriate here. 

If the three men know one another and if they are sitting or standing together at one place, the tourist can identify them with one question to all the three men. (But here I can't consider good manners.) 

In the minutest level everyone's world or the 'world' created by everyone's mind is different. That is why we can't understand others fully. So, it is an approximation. 

The 50% marks the student was given was for his good performance though he did a trifle mistake. If he were allowed more time to verify the answer, he would have solved the problem correctly. The marks given was not for the half truth; but for his performance. That student knows the steps by step procedure correctly that was to be evaluated. So he deserves marks. But how many?...It depends on the examination/examiner (or the authority). What exist permanently is the Absolute Truth. It is the only truth. But facts exist for a certain period. Sometimes only for a short period. Sometimes for a long period or for a very long period. For convention we call some facts, truths. It is essential in our daily life. Otherwise so many complications/problems will arise. "The sun rises in the east." -- This statement is not actually true. But we must regard it as a true statement. If there is a grain of truth in something we say there is half truth in it, since we cannot (or we need not) quantify it. Most often half truths are focused for getting some advantages. Half truth may exist in the listener's/thinker's mind for some time...or for a long time; but, only in the mind. Like other statements (true or false) a half true statement also can influence the listener...sometimes for a short time, sometimes for the life time. It depends on the listener/thinker. 

Please note, non-dualism is not monism. Also, to realize it, a non-dualist must transcend intellectual level. And 'there', your atom, string etc have no meaning at all. When you say one, you treat all things as one and you as another. So to avoid this, non-dualists use this term -- non-dual. And the word 'become' also becomes meaningless when viewed from the highest level. Pure consciousness (it is one and undivided) is the only 'thing' that is immortal. All other names and forms are mortal. In Non-duality, basically (if it is the utmost base) there is no difference in you and I. The Bhagavad-Gita doesn't agree the idea of creation from nothingness. See: Chapter 2, Verse 16 

As in the case of atmospheric pressure, we are accustomed to the laws/rules/rights which are prevailing here before our birth. So, without any effort we believe that are not ours, as ours. (These cause sadness in the end.) We forget the truth that these things are not even half truths or truth-in-parts. So you need not make any efforts to accept these in parts. You unknowingly believe it. The effort is not for accepting them; but for rejecting. If you ask yourself whether this true, you will certainly understand the truth behind them. You may begin with asking about this device you are using now--"Is this device really mine?" 

In such cases we adapt some 'techniques'; but it depends on the objective of the assessment, the type of the assessment and the type of the prize. You can solve this problem simply by a tiebreaker. Or You can allow each individual to keep the prize for a specific period. Or You can divide the prize (if it is a cash prize). Or You can give the prize to the individual whose performance is good to the society. 

It depends on the gravity/rationality to be given in that particular circumstance. Sometimes we will have to accept parts as truth. E.g.: "Jack carried the load to the railway station on the horseback." See these two statements related to this matter. 1. Jack carried the load. 2. The horse carried the load. Actually the horse was carrying both Jack and the load. But the fare always goes only to Jack. Did we consider all the process here? Loading and unloading are the two parts we considered here. So, if there is a grain of truth/fact in the happening/matter we will be compelled to act accordingly (truth, sometimes in parts). But it depends on the circumstances. 

We can't say sugar is sweet or there is a taste called sweetness until we taste it. Others also won't agree with it unless they also taste it. Most people might even scold such people who talk about the sweetness of sugar. Likewise, "There is no fundamental truth. It's all belief"-- this (the last part) is a false belief. This last statement is not true in the case of the Ultimate truth. See the Bhagavad Gita 13.18 If these verses are true most of us must be in darkness. That is the reason for our such belief. 

Explanation is given in the link. When the delusion ends one can realize that beingness...that existence...as you reasoned that there must be a possibility. [It is incomparable. It is beyond reasoning.] 

If I take your words in literary sense I would say that it is not possible because if you say so you mean you need to wait for something to happen/become. Since you need not wait for a possibility, I am compelled to say so. Also, since consciousness is eternal, unchanging, present at all times, immutable, undivided, and infinite we need not use the word--'parts'. But if you consider the essence of that question only, again I say, "Of course"; but up to a certain extent only. This is because, if I said so it would be a denial of the words of great men who used the term 'non-dual' after realizing it. 

You can use this logic in the case of soul. A blind man will never believe the ability of eyes if very few people only had the power of vision. Even though a few people only had this ability, we call such people who believes it, superstitious. An experience of a 'thing' that is beyond sense organs and that transcends these organs may also be like this. Some people use the term -- 'soul' synonymously to denote consciousness, paramatma, jivatma etc. Those who didn't deny the word -- 'soul' to mention something that is immortal are considered as wise men; not as idiots. Also, without knowing the experience of energy and matter at the same time correctly, as you believe that "Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another.", you may believe this: "Soul is immortal." Even though this kind of an idea or thing seems as a blind faith (since you have no proof), many people have realized this truth. I am trying to point out only the biggest flaw in your definition: Have you thought about the main word you left out? When you used the term 'its action', you didn't consider that 'it' in your definition. I don't think you would get a (rational) definition that science agrees because science often needs proof that can be verified by perception through senses or by means of devices, equipments etc. And in the case of abstract ideas, by logical thinking/reasoning. But the greatest wonder is, our own body is the most suitable mean for that because 'real knowledge/experience' of soul is the knowledge of knowledge or the end of knowledge. But this is a rarely accepted fact/truth. Verify this also: 

In short, your life becomes miserable if you care only for scientific mind. You should care for others' feelings and values also if you wish to lead a good life. Since we give importance to feelings and values as well as scientific mind in our daily life, and they often come randomly, we can't differentiate the disadvantages of scientific mind very easily. If your scientific mind has granted you wisdom, your happiness and sadness would disappear. So in most occasions you wouldn't be behaving like others. Sometimes others might alienate you as a 'peculiar creature'. Your family members would also feel worry about you. I am saying this because real wisdom is beyond scientific mind, non-scientific mind, good, bad etc. 

They choose the easiest. Their beliefs may be not based on God. Read this strange prayer of a true devotee whose aim is something great. From the above hyperlink you might have noticed that the queen hadn't given up the strong faith in God. If the basic idea in the link is the truth, the main problem behind the change in attitude of the 'believers' must be the misconceptions about God. [Misconception is applicable to religious scholars also.] 

Even if so many changes are taking place in each of our body cells in every moment, when we say 'I' we often relate it to a changeless thing. And sometimes we feel that the 'I' is something 'beyond' all the bondages. You will get valuable information from the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. See this video also. 

To feel whether we or the world exists, I don't think a child born in this world needs to know about inductive logic or deductive logic. It doesn't wish to prove or even to say whether anything exists. It is because of our 'ignorance' we think so. Not they, actually we are ignorant. [They know that it is nonsense to say so using a mortal body :)] So there is no need to prove it. It is like an axiom in almost all persons' case. To say that something exists there must be a second thing. If the second thing is another form of the first and both of them have no permanent existence in this world, we can't even use the word 'exist'. But we should use it for our daily activities. The Ultimate Truth is beyond existence and nonexistence. So I can't find the significance of your question from another substratum.
