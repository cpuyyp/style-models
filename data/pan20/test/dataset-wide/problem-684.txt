The webpage for Chris King Hubs says they are easy to service. They supply lots of info sheets, like this hub exploded view, and manual. So I would take it apart and service it. They also sell parts, and since it's a high-end hub I would put some effort into saving it. 

PS The great Sheldon Brown's alter ego Carapace Completed Umber also wrote about Riding while pregnant. 

A possible (even likely) cause is a leaking valve. The simplest thing to do first is to see if blowing air out if the valve (by depressing the pin) solves the problem. You wouldn't see the dust if it was there; the only way to know is to inflate the tire and wait a few days. If that doesn't solve it, or you are less patient than that, go straight to the next step: remove the tire and tube. When removing the tire, use some chalk or some other means of knowing how it was mounted on the wheel (regarding the valve position and which is the drive side). With the tube, also take notice of which way around it is on the wheel. Now, if you find a hole in the tube you know where to look for the cause in the tire. Remove the tube and check for the leak by immersing the entire tube in a tub of water. Be patient, because the leak is slow. You could have pinched the tube when replacing it (common, but usually leaks faster). But more likely, you still have some glass in the tire. Line the tube up with the tire and check carefully. Patch the tube. But I really suspect the valve. From my limited experience with Schrader valves they a more prone to leak, especially if used without valve caps. Other possible causes are a foreign body onside the tire or something (eg a spoke) protruding from the rim. 

This is one of the most common questions from people new to racing. I notice user Rider_X has not responded (yet). If he does then it will be well worth reading. This anwser is drawn from my experience with intense weekly endurance competition (squash), people who race bikes (father, brother, a dozen regular riding buddies, including several at the elite level, and an Iron Man competitor), my own experience preparing for intense non-race events, and the articles listed below. Preparing for a weekly event the next evening starts 36 hours before, assuming you've done the training you need. There are four things to do the day before. 

The third example sounds more like your case. The other examples show how the local conditions and expectations can change things. 

Thanks, Criggie for bringing this back to the front of the queue. A quick Google for "Le vélo de Tati” shows that the largest online source is 1,722px × 2,048px (the first hit). This is accessible at $URL$ As Criggie has already cautioned, be careful of copyright issues. According to Cristies, the original was 9½ x 7in. (24.3 x 18cm.), so the resolution found would print OK. A poster print of double the linear dimensions should look OK also. The original doesn't look very sharp, so don't expect too much. 

If the cables are cheap ones, then the bends in the housing can cause friction and loss of efficiency. Perhaps that is what your LBS person meant. Check that the cables are routed correctly. If they are Ok, then find better quality cables (see that same Sheldon Brown page) and install them. 

Sorry I can't add an illustration from my phone :-) Tire clearance is the amount of air space between the tire and any other part of the bike (except the wheel of course). So yes, that includes the distance between the tire and fender / mud guard. The amount of clearance tells you how much larger you can make the tires, how much mud can accumulate before it impedes your riding, and how much tolerance the bike (especially the guard) has to flex. 

After @ChrisH's thorough answer (+1) I thought I'd give an experience report. When my kids were small, I used a general purpose touring frame for this job. It has more relaxed geometry than a road bike, mudguards (fenders), wider tires, and SPD pedals. It's also heavier, which is an advantage for this application. The child seat I used was similar to the one shown in the question. I found that we never did actually put the seat on my wife's bike. If the family is going for a ride together it turned out to be better to have it on the stronger rider's bike, and she could both keep up, and was able to ride beside the child and interact or check on him / her. If the seat has the ability to be tiled back then my advice is don't use it. The child's weight is already so far back on the bike that the extra tilt made the bike less stable and caused the front wheel to lift on steep hills. If that happens, of course you will just lean forward. When the kids were reaching the weight limit of the seat (18 kg IIRC) they were big enough to ride on a trailer-bike such as 

Fact or fiction? I have no idea. I can offer this experience from the last millennium: When using tubs (singles aka tubulars), they were a pain if they had a slow leak. The effort involved in repairing them never seems worthwhile while the tire is still semi-functional, so we would add a little milk along with the air when inflating it. It certainly worked, but I can only speculate on how it blocked the leak. I can report that any air that escaped smelled awful. Could the silicon grease idea work? Maybe. Test it, and report back. 

In an earlier version of this post I suggested Voltaren, recommended for me by my physio. I think that was unwise of me - you should obtain professional medical advice. Voltaren is an anti-inflammatory drug, available under prescription in the US. Some researchers warn against it's use. 

Another causes of such behaviour is a small puncture that only leaks at high pressure, or when the punctured part of the tire receives external pressure, such as when it is on the ground. Over the years I've had a few of these, one just a few weeks ago. On each wheel revolution the tire gave a hiss, until I stopped: ssst, ssst, ssst. When I stopped it seemed fine, just a bit flat. I took the tube out and pumped it up and couldn't hear any evidence of a leak. At home I had to inflate it like a balloon for it to blow bubbles under water. In another case there was a small shard of glass that only just protruded through the tire when I was inspecting it. In a third case the shard of glass was only visible when I turned the tire completely inside out. So they are caused by small objects embedded in the tire. My theory is that it is when 

Definitely replace it. At this stage, with the rubber delaminating from the case, it could come apart at any time. It's dangerous to use. Near the bottom of the picture there are some bare threads. It is at that point the tire should have been replaced and perhaps only used in an emergency. PS I see from the picture that the rim is quite worn. It's not far off needing replacement also. 

So cyclists are meant to be competing against each other, not each other's bikes. It's a fine line. If you want to read more, see UCI CYCLING REGULATIONS GENERAL ORGANISATION OF CYCLING AS A SPORT PART 1 GENERAL ORGANISATION OF CYCLING AS A SPORT (pdf). 

I suggest that you go to your local bike shop and see if you can test ride a modern bike. As Daniel says $500 will not get you far. A test ride of a couple of bikes at different price points will help you decide. You may find that your "retro" bike is OK after all. Or maybe that it never did fit you properly. But a new bike could be 5kg lighter than what you have! Now is a good time to do it, because it's Spring there and the shops will have a good range. If you decide to buy, then you can save for the next six months :-) 

On the day of the race, eat your normal breakfast and lunch. Unless you usually skip breakfast, in which case make breakfast normal. Two or three hours before the race, eat a light, low GI meal. One of the links below suggests 

There are three approaches you can use in combination. Preparation Tough tires - people have their favorite puncture-proof tires. Kevlar reinforced tires work pretty well. Hard tires - pump your tires to close to the maximum pressure written on the side wall. This definitely reduces punctures, and can be combined with puncture-proof tires. At the time You limit your question "reducing punctures while [riding] though glass". Obviously, if you could avoid the trash you would. You cannot always go around the trash. If you are able, you could bunny hop over it. This is also not always possible when commuting, due to lack of time, heavy traffic (including other bikes) limiting your options, or carrying a pack or panniers. Slowing down is often also not an option when commuting because of following traffic. After the fact Brush your tires. It should be acknowledged that there are some who are squeamish about this. But it is very effective at removing foreign objects from your tires. In 35 years since I learned to do it, I've never (seriously) hurt my hand. Of course you should wear gloves. Most gloves have a reinforced patch across the palm to the base of the thumb for this purpose. (Many people mistake this for extra padding :-) Don't wait: as soon as you hit the trash start brushing your tires. The more revolutions your tires do, the more the trash gets hammered into them. So brush them strait away. It doesn't help to stop to do it; firstly, it interrupts your ride, but mainly because by the time you stop the damage is done. For the front tire, place your palm (near the base of your thumb) gently on the top of the rotating tire, in front of the brakes. The tire surface must be moving away from anything you could catch your hand in. You only need to keep it there for a few seconds, enough for one or maybe two revolutions of the wheel. Sometimes you feel a slight bump when you have successfully removed something from the tire. Usually, you'll feel nothing. The back tire is a bit harder to brush, because you have to reach down to an awkward place and if you have to look it means you're not looking where you're going. So you'll want to practice this skill before you use it in traffic. Again, brush your tire in front of the brakes, in front of the back stay, where the tire is moving away from the brakes. Because of the low clearance between the back tire and the down tube on most race bikes, you need to be careful not to let you hand get pulled down into the gap. That hurts. Also avoid poking your finger into the spokes. That hurts too. After reading this you can see why some people avoid doing it. Just be careful while you are learning, and practice before doing it in traffic. It's a valuable skill to have.
