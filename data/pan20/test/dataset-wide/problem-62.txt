Nothing happens to him. You can get the same effect with a pistol firing blanks. For comparison higher grade air rifles can achieve supersonic velocities. as for knocking the person down, any gun that can do that will also knock down the person firing it. In fact the shockwave will risk collapsing the victim's lungs before it is strong enough to push them over. To knock them over you want slower moving air and a larger volume. something more like a huge potato gun. To know someone out with a shockwave is both very risky and very unpredictable. A blow strong enough to risk a knockout can just as easily kill. You are basically trying to give the person a concussion. several armies have researched vortex-guns and their conclusion it wouldn't work without making it excessively large and only works at very close range. You can see a PDF of the army report here. but the Wiki for a vortex gun will give more comprehensible information. 

its possible humans have a pretty symbiotic relationship with dogs. If anything being intelligent opens up new way to be symbiotic because you can anticipate behavior better and come up with creative solutions. being useful to humans is one of the most successful strategies out there, especially if you more useful alive than dead. A mobile home has all the benefits of a nomadic lifestyle without any of the drawbacks. The Isle of Wight is almost 150 sq miles. On something that size you can have full blown town with agriculture. The difficulty with getting on and off will create some natural defense as well. How much rain water they can collect will be the biggest limiting factor. No wells on a turtle. 

Its not a sonic boom, it is a shockwave. The big trick is that in a superclap the hands would not be exceeding the speed of sound, the air being expelled from between them does, creating a shockwave. If the hands were moving faster than the speed of sound then the boom could be produced by just waving one hand that fast. Just like a normal clap the sound/blast wave is being caused by expelled air, but in the super case the air being expelled exceeds the speed of sound producing a shockwave just like an explosion does. This means the hulk's (or insert fictional super) clap is not a sonic boom as much as it is a normal explosive shockwave. But you are going to need someone who is more familiar with the working equations for explosives and the human thresholds to calculate if it will damage a person. 

Consider instead the sun, moon, and space (spacing being drawn as stars since it is hard to draw nothing) gody/pure elements sun= heat/energy/(emotion?) moon = mass/matter/gravity Space = cold/entropy/(logic?) impure/mortal elements sun(heat) > space(cold) = lighting sun(heat) < space(cold)= wind Sun(heat) > moon(mass) = fire Sun(heat) < moon(mass) = sound moon(mass) > space(cold)= earth moon(mass) < space(cold)= ice The special one sun(heat) = space(cold) =moon(mass)= water/life This separates your big three while creating a more "pure" effect for the gods and it makes life special by balancing all the elements and thus requiring all the gods. You could even say the impure elements contain minute amounts of the third, or say they are not discrete separations but a triangular continuum, so they blur into each other at the edges. So for instance fire and sound are not completely distinct but points on a spectrum. Reasoning for each impure element is thus: sun(heat) > space(cold) = lighting, opposing forces with more energy = electricity sun(heat) < space(cold)= wind, opposing forces with less energy = wind Sun(heat) > moon(mass) = fire, heat from mass = burning = fire Sun(heat) < moon(mass) = sound, sound travels better at higher temperatures and even better at higher densities, also connects to explosions (shockwaves) the ultimate expression of mass, force, and energy. moon(mass) > space(cold)= earth, solid but still but more solid than cold = earth moon(mass) < space(cold)= ice, cold made solid = ice 

Size and/or armor Elephants and black rhino can't be taken down by anything but the largest predators (or people) and even then they kill far more often then they get killed. Usually the predator is exploiting a specific weakness like drowning or literally climbing the animal which a dog will not be able to do. You can basically include any animal in the elephant size range or bigger. A large sauropod (especially the heavily armored ones) would not even be threatened by the dogs, they would just be an annoyance to be stamped into paste. 

If you look at modern lizards for comparison then have about a 15-20 degree celsius temprature range they are active in, this is a bell curve so activity drops off on the ends. Now an intelligent species would be on the wider scale since they can apply technology. Now you have a bit of play in where this range sits, in colder adapted reptile it may start as low as 15 degrees, in warmer adapted ones temperatures up to 45 degrees are acceptable. So you have to ask yourself what kind of climate are my creatures adapted to cold or hot. You also have a small issue with the word "reptile", Crocodillians in general handle a wider range of temperatures than most other "reptiles". The term "reptile" can be applied to endothermic organisms, so you should decide if your creatures are actual ectotherms or not. 

binary fuels, much less chance of a stray bullet being fatal. if they are only being used for clean up, spray the napalm over the corpses then have a second soldier fire an incendiary. the limited range,fuel, and bulk of a flamethrower combined with the easy target effect is going to make mixed unit tactics more effective, so some with rifles and some with flamethrowers. 

Basically that's it. Hunger will exist and babies can't feed themselves so they need to be able to signal when they need to be fed. So you either need to have a way for the baby to feed itself or you need a different signal it can use you tell the mother it is hungry. Predator preferences won't do much becasue either human can fight the predators off consistently, in which case the cries are not detrimental enough to risk loosing and have offspring become malnourished, or they can't fight them off in which case they would not survive anyway. Humans are too big and obvious and have too much calorie demands to hide a large segment of the population without protection. 

Not directly There is nothing that can kill you directly that an autopsy could not find eventually, your best bet is to use something that is circumstantially deadly but would not look out of place: for instance salamander toxin in a hikers cookware. It just looks like a sad accident. Swapping prescription medication this works even better if they have risky meds, just switch the contents of the bottles around, lots of people die becasue they do this to themselves. Deathcap mushrooms mixed into the salad of a home gardener. That one kills a lot of people already. Mostly becasue the symptoms take days to set in, look like the flu at first, and the mushroom looks like the edible ones and tastes quite good. Lots of people fatally poison themselves all the time just pick an appropriate one. 

Birth control does not shrink the population, it stabilizes it by creating family planning. Because women become able to better choose when to reproduce you see a shift to fewer and thus high investment children. So you get less boom/bust population fluctuation. 

Aliens tend to resemble earth species because human are not very good at imagining something totally alien. Look at extinct organisms or less commonly known species and you start to see the range. organisms inherit a lot of baggage from their ancestors, our classification work for our planet's life becasue our planet's life is all connected and related which leaves identifiable patterns, those patterns do not need to be true of non earth life, certain patterns will likely be true to all life the ones not directly connected to ancestry. thing constrained by physics and chemistry would be common among all life, like how leverage works or energy intake vs output. but our classification will not apply well to life on other worlds. The phrase bounded but infinite comes to mind, there are constraints about how life works but within those "rules" there are a limitless number of variation most of which have probably not even been thought of. An example is skeletons, skeletons are helpful for increasing leverage and creating support, especially on land, but what you make them out of, whether they are inside or outside, or how they are laid out are all very flexible and vary wildly. Consider cartilage and bones, vs chitin, vs carbonate shells, vs echinoderm plates, vs wood in plants, those are all different ways of creating skeletons. You can have real fun by imagining better laid out organisms than earth life, like animals with one way breathing instead of dead end lungs, or brains that are attached to the skull at more than one point.
