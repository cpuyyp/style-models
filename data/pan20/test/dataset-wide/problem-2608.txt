This is an altar maintenance question. What are the sort of typical things done with the food, water, flowers and so on that gets put on the altar for altar maintenance? 

The fundamental problem in most forms of Buddhism is suffering. If there is no afterlife, the problem of suffering can be solved with suicide. The historical Buddha's solution was tightly related to a realization about the nature of who we really are. I am a secular Buddhist. I read other modern secular Buddhists and also think of solutions to the problem on my own. Tom Pepper's Naturanlistic anatman, roughly says the the relevant unit of analysis is the collective consciousness. Individually, we don't exist, i.e. we lack certain desirable features of existence, such as a permanent, unchanging core. Collectively, we will live for a very long time, or at least until we render the planet uninhabitable. The goal is the liberation of this collective consciousness. Individual suicide will not help and killing everyone is impractical, to say nothing of the additional suffering it would create to even try. Also, on my own, I've thought a lot about what the historical Buddha may have been like. He strikes me as a depressed young man who lived in a world where everyone around him said were he to die, he'd be right back in the miserable world again. He didn't go forth into homelessness because he was happy and well adjusted at home. Normally, we are eager to believe we are immortal. We fear death more than anything, so much so that we will tell ourselves any lie to convince ourselves of our immortality. If you are depressed, you want the pain to stop. Not surprisingly, many depressed people take euthanasia into their own hands. For the Buddha, were he to literally believe in reincarnation, even this won't help. But after meditating, he realized no part of himself was eternal. And consequence is that reincarnation and all beliefs in immortality of the self are bunk. Liberation is liberation from the belief in reincarnation. Further more, he realized that if he stop expecting things to last, he could gain some equanimity and peace and step out of the rat race. That state is nirvana, where you aren't exactly happy, but are in a comfortable state of anhedonia, something modern psychologists wouldn't think well of. The Buddha originally was going to keep his mouth shut about this realization, since he didn't think anyone would get it. Within in one generation, no one got it anymore. Nirvana was heaven and enlightenment was just the path to a better heaven in the old system of reincarnation. This process accelerated with arrival of Pure Land ideologies and the influence of Zoroastrianism in Mahayana and Hinduism in everything else. 

There is a famous multicentury argument in the history of Chinese Buddhism as to if enlightenment is something achieved after gradual practice and improvement or something you realize or achieve in a flash of inspiration. Which schools were gradualists? Was this an actual distinction or was this a rhetorical device? Are there any surviving (as in existing right now) gradualist schools? Was Tien Tai/Tendai/Nichiren Buddhism gradualist? 

Tantric rituals harness the power/engergy of taboo acts by including either actual or visualizations of alcohol, meat and sex into the ritual. In that system, does it still work if people don't actually believe that there is anything wrong with drinking alcohol, eating meat or sex? Also, maybe I just am not familiar with tantra, but this list is 3 out of five of the five precepts. Do tantric rituals also harness the power of theft and killing? 

The Boddhisattva vows, which were both a monastic and lay code had a prohibition on keeping weapons: 

The 1st precept has already been covered. I think there is another interesting Buddhist angle to this, which is samsara. Western Buddhists generally don't take samsara very seriously-- our life is comfortable and it's hard to convince us otherwise. If samsara is a real thing, then the world we are in problematic and can't be solved with technical solutions. Interventions to improve the world by adding, say starlings to the US, rabbits to Australia, or the nutria to Louisiana-- all of these attempt to improve things were disasters. Someone who takes samsara seriously would expect the solution of slaughtering all these starlings, rabbits and nutria to be a disaster as well. An example waiting to happen is the suppression of disease with vaccinations (the equivalent of wiping out a problematic species). It works, but we only need public health to lapse for a short for a generation or so, and I imagine the death toll will be huge as we aren't no longer protected by the old fashion defense of darwinian survival of people with selective genes. I'm not advocating stopping vaccinations, just trying to illustrate how samsara is sort of a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation. In the Buddhist system, the solution to samsara is nirvana, we stay and suffer or we exit the whole realm. One of the monks I like to read clearly does take samsara seriously and is highly skeptical of modern attempts to improve samsara from within it. Personally I hope he is too pessimistic, but I have to admit his line of reasoning is very Buddhist. Ref: $URL$ $URL$ 

Okay, I did my own research and here is what I've come up with so far. Interestingly, the artist is making a reference to this Pali suttra: 

I'm asking about what ancient traditionalist wrote or believed, particularly the ones the reified the narkas, i.e. took them literally. Us humans don't normally remember our past lives and this is made explicit in Mahayana, where one of the qualities of a Buddha is that they can remember past lives. If people are reborn in hells and they don't know why they are there, I'm not sure how effective the punishment is. Did anyone come up with a rationalization for punishment for crimes they don't remember, or did people in the hells remember what they did? 

So so everything up to the 7th Bhumi is something that could be done without being reborn elsewhere or as a superbeing. The middle Bhumis, 4-7 sound like variations on the same thing. This is a quality of the Avatamsaka in general-- the authors are always trying to hit a list of 10 things, and sometimes they run out of items and just repeat one a few times. 

This bothered me, too. Most of the time when you read about the Buddha, you get the 3 sights story as the story of the Buddha's life. Except that story was essentially a Jakata tale. On otherwords, no one knows the details of the historical man's life anymore. The fine detail about his parents, his thoughts and motivations before and after going forth, it's speculation and stories that were made up much later. To get a feel for what really happened and what it meant, we have to have a feel for how the family systems worked at the time. Martine Batchelor in her book "The Spirit of the Buddha" described an guy in an ancient world who would likely have been in an arranged marriage, married at age 14-16 or so, immediately had a kid and then went forth a decade later, not long before his son would have been married. (Wild tangent, recently I read that Rahula can mean fetter or disability, which makes me wonder if he had a child with a disability). Anyhow, Sidhartha was in a marriage he didn't ask for. It appears his extended family, aunts and so on would be taking care of the kids and the wife. I'll see if I can track down the references later. From Stephen Batchelor's "Confessions of a Buddhist Atheist": "The abandonment of his wife and son would probably have troubled him less- they would have been cared for by his extended family--than the rejection of his duties to the Gotama clan and the Sakiyan community" Stephen Batchelor painted a picture of Sidhartha as sort of an ancient college boy, who left his arranged wife at home while he went off to college at Taxila University (the equivalent of of going to Athens to study with Plato and Socrates). He would have returned home just long enough to have kid and would have been out and about taking care of business. In other words, family life was being a cog in the wheels of tribal politics and farm business, not a romantic relationship and maybe not much of a relationship at all. Anyhow, in either scenario, it sounds like the guy was unhappy. After the Buddha had founded his Sangha, he went back home and recruited his son to the sangha. Some stories say the same of Yasodara, his wife, that she become a nun. They joined the new family business so to speak. Even Ananda and Devadatta were cousins. Anyhow, if you want to find family values in the Jakata tale, the Buddha's father was a model father who wanted only the best for his son-- to shelter him from all suffering. 

Chanting- # of matra repetitions. Chanting is noisy meditation, usually counted with mala beads. Prostrations- # of prostrations. Prostrations are like meditation, but with constant motion Infractions of precepts - Even early Buddhists were expected to list their infractions at Uposotha. Meditation time. I know monks used to use incense sticks as timers, so they'd meditate for n incense sticks. Meritable acts. In Mahayana texts there are many rhetorical flourishes that involve merit accounting, such as "you can transfer 1/8 of the merit of a good act to your deceased kin.", or the merit of doing this is more than the merit of doing that (i.e. a measure that is rankable) The math geek in me wishes they'd fully developed the system, but AFAIK, it wasn't a fully developed system. It sort of reminds me of the Boy Scouts effort to do one good deed a day. Vajrayana also has many practices that are done n times, with merit accruing for each, such as turning prayer wheels, making flags, etc. 

I'm in the US, with <1% self identified Buddhists in most counties. So there isn't a lot of established customs as there are abroad, where wearing say a white band in Theravada countries, or a pilgrims hat in Japan (worn by hikers as they hike from temple to temple). I organized a Buddhist book club and generally don't use a table tent, I forget them and lose them. So the American thing to do for group identity is to get a T-Shirt. I'm thinking of one like this: $URL$ 

I was reading through the sutra (well, using global search in my kindle) to find references to the word mathematics. In at least two places the author suggests Bodhisattvas should study all manners of topics to be of benefit to others, including mathematics. And in at least two places, the text goes on and on naming extremely large numbers and describing how to calculate them using powers of ten. These chapters seem to have been written by the same guy-- an interest in large numbers and their application to Buddhism can't be that common. The last chapter, the Gaṇḍavyūha, even wikipedia says it used to be a suttra separate from the rest of the book.
