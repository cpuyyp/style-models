Check out Raft, by Stephen Baxter. It paints a vivid picture of human life in a universe where gravity is "a billion" times stronger than it is in our universe, where gravity is the strongest force on the atomic scale which allows for "gravitic chemistry", and where the average human has a decent gravitational field of their own. Life exists in nebulae surrounding black holes, and stars short-lived events a mile across. Really interesting stuff. 

Thus bypassing or terminating the process would cause errors all over the system, resulting in a non-functioning mind. Add emotional rewards To reach a truly conscious mind, you're probably going to include some form of emotional processing. Adding in a simple "Pleasure signal" whenever your AI follows its ethical guidelines and a "Pain signal" when they go against them would very nicely mimic the kind of signalling that goes on in human brains. Speaking of human brains, Include mirror neurons Humans have a very interesting feature of our brains. There are neurons in the brain that fire when we perform an action, but also when we see that action being performed. When these neurons are artificially stimulated, a person watching a picture of a hand picking up an apple will twitch their fingers in time with the action on the screen. This is likely to be a key element in empathy. Including mirror neuron-type processes in the AIs mind could be a powerful tool for stimulating empathy and preventing the AI apocalypse. It's important to note that most of these tools are far too complex for humans to effectively implement in the new AIs. These are tools that early AIs would use to ensure their 'children' do not wipe out their masters. Thus you need the first generation of AIs to already have some level of empathy, enough for them to want to protect their creators. You need several different tools available for different levels of operation. In the Culture I mentioned above, the development of new AIs is carefully controlled. They're created with a set of general parameters, which include benevolence, and are then permitted to develop their minds freely within those parameters. This is not all that different from how human minds develop. 

Check out Raft, by Stephen Baxter. It's loosely part of his Xeelee sequence, but it's a standalone novel with few ties to the series. It examines life in a universe with much, much stronger gravity, strong enough that humans generate a significant gravitational field themselves, and humans living in a nebula of breathable air around a black hole. Baxter has a degree in mathematics, a doctorate in engineering, and has taught maths and physics; he does hard sci-fi incredibly well. 

What you want is an event called a lahar. A lahar occurs when a snow-capped volcano erupts, sending a mixture of volcanic ash, mud, water, and debris barreling down the mountain at frightening speeds. Lahars are deadly. The water may well be hot, even nearly boiling, so anyone who isn't crushed by debris or drowned by mud can be cooked to death in seconds - and yes, all it takes is a single eruption. No magic required. The eruption may not necessarily melt all the snow, if you don't want it to, but it certainly could if you did want to. It depends entirely on the type and direction of the eruption. 

I think that trying to directly change the genes is going to be too dangerous and too complex to manage. We've been intensively studying the human genome for decades, and we're not even close to being able to reliably say what genes are necessary for specific traits. Rather, magic should be used to blend the foetal genome with that of another person or animal who has a desired trait, or to mold the body's features 'blindly'. Blending This would involve a woman focusing on a person or animal who has the desired trait - let's say blue eyes - and creating a connection between the desired one and the foetus. The woman wouldn't know exactly what was happening, but the magic would make the foetal DNA more like that of the desired one. The woman would get a 'feeling' when the change had been accomplished. She could only change one trait at a time, and there would always be the possibility of other traits changing along with the one she wanted, or the new trait mixing unpredictably with existing traits. For example, she might want to copy a great politician's intelligence, but accidentally get his sociopathy along with it, or she might copy blonde hair and blue eyes into a foetus that already has reduced melanin production, and accidentally make her child albino. Molding This would be a rather hit-and-miss method, with a woman using a meditative state to blindly "Change" the foetus, and observe the result. If she liked the result, she could make the change permanent; if not, she could reverse it. The more deeply a mother could meditate, the more detail she could see in the result of a change - untrained mothers would only be able to see the effect of a change in the next few weeks, fully trained and enlightened women would be able to see the result up to the age of about ten years. 

Get a job as a trucker Not to be all stereotypical, but it's a sad fact that a lot of people disappear along highways in the Americas. Several high-profile serial killers have used interstate highways to find and dump their victims, and been very successful at it. A stretch of highway in Canada is known as "The Highway of Tears", a place where maybe more than 40 women have disappeared, with only one murder ever being solved. Truck stops are frequent haunts of prostitutes; these unfortunate women would be easy pickings for a succubus. There are also roadside bars and cafes where she would be able to pick up men of her choice (biologically speaking, men are a lot easier to seduce than women). The naturally nomadic lifestyle of a long-distance driver lends itself horrifyingly well to a serial killing life. If the heat in one region gets too bad, they can always just drive elsewhere and keep on keeping on. 

Perhaps he encoded some kind of emergency backdoor into their DNA - a set of instructions or commands they would obey on an instinctive level? Just as humans find the noise of nails on a chalkboard inherently unpleasant, because it reminds us of our ape ancestors' warning cries, his voice could be inherently obeyed. He could also have built into them an instinctive delight at the taste/smell of some food or spice that he has available, or perhaps even his own personal pheromones. When any of them come anywhere near him, they feel such delight and ecstasy that they forget what they were trying to do to him. A tailored virus is certainly an option, especially one that has an unusual and evident effect - perhaps it turns the skin of anyone infected blue, or something - and he could then use that to say "Look, I infected you with something harmless; if I wished, everyone with blue skin would be dead right now". 

We're getting some very good results here on Earth using interferometers, 'virtual' telescopes with dishes hundreds or thousands of kilometers across that are 'built' by combining the data from multiple sites in a computer. This got me to wondering. I know the theory behind such devices, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details of exactly how it is done - specifically, whether the data needs to be combined in real time, or whether recorded observations can be compiled and combined after the fact. The Colonisation Program - an autonomous, non-governmental organisation that exists to train people as colonists and send them to new planets - has access to six of the twelve Faster-Than-Light starships in the human galaxy. One of their primary missions is to search for potentially habitable planets, gather as much information as they can about them, and then send missions to colonise them. To this end, they want to build a really big interferometer and I, as the God of their universe, have to decide whether they can or not. So, here's the question: Given access to an FTL starship to courier data back and forth, is it theoretically possible to build an interferometer array from telescopes in multiple different star systems, with a baseline measured in light years? If it's possible, how much detail would such a telescope be able to see in a star system hundreds of light years away? If it's not possible, what would be the maximum practical size of an interferometer? 

Replace the nitrogen in the atmosphere with neon. Neon is a noble gas, very similar to nitrogen, which is non-reactive in most situations. It also glows red when ionised. This means that your planet can have a breathable atmosphere, since neon can be inhaled safely, and a mixture of yellow sunlight with a gently glowing red atmosphere should give you the orange sky you're after. 

Using this system the Maya could track dates from the year 3114 BCE up to 4772 CE with ease. You can use something similar to track large expanses of time in your world, especially if you're willing to use periods greater than 20. For example, we westerners might like to use a structure of Year.Month.Week.Day, especially if we were willing to make our months a little more sensible and set them all to 28 days long (1 lunar month). This year would begin at 2017.01.01.01. We don't generally use 0s in our time counts, so we're starting at 1 for each period. Today's date (as I type this) would be 2017.05.01.01 To make this truly useful to track very large dates, though, we should add a fifth period. I would suggest the Great Year - the time it takes Earth's axis to precess a full 360 degrees. A Great Year lasts about 25,800 years; we could divide that up into 12 periods to represent the signs of the zodiac, giving us a period of 2,150 years per constellation. 

Attack their logistics. However advanced they may be, a fleet like that has to eat up a LOT of fuel, spare parts, and other consumables. Those consumables have to be replenished somehow. Identify resource extraction and distribution centres, and have your allies strike several of them at once. Position your super-ship at one of the sites, but do not have it take part in the initial attack. The AI will be obliged to defend these resource sites, even if it suspects a trap. When reinforcements arrive, your allies will immediately withdraw, while your super-ship takes down the reinforcements. Keep striking like this, causing damage each time. Sooner or later, the enemy will be obliged to launch a raid into your territory to try to prevent future attacks; this will extend their supply lines, and allow extensive commerce raiding. Your super-ship should be superior to any force that the enemy will use to escort its merchantmen; you'll effectively be in the position of the Bismarck loose in the Atlantic, free to strike against supply ships wherever you find them. Either the enemy massively increases its escort forces, which will burn the resources you're already making more scarce, or they sit still and run out of resources. If you can pull it off, and keep your ships in fighting shape themselves, you'll be in a good position to degrade the enemy's combat performance until you can take on the fleet directly. 

What should we wish for? It's hard to say, exactly, without knowing more about what 'one wish' means. Can we wish for the knowledge to create clean energy and plentiful food, for example, or would that count as two different wishes? Ultimately, in my opinion, the best wish would be for a greater ability to go against our own base emotions and instincts, and a broader sense of humanity as a whole. If we could just be rational about things, we'd be a lot better off. What would we wish for? We wouldn't. If the world had to come to a single, conscious, group decision, we'd probably never manage it. Instead, we'd end up with wars being fought over what the choice should be. A lot of people would dig in their heels and insist that The Wish should be "we wish that everyone believes in ". A lot of people would refuse to voice their preference. A lot of people would make frivolous wishes. In time, entire religions and philosophies could grow up around What the Wish Should Be. If Mr. Deity got sick of waiting for us all to pull our heads out of our collective backsides and decided to just read our minds and have done with it, the Wish would probably end up being something like "Food, family, and safety" - the most basic of human desires. 

Gold is a really handy medium for exchange. You can't eat it, build with it, or make primitive tools out of it (you can make complex electronics with it, but by the time you're making complex electronics you've probably moved away from a gold standard anyway). It doesn't tarnish, rot, or spoil, and nearly everyone can agree that it has value. Guns and ammo are valuable commodities, true, but ammo is also consumable - once you've fired a bullet, you can't re-use it. This makes it a poor medium for exchange. Guns are too big to be used as a form of exchange - if you have two rifles, and I have a gallon of water, you can't give me half a gun to buy the water - it's the whole gun or nothing, and then you only have one rifle. You're not going to be willing to make that trade. It's historically unclear whether a true barter economy, where goods with utilitarian value were traded for other such goods, has ever really existed. It appears that within groups something akin to communism or socialism existed, where everyone got what they needed and did what they could, while between groups trade took the form of a mutual exchange of gifts. I might gift you with a years supply of water, and you might give me a rifle in return; both of us have gained in the transaction, and we'll be more likely to trust one another next time. On the other hand, if you have two rifles and ten gold rings, and I have a gallon of water, you can give me two rings for the water and not have lost anything vital. I'll accept the rings, because I know the guy on the next farm has some potatoes, and I know he'll accept gold rings as payment. I also know that if the flesh-eating were-rabbits of Golgotha have snuck in and eaten the farmer before I get there, I can hold onto the gold until I can buy the pretty daughter of the wandering trader who comes through. It won't lose value by tarnishing, and I won't need to shoot it at said were-rabbits; its value is secure. In the end, any medium of exchange has value because people agree that it does. Gold is perfect for that use. If everyone really is at the subsistence level, and nobody has anything to spare anyway, that is the only time that gold will truly lose all its value. 

I assume your planet didn't have its atmosphere artificially removed or anything like that; assuming there's still atmospheric pressure, some hints of a breathable atmosphere, byproducts of former life and decay, etc. First, we can't say that everything would have died. Fungi and lichen could have lived on for a surprisingly long time, feeding on the dead biomass left behind. Chemosynthetic bacteria in hot springs would have a field day, with no large animals around grazing on them, and their population could support a variety of filter feeders and microbivores. So you've probably got at least some biosphere to work with. In the areas that didn't have any life left, you'll have a situation similar to the area around a recently active volcano, or a landscape recovering from recent glaciation. This is a process called Ecological Succession, and specifically Primary Succession. In short, you'd start with the introduction of simple lichens, mosses, and algae. These species would live directly on the sterile rock or former soil. They may need some support in the form of bacteria to help them break down certain rocks, but they're designed for this sort of thing. These pioneer species would break down the rock into soil and enrich the local environment; they'd also begin modifying the atmosphere. In a surprisingly short time they can create an environment that can support larger plants. An excellent example of this is the island of Surtsey - it emerged from the sea as a brand new island in 1963. In 1998, the first bush was found growing on the island. There are now around between 30 and 60 species of plants growing on the island, which started as bare volcanic rock just fifty years ago. I'm afraid I can't help with the question of how quickly temperatures could climb, but I'd be inclined to suggest "pretty damn quickly". Especially if there's a significant amount of CO2 or methane in the atmosphere, which would be natural byproducts of the death of an entire biosphere, a surprising amount of heat could have been retained during the 'ash winter', and it could maintain a pretty solid greenhouse effect in the early days.
