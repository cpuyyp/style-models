Now you may be asking, "OK, so perhaps it wasn't about big vs. small, but still what was the effect on representation of small states vs. large ones? That question is actually a bit tough to answer. In the Senate obviously its a big deal, as my own Oklahoma gets the same voice as California, even though we have a tenth of its population, and less people than Los Angeles. When voting for President, you could argue that a Floridian's Presidential vote is worth only half of what a Montanan's is. However, that ignores the fact that Florida is a huge electoral prize evenly divided between the two parties, while Montana is only worth 3 votes, and is dominated by one party. Thus politicians give the big state of Florida way more attention both during and between elections than they give little Montana. 

There just weren't a lot of such people in the US in the 1800's, at least until the Mexican/American war. No census bothered to count them, which is a pretty good indication right there. At the beginning of the century the census just counted "free white", "slave", and "free colored". After the Civil war, they dropped slave, and split non-white into "black" and "mulatto" for a while, then "mulatto" was dropped and "indian" was added, then at the end of the century "Chinese" was added. That gives you a pretty good idea of how the 19th century mind looked at the composistion of the USA. In the 70's where I grew up in Oklahoma it was common to refer to "Mexicans". Some would say this was reasonable due to that country's preponderance in what we call the "Hispanic" demographic today, while others considered it a kind of ugly ignorance. The later attitude won out, and referring to groups of people as "Mexicans" is now considered offensive by a lot of people. I still today get in trouble sometimes for referring to "Mexicans" on my soccer team, even though the people I am referring to are in fact Mexican citizens. However, this clearly goes further back. The first attempt by the census to count this demographic back in 1930 was in fact a new "race" category called "Mexican". The 1890's are just as close to 1930 as 1970 is, and they most likely didn't invent that "race" name on the spot. So I think its fair to extrapolate that in the later 1800's this was probably already going on, and in fact "Mexican" was being used for what today we would call "Hispanic". 

Basically what these critics are saying is that (according to them) it seems he decides what he wants the history to be, then goes out and looks for facts to back it up. It should go without saying that good science does things the other way around. I note on this same page that there's actually a Wiki page for the Indigenous Aryans theory. Reading through there, it appears the theory itself isn't taken particularly serioiusly by the various historical and scientific communities it touches on. To give an example, one of the largest sections in there is titled "Pseudoscience and postmodernism". Regardless, you may buy his argument, and he may even turn out to be right. However, getting back to your question, I think it is fair to say that you aren't in fact going to find a lot of serious published research along these same lines. I am sorry. 

There were actually about 70 towns (by Plutarch's count) named after Alexander, but he didn't found and name all those places himself. He was the founder of the various Greek states (even if mostly by virtue of conquest), so it would be perfectly natural for the Greek ruling classes to want to pump up his reputation, including naming a lot of things after him. He did in fact found rather a lot of towns though (not all named after him, and many "repopulations" of older town sites). According to the authors there, most were military centers for his soldiers, who weren't realy keen on mixing with the locals. 

So from this standpoint, we would consider the French to be descendants of the Romans (along with Italians of course, and all other Romance speakers), but not the Germans or English. 

Objective Journalisim, the idea that a media outlet should report news in a politically neutral way, is pretty much a 20th centrury concept. Cynics claim this change was driven by the need to raise revenue through advertisements. No advertiser wants their product placed next to an article that ticks off a lot of their customers. Partisan propaganda during this period was supposed to be confined to editorial pages, and the direct efforts of the campaigns themselves. Of course spreading your own propaganda yourself is expensive, so politicians typically only bothered to do it right before elections. That left them the balance of their time to do stuff like run the country (if they so chose). However, it is now the 21st century. The advertised print model of media is dying, and the new online and cable TV outlets find that the best way to get a loyal cadre of eyeballs is to be partisan. So now, for better or for worse, we are back to the old days of media dominated by full-time partisan propaganda outlets. 

Based on archeological evidence, the expansion of Indo-Europeans into Europe went hand-in-hand with the introduction of Neolithic techniques. In plain English, the Indo-Europeans were the area's first farmers. The important thing to realize about the introduction of farming is that it supports orders of magnitude larger population than does hunting and gathering. In any given area where both cultures might try to live together, there would have ended up being 10 to 100 times more farmers. So the simple fact is that it doesn't really matter much. If the gatherers tried to fight, they'd lose. If they tried to peacefully coexist, they'd get culturally and genetically swamped. There were just not enough of them to make a dent in the oncoming wave of farmers. They'd hardly even be a speed-bump. A society's best bet would be to try to hole up in an area that's bad for farming, or adapt to the new techniques (without somehow not also adopting the new language and culture). At least a few managed to do that, as there is still one group of native non-Indo-Europeans still in Europe, and there were a few more in historical times. 

The headress is called nemes, and is only worn by Pharaohs, sort of like the symbolic function a crown would have to a European. The statue is simply a way of telling those who can't read that Agustus Ceasar is their ruler. However, the Roman rulers never came to Egypt to carry out the cerimonial functions required of a proper Pharaoh. If you look over the dynastic lists, you'll see that they end in 30 BC with Cleopatra. 

No, but nobody was asking him to either. I haven't been able to dig up much about Carter endorsements in 1976, other than that there weren't many. There was a prominent "ABC" (Anybody But Carter) movement, chiefly driven by the fact that he was a moderate white southerner, and thus unlikely to be supported by the base during the general election. His performance in the primaries proved otherwise. During the general election, support from popular Democrats is typically helpful as surrogates (its a big country, and the candidate can't be everywhere), but McGovern wasn't all that popular after losing so badly. Nobody was seeking out his support for anything. As to why McGovern would feel like voting for Ford, one thing that strikes me reading though that interview transcript is this later part: 

One correction I should make here though. Galician in Spain is a language cousin to Portugese. It is a Romance language, and doesn't have any closer relation to Celtic languages than any other Romance language does. (How close is a matter of debate. It used to be popular to combine them into a sub-family. Today that idea is out of fashion). 

It seems most likely that Wormtounge was in fact modeled upon Quisling. In fact, you'd have to invest some work to convince me otherwise. The Lord of the Rings was written from 1937-1941 just as all this was happening, and we know Tolkien was using the term himself in 1939 (before even Churchill). 

That sounds like just one person's theory. There is really no consensus on when humans acquired language, but most do seem to think that it was at the least part of the package of being an anatomically modern human (Homo Sapiens), so it is at least 100,000 years old. Thus any finds that predate language are probably not human (as we tend to think of it), but rather one of our ancestors or a sibling branch of genus Homo. However, some scholars think most of genus Homo had language as well, which would essentially push the birth of language back to a time when all of our ancestors were confined to Africa. This would also make it roughly coincident with the earliest stone tools. 

What happened in the meantime is what always happens with unusual 5-4 decisions: As soon as the membership in the court changes, lawyers start to test the decision by bringing up cases against it. By 1967 by my count the court had 3 personnel changes since that decision. By the time Perez' final test came with Afroyim, it was found wanting. * - This point's arguable, indeed that's why we still need courts. :-) 

It does appear to have been trouble, yes. I present as evidence the Rover Boys series, which was popular juvenile fiction series published from 1899 to 1923, roughly akin to Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew novels. The heroes were wholesome (but rambunctious) heroic young men, while their antagonists were written as low-class individuals of violent nature and imperfect English. Or as the Rovers put it, "..not our kind at all." On at least one occasion, when the writer wanted a stereotypical nefarious den for the villains, he picked a billiard hall. 

The right response is to laugh at it. I don't think this can or should be directly rebutted. Arguing details of a theory that is that far from the mainstream implicitly puts it on equal logical ground with every mainstream analysis. This is ceding it ground it has not earned. There are still some first-hand witnesses to the Holocaust around. However, there are less and less every year. So let's prepare ourselves by putting them aside for now. All we really have to go by in History (what we call historiography) is sources. How many do we have? How reliable are they? Do they tend to back each other up, or are they contradictory? In short, how well-attested is the event in question? Looked at in this way, it becomes much more simple. Here's a tiny sample of nearly universally accepted historical events that are not as well-attested as the Holocaust: 

This implies to be there's a great deal of guesswork in this number based on the only historically reported fact available (a report of the size of his army). So it should probably be taken as no more than a rough order of magnitude estimate. 

Just looking over that wikipedia link, I'm seeing a lot of references to British monarchal eras and Highland fashion. So it could be that this was an item primarily prevalent in England and Scottland. England is not exactly famous for its sunny climate, and average temperatures there even in the summer appear to be a few degrees cooler than in Poland (where you are performing this re-enactment?). Where I come from in the middle of the Continental USA, it would be considered downright cold. We regularly have days a good 40 or 50 degrees F hotter. Scottland is even colder, murkier, and damper. A wool lining would be highly desirable there, both for its insulating properties, and for its wet-weather behavior. Also that area was pretty much the wool-production capitol of Europe. So the material would have been much more plentiful (and cheap) than it would be most other places. Most Scottish nobles could probably skim it for free from their own estates. So I don't personally find this all that unlikely. However, garb in Poland may have been different, and summer garb in Spain or Greece was almost certainly different. For my money, unless you can import Scottland's climate for your re-enactments too (perhaps run them in the spring or fall?), I wouldn't take versimlitude to quite that extreme. If you are sweating like a pig due to overheating in a non-historically accurate climate, that's a bad re-enactment too, isn't it? Then again, I'm not much of a SCA or LARPer, so I don't know the culture like you do. 

(Discourse on the last bullet follows. Skip it if you like) Douglas S. Robertson took the idea of the Information Age and went even further. He classifies all societies based on the amount of information, in bits, that a typical member has access to. I believe this is called "Informationalist History". Where is the amount of info one mind can hold, and is probably in the vicinity of 5Mb (5*106 bits). 

The problem with doing that is that there was an established precedent in Western Europe that an "emperor" had to be proclaimed as such by the pope. Even Napoleon, who held a popular referendum on his accession to Emperor, required a Papal ceremony to make it official. For a protestant ruler, that's obviously not going to happen. Now, he could I suppose have just started calling himself "Emperor". Holding a lot of territory outside the nation of Sweden would probably justify a better title than a mere "King". But most of the rest of Europe would probably not have accepted him as a proper Emperor without some higher authority bestowing it. I should note that there's a subtle difference between conquering (and ruling) what was then known as "The Holy Roman Empire", and actually being the Emperor. A protestant such as Adolphus could quite possibly do the former, without necessarily doing the latter. All the quotes I've seen on the matter so far seem to be implying no more than that. 

1 - This is the area we today call "Indonesia", although he mistakenly thought Japan was down there too. Because that would have made them even closer. 

I'm going to guess here (no way to know for sure without talking to him), that the term used was indeed a holdover from the days when Blue Discharges existed. After Congress got rid of those discharges, they didn't stop discharging soldiers for those reasons. They just created two new discharges; "General" and "Undesirable". General was still considered honorable (and thus eligible for some veterans benefits), while "Undesirable" was not. I believe these are roughly equivalent to today's "General" and "Other Than Honorable". "Undesirable" does seem to have been used for homosexuals (who hadn't engaged in such acts. Doing that got you a fully Dishonorable discharage instead.) until the policy was changed in the 80's. However, it was (and OTO still is) also used to discharge soldiers with mental health issues (eg: PTSD). The military is just starting to grapple with changing this policy, at least in circumstances where a psychological injury may have occurred in the line of duty. Of course those discharges aren't limited to those causes. A person can also receive them for things like disobeying orders, adultery, fighting, drug use, or anything else your superiors don't like, but don't want to bother with convening a full courts-martial for. 

In theory, history should not enter into this. China signed the UNCLOS, which specifies exactly what their territorial rights are in that area. They clearly did so with enthusiasm, as they were one of the charter signers way back in 1982. If they didn't want to abide by that agreement, they shouldn't have promised to do so. The US (or history prior to 16 November 1994) theoretically shouldn't even enter into the discussion. The US hasn't signed that convention themselves, so they aren't really even a party to the dispute. Where they do come in is that the convention itself has no real military teeth. If China really feels like ignoring their agreement, the other signatories around the South and East China seas aren't really militarily strong enough to do anything about it. That situation exists in large part because the stronger of the countries in question (Japan, South Korea, and perhaps the Philippines) have been relying on the US Navy to handle the lion's share of their Naval protection needs. Some of that is due to US colonialism, particularly with respect to the Phillipines. However, in Japan's case its probably more accurate to say it has to do with Japan's own history of colonialism.
