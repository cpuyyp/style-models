These bases give you different values for arc elasticity. The second base gives you $1.2\dot{2}$ so it seems to be the one your textbook expects. I guess it is best if you see the difference between point elasticity that is used by the rule and arc elasticity. Other than this you have to ask your professor what definiton of elasticity she/he expects you to use. 

Suppose that there is no 45 percent tariff and the market is in some kind of equilibrium. That is the demand for yuans equals the supply of yuans at the current exchange rate. Now assume Trump does impose a 45 percent tariff. This makes imported Chinese goods in the US more expensive for the American consumer. As a result the consumers will buy fewer Chinese import goods. So far they paid for these goods with dollars and the corporation importing the goods used those dollars to buy yuans and pay for the goods. As a result of the decreased import demand the corporation will want less goods and hence it will buy fewer yuans. Thus decreasing the demand for yuans. The currency exchange market is similar to other markets: If at a price (in this instance this is the USD/CNY exchange rate) the supply outstrips demand the price will decrease. This means that the dollar becomes 'stronger', you will have to pay more yuans to get a dollar. As a result exports do become somewhat more expensive (in yuans) and imports do become somewhat cheaper (in dollars) until an equilibrium is reached on both the currency and the good markets. 

Using the 'utility monster' critique of aggregate utility maximization it is pretty easy to show that gen. comp. eq. does not always maximize aggregate utility. Imagine a pure exchange economy with two agents, $A$ and $B$ and two types of goods, $x_1$ and $x_2$. Agent $A$ has nothing whereas agent $B$ has one unit of each good. The agents respective utility functions are $$ U_A(x_1^A,x_2^A) = 2x_1^A + 2x_2^A \hskip 20pt U_B(x_1^B,x_2^B) = x_1^B + x_2^B. $$ Trivially the initial distribution is a competitive equilibrium and also trivially it does not maximize aggregate utility. 

Short-term interest rates are set by the central bank (in most developed countries; things are different in places with currency pegs). Longer-term bond yields should roughly equal the expected path of the short-term rate (plus a term premium). One can debate this point, but it is a fairly standard assumption. 

Normally, they aren’t, but there are exceptions. For example. The Japanese Ministry of Finance includes principal repayments in its definition of “debt service” - see budget summary for 2014, page 4. (The inclusion of principal payments in debt service seems to be a convention for external debt: how much foreign currency debt that needs to be paid back can matter for credit risk. Floating currency sovereigns like the U.K. have negligible credit risk for their local currency borrowings.) The reason why it is ignored principal repayment is a fairly meaningless number in government finance. If the government issues \$1 billion in short-term debt, in one year it will have: 

This approximation ignores the reinvestment of any coupon income, and the convexity effect (the return sensitivity changes slightly as yields change). Also, the bond yield convention is probably different than the convention used for total return. That said, for yield changes under 50 basis points, the approximation is typically pretty good. 

The “law of supply and demand” is a feature of economic models with supply and demand curves. These are usually mainstream equilibrium models. It is somewhat difficult to relate these models to real world behaviour. I am in a theoretical camp that is critical of such models; perhaps someone else can give a better account. As for your questions about stock prices, you probably would need to look at the mechanics of stock trading. Investors post prices at which they are willing to buy or sell, and then others will transact at those prices. (In some cases, market makers are the ones posting the price.) Those participants can change their posted prices whenever they want, typically in response to news. The prices can move without a single share trading hands. This can be interpreted as a shift in the supply or demand curve. If someone has a big order to buy or sell, they can clear out the first set of posted prices, and transact against other orders. This will result in a price change. For example, assume there are orders to buy 100 shares at \$10 and \$5. An order to sell 200 shares would first clear the best bid (\$10) and then hit the next bid (\$5). In this way, big orders can change prices. A longer version of this example. 

The problem is basically to derive the cost function of a firm. What you need to do is minimize costs given the output. That is $$ \min\limits_{K,L} w \cdot L + r \cdot K $$ subject to $$ K^{\frac{1}{4}} \cdot L^{\frac{3}{4}} = Q = 120. $$ You can solve this using Lagrange or the implicit function theorem (similar application as the MRS). 

I think what you need is that if $U(x,y)$ is homothetic then $$ \forall \alpha \in \mathbb{R}_{++}, \forall (x,y) : \hskip 6pt \frac{\frac{\partial U(x,y)}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial U(x,y)}{\partial y}} = \frac{\frac{\partial U(\alpha \cdot x,\alpha \cdot y)}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial U(\alpha \cdot x,\alpha \cdot y)}{\partial y}} $$ and love. 

In Solow's growth model the growth rate of the output or GDP of a country is denoted by $g$. In the model this can be decomposed to $$ g = g_l + g_k, $$ where $g_l$ is the growth rate of the effective labor force and $g_k$ the growth rate of capital. If you calculate the growth rate of per capita GDP population growth will not play a role. (Per capita growth is 'kind of' like $g_k$, but not quite, as technological advancements are factored into the growth rate of effective labor.) Does historical data support the statement that the effect of population growth on per capita GDP growth is zero? I did some limited searching and it seems that while US growth is sometimes set as an example to other western countries, the real difference is in population growth, not per capita GDP growth. 

It depends on the assumptions you make. If you assume that preferences are locally insatiable then no. Without this assumption, it is easy to construct counterexamples. Consider an economy with two consumers ($A,B$) and two goods ($x,y$). Both consumers have preferences represented by their utility function $$ U_i(x_i,y_i) = \min(x_i,1) + y_i. $$ If the initial endowments are such that the total supply of $x$ is larger than 2 then the equilibrium price of $x$ is 0. (The numeraire is the good $y$.) 

The "shares outstanding" variable used in the calculation of market capitalisation is defined as all shares that exist (and not was issued in public offerings). The market capitalisation is the share price times the outstanding. Therefore, the numbers in question do not apply. There is no need for shares to be transferred in a public offering; an initial investor in a firm before it was listed could sell to another investor privately. This means that there is no good way of tracking how many shares are held by "the public," and that number is not used in calculations. 

The description of market events in newspapers is not necessarily reliable. The job of a newspaper editor is to sell newspapers. Readers of the business press like to hear that government borrowing raises interest rates, and so the editors give them that story - a lot. Financial market analysts are paid to give good forecasts, and their explanations are often quite different. (That assertion is based on my experience of writing and reading interest rate commentary.) In this case, the newspaper account may be an accurate reading, but you must keep in mind the prior knowledge that they blame practically every tick up in yields on fiscal policy. Treasury bond auctions are announced in advance, with the amounts fixed. (They move around money market auctions to deal with fluctuations in cash.) the sizes are based on a lot of consultations with the Primary Dealers and investors, and internal analysis. However, since they fixed the quantity, the price (yield) has to swing. If investors think the yield is too low, it will affect the bids at auction. Going into the auction, there is “when issued” trading, which is based on where dealers think the auction will clear. If they are wrong about demand, actual yields will not end up where the “when issued” pricing was, and the whole curve moves. (Dealers will end up receiving more bonds than they expected, and so will have to trade out of their larger-than-desired duration position.) This dynamic is behind the legitimate stories about tepid auction demand. The best approximation of inflation expectations is to look at the spread between conventional bonds and TIPS (inflation-linked Treasury securities). The spread roughly equals the future rate of inflation that gives the two securities equal returns. E.g., if the 10-year nominal yield is 4%, and the 10-year TIPS yield is 2%, an inflation rate of 2% results in the two securities having the same return. (One can argue that there are risk premia that drives this breakeven inflation rate away from the true expectation.) There is no guarantee that inflation expectations (by this measure) and nominal interest rates move in the same direction, so one should not use the concepts interchangeably. The usual explanation for the linkage between higher future deficits and higher nominal interest rates is that “all else equal”, a relaxation of fiscal policy would result in higher nominal GDP (with higher inflation). The presumption is that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to keep inflation near its implicit target (offsetting fiscal policy). The expected change in the policy rate affects nominal bond pricing. The exact mix of what happens depends on the specifics of the change to fiscal policy, and your beliefs how fiscal policy works. In any event, all the bond market participants care about is what the Fed does. Otherwise, stories that increasing fiscal deficits raise interest rates run into the counter-example of modern Japan. The debate about that effect is highly political. See also this question: link to question on interest rates and deficits

Air is a complement good for a lot of things. If you get no air at all then food, gold and iPhones give you no utility either. And air is free! Except in Spaceballs... 

The story (and Jo) have basically nothing to do with the benefits Pepper plc will get from economies of scale. As you have stated economies of scale means that the average cost (cost per unit) is less if you produce in large quantities. An example: Assembling a car with drills and screwdrivers is really difficult and time consuming but a robotized assembly line can do it quite quickly. However, the assembly line costs a lot of money so it will only pay off if a lot of cars are produced. Since Birmingham, where Pepper plc. is located, is a large city it has a large market for electronic consumer goods. Therefore Pepper plc. can sell a lot of these goods, hence it has reason to produce in bulk, so the unit cost is less. Thus the company may sell its products cheaper or have a higher profit. (This depends on the market environment.) 

The actors of an economy have a liquidity demand function $L(Y,i)$ where $Y$ is the real income in the economy and $i$ is the nominal interest rate. This function shows how much money the actors keep. (Not wealth, but wealth that is not tied down assets.) It is assumed in the IS-LM model that $L(Y,i)$ is increasing in $Y$ because if you have more income you also spend more and to do this you need more money. It is also assumed that $L(Y,i)$ is decreasing in $i$. If the interest rates are high you have an incentive to deposit more of your wealth and keep less of it liquid/instantly accessible. Now the points of the LM (Liquidity - Money Supply) curve are those $(Y,i)$ pairs for which the liquidity demand equals the money supply. Suppose that given some money supply $M$ and price level $P$ you have $$ L(Y,i) = \frac{M}{P}, $$ so the market for money (liquidity) is in equilibrium. Then this point (Y,i) is on the LM curve. While we keep the exogenous variables $M$ and $P$ unchanged we would like to see if there is another pair (Y',i') such that $$ L(Y',i') = \frac{M}{P}. $$ Suppose that $i'>i$. Because the function $L$ is decreasing in $i$ this means $$ L(Y,i') < L(Y,i) = \frac{M}{P} = L(Y',i'). $$ Since $L(Y,i') < L(Y',i')$ and $L$ is increasing in $Y$ we have $Y < Y'$. Thus if there are two points on the same LM curve and the nominal interest rate is higher in one point, income must the higher in that point as well. I believe this is what Floyd meant. If you dislike dealing with general function forms you may assume $$ L(Y,i) = \frac{Y}{i} \mbox { or } \frac{Y}{1+i}. $$ 

What percentage of bonds are purchased by the central bank is not an issue. The Bank of Japan has been holding large amounts of Japanese Government Bonds for years, and inflation has not budged. The key is that the deficit is very large (working from memory, some cases were 30+% of GDP), and they were often associated with losses of productive capacity. In other words, the big deficits were the problem behind hyperinflation; a central bank buying existing debt is just a reshuffling of government liabilities. Attempting to run "too large" deficits and trying to use central bank purchases of bonds reserve requirements to control inflation will not work in the long run. The velocity of money would just increase as people move towards shadow banking. If done for a long enough time, people can just switch over to using a foreign currency, which is usually a critical step towards hyperinflation. In summary, running a deficit of 1% of GDP and having the central bank buy all the debt (monetising it) is not going to have much of an impact on inflation. (The recent experiments in quantitative easing provide a test case.) Running a deficit of 30% of GDP is probably going to cause serious inflation (unless the country switches over to rationing, such as in World War II), and what the central bank does with its balance sheet is not going to make a big difference. 

In market convention, the clean price is the quoted price. Accrued interest starts off at \$0 at a coupon date, and then rises (roughly) linearly each day until it matches the value of a coupon at the coupon date. The exact formula is a fixed schedule that depends upon market convention. If you buy a 1% annual coupon bond one day before maturity, you will probably have a clean price very close to \$100. The accrued interest will be very close to \$1, and so the dirty price would be close to \$101. The deviation of the clean price from \$100 would depend on the deviation from 1% for the yield you bought it at. The exact accrued interest will depend on the daycount convention in the market. In any event, people use the clean price precisely because there is a “pull to par,” we do not have to worry about the coupon when thinking about the bond price.
