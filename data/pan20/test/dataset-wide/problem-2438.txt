As far as I can remember, at least in the Pāli canon, there was nothing explicitly prohibiting people from following the teachings without taking Refuge. On the other hand, I don't believe that this encourages a "one foot in the water one foot on the ground" attitude. It's rather that the act of taking Refuge was considered a matter of fact decision for those deciding to follow the Buddha, because the canon is packed to the brim with examples of people taking Refuge after a discussion with the Buddha- both monks and lay followers. Benefiting from something and actively pursuing that thing are 2 different matters. There are for example Christians who've integrated Zen meditation into their practice, and they see absolutely no problem with it (and rightfully so) because they're just benefiting from a certain Buddhist teaching, they're not commiting to Buddhism. It seems to me then that a person cannot "follow" the Buddha's teaching without taking Refuge (as far as people that that do have the possibility to go for Refuge are concerned of course). However one can still definitely benefit from it in various ways. Attaining Enlightenment without taking Refuge is possible. According to Buddhism, innumerable Buddhas and arahants appeared in ages where there were no Buddhist teachings, and can still appear (paccekabuddhas). But just because this is possible doesn't mean that it's an easy matter since reaching Enlightenment is already a very difficult task for Buddhists. People who are very spritually advanced can do it without following Buddhism, normal people (pretty much all of us) cannot. The guiding principles concerning Refuge is thus, as I understand it, intention and commitment. Taking Refuge is just a technique to help a practitioner retain his commitment to the teachings, nothing more. It has no value in and off of itself. If a person is serious about following the Buddha, Refuge will naturally follow if there are no obstacles to it. 

That type of koan is called a breakthrough koan. It is meant to lead to a sudden, initial insight that is direct awareness. I have heard practice of breakthrough koans described as, "becoming one with the koan", which implies concentrating on it like a mantra. The insight it leads to is beyond concepts. So by becoming one with the koan, in a flash, you will actually experience "Mu"/tao/the way. As opposed to just conceptualizing it. Wuzu Fayan said, “It is like an Ox that passes through a latticed window. Its head, horns, and four legs all pass through. So, why can’t its tail also pass through?” The ox, being conceptual thought, has been transcended; "Mu" 

He who has arrived in such fashion, i.e. who has worked his way upwards to perfection for the world's good in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas. He who walked in such fashion, i.e. (a) he who at birth took the seven equal steps in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas or (b) he who in the same way as all previous Buddhas went his way to Buddhahood through the four Jhanas and the Paths. He who by the path of knowledge has come at the real essentials of things. He who has won Truth. He who has discerned Truth. He who declares Truth. He whose words and deeds accord. The great physician whose medicine is all-potent. 

Do you like the Temple? Is it beautiful in your eyes? Judging by your response, it sounds as if it is very meaningful to you. I know that when I visit my local Zen center, entering the meditation hall causes such a reaction (along with a deep feeling of peace). Crying is a natural human response to many situations and stimuli. This article offers a socio-biological reason for the crying response. Interestingly, at least according to Wikipedia, crying in Buddhism is considered unskillful, as it indicates clinging/attachment. 

Bhante Vimalaramsi is dedicated to teaching insight progress through jhana, following the original Pali suttas rather than the commentaries. He is the abbot of Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center. 

I have read that even hunger - a physical sensation in the body - is useful for an object of meditation. Given the fact that I am often hungry and am quite aware of this sensation in my body...and given the fact that I easily gain weight when I allow my hunger to dictate my actions (i.e overeat or eat without thought)...I thought it would be useful for me to see what insight I might get into examining this sensation more deeply. I was wondering what others' experiences were with using hunger itself as an object of meditation. Normally I just try to focus on the breath (I am still attaining to the 1st level of concentration practice) but thought this might make for an interesting deviation. Assuming that this is a reasonable object for concentration practice, how do I actually go about it? 

As for abandoning one's old religion due to making an "official" entry into the Buddhist path, that's pretty much what has to happen. A person cannot be, for example, Muslim and Christian at the same time. It's the same with Buddhism because its "endgame" is irreconciliably different from the one that Abrahamic religions have. On the other hand this doesn't mean that former Christians have to abandon and "betray" Jesus or the entirety of Christian teachings. A number of teachings point to the same things as in Buddhism and those practitioners will benefit from them. Jesus' life, even with his holy nature taken out of the picture, can be an interesting study for Buddhists. The Buddha did not harbour enmity against other religions and if I remember correctly advised his newly "converted" disciples to not sever friendly relationships with their old teachers. From this we can see that while severing links with the teachings of one's former religion is necessary, there's no incitement whatsoever towards taking a negative attitude against them. Within this light, taking Refuge and entering the path must be a well-reflected upon decision, if one is hesitating about doing it due to considerations about the former religion then one shouldn't do it until that hesitation is dealt with. 

You need to also recognize that what is impermanent is stressful and what is stressful and impermanent is not self. 

It is correct that a stream-winner will not not break the five precepts. On the other hand, that is not one and the same as perfect morality. As an example, from Mahasi Sayadaw's Manual of Insight: 

From my own understanding of the Maha-Assupura Sutta, after abandoning the five hindrances the practitioner enters Jhana. After having obtained Jhana the practitioner works on insight. On abandoning the five hindrances: 

Alcohol is banned in Olympic shooting events as a performance enhancing drug. Alcohol in small doses helps the shooter remain calm under pressure, focused and even slows their heart rate. Obviously, if competitors consume too much alcohol their balance, steadiness, reaction time and motor skills become impaired. It all comes down to dosage. Being sober or drunk is not a binary relationship. There are degrees and a continuum to everything.

What are the three marks of existence and where are they found in the canon? Is there any fundamental differences in interpretation among the different traditions? 

Working from "bottom to top", Working from the "middle to the top", Working from "top to bottom", Working from the "middle to the source". 

In Suzuki's "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind" (online copy here), instruction is given on how to form the specific hand position (mudra) when meditating. He advocates "put[ting] your left hand on top of your right." This is the position I have been using in my short months of meditating, and is the position also taught to me at my local Zen center. However, this resource, by Ven. Mahathera Nauyane Ariyadhamma, advocates the opposite: "back of the right hand over the palm of the left." Question: why the difference? and, Does it even matter? 

This link goes into detail about how to construct and use a colored-wheel kasina device. I have been using this 'method' for a few weeks now to some good effect...there is something about being able to concentrate on a tangible visual object that makes it easier for a beginner like myself to cultivate and sustain concentration. 

As a beginner, I practice two forms of meditation: one focusing on the breath (typically with eyes closed), and one focusing on a colored disc (kasina), obviously with eyes open (unless cultivating the after-image). All descriptions I have seen for the former describe the arising of the counterpart sign when the eyes are closed. However, from what I have read on kasina meditation, the counterpart sign seems to arise with the eyes open. I have not experienced either of these myself (and in fact, this link dismisses its importance altogether), so I would like to ask: is it possible for nimitta to form iin either case?
