Put a strong magnet on top of a shell and turn it upside down. If the magnet sticks then you know it contains steel shot. If it doesn't, then you could have either lead or "non-toxic" shot. If you paid less than $10 for the box, and/or the box doesn't make a big deal of stating that it's non-toxic, then the shells almost certainly contain lead shot. If you really need to know what it is then you have to open a shell. It is perfectly safe to cut into the hull anywhere in the shot column. If in doubt just cut off the top, or cut and pry open the crimp. Now dump some shot out. If you can't tell by looking at it whether it's lead then put it on an anvil and hit it with a hard hammer. If it flattens easily it's lead. If it doesn't flatten before shattering, or if it begins to powder as you hit it, then it's "non-toxic" and contains primarily tungsten or bismuth (and you really should have been charged more than $10/box!). Amendment: The lead warning on the box is referring to the primer compound (lead styphnate). Dinitrotoluene could be used in either the primer or powder. Dibutyl phthalate is probably used in the hull, assuming it's plastic, but could also be a binder if the shot is "non-toxic." 

"Buck and ball" loads are commonly available. They're often marketed for self defense, but where legal for hunting they have the same benefits on game, namely: The "ball" (or slug) has more reach for aimed shots on further targets, but if you happen to get a closer-in target you have the "insurance" and added stopping-power of the buckshot. 

I'd recommend an outer shell plus a fleece jacket - two items. The advantage here is that if the fleece is too warm (or too cold), you can replace it with another fleece that's more appropriate. Which means you can use a lighter, thinner fleece for spring and Fall, and a thicker fleece for winter. Just about any brand of shell and fleece will work. If you're gung-ho on quality, then I'd recommend the Marmot or Cloudveil brands. I own a Cloudveil shell which I've had for years, I've used it backpacking and hiking all over the Western U.S.. Very good quality. Marmot is also very impressive. I don't think there's anything softer than a Marmot fleece. 

Don't use an intact sunfish as bait. cut it up and use the cut pieces on your hook. But, as far as attracting and hooking big largemouths, while at the same time deterring other types of fish, what I have found to be the best are crawdad lures and buzz-bait. Both of these are excellent. The buzz bait are large and noisy, this tends to discourage the smaller fish from trying, and it tends to excite the predatory instinct in the larger largemouth bass. I have never caught a small fish on a buzz-bait. It's always been good, healthy sized ones. The crawdad lure is also excellent. Crawdads are almost ubiquitous in any type of lake, it's a natural prey of the bass. You will get some smaller bass on these, but you'll never get a sunfish. Getting bass on nightcrawlers also works, but not as effective as the lures I mentioned, and in my experience you need to be reeling in the nightcrawler in order to attract the bass. 

I regularly use a machete to clear brush. I must be using the wrong technique for the tool ... or the wrong tool given my technique. In order to maximize the speed of the blade, I rotate my wrist forward before it strikes wood. This causes the pommel to dig into the lunar pad (bottom face opposite the thumb) and quickly blister it. Shown here is my starting grip: 

In the U.S. there are legal definitions provided by code (18 USC 921) and regulation (27 CFR 478.11), which are somewhat derived from the customary definitions. A shotgun is designed to shoot shot (i.e., multiple ball projectiles) through a smooth bore. Yes, you can buy rifled shotguns designed to fire a single projectile, but they still shoot shotgun shells, which are large caliber and produce low maximum chamber pressures. I believe the SAAMI MAP (Maximum Average Pressure) for shotshells is always under 12kpsi. And the smallest standard shotshell I'm aware of is .410. A rifle is designed to shoot a single projectile at high pressures through a rifled barrel. It is common to see MAP for rifle cartridges over 60kpsi. And it is extremely uncommon to see a man-portable rifle with a bore larger than .50 caliber*. (And perhaps even less common to find shooters willing to get behind one's trigger ;) So a decent definition could distinguish these firearms primarily by design pressure. It is true that you can find rifle ammunition loaded to lower pressures. You can even find some corner cases where a rifle is loaded to fire more than one projectile â€“ e.g., the M198 "duplex." You managed to find a .22LR "shot shell." That's just a weird product: It's a low pressure round, and its effective range is measured in feet because rifling throws shot into a ridiculously wide "pattern." I.e., you can fire shot through a rifle, but other than as a point-blank "snake" load, or just out of curiosity, you wouldn't want to. It really fouls the rifling, and it doesn't let you hit anything at a distance with any reasonable probability. *ATF exemptions exist, so that's not just because in general rifles over .50 are classified as Destructive Devices. 

I've spent many years hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains and California, and animals I have seen more than once or regularly include black bears, deer, elk, moose, wild turkey, beaver, mountain goats and longhorn sheep. I've never seen mountain lions, although they are plentiful, but they keep themselves hidden. My aunt's husband says he wanted to photograph one once, so he hiked up into the mountains of Colorado and camped out at a place where he knew he had the best chance. He camped out there for a few days. On the third day, he was sitting outside reading a book when he saw a movement. He looked up, saw a cougar looking at him, he reached over for his camera and had just enough time to take a photo of its hind legs as it ran away. 

Before, you leave treat your equipment with water-repellant spray, and consider taking a small bottle with you. Some things that come to mind: 

The gear answer depends on what kind of environment you're in: rainy and wet like the Pacific Northwest, dry and sunny like the Southwest. Mild climate, or very hot or cold. At a minimum, comfortable hiking shoes that have decent tread/grip and cover your ankle. The most important criteria is comfortable. You don't have to get fancy or spend a lot of money. I met a guy once who hiked one peak every day for two years in different states, and he used $20 hiking shoes from Walmart. His other gear was minimal too: a light rain jacket, slacks, hiking stick, and a small waste-pouch for carrying a snack or bottle of water. Physically the way to start is simply to start doing it. The thing I always remember is a passage from the book "A Walk in the Woods" where the author, who was overweight and out of shape, with no prior hiking experience, relates how he simply started, and by the time he was a few weeks into it, his body was already accustomed to it. There's really nothing special you need to do for training. If you want you can go to the gym and get on the stairmaster. 30 minutes/day, 3 or 4 days a week is enough to keep you in shape. I sometimes will do this to prepare for a backpacking trip because I don't hike regularly, and this preparation helps a lot. 

Is there a better tool for cutting brush, or maybe just a better grip, given my hand size and strength? Amendment: If I don't break my wrist it feels like I'm "hacking" with too light of a tool. Blade speed is much lower, and so much less work is done with each stroke. If I were to not break my wrist I could use a much heavier tool: A much longer blade, or a blade at the end of a long handle, which would give the same blade speed and power per stroke without having to break my wrist. But what am I describing? A pike? (And then there's the question of what to do when I have to pack the tool into the wilderness....) Second Amendment: I also realized that if I don't break my wrist I can't reach a lot of brush: If I keep the blade at a right angle to my arm then I have to bend to hit anything lower than 3 feet off the ground, and I have to wade further into the brush to reach more central branches, which is an often thorny proposition! 

When I go trail-clearing I generally carry two machetes and a felling ax, but I haven't found a practical way to sling them so I can work with one without taking off the other tools. The machetes have cordura sheathes with loops, and the ax has a leather bit sheath with a loop. I have this feeling that people who do this for a living must have clever carrying rigs or slinging techniques so they don't have to drop everything whenever they need to take a whack at something. Are there any ways to carry or rig tools like this so: 

I would say the answer is somewhat subjective, and in order to make a fair assessment you will need to invest some time. Carrying a 30-pound pack up and down hills with a week's worth of food and gear produces different stresses on your feet and joints than a water bottle and rain jacket. The fit may seem less perfect if the material between your toes starts to dig in when descending a steep slope. Of course, being so accustomed to the VFFs, it might take you an even longer time to break in new hiking boots and get conditioned in them. Personally, while I might wear my VFFs or sandals on a short day hike, I am skeptical they would be sufficient on a serious multi-day trip. That is no indictment of Vibram the company or the FiveFingers as a product; for many of the same reasons I would not attempt a mountain hike in Tevas, for example. The reasons include the following: 

None of the above may be dealbreakers on their own, but they could impact your pacing; perhaps you walk more deliberately around obstacles or stop more often to adjust your toes. 

Sulfur is often suggested for natural mosquito repellents. I've seen recommendations for taking sulfur pills, making sulfur creams, or applying sulfur powders. According to the Colorado State University Extension, the sulfur content of cloves is the science behind garlic-based repellents or recommendations to consume garlic. That said, I would not think eating a match head to be any way to get sulfur into your body. A safety match head is mostly potassium chlorate fixed to ground glass. A strike-anywhere match head will have phosphorous in it as well. 

Press moistened paper into the target container, which can be a box of any sort. The paper should be wet enough and pressed hard enough that at least a little bit of water is squeezed out upon pressing. You don't have to wait for it to dry to shoot it. The advantage of pressing wet paper hard is that you can eliminate density variations and pockets. E.g., you won't find the arrow penetrating 2" in one spot but 6" (or worse) in another. Create a laminate target by stacking the paper/cardboard and then compressing and strapping/taping the back of the stack. By shooting into the ends a target like this can last a long time because, ideally, the arrows are stopped primarily by friction as they slide between two sheets and get squeezed to a stop. This is the concept behind the popular "Block" targets, which use layered foam. 

How can I determine whether a shotgun fits (or can be easily adapted to fit) me without having the chance to test fire it? (And without spending thousands of dollars for a customization?) Whether for shooting clays or birds we know that "fit" of a shotgun to a shooter can be critical to the shooter's ability to hit what he points at. When I take people clay shooting I bring several different guns. Even with first-time shooters I can see that if they're missing wildly with one gun, simply handing them another with a stock of different proportions can allow them to start making consistent hits. Can this sort of general shotgun fitment be done without access to a range? If so, how?
