Clouds Different types of clouds sit on different layers based on altitude, air pressure, and relative humidity. You mentioned your atmosphere has breathable air, does it also have water vapor in the atmosphere? Are there rain clouds? Methane clouds? Sulfur Dioxide clouds? Maybe an enterprising character notices that the moisture collectors are collecting more methane than before, or that when they head into a storm cloud, they get more violent turbulence than before. Depending on how far up they are, maybe they are used to riding out some of the more violent storms that happened lower in the atmosphere, but the protagonists have a rude awakening when a storm that they previously wouldn't have paid mind to 10 years ago tragically destroys their town. 

A river will make people want to spread out, gradually extending out the civilization and causing them to build towns and hamlets farther and farther away from the main city. Here's some reasons why: Fish Fish are a great source of protein. Fish guts are a great source of nitrates which can improve crop yields or reduce the amount of time a field must lie fallow between usages. Fishers would gradually spread out over the length of the river to try to find different pockets of fish or just to go upstream of a popular spot that is being overfished. Farmland A good river deposits nutrient-rich silt and irrigates the landscape, meaning that all up and down its banks would be super fertile, especially compared to the surrounding landscape. Nearby animals would come and graze on the grass growing near the river, as well as drink there, meaning the river banks would become great spots for hunting, too. Any enterprising farmer would want to settle away from the rest of the other farms to try to get more good land to till. Washing, Water and Waste I assume your city has people who wear clothes, get thirsty, and use the bathroom. The river will naturally be a super convenient place to dump your trash and, you know, take a dump. I'm sure some of your more well off citizens would want upstream water so that it doesn't taste so... earthy, or to wash their clothes where they know their neighbors don't dump their garbage. This means that more downstream city folks might find themselves more vulnerable to cholera, or in general get a dirtier river, causing more wealthier folks to try to move upstream. Trade Eventually, people in the one area of the city are going to realize it's really easy to move heavy objects if you put them on a raft than dragging it along by yourself. This will mean there will be warehouses and markets on the banks of the river. Merchants will associate the river with more trade and more wealth. People will build up their houses around these markets, and then it comes to pass that the only way to really expand your business is to build up more river docks. This and the waste problem will cause people to: Riverfront Spreading It's a treat to be able to have riverfront property. The views are nicer, you get better breezes, quicker access to water, your own little private quay. People will grab property on the riverfront, and as your city develops, more and more people will have to build farther and farther up and down the river to grab that good riverfront property. 

I think it may be a mistake to ignore the environment to a larger degree. Life has evolved to handle immense pressures and temperatures, but not bullets - because there are no bullets in nature. If however, the environment contained objects with bullet-like potential, a very long slow evolution could indeed yield such results. The what could be anything from 'unobtainum' micro-meteors raining down on the planet every few days (from comet-trails composed of such a material), through to a common defence mechanism of other life-forms on the planet. (Plants that have evolved to "shoot" spines using chemical reactions). The latter plants is in my opinion a better option, as an evolutionary "arms race" would occur between armoured-animals, and the plant-guns. Many answers have centred on rapid-evolution, and I will state that I am certainly not. Evolution is rarely rapid in anything short of geological time-scales. @cobaltduck mentioned in the comments Spider-Silk, and this is a very good option. Spider-Silk Body armour is a possibility!, Spiders obviously do not weave fibres, though they may cocoon prey. However given millions (if not billions) of years in an environment that demanded it, it could be very possible for a species to evolve specialised cells that lay strands of Spider-silk like material beneath the hardened skin/scales. Another option that springs to mind is the Dragon Skin Body-Armour, using ceramic plates this man-made armour can stop AK-47 rounds at close range. While "baking" ceramics with strong composites is a intensive process for technology, Nature could (and would) find short cuts, depositing layers of material with specialised cells. Again, I place my favour on this second option - while it has already been stated there is no such thing as "bullet-proof", Ceramic plates are pretty-damn close in modern warfare, Modern combat armour often includes such plates, capable of stopping most rounds (short of armour piercing). Specificity the gamer's Favourite the .50 calibre. Good technical research for this topic would be the Cells involved in Bone Creation, Osteoblasts and osteocytes these cells constantly dissolve bone-calcites and place fresh layers. 

So a 70 kg spider producing just 1 g of silk a day would need an additional caloric intake of 4500 Cal per day for silk production. Since real spiders eat enough to tide them over for days at a stretch: 

The reasoning behind this is that smaller an animal, larger the fraction of their body mass consisting of structure rather than reserve. Structural mass involves maintenance costs, while reserve mass does not; ergo small animals respire faster and need more calories per mass than larger ones. Assuming Kleiber's Law to hold true for these giant spiders, we can calculate their metabolic requirement by comparing it to a "real-life" spider of comparable activity levels, plus caloric requirement of silk production. A Goliath Bid-Eater, the largest tarantula species by mass, weighs around 70-80 g on average (though it can grow to be 170 g). According to spider-care websites[2], a diet of 6-8 crickets per week is sufficient for "the larger tarantula species". That's only about 10 Calories a week! By this calculation: 

I believe the question is aimed at a scientific 'Macgyver' solution, in this regard, consider this: The scientist has a key-chain flashlight, by filing down (hunk of glass/costume jewl/quartz from the earth) he is able to focus the light to a point. He removes some bark from a tree (point A), focus' his light-source at another tree (Point B), and walks to it, removing some bark from the next tree, and pointing the source away from the first tree (A), he decides on the next point to travel to (Point C). Or, given a laser-pointer.... But that's too easy. None the less, it uses the play that light always travels in strait lines. This type of mechanism is often used for maintaining alignment of tunnels during mining - though on a more accurate scale. 

In our world, many branches of pagan belief, (and other religions) have a concept of a "higher self". This higher self is connected to a person's "soul" via an intangible stream of energy from their "cosmic conciousness" into the person. An example of this is Avatar, the last air Bender. The protagonist (Ang) learns from a Guru how to connect to this "cosmic self" by opening his 'chakras'. Doing so grants immense power (and control of his 'Avatar State'). If this concept was in your world a Reality, then perhaps the Evil Wizard harvests the souls, not for their innate energy - but rather to gain the magical-energy being communed to the earthly vessel from another plane of existence / the cosmos itself. Akin to forcing many streams to meet by digging trenches, thus forcing a river. While an average Joe may not be able to tap into this energy, if it is the driving force of wizardly-magic, the evil wizard may be able to "force open" the stream of energy granted to even an average soul. Perhaps even doing so to make up for his own impotent potential (being evil not allowing him to achieve "oneness" with the universe, like his teacher-wizard Kenobi tried (in vain) to teach him.) 

Give them a super good river You're a benevolent God, so give your people a nice, reliable, tamable river. I'm not sure what is irrigating your farmlands, but I'm going to argue that a river naturally will get people to move and explore. 

This means, that as people spread out along the river and travel up and down it and more importantly down the river, you're eventually going to end up at a sea or lake or ocean. Then, everything that made the river so appealing to follow will be cranked up to overdrive as people move up and down the shore in both directions, and eventually people would be so interested in what is beyond the sea/lake/ocean that they build big honking ships to go and try to see what's on the other side. If this whole scenario super plausible that's because this is exactly how early civilizations evolved and expanded. 

Spiders don't need to eat that much. In terms of food requirements, giant spiders would be fairly supportable by most environments. As per Kleiber's Law: 

Let's take that number as "Caloric requirement at rest", since a captive Tarantula would have limited activity as compared to a 'wild spider' who would need to actively hunt for prey. For spiders, a significant source of metabolic cost is also silk-creation. [1]. So the more web/silk a giant spider produces, the more calories it will need. Spider silk is light - enough spider silk to go around the world once would only weigh 500 g, but let's say these giant spiders spin proportionally thicker silk, so that the same length of silk weighs a 100 times more. 

The paper linked above also gives an equation for activity cost of web building. Total Cost of Web Construction ~ (4.5 * Weight of Web in mg) + [Weight of Spider in grams * (2.79 * Weight of Web in mg)] calories I'm assuming this activity cost gets taken care of by Kleiber's Law, but if it doesn't, then the dietary requirements would be: => (4.5 * 1,000) + [70,000 * (2.79 * 1,000)] = 4500 + [70,000 * 2790] = a whopping and unsustainable 195,304,500 Calories! (An adult African elephant needs around 70,000 Cal per day for comparison)
