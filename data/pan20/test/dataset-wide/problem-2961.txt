According to Davidson, a sentence like Brutus stabbed Caesar can be represented as ∃e.stab(Brutus,Caesar), where e is a reified event. Is there a term for something that's not an event? I first thought of "entity" or "individual" but both terms are used in some ontologies for everything including events. 

In event semantics the logical form of (1) is (∃e,x) every(x) & dog(x) & bark(e,x). As for (2), one would add the conjunct loud(e). The latter formula implies the former, as one would expect. Now consider 

Emmon Bach uses in "The algebra of events" the term 'eventuality' to denote states, events, processes, etc. How can their actual existence be expressed logically? For example, when I say "John came" the eventuality e in ∃e.came(John) obtains whereas in "I want John to come" John's coming is an eventuality which doesn't obtain. Can a first-order predicate be used, something like Obtains(e)? 

Option 2 is correct. One could also use resolution. If there's a clause p∨¬q and another clause q∨r, one can conclude p∨r. If there's no such pair of clauses, the set is satisfiable. Otherwise one gets a smaller set of clauses and since it's finite one will finish after a finite number of steps (possibly arriving at a contradiction). 

Davidson argues that events are individuals. According to him, the meaning of Brutus stabbed Caesar is ∃e.stab(e,Brutus,Caesar), that is, there was a stabbing, Brutus did it, and Caesar underwent it. Likewise, Caesar died means ∃e.die(e, Caesar). Is there a reason not to view states as individuals, too? Something like ∃s.dead(s, Caesar) for Caesar is dead? One could then say, for example, that 

Again, the logical form of (4) implies that of (3) (since A & B ⊃ A). But in this case, (3) entails (4) because "few" is a decreasing quantifier. Is there a simple solution to this "paradox"? Update: a note on the notation (to avoid confusion): In Davidsonian event semantics, sentences are represented as (existential closures of) conjunctions of literals. In dog(x), x can be a dog or a set of dogs (or some others individual that can be lexically described as dog). In this so-called conjunctivist approach, every(x) implies that x isn't a specific dog, but - as some put it - a typical/generic individual defined by the eventuality dog(e,x). There's one axiom in the theory that say that if something holds of a generic element of a set, there's an eventuality with the same predicate for every member of that set. Formally, genericel(x,s) & y∈s & P(e,x) ⊃ (∃e′)P(e′,y). This technique is widely used in commonsense reasoning, but as one can see, there are problems with some quantifiers. 

-1 is an integer having the property you specified. In general, you may be thinking of a unit in a ring. That's an invertible element. 

It has the same meaning as the saying that "You become what you oppose." Our laws create criminals; our religions, prostitutes. The more you try to control something, the more out of control it gets. Look at our "War on Drugs," which after 40 years has resulted in a society in which drugs are more easily available than ever. 

We are not the sum of our components. We know from biology that all the cells in our body are completely replaced in seven to ten years. We know this is true because it's in the New York Times! $URL$ If our cells are completely replaced every ten years, are we still us? I say yes. We are not the sum of our cells, let alone our atoms or quarks. We are the template or pattern underlying the generation of the cells. 

Godel's theorem says nothing about human understanding. It only places limits on certain formal axiomatic systems. Humans have ways of understanding that transcend formal axiomatic systems; for example, we can extend a given axiomatic system to prove the truths that were unprovable in the unextended system. As an example, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) can neither prove nor disprove the Axiom of Choice (AC). But we can extend ZF to ZFC, and thereby prove AC. This has nothing at all to do with theology. It's strictly a matter of formal mathematical proofs regarding axiomatic systems. 

It sounds like you might be interested in the subject of reverse mathematics, in which logicians attempt to determine the exact set of axioms needed to prove a particular theorem. $URL$ A more general issue is that you're concerned that perhaps ZF[C] is inconsistent. But after all, mathematics was a very successful and rigorous discipline from the days of Archimedes, Eudoxus, and Euclid up until the early 1900's when the axioms of ZFC were agreed on. ZFC's a relatively recent development, and is already known to be problematic in many ways. Various alternative foundational systems are under development even as we speak. Complexity theory, category theory, and homotopy type theory are just three that come to mind. If ZFC turned out to be an insufficient or even inconsistent basis of mathematics, the vast majority of working mathematicians wouldn't be too concerned. The classic case is the development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz. It was a spectacularly successful theory; even though its proper logical foundations were not developed for another 200 years. Conclusion: You do not need a proper foundation in order to do mathematics! This is counterintuitive to modern students who have been trained to regard ZFC as the foundation of math. But historically, discoveries in math precede logical rigor by decades if not centuries. So the answer to the big picture question you raise is that if ZFC were to be found inconsistent tomorrow, nobody but the foundationalists would care. And they'd just get busy working out a new foundation. 

Lets say, I am an astronomer, Bob Down jr. When I was twelve years old I was a perfect naive realist. I did know nature as something bigger and more powerful than me. Not that I had no power. No doubt, only two decades later I would have been traveled to Alpha Centauri. Each morning I saw the sun shining, the central star of our planetary system. Earth was rotating to make morning and evening, and a tilted rotation axis made summer and winter. I started my scientific career. But somehow it also came and I started reading philosophers. First was Spinoza, of course. Decades later I made it up to Heidegger and I started to accept that I would never even have asked, how the morning is made up, if I not always already would have been seeing the sun rising. All my science was already confined in the first place between birth and death (had some Levinas too). Nature was all and only what I could see. Then I catched up to Meillassoux. Finally! For sure I know the sun is not rising, but the earth is rotating. It was rotating long before mankind already (but not always already). And yes, I know there is a time before and after earth, I am an astronomer. And yes, I have had enough physics courses to know about the facticity of chaos (turbulence, non-linear systems, even that quantum stuff). Nothing is made, also not morning and evening. The earth rotates, period. No purpose. But wait: my job is to discover the laws of nature. And now the chaos is such that even these laws may change at any instant? This is a complete different chaos than what I know about! The chaos of natural sciences is still deterministic (and yes, I guess even quantum stuff is). And even if it turns out some constants of nature are not that constant at all, it would still be possible to find a non-changing law including that. These days, when I see the sun rising, I am truly shocked. Of course I fell apart from Heidegger. And I know it's wrong. But is it? What if over night the laws of nature have changed? What if the sun is really rising? Am I then one who always already believed the earth is rotating, but it is not? How can I even still know that? What time includes both phases of nature? And if there is no such time, if all this only happens due to a singular rupture in absolute time itself: how can we ever know it has changed? Wouldn't memory rupture as well? How, then, can we even do natural science? And if not, how can we ever know for sure the earth was rotating before the time of man? What, if back then the sun was rising? To be honest, I don't buy it. Probably, I don't even understand it. Please, help me, I'm just a poor astronomer afraid of every new morning. Or is all this believe in changing laws just the mirror of having natural science a language game, but now nature itself is gaming? Alas, this would be salvation! We could come up with a game theory! Given all that, how can I become a true non-correlationist realist in the face of changing laws of nature? Or in other words, I'd like to see a trained philosopher take over the position of specultaive realism, especially Meillassoux, and tell me how the claim of changing law of nature does not collapse the ancestral argument. And now that I'm done with Brassier, I could add the same question for his "posteriority" argument as well. What if laws of nature change suddenly and there will never be a Big Crunch but instead a period of eternal life? In my understanding, both arguments are build upon certainty of a world before and after life. But doesn't the claim of changing law of nature undermine exactly that certainty?
