You can do it either way. In 'traditional' first-order logic, the only individuals are objects, not properties. In first-order logic, one can say "there is an object that has the property F" or "all objects have the property F" but one cannot "quantify over" properties themselves. However, in second-order logic this is possible. In fact, Leibniz's Law, which summarizes something important about identity is a second-order formula: It says, "for two objects x and y, [if x = y, then for every property F (Fx if and only if Fy)]." 

A contemporary philosopher who is defending a version of monism is Jonathan Schaffer, whose work can be found here. 

It's just the fallacy of composition. The person is reasoning: It is possible for me to make money on a single hand, therefore it is possible for me to make money on a (sufficiently large) set of hands. The inference is incorrect, for the reason you mention above. 

You'll find, if you continue reading on after this passage how Descartes thinks the will enters into this picture. 

Let's supposed we're only talking about people who actually believe the ship exists, and that it continues over time. (There are many, many positions on this question, and endurantism/perdurantism isn't relevant to all of them.) The question that is at stake is how can one thing have two contradictory properties? The ship has a certain plank at one time and lacks that same plank at another, so it looks like the ship has a property and lacks that property. On the perdurantist picture, "the ship" is a four dimensional entity, and what you or I call "the ship", pointing to it at one particular instant is really just one 'temporal part' of the actual ship, which is this four dimensional entity. On this view, the same entity, the ship, can have contradictory properties at different times--such as having a certain plank at t1 and lacking that plank at t2--precisely because each of those temporal parts are not per se the ship. The ship does not per se have that certain plank or lack it, rather, the plank is present in one of the ship's temporal parts, and lacking in another; hence there is no contradiction. (think of a soccer ball--it can't be both white and black, but it can be white in one part and black in another part.) Endurantists, on the other hand, want to say that this isn't the right way to think of identity. If the ship has a plank at t1 and lacks it at t2, that doesn't mean the ship is four dimensional; it just means that having or lacking that plank isn't essential to the identity of the ship. On this view, i take it, one would simply reply to the question about the contradictory properties by saying that it is not a contradiction for a thing to have different properties at different times. In other words, perdurantists look at identity as a timeless relation, whereas enduratists think that identity is time-indexed. Nothing can be both black all over and white all over at the same time, but there is nothing about the soccer ball's being black all over on monday that means that it can't remain the same soccer ball on tuesday when it is white all over. tl;dr -- the debate is about whether identity is time-relative or not. Perdurantists say no, and hence say the ship is a four-dimensional spacetime worm. Endurantists say yes, and say the ship exists completely and totally in the present; there are no "temporal parts". 

Your question is an interesting one, and it actually gets at some really fundamental and difficult stuff. In modern philosophical parlance featureless objects are known as 'bare particulars' and there is a literature on them. See $URL$ for a recent article. E. Allaire also has an older paper that I think gets anthologized a lot. Bare particulars are discussed in connection with substance theories. Substances theorists say that reality comes in chunks. Certain things, like atom, or people, or the sun are fundamental, whereas other things, like the atom's location, or the person's smile, or the sun's color are derivative. Call the fundamental things substances. Now, the question is what exactly is a substance? You might say: "It's the thing that's got the features, the color, the smile, whathaveyou." And that sounds right as far as it goes. But then you ask, well what are the intrinsic features of the substance itself? And it turns out to be very hard to answer that question because every time you try to name some feature that belongs to the substance, it turns out to be one of these derivative properties, like color or whatever. It looks, in other words, like the substance turns out to be just a featureless container for the other properties. John Locke, therefore, famously calls the substance a "something I know not what". That is a `bare particular,' a featureless substratum that holds other properties like a pincushion holds pins. (Bare particular theories of substance aren't the only theories of substance out there, but there isn't space here for a full discussion.) The problem for bare particular views of substance is that it turns out to be really hard to explain how there could be more than one substance. Think of Leibniz's Law: Two things are identical if and only if they share all the same properties. But each bare particular has exactly the same properties as every other bare particular, (namely, no properties whatsoever). That's enough background to get you started. 

A & ~A (Premise) A (1, by conjunction elimination) ~A (1, by conjunction elimination) A or B (2, by disjunction introduction) B (3, 4, by disjunction elimination) 

This is a really interesting question. Let me see if I can make a little progress on it. Are all of the following true? 

I agree with some of the other answers that you're going to have a very difficult time spelling out exactly what the decision procedure involved would be. If the decision procedure boils down to you just stipulating that x is a "pile" iff x is composed of 47526 grains of sand (say), then you've haven't solved the problem but only transferred it to a new question. To see why, consider how an objection is going to go: Presumably being a pile on your account is an objective feature of the world, which some things have and other things lack. So, what I want you to tell me now is what grounds that feature? What is it about grain 47526 that makes the difference which suddenly confers pilehood upon the group of 47525 grains that were there beforehand? You could try to reply to that objection that it's just a primitive, unexplainable fact that 47526 is the precise number of grains that constitute a pile, but that looks farfetched. How did you come to know that precise number? What test did you perform for "pilehood" that let you determine that was the number? I think a better strategy for solving the paradox which might be in the same spirit as your proposal above is epistemicism. The view's foremost defender is Timothy Williamson. The basic idea here is that there can be no vagueness in reality; therefore there is a fact of the matter as to whether this pile of grains of sand constitute a heap or not. Rather, Williamson says, vagueness is just epistemic. The pile either is a heap or it isn't; we just can't tell which. (This is an improvement over your suggestion because it doesn't commit Williamson to having to identify a decision procedure that can tell what make the piles piles). Epistemicism solves the Sorites paradox if it is true. But, of course, whether it is true is a matter of further debate. 

I wouldn't read any serious metaphysical conclusions into the difference between the simple present and present progressive tenses in English, if for no other reason than that not all natural languages make such a distinction. 

The problem is that your formula ∃x□∃y(y=x) doesn't actually capture the idea of necessary existence. What you've said there is that there is something x such that necessarily there is something y such that *it_x* is identical with *it_y*. In order to say you are going to need to treat existence as a property and utilize the property abstraction operator λ. Confer: 

3 would appear to follow from 1 and 2 by a substitution rule. But this is surely incorrect. It turns out that the problem is a kind of ambiguity in (1). It appears that we need a way to distinguish two different ways to ascribe modal properties, we need to distinguish, in other words: 1*. It is necessarily true of the President, that he is the President. from 1**. It is true of the President, that he is necessarily President. 1* is a harmless conceptual truth, but 1** is a patent falsehood. But (3) would only follow only from 1** and 2, not from 1* and 2. So clearly, in order to avoid making fallacious modal arguments we are going to have to have some formal machinery to distinguish between cases like 1* and 1**. Notice now that there isn't really any way to do this using just propositional modal logic. We're going to need some quantifiers, and we're going to need "property abstraction", which is the modal analogue to the definite descriptor in ordinary first-order logic. (For more details, I would recommend looking at the very nice exposition of this in the relevant chapter of Fitting and Mendelsohn's First-Order Modal Logic textbook.) In other words, the addition of the machinery isn't so much just to create new logical systems, but to give us the needed expressive power to avoid some paradoxes. 

The general answer, which may admit of exceptions, is that first-order questions belong to the discipline, whereas second-order questions belong to the philosophy of the discipline. Let's try to cash that distinction out a bit. A question is first-order if it asks which objects have which properties, where the properties are not defined in terms of anything else. Different disciplines are distinguished by the different kinds of first-order properties they investigate. For instance, a first-order question in biology is: "What explains why these different finches have similar, but not identical beaks?" A second-order question is one which asks about the first-order questions. For instance, "What would it mean for some answer to the question 'What explains why different finches have different beaks' a good answer?" All such second order questions are philosophical. This doesn't mean that a practicing biologist, for instance, might not occasionally weigh in on such issues. (The boundaries between philosophy and the sciences are porous.) 

He did. Read the relevant chapter of his "History of Philosophy". I don't have it with me, but I seem to recall that his criticism of the argument centers around the fact that Anselm treats existence was a (first-order) predicate. Russell thinks this is nonsense. Russell's wrong. There are perfectly cogent ways of representing existence as first-order, but that's a different discussion. 

You seem to be wanting to argue that Berkeley's argument isn't even valid. I don't think that's right. Berkeley's point could be made formal as so: 

The best introductory text for modal logic, in my opinion, is Fitting and Mendelsohn, First Order Modal Logic, Synthese Library, 1999. It is quite important to get the full first-order treatment of modal logic for contemporary metaphysics, because you need some of the important devices (like predicate abstraction) that don't standardly get introduced in books that just treat the propositional modal logic, like Hughes and Creswell. I really like the tableau proof system in M&F too! 

Once you have Soames and Martinich under your belt you're probably ready to dive into which ever topic or field in analytic philosophy you want. So, say you read through these and find that you really want to go deeper in Epistemology. Then I would suggest that you look around on the philosophy department websites at a couple of really good philosophy departments (NYU, Rutgers, MIT, Princeton, Michigan, Harvard, Pitt, Yale) and see if you can syllabi in classes that interest you. Just start reading the stuff listed on the syllabus. That's how you get up to speed on the state of the art in a subfield today. 

Kim's book is very good. There are other general intros to the mind/body problem like Jaworski or Heil. At some point you'd want to read some of the primary sources. This collection, also by Heil contains many seminal papers. The "contemporary debates" series is good for cutting edge discussion, but tends to be quite advanced. 

This is an important and difficult question and there isn't a settled 'right answer' about it. One thing that is clear is that conceivability should be distinguished from "imaginability". I can conceive of what a thousand sided regular polygon would be quite clearly. I know exactly what that phrase would refer to and I could use my geometrical knowledge to prove things about such a figure. However, I can't really clearly imagine what it looks like. It'd look a lot like a circle form some distance, but I can't picture in my mind the difference between the regular 1000-gon and the regular 999-gon or the regular 1001-gon. Another thing that is clear is the conceivability should be something like being able to understand or grasp some concept. The things that are supposed to be inconceivable are contradictions like "round square." And that much seems right--every contradiction is inconceivable. The harder question is whether every conceivable situation isn't contradictory. Is it conceivable that Goldbach's conjecture is true, or that it is false? It's an arithmetic conjecture, so it is either necessarily true or necessarily false. And if it's necessarily false, then it's a contradiction in terms, like a round square. People who are skeptical about the use of conceivability as a guide to logical possibility think that examples like the goldbach conjecture show that "conceivability" is just lack of knowledge of the contradiction. Maybe people before modern geometry would have found it "inconceivable" that there be triangles whose interior angles added up to more than 180 degrees. But they were wrong about what is actually logically possible, because we can clearly see now that there are hyperbolic geometries, and so forth. People who do like to use conceivability as a guide to logical possibility, on the other hand, agree that such cases point to a difficulty for their theory--because it means that people pre-Riemann only thought that something was inconceivable when in fact it wasn't. However, they say, there simply isn't any other alternative. What else is the guide to logical possibility, if not conceivability? That's roughly the state of play today. 

No. For Descartes thinking things (minds) and extended things (bodies) are both what Aquinas and the medieval would have called real beings. On Descartes's picture minds and bodies are two distinct kinds of substances which are really there, independent of how anybody might think of or imagine them to be. That's what I understand a "real being" in Aquinas's language to be. What Aquinas means by a "being of reason" is a bit involved, but I can give an example. Suppose I'm thinking of a pie and considering how to slice it--i.e. into quarters, sixths, eighths, or so on. In thinking of the pie this way I'm mentally considering some object, namely possible slices. Those possible slices are "beings of reason" in the sense that their existence is just a matter of my human conceptual activity. They are purely mind-dependent projections onto real beings, which do not posit independent entities really existing outside my mind. And Descartes clearly doesn't think that is true of my mind--my mind exists whether anybody is thinking about it or not, and my mind is not just a mind-dependent projection of some other mind.
