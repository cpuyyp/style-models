So I've been trying to solve the "The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission" problem and everything I've been reading says I need to get "DCOMperm.exe". There are plenty of links to usage and download links that point to non-MS sources. I'd like to get this direct from Microsoft, but I can't find it there. Some people say that it's part of an SDK, but I'm not sure which one. Does anyone have any experience getting this exe? 

It would wake up every machine on my network up, both S3 and S5. I have to know what the MAC address of the machine is in order to wake it up. Not all machines have WoL enabled. 

What's weird is that there is a KB article that talks about this KB823658. The problem is that the hotfix was rolled up into SP2 so it should already be applied. Another weird thing is that the Boot Information Negotiation Layer Service (BINLSVC) is not displayed as a running service so I can't restart it when I make changes to the image. I do have the Windows Deployment Service (WDS) and I am hoping that it was rolled into that as well. This is a system that has DHCP, DNS, and AD installed and I have run RISETUP.EXE . This all mostly done with the default values and this is in a test environment where there is very little else on the subnet. 

I am attempting to use Global Conditions to allow SCCM 2012 Application objects to trigger the installation of a video driver package. I'm running into issues when I have both an onboard (CPU or Motherboard based) video device and a PCI-E Video card. The reason I can find is that the application requirement I setup to detect this is unable to handle the results properly. Here is how I have this setup: Global Condition 

Disable print spooler Restart machine Delete contents of: C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86 Enable print spooler and start service. Delete the network printer object and re-add network printer off of server. 

So I am trying to get Remote Installation Service Running on a Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 installed. I am trying to integrate network drivers into the image and I keep getting this warning in the event log. 

I am working with a Powershell script that adds scheduled tasks to systems in our domain. When I run this script, it will prompt me for my password. I sometimes fat finger the password and the process starts, which locks out my account. Is there a way to verify my credentials to make sure that what I typed in will validate with the Domain? I'd like to find a way to query the Domain controller. I've done some Google searches and I should be able to do a WMI query and trap for an error. I would like to avoid that style of validation if possible. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. 

So far, no luck on the fonts. I have to have a "silent installer" for these fonts so I can push it out to the 100+ machines this needs to go on. Thanks in advance 

I am running into an interesting issue with some applications not evaluating properly in SCCM 2012. The example software I have is Adobe reader 11. When I install using an MSI deployment through software center, everything works great. The problem comes up when someone goes to the adobe website and downloads the executable installer and runs that. Now software center detects the software as uninstalled and will list is as an available title. I am using the "Windows installer" detection method and looking for this GUID "{AC76BA86-7AD7-1033-7B44-AB0000000001}". When I look in the AppDiscovery.log, all I get is an "+++ Application not discovered." message. So here's the question: Where can I see what the detection method is querying and what it gets back? Bonus Question: When performing a "Windows Installer" detection, where does the system look for that GUID? Thanks in advance 

So I've been troubleshooting sleep timers for our systems and have run across an interesting issue. I need a way to report how long a system was awake after a number of different inputs. Now, I've discovered that the System Log tracks wake and sleep events and even tells you the times that everything happens at. The thing is doesn't tell you is what triggered the wake event. It does give you a numerical code however. Here are some examples of what I am finding. 

From what little I know about WMI, this is created by the SCCM client, which makes a twisted kind of sense when you think about how SCCM works. I got this location from the "Deployment Monitoring Tool" that you can get in the System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Toolkit. If you look in the deployments area and the Enforcement tab, you can look at the DiscoverySourceXML to see what the detection returned. I just found this out today so I haven't been able to fully test it yet. This location could be just the results store for the application discovery process. So far, it's good enough to let me know what product codes work with the SCCM application evaluation process. I really need an SCCM developer to see this and set me straight. 

So I have a number of Type 1 fonts (.PFM & .PFB files) that I am trying to push out to our client machines. After some web searches, here is what I did. 

It really depends on the applications. Supercedence is only really used when the {GUID} changes. This is normally caused by a major version change (version 3 to version 4). A well maintained software title will only update the version number when doing minor updates (v3.0 to v3.1). You will also find that many msi based software titles will install on top of your old version without issue. Now to your question, SCCM has a pre-built report called "Count inventoried products and versions for a specific product". This will report a count of all inventoried versions of a software. You can then use the "Computers with a specific product name and version" to get a list of computers that have old versions. From what I have been able to find for best practices, you want to keep all application packages that are currently in use. Once the software is no longer in your environment, you can retire the package and delete it once you know not having it isn't causing problems. You can also make a folder in your application management section to store old application packages. SCCM uses unique IDs for everything and doesn't really care how you organize your objects. 

If you don't want to do an SCCM task sequence the only other option is to setup a scheduled task with the "At startup" trigger. You still need to perform an SCCM task sequence, but your only step would be to run "schtasks.exe". That would run the task at the next startup. I must warn you in advance that the SCCM option that @newmanth suggested is a better choice in most cases. Scheduled task is more geared towards repetitive tasks that need to happen multiple times a year. Hope this helps 

There are a number of other fonts already installed so you can just mirror the registry settings of another font. 

Copy Font files to C:\Windows\Fonts Modify the proper registry entry: "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts" 

Scheduled Tasks is what you need. You can set a trigger for both workstation lock and workstation unlock. If you need to deploy it out to more machines, use SCHTASKS.EXE (provided with windows). Hope that helps 

Placement of services is more of a thought exercise to come to your own conclusion. My guess based off of the number of printers and the number of servers, is that printing is a low priority service that only a few people manage. If that is the case, it really doesn't matter where you put it. Hope this helps
