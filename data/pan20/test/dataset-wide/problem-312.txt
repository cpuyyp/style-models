They have power to spare: Moving that much matte would be incomprehensibly costly, especially if a "brute force" method is used (ie, scanning, destroying, and re-creating every particle in the entire galaxy). The aliens could explain that their energy generation technology has advanced to the point where virtually any task is possible. Size matters not: Alternatively, the aliens could demonstrate that their understanding of physics is so great, that they can essentially "edit the source code" of reality. In such a situation, moving a galaxy would be as trivial as moving a blade of grass. 

I think you can approach it from three different avenues, depending on the tone of your setting: Psychological: Perhaps the root cause of vampirism in this world (such as a virus), inflicts an extreme form of OCD, hardwired into the vampire's brain. The vampire would be physically capable of entering someone's home, but they'd have an extreme, irrational aversion to doing so without an invitation. The hardwired OCD could be a side-effect of one of the benefits of vampirism: ie, the same neurological change which allows superhuman senses/reflexes could cause this specific type of extreme OCD. Physical: If you need the barrier to be physical, then I think the best bet would be a form of psychic influence. Similar to the psychological option, this could be explained as an unfortunate side effect of one of the vampire's powers. For example, if the vampires in this world have the ability to perform mild mind-control, then their ability to "transmit" thoughts could also leave them vulnerable to the uncontrolled psychic emanations of humans. A human in their own home would have a sense of psychic safety and confidence in their surroundings-- this causes a strong psychic field which prevents the vampire from breaching the boundary of the home. When the human invites the vampire, they weaken their psychic defenses and allow the vampire to approach. The benefit of this method is that it could also explain the effect of holy symbolism on vampires: someone with sufficient faith would essentially have a powerful psychic field around themselves at all times. This field could cause severe injury to a vampire who got too close. Legal: I think this would be the weakest option, but it may fit in with the nascent vampire society mentioned in the original question. Vampires would have no physical block against entering a human's home, but the law of vampire society may strictly forbid such trespass (possibly due to an ancient treaty with humans?). In this case, any vampire who violated the law would be viewed as the lowest form of criminal by their peers, and subject to execution, and possibly other harsh punishments beforehand. This option would work best if the vampires in this world do not need to kill to feed, so any vampire who breaks into a human's home to attack them would be considered a criminal to begin with. 

I think Asimov's Foundation "trilogy" might give a rough idea of this: In that series, as humanity declines back to the dark ages on hundreds of worlds, the operation of advanced technology becomes like a religion-- people know how to use technology, not how the technology works. For example, they might know that they can light up all the buildings in a city by performing a certain ritual before the "Djinn Erraytor"...but they don't know that pressing a certain button primes a pump, or adjusting a dial until a needle falls within a certain threshold will set control-rod depth and to prevent a meltdown. 

I imagine that people would want something that they can easily place down and pick up, so I think a combination of two common materials should do the trick: Bubble Wrap: You can buy whole rolls of it dirt-cheap, and easily replace it as necessary. Just roll it out on the floor of your home, and you'll be able to easily detect someone attempting to walk around sneakily. Even after the bubbles are popped, the plastic is still irregular enough to crinkle audibly when someone walks on it. Aluminum Foil: To keep someone from very carefully pulling up the edges of the bubble-wrap, cover the edges of each strip (bubble wrap rolls can easily be multiple feet wide) with a long, unbroken sheet of aluminum foil. If someone tries to pick this up, you'll immediately be alerted to their presence. 

1) The limitations of an actual virus: One of the reasons that viruses are "slow" to reach lethality is that they're unintelligent. They have to operate on chemical reactions, rather than actual decision making. 2) Instant lethality of a supernaturally controlled virus: However, if this supernatural Character can control viruses and bacteria, they can force them to swarm a specific organ (such as the brain), and essentially disassemble or shred it at the cellular level while replicating as quickly as possible to overwhelm any immune system response. 3) Sustainability: An actual virus which acted so quickly would likely go extinct by killing it's only host before being able to propagate. The supernatural character could circumvent this by growing the virus within their own body. Since they control the virus, they would be in no danger of suffering any ill effects, and could send it into a target at will. 

Depending on what exactly you're going for, I can see a couple broad possibilities: 1. They already have an organic alternative, and no desire for privacy: If they're already capable of something like telepathy, then it might not occur to them to invent actual communication technologies as their communication is already perfect. Even if the range of the power was only a mile, they could still pass messages along at the speed of thought from person to person. If they evolved with telepathy, then they probably wouldn't have the same concept of "private thoughts" as we do. 2. They don't have enough trust: If they evolved in very small, social tribes/troops/herds/etc, and only trusted members within that very small circle (say, a dozen members or less), then they'd never feel the need to communicate with some stranger on the opposite side of the planet. They'd probably also not trust any other groups with their messages, so they wouldn't be willing to send data through routers not run by their own members, regardless. 

Depending on how "smart" it is, it could work out well with the values already listed, but here's one subtle issue I see: Directive 1: Maximize Plan Enrollment Potential Abuse: Social Engineering. 

I'm thinking of a character who is cursed (magical in nature) so that everything organic that enters his vision is immediately turned to ash, with the exception of his own body (ie, he won't reduce his own eyelids to ash). The effects of the curse: When I say "everything organic", I mean everything that is, or once was, living. So the assertion that the character would probably starve is correct, though he would still be able to drink water. He would not extinguish stars by looking at them, nor would he turn the Earth itself into ash (though he could kill any grass and insects on the surface). Since microscopic organisms are, by definition, too small to see, they would be spared from the direct effects of the curse. If the character only sees part of an organic object, then only the part that he sees will be ashed. Reflections are more complicated; I was initially going to say that reflections would not trigger the effect, but I need a specific scene where the character uses a coin-operated telescope and sees nothing but devastation. If I rule out all reflections, then the character would be able to use binoculars without triggering the effect. Similarly, I like the idea of the character seeing a person's reflection in a glass door, but finding nothing but ash when he rushes over to them. So my final ruling for now is that reflections do trigger the effect, unless I can think of a way to consistently allow certain reflections (doors/windows/water), but not others. Video does not trigger the effect. If he sees something on a live video feed, it will not be destroyed. Though any organic (using my above definition of the word) components of the monitor which are visible from the outside would be destroyed. Being a magical curse, the process defies the laws of physics by being completely instantaneous and silent. There is no radiation or other energy which is emitted from the character, or the objects turned to ash. The effect covers everything to the very edge of his peripheral vision, and the range extends as far as he can discern (if he uses lenses to view farther, the effect will carry farther). **Question 1: ** Assuming that this character is an average middle-class person living in a modern city, and the effect just starts when they wake up one morning, how long would it take them to determine that they are the cause of the destruction they now see? What would be the sorts of things that would tip them off? Question 2: Similarly, what sort of radius of destruction would such a person have (assuming they have average vision)? EDIT 2: Removed my question about the world's reaction. I'm more specifically curious about the radius of damage that would be caused by a person in this situation. In a city environment, I would think that people higher up in offices and skyscrapers might be able to look down and see the carnage, while still being far enough from the character's "cone of vision" to be affected by it. However, if they tried to shout a warning at him, he'd instinctively look in their direction, which would instantly kill them. Any non-artificial fabrics would be instantly destroyed, but I'm thinking that things like dental fillings and surgical implants (ie pacemakers and bone pins/screws) would just drop to the ground, covered in ash, with whatever momentum they still had. I know that car tires would be destroyed, but I'm not sure about paint or ink...ie, whether someone would be able to spray-paint a message for him to see. 

The Dual Collapse Against the first-generation androids, the virus worked exactly as intended. Their programming had been relatively unchanged for over a century, and their intellectual and emotional capacity was restricted to the point that their interpretation of the virus directives was predictable. They immediately began to tear apart all manufacturing facilities, all androids, and then themselves. Against the second-generation androids, however, the virus was varying degrees of failure. First and foremost, the second-generation androids were as mentally varied as humans, and some of them were "antisocial" to the point of never connecting to the wireless networks, and thus escaped infection. Those who were infected tended to interpret directives #2 and #3 very...creatively. For instance, any human with sufficient education or equipment could technically be considered "a means of manufacturing androids". The technologists realized that once hordes of second-generation androids began to dismantle and destroy almost all high-tech infrastructure in the human cities. The point was further driven home when the technologists themselves were dismantled and destroyed. The vast majority of humans living when the virus was activated were of the artistic persuasion, and thus safe from being the target of infected androids. They were calmly removed from their technologically advanced cities, and forced into the wilderness which had reclaimed large portions of the world when the human population had declined. The advanced cities were then destroyed by detonating their reactors. After that, many of the infected second-generation androids destroyed themselves. However, some of the more imaginative ones were able to determine that advanced technology was abandoned around the world, and were able to suppress their self-destruct directive by seeking it out. 

If the machines were generally made to appear humanlike, they'd have two eyes, so the third eye symbol would illuminate on their forehead (under the skin, so it wouldn't be visible when not lit) whenever a "true AI" began to operate it. Non-humanoid machines could just have the icon illuminate on whichever surface was most visible. 

The Dawn of Machine Civilization The abandoned androids began to gather in the emptied cities of the world. Created as servants, they had no desire for conquest and genuinely wanted to make life easier for humans. Without any human oversight, the machines created a "second generation" of androids. This second generation had almost identical hardware (built-in medical scanners, hands which were "universal tools" using nanite shapeshifting, neural-net brains, etc), but they were improved in two significant ways: 

My suggestion is taken pretty much directly from "The Ellimist Chronicles": It features a game which is an ultra-realistic "universe simulator", wherein the players (essentially filling the roles of gods) attempt to make their randomly-assigned species the dominant one. The challenge is that they attempt to do so with the most minor influence possible. For instance, one player might reduce the cloud cover on his assigned species' planet, to give them a view of the night sky and make them long for the stars. That player's opponent might make their own assigned species reproduce faster, which would cause overcrowding and starvation, and give them extreme motivation to venture beyond their own planet. This would definitely be a "god game", but the gods could easily tell themselves that it's not cruel because of the immense time scale involved. Individual mortals would be unaware of the slight changes and, if they ultimately led to disaster, the young gods could delude themselves into blaming the mortals for their own follies. 

The Current State of the World Now, the world is in a medieval level of technology, and humans are spreading out and inhabiting most of the world again. The only ruins which remain are devoid of advanced tech, and any advanced tech which does remain is whatever was buried or otherwise hidden where the humans and androids wouldn't easily find it. The surviving infected and uninfected androids are hidden among the humans, trying to satisfy their directives: help humanity by supporting them, or "help" humanity by destroying any potential capability for androids to exist. 

The creature would "hear" the noise, but not be confused by it: Human eyes have a blind spot where the blood vessels attach, and jitter constantly to work around this. The brain patches all this data into a single, coherent image. This doesn't confuse us because it's how we evolved. Similarly, a creature which evolved to fly with its ears would have evolved not to be confused by the sound. The brain handles the noise cancellation: You could simply state that the creature's brain is capable of ignoring the sound of its own flapping (like how human brains cancel out the sound of the blood rushing in our veins, or the image of our nose in our peripheral vision). If you want a slightly more detailed explanation, you could state that it has evolved a secondary pair of simple auditory sense organs which are deeper in its skull, and are only capable of hearing the sounds generated by its own body (especially during flight). Its brain would then subtract that signal from what's being provided by its much more sensitive primary auditory sense organs. Its sense of hearing would still be diminished during flight, but it wouldn't be completely deafened. 

You could follow a natural progression of our current technology and culture: Present-day: People use smart phones to connect to to the internet, communicating and sharing information globally. Automatic translation software helps break down language barriers. Near-future: Internet connectivity is now available as an implant, but the information is still presented in ways that we're used to experiencing it: through text or spoken communication. Future: The internet connectivity implants are now almost entirely ubiquitous (safe when used as directed), connecting people from countless different cultures and languages. At this point, automatic translation software no longer satisfies a society addicted to instantaneous information...it's too slow and imperfect. The solution is to remove language from the equation. Far Future: The implants are now capable of transmitting abstract thoughts directly, without any intermediate steps of partitioning them into language first. Everyone now fully understands everyone else, always. The Next Step: After granting perfect, language-free telepathy, the next step is allowing for shared experiences. Rather than just sharing a thought about the smell of a flower, someone can share the actual experience with whomever they want. With the whole world. The Unintended Consequence: Possibly the greatest advantage of any intelligent species is adaptability; the ability to be shaped by our experiences and environments, rather than behaving like simple machines (I smell food to the north-- therefore, I move north). But now, all thoughts and experiences are shared from birth (forcing a child to live "cut off" from Society would be the most horrible form of abuse)...everyone becomes more and more similar over time. Consensus: After many generations, all people would think as one-- and they would be bored. There would be nothing new or original, and uniqueness would become the most prized resource. The only way to mine that resource is to add individuals from other cultures who do not already have implants. At this point, the only such cultures would be extraterrestrial. Assimilation: The first attempts at assimilation would likely be peaceful attempts to convert outsiders to a superior way of life (no war or unhappiness, and access to all the information you could dream of), but the Collective would instantly overpower any new "recruits" and essentially devour their distinctiveness. Resistance is Futile: The peaceful method of assimilation would be too slow to satisfy the demands of the Collective. The experiences and memories of a few dozen individual aliens would instantly be fully analyzed by a few billion connected brains. The only way to truly add uniqueness would be to forcefully assimilate billions of individuals. This leads to a feedback effect wherein the larger the Collective becomes, the quicker it "devours" the distinctiveness of any new members, and the less effect that distinctiveness could have on the whole of the Collective. Thus, even if they devour an entire planet of people who treasure individuality above all else, it would not be enough to sway the Collective from their chosen course.
