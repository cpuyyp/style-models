It's hard to tell if it will be OK, and it will depend on how heavy you are and how much pedaling torque you can produce. The main problem you are going to face is not the reduction in area of the taper surface, but that the puller will have pushed the edges of the gouged area up, so that the crank will not fit quite properly on the spindle taper. Because of this you may find that you have problems with the crank staying on the spindle. If you feel inside the taper with a finger tip (my pinkie fits inside a crank taper, and I have fairly big hands) you will feel an raised edge or 'burr' of material around the gouged area. You will want to very carefully file that off with a fine, flat needle file. It will only take a few light strokes to remove it. When you re-install the crank, torque the retaining bolt up to the maximum allowed. Do a test ride and check that the crank is staying in place. Check the crank regularly when you ride after that. Hopefully it will stay in place. 

The easiest thing to do of course is simply take it to a bike shop. You'll get the correct part and the gears set up and adjusted properly. If you want to obtain a replacement yourself, you can order a replacement Tourney TX from an online bike components store, however, there are several variations of Tourney derailleurs available you need to take account of. Schwinn does not seem to list any info for the Ranger 24" model but looking at some online retailers that are offering it, it's a 7 speed, uses a direct derailleur mount and seems to have a medium cage length. Target.com lists a Ranger 24" here: $URL$ That bike seems to have a Tourney TX35D model derailleur. You'll want to check that the bike at Target looks like yours as it may not be the exactly same as what you have. Niagara Cycle has a good selection of Tourney TX derailleurs available (and TY, which appears to be a slight upgrade). You should be able to find something that matches the mount style (hanger or direct), number of speeds (I'm fairly sure all Tourneys are 6 or 7 speeds) and cage length that you need. If you are not in the UK, Canada or Australia you should be able to find the correct model on Amazon.com or another online retailer. 

If you run out of adjustment in the barrel adjuster you will have to re-clamp the cable on the derailleur. 

The best advice to give you I think is go and test ride lots of bikes. All good stores will be perfectly happy to let you do that. Try a few different styles including some more road oriented hybrid bikes to find out how the different geometry feels. Let the bike store staff give you guidance on sizing - which may be different for different styles or brands of bikes. Some mountain bikes may feel small because they have low top tubes and lots of standover clearance, and handlebars that a relatively high and close to the seat for rough trail riding. Just a note about mountain bikes at the inexpensive end of the price range: they tend to have cheap suspension forks which are more cosmetic than functional and add lots of weight; and are definitely not required for on-road riding. 

The added picture (thanks) shows that the wheel is misaligned in the fork dropouts. This is an easy fix. (It's highly unlikely that the wheel was bent in a low speed crash.) If you have a quick-release on the front wheel, just hold the bike upright, undo the release, the wheel axle should drop into the dropouts, then re-secure the release. If the wheel moved in the fork, it's likely that the quick-release was not done up tightly enough. There are many YouTube videos that show how to adjust them properly. Here is a good one. If the wheel is secured with axle nuts, your bike shop can help. A good shop will likely do such a small task for free. 

The actual width of a mounted tire will depend on the width of the rim it is mounted on. Different manufactures presumably use a 'nominal' rim width for each tire width, which they do not quote, so the stated tire width is at best a guide. 

Re finding a replacement frame. New bare frame sets tend to be high end models. You could look on the used market for an older good quality frame, but you would have to educate yourself about geometry and component compatibility. Itâ€™s not impossible but not trivial. Then factor in the tools you would need to buy to do a full bike build, and components that might need replacing such as the chain, cassette etc. You will almost certainly be better off buying new bike, and getting the benefit of brand new components. If you want some value out of the bike, strip its components and sell them - or donate the bike to a local co-operative or bike charity as a component donor. 

You may simply not pushing the pump onto the value body enough, and the internal valve is not being opened. Most pumps have a plastic insert behind the valve hole that is reversible for Schrader or Presta value use. 

It's almost certainly going to be more cost effective to replace the whole bike, and selling the current one. There are potential problems with both brake caliper and derailleur compatibility going to flat bar shifters. Aside from replacing shifters, drivetrain and bar, drop bar road bikes have shorter frames than flat bar bikes, because the rider's hands are placed forward of the stem head on the drops or hoods, but a flat bar places them approximately level with stem head. You may find the seat to bar distance is too short with flat bar installed. 

Just because you let your pads get too far worn down does not mean you are automatically going to screw up replacing them. Hydraulic disc brake pad replacement is reasonably simple: 

At this level, just simply riding the bike regularly will increase your fitness, stamina and speed. You may want to took for advice on going from no exercise to regular moderate exercise to avoid injury. There may be a few things you can do to make things a little easier for you. 1) Make sure your seat height is set correctly. This has a big impact on efficiency. If you bought your bike at a store they should have set this up for you. Here's an article that you can check out. 2) Make sure your tires are pressurized correctly. You will probably want to inflate your tires to the maximum specified (it's written on the side of each tire) for lowest rolling resistance when riding on paved surfaces. 3) Use your gears. Proper use of gears can make things substantially easier. You may find yourself going slower, but at a level of effort you can sustain for longer. There are numerous 'gears for beginners' articles and videos available such as this. 

Cranks need to match the bottom bracket bearing type. Different bottom bracket types have different spindle lengths and diameters. The Affine FC-S500 crank is designed to work with a Shimano Hollowtech II external bearing bottom bracket in a threaded 68mm wide frame shell (known as 'English' or 'BSA'). You can directly replace the crank with any that is compatible with that bottom bracket bearing and shell width. Unfortunately this does not leave you many choices as you need a Shimano 42 tooth single chainring crank. I believe the FC-S500 is Shimano's only offering that matches. An alternative is to replace the both the crank and the bottom bracket bearing. There are many crank/bearing combinations compatible with a 68mm threaded shell. Replacement Affine cranks are readily available in my location (US). When you say 'This crankset is very hard to find online' I assume you mean on sites that offer it for sale in your location. You might want to check that the spindle is really damaged. It is steel and the crank is softer aluminum alloy. If the crank was slipping off the spindle the majority of the damage would have been on the crank. You may be able to just replace the left crank arm. Also, if you do replace the crank you will be able to re-use the chainring, so you do not have to find a replacement crank with a 42 tooth ring. Reiterating a point from Batman's answer: it's probably best to let a bike repair shop replace the crank and/or bottom bracket as special tools are needed, and a torque wrench should be used to avoid the crank slipping off the spindle again. 

From what you describe, it seems that pushing the derailleur inwards manually to get it onto the largest sprocket was tightening the shifter cable - that is suspicious, it should have loosened the cable. First thing to do is disconnect the shift cable from the derailleur and check three things: 

Sorry, that frame will not take larger wheels. Triathlon/aero bikes have minimal clearance between frame/fork and wheels which do not even allow larger tires in some cases. Additionally, bikes equipped with rim brakes will not take different size wheels because the brakes will not line up with the rims. The assertion about smaller bikes needing smaller wheels to maintain geometry is true. An XS size sounds too small for someone 167cm (5'4 1/2"). As you bought it used you may want to consider selling it and looking for a bike the next size up. 

You get to choose what size cassette you want. The derailleur has to be able to accommodate the largest sprocket on the cassette and have a sufficiently high total tooth difference capacity (difference in teeth biggest-smallest sprockets in cassette + difference in teeth biggest-smallest chainrings). If your derailleur can take a wide range cassette, what you may choose to do is only use one or two (if your bike is a triple) chainrings, in which case the derailleur only needs to handle the total tooth difference capacity of the chainrings you are using. You will want to disable front shifting into the chainrings you are not using to prevent accidentally wrecking the rear derailleur. 

In general it depends on the road or trail, how wide it is, how straight or twisty, how visible the trail ahead is etc. On a wide trail without tight turns and plenty of forward visibility riding two-abreast is fine. On a narrower trail with tighter turns or less visibility, riders should ride single-file and stay on their side of the trail. Common sense applies to overtaking, i.e., don't try to pass if you can't see far enough ahead. There may be laws that apply to cyclists in different locations of course. 

Yes. A 700c rim with a 23"mm tire is under 28" in diameter. The max tire width is specified at 40mm. The "28inch" spec is a bit confusing as it's not a common wheel size (700c, 29" etc). I'm guessing a 700c rim with a 40mm tire is about 28" in diameter. 

Forks are not a 'wear component' that need to be replaced periodically. Bicycle frame makes are clever enough to make their products sufficiently durable and it's not something riders generally need to worry about. That said there obviously are instances of frames and forks cracking and failing, but this is not the norm. However, in your particular case, with an old steel frame, it's a good idea to periodically inspect it for any cracks that might be developing in any of the welded or brazed joints. On the fork you should look for cracks near the fork crown as that is where forces are highest. As as aside, I haven't tried to put the document through Google translate yet, but there may be a slight misunderstanding. I think perhaps you are interpreting it as: bicycle forks commonly fail, leading to injury, when perhaps that should be if a bicycle's fork fails, injury is common. Personally, I've never seen or heard of a modern bicycle fork catastrophically failing in regular use (crashes and extreme mountain bike riding are another matter).
