I suspect you'll be buying a whole new crankset. You may also need to upgrade the bottom bracket as there's not much choice of upgrades if you're starting with square taper parts. My hybrid had a very similar drivetrain, including suntour cranks/chainrings which were riveted together. You've already got a fairly wide ratio cassette for an 8 speed (I run the shimano equivalent) so you might struggle to get the range you need. Perhaps something like 11-34 (the widest range I've seen on 8 speed) with a 32-36 tooth chainring would do it. 8 speed casettes are cheap and consumable so swapping out to get the extra bottom end might help you. The alternative of going for a full 1x9 system would of course mean a new shifter and probably cable. You should probably make up a spreadsheet of all the gear ratios you have/use and those you'd get in your 1x8 suggestion. And you can try running just in your middle chainring to see how much too hard 38 is. The actual weight saving though, on a hybrid which probably has a heavy frame, is unlikely to be worth it, every assuming better/lighter cranks to go with the reduced chainring weight. 

I would replace the tyre even if it's not the cause of the puncture as the bead is coming away. I'd do it reasonably quickly but I would take the risk of riding home or to the bike shop on it. Do you know if this bit of the tyre was anywhere near the punctures? I put the manufacturer's logo next to the valve when I fit a tyre to make working this out easier. By the way, tubes can take a lot of stretch. I've seen a 24" tube survive on a 26" wheel. 

A google reverse image search tells me it's a Martone Sweetzer (US) or Real (European version). $URL$ From certain features of the frame (the bend in the top tube etc.) I'd say that's the same bike, but that your picture is of a slightly customised version with a different saddle and grips. 

It's worth dealing with these before considering a fitting, as that's based on the assumption that you will stay in the optimal position the fitting identifies. For a commuter and especially on flat bars it's also worth doing a self fit, getting used to the conditions and then deciding whether the fit is good enough and whether the bike is suitable including luggage. There's so much more to deal with than if your riding involves picking a nice route and going out on a road bike with just a bottle of water and a banana. 

The answer in terms of ratios might not be the same as the answer in terms of being able to shift. Taking out the 16 would be reasonable but then the shift ramps and pickup teeth wouldn't align. This issue will occur going from the 23 to the 26 whatever you remove. You've got 8 gears in the back so I assume you've got indexed shifting. If you're using friction shifters it's not an issue as you can overshift then back it off. Further reading from Sheldon Brown 

Back wheels with hub motors weigh a lot. The battery will also add weight behind the front wheel. The whole bike sounds light for an electric model though (is that definitely the weight with the battery?) Combined, this will make lifting the back wheel much harder than it otherwise would be. While the wheelbase is short, your weight is also quite a lot way back. I've my locked my front wheel twice in 40000km of riding. Both times were on wet leaves on tarmac. It's just not something you do, so it's not a good test. I have ridden an e-bike with poor front (disc) brakes. A little more back brake than on a normal bike was the only adjustment needed, similar to riding with a rear child seat. In both cases the extra weight means that back doesn't skid. But v brakes with good pads should be able to stop the bike as hard as you're prepared to risk in terms of not skidding the front or going over the bars. After all, they were standard on MTBs until discs became affordable. I've never seen good pads on v-brakes when the bike is shipped. I upgraded mine to XLC dual compound, with much more stopping power (quite cheap on ebay). I've since gone for some Kool Stop dual compound pads because the XLCs were wearing out too quickly. 

The upright sitting position of a comfort bike is likely to make it slower - even at the speeds we're talking about air drag is relevant, and it's not a position designed for efficient power transfer. You're going to need a good test ride on the right sort of roads, ideally measuring your speed, if you're going to get something in the sweet spot between speed and riding position. 

For commuting with panniers and/or a toddler seat, I've settled on the front fork for the D-lock, mainly because little else fits there and I'm restricted by cables and tube diameters elsewhere. Having that 1.5kg forwards also helps the handling with a heavy back load. Don't forget that a heavy lock is only around 2% of a rider's weight - it has to be a long way from the centre of mass to be noticeable for handling. A cable lock will often fit in a spare bottle holder. I actually use the down tube holder for this, and the seat tube one for my bottle. But I'm usually in stop-start conditions (for longer rides I use both bottle holders for bottles). My pump actually fits under the down tube with around 10mm clearance to the mudguard. My puncture kit (including for humans) and other tools go in a small triangular bag in the front of the frame. A saddle bag doesn't fit with the toddler seat. I'm lucky in that I normally lock up somewhere I'm happy to leave tools and lights on the bike. As for convention, if there is one I ignore it. Personal preference combined with quirks of bike design are much more important. 

Once you've taken it to bits, clean all the muck and loose rust off the parts, the grease and reassemble. The bolt should be tight. You'll probably need to do the other arm as well, and may need to adjust the return spring screws. Obviously don't get grease or greasy hands on the pads. 

Even if you've only got around 300W, that should shift you reasonably well on the level. The limit here is 250W and that can manage 15mph with your weight on the bike, though the acceleration isn't great. But the current draw with no load (on a stand) will be a lot less than the loaded current anyway, so you probably can get the rated power or close to it. I assume it's actually rated to 1kW at 48V The motor controller is important - is that suitable for over 20A? Is your wiring? 

The expense is part of it: for the price of a cheap electric bike I can buy a much better bike without a motor. A much bigger effect is that electric bikes are still bikes, with all the exposure to the weather, perceived risk, and at least some of the effort. So tempting people out of their cars onto electric bikes is a hard sell. Tax breaks might help but would have to be significant given the upfront cost. Electric bikes are generally too expensive for schemes like the UK bike to work scheme. Getting people who ride normal bikes onto electric bikes means starting from a small number of people in the first place, and again you've got the upfront cost plus they're not much quicker than pedal bikes in many places due to legal restrictions. 

The straps are probably the best bit. You should be able to reassemble them into a short luggage strap perhaps to use with panniers or a rucksack. If any removable pads have survived wear and tear up to now, they might fit your replacement, and a spare set of pads is a good thing for when the other pads are destinking (mine need a periodic soak in bleach). I keep an old (but not visibly damaged) helmet under my desk in work, because I also keep a bike near work and in theory could end up wanting to use it and not having my current helmet. The shape and size are too awkward for many potential uses - while you could probably make one into a lunch bag or something it would take more materials than it's worth. I wondered about keeping it as a jig or stand foe use when tinkering with helmet-mounted lights or cameras (something I do more than most people) but helmets are all different and what mounts securely on one won't necessarily work on another. You may have recycling for the foam in your area if you can get the outer shell off. 

I can only say "probably not" as while I've borrowed an e-bike a few times for rides similar to my current commute, it doesn't really suit me and doesn't come close to spoiling my normal riding. Commuting is quite different to riding for fun and most pedelecs are quite heavy and handle very differently. You may even find that your regular bike feels more nimble (though I'm basing this on uprights not recumbents). If you're in Europe (or at least most of it) the motor is required by law to cut out above 25km/h -- which isn't very fast. Similar rules apply in some other countries. Given stopping and starting you'd be unlikely to make your 40km in under 2 hours, which you could probably do on the recumbent under the same conditions. A few things to watch out for: 

Just living off that stuff requires your digestive system to adjust, so if you try it you should build it into your diet well in advance, and as a major component. Don't forget to take into account how much extra you need compared to a typical lifestyle. It can't really save you any weight compared to other dehydrated foods, as a gram of carbs is a gram of carbs (same for protein or fat) , but it might save you some bulk compared to something like ramen (with whey powder drinks on the side). For all dehydrated (i.e. lightweight) options access to water is critical. A further thought is that if we accept that these are perfect/balanced/complete nutrition as they claim, then complete for what? Your energy needs when touring will go up (assuming you're ordinarily fairly sedentary), but not all your micronutrient needs will (to some extent your body can adjust these), and fibre could go either way. Sodium needs will depend on how much you sweat, which in turn depends on you and the climate as well as the effort level. On the other hand I was reading recently about a solo tour on remote roads fuelled by ramen. Even though he didn't really have enough, I got the impression he was sick of the stuff after a week. There are advantages to these products: they don't need cooking, saving time and fuel. In the extreme case that could mean not carrying a stove or cooking pans (prepare it in your water bottle). However in most climates I reckon most people would want the ability to have a hot meal or hot drink, and if you're relying on finding water, boiling it is a good idea (though I'm told that unflavoured Huel is disgusting, maybe water treatment tablets would improve the flavour!). Overall I can see a role for them as part of a diet plan, so long as you've got good access to water and get on with them. 

If you're going to buy a tube to carry, you'd be better off getting something that fits properly. You don't want to push the limits of your tube (e.g. burst it when you first inflate it) if you're a long walk from anything else, and the extra bulk/weight isn't much. Also fitting a tube at the side of the trail isn't easy especially in bad weather (and punctures wait for bad weather to catch you out). So I would buy one tube for both 27.5" bikes (e.g. a 2.2--2.5" width) and one for the 29", then carry the right one rather than wrestle with a 26". You've got 3 MTBs so cost isn't an issue. A tube for 1.3" width in a 2.5" tyre is stretched to twice its intended size, so it will be half as thick. If you're also stretching it in the other dimension it's even worse. (All slightly approximate). That said, tubes are very stretchy. I've seen 24" tubes in 26" tyres. I've run slightly too thin tubes for months on end. In an emergency you can get away with pretty much anything that you can get to fit. But if you're planning, plan to do it right.
