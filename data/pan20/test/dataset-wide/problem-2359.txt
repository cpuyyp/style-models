If it "easily came out of the rock," then it was at best useless and at worst a safety hazard, because of the possibility that someone might naively trust it. Removing it was a public service. 

When I'm setting up for a belay, I first clip the belay device to my belay loop using the keeper wire, then feed the rope through, then open the carabiner and put it through the rope. This is a pretty dependable way of doing the process without dropping the belay device, which could be a bad thing. If you removed the keeper wire, you'd have to keep one hand gripping the belay device at all times while fumbling with the other hand to complete the setup. I think you'd be much more likely to drop your belay device. 

I had never actually done the math until today, but here's how #1 and #2 seem to work out. Let's say the distance between clips is 1 unit. You climb past your most recent clip until your hips are x units above it, and then you reach for the next clip. As you reach for that next clip, the amount of rope you have out past the last clip is 1+(1-x)=2-x. If you miss the clip and fall, you're going to fall x until your hips are at the last clip, and then another 2-x, plus rope stretch, so the total is 2. In other words the length of the fall is exactly the same regardless of x. In the gym, where the quickdraws are evenly spaced, every fall that you make while attempting to clip is a fall of twice the distance between quickdraws (not counting rope stretch). If your last clip was at a height h above the ground, then the fall factor is 2/(h+2-x). This is actually bigger (worse) if you climb higher before clipping. When the rope first comes up taut at the bottom of your fall, you're at a height h-(2-x)=h-2+x. This is higher if you climb higher before clipping, and that makes you less likely to hit the deck with rope stretch. So it sounds like: (1) If you're in doubt about hitting the deck, it's safer to clip from a position as high as possible. (2) If you're in doubt about your belayer's ability to hold a high-fall-factor fall (or if you're climbing trad and in doubt about whether your last piece will hold), it's safer to clip from a position as low as possible. Does this make sense? Are there factors I'm leaving out? 

There's one good way to make sure that your crampons last forever and are completely safe against failure in the field, which is to leave them in a closet and never use them. Assuming that you are going to use them, you can try to avoid walking on bare rocks in them. Walking on rocks will dull the points and will also stress the metal by repeatedly bending and flexing it. Falling on your crampons can be particularly damaging. Black diamond says that when they get crampons returned with broken points, it's normally the front points. Of course, sometimes in mixed conditions it's impractical to take your crampons off and put them back on repeatedly, and this will entail a certain amount of wear on them. For mixed conditions, consider bring Microspikes either in addition to or as an alternative to crampons. Don't endanger your safety by failing to put on your crampons just because it's a pain to keep putting them on and taking them off; if you need them in a certain spot, you need them. Crampons need to be sharpened periodically. To do this, you need to buy what's known as a mil bastard file. (The term refers to the roughness of the file.) When you buy a file in a hardware store, it has a bare spike, which is meant to be inserted into a handle. If you don't have a handle, you can hold the file by the spike. Hold the handle or spike in your right hand, and put your left hand on the far end of the file. Point the edge of the crampon's claw toward yourself, and stroke away from yourself, so that you're stroking away from the edge. Don't go back and forth with the file; only stroke away from yourself. If you have a card (i.e., a brush), you can use it periodically to clean the tiny bits of steel out of the teeth of the file. I haven't figured out a good way to clamp the crampons while working on them, although it sort of works if I attach them to my boots and then try to keep the boot still. While sharpening your crampons, visually inspect them for cracks. Rust is not a safety concern in and of itself, but it will accelerate wear on the teeth, which will force you to sharpen them more often and shorten the lifetime of the crampons. Sharpening will automatically get rid of some rust. If possible, dry your crampons after use, but of course in real-world conditions this may be impossible. If you have to walk along roads that have been salted, try to get the salt off as soon as possible. Some crampons are made of stainless steel, which is less susceptible to rust than the standard chromoly steel. If there's still a lot of rust left after you sharpen the points, you may choose to try to remove it, but this isn't critical. To do this, try working on the steel with oil and a mildly abrasive tool. The abrasive could be fine-grit sandpaper, a crumpled piece of aluminum foil, or steel wool. It doesn't really matter what kind of oil you use. Various people online describe using bike oil, olive oil, WD-40, motor oil, PAM vegetable-oil spray, gun oil, or linseed oil. Ideally the oil should be penetrating (like WD-40) and hydrophobic. Whatever type of oil you use, watch out for damaging your boots, straps, or the plastic parts of the bindings. When you're putting your crampons away in the spring, you can also protect them from rust by coating the areas where the paint has been scraped off with a thin layer of oil, wiping off the excess with a cloth. The BD article says that the maximum lifespan of crampons is 5 years, and less than that if you use them heavily. I wouldn't take this seriously, since I don't know anybody who replaces them that often. They may be saying this in order to increase sales and avoid lawsuits. I met a guy on Mt. Baldy who had a pair of antique crampons from the late 19th century. They had been carefully taken care of and seemed to be in great shape. Here is an REI article about crampon maintenance: $URL$ 

If we're talking about 6 mm nylon cord, not your spare shoelace, then this is a total non-issue. You can't break 6 mm cord with body weight. E.g., the 6 mm PMI cord I use is rated at 7.5 kN, which is equivalent to 760 kg or 1700 pounds. You have so much extra strength there that it's simply not an issue. And in the self-rescue situation you describe, if you escape the belay correctly, the Prusik is never the only thing preventing the climber from falling. 

The diagram shows three situations that are easy to understand without knowing a lot of math or physics. 

Sometimes when I'm trad climbing it seems really tough to avoid an awkward belay, and a common type of awkwardness is when the belay device ends up too low. Below is a drawing of a situation I was in recently. 

This sounds like the blogger didn't understand thermodynamics very well. The rate at which heat flows out of an object by conduction into its colder surroundings is proportional to its surface area and to the temperature difference. When you surround your body with a sleeping bag, the rate of heat flow by conduction is also inversely proportional to the thickness of the bag. Having a bladder full of pee at body temperature doesn't affect any of these three variables, so heat will flow at the same rate when your bladder is full. However, when your bladder is full, it will add slightly to the amount of heat energy that your body starts with, so heat loss at the same rate will produce a slower drop in temperature. In reality I would expect this to be a small effect. We could also worry about heat transfer by convection or radiation, but I don't think it changes the conclusion. Your body does not, of course, spend the whole night coming into thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. It probably maintains its core temperature at close to nominal body temperature, but body parts like skin and fingers will get colder. Your body is probably in a steady state of heat flow for most of the night, with its metabolic heating staying in equilibrium with heat loss. I don't think this alters the conclusions, because the rate of heat loss is still governed by factors that are pretty much the same as in the description above for something just passively cooling. 

Most important reason to pee before you go to bed: you'll be uncomfortable lying there all night feeling like you have to pee. Second most important reason: if you try to delay it, you'll just have to get up later, in the middle of the night. This means getting out of the bag and getting cold. The REI blog sounds scientifically illiterate to me and does not appear to be backed up by a citation of any scientific source or any experimental evidence or valid theoretical argument. 

One of the justifications traditionally offered for heavy boots is that they gave ankle support, and some people felt that they needed the ankle support when carrying a heavy pack or on particularly rough terrain such as talus. Many people, however, do just fine in these conditions with running shoes. It's true that when crossing talus, boots will make you less vulnerable to an injury from a heavy rock that hits your ankle from the side or that falls on your toe. 

In a fall, roughly the same load is applied at every point along the rope, at the climber's harness, and at the anchor. "Roughly" means that this is an approximation where rope drag is negligible, the mass of the rope is negligible, and we're not taking into account the geometry of a redundant anchor. (If the anchor is equalized, the load could be shared by the different pieces, but if the angles aren't favorable, the load could be increased.) The fall factor and the maximum load are not independent parameters. WP has a formula that expresses the maximum load in terms of the climber's body mass and the fall factor. Since people's body masses are all on the same order of magnitude, the fall factor almost completely determines the maximum load. Physically, the maximum load is probably the most relevant thing that determines what bad things will happen to the rope, climber, and gear. (It's also possible that total energy dissipation could make a difference.) But since maximum load is essentially determined by fall factor, all you really have to worry about is a single number, which is the fall factor. This is good, because fall factors are easy to estimate while climbing, but it's not practical to estimate while you're climbing how big the dynamic load will be from a lead fall. 

This is not a complete answer but is just my attempt to analyze, after discussion with ShemSeger, the issue of what the Munter does for you as opposed to a Prusik. It seems that there are several different possible modes of failure: 

Here's a scenario I was faced with recently. We do a climb that involves going up to a mountain hut and sleeping there the night before summit day. There is no snow at the hut to melt for drinking water, so we have to carry up all our drinking water. This is in Mexico (on Iztaccihuatl), so we're buying water in bottles. Temperatures at the hut are forecast to be below freezing. On the night before summit day, we can sleep with water bottles inside our sleeping bags to keep them from freezing. But on summit day, we need to leave most of our water at the hut, to which we'll return. Although we can leave these bottles inside sleeping bags and hope they won't freeze, we can't count on that, so the expectation is that when we get back to the hut, all of our water is frozen. In this type of situation, what good techniques are there for getting the water unfrozen? The best plan I was able to come up with was the following. Bring up a plastic bucket. Before heading up on summit day, remember to pour out some water into a pan, and more into the bucket. When we get back to the hut, melt the frozen water in the pan, then use an ice ax to chop more ice out of the bucket and melt that as well. (A variation on this plan would have been to not use a bucket, but use hot water in the pan to thaw out the frozen water bottles, by dunking the water bottles in the hot water. I think this might have been much too slow, however.) I didn't actually get a chance to try this plan, because conditions changed. (A big storm came in, and dropped a lot of snow at the hut, but the storm also prevented us from doing the climb.) [EDIT] Some of the answers and comments have talked about using big pots, building campfires, and hanging things from above. My question is about mountaineering, so none of that is applicable. We're above tree line, and the heat source is a stove. Although in this particular situation we might have been able to hang things from above (because we were going to be in a mountain hut), that would not be possible in general. 

This is a joke. Using a bear canister, on the other hand, is reasonable and in fact legally required in some national parks in the US. But what you're seeing is probably not so much a difference between central Europe and the US as a difference between areas that have a lot of problem bears and areas that don't. Certain specific places in the US, such as Yosemite Valley, are highly concentrated hot spots of bears that are habituated to humans and human food. Although the legal rules about bear canisters may apply to wider areas such as all of Yosemite National Park, in reality if you go 10 miles away from the hot spot in a random direction you will probably be in a backcountry area that doesn't have a significant problem with human-bear interactions. (No toothpaste in tents is just common sense. A bear will perceive the smell of toothpaste as the smell of food.) 

This blog has a discussion of the slip-slap-slide and PBUS techniques for taking in rope when belaying. Here is a video demonstrating PBUS. Slip-slap-slide is illustrated on p. 161 of Freedom of the Hills, 8th ed. I use PBUS, and as the blog discusses, it's becoming almost universal now to teach beginners PBUS. 95% of the people I climb with use it. This can create some issues if I'm climbing with someone who uses slip-slap-slide, because I have a hard time telling if they're doing it properly. If they're experienced, that's fine, but sometimes I'm climbing with people who seem like beginners, and I want to be able to detect whether they're doing slip-slap-slide wrong. (1) Can anyone point us to an online video that shows a correct slip-slap-slide belay? Searching on those keywords on youtube didn't quickly turn up anything for me. (2) Can anyone describe any common mistakes that beginners make with slip-slap-slide? One thing I'm not clear on from the diagram in FotH (which is an overhead view) is during which parts of the cycle the brake hand is up in the air rather than down by the leg. 

When you're on your back, you don't need to get your crampons in the air. The front points are what would snag, and they're pointing at the sky. Even if you wanted to keep the heels of your crampons off the snow (which isn't necessary), you really couldn't, because your knees don't bend that way, and it's not practical to raise your legs at the hips in this situation. To roll, throw your weight to the side, as if you were rolling out of bed. The direction to roll is the one that heads the pick toward the snow like an arrow. Once you start rolling over, you can bend your knees to keep the front points of your crampons off the snow. All of this is theoretical and idealized. It's how you should practice it in order to get it in your muscle memory. But in reality it may not actually work out this way, and in a real self-arrest you may actually need to use your front points -- if that's what it takes to keep from going over a cliff, that's what you do. 

I haven't seen any evidence that one brand or model of handheld GPS unit differs from any other model in its random or systematic errors. As far as I understand, the errors are determined by (1) the geometry of the satellites currently in the visible part of the sky from your location, and (2) the physics of the propagation of the radio waves (including effects such as multipath, ionospheric refraction, attenuation through forest canopy, ...). These effects can be reduced with techniques like dual-frequency GPS and differential GPS, but those features aren't available in hand-held GPS units, only in units such as those intended for use by surveyors. What differentiates one hand-held GPS from another is other factors such as size, weight, screen resolution, color screen, ease of use, and mapping features.
