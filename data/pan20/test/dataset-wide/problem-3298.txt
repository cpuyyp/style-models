As you can infer from my examples, the split affected not only Middle English */o:/ but also Middle English */u:/: 

Of course the two above sentences would both be highly ungrammatical in any American, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian English dialects. 

No, at least no documented languages have only front vowels. The general explanation for this is given by various theories for vowel dispersion. Schwartz, Boë, and Abry (1997) summarise one of these theories pretty well. Basically, there is a strong tendency for languages to spread their vowels evenly. Most theorise that this is because of learnability, others because of articulatory economy (Lindblom, 1975), others because they think systems self-organise in nature (de Boer, 2000). In 3 vowel systems, the most common vowels are /a/ /i/ /u/ with lots of speaker variation. In 5 vowel systems it tends to add in /e/ and /o/, 6 vowel systems most often add in a mid vowel like schwa. 7 or higher start getting rounding contrasts. There are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories. Many dialects of Danish have a highly asymmetric vowel inventory, with about twice as many front vowels as back vowels. Australian English also has a slightly asymmetric vowel inventory, with only 3 back vowels out of 11 monophongal minimal pairs. 

In Portuguese there are two accepted reasons vowels in verbs alternate in height. The vowel harmonizing rule states that where the theme vowel (a from -ar, e from -er, and i from -ir) is deleted from the conjugation and retains tonic stress, the root vowel is changed to match the height of the theme vowel.. 

However the following verbs are not subject to the rule because the theme verbs are short, marked with a caret. poner (ponĕre), cocer (coquĕre), beber (bibĕre), meter (mittĕre), romper (rumpĕre) 

In English, there is no change in meaning due to the change in palatalization, like there is in Russian. We have no contrastive words or minimal pairs due to palatalization. Дан [dan] and дань [danʲ] are different, meaning "Dane" and "tribute" but this differentiation doesn't occur in English. That doesn't mean that palatalization isn't an interesting concept in English though. For example: Western American speakers render "education" as [e.d͡ʒɪ̈.ˈkej.ʃɪ̈n], resulting from the palatalization of the 'd' followed by the /ju/. Some British accents pronounce "tune" as [t͡ʃun] for the same reason, and despite these siginficant changes in pronunciation due to palatalization, they do not change meaning. Our /ɹ/ sound has an interesting effect on palatalization as well in some dialects: "try" -> [t͡ʃɹaj] "dragon" -> [ˈd͡ʒɹæ.gɪ̈n] In conclusion we have quite the opposite phenomenon occurring in English, words can be significantly palatalized but do not change meaning. 

American, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand varieties of English are all strut~put splitting dialects, because most of the initial settlers of the colonies came from southern and western England after the split. The split was probably originally phonologically constrained, but then something happened to make it phonemic in many dialects. 2 Lexical Diffusion Most sound changes start in a set of words, and then spread to more words. This is called Lexical Diffusion, and was described in depth by Kiparsky (1995). It is pretty obvious from pieces written in Early Modern English, that the Great Vowel Shift did not happen all at once to every word in the lexicon. In 1582, John Hart wrote his book An Orthographie in which he proposed a spelling reform due to the change in the language in his lifetime. He designed a phonetic orthography based on his own speech, and spelled the vowel in TIME and BY as , but the vowel in MIGHT and TITLE as <ị>. It is evident, that the Great Vowel Shift started in a group of words, and then spread to others. With the back vowels, we see the least-complete shifts. Kiparsky (1995) noted many patterns with the back vowels. Kiparksy's original explanation for this, was that some words have underlying phonological forms, while others are unspecified in the lexicon, and are instead built by analogy. I personally find that explanation far-fetched, but there are some experimental phonology papers which would support it, I'll get back to those. Another explanation would be an Exemplar Theory approach, where a speaker produces vowels based on their input. The entire system is analogy, but some more high frequency words might either be more innovative, or more conservative. There is a bit of evidence supporting the idea that some words are more lexically encoded with phonological information, while others aren't. In nonsense word vs real word production experiments such as Hay, Drager, and Thomas (2013), speakers often are more conservative with nonsense words than with real words: 

The answer is because of vowel harmony in Vulgar Latin. The rule is not 100% anymore because Vulgar Latin was spoken so long ago. Clearly since the paradigm started, the stem changing has been applied to verbs that don't match the pattern, in general it is as follows: In verbs with medium height root vowels: 

Stepping off of the airplane in Lisbon, I could immediately hear that the pronunciation was much different from Brazilian Portuguese, which I am more accustomed to. The level of vowel deletion was so pronounced in fact, that I almost thought people were speaking Polish, due to the high number of awkward consonant clusters - such as brzydka or ptaki in the Slavic language. The four most striking and frequent examples I personally heard were: 

I am currently trying to learn Tamil. My friend who is teaching me seems to be making a clicking sound with one word in particular, and she can't seem to tell she's making it. The word is குளம் pronounced as [kʊ˞ɭʼʌm] - meaning pool or pond. Every time she says it my mind is blown when she transitions from the retroflex ɭ to the ʌ. The distance between these two sounds seems to be the maximum possible distance it can travel between two sounds. It's as if the tongue is slammed into the floor of the mouth causing a click-type sound. About 50% of the time she says the word I can hear a distinct click. I'm wondering if any phonologists out there have noticed these kinds of unintentional click sounds in any languages. Also, at what point would a click serve some sort of contrastive phoneme? Is it even possible for a language as old as Tamil to develop clicks? 

Under an exemplar theory approach, we would expect new words to be less innovative than high frequency words because a speaker hears less of them. References: Hay, J., Drager, K., & Thomas, B.

Is this your homework assignment? *'Boys loves to cry.' Person agreement. *'She didn't went to the market.' Tense. A Generativist model would probably explain this as 'do' occupying the spot where tense normally is licensed. However, there are languages where double tense marking is grammatical (and also double person agreement; this is even found in one Indo-European Language: Bulgarian). 'They are going for the party, isn't it?' Actually this is grammatical. In some dialects of English in the UK this is grammatical. In many dialects, the clitic innit can be used even when referring to plural subjects, and even to personal pronouns. 'Isn't it' has been grammaticalised as a negative tag question: 'Dogs are in the room, innit?' 'You like pizza, innit?' Essentially, 'isn't it' can be used to mean: 

As the other poster indicated, accent is the application of native phonology to another language. However, if someone grows up speaking two languages, they would necessarily have less of an accent than someone who speaks just one language. Two languages necessarily have a larger phoneme inventory than just one, which means the speaker has more native phonemes to choose from. The perfect example is from Portuguese. In my experience monolingual Spanish speakers have a really hard time pronouncing European Portuguese sounds, particularly the reduced vowels and opened variations of E and O. Whereas English speakers have trouble pronouncing rolled R and reduced consonants such as the approximates of B, V and D. In my experience, students who grew up speaking Spanish and English do wonderfully learning the Lisbon variant of Portuguese. In the case of Mandarin, from what I've heard the Chinese usually classify foreigners differently. Since that language is so unrelated to Spanish and English, typically they just say someone had a Western accent, which it is usually not easy to determine the origin. 

In the First, Second and Fourth declensions, Nominitive Plural is the same as Genitive Singular. The other two don't follow the same pattern, but don't deviate very far from it. Even in English, we say:
