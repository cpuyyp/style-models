Lower body exercises would probably help you build speed and prevent injury (by building muscle around your knee, for example, you'll be less likely to tear something). Runner's World has a great article called Faster in Five that outlines 5 different lower body exercises you can do, mostly just with your own body weight and dumbbells. These include single leg squats, balance run (also try the running man variation), heel raises, hamstring push-up (one-legged bridges on an exercise ball or chair), and plank lift. Regular squats, lunges, and high step ups are good too. 

You're right that flexibility is one of the major benefits - this is because yoga helps you stretch your muscles in a safe way and increase the range of motion in your joints. Stretching helps release the lactic acid that builds up in your muscles, which can relieve stiffness and fatigue. Additionally, holding many of the poses requires you to engage your core and build core strength, which helps improve balance and posture. You also build strength in your upper body by doing poses like plank and downward dog. The standing poses work your hamstrings and quads. (source) 

Stay hydrated. When dehydrated you get sunburn faster - much faster. Cover up. I always use a hat and long sleeves. Lately I've been using a neck gaiter that is supposed to keep you cool as well. Compression shirt, sleeves, pants are supposed to help too - hot weather version. Run in shady areas. Luckily here in the eastern states there are alot of forests and parks with lots of shade. Run while the sun is low like Sean Duggan says. Leave long runs for the winter time. Keep it to two hours and do more speedwork and more runs each week to make up for it. Double long run limited to 2 hours long. One Sat and one Sun or one in the morning and one in the evening. 

Heart rate monitors are easy to use for a 20 minute tempo run but what about these shorter times? Im asking about the dynamic change in heart rate at the start of a repeat like below. The 100m sprints arent even long enough I think to use heart rate...right? Here the maxHR is 184 bpm so 90% starts at 165.6 and Im just getting to that at the end of each 400m. Initially I thought 90% was closer to 170 bpm. Basically Im trying to hit 92-95% maxHR and Im wondering if Im chasing a ghost? 

That really depends on what your goals are. If you're trying to lose weight, then a calorie deficit is a good thing. But if you're trying to put on muscle, you actually want to be gaining weight (albeit muscle mass), so you want to be consuming more calories than you burn. You said you're trying to lose weight, so I'll elaborate a little more. From what I've read, yes you can consume more calories on days you work out and still lose weight. The reason behind that is the benefits of exercising don't stop at just the calories you burn during the workout. Muscles burn more calories at rest than fat, so if you're doing exercises that build muscle, you can and will need to eat more. You also get an "after burn" after some exercises. According to this source 

I came across this article today on calories burned when walking versus running the same distance. The important points are that you burn 5 calories for every liter of oxygen you consume while exercising, and running requires you to take in more oxygen because it increases your heart rate more. That is, although you're moving the same amount of weight over the same distance whether you walk or run, when you run you 

This is what I've learned from reading a few books and researching online, but still have to experience using this theory for myself. I think using HR properly should allow you to improve your running and adapt to different running conditions - like the great running antoganists heat and high humidity. One note on max HR. The value changes with fitness and actually lowers the better your cardiovascular system is. I suspected this for a few reasons of my own and finally have some confirmation here which points to a paper by Zavorsky, G.S. 2000, Endurance and possible mechanisms of altered maximum heart rate with endurance training and tapering. Sports Med 29(1):13-26 During sprint workouts according to Greg McMillan (2) you should not reach your max HR. One of these reasons appears to be the short nature of the workout. I think the HR curve over time during each sprint should be the same given the same effort and other physical conditions. This could probably be used to find your actual maxHR for running and can be used for targeting HRs for all other workouts. This also makes sense for using a 12 minute test instead of a shorter time since an 8 min or shorter race should be at or above VO2max pace which will require being at an effort that should eventually reach maxHR. Reaching maxHR is probably a bad thing to do when testing physical fitness, and Im not sure if this means you will faint once reaching it or after staying at it for some amount of time. For speedwork on the track the average HR should not be used due to the fact that maxHR cant be reached during sprints. The HR curve should level off given a minute or so and that level should be between 90-100% of your actual running HRmax. The actual HRmax is not the "220 - age" HRmax and I am doubtful that it is the HR that causes you to pass out regardless of the exercise used to come up with a number. Also it seems the HR curve levels off only approximately - not sure. (2): YOU (Only Faster) Ch 19 Sprints, somewhere in the first few paragraphs 

If you're talking about cardio, there are a few reasons to do it first thing in the morning. First of all, you haven't eaten for several hours, so your body will turn to fat for energy instead of food you've eaten. According to this post, 

You're right that it's very important to cool down after exercising. Cool down should consist of three phases: gentle exercise (to gradually lower the heart rate and prevent dizziness), stretching (to reduce muscle stiffness), and refueling. Here's another useful article on cooling down. In general, as xpda points out, a lot of runners neglect the cool down because they're so exhausted at the end of a race (I know I'm guilty of this from time to time). A cool down is designed to restore your body to pre-exercise conditions, but it still takes effort. Stretching can be somewhat painful if you've really worked your muscles. In the video you linked to, however, the runner was immediately swept into celebration following the race, so he didn't exactly have the opportunity to cool down. According to this article - it's best to breathe through both the nose and the mouth while running. So perhaps it's unnecessary to open the mouth very wide if you're also breathing through your nose. 

Running with other people can be fun alot of fun, like sharing here on StackExchange. Otherwise destination running can be fun too. For me I used the Pikes Peak Marathon as a source of inspiration. Now I have Grindstone 100, Keys 100, Hardrock 100 and Nolans 14 as similar destination type sources of motivation. I use Strava and Endomondo and seeing others accomplish things motivation me to get out there too. Also I had a goal to beat my times from the past, done, and have taken up my goal from the past to see how fast I can run. So self competition is a big factor for me to go run. So enjoy your runs :) 

I want to know what is the phenomenon, or if it exists, that makes you stay at the same pace after about 2 hours of running. Changing speeds whether its to slow down or speed up feels slightly painful at first. Several times in marathons I get stuck in problem and end up running very slow to try to get rid of the pain with no success. A few times I've run at speeds that are faster than normal or slower than normal where that pace became the only comfortable pace after a few hours. Today even trying to walk up an incline my legs almost automatically continue to move at a similar cadence and slowing down didnt feel good. 

You don't want to beat your body up too much right before a race. Generally, the advice is to taper your training 1-2 weeks before. However, if you were a runner before your 2-3 month break, then a 5k might not be too much for your body to handle, and you could just train up to a few days before. Your training should depend partially on your goals (speed? just finishing?), and partially on what you can do now. How far are you able to run now without stopping? If you could do a 5k before your 2-3 months off, you might still be able to do it with a little bit of a struggle. If not, you could try something like: Something like: Day 1: Run 1 mile Day 2: Run 3 miles Day 4: Run 2 miles Day 5: Run 3 miles Day 7: Run 2 miles Day 8: Run 3 miles Day 10: 5k That will give you a feel for what a 5k is like, since you'll have done 3 miles a few times. But you also won't be pushing it too much before the race. Another approach you could take is to go out on Day 1 and just try to run a 5k to see if you can do it already. If you can, then you could just run 3 miles every other day up until Day 7 or so, and incorporate some interval training to increase speed. In general, if you can already do the 5k you could concentrate more on your time. If not, you need to build up to where you can complete the distance but not worry about the speed so much. 

Sounds like you like to use a challenge to pursue to find motivation to run. For running a half marathon many people like follow a marathon training plan. This isn't necessary but many people do it because the plan incorporates nice long distance runs once a week and builds up millage to 40 miles/week or more. Runs per week are about 3-4 and as high as 6-7. About 1-3 hard runs a week with 2-4 easy runs. In other words, many people do alot of training in order to run that distance fast. Since you want to finish in 2 hours and have a hard time doing a few kilometers I think you can achieve it. Here are a few tips. Walking fast can be just as exhausting as a jog or slow run so keep that up. Dont try to run at a hard effort for any specific distance until you have run that distance for 2-3 weeks and have done at least one run at the distance were the pace has been changed between easy and hard (like intervals, progressive runs, or fast finish runs). Build up a routine that includes a long run for 2-3 hours. Dont jump up to any pace, distance, or time without bulding up for it. Build up to 2 hours for the long run and dont worry about taking walking breaks. Eat and drink water for any run close to 2 hours which includes any breaks. Mentally accepting to take a break at any time can allow you to run farther and faster without taking a break - well at least for me. Dont run hard unless you feel good. Dont bother running for more than 3 hours until you need to do it for meeting a training plan distance during your future marathon training :) Running easy means you can talk, you are not breathing hard, and you actually find yourself paying attention to your surroundings. Running aerobically means your breathing rate has increased noticeably, your conversations are limited to short statements, your moving well but not reaching or pushing too much, and your not feeling your heart beat. Run long runs easy. Build up to 1-2 aerobic medium to hard effort runs to about 15-18 km about 4 weeks before half marathon - at or near goal pace. In the weeks leading up to the half make sure to taper but by reducing your overall distance without slowing down your pace (or speeding it up :) Hope this helps. A short list of popular coaches and authors that might help through their books and websites are Greg McMillan, Hal Higdon, Jack Daniels, and Pete Pfitzinger. A good source of motivation to get out there and run can be found by seeing what others are doing by checking out running apps for your phone and PC like Endomondo and Strava. Endomondo is popular in Europe and Strava in the US. Strava is great for finding places to run and Endomondo is great for tracking your improving fitness & speed. 

When you first start out doing a particular exercise, obviously it's harder than if you've been doing it for a while and your body is used to it. Does that mean it takes more energy, and that you therefore burn more calories doing an exercise when it's new to you, compared to when you're "in shape" for it? 

It looks like the shoes you have would be fine for running, but it depends on how long you've had them and how worn out they are. You don't want to be running in something that gives you no support, and if you literally wear them every day that might be the case with them. On the other hand, the Couch to 5k program has you running three times a week, and you don't want to get blisters from using new shoes without breaking them in gradually. If you want to get serious about running, I'd recommend getting a new pair of shoes (maybe going to a running store where they can recommend what to buy) and then alternating your old shoes and new shoes for first couple of weeks. That way you break in the new shoes gradually while starting off with something you're comfortable in. 

Look for the book Eat and Run by Scott Jurek. He lists many recipes for vegetarians and this includes some vegan ones too. He is an ultra marathoner (living) legend and has had this philosophy of getting enough protein in mind from the beginning of his career. 

Its not bad. You are probably shifting your weight by doing this. I got the standard pushup PhD from the Army. There are several different ways to do a pushup and if you do a set each way you'll get more of a workout in and do more overall. The biggest boost in strength Ive gotten from pushups have come from repeatedly going through muscle failure in many different ways in the same workout. Using my knees became a normal part of my routine. Also became a fan of the 8 count pushup where you start standing and get down to do two then recover. Im not very strong in my arms so Ive always had to work harder than others to get that strength, so that was one good way for me to get it. For situps though I never grabbed my legs and followed the advice that it will hurt your back, but I did the same thing in general. There are a bunch of ways of doing a situp too. Actually Ive started doing the same thing for running related strength training. Yeah so the answer is yes because overall you extend the session training yourself to do that one fundamental movement... ... darn, another reason for long runs.
