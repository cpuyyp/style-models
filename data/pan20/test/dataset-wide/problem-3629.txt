You have too many goals. Remove some of them. You can do them later. "Focusing" on strength, aesthetics, doing a bunch of exercises...just because? and introducing Olympic lifts is hard for any athlete, and is a bad idea for someone new to designing workout programs. Pick what's important. Do that. Do the other stuff later. What you've proposed is essentially 5/3/1 Boring But Big. It's a known, successful version of your plan, plenty of people have done it and reported back, and it has built-in guidance on introducing assistance exercises like you want to. I would note that reports show it to be more on the bodybuilding side of "powerbuilding", and many folks seem to have lost strength using it. It's impossible to say more until you provide more focus and information on what you've been doing and why it isn't working anymore. 

You're not really greasing the groove right now, and greasing the groove may not be the path to your goal. 

Excessive joint mobility and muscle flexibility can cause instability and lack of strength at end ranges of motion. Most people need to improve their range of motion because they are so immobile. But for people who are extremely mobile, pushing to further ranges of motion can cause problems. For many sports, tasks, and health in general, we want to maintain some level of mobility, but not too much, especially in some areas. For instance: 

Progress at the rate which you feel is safe. If you have back problems, fix them while working out as hard and heavy as possible while not aggravating those problems. Once they're fixed, add back in the weight or exercises that you took out. Eat in accordance with how heavy you're lifting. Drop the long-term multiples-of-bodyweight goals. Just focus on safely getting stronger now. 

If I'm focusing on challenging myself in lifting, I'm confident my form was excellent, and I have my recovery dialed in—my sleep and food are of a high quality, I feel good, no injuries—I may add weight in the expectation that my body will recover and get stronger by the next workout. If lifting is a secondary priority, or I'm not sure how good my form was on that last set, or some elements of my recovery aren't optimal, I might try to add weight or I might stay at the same weight and try to really smash it and feel capable doing so. The answer depends on a lot of situational factors. For an athletic novice on a linear progression, or for someone who is by nature very cautious and holding themselves back, I might say add weight. For someone with mediocre form, or a non-athlete, or someone who is inconsistent, or in a dozen other scenarios, I might say to master their current weight. The lift in question matters, too, since highly skill-dependent lifts like the clean, snatch, or squat warrant more time than, say, the deadlift (for someone who has already ingrained proper form in the deadlift). 

...then why the need to hit yet another deltoid? Unless they're bodybuilding clients (in which case I question their use of tools), I would find it unnecessary and an odd thing to make a priority. You could also buy a kettlebell or dumbbell to take with you. Even just one 25 or 35 pound KB is sufficient for just about all the resistance you'd need for a beginner to work their upper body. 

Do the original workout described above, heavy squats and pull-ups Run a mile (notice, this goes after the strength work) 

The deadlift is awesome I find deadlifts very productive. Since they're a multi-joint, multi-muscle exercise, they promote growth across the entire back and legs. Done heavy, I've found them very efficient at adding muscle. This is partially because I am a novice. It might be different for your situation. I don't know of many exercises that could be said to fully replace the deadlift. Squats? Romanian deadlifts? Barbell hip thrusts? They're all close, but not quite it. You should deadlift Since the deadlift is easy to learn, safe if done correctly, and simple to do heavy, I think you would love deadlifting. Start light and add weight frequently. 

Do the original workout described above, heavy squats and pull-ups Five to ten minutes kettlebell swings, aiming for maximum reps. (A dumbbell can be used as a substitute.) 

In other words, you can't "tone" your little bulge. You need to exercise your whole body and eat less or eat better. This will improve your whole body, which will include your little bulge. I don't know your diet, lifestyle, or current workout regimen so I can't advise on how you should specifically proceed. 

Muscle tone may play significant role in the different stiffness of your muscles versus your friend's: 

then you're doing way, way less than you should. Living well is a big goal. Huge. I'd say it requires close to full-time investment in strength, mobility, and cardio. Right now you're doing just about zero strength training, a lot of one form of steady-state cardio but not much else, and a smidge of vanity work. That doesn't comport with your stated goals. Strength is important for long-term health, since it is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality (one, two, three, four, five) and keeps you able to do a variety of tasks yourself. It works together with flexibility and mobility, which have obvious quality-of-life benefits with regards to daily tasks. Cardiorespiratory fitness is of course important as well. To meet your goals, I'd do three or four strength workouts a week, plus as much cardio as you feel like doing. The cardio would not be unimodal but would vary between long steady-state work like your incline treadmilling and short, higher-intensity work, perhaps with intervals but definitely with different tools (swimming, sprinting with full rests in between, dumbbell swings, et cetera). It is important to vary the conditioning work so that you don't get too good any any one activity and thereby decrease the cardio benefits of it. Finally, don't base your workout goals on BMI. It's a terrible metric. Be honest and stick with visual goals. 

High intensity intervals and eliminating carbs sounds good to me. I'd pull back on the weights, staying on the high-weight, low-rep side, but not eliminate them. If your goal were mine, I'd scour Martin Berkhan's LeanGains for information to see if I can tweak anything further than the basics already mentioned. 

Anything more strenuous than a long hike is detrimental to totally orthodox, full-focus-on-strength-and-size Starting Strength. However, I've found that daily (or less frequent) yoga is a great supplement to powerlifting. If you're capable of all the exercises in the program, there's no particular need for additional stretching. I've found that the exercises themselves provide a moderate degree of mobility work. I've also found that many people, particularly the un-athletic, are incapable of performing at least one of the lifts without specific stretching, mobility work, and copious warm-up. 

JudoFitness asserts that the three pathways smoothly shift gears when training hard for extended periods of time: 

(If I may interject here: the recommendation of "brisk walking" has been criticized for being easily subverted into plain walking. They really mean brisk. It's got to be moderately intense--a hike, not a stroll.) Anyway, the CDC's recommendations continue: 

Not really; and I don't think that doing so would be that useful. Just track your progress with reps, sets, and rest times on these machines or with whatever bodyweight work you do. Trying to determine analogues between exercises is difficult even when the weights are known and fairly similar; I wouldn't even try comparing an outdoor rowing machine of a particular brand with anything else. 

It sounds like you need to follow a one-legged (pistol) squat progression. You shouldn't expect to just be able to do a pistol the first time you try. Personally, I achieved a bodyweight pistol squat with twice-a-week strength/skill workouts that involved: 

Mobility in the hips is often just as much a problem as tight shoulders and hamstrings. Squatting early and often helped me. General practices I improved my squat by: 

This says I warmed up my front squat with a set of five each at 45, 95, and 145 pounds before my work sets. The three tick marks at the end show that I completed three work sets, telling me-six-months-from-now that I meant three sets of five. I certainly don't think this method is optimal. The Comma Method Another method I use refuses to write down the number of sets at all, but instead demarcates sets with commas, like so: 

Yes, Pull-Ups Are Awesome Even If You Can Only Do A Few You should do multiple sets of chin-ups, using negatives to get a larger total number for the workout. If you can only do three pull-ups in a set, then do three--strict ones, good ones, all the way down and all the way up--and then do another three as negatives (jumping to the top and lowering yourself down as slowly as possible), then wait three minutes and do it again, then wait three minutes and do it again, then wait three minutes and do it again, then wait three minutes and do it one last time. If you can't get three every time that's fine. Use the negatives to get five or so in a set, and do several sets. If you can't do even one full range of motion strict no-kipping pull-up, the lat pull-down machine, assisted pull-up machine, and bands would also be called for. You should also do bench press or push-ups or dips to build the opposing muscle, for both health and looking big. 

So, those are one set of goals to work on. In terms of resources, you could look around for coaches you'd trust with your training, or you could do some reading. Ross Enamait wouldn't be a bad place to start on the latter. 

When the upper outer front part of my leg feels tight or painful during squats, I find the best results from stretching my glutes. Stretches like yoga's pigeon pose: 

Load-bearing and high-impact exercise increase bone density. So squatting, deadlifting, and pressing heavy weights overhead would help. (As they say, barbell training is big medicine.) So would running, jumping, and all the variants thereof. Field sports are another fine way to make sure you give the body some impact. 

Unfamiliar exercises are harder than familiar exercises. The 8x400 zonked you because you're used to 20k runs. A sprinter used to 8x400 would be zonked after a 20k run. Things we're not good at or that we don't do are more exhausting. 

I've found overhead presses to be a poor way to fix a programmer's hunch. Pulling exercises like barbell rows, deadlifts, and pull-ups have helped me much more in that regard. Since any program for you should include both a push and a pull, you should probably omit the overhead press and use that time for mobility work instead. 

This may or may not be a problem. If it is a problem, it could have many causes. The fix I prefer most for this is the wall-facing squat: without a barbell, you face a smooth wall, then get your toes as close as possible to the wall and just squat. Try not to bang into the wall, but grazing it is OK. If you need to back up a few inches then do so. If you can't do it, stretch your hips and ankles for a few minutes and try again. Being able to do ten wall-facing squats with my toes touching the wall has made big improvements to my posture and depth while squatting with a barbell. The movement is great practice for proper posture across the back and legs, in addition to forcing you to do extra mobility work as it develops flexibility and gives you a mental model of how to make it work. Again, see the instructional YouTube video. 

I'm in front of a laptop 9 hours a day. I was Quasimodo until I did this. Stretching, yoga and lightweight "core" exercises did nothing, because my back was not strong. Once you are strong the yoga, stretching and accessory exercises can be added back in, and will be very productive. 

Never trust a barbell. The gym owner will swear it's 45 pounds. It ain't. Your workout partner will swear he weighed it last year and it's 25 pounds. It ain't. There are a lot of different bars, whether Olympic, standard, curl or whatever, and they're being built to different weights. When it comes to precision, different brands have different standards. A bar being used for Olympic competition in the snatch is going to be a lot closer to its stated weight than a beater bar used in the gym. (It's manufactured to tighter tolerances.) The only way to know how much a barbell weighs is to weigh it.
