There are several options that stem from the idea "Something cannot hinder you if it is not there", namely the FD. Specifically, you can go the ways of 1x or single speed. Both variants assume you remove all the machinery related to the front shifting (== bonus weight savings!) and leave the single front chainring. For MTB applications the lowest teeth count you can have on the alivio spider is most likely 32t, and that is what I recommend. The rear derailleur you have is not optimal for achieving a wide ratio range, as 9 speed cassettes are not that wide and will never be. Now even a 10 speed Shimano deore cassette can be had with range 11-42 teeth, and that is just fine for a casual off road adventurer. With 9 speeds (11-34 teeth range) in the back and 32 teeth at the front, one might sometimes feel out of range, but even this setup might be fine on flatter terrains. One can choose to throw all this gearing bullshit away and go boldly with single speed. Rear hub conversion kits (a cog, cassette spacers and a chain tensioner) are cheap. More weight savings, no thought power wasted on choosing the right gearing because you are always in the wrong gear, and more fun on descents. On climbs, not so much. Another crazy idea is to cut some knobs of the rear tyre. There are in fact MTB tyres that are meant to be trimmed by users to their liking, and dedicated tools to do that. The drawback is obviously losing some traction in situations when the removed knobs would have been working. Finally, moving the rear wheel farther back would be the easiest solution. This is what I actually resorted to when I faced the same issue on my fatbike, because its frame was designed as a multipurpose one. But it requires sliding rear dropouts, which are not super common on MTBs with derailleurs. An eccentric rear hub would also do, but I am unaware if there are any designed for non single speed systems. 

Most likely yes, the M772 will work. As you have already calculated, the capacity is within spec, and the maximum sprocket size is out of range by just 2 teeth. In my experience this is very likely to work, so long as the rear dropout on your frame is not especially near to the axle, and so long as you tighten the "B screw" more than normal with a smaller cassette. Whatever you do, don't buy a "Dyna-Sys" model, because they aren't compatible with your shifters. This rules out the M780. Also note that with the super-low gear of 30x36, you do somewhat increase the chances of breaking a rear spoke (or the chain) if you put a large amount of force into the pedals with such low gearing. This isn't a big concern, but don't get carried away with it unless your body weight is quite low. 

Yes, it is common on mountain bikes to have a wider front tire. This is to avoid "washing out" in corners. Plus the extra air volume provides more cushion and increased comfort for your hands (even if you have suspension). 

All Shimano cassettes, and all SRAM cassettes other than "XD" ones, have the same spline pattern. If you search for "cassette lockring tool" you will find lots of compatible tools. Virtually the only incompatible ones will be SRAM XD and Campagnolo, and they will be specifically labeled as such. 

The above would apply to any performance-oriented bike to some degree. A more expensive road bike like the professionals use is of little advantage--what you really need is a team mechanic who looks after all these issues every day. 

Replace your RD-6700-GS derailleur with an XT M771 SGS "9 speed" (also works with 10) rear derailleur. It is important that the new derailleur is NOT labeled "Dyna-Sys" (which won't work). This has a "capacity" of 45 teeth; your front big/small rings are 50/30t (n.b. you also mentioned 52t, not sure which is right). So of the 45 tooth capacity you use 20 in the front, leaving 25 for the rear. That means you can use an 11-36 cassette, which would be a huge improvement (20% gear reduction vs your 30t). Total cost around $120-160 (derailleur, cassette, chain). Replace your crankset. This is problematic because MTB front derailleurs are not compatible with your road shifter. You'd probably need to use a bar-end shifter instead, which is not expensive but might not be to your liking if you use the front shifter a lot. You could use an XT crankset and get down to say 24t instead of your existing 30t. But you'll lose some top-end gears. Total cost around $150-400 (crankset, derailleur, shifter, chain). 

Other factors are less deciding. Inner tubes should be fine. There might be some extra muscle effort needed if you install tubeless-ready tires on a regular rim (or was it the other way around? cannot remember). If your fork does not accept wider tires, you can change the fork. If it is the frame that has too narrow rear wheel clearance, changing it equals practically to obtaining a new bike. Getting new wider wheels is easier, because you'll then have two pairs of nice wheels. Some people use 27.5+ wheels on 29-ers, but if bike geometry is not an empty sound for you, you might consider doing some calculations before going that way. 

I assume you would use the bicycle in the city. In this case, a suspension fork does not make much comfort difference compared to a rigid one — there are no roots or rock gardens in St Petersburg. It will make even less difference in a deep snow when all terrain features are smoothed by it, and you cycle slower than usual because the ground is more slippery and treacherous. I would definitely go with a rigid fork (no matter what material). In terms of comfort, I would also go with the widest tires possible. 

I have a full rigid (fat) bicycle and I am playing with an idea to use a suspension fork sometimes. I want to keep the possibility to swap the old fork back when I do not need suspension but want to drop weight instead. The swapping process does not have to be super-swift but it should be doable without special tools (i.e., only with a set of Allen keys). Almost like a wheel change, only with more steps. Now, a fork also carries certain hardware, besides the wheel. For example, I would either need two front disk brake calipers or move a single caliper between forks. Ditto for stem and top cap, mudguard, possibly fork's remote lockout or maybe something else. All of them can be moved with hexkeys. The headset's lower race is what I am worried about. It sits on top of a fork's crown and can be (re)mounted only using special tools, sometimes impact tools. I assume moving the race between two forks would not be easy and most likely reduce its lifespan. What are the best practices in this situation? Possible solutions that come to my mind. 

The frame is 100% trash. Do not attempt to use it at all. What you can do is to carefully remove everything from the frame. Discard the frame, and now you have a whole bunch of valuable parts. You can either buy a new (possibly second hand) frame, or just sell the parts to finance the purchase of another bike. There are a few parts you won't be able to easily remove, such as the headset and the bottom bracket, but these are not very valuable anyway, so don't worry about buying the special tools for those. 

Yes, you can use that bike for touring. Probably not "proper loaded touring" which is the most traditional type, but light touring, i.e. sleeping in hotels and not carrying a lot of food or luxury items like a laptop. You have a few options to outfit the bike with a modest amount of cargo capacity: 

It doesn't matter a lot if it's slightly off. But you should be able to center the calipers by hand, even after the mounting bolt is tightened. Just grasp the two brake arms firmly and rotate the entire caliper a bit (with no pressure applied to the brake lever). In my experience this is usually sufficient to get the caliper centered enough. Riding for a while will sometimes help center them as well. 

If you look closely at the zoomed photo on Specialized's site, you can see that the label on the "custom" front derailleur says only "SRAM" and "2x10". The regular ones made by SRAM say "X0" or other model names on them, e.g. here: $URL$ It appears that the style of mount is readily available, but perhaps not the precise model with no labeling that Specialized is using. Maybe that means they're using something "between" the regular SRAM grades, or maybe a different surface finish, or.... But this shouldn't matter if you simply need to buy a replacement. 

The difference between handlebars, or in general body postures on bicycle, starts to show itself at distances of 50 km. For 5 kilometers a day, which I assume consist of two intervals of 2.5 km each (to work and back), it really does not matter. I would say gearing would play more difference than type of bike. 

If you are certain that it is the upper pulley that rubs against the cassette, you may want to explore these two options. 

Actual tire dimensions when installed on a given rim may differ from what's designated on it. There are a lot of reports online that a 2.6" tire actually measures closer to 2.7" or even 2.8". The same applies to non-plus tires: a 2.1" can sometimes be 2.25" when installed on a wider rim. Knobs can add to width and create problems with clearance. I recommend either playing it safe and taking a narrower "plus" or finding an online review with actual measurements of chosen tire applicable to your situation. 

EDIT As ojs points out in the comments below, the freehub's width of 7-speed systems mismatches those of 8- to 10-speeds. This means the rear hub/wheel has to be changed as well, in addition to everything listed below. Clearly a cost of such change now would exceed the price of a half new bike. 

In general, a recently regreased hub tends to show more friction than it had before the regreasing. In normal circumstances, I would recommend giving it a spin during a ten-twenty kilometers ride and then would recheck if the friction is still bad. However… It is not clear how "enormous" the friction at that position is. If all the balls are new and the races did not look to be beaten to death or at least looked evenly worn, the only explanation I can imagine is that you've put more balls to one or both sides of the hub than necessary. Did you count amount of old balls per side? It is safer to set one ball less than optimal than to cram in one ball more. 

Five to eight years seems reasonable. See here: $URL$ - some helmet makers recommend somewhere in this range, and longer than eight years you start to see deterioration from sun damage, occasional knocks, etc. My last helmet lasted only four years in high-UV riding, about 15,000 km total, before the plastic strap around the back simply cracked in half. This didn't make it 100% useless or ineffective, but it surely prompted replacement. But this was a lot of riding, mostly in bright sun and high temperatures. 

Yes, you can use 28mm tires with Shimano Ultegra 6800 calipers (or virtually any other road calipers). The brands you mentioned produce a multitude of different forks. I am fairly sure that most all of them would also support 28mm tires. However, all of this also depends on a factor you did not discuss: your wheels. If your rims are too narrow, it will be very inconvenient to remove and install the wheel with tire inflated. If your rims are too wide, you run a slightly higher risk of interference with the fork. This is because a "28mm" tire is not really standard or as precise as the label implies: it could be 25mm to 30mm depending on the brand, the model, and the rim's interior width. And there is another potential problem: you have chip seal roads there, do you not? The chips sometimes get stuck to tires, and when that happens, you will not be rewarded for having the least possible fork crown clearance. In summary: you'll have to try it out. You might be forced to buy 25/26mm tires, or a different brand, if your chosen 28mm ones run on the wide side, or you have unusual rims, or you have debris where you ride. Consider buying one 28mm tire first to try out, and use it in the back if it doesn't work in front. 

It happened to me once that a V-brake pad that sat too low relative to the rim's braking surface literally wedged itself down into the rim at braking. To alleviate this, reposition both pad's position and angle. Always make sure that it clears the tire, because otherwise braking friction will destroy the sidewall in no time. 

Have you considered cable pull adapter that would allow you use both MTB shifter and present road front derailleur? Jtek Shiftmate 7 seems to do what you need. I have not used any such adapters myself yet but I thought you should need about such possibility. 

Your frame and fork clearances should allow wider tires. Both in increased width and height. Typically, bicycle vendors designate if a bike is "plus" compatible. If not, the risk is high that no tires designated as 29+ will fit in a 29 frame. In such case, you'd better consider switching to 27.5+ wheels if you are firm to go plus. Your rim width. There are limits to how wide/narrow a rim can be to accept a given tire width. Here's ERTRO guidelines, copied from here: 

You need to service your new fork periodically. I've seen vendor's recommendations to do it once every 50 hours of operation. For my taste, that is way too often. Once a season should be the lowest frequency for the service. 

There is a good guide on existing bottom brackets standards. An excerpt from it: "The BB386 EVO cranks are compatible with almost every BB shell standard (BSA, BB30, PF30, BB86)," says Jason Miles of FSA. "We currently make bottom brackets and adaptors for BSA, BB30, and PF30 frames and are working on BB86 bottom brackets. So look for a proper adapter. It seems that this is what your are looking for. Note that you will need a bike shop's help with installing it as it requires to press away the existing BB and press in the new one.
