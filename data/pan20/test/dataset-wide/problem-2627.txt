Axioms are specific sentences in a formal language, they contain specific formulae, variables, and terms. Axiom schema are general sentences that show how to create specific axioms within a formal system. Schema generalize over all of the formulae, variables, and terms in the language. You go from a scheme to an axiom by substituting in specifics for the generalized place holders in the scheme. For example: 

Current understandings of time are no longer rooted solely in our phenomenology of temporal experiences. We now have empirical ways to test a theory of temporal (spatio-temporal) structure. In regards to time travel, in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article on time in the section on time travel it states: 

Clearly we can see that (a) is false, so no matter what the other sentences say, the entire conjunction (a AND b AND c) is false. The sentence is meaningful because it presents us with a false statement, one that is logically analyzable, as opposed to some weird and incoherent string of symbols. This should also highlight how this is an "indirect" theory of reference. We are not saying "he is the king of France" while pointing at someone. We are saying "something or other is the king of France" and "whatever that something is is bald". We never pick out that one individual thing so we are not referencing something that does not exist. In the most straightforward way possible, to Russell the sentence "I have two hands" means: 

There is a point in ethics where the question stops being about "morally right" and "morally wrong" and it turns into "morally obligatory" "morally permissible" and "morally impermissible." Its not that "right and wrong" or "good and bad" don't mean anything, it's more so that they don't encapsulate the entire story just on their own. Morally obligatory means that the action is good and you, as a moral agent, are under an obligation to do that action. Remember that a moral agent is someone who has the ability to make decisions based off of moral reasoning and they can be held accountable for those actions. If someone is trapped under a car and you have the ability to assist them without causing any inconvenience or harm to yourself, many ethicists would agree that you are morally obligated to help that person. Morally permissible means that an action is not outright wrong. Some people make the argument that abortion is morally permissible, that is, it is not necessarily a "morally good" action to have an abortion but it is also not "morally bad". A large amount of people say that abortion in the case of incest or rape, or when having the child would have serious medical ramifications for the child or mother, is morally permissible. Morally impermissible is something that is not obligatory or permissible. Many people would make the argument that as a moral agent, if you went and murdered somebody with no provocation or any sort of rational reasoning behind it, that would be a morally impermissible act. They would argue that you, as a moral agent who is capable of reasoning about the ethical implications of actions, have done something that is not allowed by any rational thought about ethics. You took somebody's rights to their life away, you committed a horrible act and you understood the harm in doing so, so that act is obviously impermissible. There are obvious cases where it would be easy to say "you committed a morally impermissible act and that was morally wrong of you" but there are other cases, like your example with buying alcohol, where the act wasn't outright morally right or wrong, it was just a morally permissible action. As for animals, especially before contemporary thoughts on this subject, most people argued that animals are not rational moral agents. They argued that the animals don't understand what it means to be ethical, they can't reason within an ethical system, so their actions are not made as a moral agent. As such, we can't assign ethical values to their actions. An animal might kill to eat another animal, but most people would argue that the animal doesn't understand the concept of "murder" or "right vs. wrong" so its not that their actions are neutral, its that they aren't acting with moral agency, they aren't a rational agent. We are moral agents, we understand ethical reasoning and we understand, to a large extent at least, what is morally impermissible and what is morally permissible, therefore acting like an animal isn't an excuse to commit morally impermissible actions. A strict Utilitarian view is that we are morally obligated in every situation to do the action that maximizes utility (happiness, well being, or however else it is specifically defined). Again, a strict view would be that if you are given two options and one of them is morally obligatory, it increases utility more than the other action, it would be morally impermissible to do that action. Not all Utilitarians believe in the strictest view and some might see your example of buying beer as a morally obligatory vs a morally permissible action. 

But what makes a religion genuine or acceptable from a secular perspective? Simply that some group of adults profess to regard it as their own, as such (i.e., they explicitly say, "This is our religion"). As a philosopher, I'd go one step further and say it must also involve metaphysics ("What is metaphysics?" being another question).1 That's two straightforward defining characteristics. So this would be a very open definition of religion, pretty close to the one answer you've perhaps said is not good enough. "Group" there is part of the definition. The esoteric beliefs of an individual, metaphysical or otherwise, cannot constitute a religion until they convince others to hold them -- which is how a lot of religions explicitly got their start. Of course, it may often be important for pragmatic purposes, under the law, to define religion in a more strict way. For example, simply on the basis of the size of the group, or, as I think is often the case, on the basis of a decision made by a government appointed board that presumably includes experts in the field of religious studies and prominent members of prominent religions (Bishops, Rabbis, etc). However, those pragmatic purposes are not philosophical. They are to account for people who may abuse an existing legal situation, e.g., to form a religion for tax purposes, to get more days off from work, etc. There's also pragmatic considerations such as, "Does the religion preach violence toward others?". But I don't think this is what you meant by (un)acceptable in your question, i.e., you could have something which is acceptable by a given definition of religion that is still not an acceptable institution socially. I do not think we can define religion politely and say, e.g., that the Spanish Inquisition doesn't count as part of the history of the Catholic Church because "those people weren't really religious". See #2 WRT Scientology. 

You've confused the modern use of the term, which, like rhetoric, is now used almost exclusively pejoratively, with its use in Socrates' era (i.e., the era of the people we generally refer to as that of "the Sophists"), when it meant the teaching of wisdom. A major aspect of Sophistry was the elaboration of persuasive techniques. We might hear this now and cynically assume this means the art of lying, however, it ideally means the art of telling the truth. Formal logic might be considered a persuasive technique in this sense. The truth is not always something everyone wants to hear and to be believed you might need to, e.g., know something about your audience and how to lead them to a particular conclusion. Not everyone is going to be moved by formal logic. I believe people like Protagoras were concerned with things like this. Today the Sophists probably do get a decent amount of respect in academic circles, but there was perhaps a long period post Enlightenment (particularly in the English speaking world) when this was less so, hence your 1968 book requiring a "proactive defence". The mainstream bias maybe remains because of a modern insecurity: that a lot of our foundations for various social practices which are supposed to be sound and reasonable are perhaps really B.S. (i.e., products of negative rhetoric and sophistry). E.g., Once upon a time it was socially acceptable to spout all kinds of absurd rhetoric and hyperbole (a very false spreading of wisdom) about Jews and homosexuals, but it is less so now. What happened? Was't our culture all about absolute reason? Or maybe it is more about (a poor sort of) sophistry that we'd like to deny? So, today good politicians deride rhetoric and (small s) sophistry in others, and deny it in themselves, despite the fact that by any objective standard they all (or at least, all the successful ones) practice it wholesale. Likewise, we disdain criminal defence lawyers for their sophistry in defending criminals, but admire it in prosecutors. Perhaps the modern age would benefit to a return to the value of (capital S) Sophism as an art and means to the truth, rather than just an excuse to say whatever you want. We've thrown the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. 

which is a synthetic statement given the canonical definition, and we had an algorithm that decides that statement in NP-complete time we would label it synthetic. What would happen if in two years someone finds an algorithm that decides that question in polynominal time? Would we then discover that that sentence is actually analytic, we just didn't know? In that sense, we could use the example of listing information and then verifying a statement would just become scanning a list, so all statements would become analytic because that would be a linear time algorithm. Discovering a sentence is analytic instead of synthetic by going out and doing something in the world is completely antithetical to the idea of an analytic statement. 

In this view, vacuum refers to an actual region of spacetime. Remember that quantum field theory tells us that there are fields that exist all throughout the universe. Even if you remove particles from a region of spacetime the fields themselves still exist in those points, they are just in a minimum energy state so there is no actual particle or radiation in that space. If you were to put a field vacuum inside of a box (build a box around a particular region of vacuous spacetime?) then that region would still have a dimension of length, because it is still spacetime that is permeated with minimum energy field vacua. On the other hand, a void is the idea of a region of space and nothing else. It doesn't have minimum energy field vacua, it doesn't even have a time component. It is the abstract concept of just having a region of space. If you were to have a box that had a void inside of it it would still have a length because it is the definitional concept of space. From Wikipedia: 

This view of language is in sharp contrast with theories such as the canonical Fregean/Russellian theory of meaning. Generally, Fregean/Russellian theories of meaning hold central the idea that propositions hold meaning and are somehow semantically related to the world. The idea that language, propositions, and definitions are well defined in central to this view. Even Wittgenstein shared this idea in his early days in the Tractatus: 

I'm presuming you say that because most people aren't interested by "hard core philosophy" and feel there are better things to do. However, the same is true of math, science, and literature; most people do not engage in the study of any of these things except to the extent that they are forced to by law. Being "atypical" does not mean you are mentally deranged, prone to hallucination, etc. This is why psychology is not just "mental pathology"; people can end up with very different beliefs but still pass the same basic tests of sanity. 

1. E.g. if "common sense" says that down, the direction in which things fall, is an absolute direction, the surface of the Earth could not be curved and thus a round Earth, where down is relative to the center, would be highly "counter intuitive". 

All is not lost, it seems, but merely in turmoil. Note this seems to be dialectical reasoning. The theory of aesthetics Russell presents here was probably not rigorously thought out (or intended to be taken as a formal theory), but the work is interesting as a commentary on a particular time and place, including the status of its art and artists. 

Are the "worse kind of cynics" I mentioned earlier, wherein culture is ultimately a means to an end (of their own particular religious vision); they probably show a varying level of intolerance toward other religions as well. Do not want their own religiosity associated with or compared to Scientology. These people are sort of #1 in disguise (and will tend to invoke a similar-but-softer cynical/political form of reasoning). 

But, as others have pointed out, this is the equivalent of Mary actually going to the art gallery. In order to have this new knowledge of an experience, Mary must first have it -- whether this is via an art gallery trip or the simulation of same does not make any difference to the argument, namely that complete knowledge of the explanation of how an experience works is not the same as knowledge of the experience itself. However, this does not seem like a strong objection to physicalism, only epistemological hair splitting. 

The reason interpretations of quantum mechanics are more often associated with philosophy rather than science (truly, some scientists think it is all just metaphysical questions with no verifiable answer so it's nonsense to talk about them) is due to the fact that the interpretations focus on discussing the ontological and epistemological status on quantum mechanics, not the formalism. Science is the cycle of collecting data, analyzing the data, coming up with predictive models and formulas that allow us to make accurate predictions, and then preforming experiments that verify or contradict those predictions. Quantum mechanics, so far, has provided the most well tested physical theory we have ever achieved and it has done so without settling the ontological status of wave function collapses, so many scientists think the answer to this question genuinely does not matter. There are many different interpretations but there are two that stand out as the most popular today. One is referred to as the Copenhagen interpretation and the other is the many-worlds interpretation. From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: 

The logical form of an axiom is its syntax. P -> Q is the specified syntax that we are looking for, in our example. So, any formulae that has the syntax of P -> Q where P and Q are both formulae, is of that same logical form. 

In general, most objections to a naive acceptance of existence as a property are due to the acceptance coming with some very undesirable or contradictory conclusions. For example, the second order predicate existence that Russell and Frege later formulated is based off of a descriptivist theory of reference, and the flaws of that theory are well documented. Ultimately, it is still very dubious as to whether or not anyone, including Gödel, have provided a sufficient and acceptable definition of an existence predicate. Even more so, many deny that existence is trivial for any case (see the paper by Kripke mentioned above.) 

A good place to start would be the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article Jacques Lacan as well as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article Jacques Lacan (1901—1981). The SEP article has a very comprehensive bibliography listing both primary and secondary literature relating to Lacan's ideas. The IEP article has an entire section devoted to Lacan's ideas about "subject" which starts by asserting:
