I'm not sure a rational state actor would be capable of performing an accurate cost-benefit analysis, any more so than world governments were able to predict how the personal computer, then the Internet changed the world. But assuming they did, what should they look for? - security: information security has three axes - availability, privacy, and accuracy; there are data protection techniques other than encryption that span this spectrum. A computer does not have to cough up data just because someone has provided a password. It can refuse to answer questions unless a host of authentication challenges (factors) are met. Data at rest or in transit can be protected using algorithms that rely on the algorithm's secrecy, limiting who may participate in the exchange. Current encryption technology only does the high powered encryption on the key part of the message. The bulk of the data is stored using the simple key that is better protected. The reason we do this is because it is computationally expensive to do otherwise. However, in a world where more computational power is available, then every bit could be protected. Also, of course, we can add bits to our keys making brute forcing take even more time. A good security analyst could do a more thorough job here, but there are plenty options available. I would not assume that computer security is hopeless. Contrast against possible growth. Even if unprotected, additional computing power opens up huge new horizons in chemistry (predictive modeling of reactions and the ability search for reactions that might yield materials with desired properties), engineering (more realistic environments to test vehicles and structures in simulation without the cost of prototyping), art (computer generated music (sadly), performers, maybe even whole products), medicine (better ability to model health and drug effects), genetics and genetic engineering using things like CRISPR, civics (AI-aided social networks), city planning, and finance, just to name the first few I could think of. I think a rational state would recognize that it is incapable of evaluating either the cost or benefit effectively and just go with their guiding principle - be it hands-off or micromanaging. Regarding tech companies: they are currently positioning themselves like ABC, CBS, and NBC did back in the radio age, as gatekeepers of the technology. They will seek the government enact rules preserving their dominant role. Depending on their success in this regard, the center of innovation will move to whatever geographic region provides the most minds the lowest barrier to entry. 

What are some elements of the classic zombie's metabolism that we could interfere with? Dead Think we'll have to assume this one isn't true. Cell death is exploding cell membranes leaving a big thing of goo roughly shaped like someone you once knew. For zombism to be curable, there still needs to be a person beneath the disease. No Pulse Could be your zombie microbe excretes a surfactant(s) that helps keep nutrients flowing in and waste flowing out. An ingredient that disrupt these would be helpful. Hungry Could be your zombie microbe also excretes insulin to convert sucrose into glucose for the quick growth of the microbe, and might be one of the key things that maintains the microbes dominance. An insulin suppressor could starve the microbe (and the host) of the biological energy it needs. Incoherent Rage Could be the other body chemistry changes send the brain spinning. Some antipsychotics might be effective in giving the host a chance to get a grip. Penicillin There may be some magic ingredient, like penicillin that interferes with only the microbes ability to hold it's cell membrane together. Maybe combined with an insulin suppresor to slow growth so that the antibiotic can be effective. Cardio Stimulator Nothing is restarting the heart, so your heroes will need to do that. Bringing It All Together The zombie microbes circulatory system, a series of chemical surfactants, may act as a barrier to treatment - expelling other treatment agents as soon as their administered. A TBD counter surfactant interferes with the zombie circulatory system resisting treatment. Something that inhibits insulin is administered to slow down the reproduction rate of the microbe. A targetted antibiotic then goes to work killing off the infection. An antipsychotic maybe not only helps the zombie to function, but helps assure chemical signals to the heart are once again being received clearly. At just the right time, the heart is externally restarted with a shock. Just realized you're looking for an immunization. 

Your continent could be floating on a very large magma chamber. Eruptions elsewhere in the region could empty the chamber, causing it to settle. Net result, the land mass peacefully slides to a lower elevation (possibly underwater) Cooling Mantle Causing Plate to Settle Alternatively, the entire mantle could cool causing settling of all plates. 

A tent can be poleless (just canvas as rope), the canvas being stretched across a natural depression or between trees, or could rely on a single or two posts (all of which could fit on a horse). 

Caloric Needs According to CalorieKing for a 6 foot 2 inch, 330 pound male orc, aged 20 years and doing heavy labor you'd need about 4,000 to 4,200 calories per day to maintain weight (3,200 to 3,400). For comparison to an average human at between 2,000 to 2,500, the food need is between 1.5x to 2x. That calorie need can be cut to 3,400 to 3,600 calories (and when I say calories, I'm meaning kilocalories) per day by cutting their lifestyle from heavy labor (my base assumption) to light labor. 1.a.) Generally, it's believed that about 4 acres of land was needed to produce enough crop for 1 person for the year. Given that, I'd say orcs would require an average of 7 acres per person or 6 people per square kilometer, using your metric. 1.b.) I think the problem with stronger slaves is more about securing a population of slaves that is twice as strong as the guards, not calories. Culture 2.a.) The population difference isn't so severe as to completely rule out larger social forms. 2.b.) The population could still resolve conflicts through ritualized violence: wrestling matches, counting coup, or pre-Shaka African "wars" which were mostly two armies exchanging largely useless spear volleys and going home. Alternatively, the scottish (and some medieval brits) used feats of strength or skill (caber tossing, hammer throwing, olympics) to compete. 2.c.) Larger creatures (see the Rakshasas of Hindu myth or Goliath) tended to be portrayed as more reliant on the own capability (more atheist). This is encountered by real-world examples of the Norse and the Dinka, who are both as religious as any other culture. I'm inclined to say size has no effect. Military 3.) Your stronger orcs will be able to, if they choose to, wear nearly twice as much armor. That might be enough to become fairly immune to arrows and even stand up nicely to notRoman piercing swords, spears from charioteers, and cavalry charges. If your orcs adopt the shield wall tactics of their notRoman southern neighbors, it might be able to hold against traditional wall-breakers : cavalry and chariots. A heavy warhorse (Shire) weighs up to 2,200 pounds. Not impossible for a small (2 to 3) group of your strong 330 pound strong orcs (assuming they can lift twice their weight) to throw down. Now in Gallic lands, your orcs are well positioned to adopt chain maille from the Gauls before the notRomans do. In between these two groups of innovators, if orcs are paying attention, they may adopt the best of both cultures ahead of the humans. Also, the larger strength and bigger size would allow orcs to draw heavier bows, pull farther, allowing them to have superior range and hitting ability as archers. 

There are too many variables and not enough information provided. When you say interstellar space, you are talking about travel between stars. For this to happen in any meaningful time frame, your ship has to be travelling a not-trivial fraction of the speed of light. Without enough fuel to slow down, the ship will fly right past an entire star system. The ship must be in good enough shape to slow down AND navigate into a planetary orbit. The default condition would be to not slow down enough, and skip right by. Secondly, if the whole crew is in suspended animation, who is making the decision to land? Easy answer could be the ship computer. Why would it want to land? If it was in good enough shape to enter a solar system and enter a planetary orbit, why land? In most cases, space or a comet or asteroid is safer. You could pick up the raw materials you need from almost any of these without getting dangerously close to a gravity well or atmosphere. Third, what is uncharted space? If the crew is in suspended animation and travelling at sub-light speeds, they are practically limited to around less than one hundred light years from Earth (very well charted, although we do find something new every now and again). If you can shed the velocity, and if you can enter a stable orbit, and if you can use enough fuel to slow down for entry - provided you slow down enough, you won't heat up at all. It's only because most entry vehicles hit the upper atmosphere at several times the speed of sound that they undergo heating. This is because they don't extra fuel to do the braking, they let the atmosphere do it for them. It doesn't matter if it is a water landing or a ground landing, if your vehicle hits at much over forty miles per hour, the likelihood of the vehicle made out of conventional materials surviving is low. Then again, you could have inertial dampeners which protect the crew inside from the shock and an unobtanium metal frame that can take the hit. Perhaps the parachute doesn't malfunction until just a few feet before the landing, but why if you have so much advanced technology do you have a parachute? 

If range is line-of-site, your infantry men could be parked at high elevation to taser the enemy from far beyond archer range. Defensively, they could be stationed on high walls and towers Catapults could lob jars of oil, that these units could light after delivery from any range. As infantry, these people could break shield walls (because they can taser the person holding the shield) and break lines of pike men (because their power reaches past the spear). In these formations, it's vital that every soldier maintain their place (which they can't do if zapped to the ground and writhing). This would make them an alternative to cavalry (whose job is the same thing, but they expose themselves to personal injury to do it). These could also be used to open a hole in a pike wall to allow cavalry through to rush archers or demolish dismounted infantry. This kind of unit could also be useful as anti-armor. As Game of Thrones well showed, a knight in full metal armor is nearly untouchable by anything except a set pike, lance or javelin. Your pyromancer could just zap the armored unit and he is down, where weaker infantry could pull off the armor or drown him/her in muck. This unit could also be excellent anti-cavalry, either zapping the mount or zapping the knight off his horse. Since cavalry move quickly, they are very challenging for anyone else to engage, but your pyromancers could dismount them accurately with a glance. You could also use your pyromancers as anti-seige. They could zap enemy soldiers on ladders, keeping them stuck and blocking their comrades from ascending. They could zap whatever is pulling towers (provided it is in line of sight), zap catapult/trebuchet crews, light enemy oil while it is still in the trebuchet (causing explosions in the enemy ranks).
