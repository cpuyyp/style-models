Because let $g=r$ we would have $\alpha f+ (1-\alpha)g \sim \beta f+ (1-\beta)g$, when $\alpha =\frac{1}{2}$ and $\beta =1$ we would have $\frac{1}{2} f+ \frac{1}{2}g \sim f$ which contradicts with the RP. Similar arguments apply to two mixtures whose probability weights are cyclic permutations of one another. Hence, it seems to me the current MS combined with RP can only give us the equivalence between 2-lottery mixtures, what if I need to randomize more than 2 lotteries, and compare different mixtures? The above 3-lottery version axiom is not right, but it does not say there is no 3 ore more lottery version, it may take other form. So the question is, how should I generalize the MS to higher dimension if possible? Can I decompose a n-lottery mixture into a sequence of 2-lottery mixture? BTW, I use MS to replace the Independence axiom, which states: if $f \sim g$, then $\alpha f+ (1-\alpha) r \sim \alpha g+ (1-\alpha) r$. Without this Independence axiom, if we have $a \sim b$, $c \sim d$, I am not sure whether we can have $\alpha a+ (1-\alpha) c \sim \alpha b+ (1-\alpha) d$. While Uzi's original construction uses all extreme/dictatorial allocation to construct all possible general allocations via the Independence axiom, how can I instead use MS and RP to do so? Anyone studied this paper before? I am not sure how many technique and model details I should post, I can add more if you want to discuss. The main construction and proof is on page 586 of the paper(dictatorships). 

India still has a low-cost workforce, so they do export items where cost is very important (e.g. clothing, sneakers). More importantly, India exports services (call centers, software offshoring) because it's much easier to lay down fiber optic cable than to build a railroad so certain cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore) have developed strong export services industries which do not need to depend on a lot of outside physical infrastructure to create viable exports. 

The second part of your question is around follow-on economic effects. Using the dynamics above you can infer the likely effects. Raising capital requirements had the effect of exactly that. It also had the effect of requiring larger volume of QE to counteract the drag on lending (in effect, money velocity or money multipler) cause by the higher reserve requirements. Had QE not been sufficient to overcome the higher capital reserves, you would have seen bank balance sheets swell while lending remained low....which is exactly what happened in the early to mid stages of QE while banks shored up their balance sheets before timidly starting to lend at risk again. 

Profit is revenue minus costs. So we have $q = 12500$ and $p = 35$. (Note that I'm assuming you've correctly figured this out.) Then we have revenue: $$R = \int_{0}^{12500} MR dq = \int_{0}^{12500} (60 - 0.004q)dq$$ And costs: $$C = 300000 + \int_{0}^{12500} 10dq = 300000 + 125000 = 425000$$ The profit is $\Pi = R - C$. The average cost is $C/12500$. I leave you to crunch the integrals. Edit: In looking at your problem, $p(q) = 60 - 0.002q$ is definitely an inverse demand function. The revenue $R = qp(q) = (60q - 0.002q^{2})$ (quantity times prices). This yields the profit maximization problem (maximizing with respect to quantity produced): $$\max_{q} qp(q) - c(q) = (60q - 0.004q^{2}) - 10q - 300000$$ The First Order Conditions are: $$60 - 0.004q - 10 = 0 \implies 60 -0.004q = 10$$ You did the work from there to solve for $q$. 

In a Bayesian game, information is incomplete. To cope, players have beliefs about the state of the game. In a sense, each player strategizes as if the game was as he or she believes. So each player operates in his or her own world. And if every player plays a Nash equilibrium in one's own world, that's a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In a stochastic game, the information about the current state of the game may indeed be public. At a given time step, the next state is determined by the current state, the strategy profile played at that time step, and some stochastic process (like a Markov chain, for example). We can have a stochastic Bayesian game where information is incomplete and there is a stochastic switching device like a Markov chain. 

India has significantly worse physical/logistics infrastructure than China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, so it is difficult to produce goods in India because it's difficult to move supplies and product around the country. This, coupled with the comparatively higher complexity of dealing with government bureaucracy, makes it challenging to manufacture products in India for export. Here is the World Bank's 2014 Logistics Performance Index for the countries, which illustrates the significant competitive disadvantage India has compared to China and others. 

The field of performance marketing makes ample use of attachment bias. For example, skiers often purchase race-level ski boots and skis which are too stiff relative to their ability, so the product is actually detrimental to performance. In this case, self-attachment bias causes buyers to overestimate their own ability. The ski manufacturers know this and market and price the stiffness of this equipment at a premium even though it is not objectively helpful for the vast majority of consumers. In pharmaceuticals, attachment bias to familiar medications like Tylenol cause consumers to pay premiums for this medicine even while knowing that the generics next to it on the shelves contain exactly the same active ingredients and are often made by the same manufacturers. Here, attachment bias to a familiar product causes allows manufacturers to pay a premium, and the manufacturers tune marketing messages to amplify the attachment bias ("Tylenol, what matters most", "Advil, the original round tablet). 

Optimal allocation refers to whom the seller awards the item, in order to maximize revenue. In a Vickrey auction, it is a Nash equilibrium for everyone to bid their valuations. This is stronger than a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which is the solution concept in Bayesian games (which include auctions). The Bayesian Nash equilibrium is the solution concept in which every player seeks to maximize their expected utilities, subject to their respective beliefs about the world. In the Vickrey auction, agents' beliefs about the world do not really matter. The goal of the Vickrey auction is to illicit truthful responses from the agents. That is, they bid their precise valuations. The first-price auction is revenue-equivalent to the Vickrey auction; however, agents do not truthfully bid their valuations. In particular, if we have a symmetric $n$-player auction where players' valuations are drawn from a probability distribution $F([0, \omega])$ with density $f$, we have the expected revenue for the seller as: $$n \cdot \int_{0}^{\omega} (n-1) \cdot y \cdot f(y) \cdot F^{n-2}(y) \cdot (1-F(y)) dy$$ Combinatorially, we select the highest two bidders in $n(n-1)$ ways, since order matters. Suppose the second highest bid is $y$. This occurs with probability $f(y)$. The remaining $n-2$ players bid less than $y$ with probability $F^{n-2}(y)$. The highest bidder has valuation greater than $y$ with probability $1-F(y)$. Each of these selections are independent; so by rule of product, we multiply. As this is an expected value, we include $y$ in each product. By rule of sum, we add up over each possible value of $y$ (hence, the integral). 

Harsanyi's Utilitarian theorems' has been criticized by Diamond Cardinal Welfare, Individualistic Ethics, and Interpersonal Comparison of Utilities and others that, it is the morally unacceptable for social preference to satisfy the Independence axiom because it would imply that ex ante fairness are of no importance. Epstein and Segal QSWF suggest a Quadratic Social Welfare Function to replace Harsanyi's linear one (weighted sum of individual utilities), equivalently, a "Mixture Symmetry axiom" to replace the Independence axiom. I am trying to use this QSWF & MS axiom to replace the first order social welfare function and Independence axiom in Professor Uzi's another paper Let's agree all dictatorships are equally bad. Professor Uzi's aim of this paper is not about the social welfare's functional form but I would like to see the difference if I made a change as mentioned above. The maximizer(optimal resources allocation)of the weighted sum of individual utilities is invariant to linear transformation $v_i=au_i+b$ in the original paper. From what I can see now, the optimal allocation is not invariant to linear transformation of utilities, but this is yet to be proved. It turns out the main job is about how to replicate the Lemma 4 (in Appendix B) of Pro Uzi's original paper (dictatorships) using Mixture Symmetry instead of Independence axiom. One difficulty is that the MS axiom is given in the case of two lotteries: 

It's hard to make a best advisement given that we don't know your background. One can struggle with proofs for a few reasons: terseness of the presentation, a weak background in the prerequisite material, or a weak background in proof-writing in general. (1) and (3) are generally associated with mathematical maturity. I advise folks interested in economics to pursue an undergraduate degree in mathematics. If that is not feasible or realistic, then I suggest at a minimum some proofs-based work in linear algebra and real analysis. Friedberg's Linear Algebra text is a good exposition and will help you build up some maturity. It's a solid prerequisite for analysis. Once you start talking about the derivative as a linear operator, linear algebra is a must-have. However, linear algebra doesn't otherwise appear in real analysis before that. For analysis, Abbott is friendlier than Rudin, and will likely provide you with sufficient background to move forward. Abbott is geared towards juniors in an undergraduate curriculum, while Rudin is the hard-core senior level text. If you don't have mathematical maturity, Rudin will force you to struggle. Once you have mathematical maturity, the conciseness his writing is quite nice. Fudenberg and Tirole is a very technical, terse book. It is a good reference, but not my favorite exposition into game theory. I might be inclined to look through Maschler, Solan, and Zamir instead. It's gotten good reviews, though I haven't had a chance to look through it myself.So take this with a grain of salt. It is definitely more comprehensive than Fudenberg and Tirole, though. 

Let's look at two companies capable of producing gemstones. Company A has machinery that produces quartz gemstones which it can sell at \$100/stone. It costs $10/stone in raw materials and \$20/stone in operating costs to produce the stones. Company B has uses different machinery, but also produces quartz gemstones with identical \$100/stone sales and identical \$10 + \$20 cost structure per stone. So the companies have the same absolute competitive advantage. However, Company B's machines are more flexible, and can be used to produce diamonds instead of quartz. Here, the diamonds sell for \$10,000/stone and cost a total of \$1,000 in cost to make. Company A's machines are specialized so they can only be used to produce quartz or cheaper and less profitable gemstones. Company B is much better off producing diamonds than quarts. So the opportunity cost of producing quartz is very high for that Company. By contrast, Company A's opportunity cost is very low. So Company A has a comparative competitive advantage over Company B, both by definition and also, hopefully, by intuition. 

When preferences are strict, the strong core is unique and the top-trading cycle procedure (TTCP) is the unique mechanism yielding the strong core allocation. Here are the highlights. Lemma 1: Let $x$ be the allocation generated by the Top-Trading Cycle Procedure. Then $x$ is in the strong core. Lemma 2: Let $P$ be the set of players, $\Omega = \{ \omega^{i} = i : i \in P \}$ be the set of initial allocations, and $\succ^{i}$ be the set of strict preferences. We have $(P, \Omega, (\succ^{i})_{i=1}^{|P|})$ as the instance of the house allocation problem. The strong core is unique. Proof: Suppose to the contrary that there exist two allocations $x, y$ in the strong core and suppose $x$ is the allocation returned by the TTCP. As $x \neq y$, $S = \{ i : x_{i} \neq y_{i} \}$ has at least two elements. Observe that if there is a player $i \in S$ such that $x_{i} \succ^{i} y_{i}$, then $x_{i}$ can form a weakly improving coalition with the other players in $x_{i}$'s cycle whose allocations are the same in $x$ and $y$. As preferences are strict, every player in $S$ strictly prefers either $x$ or $y$. We construct a weakly improving coalition to block $y$. Let $i \in S$ such that $y_{i} \succ^{i} x_{i}$. Let $i$ be matched in iteration $k$ of the TTCP. Since $y_{i} \succ^{i} x_{i}$, we have that player $i$ prefers some other house $j$ to $x_{i}$ and that $j$ was assigned in a previous iteration by the fact that $x$ belongs to the strong core. And so using the allocation $y$ displaces the player who received house $j$ under the TTCP. As preferences are strict, each player who received a house when $j$ was allocated under the TTCP can form a weakly improving coalition to block $y$. And so the fact that $S \neq \emptyset$ implies that $y$ is not in the strong core. QED. I actually have a blog entry going into more detail about this: $URL$
