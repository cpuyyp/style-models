... said the Buddha to people asking him questions that would torn them. Following his example, we should not be careless towards others -- "right speech bullet lists" is just not enough. For example, it's not wise to alienate someone who regard us as dear by selectively implying that the feeling might not be reciprocate (say, when talking about "non-attachment"). It's not fair to expect them to not be hurt, specially when we are the ones who study so intensely the causes of suffering (e.g. "being apart from what is desirable"). And specially when we actively participated in creating that very "attachment" in the other. Another example would be when one uses "non-attachment" as an excuse for "non-commitment", like a green card to be forever unreliable. The list of misuses and misunderstandings goes on. But the point, I think, of the quote above is we should ponder carefully about the benefit (or injuries) our actions and words bring to others. And our responsibility in these acts. 

"Especially, the vipassana practitioners say that scanning the body and finding no atman or self in it is proof that self doesn't exist." The reasoning of said practitioners is flawed -- otherwise, I could claim absurdities like "there is no sun" after scanning my body and not finding a burning star in it. "But what about the practitioner himself who is scanning or performing the vipassana? Doesn't that imply that he himself is the soul?" If you regard soul to be a "fixed, non-changing, eternal self, ...", it doesn't. The implication would only hold if you'd show that "it" is fixed, non-changing, eternal, under your complete control ("may it be thus", "may it not be thus"), and not a source of dukkha. These are the characteristics often ascribed to atman. "So, how can you argue that soul doesn't exist when Buddha himself didn't deny it (or accept it either)?" More was said about this: 

I've seen meditators of many different schools talking about the importance of not walking away from a "bad" sitting. All books I've read reflect this commitment. All monks I've heard too. Conversely, I never heard or read a single meditator to take this issue lightly as in "well, if you are not much up to it, sure, maybe some other day". There are certainly a number of reasons for abandoning a specific practice. A big one, is that we might be doing it in some improper way, or in a way that increases unwholesome states, hindrances and/or decreases faculties associated to meditation. 

I'm not sure about "Buddhist leaders", but in general, I think that's not so much the case. Also, a lot of books are written precisely because of the presence of misleading books. To the point of having titles like Buddhism Is Not What You Think (though I never fully read this one, I find it unfortunate that, carrying such title, it barely and only loosely quotes the Buddha). I think what a reasonable person should do in this case is what she would do in any other case, when circumstances are appropriate: point to contrary evidence. 

There is a large body of texts of discourses of the Buddha touching on lay life issues. Below, I paste a (probably not exhaustive) list of suttas compiled by a user from dhammalwheel forum. There's also an upcoming book from Bhikkhu Bodhi presenting a collection of suttas of discourses of the Buddha dealing with lay life themes: The Buddha's Teachings on Social and Communal Harmony: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon. 

Karma and rebirth were beliefs of his time, and the Buddha repeated those just as means to point his listeners to a deeper truth, but he himself did not agree with those beliefs. 

Consider a person who lights a candle. What caused the fire to light up? This is a very difficult question. Was it the person? The lighter? His parents who gave him birth? Certainly not the candle wick. But it's the candle wick (or generally, the fuel) in the Buddha's analogies, that stands for the condition for the fire to keep burning. In other words, that which, when present, keeps the flame going, and when absent, have the fire to cease -- that's the Buddha strategy for closing up on the problem of dukkha. Not the events that led the flame to become (e.g. the person lighting it up), nor the events that led the fire to cease (e.g. water thrown at it). In D.O. terms, the sense of vision does not arise when there is not a healthy organ like an eye. Simply as that. But when eye is present, and eye-consciousness is present, and forms are present, contact is subject to arising. With the absence of any of the three, say, any present contact cease and there is no possibility for a new contact to arise. Thus, provided that dukkha is dependent (not caused by) craving and D.O. holds, if one finds a way to cease craving without reminder, than dukkha won't ever find support again. The question then, is whether or not one believes it's possible to cease craving without reminder. But it should be clear that if the relations hold, there's no possibility for dukkha to rise again. Whether Nirvana is "caused" by the practitioner practicing or not, and what this says about Nirvana is irrelevant -- the "unconditional" quality that buddhists refer to and assign to Nirvana has no relation to this "causality", after all. To further illustrate, if we apply the same reasoning of "causes as conditions" you gave to show that Nirvana is conditioned, we can reach even more absurd conclusions. For example, are our parents the cause we were born? Then, according to D.O., should we fall on the ground and die as soon as our parents die? Or is our birth caused by their intercourse? So, should we have ceased to be as soon as they stopped that intercourse as per D.O.? If what caused me to know arithmetic is studying, should I forget everything about it once I take a break? And so on... 

A deeper understanding would involve being able to follow up on the chain of events for a particular stimulus: from the arising of consciousness, to contact, to feeling and, then, to craving, etc. Finally, this practice also should lead to a certain degree of equanimity, as per the last sentence: 

As someone who is not a doctor, but only familiar with DBT (a form of CBT) and who was close to people with disorders who relied on such therapy: hardly. While "mindfulness meditation" is considered an important and integral practice in the process, I personally think is nowhere near an adequate substitute of the entire therapy program. I also don't know of any research suggesting the remission efficacy of disorders with meditation only vs. CBT (or DBT). 

Emphasis are mine. These are strong hints. From my understanding, stiffness, rigidity, force should be absent -- only the minimum should be allowed so one doesn't fall on the ground, or sleep; any small amount of extra effort disturbs the mind. 

Basically, he is saying that being virtuous has, at least, benefits here in this very life. And if turns out there are intrinsic harmful effects of evil actions, one won't suffer them because one does not do them. Now, if there is another life after death conditioned by the previous one, the effects of bad actions won't drag one to a suffering realm. So, in essence, being virtuous is a win-win situation. Notice the Buddha is not asking the Kālāmas to believe rebirth at face value. He is just teaching them to be intelligent with their choices in a situation where they don't have the knowledge to be certain about things they are uncertain. "Most people and monks dont question every doctrine. They use it as Thanissaro Bhikkhu said as a "working hypothesis" and therefore filter out any contrary evidence. What I mean by this is that they are succumbed to an argument of authority." I think there are people who take what the texts and their teachers say as "working hypothesis" and put them to test. There are also people who take them as authority. And there are people who take them as authority and filter out contrary evidence. Perhaps the majority is in the blind belief side. Then again, for one example, I read it's pretty much the same scenario in the mathematics circles when Bertrand Russell was studying, when no one questioned the foundations of mathematics or saw it's fragility. It was pure blind belief. Cracking wrong beliefs is not an easy thing, anywhere. 

Here's a short pdf on breathing. This is what I read that made me look for authoritative resources (as I realized I know nothing about breathing). I ended up buying Breath Well, Be Well by Robert Fried, Ph.D, which I'm still reading. 

As the phrasing is stated, no, he avoided such a general remark. In fact, he criticized those who think that way through a common phrase found in the pali canon: "Only this is true, anything else is wrong". For example, in MN 95, we read him saying: 

And then he goes on to summarize the conflicting views of "whole body", but doesn't really take any position, just sees them as useful alternatives. Finally, Analayo writes on his PhD-thesis-turned-book on the Satipatthana sutta: 

It's important to note that equanimity is not some kind of passivity as if one should remain idle when facing a threat to one's health. One should still take care of one self and others equanimously － instead of trying to take care of oneself and others moved by fear, despair, anger or craving. Another related sutta is the The Arrow which illustrates the differences between pain and suffering. 

Perhaps in said video, he could have talked about "stream of consciousness", which is not the same thing: in one sutta (and apparently nowhere else?) the respective term, "viññāṇa-sota", appears: 

"I can sit there and experience what it feels like to be lonely and make peace with that or I can take action to make new friends so that I feel more connected and thus less lonely. If I do the latter then aren't I accomplishing, gratifying etc?" Yes, it does seem so. "Surely it's a good thing to make efforts to connect." Yeah, if you put effort into connecting, and you end up having company, surely this is the gratification of that. Instead of framing the conclusion here as "Buddhism seems to be saying it's all in your own head", I would only say at this point that this gratification is temporary. So, from the buddhist perspective, I agree with you when you say that "We think that accomplishing, achieving, attaining will make us happier but we are misguided.", but only if the happiness you refer to is one not subject to vanishing -- Nirvana. Otherwise, that's not quite true: accomplishing, achieving and attaining can makes us happy, it's just that it's a happiness that has an expiration date, a happiness that is subject to disappear -- often too soon -- and a happiness that is not really that satisfying in it's essence. "but then if this is so why try to change anything? Why go out and try to make new friends when I feel lonely? Why go out and try to make money when I don't have enough? Etc etc. doing these things creates a better life, one of less struggle." Indeed, these are efforts for creating a better life with less struggle. We may be able to lessen the struggle like this, but one might wonder if one can eliminate it, like Gotama wondered: 

The noble eightfold path is not 8 limbs constituted of "meditation". Only one limb, strictly speaking, is focused on meditation. Meditation just happens to be a trendy topic that attracts the attention of a lot of people nowadays. 

A well known sutta on this subject is the The Arrow which illustrates the differences between pain and suffering. Thus, pain could be understood as simply bodily discomfort (even if sharp), but unable to do anything beyond that, say, to his mind (which is naturally not the case for any "normal" person). However, like in the foot episode, he does appear managing these discomforts: 

There is a reason the teachings list things to develop and be aware of (eightfold path, enlightenment factors, jhana factors, five hindrances, etc). Any one of them underdeveloped may lead us astray. One thing is to lose interest towards random things. Other is to lose interest, enthusiasm and energy in general. The first is not a problem in itself. The second is a problem, which can probably develop into depression. A person who loses interests in "mundande" things, but has strong interest and enthusiasm in buddhism often finds himself/herself considering the monastic life. A person who, in general, is not enthusiastic, is not interested, has no willpower, might find trouble when trying to do anything at all.
