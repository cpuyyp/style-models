Looking at gold values is simply cherry-picking. From 1970 to 1980, the CPI went from 38.8 to 82.4, an increase of 112%, and an annualized rate of 7.8%. Your chart shows housing prices increasing about 200%, an annualized rate of about 11.6%. So while most of the price increase was due to inflation, there are 3.8 percentage points that remain unexplained. One can also compare the dollar to other currencies. While the $/Â£ rate fluctuated a lot in this period, from 1970 to 1980, overall the dollar actually strengthened against the pound slightly, and from 1970 to 1976 its strength more than doubled. The Yen exchange seems to show the opposite trend, however. 

Is the cost given the marginal or cumulative cost? If it's the cumulative cost, then the profit is pq-C(q): your price is money per item, so you have to multiply by the number of items to find the total gross revenue. The problem is then to maximize the profit, i.e. find $\max_{q} pq-C(q)$. If C(q) is the marginal cost, then the marginal profit is marginal revenue minus marginal cost, i.e. marginal profit = p-C(q). The FOC is that the firm should keep selling the product until selling more would cause their marginal profit to go negative. For a continuous function to go from positive to negative, it has to go through zero. Thus, the FOC is that their marginal profit be zero. While the marginal profit going from positive to negative means that it's going through zero, going through zero doesn't necessarily mean that you're going from positive to negative; you still have to check which direction it's going. So the SOC is that the marginal profit be decreasing. FOC: marginal profit = 0 SOC: marginal profit decreasing If the marginal profit is decreasing, then when it hits zero, it's going from positive to negative. 

To me, this reads as follows: for an individual, the demand function answers, for all values of $p$, the question: "if the price is $p$ per unit, how many units $q(p)$ would the individual buy?" As an example, let's consider my personal demand curve $q = 10-p$ for a certain good. I would interpret that, also with the above definition, as follows: if the price is 10/unit or more, I purchase nothing. If it is 7/unit, I'll purchase 3 units. The big point here is that this seems to imply, that I'd pay 7/unit for each of the 3 units. Is that correct? Things would be different if I were faced with a situation in which I had to pay more for the first 2 units. In that case, I might decide to buy less than 3 units. And I wouldn't be contradicting my demand function. At least, not, if it were as I interpreted the definition. Alternative: it seems less close to the text, yet much more convenient to the mathematics, to interpret the demand function in the following way. The demand function answers, for all values of $q$, the question: "if an individual already has $q-1$ units, how much would he be willing to pay for unit $q(p)$?" (or, as an integral, "if an individual already has an amount $q$, how much would $p(q)$ be, with $p(q)dq$ the amount he's willing to pay for an additional amount $dq$?"). Thanks! 

[I can't possibly compete with the credentials of Brian Romanchuk so I write this answer simply to continue the discussion.] Isn't there an argument based on maturity transformation? Maturity transformation is that process by which banks create long terms loans from short term deposits. So, equity share price analysts will take about how a steeper yield curve is good for the profits of banks because banks pay interest at a 90-day rate whilst making loans at a longer rate, say 10yr on average (think of a mix of 5yr personal loans and up to 30 yr mortgages). When the yield curve flattens, i.e. when long rates minus short rates falls then making loans becomes less profitable. If the yield curve inverts and shorter rates are more expensive than longer rates then (ceterus paribus) what is the incentive for banks to make an unprofitable loan? Further, at any given time loans are being paid off and loans are being created, if there is a cessation of new loans whilst old loans are being paid off then one can see how there will be a drop in M3 (the higher money supply indicators). This is capital shallowing aka. disinvestment and that would (could?) cause a recession. So there are issues with this theory. Loans do not take place at the risk free rate, each borrower pays a rate higher based on counterparty risk. Other factors include corporate strategy where one bank intends to drive competitors out of business with deliberately predatory (and unprofitable) pricing. That is why I added ceterus paribus in the italicised paragraph above. This is my pet theory; I have not read it in a textbook. Yield curve flattening and potential yield curve inversion arises recurrently on business television but they hardly ever explain the transmission mechanism to a recession (if one exists). Recently, I heard one economist propose my theory on Bloomberg but he was disputed by another economist, so this is not orthodox economics view. I'd love to know the real answer. UPDATE: In this interview with Bloomberg Ray Dalio says a "flatter yield curve causes a constraint in the economy and a constraint in lending" ~4:10 to ~4:50. UPDATE2: New Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his first press conference says the effects of inverted yield curve on inter-mediation are hard to find in the research data but nonetheless those are issues that they'll be watching carefully. 

Footnotes: 1: This gives us another way to come to the formula. Consider the buyer, which buys a quantity $q$ when the average price per unit is $P(q)$. As he buys a quantity $q+\text{d}q$ when the price per unit is $P(q+\text{d}q)$, the total cost increases by $P(q+\text{d}q) - P(q)$, which means that is the utility of the additional unit $\text{d}q$. So, the marginal utility per unit is $\frac{(q+\text{d}q)\cdot P(q+\text{d}q)-q\cdot P(q)}{\text{d}q}$. Using the inverse demand function $P(q)=25-q$, this is turns out to be $25-2q$. 

In the discussions with Kun it seems we've found a satisfying answer. TL;DR: it is as I suggested in the last paragraph of my question. Long answer: This is becoming a bit of an overkill for a question that could be looked up in a couple of minutes, but it's an interesting exercise to see if we can up with the correct answer ourselves. What are we trying to accomplish again? We have 

So, I was pondering the weakness of the UK economy (I am British) and its lagging productivity performance. I was thinking that capital deployed per worker would be an explanatory variable. Looking at figures from www.tradingeconomics.com: Gross Fixed Capital Formation data : Germany |United Kingdom|France|United States. Dividing through by population (proxy for working population) I get the following per capita figures 

Do the proponents of free globalised trade expect the price of labor to converge? Is there evidence of convergence? When will meaningful convergence arrive (example metric EM labor being paid no less than half DM labor)? 

If the Sterling/dollar exchange before Brexit were used then the three European economies are very close to each at $1800. But the key standout is the USA figure its miles ahead. So I am now wondering why is United States Gross Capital Formation per capita so far ahead of the big 3 European economies? 

Suppose a camera is made in Japan and sold in the US. If the maker of the camera wants 10k Yen for it, and the ultimate buyer is paying dollars, then somewhere along the line, dollars have to be exchanged for dollars. For instance, the company that imports the camera might go out and buy 10k Yen, then give the Yen to the company that made the camera. They then pass on the cost of buying the Yen to the camera store, who passes it on to the customer. The dollar being strong with respect to the Yen means that one dollar can buy a lot of Yen. So that means that it doesn't cost very much dollars to buy the 10k Yen, which means that the camera store in the US can sell the camera for fewer dollars, which means that people are more willing to buy the camera, which means that the camera manufacturer gets more business. You're also asking how the strength of the dollar is affected. It's a matter of supply and demand: every time Americans buy stuff from other countries, they are supplying dollars, and every time they sell things to other countries, they are demanding dollars. The strength of the dollar depends heavily then on how much the US exports (which strengthens the dollar) versus imports (which weakens the dollar). Since transactions between the US and other countries involve trading goods and dollars, the effect on the dollar is opposite of how the goods are moving from the US perspective: when someone in the US sells a good, that can be viewed as "buying" dollars, and the US buying goods can be viewed as "selling" dollars. A strong (or "expensive") dollar means that US goods are also expensive, but foreign goods are cheap, and a weak dollar means that US goods are cheap, but foreign goods are expensive. Companies that facilitate exports generally benefit from a weaker dollar (the goods are cheap, so it's easier to sell them). This includes export companies, and people who work in industries whose markets are largely overseas. Companies that facilitate imports generally benefit from a stronger dollar. This includes import companies, and companies that that sell a lot of foreign-sourced goods, which in the camera example would include the camera store. Bonds aren't generally included when calculating exports, but they do have largely the same effect: US treasury bonds are denominated in dollars, so if people in other countries want to buy them, they have to buy dollars, which drives up the value of the dollar. You can think of it in terms of analogy with a household: exports are like people going out and working for a paycheck, while imports are like buying stuff. A bond is like getting a loan, such as a mortgage or a car loan. The more money someone makes at their job, and the more loans they get, the more the cash they have to spend. A dealership wants to help someone get a car loan, because that makes it easier to but a car. Similarly, China and Japan want the US to be able to sell their bonds, because that makes it easier to buy stuff from China and Japan. Whenever China or Japan buy a treasury bond, they give more money to the US, and the US then uses that money to buy stuff. If China were to sell off their bonds, that would make it harder for the US to sell new bonds, which would make it harder for Americans to buy stuff from China. 

Let our thesis be that it is the latter, and let's see if we run into a contradiction. Consumer surplus Let's take the simple straight line $p+q=25$, where a constant unit-price of 5 prescribes a demand of 20: 

The area between the demand curve, $p=5$ and $q=0$, is called the Consumer Surplus CS, and we can calculate it by integration: $$\int_5^\infty Q(p)~\text{d}p=\int_5^{25} (25-p)~\text{d}p$$ This is the same as $$\int_0^{20} (P(q)-5)~\text{d}q=\int_0^{20} \big((25-q)-5\big)~\text{d}q$$ The latter shows the area might be interpreted as the difference between what the consumer is willing to pay and what he is paying -- at least, if our thesis is valid and interpretation (b) holds. We find that the CS in this case is 200. Our thesis can help to interpret this. If the price is 5, the consumer keeps on buying until the additional quantity he could buy does not bring that additional utility of 5. That happens to be at a quantity of 20. Because he was able to buy all units at a price of 5, this represents an advantage: he would have paid more for an additional unit when he still had fewer units. E.g. when he still only had 15 units, he would have paid 10 per unit for additional quantity. Total Willingness To Pay The total willingness to pay TWTP for a quantity $q$ (i.e., the maximum accepted price for that quantity) can be calculated as the sum of the willingness to pay for each subsequent unit until $q$ (i.e., the maximum accepted price per unit for additional units): $$TWTP(q) = \int_0^{q} WTP(q')~\text{d}q'$$ So, in order to calculate how much our buyer would maximally have paid (in total) for those 20 units, we must add the maximum prices for each individual unit. If our thesis is correct and interpretation (b) holds, this is exactly the inverse demand function $P$, so that $$TWTP = \int_0^{20} P(q')~\text{d}q'$$ This Total Willingness To Pay for 20 units happens to be 300 in our case. Now, under normal circumstances the buyer does not need to pay that amount for 20 units, but rather $5\cdot20=100$. The difference between the two is the CS of 200. This is the area above the $p=5$ line, which is what we would expect. Should we have perfect price discrimination, the seller of the good would know the buyer's demand curve, and sell him each unit of the good at exactly the maximum price he'd be willing to pay for it; gradually dropping the price with the buyer's marginal utility: $p=25-q$. That way, the seller is able to capture all of the CS, and the buyer would thus pay 300 for the 20 units. If our thesis is wrong This interpretation only works if our thesis is correct and the inverse demand function $P$ describes the willingness to pay for each additional unit. If it describes the willingness to pay per unit for that and all previous units, i.e. interpretation (a), things are different. In that case, the TWTP for $q$ units is simply the multiplication of $q$ and $P(q)$: $$TWTP(q) = q\cdot P(q)$$ In order to figure out how much would be bought at non-uniform pricing, we need to find the willingness to pay for each unit. That WTP is, as can be seen from the first equation, the derivative of the TWTP, so, in this case: $$WTP(q)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}q}qP(q)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}q}(25q-q^2)=25-2q$$ So, the first quantity is sold at a unit price of 25, just like before. This makes sense, as the buyer does not have any units yet, so the marginal price equals the average price. Then, however, under perfect price discrimination, the price of the good should drop twice as fast as we have previously calculated. That is due to the fact that the additional unit $\text{d}q$, that the seller is trying to sell, does not have a marginal utility given by its price (as is the case in interpretation (b)) but by the increase in total price.1 Moreover, in this situation, the seller sells his last unit for a price of 5, which is when he has sold only 10 units (compared to 20 if interpretation (b) is correct). The buyer has then spent $\int_0^{10} (25-2q)~\text{d}q=150$, which is his TWTP, but for 10 units. This too makes sense: the demand curve prescribes a maximally accepted (average) unit price of 15 - which is exactly what is being paid. What we cannot see anywhere, is the figure of 200 which is the area above the $p=5$ line. In fact, the Consumer Surplus that was 200 in the case of interpretation (b), is actually 0 in the case of interpretation (a) -- simply because of the way the inverse demand function is defined to be the maximum average unit price: if we have a uniform price, the price is the average price, and the buyer will have an incentive to buy more as long as his willingness to pay is higher than the price. Exactly when he buys the quantity $q$ that, on his demand curve, corresponds to the offered price $p$, is the average price he's willing to pay equal to the offered price. Because the average price he's willing to pay, times the quantity, is the total price he's willing to pay for that quantity, and because that also equals the price he is paying at that point in the curve, his CS is 0. Conclusion In order to have a sensible interpretation of the area between the demand curve, $p=5$ and $q=0$, called the Consumer Surplus CS, we need to interpret the inverse demand function to mean: "the price per unit $p$ that the consumer is willing to pay for an additional amount $\text{d}q$, given a possession of $q$ units" (b). The common interpretation (a) as "the price per unit $p$ that the consumer is willing to pay, for each unit, for a the total quantity $q$" is incorrect. It's easy to see, however, why it is often interpreted that way. Firstly, it is a simpler interpretation that's easier to visualise, and secondly, in everyday situations -- which all have uniform pricing -- it still predicts the correct quantity to be traded. 

That Mexicans workers get paid less US workers is a dynamic which motivates the moving of production to Mexico. This idea can be abstracted to Developed Markets (DM) labor and Emerging Markets (EM) labor. This is driving many recent political upsets. 

So folding in some feedback from commenters about 'why should they?'. Isn't this case analogous to supernormal profits being competed away? 

Sorry if this is a birds and the bees type question. Where does capital come from? And I am not talking human capital (which to my mind is skills basically). I suppose I'm taking about financial capital. So, I think one can create personal capital by choosing not to consume, i.e. save. Also I think retained profits are another (and I was wondering perhaps the ultimate) source of capital. If we look at the capital structure of a company then bank loans, corporate bonds and equity capital are all invested, retained profits are internally generated capital. External corporate capital, to my mind, comes from household savings. I know there is the external sector but can we simplify the problem by excluding this? Let us consider the closed economy only. I suppose I'm asking for a theory of capital. I know Marxists have a view and they are welcome to give an updated view (please no re-hash of nineteenth century economic theory, bring it up to date please). I also think that the Austrian school is critical of Keynesians because the former says the latter have no theory of capital. Need illuminating in the capitalism facts of life. Thanks. I wish there was a tag 'meta-economics' or 'philosophy of economics' to describe this question.
