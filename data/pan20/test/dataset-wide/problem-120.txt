This prevents paradoxes, it also means that the primary timeline can never have examples of backward time travel. It also means that you can never go home, never undo the damage you've done, only get slowly further and further away from the world you knew. Another popular option being 

There's a general theme here of aggressively closing loopholes, but in practice you want to open a new loophole. Remember that the drive of the wealthy is to increase and retain control of their wealth. If you push them too hard they'll leave for some overseas tax haven. Give them new loopholes to use to keep them interested in playing your games. Consider a loophole that for example, allows the family to bypass almost all inheritance taxes if the family wealth is held by a trust but only if there are at least 32* trustees. Add a quirk that means the trustees can be no more distantly related than second cousins and it becomes advantageous for the family to be larger while occasionally buying out and spinning off "junior" branches as they become too distantly related to the "senior" line. Allow this mechanism to also protect the family wealth from divorce proceedings, something along the lines of each individual while apparently wealthy is merely being supported by the trust and has minimal personal assets, they're merely being allowed to live in trust properties while acting as a trustee. This can be emphasised by keeping entire branches of the family living in single large buildings. Should any behaviour bring disrepute to the trust they will be removed from the position and income cut off and evicted from the property. Getting divorced counts as behaviour liable to bring the trust into disrepute. *arbitrary value significantly larger than the average family unit 

In fact you could have a society of mixed blocks of 4 and 5 and the insular nature of each one looks the same from the outside and they'd be able to trade between them. However the quirk of making these work safely requires a highly agrarian rather than industrialised society i.e. generating all your own food and not actually dependent on trade for survival. 

The army keeps things like dragons and giants far enough away from the major cities that people who stay close to the centre of the civilisations will hear stories of wolves in the night, but won't be out after dark away so they'll never see one. Anything else will be legends of far off places. Remember that this is the job of a standing army, not a job for roaming adventurers. If a dragon has a hunting range of 20miles, then the army must go 20miles into the badlands and make sure there are no dragons nesting within that range of the normal places. Maintain an army that can deal with dragons, giants etc, as needed. If you're going high fantasy with elves, dwarfs etc, then each race can have its own way of dealing with things that go bump in the night, but in any given case, your average farmer should never have to deal with anything worse than a stray wolf. The adventurers can go out into the wilds for whatever reason and face the beasts on their own ground on their own lookout, but it shouldn't be for protection of the normal. 

Hippos can't swim, elephants can Two main factors, density and strength of paddling. The fundamental aspect of buoyancy for a creature is overall body density, usually close to water but it varies (most animals are mostly water). It relates to body fat, muscle mass etc. Lung size affects it as well, bigger lungs means you can take a bigger breath and that helps you stay afloat. Swimming is an entirely separate matter to buoyancy. Swimming is about having decent sized paddles available relative to the amount of work they have to do. Should your creature be high density, a natural sinker, it will have to have decent paddles to stay afloat first, then to gain movement relative to the water. Ducks (and other water birds) don't have this problem, they float, but need strong paddles to dive underwater. It's also personal As a species humans have reasonably sized paddles (hands and feet), a trained strong swimmer can hold their own weight and a considerable amount of extra mass. A weak swimmer will struggle to hold their own weight. Roman soldiers were said to have trained to swim a river in full armour. Whether your character drowns is up to the combination of these two factors. 

I'm going to ignore the telepath because on that scale she's largely redundant. Power at a point is good, when you have a target you wish to use it against, but here we're talking about the whole world so: No Simply because the technology at the time would not allow for the logistics required to run an empire on that scale. By the time you've taken your telepath out to Bolivia to crush the rebellion, New Zealand and Scotland have declared independence. While you've solved the communications issue, your telepath knows they've declared independence rather than taking 6 months for you to get the message, you now need to move an army to each location without Madagascar and Greenland deciding to go their own way. What you end up with is really good intelligence on battles too far away for you to do anything about it before the situation goes rapidly downhill. Even if the plan lasts long enough for you to counter it and win the battles, you're not going to be able to gain adequate control over the whole world to be able to declare that you've won the war. 

Spacecraft are generally based on equivalent scale sea going ships Small power boats tend to have a short bow, then the controls, then the rest of the boat, mostly consisting of the engine. Larger boats tend to have either a central (military) or aft (commercial) bridge. If we go back to the days of sailing boats, both small and large boats would have control at the back, why? On small boats the controls are simply a stick on a foil and a piece of rope, on large boats it's a wheel attached to a chain attached to a foil and a lot of shouting. Short chain of command, short chain of control. Let's take a small boat and add power. You now have a choice, you can put the engine at the front and the helm at the back, but there's no reason to do that, better to put the engine right in front of the drive. Now you have a second choice, put the helm on top of the engine or in front of the engine, putting the helm on top raises the centre of mass unnecessarily which will reduce stability, so put him in front. This gives your standard prow, pilot, engine configuration that stuck through to small spacecraft, it's basically a pilot sitting in front of an engine and not much more. With larger ships there's no reason to change the fundamental layout, from a high bridge at the back, the commander can see both what's going on ahead of and around him, the state of his entire ship and cargo, and have an overview of what the crew are doing. Everything that's of interest to him is within a single field of view. To transfer this into starships? Well the military are nothing if not traditionalists and having the bridge away from the leading edge affords a certain amount of protection simply from the presence of the bulk of the ship ahead. While you could experiment with moving the bridge or cockpit around, there's no real need to. It's better to keep the command and control chains short, which makes fault finding easier. The question isn't "Why isn't the bridge at the front" but rather, "Why is the Enterprise bridge high up in the saucer section, not down between the nacelles, behind the main deflector dish, about 10m from engineering?" 

It's a balancing act. There are times when you have to print more money, in fact you should keep printing money, a steady rate of inflation is good for an economy as it stops people keeping large amounts of cash under the mattress. What you need to keep away from is the idea that you can print money to pay your bills, you absolutely cannot do that. What you do is borrow money I'm sure you've noticed that the majority of economies are in debt. Lots of debt, and interestingly they never seem to pay that debt off. That's not strictly true, individual debts are paid off, but the overall debt keeps growing. Don't worry about that, just keep going with your safe steady plan, you print a little money every year to keep steady inflation, You keep investing to maintain some growth. You borrow money at a rate lower than the sum of inflation and growth, ideally you borrow at a rate lower than inflation. What this means is that the debt is devaluing faster than it's increasing, but lending money to you should be the safest thing the lender could possibly do with it. You're always in debt, the debt is apparently growing, but as a proportion of your income debt is shrinking. Always pay your debts. 

Glowing Islands You have constellations. They consist of other islands but some will be brighter than others, they'll form patterns, hence you can navigate. To a certain extent this is "all roads lead to Rome" grade navigation, but it gives you a basis to allow ships to get around. Remember that we've been sailing the seven seas for thousands of years but a method of accurate navigation on open seas was only developed 200 years ago. Skyship captains will be plotting courses between known points, spending as little time free navigating in open skies as possible. They'll be island hopping. The journey from A to Z passes through every point in between. 

The scythe is a tool designed for cutting at nearly ground level. Not ideal if you want to be cutting about 5 foot up. The first thing you're going to do is straighten the blade relative to the handle, maybe even face it entirely in line with the handle rather than at 90deg. At this point you realise you've started with entirely the wrong tool as what you've just created is better known as a billhook (they come with long and short handles) which is basically a polearm with a civilian name. 

The speed of travel on any long journey is always a plot device. If travel is involved, if distance is involved, then the speed of travel and the time taken to travel are key to the plot. If they're not important, if you don't want them to affect the plot in any way, then don't travel. What FTL travel and FTL comms do is allow characters to not be on the ship, or not be excessively long lived and still see the outward and return journey for a vessel within the space of a reasonable career. Restricting your ships to STL travel is still a plot device, just as it would be for taking a sailing ship across an ocean, or taking a road trip, rather than flying. If you want to restrict your ships to STL, that's fine, you just have to consider the implications in a way that FTL travel doesn't. 

Most modern currencies are fiat currencies, this means they have value based on your trust in the government/authority that back it. In this case your backing authority is the Brotherhood. Their willingness to continue accepting the "currency" in exchange for trade goods is what gives the bottlecaps their value. Since they have a reliable value to that one group it gives them value to others as they can always be converted to trade goods with the Brotherhood. However, because there's an effectively uncontrolled supply of bottlecaps they remain a barter item rather than a true currency. Should the Brotherhood stop accepting bottlecaps you could have a financial crisis of sorts. The currency that people have been taking as trade tokens now has "no" value. It becomes up to the other traders to decide between them whether they'll still allow the caps to have value in their own trades. If they do so then they become the new backing authority for the bottlecaps and it's the Brotherhood who may lose out. Just as you would if you stopped accepting the primary currency of the country you live in. Everyone else accepts it, it's all anyone will offer you, it becomes very difficult to do business if you reject it. On the other hand if only the Brotherhood accept bottlecaps and nobody else does, it again becomes very difficult for them to do business. A limited number of people will be willing to go to the effort of collecting this otherwise worthless item for things that could possibly be gained through other, simpler, methods. You could find that the real moneymakers are the re-sellers, the middlemen, who acquire Brotherhood goods and sell them for more commonly accepted currencies, or the money changers who now sit between the Brotherhood and the outside world and take a percentage on almost every deal. If multiple currencies are available in what is otherwise a barter environment, then any of those currencies is ultimately disposable in favour of one of the others. In such a situation it'll be the people who lock themselves to only one currency who lose out. (I've not played fallout so I don't know the specific details for this economy) 

Ideas may be bullet proof but they're not above corruption Ideas like gods are held by a group of people, accept them, welcome them in, consider their ideas and absorb them, but corrupt them. Take their god and make it an aspect of your own. Take their religion and make it a subsect of your own. Their god dies and is replaced by your god, their festivals become variants of your festivals. It's very hard for a minority group to maintain an identity in the face of total and overwhelming acceptance of everything they stand for. If you try to kill or oppress the idea you whittle believers down to a real hard core that hangs on and becomes tougher. If you welcome them with open arms they become soft and their true idea slowly fades into a memory of the old, the hippies, and the borderline bonkers. 

I'm going to keep this short and ignore all issues of counterfeiting. First you have to consider the two types of money 

However it's reasonable to suggest that the skinny ones will already have died before the fatter ones agree that it's time to start eating people. So in practice you'll eat the skinny ones first.
