There Are Historic Examples of Societies Springing Back from Apocalypse As you indicated in the question, human society has bounced back mostly intact from some pretty severe setbacks. 

You could exchange strings for a machine that reads minds and grants requests at its own discretion. Examples are 'Forbidden Planet' and 'The Matrix'. However, if you want to avoid the mechanical or reality is a hoax, you might have the planet be a gestalt intelligence ($URL$ This has been done in fiction before, but I can't recall the title. In this instance, still, to make anything flashy and dramatic would either require reality to be fake (the dreams of the planet) or the world to be connected to some fancy machine that provides delivery through some as-yet-unknown process. As others have pointed out, the really magical seeming things in quantum mechanics may just be an artifact of using probabilistic mathematics, instead of deterministic math, to solve the problems. This hasn't been conclusively proven yet. 

Somewhere in the Kuiper Belt The formula for angular resolution is $ size(radians) = \arctan({diameter \over distance}) $. For something with the diameter of the sun (approximately) of 1.39 million kilometers, angular resolution is 39 arc-seconds at the outer edge of the Kuiper belt (50 AU). At this distance, such an object travelling at what seems to be a fairly median stellar speed of 22 km/s for nearby stars, would arrive at it's closest approach in 10.3 years. Since the object is dark and doesn't create or react to gravity, it might get very close before detection by the public. Especially if it is coming back at an unusual angle relative to the galactic disk. Not all of the sky is being watched at any one time, and mostly we are looking at stars (in the galactic disk). Slow Reaction by Public Even though it's seen, it would be hard for private citizens to prove what is coming. Since the object is dark, a private citizen who glimpsed the object would have to guess the path and velocity in order to make a prediction that he or she could publish to his peers who would certify the claim. Such a citizen would, at first, grossly miss-estimate the path of the object, since a physical object that does not interact with gravity is unknown to us at the moment. This would result in an embarrassing first attempt at proving the path. Such a citizen would also likely, at first, grossly miss-estimate the size of the object since it is not creating gravitational distortion. At the Closest, 1 Light-Minute The closest I think your object would get before it is noticed is about 1 light minute. At that distance, it still only takes a modest 3 degrees of the sky, but that is probably enough to obscure some part of the sky that is being watched. At this distance, the object would be 15 days away from closest approach, if it is travelling at a speed of 15 km/s.

everything is relative. some would say that your average non-magical human can't even make a "living wage" in this non-magic-dependent world. also, physical skills are not the most important skills in a complex society. intelligence, temperament, and communication skills are generally what lead to success, not how well you light a fire (with magic or matches). so, his ability to survive has more to do with the culture of the world he enters, than with the magic there. if he finds a world of ignorance, fear and superstition, then he will probably be summarily executed like any other stranger who teleported into town unannounced. on the other hand, if he finds a world with a complex society and effective communication system, his personality and business acumen should determine his financial success rather than his lack of magic. that said, even if he is a rude idiot, he should be able to feed and cloth himself entirely on the generosity of strangers in a sufficiently wealthy (and/or progressive) society. 

it sounds like living humans are helpless against ghosts, but ghosts can fight each other. as such, ghosts would protect the living souls the way we protect children. similarly, i imagine ghosts would continue to own their property the same way that the elderly continue to own their property. they may not be able to physically stop you from taking it, but other living people will defend ghost's property rights to ensure their own property is not taken upon their death. if it is no more difficult to detect and punish soul theft than it is to detect and punish child abuse, then ghosts would probably be welcomed in polite society as well as any adult man. on the other hand, if detecting soul theft is much harder (e.g. because ghosts can walk thru walls), then ghosts might be banned from human settlements. even still, interaction would probably be peaceful. this answer assumes ghosts have normal human motivations. if you modified your question to suggest ghosts had an overwhelming hunger for souls, then the outcome would be quite different.... 

I would like to make a map for black & white inclusion in a book. I'd like to have lines of latitude and longitude, and be able to drop cities. Could anyone recommend a good map building tool that can be exported to 2D black & white? 

This is the plot of 'Neuromancer'. The security A.I. and the hacker A.I. were... wait, spoilers. The discipline of information security is about reducing the threat surface area. Think about it like actual surface area: limit the number of ways the outside can reach the inside. Information security specialists also perform their own periodic penetration testing, trying to identify weaknesses. It is well-known that people are the most often abused weak point, and penetration testing includes people. Additionally, information security includes imagining that someone does break in and mitigating how much damage can be done by an intruder: this includes encrypting data in transit, encrypting data on the raw disk, encrypting specific files (like layers of armor), multiple accounts with limited (the concept is called 'least privilege' and involves only having access to systems for which you have a demonstrated need-to-know) and non-overlapping privilege, and protecting accounts by only allowing logins from specific locations (like Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs)) or only at specific locations, and not necessarily making every part of the system available from every other part of the system. "Erasing" a hack involves deleting or editing logs or records that recorded the attack. While the attack is ongoing, every activity on all machines is being recorded (as ridiculous as that may seem). These logs are being monitored constantly by algorithms and by people. If an intrusion is detected, the response depends on the attack vector -- if someone is trying to attack the account, disable the account; if someone is taking advantage of a computer, revoke it's trust certificates (essentially detaching the a previously trusted computer from the network); shut down the app; or, if required, shut down the whole system - some security environments include virtual machines (VMs) that are intended to be disposable in the event they appear compromised or infected, only to be rebuilt from a trusted repository - in fact, disposable VMs are one of the security concepts behind apps on cellphones. The hacker, as others stated, is looking to exploit any vulnerabilities. It could physically steal disks and work on decrypting the data. It could also exploit zero-day exploits: gaping flaws in the software environment that no one knows about yet. These may or may not avoid logging, because it's taking advantage of a gap between components.
