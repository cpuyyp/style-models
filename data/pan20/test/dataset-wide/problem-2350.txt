Many printer drivers and other software allow you to "tile" a large document or a magnified one on multiple pages. You can usually specify the overlap between pages, which only needs to be enough for you to cut cleanly. 0.1 inch is usually good enough. Acrobat reader may even have such a option. I know I've done this a few times with my printer, a Lexmark Pro905. That printer is a piece of crap, and I definitely NOT recommend getting one, but the procedure has worked. I don't rememer if the tiling capability was in the printer software or the app. Look around. Once you have the tiles printed on separate piece of paper, you have to trim off the excess paper from one tile for each overlap. Line them up carefully, then put a small piece of tape at each end of the overlap. Continue until all tiles are taped together, even though loosly. Now put a piece of tape over each seam. First do this on top where you can see what you're doing and can be sure the alignment isn't getting messed up. Then flip the whole thing over and tape the seams on the back. At this point you don't have to be that careful anymore because all the alignments have already been fixed by the tape over the seams on the front side. No, the whole thing isn't going to feel like a single piece of paper. You will definitely notice the seams being stiffer when you try to fold it. That's the way it is. If you can't live with that, go to your local office supply place with a print shop and have them print whatever you want on large size paper. 

I'd give them whatever my device or map provided me, and let them convert to whatever their devices or maps use. Anyone used to receiving lat/lon coordinates regularly should be able to convert from various formats to whatever they use internally. You're the one in trouble with limited resources. You're out there with a broken leg, lost, in the cold or dark, or whatever. You're a lot more likely to screw up than someone sitting in a office who is professionally used to dealing with this and probably has equipment that does conversions for him routinely. You are over-thinking this. 

Unless you're stuck in the north of Alberta, you're probably better off trying to get out than surviving in place for a whole winter. That changes your priorities. 

I'm not sure what exactly makes a trail more blind-friendly as apposed to something like wheelchair-friendly, so I'll answer for handicapped-accessible trails in general. The vast majority of trails are always going to be more rugged and not aimed at people with handicaps that prevent them from traveling over rough ground. This is not due to some elitist deliberate exclusion, but due to the realities of cost. Handicapped-accessible trails simply cost much much more to build and maintain than typical "wilderness" trails. However, the trails community is well aware of handicapped needs and tries to address them when practical. This has been a major topic at the last few Massachusetts State Trails Conferences (yes, there are such things). I'm on the Town of Groton Massachusetts Trails Committee, and can recommend two particular trails in town: Nashua River Rail Trail. 

With all these effects together, it would not be surprising to see the output of the panel drop by half in some cases. 

You can see a few miles of the main road into the area, but not a single car on it. This is normal. There are quite a few side roads or old paths that probably see less than one vehicle a month on average. The vegetation is sparse and generally low enough so that you can see over it to get panoramic views. The "slickrock" areas of southern UT are a different experience, with lots of open rock: 

People getting killed by black bears is exceedingly rare. There are roughly 1 per year in North America, and most of those in Canada and Alaska. If you are in your tent at night and hear what you think is a black bear outside, the best thing to do is nothing. I have been in this situation a few times, and in all cases the animal (never saw it so can't confirm black bear) wandered off after a minute or two. They aren't interested in you. If it's a regular campsite, they may have learned that occasionally there are scraps of food to be found. They will sniff around and then leave if they don't find anything. If you have bear spray with you (I didn't on any of these occasions), then get it ready in your hand. That's not because you'll need it to defend yourself, but it will make you feel a little more secure so that you're less likely to do something stupid that will get you into trouble. In the unlikely event that the bear starts poking at your tent, make loud sounds. Yell at it at the top of your lungs. Unless this happens to be the 1 in 1,000,000 encounters where the bear is predatory, it will run off and leave you alone. In the very unlikely event it is a predatory bear, use the bear spray. However, you have to spray at the bear, not inside the tent. This requires you opening the tent, unless of course the bear has already ripped thru it. Seriously though, you are more likely to get hit by lightning than have a black bear break into your tent trying to harm you. Leave the shotgun home. The chances are much greater that you'll have a accident and hurt yourself with it than getting hurt by any bear it might have stopped. I have encountered black bears in the wild while hiking by myself at least three times that I can remember now (probably 4 or more if I thought about it some more). More accurately, those were times when I noticed the bear. Surely there were many more times when a bear noticed me that I wasn't aware of. Each time the bear ran off as soon as it saw me. To give you a better feel for black bears, where is what happened each time: 1 - Northern Yosemite National Park well out of the valley on a trail heading to Hetch Hetchy. I saw a bear about 50 feet in front of me standing sideways across the trail. It saw me about 1/2 second after I saw it. It immediately ran off sideways, and I could hear it running thru the forest for a good distance. The total visual encounter was maybe 1 second. 2 - On top of Mormon Mountain in north-central Arizona, Coconino National Forest. I was standing in the middle of a dirt road and saw a bear cross the road maybe 100 feet in front of me. I stood still and it didn't notice me. It came diagonally closer by going off the road but also partway in my direction. It found a old rotted log 50 feet from me and started clawing at it and was breaking it apart, most likely looking for grubs. I had a camera with me and was going to take its picture, but thought I'd pick up a nice size rock first. I tried to do this when the bear had its back turned, but it caught my movement anyway and ran off so quickly I couldn't get the camera to my eye and focus before it got out of sight into the forest. Again I heard it running some distance into the forest. 3 - On the road down from Mt Greylock in northwestern Massachusetts. It was dusk and I saw a dark blob maybe 200 feet ahead. I thought it might be a bear, but it was too far and too dark to be sure. I kept walking and at maybe 100 feet I could tell it was definitely a bear. As I was deciding what, if anything, I should do about it, the bear saw me and ran up the steep slope at the side of the road. I couldn't see it after it entered the woods, but could hear it running up the slope a ways. Although I tried, I did not see the bear again as I hiked on the road past the spot it had been. 

The values are in US dollars, and were reasonable prices at the time shown. The 4 pieces or rebar where driven into the ground at the corners, then the bridge attached to each of them with a short piece of hanger strap and two nails. This was done because the Conservation Commission insisted that the bridge be "anchored" to keep it from floating away in case the whole area floods (it is within the floodplane of a nearby river). In hindsight, I think the rebar pieces should have been longer. They went into the ground too easily, and I am not sure how much they will really keep the bridge in place in the unlikely event of a large flood and the water moving fast enough to actually push the structure. I am also not so sure how well the hanger straps and the two nails fastening the bridge to each piece of rebar would hold. Here is a closeup showing one corner anchored to the rebar driven into the ground: 

I occasionally have to label smooth plastic surfaces around the office that get handled regularly. As you say, even a sharpie mark wears off after a while. What I do is to write the label with a sharpie, then put a piece of tape over it. Don't use the clear "scotch" tape, but the more permanent milky kind. Make sure it is well stuck down with no air bubbles (rub with fingernail as needed), and it should stay on nicely for a long time even in moist conditions. 

I can't answer for Ontario or that route specifically, but only give you a general idea how private property and trespassing works in the US and Canada. You are right in that we don't have Allemansrecht here, and you have to be aware of that. Legally, in many places you are allowed to walk or ride a bike on a established path as long as there is no phyisical barrier or something like a "No Trespassing" sign. This isn't universally true, and the details can vary by jurisdiction. The only way to know for sure is to ask, but this is a reasonable rule to follow if you don't know anything more specific. If you follow this rule, at worst you may be told to leave. I really don't see anyone getting arrested or fined for trespassing when they got there via a established route with no indication they weren't supposed to be there. A physical barrier could be a fence, or a gate or chain across the road. But context also matters. If you see a dirt road that goes into a farm field and ends at a house, clearly that's a driveway and you shouldn't be there unless you have business with the people in the house. It would be inappropriate to ride your bike up the driveway just to ride the bike when there are reasonable hints it's a private driveway. Signs are more clear and explicit. Not all signs are there to keep everyone out. Read any such sign carefully. The basic "No Trespassing" is clear. Don't go there. Sometimes you see "Private property" or "Private driveway". That generally means don't go there unless you have business with the owner or have previous permission from the owner. Other signs just disallow particular uses, like hunting, motorized vehicles, horses, etc. Hiking and biking are usually the least restricted activities. There are many old roads and paths were it's fine to hike or bike, but motorized dirt bikes and the like are not wanted. Tranveling along a path and camping overnight are two very different things. Generally, unless you know its OK to camp, it's not. Where it's OK varies considerably across North America. In the densly populated east, like here in New England, you're basically not allowed to camp anywhere it doesn't say so or you find explicit permission listed someplace authorotative, like the web site of a National Forest if you are in that National Forest. In practise, stealth camping and being careful to not hurt anything and leaving minimal trace is a viable option in many places, but be aware that you may get fined or arrested if caught. The less you are in anyone's way or affecting the area around you, the less anyone will likely care. Still, that doesn't make it legal, so there is always some risk when you don't have explicit permission. No, you can't assume you are allowed to bike on a back country road just because it appears on Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, etc. When you get there, you may find a gate across the road and/or a "No Trespassing" sign. As for logging roads on land owned by the lumber company, that can vary. Most will probably have a No Trespassing sign at the entrance just to cover their butt legally. If someone gets hurt due to a large pothole, broken bridge, etc, then the logging company has a good legal case by saying that person wasn't allowed to be there in the first place. Some logging companies require you to get a permit, mostly so that they can make you sign a release acknoledging various hazards and absolving them of any responsibility. They may charge a fee for that to cover the cost of having to process the permit. You really need to contact the logging company ahead of time. Chances are they don't really care that you're there, just want to make sure you can't sue them if you get hurt. Also watch out for the logging trucks. They own the road, literally, and often drive that way. They will come barrelling around a corner without consideration of a bicycle possibly being there. When you hear one coming, make sure to be off towards the side of the road and out of their way.
