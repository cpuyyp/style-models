If you twisted/pinched the tube then there will be low spots, where the tire does not seem to inflate fully. If you suspect this, of course, remove and reinstall the tube. If you're convinced the tube is not twisted, slowly inflate the tire while you inspect the junction between tire and rim, all around on both sides. (There is generally a rib on the tire sidewall positioned such that it will be about 1/8" from the rim edge all around when the tire is perfectly centered.) With your hands, "work" the tire one direction or the other to keep this distance equal all around as you slowly inflate. Sometimes tires are hard to get seated properly when new (because, eg, they were hanging on a hook in the shop for months), but quickly "take a set" and are no trouble if you have to dismount/remount the tire later. I'll add that sometimes the problem is that the thickened portion of the tube near the valve has gotten caught between the tire bead and the rim. This will prevent the tire bead from seating on the rim hook properly in the vicinity of the valve. The solution is to completely deflate the tube, then press the valve most of the way in with your finger while you manipulate the tire in the area of the tube. This should cause the "captured" part of the tube to work loose. 

A $500 budget is a little tight, but you can probably find something. If by "road bike", though, you mean a bike with drop bars, you're going to have to scratch a little harder, though. But, one thing to keep in mind is that national outfits like REI will start discounting the list prices on their bikes very shortly (if not already), and the later you wait in the "season" the better deal you're apt to get (though of course selection will diminish somewhat). Local bike shops (in your area) are less apt to do this, but are probably more willing to bargain any time of the year. I do recommend you look at the REI web site since they have a nice selection of decent quality bikes (though mostly over your price range). You'll get a fairly good feel for what you can get for the money there. (But I'm really not pushing REI, it's just an outfit I'm familiar with.) 

I think it's impossible for it to be coming from the bottom bracket while the pedals are not turning. More likely it's coming from the rear hub. I'd first check whether the spoke guard (if you have one) has come loose and is rubbing against the cluster. And inspect the area behind the cluster for any piece of trash that has gotten in there. Failing that, you probably have a problem with your freehub. 

Any wobbly wheel with standard spokes can be "trued", so long as there no broken spokes and the rim itself is not bent. It requires the proper size spoke wrench and a "truing stand". For more precise work you would also want a centering gauge, but that's not necessary in simple cases. The "truing stand" can be a fancy $300 affair, an el-cheapo $50 unit, something you cobble up, or the bike itself. 

If you go to any reasonably well stocked bike shop (or the bike department of a large department store) they will have a fair assortment of bike lights and reflectors. In particular there are a lot of different battery-powered LED flashers available: 

As I've mentioned before, I volunteer with a group called "Pedal it Forward" (under the auspices of the local Kiwanis club) to rehab donated bikes. Most (discounting those that are already scrap when they come in) are given (after rehab) to "Christmas Anonymous" and other charitable causes, but when we get a really nice one we sometimes sell it to help pay for operating expenses. We currently have a really clean, nice looking Cannondale Jekyll 26" full-suspension bike with aluminum frame. The only problem with it is that it's completely missing it's rear derailer and hanger. Apparently the parts were damaged, the owner took them off, and, couple of years later, donated the bike to get it out of his garage. So, where would I find a derailer (and, more importantly, a hanger) to fit this bike? I would guess the bike is about 5 years old. "CAAD4" is printed on the side. It has 2 speeds front, 9 speeds rear. Disk brakes. The front mech is Shimano Deore XT. Serial number: 

Basically there are three styles of bike brakes (aside from disk brakes): Old style calipers, cantilevers, and V-brakes. Calipers are a single unit that mounts on a single bolt above the top of the wheel, cantis and V-brakes are two separate pieces that mount on "bosses" on either side of the wheel. Cantis have short arms and a "yoke" cable between them that the main cable pulls on, while V-brakes have arms that reach above the wheel and a single cable that comes in from one side through a J-shaped metal "noodle". Calipers are the oldest style are are rarely used anymore. Cantilever brakes are still seen on some touring bikes but are becoming rarer. V-brakes are by far the most common style these days. In terms of the brake levers, there is a significant difference, based on the brake design: Caliper and cantilever brakes both have about the same cable "pull" to go from no brake to fully applied, while V-brakes require about twice as much cable "pull". So you must use a brake lever designed for the type of brake installed. Of course, in addition the brake lever must be suitable for the handlebar type, etc. 

You should be able to "sight" this fairly well. Get close to the front sprocket and align your eye such that you're just looking down one side of the front sprocket towards the rear. Moving your head back and forth sideways very slightly the same side of the rear sprocket should flicker into and out of view. Or you can use a long metal ruler, placed against the side of the sprockets. With perfect alignment (which isn't really necessary) the ruler will fit flat against both sprockets simultaneously. 

I seriously doubt that it's due to the lack of shocks, unless you have some really bad roads there -- many people ride bikes great distances with no shocks, skinny, stiff tires, and no real springs in the seat. More likely your problem is with your posture -- seat too low, handlebar too low, handlebar too close or too far away, and/or pedals at the wrong angle to the seat. Presumably you can adjust the seat height, so the first thing to try is to move it a bit higher. When the seat is at the proper height your knees should be nearly straight at the bottom of your stroke. Next, see if you can adjust the seat forward/backwards. Being too far either direction can cause back problems, so try several positions. You probably can't adjust handlebar height, but if you can, try raising it. 

Yeah, first clean the rear derailer well. Simplest way to do this is to lean the bike against a wall (outside, where you can make a mess), slide some newspapers up behind the derailer and drape them down the the wheel (to keep from dripping all over the tire), then spray the derailer well with WD-40, using an old toothbrush to clean it up a bit. Afterwards, wipe the derailer dry, then oil it up well with a heavy oil (preferably bike chain oil). If the bike has more than maybe 2000 miles on it then likely the chain is worn out, and possibly the rear sprockets have developed a "hook". A bike shop can check for this with a special gauge, and replace the chain if it's too badly worn. (If "hook" has developed a new chain will help a bit, but the rear sprockets may need to be replaced.) Regardless, likely the rear derailer is out of adjustment. It's not very complicated to adjust, but it takes a touch of mechanical ability to understand which way to turn things. But mainly it's a matter of adjusting the cable tightness, which is usually done by turning a knob on the cable near the shift lever or elsewhere along the cable route. The other odd possibilities for this problem are that spring has broken in the derailer (or sometimes the spring has just "jumped" off the tang where it's supposed to be hooked), or some jackleg replaced the chain and didn't get the length right. 

I'm gonna sorta disagree with Zen on this one. If you're talking months vs years, and the bike was stored inside in a location where condensation would not have occurred (eg, not in a cold corner of a basement in a humid climate), and the bike was in good condition when stored, then all you need to do is air up the tires and wipe the dust off. The tires and brake pads won't rot overnight, the lube won't leap off the chain. Properly lubed bearings won't corrode. Disk brake rotors (and caliper brake rims) may develop a slight coating of oxidation, but that will be worn off in the first ten miles. If it's been stored for several years, however, you may want to squirt a little oil on the chain and give it an extra wipe, both to get the dust off and because oil does slowly evaporate. And check the tires and brake pads for rot. Once or twice a year a bike should get its cables lubed, and the chain should be cleaned and reoiled every 200 miles or so (or at least once a year). This is unrelated to how long it's been stored, but a good time to do this is when you take the bike out of winter storage (though a better time is before you put it into winter storage). 

If this is a single-speed bike (no shifting mechanism) then the rear hub is probably seized up and needs to be overhauled or replaced. The hubs are designed to be overhauled by ten-year-olds (at least this ten-year-old did so, many decades ago) using ordinary tools, so they're not particularly complicated if you're mechanically inclined (or have a friend who is). However, the hub may be so badly rusted that it needs replacing. If the rear hub is a derailer-type hub with multiple sprockets then likely the "pawls" are broken or stuck as Zenbike suggests. These can sometimes be repaired, but replacement is a better option. Depending on the age of the unit it's either a "freewheel" unit where the pawls are in the sprocket "cluster" or a "freehub" unit where the pawls are in a attachment to the hub itself. If this is something like an old 3-speed hub (with a thin shift chain entering one end of the axle then it could be just a problem with shifter adjustment, but if not then the bike is probably not worth repairing (unless you can find used parts). 

It's (a lot) harder to achieve in-out motion than side-to-side, and generally requires (much) more that 1/2 turn adjustments. Plus you must usually loosen spokes on either side (2-4 spokes away) of a high spot, or tighten spoken on either side of a low spot. For low spots sometimes you need to tighten ALL the spokes except those over the spot. But at some point you need to either scrap the rim or employ a tool to bend the rim. Bending out low spots can be effectively handled with a jury-rigged tool consisting of a couple of blocks of wood with holes drilled in them and a piece of "all thread" with a couple of nuts and washers. (I've never dealt with high spots serious enough to require the opposite tool.) 

In the US $URL$ and $URL$ are two big online bike outfitters. I don't know that either sells bare frames, but they do sell a wide variety of stuff. And of course a number of custom/low volume bike builders sell bare frames. Here is a pretty good list of bike & frame manufacturers. 

If you're talking about the crack running from the opening down into the fillet, that doesn't appear to be likely to seriously affect integrity (though I'm sure there are some here who will disagree). The lug in that area is reenforced by the steering tube, so there's very little stress at that point. (In fact the crack may have been there since manufacture -- it looks like a touch of braze was placed over the crack at some point.) But you do need to be concerned that the crack might propagate over time and turn sideways in the fillet area. That would threaten integrity. So you should check the crack regularly to be sure it's not getting worse. But before integrity is threatened the crack would have to get significantly worse. Even then, failure would be unlikely to be catastrophic -- unless you're totally out of it you'd notice the joint flexing before it went entirely, and a bike can remain rideable (though I don't recommend it) even with the downtube entirely separated. 

Yeah, so long as you're more looking at simple recreation/commuting and not expecting to set any speed/distanced records, you can do a fair job of conversion. First get smoother, higher pressure tires, ideally a bit narrower than your current ones. You do not have to switch to 700C rims, though your choices with 26" rims will be somewhat limited. Next, try to increase your top end gear inches. A larger front sprocket and/or smaller rear cluster. You will almost certainly need to change your chain length for this, and might run into a tooth capacity problem with your rear derailer, depending on how you do it. Lock out or stiffen up your suspension. If there is no lock-out on the bike you can use pieces of plastic drain pipe, cut open on one side, strapped to the cylinders. (Someone may make a commercial product to do this.) The main thing you'll be missing after all this is the geometry of a road bike. For shorter rides this is not so much an issue, but for, eg, touring you'd appreciate the longer wheelbase, more appropriate posture, and more stable steering of a true road bike. Added: One might consider replacing the flat MTB bar with drop bars, but that's complicated (new bar, stem, shifters, brake levers, etc), expensive, and unnecessary for simple recreational/commuting purposes. Many tourists use flat bars, preferring the more upright posture, and you can always add aero extensions if you feel you need them (mostly for the more varied hand positions). 

Yeah, I've tried them all, and keep coming back to the helmet mirror. An eyeglass mount is less stable and doesn't project out from the head as far, so it's hard to see around a bulky helmet (and it seems all helmets these days are bulky). I've tried handlebar mirrors of several varieties, but on my touring bike with drop bars no mirror I've tried is able to see around a set of panniers. Plus you don't get as good a field of view with the handlebar mirror. Keep in mind that the closer the mirror is to your head the wider your field of view (for a given size mirror). And a head-mounted (helmet or glasses) mirror has the advantage that you can rotate your head up/down and left/right to see something not immediately in your field of view. The main down-side of a helmet mirror is its relative fragility. I've most recently (for maybe 5 years) used a Third Eye helmet mirror that attaches to the helmet with an adhesive Velcro pad. It's never gotten knocked off or broken, but it does get knocked out of alignment just about daily. And I have to be fairly careful when I lay my helmet down to not damage the mirror. I'm sure that there are some newer models that are better, but they all have this fundamental problem. 

First and foremost, there is no good reason to ride for extended periods on the "big/big" combination. This produces the worst possible "chain angle" and begs for rubbing and other problems. Second, from the pictures the chain and rear cogs appear to be worn out and in need of replacement. 

A smaller diameter hub is lighter (and likely cheaper). A larger diameter hub has several advantages: 

There was another thread on pretty much the same subject about 2 weeks back, but I didn't find it after a weak attempt at a search. As zenbike indicates you need to match the # of speeds and the "cage length", though simply picking a derailer that claims to be, say, "long cage" isn't a reliable technique for sizing cage length. Rather, you need to check the tooth "capacity", which is the difference in # of teeth between the largest two cogs (front and rear) and the smallest two. This specifies (indirectly) the amount of chain that the derailer must "absorb" when going from the "tightest" cog combo to the "loosest". (Also check the specs for the largest and smallest rear cogs that the derailer is good for.) With a true mountain bike, one that's used off-road and in weeds and brush, you want to avoid an overly long derailer that will hang down too close to the ground and thus be more subject to damage or picking up weeks -- pick the one that fits. (Unfortunately the old Suntour triple design is no longer made -- it packed a large tooth capacity into a short arm.)
