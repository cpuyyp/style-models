I have a 2005 Trek Pilot 2.1 which has both carbon forks as well as carbon seat stays on a mostly aluminum body. The reason that carbon is used in those two places is because aluminum is incredible stiff and in those early alu bikes, they didn't know how to soften the ride. 

I think electric turn signals on bicycle are a silly idea. As a motorcycle rider, I know that cars ignore turn signals. Motorbikes and bicycles are invisible to cars. On my bicycle, I do my hand signals (especially the left turns in the USA where I'm crossing against traffic) in conjunction with looking back and making eye-contact with whatever homicidal cager is threatening to run me down. I also signal lane shifts the same way. Hand signals are a visible claiming of space and the head turn / eye-contact is a critical part of this. (On my motorbike, I tend do lane changes with hand signals. Pointing to the space that I'll occupy along with a death glare at the car behind me is much more effective than a little blinker). 

The main problem with clear-coat is that it takes away all of your future options. You can't paint over the clear coat so you won't be able to paint the bike again without taking off the clear coat, which means taking off all of the paint, taking the bike back down to bare metal and repainting. If you're still vacillating and/or saving up money about what to do, I would do minor touchups using touch-up paint (available at an auto hardware shop) and instead cover the major parts of the frame with helicopter tape (also called Racer's tape). It's relatively cheap, durable, and most importantly -- easily removable. 

What would happen if the child's front wheel wasn't locked to the trailer attachment? Again centrifugal force would make the trailer act like a giant whip, jackknifing, and throwing the child off. Note the magnitude of the centrifugal forces acting on the rear bicycle would be greater than even the strongest of superlemur children and they would not be able to hold the handlebars straight to force the rear into alignment. 

I noticed that caliper brake pads (holders) have little wings on the bottom that aren't present on v-brake pads. What is the purpose of these little wings? 

Front brakes take the brunt of braking forces - so the front rotor wears faster than the rear. With mechanical disc brakes, the rotor gets pushed in one direction only so wear is also uneven. For extreme cheapskates, would rotating your rotors front to back make any sense (assuming same size discs)? Would flipping them make any sense (or even be feasible)? 

It's pretty easy to identify a link that you've already pushed out -- it'll be dead easy to push out again, with little to no resistance. By that time, it's already too late and I'd just replace it with a quick link. I'm not sure your resistance to quick links. They're cheap, strong, and easily identified. You don't have to use a quick link as a quick link, you can just avoid the quick link and push out the pins on another section of chain if that's what spins your wheels. 

Indexed and Electronic Shifting Shimano introduced Shimano Indexed Shifting (SIS) in 1984. If a bicycle has indexed shifters, then it is model year 1985 or later -- assuming that the shifters and derailleurs haven't been replaced. The first Shimano Di2 electronic shifters were introduced on a production bicycle by Giant in 2009. 

First of all, you shouldn't use WD-40. It's OK for its primary purpose of driving water out of thing (Water Displacing Formula #40) - but it leaves a thin sheen of light oil. This is ok for door hinges, but when used on locks, it attracts dirt and grit, which can actually make the lock worse. (The internal mechanism of most quality locks is brass, which shouldn't "rust" -- what you're most probably feeling as "rust" is the dirt and grit that's gotten into the mechanism. Even if the body were made of titanium, you'd still likely make the locking mechanism out of brass because of its ability to be precisely machined and its self-lubricating properties). Use a dry lubricant for the internal mechanisms of locks. Locksmiths prefer graphite, which you can get at your hardware store. Or you can use PTFE based dry chain lubricant if you have it - but do make sure it doesn't leave a greasy film, some do. 

If you don't have a compressor, you can use a CO2 cartridge (or two or three) inflator to quickly give that burst of air/CO2 that you need to seat the tubeless. It's very difficult with a floor pump. [] Source: Wikimedia commons 

Most likely a gasket/o-ring blew or some debris is caught up in the internals. I wouldn't use WD-40 as the light kerosene can deteriorate o-rings or some plastics. I'd try with some canned air / compressed air. If your pump head is well designed, you can take it apart and rub some silicone lube on the o-rings and mating surfaces to help restore the seal. If you don't have silicone lube, look for a grease that is o-ring/plastic friendly (WD-40 and vaseline are NOT o-ring friendly). In the image below (of a portable not stand pump) the o-rings and gaskets/plunger are the two circled objects in the very middle. 

The batteries don't like the cold. Many battery chemistries don't like the cold -- notably alkaline, manganese (heavy-duty), and NiMH/NiCad batteries. To test this hypothesis, put your light (or even just the batteries) in your freezer. If your light gets weaker the colder it gets, this is your problem (especially with cheap lights that don't have step-up converters). You can pre-warm your batteries or switch to a chemistry that is more cold-resistant - such as Lithium. Lithium is stronger in cold weather, but not invincible so again you may want to pre-warm your batteries. Unfortunately, lithium AAA 1.5v replacements are quite expensive and not rechargeable. You might be best getting a new 18650 lithium battery rechargeable light. If the lights turn off in the cold even with fresh batteries, then you may have a faulty solder joint. As the light gets colder, the components in it shrink at different rates and it's easy for an electrical connection to break due to bad soldering. This might only happen when the light is below a certain temperature. If the light flickers or turns off at a certain temperature (rather than dimming), then you most probably have a poor connection. While you could resolder or reflow the solder, it may be just easier to get another light. 

You should note that non-key-retaining locks that don't involve a separate lock-actuating lever are susceptible to shimming. Before buying a lock, you should always google or YouTube search to see if your lock can be easily shimmed or bypassed. Ps I would not worry too much about picking unless it's a tubular lock, as most thieves will prefer to use physical force (cutters, grinder) as they are much faster (5-30 seconds) than picking (1-5 minutes in ideal circumstances; 3-20 in non-ideal). 

There are two types of brake anchor (one is plum-shaped, the other is barrel-shaped or cylindrical). If you have the wrong one at the brake end, it won't fit properly and will slide around. To solve this, some brake cable vendors sell their cables with both types of end anchors attached. You just use the end that you need and cut off (with a proper brake line cutter, not a pair of pliers) the end you don't need: 

Aside from (n+1), the other honest answer is: as many as your spouse will tolerate, often written as (s-1). At the time I wrote this answer, I had six bikes (two road bikes, one mtb, two folders, one English cruiser). I had met the spousal tolerance factor. After this, I can only replace, not add. So if I really wanted that Brompton, one of the folders had to go. You can click my profile to see what I currently have. Now, your question doesn't also get to another important question: 

I'd also recommend a cargo bike but instead of the "Dutch" style that krzyski mentions, there's also the "stretch" style. This particular model has an electric hub motor for additional oomph. The step-through design also makes it easier for you to not kick your child in the head when you get on the bike. If you're getting any model of child-carrier where the child is in the rear, get a step through design especially if you want your kid to go to college and/or not need years of therapy. These stretch designs tend to be a little cheaper than the Dutch designs as they don't require a complicated front steering mechanism. They are also lighter and may even fit on some bus racks (depending on how much they were stretched). They still cost the same as a low-mid road bike, though. 

Keep the wheel on the bike and use a hacksaw to gently cut through the exposed bolt. If you don't want to scratch your QR nut, you can protect it with some electrical tape. After you cut the bolt off unscrew the QR nut, this will clean the threads. Use a file to clean up the end of the bolt as it will have sharp jaggies. 

Many of us pull bike trailers - whether one-wheeled or two-wheeled -- cargo or kids. What is the best way to lock up trailers - especially when you're commuting? Most trailers come with a quick-release attachment to the bike, which means they're also easy to steal. 

If that doesn't dissuade you, then you should know that Shimano doesn't generally sell replacement parts**. About the only thing that Shimano lets you do is change the oil and the bearings. If the hub is still under warranty, then Shimano will replace it in its entirety rather than trying to fix it. If it's broke out of warranty, then Shimano says: "Sorry, you should have bought a Rohloff." ** Your mileage may vary. As krzski notes, some Shimano dealers in some countries may have spare parts. Rohloff does have replacement parts but Rohloffs rarely break. Here's one person's take-apart of a Rohloff hub: 

Is there a power outlet located within extension cord range? Is it close enough that you could get a motor vehicle nearby and use an AC inverter to power a regular grinder? Have you seen if your local police force or city/university grounds crew can remove the lock for you? They often have to tools for when they need to impound illegally parked bikes. Tool rental shop Locksmith (note that they might charge through the nose for a site visit) 

They make it impossible to lock both the frame and a wheel with U-locks. Fat wheels don't fit. If they do fit, if someone or something (like a strong wind) pushes on your bike, it'll easily taco your wheel. 

However, beyond this pithy answer, the actual complexities of installation are up to you and the particular motor/kit you choose. We're not a shopping site so asking "What's the best hub motor for a trike" would be ruled off-topic. You should instead ask "What characteristics of a hub motor would I look for if trying to install one in my trike" or "Which wheel should I put the hub motor in on my trike?" or "Should I use a throttle or pedelec for my trike electrification." Finally, remember you can also always ask specific followup questions ("how would I install a Bafang BBS-HD given my recumbent's raised crank") once you've made the decision.
