If one aims at perfect representation, that doesn't include the "entering into" at all. Representational thinking is a form of "gnosis". So the question makes no sense. 

The simplest is the question whether one really sees a house, or say a library or human being. So, do you actually see a house, or do you only see shapes and colors? The claim is that one sees something more than the so-called sense data. Or, that one can not even know the place where the sense-data is to be separated from the object as the subject matter of a causal science. So that instead of saying that there is what one sees as a subjective matter, a house, and what one sees as a causal matter, psychical stuff, one posits being as such. One can by further referred to Brentano's work: On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle. One of the works that was essential to Heidegger’s early research into the question of being as such. 

Senators in the U.S. use the phrase ad hominem, meaning, directed at the person, as a high way of saying, that's insulting. Insulting and therefor not productive to friendly deliberation. It's not ad hominem in the proper sense, of being aimed at your principles or view of the matter. Since it is a distortion of your view, rather than a speaking to your view. There's a mistaken view that ad hominem is always something negative, it's not. If they really address your views, that's legitimate and even helpful to a deliberation that aims at clarifying issues. The modern usage is vexed by the fact that the understanding of what a fallacy is is largely withered. So far as ad hominem is a rule of good sense, of experienced judgement, i.e., an informal fallacy, then the issue is if they dismiss the matter for the reason of the source alone. That doesn't make sense, since even a fool can say something that is true. If only from time to time. But views don't exist apart from human beings. So one must speak to the one who has the conviction or opinion, in order to change the opinion. It's clear, in the cases you bring, that no friendly attempt to change your view is meant. Rather an attempt at Character Assassination is meant, or at thuggish dismissal. 

It depends how one understands the phrase "ad hominem". It is often simply used to mean an insult or abuse. I would say your statement likely is abusive, it sounds so. But that is to impute it with a certain intent. Common sense would hold it to be ad hominem, this is the usage now current on the Senate Floor of the U.S.. If it means an informal logical fallacy, concerning ruling out an argument, a priori, because of its source, that's wrong because you are stupid, ergo, all you say is wrong, then I would say this does not fit. Because as a matter of logic we can't bring in common sense, thus we must believe that the premise "you have not come up with a single logically coherent argument or counter-argument" is a fact. And not what it likely is, an insult or mere depreciation. In the tradtion ad hominem was largely a phrase used to oppose eristic argumentation. Standing back and saying things without exposing oneself to persuasion. In the current usage, "adversarial" is what is opposed to ad hominem in the sense of the tradition. In Plato's Republic for instance, Socrates uses ad hominem argumentation to show Polemarchus that he did not truly have the opinion about Justice he believed himself to have. This was possible because he entered the argument in a friendly fashion, exposing his being to transformation. Of course, a defense attorney would be wrong to do that, since he would thereby abandon his duty to zealously defend his client, it is for the judge to enter the argument in that situation. 

The ordinary meaning is that science works in terms of effects. Whereas all human and animal thinking happens in terms of means to an end. One keeps seeing what some effect can cause, storing up all the possible things that can happen as though putting things on the shelf of a storeroom. So long as we see it in this ordinary way, "ordinary" is a cipher for a kind of captivation by the current average outlook of man as man. We have enough of the explanation as soon as we hear it. Effects? OK, understood, now let's go read the latest ideas of the Speculative Realists--much-more interesting by far! Therefore, in the work called Heidegger, one can not stay with the plain description which, this work says, is deadly to philosophizing. 

Yea. He's excluding the moral self or "constitution" from science. From the clear and distinct. Fitting it to Newtonian physics, i.e., to the non-metaphysical physics, as Kant understood it. 

In simple terms, that would only violate Relativity. By going outside the so-called Light Cone. What I mean is, one could as easily regard it as a failure of the way of mathematically representing so-called space-time. In other words, "time" is here understood relative to a thought experiment which has been formalized and is in many cases functional, i.e., it does stuff/predicts things. addendum explanatory: The notion of "curved space", e.g., is not sufficient for philosophy, diological discussion. Since it implies a "rectilinear" space, as a limit state, out of which the so-called curve is defined. It simply hangs like an axiom in mid air, and asks, do I give results? It doesn't connect to the ground of human sense. So, it is rather like a complex game, and not like a true place from which one can say, here is time as such. 

"Objective statements are perceived as true. Neutral statements, however, do not contain a clear position and are viewed as uncontested." I would try entries on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy website for specific references. 

Addendum as luminosity: The term natural is much more obscure than it looks. It could mean a wilderness with primordial trees and permafrost, or a park with a fine green lawn. That doesn't seem like what is meant, otherwise the city with its built things, would be super-nature itself. When people who are into the sciences speak of the "natural world", they seem to mean anything that is not "religious". That someone would hear a bird cacaw and take it to be the devil, is an example given of the "supernatural" by such people. Thus, the "natural" is whatever doesn't turn out to be a mistake. The comment by "MarkOxford" points towards the Catholic understanding. For example, that anything that is possible, that there could be a well-good written sentence here, but, instead, we get one that is a run-on sentence,points us to "super-nature", i.e., the store of possible things beyond what actually is. Which, one might say, only exists as the imagination of being as such, the possibility back behind all actually being things. For the most part the modern discussion turns between asking about "mistakes" taken to be otherworldly, or the question about whether there must be something metaphysically, as it were, which allows for manifestation of things as such, i.e., God as potentia, and as the actus purus, what always is even when no thing is, as what lets all things be. In a certain sense, for physics, time is super-natural. Time is just a name for massive bodies. An illusion. One only has mass and energy when stringently thought. Space, and the movement of massive bodies, which is space, allows for nothing else in surplus of this. 

It is confusing because most people who say that don't know what it means in the technical philosophic sense. They usually just mean that they are into science. In the strict sense it is a claim about the nature of a secret inner core of a thing, the substance, which is not the thing we see, the mere appearance. When Penrose says math really exists, he makes a claim about the nature of homogeneous Philosophic Material. Dennett speaks of “one stuff”, i.e., one hidden substance which consciousness represents through the appearance. In his sense it amounts to the same thing as saying consciousness is a an illusion, or, almost an illusion. Reducible to the one stuff. In the Heideggerian sense it means there is something that is there, e.g., a chair, and we understand it as something, a chair. The claim is that a thing and the way it is understood both lay in a shared being. Da(there)-sein(meaning). The “-” dash is being. Kant says, contravening Heidegger, when I have something which is something, I add no more by saying, it is. Is is the “cupola” of a sentence. People like Russell exclude the sentence, and hold that it has no proper existence. 

It's a long question about what "objective" means here. But supposing it means simply, interdependent existence. Kant, in the sense of this something that has an existence independent of man, gives such an understanding. This requires a serious explanation! The understanding of Kant's Third Critique, so-called, view of aesthetics, of so-called taste, now everywhere dominating the universities, is the result of Schopenhauer', his rival, grossly-false reading. Which was afterwards made popular through Nietzsche and then disseminated to all quarters of the thinking world. One can easily demonstrate this to oneself by making an examination of the word "indifferent". Which is a scholastic term, meaning, as Heidegger translates it, freie Bewahrenden, free preserving. Indifference was a word indicating the way the universal did not favour one particular over another. When one rereads Kant's notions of the Sublime, now informed, before in the dark, the clear light of this argument comes to speak to one.
