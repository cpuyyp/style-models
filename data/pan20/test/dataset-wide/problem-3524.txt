Muscle soreness (and the time after workout it takes to feel the soreness) is referenced by the term DOMS, which stands for Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. You are asking about any relationship between the time in feeling the soreness, which from my knowledge/experience doesn't say much in regards to your personal health. Only the intensity of the soreness will usually correlate to how well you worked out that muscle. However having a delay of 12 hours in one muscle group and 24 in another does not say much regarding the training or status of those muscles. In my case, I feel muscle soreness in my chest the day after I trained it, but will always feel soreness in my legs two days after. However, this information doesn't relate to the strength of those body parts or the intensity of the training. 

The weight in which you are lifting does not perfectly correlate to the numbers on the stack. The weighted plates that you put the pin into are showing the weight of the stack up to where the pin is. If you see the stack increasing in 10 lb increments that means that each plate is 10 pounds. Due to the mechanics of the machine, you are not necessarily doing 10 more pounds of work. The best example of weights that actually show how much weight you're lifting would be with free weights. 

There are a few reasons you might not be seeing muscle gains and only fat gains. I'll start out with the first one that comes to mind, and the most probable from my perspective. You are. Take pictures, lots of them. If you're in a surplus and gaining muscle you are naturally going to gain fat too. This is going to look like you've gained mostly fat when in actuality you've gained fat and muscle. If you've got pictures you can compare yourself within them. When you lose the excess fat after your bulk, you'll regain muscle definition and you can see any gains made much easier. I'm also curious about how you're training. 5-6 times per week? Light weights? 1RM's? High Reps? Low Reps? How long are your sessions? Are you doing cardio? What type of training are you doing? These are all important factors in how you're training. If you're eating in a surplus and hitting your protein levels you will notice muscle gains providing you are working out adequately. Your body will develop more muscle if you are: A.) Giving your body a reason to build more (working out so your body adapts) B.) Giving your body the proper tools to build muscle (Protein, proper rest, etc.) 

If you're trying to bulk up, then make sure you're eating a surplus amount of calories every day and that you're working out. Twice a day is not necessary, and might even lead to more harm than good. Protein powder is another supplement which might be beneficial if your diet is lacking protein. I imagine if you're eating in a surplus that you likely wouldn't need to take any additional protein supplements. Keep lifting heavy weights to promote muscle growth and eating enough so that your body has the materials needed to actually build the muscle. You'll gain muscle mass in time. 

Your conclusion is more or less right, if we are taking very short distances. Very short. Like ... kicking. And even in that case there are different factors to consider. There are different kind of muscle cell (look up fast twitch for example); Your tendons store energy from the impact on the ground and release it for the next step, so how good that works has an effect as well. These are just two examples. If you just want to run fast, congratulation, you are probably done. I'm sure you can run 100m in below 7.5min/mile. If you want to run longer, you'll have to train endurance. But you don't want that, so there is nothing to add to this answer... 

I'm wondering how one should control the speed of running. Currently my running speed for a 'long' run goes like this: 1st-3rd minute: Starting an 9km/h going down to about 8km/h. I actually try to run slower, but find it difficult and awkward. -40th minute: From a little over 8km/h slowly decreasing to 7km/h. -45th minute: Slightly increased speed (7.5 to almost 8km/h) due to 'end of run motivation' Heart rate is at about 140bpm after 5minutes and increases slowly to about 150bpm after 40minutes, going to 155-160 in the last 5 minutes. Question: Should I change anything on the speed profile in order to be able to run for longer time at about the same average speed or a little faster. This is not about the training effect of the pace/intensity, but about the ability to maintain the average speed for longer / increase the average speed for a given distance. Basically as if the run would be a competition. Especially: 

Have vegatables and fruits nearby in an easy to munch way: carrot sticks, apples, cut bell pepper. So you can eat this kind of stuff when you feel a little hungry. It is relatively low in calories and needs time to digest, making it easier to stay away from calorie bombs. This kind of food also has a lot of other stuff in it that your body needs. Eat slowly. The brain needs some time to realize it has enough food in the belly. If you are eating fast, you will eat a lot although you are already full, but haven't realized it yet. A recommendation I hear often is to chew every bite at least 20 times. Stay away processed sugars. They cause a steep incline in blood sugar level, followed by a surge of insuline, followed by a steep drop in blood sugar level, causing hunger ... Prefer stuff like muesli, whole grain bread. 

TL;DR Don't start with 4K right away; Don't run in your work clothes. I started running about a year ago and jog part of my commute on some days, so I guess my experience might be helpful. 

The speeds provided by @radpin seem to be slow for short distances. A pedestrian without training and on even ground should be able to walk 4-6km per hour for at least an hour. Compare $URL$ But for short distances one would sprint if the ground allows. World record for 100m is a little below 10 seconds (36km/h). So an average persons should be able to do this in 20-30seconds. 50 ft are about a sixths of that distance so 3-6seconds (12-18km/h). Now the last factor is the ground. Speeds mentioned above are on even ground. If the ground is uneven enough (e.g. a pile of lumber or deep snow) speed can be reduced as low as you want, and also depends on the risk you are willing to take. On somewhat usable ground (trail in the woods, loose sand on the beach) I'd expect about half the speed on normal ground, so about 6-12 seconds for 50ft or 6-9km/h. Which the first roleplaying page I found for the topic agrees with (look for the Table: Hampered Movement) Be careful with the absolute speeds in role playing games. They often assume a combat situations, where you don't run as fast as you can, but also try to stay alife and/or kill other people. Goals not so common in real life for most of us.
