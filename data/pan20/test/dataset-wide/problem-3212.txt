While it was capable of sending Morse code, operators obviously preferred voice. If you thought encrypting Morse code with a typewriter was bulky, slow and impractical, if you wanted to do voice communications you used this. 

Anti-tank development is littered with attempts, formal and improvised, at giving your average soldier the ability to blow up a tank at suicidally short range. I'd recommend Ian Hogg's book with the no nonsense title Tank Killing. Unfortunately my copy seems to have taken a walk, so I'll have to do this from memory. I'm going to skip what the other answers have covered. The most effective and ubiquitous weapon that fits your description is the Panzerfaust 30. Appearing in 1943 with an effective range of just 30 meters, it fired a highly effective shaped charge lobbed along at a pokey 30m/s. The weapon was discarded after a single shot. It was issued to all sorts of troops in great quantity. It was only in late 1944 that Panzerfausts with a range of 100m reached the troops. The US Army, desperately playing catch up with European armies, got the idea maybe a soldier could shove various pieces of their kit into a tank's wheels and make it throw a track. In Nov 1939 US tanks were scarce, so they brought out a T5E4 combat car as a stand in and shoved rifle stocks, machine gun barrels, and rocks into the tracks. First they figured out this was basically impossible to do on a moving tank, so they slowed it to a crawl. Once they finally got the things jammed in there they discovered that a tank is very good at destroying rifle stocks, machine gun barrels, and rocks. Source: The Chieftain's Hatch: Rifles vs Tanks. The Molotov cocktail was mentioned in the question, and I believe this qualifies. While they could be used by dedicated tank hunter teams, their fragility and extremely short range did not make them good weapons in this role. In order to be effective, the burning cocktail had to strike the engine cover at the rear of the tank. This was best done after the tank had driven past you, or from a second story window, or the firing slit of a bunker. They could be improvised, but many were manufactured. The Finns, during the Winter War with Russia, lacking anti-tank weaponry, made half a million of them. Rather than a rag in a bottle of gas, it was gasoline or other fuel to make it burn, plus rubber or tar to make it sticky. Rather than using a rag, they used a bundle of wind-proof matches or a glass vial of exothermic chemicals. The preferred improvised weapon was a bundle of hand grenades, the Germans called them Geballte Ladung. An individual hand grenade wouldn't do much to a tank, but a bundle of six warheads tied to a single stick grenade could. Not a lot of damage, but it would do something. It could be safely carried, created out of materials at hand, and with the handle it could be thrown up to 30 meters. 

Madison goes on to explain that the King could not make you a citizen. You were a citizen either by birth or by act of Parliament, and that this implied allegiance to the nation first. 

Similarly, the pressures of the Battle of the Atlantic drove the British to invent and develop the first computers to speed the breaking of German encryption. First the Bombes and then Colossus the first programmable digital computer. 

The Great War has a short segment on "the spikey helmets". The original Pickelhaube was made out of hardened leather. As WWI progressed and Germany experienced shortages, thin steel, tin, felt, even paper was used. As you can imagine, this wasn't much use as a helmet in a modern war. They were expensive, fragile, uncomfortable, and didn't offer much protection against bullets and shrapnel. The cover had the regiment's number on it for identification. It was gradually replaced with the cheaper and far more practical steel Stahlelm in 1916. Did it have any combat value? Prior to WWI shrapnel and head wounds were less of a problem, and hardened leather could turn away a saber blow. WWI brought lavish use of machine guns, snipers, and artillery and suddenly a fancy leather hat was next to useless. The metal spike was purely for show. It was probably copied from Russian helmets and originally had a horsehair plume. 

Unfortunately, once control was returned to the states much of this reform was quickly eroded and within a few decades replaced with segregation and disenfranchisement now known as the Nadir of US Race Relations. 

We're allowed to own gold today because we no longer use the Gold Standard or any material thing to back our money, known as representative money. Today's money is backed by our faith in the government to repay its debts, our faith they won't print too much money, and the value the markets say it has: fiat money. Governments have control over their fiscal policy, and private gold speculators have only a very mild effect. For a general overview of all this, I highly recommend Extra History's series on The History Of Paper Money. 

German jets and solid rocketry were fueled by a desperate need to stop the around the clock Allied bombing campaign. Germany need a cheap, high performance interceptor that could reach the high flying and heavily armed Allied bombers. Range was not important, they were flying over Germany, so fuel hungry jet engines could be used. Many, many designs were tried. Only two were successful: the Me 262 and (to a much lesser extent) the He 162, but they came too late to change the war. In contrast, the Allies needed long range fighters to protect their bombers; fuel hungry jet engines would not make it to Germany and back. Instead, they opted to stick with conventional, fuel efficient propeller driven aircraft. By the time the Me 262 appeared in 1944, there were so few of them with so little fuel and so few experienced pilots, slower Allied fighters overwhelmed them. The Allies quickly realized the jets had short legs and learned to follow them back to their bases and shoot them down as they landed. But the Germans were only about a year ahead in jets. Most Allied nations were developing jets during the war and were operational shortly after. The Gloster Meteor was operational in 1944 and the P-80 Shooting Star was prototypes. With a range of just 600 miles, compared to the P-51 Mustang's 1500, the Meteor was relegated to defending the UK. 

This book is from 1911, a possible source of inspiration. TASER stands for Thomas A Swift's Electric Rifle. 

Just last year, Dame Stella Rimington, former Director General of MI5, asserted that Cavell was also a British spy. She, or at least her network, was passing along intelligence about German positions to the British. 

Alternatively: why and when did others switch away from MM/DD/YY, if they ever used it? I always write out the month name to avoid ambiguity. Update: Since it came up in the comments, I'm asking about humans, not computers. Note: There's already a question which includes this, but the answers focused on the metric system. The normal reason for the US hanging onto the Imperial measurement system, an install base untouched by WWII, don't seem to apply to a date format. 

Two declassified Warsaw Pact documents give insight into their plans. The Warsaw Pact "Plan of Actions of the Czechoslovak People’s Army for War Period" from 1964 which outlined the plan for Czechoslovakia in the event of a NATO attack and Seven Days To The Rhine which is a response to a NATO nuclear first strike to cut off Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union. The plans make several things clear: The Warsaw Pact expected NATO to strike first with a tactical nuclear strike, and they saw a limited nuclear war as feasible. This is the opposite of NATO's own planning which assumed the Warsaw Pact would strike first, planned to avoid nuclear weapons if possible, and planned to respond to nuclear weapons with a disproportionate response. 

Source Hitler himself detested smoking, but I can't find solid information about smoking at the Führerbau. I've found a great many contemporary photographs of people at the Führerbau, but none features an ash tray or someone smoking. As this was a large office building, I can only assume smoking was allowed else everyone working there would be made miserable. There is a historically accurate deception story in the Munich Agreement negotiations. 

It's not a capital ship under my definition, but I'm including it anyway because it's my question. :P It also mentions a book I'll look into "Torpedo: The Complete History of the World's Most Revolutionary Weapon" whose title is a bit of forgivable hyperbole. 

tl;dr: Common Law, inherited from Britain, says you're a citizen by right of birth or parentage... but a citizen of what? The principles of the US revolution imply your first obligation is to your society (ie. the people of your state). When your state changes its allegiance, so do you. An analogy can be drawn to if your state rewrites its constitution: the rules change, but you're still a citizen of that state. 

For an appreciation of the troubles of a WWII submarine, I recommend the famous fictional but quite accurate German submarine movie Das Boot. They even have to transit the Strait. I would also highly recommend the historical book One Of Our Submarines, the account of British WWII submarine captain Edward Young. This is an accurate, detailed, and very well written biographical account of submarine life and tactics. He also has to deal with straits, and without the luxury of deep water. Avoid the dreadful and wildly inaccurate movie U-571. 

Just when the US carriers were spotted, the Japanese were busy recovering the first raid on Midway and preparing for the second. This was Midway's critical contribution. Midway was far better defended than the Japanese anticipated (which should have tipped them off that something was wrong), and they had been attacked (ineffectively) by land-based Midway bombers. This convinced the Japanese that a second strike was necessary. Just as they were about to recover the first strike force and preparing the reserves for a second strike, the American carriers were spotted. While the Americans decided to strike with whatever was on hand, the Japanese did not. It was decided to take the time to recover the Midway strike force, rearm for anti-ship work, and launch a full strike. This had two consequences. Had the Japanese attacked immediately, their full strike force would have been on the way to the US carriers even as three of their four carriers were being sunk. This may have resulted in heavier losses for the US and the probable loss of the Midway Islands (the Japanese had a fleet of battleships in reserve). Even so, a tactical stalemate would have still been a strategic victory for the US: the US could replace air crews and carriers, the Japanese could not. The other consequence was at the moment the US dive bombers attacked, the Japanese carriers were busy fueling and arming aircraft. The effect of the relatively few US bomb hits (Akagi was only hit by one) were greatly magnified by hangers and decks full of ammunition and fuel. Fires raged out of control and secondary explosions did considerably more damage than the bombs themselves. Lax Japanese damage control also helped the situation along. Again, the timing was down to luck. Had the US attack arrived an hour earlier or later, Midway would have provided no advantage. Had the scout plane which spotted the carriers taken off on time the Japanese would have been prepared and Midway would have provided no advantage. Had the Japanese not been so overconfident and so sure of their deception plan, Midway's heavy defenses should have tipped them off that something was wrong with their plan. With a more alert Japanese commander, Midway might have been a detriment. 

Japan did not conquer Vietnam, it had already been conquered by the French. For most of the war Japan left the existing French colonial government in place and negotiated the rights to station troops there and move them through the country. Initially, Japan was only interested in Northern Indochina to cut off supplies to China. To this end they signed an accord with Vichy France in Sept 1940 to be able to station and move a limited number of troops through French Indochina (modern Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam). The Japanese immediately violated this but eventually things settled down. Japan did not advance further south for fear of antagonizing the US and Britain. In October 1940 Thailand took the opportunity of France's weakness to win back territory lost in the Franco-Siamese War of 1893. After defeats for the French, the Japanese stepped in to mediate a cease-fire in January 1941. France ceded disputed border provinces to Thailand. Realizing they could no longer defend their overseas territories, and not being at war with Japan, in July 1941 Vichy France signed the "Protocol Concerning Joint Defense and Joint Military Cooperation". This secured Indochina for the Vichy French and gave the Japanese airfields and bases close to attack South East Asia. This state of affairs of mostly peaceful cooperation between the French colonial government and Japanese military continued until almost the end of the war. In March 1945, with France restored and the war turning against them, the Japanese launched a coup d'état in Indochina. They redeployed their troops to surround the French garrisons and suddenly ordered them to disarm. Fighting was brief, and in a single day the Japanese dismantled French rule in Indochina. The Japanese split Indochina into three puppet states under sympathetic rulers: the Empire of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Kampuchea (Cambodia), and the Kingdom of Laos and made them all part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. By handing Vietnam independence from French colonial rule, and eventually allowing reunification of north and south Vietnam, Japan avoided a fight with the native populations. Once the Empire of Japan fell, the short lived Empire of Vietnam did as well and the Viet-Minh took over in the August Revolution.
