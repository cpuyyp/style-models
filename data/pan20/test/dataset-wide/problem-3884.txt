Disclaimer: I know almost nothing about Schubert varieties and K-L polynomals. The general relationship between $\mathbf F_q$-points and cohomology is the Grothendieck-Lefshetz trace formula $$ \# X(\mathbf F_q) = \sum (-1)^i \mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Frob}_q | H^i_c(X \otimes \mathbf{\overline F}_q,\mathbf Q_\ell)).$$ If $X$ is proper, so $H^i = H^i_c$, then this formula shows that the Poincaré polynomial gives the number of $\mathbf F_q$-points if all the eigenvalues of $\mathrm{Frob}_q$ on $H^i$ are equal to $q^{i/2}$. This is usually stated by saying that $H^i$ is "pure Tate of weight $i$". A notable example of when you know that the cohomology is pure and Tate type is when the variety $X$ has an algebraic cell decomposition, i.e. a stratification where each stratum is isomorphic to an affine $n$-space $\mathbf A^n$. To prove this, one needs to use the long exact sequence of Galois representations $$ \cdots \to H^i_c(U) \to H^i(X) \to H^i(Z) \to H^{i+1}_c(U) \to \cdots, $$ where $U \subset X$ is open and $Z$ its closed complement. One takes $U \cong \mathbf A^n$ an open stratum of $X$. $Z$ has cohomology of pure Tate type (and in particular no odd cohomology!) by noetherian induction. This proves the claim for Grassmannians (the Bruhat decomposition) and also general Schubert varieties. 

I know very little about motives, but conjecturally you should expect that $h(E) \cong h(F) \otimes h(B)$. Your hypotheses imply that $E$ and $F \times B$ have isomorphic cohomology in the category of $\mathbf Q$-Hodge structures. In fact if $E \to B$ is smooth and proper, and $B$ is smooth and connected, then Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules implies degeneration of the Leray spectral sequence and that the Leray filtration splits in the category of mixed Hodge structures. The additional assumptions of locally trivial (I'm assuming this means in the category of complex analytic spaces) and trivial monodromy imply also that $H^p(B,R^q f_\ast \mathbf Q) \cong H^p(B) \otimes H^q(F)$. (It also implies more directly that Leray spectral sequence degenerates.) In any case, the conjectural functor (pure/mixed motives) $\to$ (pure/mixed $\mathbf Q$-Hodge structures) is conjectured to be fully faithful. This statement contains in particular the Hodge conjecture. So you should expect $E$ and $F\times B$ to have isomorphic motives, although proving this may be hard. On a sidenote, do you have any nontrivial examples of such fibrations? I have a hard time imagining one. 

There is the snappy model-theoretic proof of the Nullstellensatz, which goes by first proving that ACF_p, the theory of algebraically closed fields of some fixed characteristic p, is model complete. Once you know this it is easy: Let k be an algebraically closed field, and let m be a maximal ideal in k[x1,...,xn]. Let L be the algebraic closure of k[x1,...,xn]/m. We are trying to prove that there exists $a_1,...,a_n \in k$ which is a common zero of some set of generators for m. Note that this assertion is a first-order sentence using the language of fields and symbols in k. So model completeness of ACF_p tells us that this sentence is true in k if and only if it is true in some (and then every) algebraically closed extension field of k. But we know that this sentence is true in the algebraically closed extension L by construction, so we are done. 

I would call it a trivialization of the torsor. This terminology comes from the relative situation when one deals with principal bundles rather than principal homogeneous spaces. In this case, a trivialization would be a global section of the principal bundle $X \to Y$ (rather than a point of X), so a trivialization is the same thing as an isomorphism between X and the trivial bundle $G \times Y \to Y$. 

Maybe I'm missing something, but I think this should be a simpler proof. Let $j \colon U \hookrightarrow \mathbf P^n$ be the natural compactification, and let $k > 0$. Then $W_k H^k(U,\mathbf Q)$ is the image of $j^\ast \colon H^k(\mathbf P^n,\mathbf Q) \to H^k(U,\mathbf Q)$ (Hodge II, Corollaire 3.2.17). But $j^\ast$ factors through $H^k(\mathbf A^n, \mathbf Q) = 0$. 

A completely explicit definition that works over any ring is given as Proposition 18 in the following preprint of Malte Dehling and Bruno Vallette that was posted on the arXiv today. $URL$ 

There is a Künneth theorem in sheaf cohomology, which takes the form of an isomorphism between (complexes of) sheaves on $Y$. More precisely let $f : X \to Y$, $g : Z \to Y$ and $h : X \times_Y Z \to Y$, let $F$ and $G$ be sheaves on $X$ and $Z$ and denote by the same name their pullbacks to $X \times_Y Z$. Then there is an isomorphism in the derived category of $Y$ $$ Rf_\ast F \otimes^L Rg_\ast G \cong Rh_\ast (F \otimes^L G) $$ under some mild hypotheses that I'm not going to worry about (if you're forming arbitrary fibered products of manifolds then you're not worrying about precise hypotheses). So there is no Künneth theorem directly for the cohomology of $X \times_Y Z$, but if you compute the cohomology of $X \times_Y Z$ via the Leray spectral sequence for $X \times_Y Z \to Y$ then you see a Künneth formula. For details I highly recommend Dimca's book "Sheaves in topology". 

I think you mean to say that $X$ is the space parametrizing ordered $(d-3)$-tuples of pairwise distinct points in $\mathbf P^1$ with $\{0,1,\infty\}$ removed. Then $X$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal M_{0,d}$, which is the space of $d$ distinct ordered points on $\mathbf P^1$ modulo the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbf C)$. (Note that $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbf C)$ is the automorphism group of the Riemann sphere. $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf R)$ is the automorphism group of the upper half plane.) In general, the orbifold fundamental group of $\mathcal M_{g,d}$ is isomorphic to the mapping class group of a genus $g$ surface with $d$ ordered punctures. When $g=0$, the orbifold $\mathcal M_{0,d}$ is actually a manifold, and it does not matter in what sense one takes the fundamental group. I don't know any way of identifying $\pi_1(\mathcal M_{g,d})$ with the mapping class group that does not involve the action of the mapping class group on Teichmüller space. (Which is not to say that there couldn't be one.) In general it seems to me the most direct way possible to compute a fundamental group, to explicitly write down a universal cover and a group of deck transformations! 

The answer is yes when the scheme is flat and projective over the base. This follows from the existence of the Hom scheme, which in turn is proven via the existence of the Hilbert scheme. A readable reference is Nitin Nitsure's part of the book Fundamental algebraic geometry. In particular Theorem 5.23 in his notes states that when S is noetherian, X projective and flat over S, and Y quasi-projective over S, then there exists a Hom-scheme parametrizing morphisms from X to Y over S. (The precise definition of the functor that this scheme represents is given in the text). The automorphism group scheme of X is then an open subscheme of $\mathrm{Hom}_S(X,X)$. Addendum: The proof that Isom is open in Hom is very similar to the proof that Hom is open in Hilb. The map from the Hom scheme to $\mathrm{Hilb}_{X \times_S Y / S}$ is given by associating to a morphism $f : X \to Y$ its graph. Now the image consists of those $Z \subset X \times_S Y$ such that projection onto X induces an isomorphism $Z \cong X$, and the crucial part of the proof is showing that this is an open condition. (In Nitsure's notes this is Theorem 5.22.(b).) But then the condition that Z maps isomorphically onto Y is also open, and this is exactly the condition that defines the Isom scheme inside the Hom scheme. 

Note that the set $\{x \in \mathbf R^n: f(x) \neq 0\}$ is isomorphic to the set $\{(x,y) \in \mathbf R^{n+1} : f(x)y = 1\}$. Then the Milnor-Thom theorem gives the upper bound $d^{n+1}$ for the number of connected components. 

The mixed Hodge structure is in fact always split in this case. This is the main theorem of Alexey Gorinov, "A purity theorem for configuration spaces of smooth compact algebraic varieties", arXiv:1702.08428. 

This is due to Looijenga, Graber-Vakil, Faber-Pandharipande. Here $\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta. In the first three cases (which are perhaps the natural ones to consider) the top degree is in fact one-dimensional. One can also consider the virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) of all spaces above. The vcd of $M_{g,n}$ was determined by Harer; it is equal to $$ 4g-4+n + \delta_{0,g} - \delta_{0,n}. $$ The vcd of $\overline M_{g,n}$ is obviously equal to its (real) dimension, $6g-6+2n$. For $M_{g,n}^{ct}$ and $ M_{g,n}^{rt}$ the vcd is not known, but there is an upper bound due to Gabriele Mondello: the vcd is bounded by the virtual homotopical dimension (vhd), for which he finds the following bounds: $$ \mathrm{vhd}(M_{g,n}^{ct}) \leq 5g-6+2n,$$ $$ \mathrm{vhd}(M_{g,n}^{rt}) \leq 4g-5+2n - \delta_{0,g}.$$ Let's assume that these upper bounds for the virtual cohomological dimension are sharp. Then in all four cases above the following MYSTERY EQUATION is true: $$ \text{(vcd)} - \text{(top degree of taut. ring)} = 3g-3+n = \text{dimension over $\mathbf C$}. $$ Is there any plausible reason why something like this should be true?! 

Addendum. I think you are confused about some basic issues. Let us see why $BG^s$ is not the coarse moduli space of $BG$. Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite group, say. Consider for simplicity the topological setting, so we have a topological space $X$ and an open cover $\{U_i\}$. If we have a $G$-torsor on $X$ then we can restrict to a $G$-torsor on each $U_i$, and on each overlap $U_i \cap U_j$ we have isomorphisms between the restrictions from $U_i$ and from $U_j$. These isomorphisms satisfy cocycle relation. Conversely, if we have $G$-torsors on each $U_i$ and isomorphisms satisfying the cocycle relation, we can reconstruct a $G$-torsor on the whole of $X$, unique up to canonical isomorphism. What this paragraph says is exactly that the functor $BG$ which sends a space to the groupoid of $G$-torsors over it is a sheaf of groupoids, that is, a stack. (In the usual Grothendieck topology on the category of topological spaces, where open covers are, well, open covers. And when I call $BG$ a "functor" I should say "pseudofunctor" or "fibered category".) On the other hand we can consider $BG^s$, which is now a priori just a presheaf of sets, mapping a space to the set of isomorphism classes of $G$-torsors over it. If we have an isomorphism class of $G$-torsor on $X$ then we get well defined isomorphism classes of $G$-torsors on each $U_i$ with compatible restrictions to each $U_i \cap U_j$. But it is NOT true that if we have an isomorphism class of $G$-torsor on each $U_i$ which agree on double overlaps, then we can reconstruct a unique isomorphism class on all of $X$: consider the case when $G$ is nontrivial on $X$ and $\{U_i\}$ is a trivializing cover! What this says is that $BG^s$ is in fact only a presheaf - it is NEVER a sheaf of sets. Put simply, one can not glue together isomorphism classes. What this shows is in fact that if we sheafify $BG^s$, then we get a point. If we only remember isomorphism classes of torsors then every $G$-torsor becomes equivalent to the trivial torsor on some open covering of your space, which means that these torsors are identified under sheafification. The same arguments work verbatim in algebraic geometry, since every $G$-torsor is locally trivial in the étale topology. In any case, this is why I said above that this is not the "right" question to ask: it is not natural to expect $\X^s$ to be a sheaf in the first place. I would suggest reading Heinloth or Fantechi's notes on stacks (they are somewhere online) and thinking over just what question it is you want to ask. 

Your question reminds me of Grothendieck's Esquisse d'un Programme, specifically the notion of "tame topology". Was this on your mind when posing the question? I am thinking of the part that starts like this: After some ten years, I would now say, with hindsight, that “general topology” was developed (during the thirties and forties) by analysts and in order to meet the needs of analysis, not for topology per se, i.e. the study of the topological properties of the various geometrical shapes. That the foundations of topology are inadequate is manifest from the very beginning, in the form of “false problems” (at least from the point of view of the topological intuition of shapes) such as the “invariance of domains”, even if the solution to this problem by Brouwer led him to introduce new geometrical ideas. Even now, just as in the heroic times when one anxiously witnessed for the ﬁrst time curves cheerfully ﬁlling squares and cubes, when one tries to do topological geometry in the technical context of topological spaces, one is confronted at each step with spurious diﬃculties related to wild phenomena. To me the notion of a "false problem" is a very succinct way of expressing the problems associated with going from (1) to (2) in your formulation, at least if I have understood your question correctly. Namely, in a first course in point-set topology, one spends a lot of time learning about topologist's sine curves, long lines and Sorgenfrey planes, and the problem is that all of these are cooked up to solve/exemplify problems that are "false", i.e. not very natural/interesting to someone who actually does geometry in his day-to-day life. If we then believe Grothendieck, the problem is not one of didactics at all: the difficulties in passing from (1) to (2) are an inevitable byproduct of the fact that point-set topology is not adequate as a framework for geometry. Maybe this is true. In a first topology course, one does need to spend time on pathological behavior, simply because anyone who does topology should know that a topological space with no extra conditions can be weird and not very geometric. I think this will be true as long as topological spaces are considered the basic framework for topology. Then one does have to unlearn the instinct to think about pathologies when actually doing topology. On the other hand, of course you can't tell students in a first topology course that the pathological spaces they are learning about will not actually be so useful later in life; no one would learn the material after hearing something like that. I suspect that I have just restated what you said in a clumsier manner. 

This "answer" will basically restate the comments of Marty and Jason Starr. Any variety covered by schemes of the form $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbf Z[M_i])$, or any torified variety, is rational. And indeed Severi conjectured at one point that $M_g$ is rational for any $g$! But we know a lot about the Kodaira dimension of $M_g$ by work of Harris--Mumford, Farkas, Eisenbud, Verra, ... in particular we know that Severi's conjecture is maximally false. We have $\kappa(M_g) = -\infty$ for $g \leq 16$, we don't know anything for $17 \leq g \leq 21$, and $\kappa(M_g) \geq 0$ for $g \geq 22$. In fact we know that $M_{g}$ is of general type for $g = 22$ and $g \geq 24$. But if one only wants an example of a $g$ for which $M_g$ is not rational, then I think one can find examples much earlier (maybe $g \approx 6,7$?). See $URL$ for a survey by Farkas. Moreover, the cohomology of a torified scheme can only contain mixed Tate motives. In particular, this implies properties like: the number of $\mathbf F_q$-points is a polynomial function of $q$. As Marty says there are no problems in genus zero; these might be honest-to-God $\mathbf F_1$ schemes. The cohomology of $M_{1,n}$ contains only mixed Tate motives when $n \leq 10$, but for $n \geq 11$ one finds motives associated to cusp forms for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbf Z)$. (The number 11 arises as one less than the smallest weight of a nonzero cusp form; the discriminant form $\Delta$.) This implies that the polynomiality behaviour changes drastically -- the number of $\mathbf F_q$-points is now given by Fourier coefficients of modular forms, which are far more complicated and contain lots of arithmetic information. The connection with birational geometry is also very visible here. The cohomology classes on $M_{1,n}$ associated to the cusp forms of weight $n+1$ are of type $(n,0)$ and $(0,n)$ in the Hodge realization, since given such a cusp form one can explicitly write down a corresponding differential form in coordinates. So by the very definition of Kodaira dimension we can not have $\kappa = -\infty$ anymore. Bergström computed the Euler characteristic of $M_{2,n}$ in the Grothendieck group of $\ell$-adic Galois representations by point counting techniques. That is, he found formulas for the number of $\mathbf F_q$-points of $M_{2,n}$ by working really explicitly with normal forms for hyperelliptic curves. These formulas turned out to be polynomial in $q$ for $n \leq 7$ (and conjecturally for $n \leq 9$), just as they would be if we knew that the cohomology of $M_{2,n}$ contained only mixed Tate motives. By thinking a bit about the stratification of topological type, one concludes that this holds also for $\overline M_{2,n}$ when $n \leq 7$, which is smooth and proper over the integers. Then a theorem of van den Bogaart and Edixhoven implies that the cohomology of $\overline M_{2,n}$ is all of Tate type and with Betti numbers given by the coefficients of the polynomials. There are similar results by Bergström for $M_{3,n}$ when $n \leq 5$ and Bergström--Tommasi for $M_4$. But the general phenomenon is that increasing either $g$ or $n$ will rapidly take you out of the world of $\mathbf F_1$-schemes, at least if this is taken to mean "commutative monoids". However, I don't know enough $\mathbf F_1$--geometry to say what the answer is if one takes $\mathbf F_1$-schemes in the sense of Borger. The first nontrivial case to answer would be: are the motives associated to cusp forms for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbf Z)$ defined over $\mathbf F_1$ in his set-up? To be clear, I don't believe that this is true, but I know almost nothing about $\lambda$-schemes. Let me also make two small remarks: (i) Everything I have written above is necessary conditions for being defined over $\mathbf F_1$. (ii) The fact that $M_{g,n}$ is smooth over the integers says that the cohomology of $M_{g,n}$ is at least quite "special", even though it is not defined over $\mathbf F_1$. Smoothness is a strong restriction on the Galois representations that can occur in the cohomology.
