They don't believe you will declare your illegal income. It's a way to stack more potential crimes and charges on those who are criminals. Sometimes you'll get the weird result of the criminal being found not guilty on major criminal charges, but then getting found guilty of not paying taxes on criminal income, despite being cleared on the other charges. Al Capone, one of the most notorious and violent criminal mob bosses of the Prohibition Era was never convicted of the many murders or other violent crimes he ordered or participated in. He went to jail for income tax evasion. 

It is correct that she represented a rapist. The characterization how she got on that case, what she did, and what she was saying on tape is completely and intentionally wrong, though. 

No, it isn't. I'm not sure if there is a similar headline-to-story mismatch in the cited article (firewall at work), but for the question, the title does not match the claim. "a reason for a third of divorces last year in which unreasonable behavior was a factor" <> "one third of all." Most divorces do not fault a partner's behavior as a reason for the divorce. That's a pretty huge qualifier in the statement. 

It can, but indirectly. Note - this assumes that someone with urinary incontinence issues, in general, might have issues when sneezing as well. 

StackExchange AskDifferent: Is charging iPhone all night harmful to my iPhone? Now, these references are specific to the iPhone, but the technology (despite Samsung's previous battery issues) is similar or equivalent between most modern phones. 

Whether "few people" knew him or not is an impossible assessment to make. How does one judge that? How many Facebook friends he has? So, even though we hate to do this on this particular stack exchange, we have to look at what Trump is claiming. It's pretty clear that he's claiming that this person was a nobody, in terms of importance, and clearly not connected to him, directly. So, very likely, he is lying, in that context. Papadopoulos was part of Trump's primary five-person foreign policy team. He named him, by name, to the Washington Post, and described him as "an excellent guy." I guess him being named in a prominent newspaper also technically makes it false that "few people knew him," since the Washington Post is the second-most read information source, reaching tens of millions of readers every month. Ironically, the reason we can rate that claim to be false is thanks to Trump's own introduction of him as a member of his foreign policy advisory team. WP: The Washington Post surges to 76 million monthly users WP: The Washington Post reached 107 million readers in November 2016 That's a person who directly interacts with the President, and has access that others don't. If anyone wants to contest this as lies or "fake," in addition to the transcript of the meeting, there is the audio of it, as well. Washington Post: A transcript of Trump's meeting with the Washington Post Editorial Board There is also a photo of Papadopoulos in a meeting with Trump and about 8 or 9 other high level administration personnel, including eventual cabinet-level people. He's seated right at the table, not in the background somewhere, four people to Trump's right. Low-level nobodies don't "get a seat at the table." 

Note the very specific and somewhat odd choice of verb. Not "heard," not "knew," not "reported," but "COPIED." The refutation: 

Coffee grind size: Why it matters and what you should be using They certainly do. A finer grind exposes more of the grounds to the water, releasing more oils, and flavor components, both good and bad (depending on what you like). A finer grind will be stronger flavored, but also more bitter, for instance. Depending on filtration method, it can also lead to more or less particles of the coffee grinds winding up in your cup. If the size of the grind didn't matter, you wouldn't have distinct types of coffee calling for specific grind sizes. So, we've established that a blade grinder will lead to more variability in the final size of the coffee grounds, and we've established that different levels of grind size do lead to different flavors and consistency, even when starting with the same beans. By definition, a coffee with more uniform ground size is going to have a different taste than one with a variable grind size. EDIT: Contrary to my assumption, this matter is not too trivial for actual scientific study. There was a study in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture that looked at extraction variables as they apply, specifically, to espresso served in coffee shops, but there's nothing about this that makes it exclusive to espresso. They note that consistency of grind and standardization as the #1 factor affecting the outcome or taste. Thanks to OddThinking for pushing me for more verification of this. - From the abstract: 

Yes and no, to be honest. There was no requirement that players be on the field for the anthem for all games. However, there was no rule or policy that they stay in the looker room, either. Basically, where the players were depended more on the logistics of the spectacle of the game, before 2009. Prime time games, played at times other than the standard game times (Sundays, 1 PM ET and 4 PM ET) would have the field cleared so the network could set up the pre-game logistics without having to work around players milling about the field. Regular-timed games were on a tighter schedule, so the players were already on the field and ready to go right after the anthem. Being on that tighter schedule, the anthem was generally not broadcast before the regular-time games. Spokespeople for the NFL have said on several occasions - 

The "damage" done by screens is in the form of eye strain. Your eyeball focuses by using muscles in the eye to change the shape of the lens within the eye, to properly focus incoming light onto the correct portion of the retina. 

He never claimed to have translated or deciphered anything, so this doesn't say anything to what Cash actually said. It sounds like his job was identifying when Morse code was being used, and literally copying down the Morse code sequences, not translating them. Copied, then passed off to Morse Code, cryptoanalysts and Russian language specialists to transcribe. You can down-vote this as having nothing authoritative in the answer, but I don't think there's anything disputing Cash's actual claim. It's more that people didn't note his careful parsing of his own language in making his claim (which could be what he had in mind), and made assumptions, and reported it as a claim that he never actually made. 

Did Clinton believe the person committed the crime? Not sure why that's relevant. She wasn't the judge. She wasn't on the jury. She was the defending attorney, and was legally and ethically obligated to give him the best defense she was capable of. Did she brag about getting the evidence excluded? She talked about it, because she was asked. Is that "bragging?" Did Clinton laugh in an interview? Yes, she laughed, but it was more an ironic laugh of disbelief as she detailed about how everything that SHOULD have worked against the defendant wound up turning around and working in his favor. The DNA evidence getting destroyed by the lab. She had her client take a polygraph, and he passed it. She laughed as she recounted that, while saying that this caused her to question the credibility of polygraph tests, in general. Does any of that matter? She didn't get her client acquitted, he pled guilty to a lesser crime, which is how most cases are handled. Doesn't the lesser crime conviction show she did him a great service? Again, she was supposed to serve to the best of her ability, but, no. The mother of the victim was aggressively pushing for a plea deal, to close the books on the incident and to avoid them having to go through a trial.

Yes, it would taste different. Comparing "better" or not is irrelevant, since the question asks simply if it is "different." Here is why it's different: What is the difference between blade- and burr-ground coffee? Consistency/uniformity of the grind. 

Wikipedia: Scholarly peer review By his own examination, 80% caught errors in the submitted papers, so in 80% of the cases the paper would have undergone some correction or not published as it was, and that's before the more rigorous post-publication review process. That means, in 80% of those cases, the paper would have been improved in the pre-publication process. That's quite different than "no evidence" of improvement. Mind you, catching some, but not all, errors is an improvement. Sounds like his claims don't match with his data. Perhaps if he would have submitted his speech as a paper, it would not have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. 

The problem is the Heritage Foundation is redefining "voter fraud" when the accepted definition does not match with their narrative. To be fair, they use the correct term of "election fraud" which is much broader, but then they introduce it as relevant to a discussion about voter ID and voter fraud. Usually, when claims like that are made, analysis finds that most of what they refer to are "voter registration" issues, which is a completely different matter. If they are counting "election fraud" where those in charge of administering the elections and tallying the vote counts try to cook the system, then that is yet a completely different category of activities, as well. When it comes to actually casting ineligible votes, it's also noteworthy that most often they are by felons who are unaware that they are still ineligible to vote (states differ on whether and for how long ex-convicts are still not allowed to vote after having been released from prison). That's noteworthy because if I say "I'm PoloHoleSet, here's my ID" - which confirms my identity, and I try to vote when I'm ineligible, that's not something that would be prevented by a voter ID, especially if I supply a valid voter ID. I note this because these statistics are often trotted out when defending restrictive voter ID legislation, despite that they are citing, almost exclusively, cases that are unrelated to identification and would not be prevented by those laws. 

I don't know, for sure, if he did, but please note the disconnect between Cash's claim, and the refutation. I would think that Cash and his obvious musical talent/genius would be very good at discerning fine details in both tone and meter/rhythm, which would make him an "ace" at identifying Morse Code from background noise. Cash's claim, per OP - 

So the answer would be "yes, but not magically or dramatically." - within the narrow parameters of body fat and, possibly, other anti-oxidants. Efficacy of conjugated inoleic acid for reducing fat mass: a meta-analysis in humans 

Pre-publication peer review is not supposed to catch all errors or mistakes. It's a relatively superficial review (they aren't going to generally perform a rigorous study to validate or invalidate the findings in the pre-publication step) to see if basic, remedial standards of professionalism have been followed before publication. 

If you want to look at the most narrow of answers, the answer is "yes." If you are looking to confirm whether the characterizations of this case are in any way accurate. Then I've laid out some more details for you. Snopes article about the claims GWU's Jonathan Turley's legal blog about the claims 

No, according to reporting, they wanted everyone to know about it the hacks well in advance. Republicans wanted it kept quiet. There were reports and concerns going back to 2015. In September, there was an official finding by the CIA (but not a unified finding by all 17 national security agencies because of disagreements on some of the details) that they were hacking, and hacking to influence a particular result (Trump). The Obama administration was grappling for some time with how to deal with this without appearing to be trying to skew the results, themselves. With the official finding and report, they felt that a unified, bi-partisan approach would be the way to go. One difference between September and now that would account for the stronger statements, and not just the election result, is that our intelligence agencies have had more time to gather and analyze information. In September, there were all the leaks of DNC and Clinton-related emails from hacks. They knew one side had been breached, they also knew there were some minor confirmed breaches on the other side, and several thwarted attempts. The GOP claimed the one-sided nature of the leaks was because their information was better secured. What came out more recently is that intelligence agencies were able to confirm that the GOP was also breached/hacked in a similar manner, and much more information was taken. It's this information - that both sides were compromised, but only one side seems to have had their information leaked, that lead to the greater confidence of malicious, one-sided intent.
