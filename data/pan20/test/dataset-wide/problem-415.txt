EDIT: @Tom, as you can see, I needed more space to respond to your comment. Remember that "dimensions" are an arbitrary form of catagorizing observable measurement, not universal constants (and certainly not places to visit). Time happens to be something measurable, that's all. Therefore, there is nothing gravitons can escape "into." Perhaps the best way to say it is, could there exist a creature who can observe more than three dimensions of measurement? If so, how would gravitons affect such a creature? Such a creature doesn't "exist" in a "4th dimension." Said creature would exist in our universe just as we do. It's passage before us would, perhaps, be perceived as a 3D "flicker" as our passage through time happens to coinside momentarily with his (oohhh... ghosts...). This reflects the example from the video I suggested where passing your hand before a 2D being would result in its seeing a series of modulating edges as the 3D hand passed through its 2D vision. The reason, perhaps, there is so much confusion in the world about this is the tesseract. A tesseract is a "four-dimensional" cube where the fourth dimension is NOT time. It's a theoretical geometric construct that works like this: If you start with a one-dimensional point, creating a 2D line is done by drawing a line from that point in any direction to a second point (doubling the number of points). A shadow cast by light shining along the line's angle of protrusion is a point. Creating a square means drawing equal length (that's important) lines at 90-degree angles from the first two points to encompass a total of four points (doubling the number of points). A shadow cast by light shining along the square's angle of protrusion is a line. Creating a cube means drawing equal length (remember, this is important) lines at 90-degree angles from the existing four points to encompass a total of eight points (doubling the number of points). A shadow cast by light shining along the cube's angle of protrusion is a square. Creating a tesseract means drawing equal length lines at 90-degree angles from the existing eight points to encompass a total of sixteen points (doubling the number of points). A shadow cast by light shining along the tesseract's angle of protrusion is a cube (and we just ran out of reality as there is no evidence of an emissive source that could do this). Can you see the problem? You can model it mathematically, but you can't build it because there isn't a way to spatially align more equal length lines at 90-degree angles. The "space" doesn't exist. It's only a mathematical concept as it cannot be measured (like time). That's why "inter-dimensional travel" is (at least at this time) a nonsensical concept. With the exception of the mathematical and geometric exercise of a tesseract, "dimensions" are identified as things that can be measured... even by us in a "lower" dimension. 

Not a tree in sight. Almost nothing larger than sage brush. Habitable only because there's fish in the reservoir. I think of it as a wasteland... and I've seen worse. I've seen reservoirs where, despite all the water, barely anything grows. So, let's talk about localized wastelands. Sandy or Volcanic Soil One way to make a wasteland is to make the soil sandy or volcanic. Water isn't retained in the soil. Sandy soil would usually result in an aquifer, meaning deep rooted stuff will grow (aka, desert plants). Volcanic is even worse. No Bacteria Soil needs bacteria — a lot of bacteria — to sustain plant growth. If an apocalypse killed everything down to the bacteria, there would be no plant growth. And it would take a very long time to recover (it takes organics to create the bacteria needed to create organics... a nasty little truth). Coal Seams The Centralia Coal Fire has been burning since 1962. The area around the coal seam is a wasteland due to the higher soil heat. Coal seams can burn for centuries and while all those I know about were man-made (you know, "stupid human" problems), technically a lightening strike can get them going so long as a portion of the seam is open to the sky. Rocky, really rocky Flood Basalt is what you get when volcanism leaves sheets of rock over massive areas. The ultra-rocky soil is usually anything but lush. Dead Lake Areas An inland lake with no outlet like Utah's Great Salt Lake or the Middle East's Dead Sea is a scrappy area due to the high salt content, especially if it's at a higher altitude like the Great Salt Lake. Consider also the Bonneville Salt Flats, the high-salt desert left behind when Lake Bonneville drained away. High Altitudes Finally, everything above the treeline is scrappy. A mountainous (think "Tibet" mountainous) region would have very limited vegitation only in lower canyon areas. 

EMP isn't magic. It's little more than what is experienced by a generator. The plane is passing through a dense magnetic field just as the generator's wire is passing through a (locally) dense magnetic field. The theoretical threat of an EMP is that it carries so much energy that things are damaged. But that doesn't change the physics of delivery. If the plane is sheeted in conductive metal, then the fusalage skin is getting all (100%) of the energy. That's what's passing through the field first, and it has by far the largest conductive path to absorb the energy. So the real question is, what is the skin connected to? Modern automobiles, for example, connect the chassis, frame, skin (if metal), etc., to the negative pole of the battery. It makes the car's electronics easy to reference (voltage reference or ground reference). I'd be surprised if airplanes didn't do the same thing for the same reason. This means the first (and likely only) thing damaged is the battery. And the easiest way to protect against EMP is to add more battery, or to create some electricity-consuming device (like an arc generator) that could dump overvoltage energy. I have not looked into the effect of EMP on automobiles, but I'm willing to bet that cars that survive are metal-skinned cars and cars that don't are fiberglass/plastic skinned cars. Further, the chassis/frame, motor, etc., are all so large that they'll absorb the energy long before wires or computers. The only way the computers would be damaged is if they're not begind something large and metalic (referenced from the direction of the emp source) or not shielded (encased) in metal. Solution: build the planes with metal skin, connect the negative post of the battery to the skin with thick cables, use a lot of batteries or design an over-voltage shunt that dumps excess energy to an electricity-consuming device like an arc generator. 

The shield idea is interesting, a bit like ablative armor, but its greatest limitation is the resource: iron. Unless you're hauling around a bazillion metric tons of it, you'll quickly run out of it. In fact, you could depend on your enemies developing weapons designed to vaporaize vast amounts of it just to clear it out of the way. As for current-tech solutions, there aren't any. We don't have shielding today, nor is any technology remotely close to providing one. However, you're not on the wrong track. Let's use some handwaving and suggest that you have a nuclear force shield, one that has the strength of the nuclear bonds between atomic particles, and that shield is rotating around the ship. It's purpose is to capture and redirect objects away from the ship (not unlike a street sweeper). I don't think this has been done before, and no mass-oriented object would be capable of penetrating it unless the energy of that object exceeded the energy applied to the shield. 

So, frankly, all you need to do is use this (or its future equivalent) and identify the synchronizing "epoch" (not disimilar to the Unix Epoch) after which the two measurements are perfectly aligned and can be used to convert from local time to "solar universal time" (which, obviously, will be Earth time, 'cause the motherland is where it's at....) An alternative is to use a definition like Ephemeris Time, which was created literally to solve this problem. 

But, despite these observations from a man who knows more about physics than I ever expect to know about anything and everything in my entire life, there is a question that is really important... Why do you want to know? If you're writing fiction, then allow it or not. There's enough mathematics and enough opinions in both directions that you can use the concept (as a great many already have) in any way you wish. The simple reality here is that nobody knows. Nobody! Wormholes, higher dimensions, time travel, are all extrapolations from theoretical physics that are described in mathematics but not actually proven to exist in any way, shape, or form. Your guess is as good as ours — there's simply no actual proof. So, tell yourself yes or tell yourself no, either is as good as the other. 

Let's start with the ugly stuff. Nuclear fission produces the really ugly radition, but it goes away quickly. Fusion doesn't produce anywhere near the same fallout radiation, but what's left over takes forever to go away. My source suggests the fission problems follow the "rule of 7." Every 7 days the radiation drops 90%. From this perspective, the surface is "radiation free" (or, basically the way we live today) in less than 100 years. But that's not the problem. Fusion produces (listen to me sound like I know what I'm talking about. My thanks to that source!) ...produces tritium and C-14 carbon. These can be absorbed into DNA and therefore cause mutations (usually death-dealing cancer, but who knows, there might be a spider-man out there!). Tritium's half-life is about 12 years, but C-14's half-life if almost 6,000 years. That means the plants are mutating... and anything eating the plants are mutating... for six millenia. Ugh. But that's not the problem. The problem is the consequence of being forced to adapt to those circumstances. 6,000 years isn't enough time to evolve, only to adapt. No new species, but maybe improved species. At least, "improved" in terms of radioactive tolerance. The problem is that once DNA is affected, it can take forever and a day to weed out the genetic (and potentially hereditary) anomolies. The radioactive carbon is gone in 6,000 years (no new mutations! Yay!) but the genetic defects will take who knows how long to go away. That's the problem, the time it takes real and honest evolution to work out the genetically weak and leave only the genetically strong. That could be a long honkin' time. 

Would sanctioned polygyny have stopped Henry VIII from forming the Anglican Church? This is what you're really asking, isn't it? The answer might have been yes, but Henry's famous desire for an heir was by no means the beginning of the schism between English government and Rome. 

What would be the evolutionary advantage to this? A wider range of sound frequencies may (maybe) allow for a more complicated communication ... but we already have languages that range from very simple to unbelievably complex. So, while I provide some insight with my answer, please bear in mind that this evolutionary development doesn't actually make sense. I can envision a second set of chords systemically in three ways Series: The two vocal chords are in series, meaning one immediately follows the other in the tracheal path. This solution means the second set of chords modulates the first set of chords. I imagine the result to be little different from passing an audio signal through a sound post-processor. You can easily obtain a drone effect (one or more harmonic tones in the background of the primary chord) or produce secondary effects such as shifting tone, producing reverbration, or maybe even the vocal equivalent of a cosmic wah. You could make yourself sound like your own talk box. Parallel: The two vocal chords are in parallel, meaning the tracheal path splits to deliver 50% of the air to each chord, which ostensibly could be actuated independently. I imagine this could give rise to two independent frequencies, but only insofar as those frequencies are not shaped by the hollow of the mouth and throat, which are common to both vocal chords. This could give rise to a very rich voice, capable of providing its own contrasting harmony. Note that I do not believe this would achieve the idea of singing with two voices. It would only add depth to the single voice and complexity to communication with distinct secondary frequencies following a primary frequency. For example, English-speaking humans ask a question and usually raise the frequency of the sound as the question comes to an end. A parallel-chord being could add a second frequency to the first, providing more information about the nature of the asked question. Integrated: An integrated dual vocal chord is a single voice box in the trachea that contains two separate sets of chords — or, perhaps more obviously, it has twice the number of "chords." I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure how this would sound, other than to provide a greater range of frequencies (adding chords to the same basic space requires the new chords to be smaller, suggesting a higher frequency range).
