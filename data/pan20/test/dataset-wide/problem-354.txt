Your primitives would have easy access to lots of high grade tools. The most interesting here are those which are easily understood and used and do not need to be powered by electricity. Axes are already known, they will get excellent steel versions. Hammers are easily understandable. Saws will be a new tool, but easy to figure out. Again, children’ picture books come in handy. The problem with these is that they will degrade over time. It will depend on how much is stored in advance. Further interesting tools are shovels, pick axes, cooking ware, high end ceramics, steel needles of all variants, surgical tools … oh and foam filled rubber wheels (great for much better transportation). Replacing these tools will not be easy. But the people will have experienced a basic understanding of these advanced tools and will want to reproduce them. Most likely they will first use bronze, but they will look out for the metal, these tools were made from and work from there. 

EDIT 2: For the sake of this question "visible" means visible to the naked human eye and/or technology available in the late medieval period of our world (ca. 15th century). A solution using atmospheric conditions are perfectly fine as long as this does not infringe on the habitability of the planet and these conditions are the same from any point of the planet. EDIT 3: There are no restrictions on the perceived colour of the moon in the sky. It can be any colour, as long as it stays visible in the night and still give some light during the night. You can postulate any changes to our system that have no or marginal effects like described above and achieve the desired result. If this effect is not achievable with the restrictions declared above, please state why. 

Use clothing that enables you to avoid leaving a scent for this entire operation (haz-mat suit coated in environmental fodder). Observe animal from a distance for a day, at least, noting sleeping habits, diet, temperament, etc. Find where it sleeps (as it's a warm-blooded mammal, it most likely utilize a centralized sleeping location). Test its sleeping patterns. While it is sleeping, systematically come closer at a constant pace until you disturb its rest. Mark the distance (there is no time compensation you need to do. The animal should be aware of its power's limitation, and would therefore run at the first sign of danger rather than time-jump. It would save that ability for emergencies. The 30 second ability would mean that you could have gotten closer for 30 seconds. for this situation, being further away is preferable. Either way, the point at which the animal moves should be perfect) Create an enclosure nearby which is over twice the distance from the creature's den to the mark you have made. The enclosure must be open on the side facing the current den. The opening must be large enough so as not to 'tip off' the creature. Assuming it is of animal-level intelligence, make it around two to three times the width and height of its body. The door of the enclosure must be as silent as possible, and well-oiled. Wait for it to leave its den again, then wait at least 90 seconds from that point. Examine the sleeping area, noting the materials, size, smells, etc. Take items/pieces of the sleeping area, using gloves and other means to mask scent. recreate the den in the center of your enclosure, using pieces of the old den. When the animal leaves its own den again, destroy the sleeping area after 90 seconds, taking more pieces and scattering them in a trail leading to the new den. Use food with the other pieces. Wait for the animal to follow your trail, leading to the new den, which, as it smells like its old den, and not like you, and contains easily attainable food, the animal will utilize. wait 90 seconds after the animal has fallen asleep, using the well-oiled and quiet mechanism. The enclosure's size would help avoid spooking the animal. This would make the door seem like no threat to the animal itself, circumventing the 30s power (why be concerned with what's happening 30 seconds from now if it's not a threat) allow the animal to sleep and awake naturally. Upon it stirring, use the openings in the enclosure to leave food for it. continue feeding it regularly. Begin to introduce items that contain your smell. Start these items off at the edge of the enclosure, away from the food. This will familiarize the animal with you. the outer clothing is no longer needed. Discard it. Begin to make appearances as far from the animal as possible, while still being seen. Bring and deposit food at these points. Over time this will let the animal associate you with the food. behavior allowing, continue to bring the food, but go closer and closer to the animal. Eventually, this will create a bond with the creature. From this point, follow common animal husbandry behavior until you are able to touch the animal, and then more until you are able to attach the tag secure it. Make sure to retreat each time the animal retreats. Release the animal. 

Considering all this I think that you could easily shave off between 1,000 and 4,000 years of development. That would still mean a pretty long time to advance to the point where we are today, but it could skip a pretty long time of very slow developments, between around 5,000 BC and 1,000 BC. It should be noted though that this requires no huge losses of knowledge through other interferences besides natural degradation. War between the “primitives” or further advanced tribes or natural disasters could lead to the same destruction of knowledge and stalled development we experienced for example after the fall of Rome or the Bronze Age collapse. 

Jump starting the agriculture is the first thing your “primitives” will be interested in. If they find one or more of the aforementioned children’ books on farming, they will get some interesting ideas how to advance their farming techniques. Finding pictures of modern plows drawn by a tractor will give them a massive head start. The plough was first used in Egypt around 5,000 BC (give or take). Having access to much better plows will greatly help farming, increasing yield and taking less time. While tractors will likely not be used by the primitives, they can use oxen to draw the plough. They will also find hints to modern irrigation techniques. Even better for them are the modern domesticated species. While around 5,000 BC the Neolithic Revolution already had happened, the much better “optimized” farm animals of our modern age will provide an immense multiplier to food yields be it milk, eggs, crops or meat. This requires of course, that seeds and animal herds have also been left for the primitives. Another very important domesticated plant is cotton, which would also come with a significant advancement in the timeline. 

No, it can't appear in nature because there is no addition of new water, and as the water falls off at the water falls, it is not replenished. The only way to achieve this would be with a colossal pump under the lake pushing up massive quantities of water, basically making it a colossal fountain. If you want something naturally occurring and similar, the most similar scenario would be that it has a higher cliff face on one edge from which more water pours down, replenishing the waterfalls. You would also likely need to town back the water falls. 

Given that many Dragons also have claws, the wing spikes could be vestigial appendages that once were claws. They could also possibly be used in self defense, though the movement of a wing isn't designed for stabbing forward with significant force. 

Unless I am greatly mistaken, there isn't even a need to move the reactor. You can simply route cables from the reactor to other buildings or tools in order to give them electricity. I assume this ship is landing? If so it could likely itself be a central structure to the colony, that serves many functions early on, including housing the initial nuclear reactor. 

While some of the answers have rightfully pointed out the difficulties of a Bronze Age civilization to use this “gift” properly to their advantage, I have a slightly more optimistic outlook and like to focus on the best possible course of action the civilization can take. Note that I will assume some additional information missing in your question. It will make a huge difference whether or not the Bronze Age people stumbling over the remnant of a modern city is a small clan living in a nearby village or one of the early civilizations with a large population and infrastructure of their own. 

On earth there can be hours where the moon is up during the same time the sun is in the sky (daytime moon) due to the combined rotation of earth and orbit of the moon. I would like to have an earth-like planet which never has the moon and the sun visible in the sky at the same time from any point of the planets surface. Is this possible without too much interference with the earth-like state of the planet? Ideally the reason for the lack of simultaneous visibility does not effect the stabilising function of the moon for the planet's hability as well as has no significant effects on the planets seasons and day and night cycle. In general consider the planet, the moon and the whole solar system to be the same than ours. EDIT for clarification: Ideally the planet has a 

THE NSA IS MONITORING OUR THOUGHTS!!! Fear everything! Tin foil hats will protect you though. One major reason people might not want to communicate telepathically is because people could listen in, whether using natural telepathic abilities, or complicated machinery that intercepts telepathic signals (And is potentially able to intercept transmissions form a long distance). If the government, or worse other even more nefarious mafia-esque groups were listening, you wouldn't want to broadcast sensitive data. The telepathic equivalent of sexting would provide a great opportunity to blackmail people if intercepted, and the government listening in is just creepy. 

Death! Attempting to somehow reverse a person into the body of a ten year old would almost certainly kill them. The only way to get around this would be time travel, or ludicrously complicated technology designed to intentionally turn someone into a child. (And we're talking massive surgeries, manipulation on the cellular level, probably a lot of tissue grafting from a younger clone, or maybe it would be easier to just transplant their brain in to a young clone.) I assume your age reversal is supposed to turn back our "Biological clock?" If this is the case reverting someones biological clock to how it was when they were 10 would not only not shrink them back to a 10 year old, it would start them growing again, and the growth would likely prove lethal, as a human heart is not capable of supporting such a large person. (People who have pituitary issues and don't stop growing become vert ill and die.) 

You certainly have a conundrum on your hands. Ultimately, you have a ruling class (those that control power) and various factions of a lower class. Like the current reality we live in, the lower class will be more numerous than the ruling class. When you consider what a weapon is, you come up with a simple answer... equality. A weapon is a tool that allows its user (or group of users) to kill the intended target while taking the importance off of the individual's (or group's) physical strength (to varying degrees). A weapon is needed when there is either a, an initiation of force against a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous target; or b, a defense against force initiated by a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous aggressor. This covers hunting, war, defense... basically any situation which could call for a weapon. Our current method of manufacturing our currently use weapons is both time and resource intensive. Our current stockpile WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. Without contemporary manufacturing of such weapons, there wouldn't be any reliably usable versions of modern weaponry. This ruling class you have obviously controls the means of production (they control the power) so they could feasibly control knowledge as well. If you include a way of passively defending themselves (using said power source as a shield around their island) which needs a unique device to bypass (identification pendants or some kind of genetic reader), and you have a reason why they wouldn't need weapons, and therefore would want to restrict their usage. All the lower class characters would need food, so it's safe to assume bows and arrows, spears, and other primitive weapons have resurged. Basically, you don't have weapons because the upper class is more secure without them than with them. 

Solar Radiation may be best suited to your needs. If Solar Radiation were increased it could kill plants over vast areas, starting spreading from the equator. This would also be very inhospitable to humans without protective suits. Volcanic Activity is of course another option, if your planet is very geologically unstable then it could have large areas be prone to lava flows, covered in volcanic rock, or poisoned with acid. Post apocalyptic radiation Did they drop the bomb? If so it was probably targeted at more heavily populated regions built in fertile areas. These may no longer be inhabitable. Low Water Content Planet Obviously your planet doesn't have to share Earth's exact composition, if it has less water then it would have larger desert regions. Frozen Deserts Antartica is the worlds largest desert, but it doesn't seem to be exactly what you had in mind. 

This problem is one of the main reasons given why space soldiers carry pulse rifles. An electrical discharge can theoretically fry a human while not posing the same risk of causing a hull breach. However firing bullets inside of your space ship is generally not going to be a good idea. Even without causing a hull breach there are many other systems you can easily breach from the inside. Also if a projectile is kept weak enough to not pierce a space ship hull it stands to reason that your enemies would simply increase the thickness of their armor to equal or slightly exceed your hulls strength. If you are set on using physical bullets however, the easiest solution is a shotgun style weapon that fires tiny bullets at incredible speeds. When tightly packed the concentrated force could blast through armor, but if you miss and they fly further the spread would make them less dangerous to hulls. This is not however a remotely fool proof weapon, and anyone planning on using these would likely put on an oxygen mask before firing. The only fool proof projectiles would be "smart-bullets" that were able to identify when they were on a trajectory toward the hull and self detonate to spread out the force. However these would likely be incredibly complex,expensive, and hard to manufacture. You may also want to consider melee weapons, as it is harder to accidentally pierce the hull with a hand held weapon.
