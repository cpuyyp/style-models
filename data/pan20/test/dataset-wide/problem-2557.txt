Its nothing bad, if one, for example, would remember the virtue of beings having become gods. The benefits are following in this link. Being attached to wholesome deeds is also nothing wrong, but wise, even if they are still rituals. They can not become natural if not practiced as ritual first. As for wrong view, yes in certain aspects, since such as believing in an external power (in the case of a creator god) rejects naturally the law of cause and effect, would not bring one beyond the circle of live. If one acts out of this wrong view unwholesome, one certainly does not prepare a good journey. How ever, Christianity, if practiced honestly, is not much different with the Buddhas teachings. It carries Dana (generosity), Sila (virtue) and even certain stages of Bhavana (meditation), and lacks just of panna (wisdom) to come out of the circle. As far as Atma had seen, most Christian serious practicing people have obviously more changes to accumulate paramis (perfections) and merits, as most of the Buddhists will actually do and doing. Being able to listen to the good teachings of the Buddha requires conditions and one does not lower his conditions but increase them, by simply stick to good ways, what ever the "tradition" is labeled to. Being grateful and showing gratitude, is not a wrong thing, if such are the intentions of prayers, but lesser good would be wishing, hoping, demanding... especially if one does not lead a live which would not provide such be own deeds, Mr konrad01.

Actually is disappearing rapidly, maybe another 5-10 years in countries of SEAsia, but there also in very remote areas and certain places. As every thing, conditions are made by one self and so people leave thinking or right view global, it global disappears. One would be wise to hurry and not naively that one day it will come to his hometown, that of which is disappearing in this world. Dont waste you time in trying to change the worlds current, one loses each moment if resisting under people of wrong view, if not established Dhamma yet and could fall down (not having entered the stream) There is a nice short explaining of the Mangala Sutta, by Upasika Nina Van Gorkum: The Greatest Blessings. And also a good guide: Mangala Suta Uannana - Ven. K. Gunaratana Thera Such as right view in modern world, such is impossible, since it is the notion of wrong view that makes it be called "modern" (among the stream of the world). Mr. Jo Wehler may also follow a discussion between a Modern Buddhist who thinks everything is fine, and Atma some years ago: Why is it important to value and see our Conditions? 95% of what ever you find, is fare away from integrity, respect, gratitude, generosity ... there are so less people who even practice the most simple meritorious deed. And that is not only a matter of lay people but has its cause also and leaded by monks and nuns. Wrong view is very blatant. They are thinking in terms of rights and when people even meet, they meet for the sake of saving their feeding grounds, may we all be in harmony... no one would meet for sharpen his views and correct them or give ones reputation to help others out. People are delighted in becoming and use Dhamma just for gain and becoming. Nearly nowhere you would find not "we live form dana" at fist place and 95% of Dhamma is shared as a means for business. Such as "happiness through wealth" ideas and leading jubu approaches are the drive of what is modern known as Buddha Dhamma. 

If Mr/Mrs user73898 is doing meditaion seriously in one stream, its would be out of any benefit, if it is done without taking the 8 precepts. Beautification is one Sila of it. Its not proper and every fellow yogi, next to the reality would just think "Oh dear, how mindful... how serious". If you find a mediation group that has no propel with that, or does not urge Mr/Mrs., run away, all they are doing is for their livelihood and without compassion for Mr/Mrs, without any benefit. Withdraw from sensual pleasure and outwardly notions of conceit (Sila), are prerequisite of meditaion (Samadhi). Not done the raw stuff, how would you waste time in grinding the tree in the forest for getting a nice chair.

Maha-nidana Sutta: The Great Causes Discourse might help one to understand that rupa depends on nama, like nama depends on rupa, and as soon nama craves after a touch (rupa), a phenomena arises, something that is not really real but object of quarrel, Mr Jo Wehler. Has Jo Wehler given a good and complete description of the chariot or can it be rebuked? As soon as an object is delineating and not seen as it really is, with right discernment, a world comes into existence including its observer. Is there a chariot if there is no contact? Is there a formation if there is no perception (imagination, remembrance)? At least Milinda did not step into trap but got a way to unleash of it. In addition, since just got across that, by trans. MN22: SN 5.10 Vajira Sutta: Sister Vajira 

One will not get ride of suffering by simply trying to ignore or oppress. Attachment has craving as its cause and craving has ignorance as its cause. So one needs to gain insight, how things really are. To gain that, one does well to learn about the teachings of the Lord Buddha and then look for one self, if this is right, as well as to practice the way to clean the mind, so that it is able to concentrate it so that one is able to see. What ever one sees, as it really is, inconstant, stressful, subject to change, one gets, disenchanted. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world. It's not possible to escape form suffering by developing such what is called "householder-equanimity" and suffering is actually a yogis friend, which does not mean that one tutors one self, but observer it and in this way one finds a way out without simply counteract in an unwholesome way, Mr Jason. The practice start with things many estimate as child work, now most are not even able to make this there way of live, like practice generosity (giving, letting go material thing), Sila (virtue)... the whole palette of meritorious deeds. There one is confronted with all his/here raw defilement of greed, dislike, stinginess, conceit. One has to work against the defilements all the time, while observing them well. So please do not fall in the current promoted misinterpretations of non-reacting and simply developing a bunch of ignorance, calling it equanimity. Last but not least, Atma likes "How does one practice suffering?" how ever, although it most important to know it well in all its aspects, its good not to forget to develop the path out of it as well. Each noble truth has its certain task. A good place to begin, actually has been always the first step is to follow good basic talks: 

Not sure if able to follow, since the question does not provide much further explaining, but Atma could think, that it recognizes the importance that one actually has to face and investigate the circle of birth, aging, death and rebirth as a phenomena seeing within one self, which seem like never been mentioned by the Buddha, speaking of death, moment for moment (kalapa means also time of existence or life). The Commentary especially the Visuddhimagga, gives much arguments to focus on that and not keeping it different form depending co-arising. 

"I am mindful of my skandas, but that doesn't prevent other's samsaric action", such can not be, Mr/Mrs 8CK8. "What are the different ways of protecting one's practice?" Mindfulness, Mr/Mrs 8CK8. Actually this can be also a hint to improve or rethink your question, ponder a little about and investigate. If Mr/Mrs 8CK8 still thinks, that he is mindful and also understands the clinging aggregates, then he/she should read About Khemaka (Note: this answer has not been given with the agreement to be means of trade or the purpose of/for trade and/or keep people trapped and bound.

And put this things into practice. Joy and pleasure are granted, as well as much suffering at the beginning with it. (Note: this answer has not been given with the agreement to be means of trade or the purpose of/for trade and/or keep people trapped and bound. How you handle it lies in your sphere, but does not excuse the deed here either.) 

Mr. Jonas Byst√∂m might read Alagaddupama Sutta: The Water-Snake Simile especially the introduction, which gives a good overview and the "Six View-Positions" section. The seven parts soul thing is a common folk believe even is SEAsia and has Tantric roots, one could say Hindu, and has influence especially many Mahayana approaches. To be or not to be is no question. There is no such as any self-theory to be found in Dhamma since it has simply the liberation form suffering, so to understand its cause, as objective and aim. Do not waste your time with such, 99% of beings do so. (Note: this answer has not been given with the agreement to be means of trade or the purpose of/for trade and/or keep people trapped and bound.

Since it seems that Mr Marcos Valle wishes and beg form somebody, its good that he/she/they understand you wishes, speak this languages. As for Mr. Marcos Valle it would be good to know what he wishes for, given that they will fulfill simply what he requests. :-) not easy, especially the fist one. As for chants (repeating what other said, or what one likes to say), they are not well put, if sung. It could district not only your mind but also the listener and they could argue about it or fall even in love with it. (for some ideas about it, see "Teaching Dhamma" in Respect-BMC2) Its quite ok and good, to use the own language, especially if one does not know the meaning. And you are explicit allowed to do so even with the Buddhas teachings, by the Buddha, to do so. (see also BMC2 which give a good reasoning) So no worry, but keep them correct in their meaning and be clear about it. Many Monks today would chant in two languages, so that the listener understands. There are no such as simply chants, which are actually not teachings. So one does not have benefit form simply hearing a pleasant sound. But to get and share the meaning, or reflect on it while doing. Chanting generally is primarily done to do not forget and preserve the teachings for later generations and others to listen. If your language is English, there are many pali chants in two languages in audio and here also as text.

No need to carry anything with you. Discard this fear and clinging, Mr/Mrs is able to remember that, and then there is all way to simply stay with that. (Note: this answer has not been given with the agreement to be means of trade or the purpose of/for trade and/or keep people trapped and bound.

Where ever you are, work on your future conditions. Is the very nature of merits that it is always a matter for giving something up to gain a better and it is natural that one leaves, step by step. Such as a society where right view is still something which has a general value, does not even exists among monastics in an amount that it would be sense-able at large. And Atma did not come across even one monk or nun in the modern world who has even basics right view on even an worldly level. Today people are feeding on the heritage of the three jewels, nothing else, and use it for a livelihood and to even to explain has become a merely useless thing, like people of old had realized the fact of the darkness in this world: Living in the World with Dhamma There is no other way as to give and letting go to develop ones own conditions for future conditions, right here and now.
