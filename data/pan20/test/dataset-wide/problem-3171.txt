To elaborate a bit on climenole's answer I'll add a bit of math behind the swastika symbol. Swastika in both clockwise and counterclockwise direction has been, and still is used in many cultures. In some areas of modern India it remains to this day as one of the symbols used to decorate the bride during wedding. The logic behind that symbol is actually straightforward: swastika is rotationally symmetric but not mirror symmetric. It kind of rolls in one direction, if you take the legs as directions, but not the other direction. Consider, for example, a square. You can rotate it as well, but there is nothing to indicate a preferred direction of rotation. Mathematicians would say that a square has symmetry group $D_8$, which includes both 90-degree rotations, as well as mirror symmetry, which postulates that it's impossible to make any convention for the preferred rotation direction. Swastika, on the other hand, has symmetry group $Z_4$, which allows to establish a convention for the preferred direction (such as "where the legs point to", for example) Since ancient times peoples half the World apart have noticed this asymmetrically symmetric feature of 3- and 4-leg swastikas and used those symbols to indicate unidirectional movements, such as "going only forward, never backward". Therefore the symbol could appear quite independently in various cultures. 

There were actually two mosques built within the Parthenon, the first was mostly destroyed when the explosion took place in 1687. The second mosque, which you are referring to is discussed in The Parthenon: From Antiquity to the Present, by Jenifer Neils. On page 324 it is stated that the small mosque had been damaged in sieges in 1821, 1826, and was finally 

Now we can compare this size to that of the ships most often thought of when we think Spanish fleet, the Galleon 

I can' speak to the individual (see update at bottom of answer) you are referring to, but the practice of banks paying interest on deposits predates his birth date of 1869. An example illustrating this from a publication by the state of Indiana in 1836: 

From this website $URL$ , in a section concerning historical clothing it goes into length on several styles of headgear. This style falls under the designation 'tiara'. 

This implies that the Western Roman Empire itself had very limited use of concrete, for its last 100 years or so, and the Temple of Minerva in 325 may have been the last major concrete construction. (which agrees with the date of 330 in comments by @LangLangC). Again 'the disintegrating central organization and shrinking building industry' would agree with 'socio-economic' issues making the use of concrete impractical. 

I agree with @jwenting's answer, although would put more emphasis on the "put that process to good use" paragraph: for a few medieval invading armies the impending suffering of civilians was the main threat in pre-war negotiations. It was the modus operandi for most Mongols' strikes: they would approach a city, demand it to surrender w/out a fight and pay tribute, or face complete destruction. The threat of what would we now call "total war" was enough for most cities to lay their arms before a single arrow was fired. The cities who wouldn't do that were suffer the worst pillage and intentional destruction by fire. Think of a school bully. What's more logical to him if somebody refuses to surrender his lunch money: bit him up or let him be because he's "just a civilian"? 

OK, OK, the above conversation is fictional. However, there is sufficient historical evidence that Romans were indeed accusing Christians of stealing babies and drinking their blood. Tertullian, an early Christian author, defended Christians against blood libel in 3rd century AD. Somewhat later, when Rome turned Christian, the folk tales about Christians had to be quelled, and the blood libel was redirected at Jews. The tales of foreign people speaking strange language and living amongst "us" and stealing babies persisted, although it never had anything to do with reality. And when Roma people came to Europe they fit the folk tale stereotype just as well as Jews. And to this day there are plenty of idiots in many European countries who propagate the libel, directed to either Romani or Jews. 

Well, I found a fairly good description of the Medieval Farming Year, and it does not support a 'spring harvest' as you suspected. From the above source, Concerning winter crops specifically in April: 

After all, free cut stone for the taking! (This is common everywhere there were ruins, of course, from the Andes to the Pyramids, and to Rome herself during the empire days) 

This would indicate that a slave would have to be of such a status that they may have had (or been given) the required fee to make use of the 'public' baths. 

So it seems references to Romans not eating three meals a day may be referring to the earlier Republic times, but later the breakfast was definitely part of the schedule. 

I believe the CS Oval buckles existed, but the number found may be extremely low, as they were not actual issued gear as with the Union buckles. From the Hanover Brass website: 

If you replace "literacy" with "access to information" you find that many governments were and are doing that to varying extent. The prime example today is North Korea that controls its people in part by controlling information. Another modern example is Russia that recently assumed government control over media that let it disseminate enough disinformation about the current events to gain 85% support for an array of heinous acts that only a couple years ago would be unthinkable. Something similar happened in many countries in 20th century: Orwellian control over information in lieu of control over literacy. 

IMHO availability of cheap slave labour made mechanization unnecessary and scarcity of educated mechanics would make attempts of automation prohibitively expensive. We can see that not only in ancient times but also well into modern age in the places or industries where manual labour was much cheaper than the cost of automation and that stalled development of applicable machinery. 

It's being presumed in a few Q&A and discussions here that democracy is the most optimal political system. I'd like to see whether this assertion can be substantiated or refuted here. Are their historical trends in the circumstances that would favour one system over another for economic performance? For example, it has been argued that Soviets defeated Germany in the fields of WWII, something that French or British couldn't do until 1944, because Stalin's violent dictatorship led to single-minded mobilization of all resources. On the other hand, in the times of plenty the opportunities for diverse free enterprise implied by democracy would lead to better economic performance in a democratic society. I'm looking for trends such as above: historically, under what circumstances would a tight oligarchy tend to outperform, and under what circumstances a democracy would? Notice that I'm not asking for opinions such as "which system is better". I'm looking for measurable performance - such as the health of economy in the times of piece or prevailing in the times of war. 

The lack of pozzolana is also mentioned in a discussion of the transition from concrete to brick structures on page 97 of the 2014 book Earthen Architecture: Past, Present and Future 

No. You can read some on the Maryland Toleration Act in the wiki article, but it basically was for Christians, whether Protestant or Catholic, Anglican, Puritan or Quaker. 

The buildings you show seem to match the dovecote, specifically the 'urban' design. So if they weren't harvesting the pigeon, it may have been a convenient method of obtaining hard to get, free fertilizer in city areas for gardens. 

Other nations which were less involved in WWI but more involved in the pandemic may be able to provide you with an idea of how a population recovers after losing a more gender balanced population percentage. This historical demographics page lists the 1907 population of the United Kingdom as 39,700,000 which means the WWI deaths accounted for about 1.76% of the population. An abstract for a study, Mortality burden of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in Europe gives an estimate of 1.1% of the European population, so percentages are similar to the losses suffered by Great Britain due to the war, and may be applicable to your query. 

There were quite a few much heavier constructions that have in fact been build and moved by manpower. Helepolis was probably the biggest one, estimated 160 tons, and it was build and moved and used as intended in the siege of Rhodes. If the speed is not an issue one can move very heavy things with pure manpower. Archimedes famously used pulleys to move a ship single-handedly. And most modern drivers, who are much weaker than 15th century soldiers, are perfectly capable of pushing a 2-ton car that wouldn't start. Leonardo's tank was a viable design IMO (apart from intentional trivial errors such as reverse direction of some screws). Since the tank didn't have to protect against 20th century artillery its armour could have been much lighter than in modern tanks. Since the goal was to get the crew to the destination through enemy fire at any speed rather than hurry their full throttle there was no expectation of high speed. A dozen or so man were perfectly capable of pushing a wheeled contraption under 20-ish tons. 

Trying to validate a fictional character is often difficult, best done usually by trying to get the authors opinion directly. In this case I think it highly unlikely, however. This page on the continuation of the T4 program, Action 14f13, in later years shows that the labor shortage was of prime concern (emphasis mine). 

There was definitely a boost in the economy, as war requires and consumes tremendous material production, which can be seen looking at the USGDP numbers for this period. Note the stagnant years before the war, but production increased steadily after: 

which basically repeat the same info, that the quote was about computers she was observing at a demonstration. 

So there were at least two uses for the word. One, when added to a name to indicate the individual deserved the highest respect, and the second, indicating the highest position possible of general military commander. 

I do not find any direct author quotes concerning the John Carter character creation, which would fully answer the question, but there is an interesting connection between Edgar Rice Burroughs(ERB) and Mosby. An entry on the civil war discussion forum CivilWarTalk talks of an encounter that George T Burroughs, father of ERB, had during the civil war. This encounter was recorded by Mary Burroughs in MEMOIRS OF A WAR BRIDE and details George Burroughs 'night ride' with a disguised Mosby who was apparently scouting for a raid. The volume wasn't widely published, but just held mainly within the family. It does, however, give a direct family connection between ERB and Mosby. The character of John Carter shows other aspects, however, which can also be attributed to Burroughs himself. He was himself a cavalryman: 

Well, "Holy Roman Empire of German People" is a long name that includes the intended form of government. This is probably not the oldest name like that though. 

"Anthropocentrism" is a bit more than portraying humans in art: it's considering humans central to Life and Universe, to the point of believing that Universe was created with humans in mind. From that point of view Medieval times were pretty much anthropocentric, with Earth located in the centre of the Universe that was created by a human-looking God that cared so much about the actions of representative of human species, which were distinctly higher than other species. 

As pointed out in the comments, the question is too broad in time span. For some parts of history there is additional ambiguity regarding which Hebrews you are talking about: at certain point in history Hebrew states of Israel and Judea were in conflict, and Israel made an alliance with Egypt to invade Judea. Does it make Egypt a Hebrews' ally (as seen by Israelites) or an enemy (as seen by Judeans)? Going even further back in time, there's still a problem of identity of Hebrews among other peoples prior to 14th-ish century BC, apart from Biblical accounts. The relations between Egypt and Hebrew state(s) varied significantly over the centuries, as did relations between any two neighbouring nations. One thing I'd like to address is the word "friends" in your answer. It's very rare for any two nations be "friends". Allies - yes; trade partners - yes; friends - hardly ever. As Churchill once said, "England has no friends, England has interests". And, as interests change, so do the alliances. 

For a completely subjective answer to a completely subjective question, a quick google on the meaning of white: 

This population of Russians were part of the Russian American Company, which was mainly invested in gathering furs. The treaty of the transfer allowed for any Russian who wished to remain to to so. From History of Alaska by Bancroft: 

Beside Culper, you may be thinking of the Clark Ring in Philadelphia, and the Mersereau Ring of Staten Island, both of which are mentioned on page 4 of Covert operations and the emergence of the modern American presidency, 1920-1960 by John J Carter 

This book, The Papers of Woodrow Wilson, vol 53 in a footnote on page 308 states that on Dec 3, the resolution (S Con Res. 26) was introduced by Senator Sherman to declare the office of President as vacant. So you have another source, with date and resolution number. All I find is a snippet view so can't give you much more.
