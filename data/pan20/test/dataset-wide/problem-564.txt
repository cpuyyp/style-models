Looks to me like the tire's been run flat. If not that then I'd say the tire's defective -- that the factory left out a layer of cord or some such. What pressure have you been running (and how much do you weigh)? 

The old traditional scheme for sizing a road frame was "standover height". You'd stand with your feet flat on the ground, straddling the bike. If you had "comfortable" (for a male) clearance of the (traditionally-positioned) top tube then the bike was the right size. I've found in practice that this scheme maybe leads one to select a bike that is slightly too large, but it's a good first approximation. Of course, these days many bikes are not traditional diamond frames, so you kind of have to extrapolate to apply the technique. And there are other aspects of fit, such as "reach", that usually follow overall fit, but not always. 

A multitool basically only needs to include the Allen wrenches that fit your bike, plus screwdrivers to fit screws on the bike. It doesn't hurt if the tool purports to include a tire lever, but I wouldn't rely on one in a multitool to be any good -- you should carry regular levers or a Quick Stick if you intend to be prepared to repair a tire. 

Rather than targeting a C (which I assume means you want to participate in a race and be "competitive"), maybe you should consider touring instead. Slower paced, non-competitive, emphasizes simply enjoying the ride. Can be day trips or weeks long, road or trail, self-contained or supported, alone or in a group. 

That appears to be a standard flip-up chuck, and it claims to be "universal". If using on a Schrader valve you just push it on and flip up the lever. If using on a Presta valve you unscrew the knob on the Presta valve first, then push on and flip up the lever. With some of these you need to not push the chuck quite all the way on if using on Schrader. On the other hand, if the tube is fully deflated, you may need to press the tire with your thumb to hold the valve in place (keep it from sliding back through the rim) as you press the chuck on, so that you can get the chuck on far enough to hold. (My suspicion is that this is your problem -- the valve is sliding into the rim so the chuck does not get on far enough.) If need be, you can sometimes tighten the nut around the chuck opening to achieve a tighter fit (or loosen if the fit seems too tight). 

The smallest cog appears to be rather badly worn (hard to say for sure without a shot from the side) and the second smallest is sorta worn, but otherwise the cluster doesn't appear to be very worn at all. I do note that in your shots you have the front on the granny and the rear on the small cog, meaning that your chain tension is very low. One generally should not ride in this configuration, of course, but shift to a larger ring when near the small end of the cluster. Can't tell if the hanger or derailer is bent -- it kinda seems to be in the bottom shot, but from that angle it's hard to tell. Look straight down at the derailer and cluster, and then straight on from the back, and make sure everything is parallel. (A bike shop has the tools to check this, but you can often see a lot by just looking.) 

If the problem is the bottles clanking into each other, don't put the crate in flat but somehow tilt it at a 30 degree angle or so, so that gravity holds the bottles against each other. Then wedge your towels into the high end of the crate to keep the bottles from bouncing. 

For moderate weather all you need is comfortable shorts. (Even if it seems a bit too cool out for shorts, once you get going you stay plenty warm. Lots of heat is generated in the legs when you cycle.) For a 5-mile haul gym shorts work fine, or you can get some spandex bike shorts. But bike shorts aren't really needed for such a short ride. In somewhat cooler weather I've done a fair amount of cycling with sweat pants pulled over cycle shorts or gym shorts. You do need a leg strap, of course, but you need that for most types of pants. Obviously, for seriously wet weather you need something different. I have a pair of old Performance brand rain paints for that. They can be worn alone (over shorts) or over the sweat pants. For colder weather I have some Col'd Lizard Polartec tights. I wear these over the shorts, and I'm generally good down to about 20F. I also sometimes wear the tights when I'm operating the snow blower -- snow doesn't stick to them. 

Simply wipe the bike off with a rag, or disposable paper towels, taking care to give the chain a wipe (but not overdoing it). There is no need to wash the bike or get it perfectly clean. 

I no longer cycle 12 months/year, limiting my cycling to weather that's reasonably comfortable with nothing heavier than a light long-sleeve jersey and lightweight tights (possibly augmented by a "sauna suit" when it seems a better option to get wet from the inside rather than the outside). Socks are always Coolmax. Glove liners under my fingerless cycling gloves in cooler weather. Most of the time I just wear a lightweight cotton tee shirt and standard "spandex" cycling shorts. I used to cycle in jogging shorts but decided as I got older I needed a bit better padding. Back when I was cycling in the winter I'd use, depending on the temp, Goretex jacket and pants, long underwear (standard Sears issue), windproof undershorts, heavier Coolmax socks, rubber booties. Ski mittens over glove liners on my hands. Never could find a balaclava that fit my beard and I don't do scarves, so the face was always a problem. (This is Minnesota, with most of the cycling being back and forth to work 10-25 miles one way on country roads.) [I'll add that I never quite got into the ice bike thing -- didn't use studs and could only cycle on days that the roads were clear.] 

There are various extension mounts you can buy or build to reposition lights and other handlebar-mount items. I have a purchased unit that can be adjusted maybe 2" higher than the bar, and which can mount on either the bar or the stem. You can also craft something with a short piece of plastic pipe, a few screws and brackets, and some cleverness. 

There are lots of different views on how to train, but you've got plenty of time, so there's no need to find the "optimal" scheme -- you just want what works for you. I would encourage you to get out on the road as soon as you can (dunno what your weather issues might be). A trainer does not have enough of a varying load/pace (even if it's programmable) to really challenge your muscles, plus it's incredibly boring. And you need to build up your time/distance -- not all at once, but by September you should be doing moderately paced 4-hour rides maybe every two weeks. You don't need to train for the full 120km, but should be able to do maybe 80km without incredible discomfort. On "race" day you can let adrenaline carry you the last 40km. 

The bike has individual cartridge bearings -- not at all standard for a "real" bike, and a bit unusual for even an exercise bike. (In fact, though I've seen a half-dozen different types of exercise bikes taken apart I've never seen anything like this.) But it's not a terribly complicated setup. The C-clips hold the axle in place. The ring against which the C-clips ride is the inner race of the bearing and rotates with the axle. If you can find a bushing (washer) of a suitable diameter and thickness it can be inserted between the C-clip and the bearing -- fairly easily accomplished by someone with moderate mechanical abilities. You should only need the bushing on one side. The one thing to be wary of is to get the crank arm back on tight, as a loose crank arm quickly destroys the mating surfaces. A well-equipped hardware store should have a selection of bushings (and some spare C-clips, should the one on there be damaged or go flying across the room). (There is also an old mechanic's trick: You could work some coarse string into the gap, twisting it around the axle several times. It should stay in place fairly well, without anything to secure it, especially if you dab on a little grease or petrolatum.) 

With any bike the most important thing is "fit" -- is the bike too tall, too short, too much "reach", too little? For a bike to have a good basic fit you should be able to stand over it flat-footed and have "comfortable" clearance at the crotch. For bikes with lower than normal top bars (eg, many mountain bikes), you should pick a bike that would be comfortable even with the top bar at the "normal" height. And for "real" off-roading you want more actual crotch clearance than for more normal riding. But too much crotch clearance is a signal that the bike may be too small for you. The bike should also be tall enough that you can raise the seat high enough to have your legs nearly completely extended at the bottom of your pedal stroke. When riding, the "reach" should be comfortable for your style of riding. For casual riding you want a shorter reach and more upright posture than for racing or aggressive off-roading. However, for really tall, long-torso people a "casual" reach can be too short for even casual riding, forcing the rider to curl his torso too much, and short people, on the other hand, may have to use a bike that's a hair smaller than ideal to get the most comfortable reach. When you ride it is it stable (but is it also responsive -- there's a trade-off). And obviously you want a bike that suits your needs -- multispeed or not? "Road" vs "mountain"? Upright or "aero"? Can carry a load with a rack, or is stripped-down for lightness and speed? Checking the bike over: Everything should be parallel (except, perhaps, the chain on a derailleur bike). Stand straddling the front wheel looking toward the back of the bike. With the front wheel centered you should be able to look down and see the tire "disappear" under the frame tubes, with it not peeking out more on one side vs the other (which would indicate a warped frame). Similarly, the front and rear wheels should be exactly in line, not one more to one side than the other. Look at the derailer. When the arm of the derailer is moved it should stay parallel to the wheel. Look at the chainrings. When the crank is turned, the chainrings shouldn't wobble. Standing over the top bar, grip the rear brakes and move the bike forward and back. There will be some "spring" in rim brakes, but there should be no "rattle" sensation. Do the same with the front, only also feel for any looseness in the headset bearings. There should be no detectable looseness in the headset. Off the bike (and preferably with the bike upside down or suspended in a stand) shake the wheels, feeling for any looseness in the wheel bearings. Likewise shake the crank. And, obviously, check for serious rust, things that are seriously dinged, scratched, etc. A few scratches on a well-used steel frame is not a reason to reject the bike, though (unless you're looking for a "perfect" specimen). 

Are you sure you're putting in the right number of balls? Generally, when a bearing is new there is about a half-ball space left when you have a full complement of balls. As the bearing wears this gets to be closer to a full ball's space. It's easy to see the space and think you should put in another ball, but you don't need one. (To hold the balls in place, of course, dab some grease into the race. Place the balls in the grease, and install the greased cone. This makes it fairly easy to reassemble a hub.) 

What you most likely have is an old-fashioned coaster brake, along with a hand brake. In reality the coaster brake is probably more "natural" for someone learning -- the hand brake is mostly an affectation designed to make the bike appeal more to boys (of all ages). But it is possible to disassemble the rear hub and disable the brake in most cases. There are 3-4 different mechanisms used, so it's impossible to give you detailed instructions, but it would be apparent to anyone with sufficient mechanical aptitude. (But note that the rear hub, in addition to being very greasy inside, contains lots of little parts, and reassembly requires some skill.) 

Note that proper detective work would identify the cause of this fairly easily. Sometimes it's not possible when you get a flat in the rain at night on the side of the road, but in slightly more convenient conditions you should always take a few minutes for a proper post-mortem examination. This starts before you even take the tire off. Ideally, use a grease pencil or piece of chalk or some such to mark the valve position on the outside of the tire, and also identify the left vs right side of the tire (and similarly keep track of left vs right side of the rim). Remove the tube from the wheel (it's not always necessary to completely dismount the tire), mark the tube to identify left vs right side, just as you did with the tire, and inflate the tube to find the leak. When you find the leak, observe where it is!! A hole on the inside diameter of the tube, where the tube is sitting adjacent to the spoke nipples, almost always results from a spoke poking through, or a defective rim strip which allows the sharp edges of the nipple to "worry" a hole into the tube. A hole on the side, near where the edge of the rim would be, suggests a rough edge on the rim, a bit of wire poking out from the tire bead, or "snake bite" due to the tube getting squeezed between tire and rim when you hit a curb or other large obstruction. Note that "snake bite" will often, though not always, result in two cuts in the tube, maybe a half-inch apart (hence the name "snake bite"). A hole on the outer diameter of the tube, under the tread of the tire, suggests a "normal" puncture. But having found the hole in the tube, you've only completed half of the investigation. Lay the wheel flat, lay the tire on (if it's been dismounted), and the tube on the tire. Use the marks you made earlier to position the tube and tire in their original orientations relative to each other and the wheel. Observe again where the hole is (you marked it, right?) and check the same location on the tire and/or rim for any sort of foreign object or defect. This could be a bit of glass in the tire, a piece of wire, a large hole in the tire (needing a "boot"), a sharp edge on something, etc. Check both by sight and using your hand to feel -- sometimes you can see a defect you can't feel, and sometimes the defect can be felt but not easily seen. Also feel around in the tire generally for a loose fragment of glass or some such. Sometimes a fragment gets in there and moves around. About the only problem this procedure won't identify is damage from improper installation. Such damage is usually along the sides, and may have the appearance of a cut vs a pin-style puncture. But such damage usually is the result of using screwdrivers or metal "spoons" to service the tire, vs plastic "spoons" or a Quick Stick. 

Front and rear derailers are essentially independent -- so long as the two derailers can function with the same type chain they can work together. Derailer "fit" basically involves 4 factors: 

Replacing a hub is not a "simple" procedure -- it, at a minimum, involves relacing the rear wheel, probably with different sized spokes (whose size you must accurately determine). Relacing is not beyond the abilities of a competent backyard mechanic, but is a skill that needs to be learned. To add a second chainring you must install some sort of device to take up the chain slack. A front derailer does not do this, so either a rear derailer or some specialized device. It would be far easier/cheaper to purchase a new (or "new to you" used) bike. What you MIGHT be able to do is to replace your front chainring with a smaller one. Or it's vaguely possible that there is available a replacement larger sprocket for your rear hub. Of course, either of these would slow down your high gear.
