I do not think you can do anything specific to control sweat rate, rather you can learn to deal with it. Having trained for Ironman, I know what you are talking about. The logistics of the amount of water and salt on long training days gets ridiculous. My first Ironman, I drank 18 litres on the bike, and 8 litres on the run (it was a hot day) and I still lost 9 lbs. That is like 50+ lbs of water sweat out. The electrolytes matter as each litre of sweat can contain 1-1.5g of salt. That is a LOT of salt to recover. As you get more fit and your body accommodates to the hot weather through training in it, your sweat should get a little more dilute which helps. 

Building base is hard. Everything depends upon the base. Getting a base going is hard, and often involves injury. Once you get past that, people often (always exceptions, there are no hard and fast rule) start getting a different class of injuries, usually due to overwork or imbalances that show up at higher intensities. So you need to do as much as you can without getting injured, and slowly increase. That old 10% rule. Your injuries might be due to biomechanical issues. Proper shoe selection might help. Orthotics may help. Strengthening excersizes to overcome muscle imbalances may help. But there is no silver bullet, other than to proceed cautiously. Do not try and run through something that hurts, consider it, and make a wise choice if it something you can run through or not. As a side note, this is why you NEVER want to stop running for several months! You lose most of your base and have to start again. That sucks. A lot. 

In general, run training takes several forms, often considered as Strength and Endurance. Strength This can be accomplished with building running specific muscles, usually by hard running. Hill Training You run up a hill, pushing hard, to build the muscles you use when running up a hill. Speed Work This is often done on a track, running repeats of a specific distance. 100, 200, 400, 800 meter repeats. (Outdoor tracks are very often 400m or 440 yards in length. So 200m is half a lap, 800m is two laps). The problem for you, is that 2 miles at a time is not quite enough of a base of running to really start in on these training methods since you almost certainly will get injured due to lack of fitness. Endurance This can be thought of as people training for longer distance runs, like a half marathon (13.1m/21.1k), marathon (26.2m/42.2k) or even longer. I suspect, if your base is 2 miles at a time, you need to focus on endurance first. Sadly the basic way to do it, is simple and almost tautological. To run longer, run longer. That is, if you can do 2 miles a day, then try one day to run 2.5 miles, while keeping the other days at 2 miles. Then keep increasing one or two days a week. (Space the longer days out as far apart as you can to allow for recovery, since the harder workout breaks down muscle, and it grows back stronger, which is how you get stronger, but all that takes time to happen. So recovery is key). 

My experience with hyponatremia comes from Ironman racing and training. The thing I had to learn to do was to get enough salt into me. Sports drinks have no where near enough, compared to the rate I sweat at. I am at the high end of the range, 1.5L/hr or more. (Measure dry before, go out for 10 hours, track fluid in, rarely end up peeing, weigh after, 1Kilo=1Litre). 1L of sweat has on the order of 1-2 grams of salt. My issue turned out to be that during the swim, (I am slow, so 1:30 or so) I would sweat so much, but not notice since I was swimming that when I started the bike, I was already down on salt and it just got worse. I started simply eating salt packets from a restaurant evey 1-2 hours. Not too much at any one time, easy to get down, easy to come by, made a huge difference. But hyponatremia does really suck. I find it makes me fall asleep, even while riding, which is usually my first indication I screwed up. Within moments of the salt touching my tongue, I start to feel better. It is amazingly fast. The upside is you get to pass out in odd locations, without the use of alcohol! I stopped once 4 hours into a 7 hour ride at 35C, to buy some water and chips. Sat in the shade to eat and drink and passed out. When I woke up and came into the store again they were relieved, as they were planning on calling an ambulance soon. 

Start with biking, even on a stationary. Get used to the movements of your legs. This helps build muscles and strengthens your knees, before you start taking the pounding on them for real. If riding a real bike work on seated climbs. (Same on a spinning bike I suppose, but more fun outdoors. Once you start running, listen to your body, as others have suggested, but also try working on a Run:Walk program. There are many approaches to this. This can be a run 10 minutes walk 1, once you get better at it. But start with run 1 minute, walk 1 minute, and repeat for all the time you have set aside for your run. Then as that gets more comfortable, switch to two minutes running, one minute walking. If you are worried about your joints, consider starting out on a running track, since they make it out of much softer, bouncy material instead of pavement or concrete. 

As you note, the 500K notion is just a rule of thumb. I am a pretty big guy (250+ pounds) and my shoes wear out much faster than 500K. I am lucky if I get 300K out of a pair. You can see the crushed and worn out sole (Of course some of that is my goofy running stride, leading to strange wear patterns). So sole wear depth is another hint. As the sole wears out, you can assume the cushioning has gone with it as well. Usually, if you compare a fresh pair, with a used pair, you can see how much the cushioning at the edges, has shrunken. 

I do not know optimals, since I keep hearing different theories and numbers changing over the years. The good news is that detecting 65% or higher is pretty simple. When you can start hearing yourself breathe, your heart rate is over 65%. When you can no longer hold a conversation with someone you are above 85%, so basically stay in a range where you are breathing hard, but can talk, and you are pretty close to being within that fat burning range, and no HRM or widgets required. 

I found running after work, but before dinner very effective for years. If I waited too long, or ate dinner first, it was much harder to run. So consider running first thing, after your night shift ends? See if that helps. 

Everyone has to start somewhere. You will very quickly find out how far you can go. Do not try and keep up with the class, but do work on keeping your legs moving as long as you can. I.e. Do the best you can, considering the circumstances. You will get better with practice, and have patience. One of the things the instructor will do is suggest tension levels on the brake. Keep your tension easier so you can make it as far through the session as you can. 

I personally prefer NOT to use a flotation device, but I am kind of fluffy, and prefer to turn my hands horizontal and use them to generate lift, more than to generate forward motion. There are many different waist or upper body styles. You should mostly use the regular running motion, it cannot be identical, but the goal is to keep it the same, as best as possible. A little more leaning forward though, as is required to make forward motion. You should NOT be touching the bottom of the pool. Your goal is to avoid impact (depending on WHY you are water running) although if impact is not an issue, you can if you like. You do need to make forward progress, be it ever so painfully slow. My advice is to find a friend to do this with so you can chat. It is mind numbingly boring, and difficult to work as hard as regular running. You can also try sprints in the water for variety. 

Immediately after (like within 30 minutes or sooner) dump a bunch of protein into your system. I like chocolate milk, but anything with protein and carbs and fluid is good. This helps your body recover faster as it starts off will all the raw materials it needs. If you can handle it, a cold bath (ice cold is optimum, but very hard to take) can help reduce any immediate swelling. Advil is quite good for muscle pain, once you have had some time to rehydrate, since it can reduce kidney function. Other than that, suck it up. :) Alas, this is the side affect of building muscle. It hurts. I wish there was a magic bullet to fix it. 

If your stopwatch allows review, and you have enough laps, what you do is start when you are ready for your first sprint. Run it out. Lap. Then however long your rest period, let it run until you are ready for your second sprint, and then lap again to start. When your second sprint is done, lap again. And repeat. Upon review, you will have your obvious two and half minute sprints, and some longer intervals for the rest. Or even if they are similar in time, the ordering will tell which is which, so you will know the sprint times. I do this on hills. Start during warm up, lap at base of first hill, lap at top. Lap at the bottom to measure descent, lap after cool down period and start of second hill, repeat. It helps I use a Timex Datalink USB which has a 200 lap stop watch, and downloads over USB to an Excel sheet. (Alas they stopped making them. Best watch ever!) Holy spimoney! That Amazon link is $250? I paid between 50 and 70 over the years. (I bought three as I broke/lost them). 

Glide phase is important. So on each stroke, you want to hold it for a minimal amount of time to enjoy the benefit of the glide. I was taught to bring your arm forward, stretch out, for maximum length, hold that hand forward for a pause, then bring the other arm back, holding that one forward. Same on breast stroke, you need to hold the glide for a moment. (I cannot define the length of that moment). 

There are two interesting physiological markers for exertion that can be very helpful. When you start hearing yourself breathe (likely what you call panting, but probably a bit earlier) you have passed about 60% Heart Rate. This is useful, since you want to be running harder than 60%. When you can no longer talk, you are closer to 85% which is needed for harder workouts, but on longer slow runs, you want to avoid. So it is possible, if you are just getting started, and finding that breathing is consuming you, that it is a matter of taking it a bit easier, until you get your base fitness built and are more efficient. It does take some time, and the best way to get there faster is just keep running. 

If you have access to a pool, water running can be pretty effective. Find a pool that is deep enough for you to not touch the bottom, and with a floaty belt (or not, I prefer not), pretend to run, without touching. The key is not to touch the bottom and possibly hurt your toe. I.e. Make the running motion, arms and legs, through the water. Assuming your toe can take the waters resistance. You can focus on the muscles used for running and form, (Easier to focus on form with a floaty belt, but better workout without it) but you lose the benefit of impact (which the toe is obviating anyway. I have found this fairly effective, when injured, that disallows impact on joints. 

Look at the schedule of the kind of running they are alternating through and find one they do not do enough. From your list, Tempo runs as an example. Also try to arrange something social after like drinks, coffee, or just dinner. 

In general it is thought that your body takes three approaches to energy sources while exersizing. If your percent heart rate (HR) is below 80% usually people will be burning fat. If your HR gets higher, your body will switch to using glycogen for fuel, since it can be processed faster. Eventually you can burn muscle, but that is usually pretty extreme. I too find an ammonia like smell, and have just accepted it is the cost of distance running.
