As you notice, it looks like there will always be a way for things to fall apart; and that's why Plato says they always will fall apart, eventually. There may be different implementations of The Republic's model, but they will never been incorruptible. One note: you suggest two "opposing" sets of guardians, but I think it helps to see Plato's guardians as autonomous agents, each on their own. Thus the single group of guardians already is many different "opposing" people keeping themselves and each other in check. 

Thus, Buddhism did not have anything to do with the idea of zero, but rather it was Hinduism that allowed for its acceptance (note "acceptance," and definitely not "invention" - zero existed long before even Hinduism became prominent, as it was used as a placeholder since Babylonian times). The Indian concept of the void, arising from Hinduism, helped usher in the Arabic numeral system and eventual mathematical applications of zero. For further information, I strongly recommend Zero as I mentioned above. 

Which is essentially the base of the logic being used. But even if one accepts this, one must then accept: 

There are over six thousand living languages in the world, of which more than one thousand are defined as "endangered" - they are at serious risk of becoming extinct, with no living speakers. Rather more surprising, it is estimated that more than half of all these languages will be extinct by the next century. Naturally there are numerous efforts initiated in response to this, generally trying to record endangered languages and revitalize their use within native communities. Now, my question is whether from a philosophical perspective there is any reason (ethical, epistemic, etc.) to save these languages. On the one hand, there are arguments for preservation of culture and diversity (though these beg the question of why this sort of preservation is desirable), and such arguments can maybe even be thought of as espousing epistemic value of languages in and of themselves. On the other hand, linguistic homogeneity might be considered a desirable goal for utilitarian purposes - if everyone understood each other things might be a lot easier. There are probably dozens of other factors to be considered as well; this obviously does not begin to scratch the surface. So what are the important considerations here? What arguments can be posed for or against working to save endangered languages? Maybe more radically, are there any arguments for active effort toward destruction of languages? Or perhaps constant construction of novel languages? 

Given that you haven't specified much in your question, I'm going to have to make some assumptions in this answer. Let us assume that: 

This is the crucial statement that your question is asking (when reduced to the relevant premises). As presented, the answer is intuitively no: God necessarily being eternal, he cannot cease to exist. However, this implies that he is not omnipotent, and so your question is a variation of: The Omnipotence Paradox The omnipotence paradox, in short, is this: 

Schopenhauer is a figure who comes to mind here: he's not only advocated the related position of anti-natalism but also argued that suicide is a right of any human being, the opposite of immoral. By his argument suicide can actually be the most magnificent declaration of moral freedom, as it constitutes taking maximal control of one's life. This sort of thinking that it is an inviolable part of one's agency to end one's own existence is far from unheard of; the idea is that suicide can't be inherently immoral because it is among the most basic rights of any living agent to die. Some existentialism takes this to an extreme, according to which the default position is more or less that we should commit suicide unless we're able to find something worth living for. To spin this into an explicitly moral argument (which has been done in exactly this way), suppose straightforwardly that happiness is the good, and that there exists a person nobody knows about who is doomed to suffer for the rest of their life and knows this. Under such a circumstance suicide becomes rational. Less contrived examples come up in the real world and have been the subject of many debates. 

That is, each animal is itself one object, and then the two of them together is a distinct third object. This seems in tune with how "a white horse isn't a horse." The sentence itself plays out like so: A brown horse (1) and a dark ox (2) are three together [brown horse + dark ox] (3). Of course, as I said this is only my own interpretation and I have no references save for the similarity this reasoning bears to that used for your second example. 

The key to our being immune to paradoxes is that we recognize and abandon them. Therefore, so long as we can program artificial intelligence to recognize when something is a paradox, the AI should not have difficulty with paradoxes. The first time someone considers "this statement is false", they'll eventually come to the conclusion that it's a paradox; then they will stop trying "true then false then true then false..." So, as long as a computer can do the same, it really won't have issue with paradoxes. 

I think the sticking point here is, as you point out, the immediateness of qualia. But that's not actually taken for granted in the literature. In the physicalism vs. anti-materialism debate in philosophy of mind, there's a proposal called the Qualitative Inaccuracy Hypothesis (QI), essentially that we are mistaken about our own qualia (for example, we're wrong about how we represent our experience of "red" when we see an apple). This is a pretty robust position (I was swayed despite vehement resistance at first), though it's admittedly abstract. In brief, the hypothesis relies in most incarnations on a non-immediacy of qualia. That is, consider that whenever we form beliefs about our qualia, we undergo an introspective process: we have to introspect to decide what it is we're feeling. The skeptic about our qualia-beliefs suggests that this introspective faculty can, in some instances, be wrong. Here's a rough (and not entirely successful, I know) example attributed by Christopher Hill in Sensations: A Defense of Type Materialism to a seminar of Rogers Albritton's: 

If you think you'll manage reading Nietzsche himself, I would certainly recommend it - it'll give you a very direct image of his philosophy. I personally started with Beyond Good and Evil, and would recommend it as one of the first things you read; you will get right into Nietzsche's epistemology, his concept of will to power, and some fairly amusing attacks on other groups of thought (especially when he calls democrats sheep; I'll never forget that). However, having read On the Genealogy of Morals later on, I would caution against starting immediately with Beyond Good and Evil, and instead recommend reading at least the first essay, if not the second of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals. This is why: 

Is this argument logically sound, though? In its brevity it seems to be leaving out a plethora of other considerations that can easily make death a very fearsome thing. For example, one may fear leaving behind one's family, being forgotten without a legacy, or one may fear "nothing" itself, as "not existing" is a fairly mysterious - and therefore possibly disturbing - notion itself. Or are the former not directly related to death, and is the latter illogical? In response to one of the answers below, I thought it would be pertinent to clarify my main concern: assuming that in death there is no perception nor experience, what criticisms of Epicurus' argument remain? I appreciate the answer from the dualist perspective, but I was also hoping for something more scrutinizing of Epicurus' assertion that "if there is no experience in death, it should not be feared." Have any authors written about this? 

Cannibalism is generally frowned upon in most of today's societies1. On the other hand, it has happened quite a bit in times of difficulty, and famine aside it was simply common practice in some communities. With this in mind, and considering that even in the "civilized" world there have been cases of nonchalant cannibalism, the question arises of just what the ethical status of cannibalism is. I'm looking specifically for arguments regarding cannibalism in and of itself, separate from issues such as avoiding starvation or murder. Simply, what are the most common positions (along with their supporting reasoning) on the ethical status of consuming human flesh as a single, isolated action? What are the philosophical arguments condemning it, and what are those that condone it? 1 - I was unable to quickly find a general source for this, but if you doubt me I invite you to wander to the nearest restaurant and order man-pie. 

Which is exactly what your example is: a long set of premises about the native people, all quite believable but irrelevant to the question of what is or is not "primitive" (which is itself only an implied argument - there is no explicit logical argument in the image). The argument in the list of "without" terms is that the native people do not have many of the problems of the industrialized world; this is true, but it only allows one to reach a conclusion along the lines of: 

The history of civilization in the West (i.e. Europe) goes back many thousands of years. Since well before 1000 BC there have been people living in what is now Turkey, Greece, and even Italy, in such cities as Miletus and Troy. For much of their history, people living in the West were content with their traditional mythology and legend as explanations of the world around them. In the 7th century BC, Homer came around and developed perhaps the greatest collection of myth and legend in Western literature. However, it was just that: myth, quite unsubstantiated and irrational, though incredibly important nevertheless. But then something seemed to change. In the late 7th century BC there came a man named Thales, and he was not satisfied with the traditions of old. Instead, he developed his own theories on what the world is made of, declaring among other things that "water is the first principle" from which all things come, and that there is a single entity "God" which "shaped and created all things from water." And he wasn't the only one determined to come up with a more reasoned and physical explanation of things. Soon there came Anaximenes, Parmenides, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, all of whom had their own decidedly un-mythological theories of the world. And with that the discipline of Ancient Philosophy was born, and soon there were tens, hundreds, thousands of people who at least tried to work things out on their own. Why, though? When people had been living with myth for many centuries, why did they start to look for their own answers, independent of tradition or legend? Admittedly some of their theories were still quite absurd, but at least they generally didn't involve various gods and goddesses giving birth to the Earth and its creatures. The new theories were much more physical and separate from the gods, and they tried to break down what the world is made of, how it came to be, and how things should work in a much less divine sort of way (though God or the Mind or some other entity often played a role in cosmogony, the field that is still quite a mystery to us today). So, what led to the birth of philosophical thought as opposed to mythological tradition in the Ancient West? 

I don't know why this did not immediately come to mind, but Isaac Asimov's The Last Answer deals with precisely what you are talking about. It's a short story that you should be able to read in five minutes, but I will summarize it in brief: A physicist dies of a heart attack, and finds that his consciousness has survived this event. He is then visited by the voice of some Entity which is apparently eternal and omnipotent. The physicist has been chosen out of a select few sentient beings by the Entity to think for all eternity. The point of this is that though the Entity can know everything, it chooses to surprise itself by keeping certain knowledge from itself and creating this "research team," the members of which, once every eon, discover some novel piece of knowledge and thus give pleasure to the Entity. Here we have a God-like being that makes a purpose for itself which specifically concerns the human race. This being, though not "blissful", is certainly not too bored. 

If you are looking for modern works, I believe the contemporary author Peter Russell has written on the subject (he approaches it from a metaphysical point of view), as has Daniel Dennett, but from a materialist point of view (meaning through neuropsychology). The Phenomology of Spirit by Hegel discusses the evolution and nature of consciousness, so it may be useful for your purposes. Fichte's Foundations of Natural Right addresses the nature and origin of consciousness from a social perspective (i.e. how self-consciousness in men relates to their society). If you are interested in the implications of consciousness and its nature (although not its origin), I would strongly recommend Dostoyevsky's Notes From Underground, which reveals the nature of higher consciousness. Other potentially useful sources could be Schopenhauer and Kant (although I am not certain of the extent they discuss the topic).
