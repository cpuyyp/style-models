PS: As Andreas mentions, this isomorphism might not be particularly useful. For abelian and compact groups this is the case, but it does become useful in the general case! We often want to answer the following question: 

If $X$ is a Real Banach space with strictly convex norm, it is known that for any non-empty compact, convex set $K$ and point $x_0\notin K$, there exists a unique point $z_0\in K$ minimizing the quantity $\|z-x_0\|$ in $z\in K$. My question is whether it is known if the obvious generalization holds: 

The answer is that the reflexivity assumption cannot be dropped. The following simple example (due to Tony Wickstead) is a 1-normal non-reflexive space with closed and generating cone, where there exists a pair of elements without minimal upper bound: 

Some definitions: Let $(M,d)$, $(M',d')$ be metric spaces. For $f:M\to M'$, $x\in M$ and $r>0$, define $$D_r(f)(x):= \sup\{r^{-1}d'(f(x),f(y)): y\in M,\,d(x,y)\leq r\}.$$ Define the pointwise Lipschitz constant of $f$ at $x\in M$ as $\text{Lip}(f)(x):=\limsup_{r\to 0} D_r(f)(x)$, and say $f$ is pointwise Lipschitz at $x$, if $\text{Lip}(f)(x)<\infty$. My question is the following: 

My feeling is that this should have been investigated somewhere in the literature, but in my inexperience navigating that landscape I had thus far been unable to find it. 

Let $\alpha>0$ and $X$ be an $\alpha$-normal (meaning, for $x,y\in X$, $0\leq x\leq y$ implies $\|x\|\leq\alpha\|y\|$) ordered Banach space with closed generating cone $X_{+}$. If $X$ is reflexive, then every pair of elements from $X$ has a minimal upper bound, i.e., for $x,y\in X$, there exists some $z\in X$ with $\{x,y\}\leq z$, such that $\{x,y\}\leq w\leq z$ implies $w=z$. One can show this using Zorn's lemma and the fact that order intervals are weakly compact (since they are convex, closed and norm bounded, and the space is reflexive). 

EDIT: There's a left/right action problem, because $\beta_0(\sigma,\tau) = \sigma(\alpha_{\tau}) \alpha_{\sigma} \alpha_{\sigma \tau}^{-1}$ with what I wrote. I think it has to do with the fact that you use exponential notation, so somehow your action is on the right? Maybe you define $x^{\sigma} = \sigma^{-1}(x)$? Otherwise the definition of $\beta$ doesn't make it a 2-cocycle, with the definitions I know. Could you clarify? 

Pick a $\sigma \in \Gamma_F$ such that $\sigma |_E$ generates $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. There is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n$ such that for all $x \in \Gamma_E$, $\rho(\sigma x \sigma^{-1}) = A \rho(x) A^{-1}$, and if $q$ denotes the order of $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, we get that $\rho(\sigma^q x \sigma^{-q}) = A^q \rho(x) A^{-q}$, which by irreducibility and Schur's lemma implies that $\rho(\sigma^q) A^{-q} = \lambda \mathrm{Id}$. Choose any $\mu$ such that $\mu^q = \lambda$. Then setting $\rho(\sigma)=\mu A$ is one of the $q$ ways to extend $\rho$. 

By induction on $n$. If $n=1$, no problem. If $n \geq 2$, if the polynomials $p_{m_j}$ are all constant, still no problem. So assume $p_{m_1}$ nonconstant. Approximating $f$ is the same as approximating $t \mapsto e^{-\lambda_1 t} f(t)$, so we may assume $\lambda_1=0$. Then we approximate $f'$, using induction (since $\lambda_1=0$, $\sum_{j=1}^M (m_j+1)$ is less for $f'$). Now if $f'-u_0$ is small, with $u_0(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k e^{\mu_k t}$, then $f-u$ is also small, where $u(t)=f(0)-\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k/\mu_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{c_k}{\mu_k} e^{\mu_k t}$ (using integration). The only problem here is that maybe $\mu_k=0$ for some $k$. But we can take $\mu_k$ very small but nonzero instead, $u_0$ is still close to $f'$. This method gives an algorithm: everything is computable, and the only approximations are in fact the choices of "replacements" for zero $\mu_k$ (if you take it to be $1/n$, you get a sequence). 

Following Marc's suggestion, I'll make my comments into a more extended answer. The answer is yes. Every unitrary representation of $G$ can be "integrated" to get a representation of $C^{\ast}(G)$ and every representation of $C^{\ast}(G)$ can be "separated" to get a representation of $G$ (the terms 'integrating' and 'separating' come from the more general crossed product theory, and are the functors between the said categories). These constructions are mutual inverses and preserve a whole bunch of properties, one of which is intertwining operators, therefore the categories are isomorphic. You could take a look at Proposition 2.40 in "Crossed prducts of $C^*$-algebras" by Dana P. Williams (who does it for only equivalences) or Proposition 5.5 in this paper ($URL$ by some colleagues of mine (who do it a lot more generally, but they do specifically include the case for intertwiners which is what Sergio was asking about in the comments). One small difference is that in both these references strong instead of weak continuity of the group representation is assumed. I don't think this is too much of a problem, as long as we can pull bounded operators through integrals (however we might choose define those). But do correct me if I'm wrong! 

If $S$ is quasi-convex (meaning there exists a bi-Lipschitz bijection from $S$ to some length space), then I'm fairly sure that the answer is `yes'. I thought one could use uniform continuity of $f$ (since $M$ is assumed to be compact) to make the general case work, but one always seems to run into the same problem: For a given $\varepsilon >0$, it seems to be that one cannot necessarily find an $r_0>0$ so that, for all $0<r<r_0$ and all $s\in S$, we have $D_r(f)(s) <\alpha + \varepsilon$. So it feels like there should be a counterexample. [1] $URL$ 

You need to add some assumption, otherwise $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ add to a matrix with eigenvalues $1 \pm \sqrt{n}$. Maybe your operators are self-adjoint? 

Take $f(x)=(x+1)e^{-x}$ and $g(x)=e^x$, then $f(x)-v/g(x)=(x+1-v)e^{-x}$ and the derivative with respect to $x$ is $(v-x)e^{-x}$. 

It is also true for local rings. Let $A$ be a matrix with coefficients in $K = \mathrm{Frac}(R)$, such that $A \mathrm{GL}_n(R) A^{-1} \subset \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. Then in particular, $A (I_n + E_{i,j})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ and $A (I_n+E_{i,i}+E_{i,j}+E_{j,i})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ for all $i \neq j$, so that $a_{i,j} b_{k,l} \in R$ for all $i,j,k,l$, where $a$, $b$ denote the coefficients of $A$, $B:=A^{-1}$. Since $\sum_j a_{1,j}b_{j,1}=1$, there is a $j_0$ such that $a_{1,j_0} b_{j_0,1} \in R^{\times}$. Let $A'=a_{1,j_0}^{-1} A$. Then the coefficients of $A'^{-1} = a_{1,j_0} B$ are in $R$, and those of $A'$ also because $\frac{a_{i,j}}{a_{1,j_0} }= \frac{a_{i,j}b_{j_0,1}}{a_{1,j_0}b_{j_0,1}} \in R$. For a general $R$, this just shows that $A \in K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n (R_m) $ for any maximal ideal $m$ of $R$. Edit: This implies that the normalizer is indeed $K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ in the case $R$ is a UFD. Indeed we have that $I^n=(\det (A))$ where $I=\sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} R$ by localization ($i/\det(A) \in \cap_m R_m = R$ for any $i$ product of $n$ coefficients of $A$). Looking at decompositions, we see that $\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j})^n = \det(A)$, and so $A/\\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. 

I couldn't see any way of attacking this without reflexivity, so I started thinking about counter examples. Of course, all Banach lattices are immediately disqualified from potential counterexamples. The best hope I had for an example was something like $X:=\mathbb{R}\oplus_{1}C_{0}(\mathbb{R})$ with the (ice-cream) cone $X_{+}:=\{(t,f)\in X:t\geq\|f\|_{\infty}\}$, but every pair of elements turns out to have a minimal upper bound... 

Vi Hart is a master at doing the opposite: Presenting mathematics, which on the surface seems to be aimed at laymen, but is actually aimed at mathematicians in my opinion. Granted, those mathematicians might be young, and may not have realized yet that they actually are mathematicians. This video from her is actually fairly deep, while following Andrej Bauer's 8 suggestions above almost to the letter. 

A characterization doesn't seem to exist, but Batty & Robinson does give one necessary condition to have this property. 

For the representations of abelian and compact groups we can go through the motions and show that this is indeed the case without ever needing to resort to this isomorphism of categories (take a look at the Peter-Weyl theorem for compact groups on wikipedia). However, for a unitary representation on a seperable Hilbert space of a separable non-abelian, non-compact, locally compact groups things become more difficult but still works. To get a result, the rough idea is as follows: We transfer everything to the category of representations of $C^\ast (G)$, and invoke von Neumann algebra theory to show that every such representation can be written as a "direct integral" of irreducibles and then transfer back to the category of group representations to conclude that every such unitary group representation can be reduced to a direct integral of irreducables. Details are in Chapter 14 of "Real reductive groups. II" by Nolan R. Wallach UPDATE: As Yemon pointed out things are not as simple as first thought, and what I remembered reading in Wallach is not what I actually read. 

Assume $L/k$ normal, and take $\sigma \in G$, which can be extended to an element of $Gal(L/k)$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu} \in L$, and if $\gamma$ is the nontrivial element of $Gal(L/K)$, $\sigma^{-1} \gamma \sigma$ is trivial on $K$, and being nontrivial on $L$ it has to be equal to $\gamma$. So $\gamma\left( \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\mu \right) = \sigma(\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}))/\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, so we can take $\alpha_{\sigma} = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, it is an element of $K$. Now for the other way, take $\tilde{\sigma} \in Gal(\bar{L}/k)$. Denote the restriction of $\tilde{\sigma}$ to $K$ by $\sigma$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}= \pm \alpha_{\sigma}$ (this equality is in $\bar{L}$), so $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \pm \alpha_{\sigma} \sqrt{\mu} \in L$, so $L$ is normal. Consider a set-theoretic section $\sigma \mapsto \tilde{\sigma}$ for the surjective morphism $Gal(L/k) \rightarrow G$. Then the (up to a coboundary) 2-cocycle $\beta_0$ associated to the group extension is given by the formula $\tilde{\sigma} \tilde{\tau} = \beta_0(\sigma,\tau) \widetilde{\sigma \tau}$. Evaluating at $\sqrt{\mu}$ gives the equality between $\beta$ and $\beta_0$, if for every $\sigma \in G$, $\alpha_{\sigma} = \tilde{\sigma}(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$. You can always choose your section so that it is the case (change of section = associating a sign to each $\sigma \in G$). 

As HenrikRüping wrote, my comment is false. Nevertheless, I think the method is interesting (obviously, it isn't mine), although it gives something "explicit", but not "compact". Maybe you could provide us with context? For example, are you interested in the behavior when $k \rightarrow + \infty$ (assuming the field is topological)? If $XAX^{-1}$ and $YQY^{-1}$ are "nice" (diagonal or Jordan normal form), then make the change of variable (is this English?) $P'=XPY$. Then viewing $S_k$ as a linear function of $P$, $XS_k(P)Y=\sum_{i=1}^k XAX^{-1} P' YQY^{-1}$, so up to a change of base on $M_{m,n}(K)$, the endomorphism $S_k$ of this vector space is given in a nice form (eigenvalues are known). But I'm not sure this is really what you're asking for, and your last comment suggests you already know what I just wrote.
