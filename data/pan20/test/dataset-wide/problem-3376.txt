What different definitions of phoneme do you know? Please note that I'm not asking for an explanation of what phoneme is but rather for professional definitions. I'm interested in how the issue is tackled in different phonological theories. Edit: It sure is very interesting (no irony) to see how different authors explain why they're not going to refer to phoneme in their work. However, if you come across a definition (of the kind of definitions of terms that they have in mathematics), I will be still grateful if you cared to add it or refer to it here. 

A complement to the answers above: The alphabet used for transcribing and the level of transcription are frequently confused. IPA can, just as any other alphabet, be used for both phonetic and phonemic transcription (the difference has already been neatly explained), or anything in between. One might argue IPA is richer, poorer, more or less readable, flexible, regular, whatever, but in principle there is nothing in it, or any other alphabet, that forces you to use it at any particular level of abstraction. Alphabet and level of abstraction are two independent variables. 

This is a good observation and a good question, and the comments below it make a valid point, as well. In short, I would say that there is no such thing as a solid cross-linguistic concept of 'proper nouns' -- or at least, none commonly accepted and adhered to. My own experience is that the term is primarily used to refer to what you could call prototypical proper nouns (Coca-Cola, Berlin, John Brown &c.), and rarely to not so clear cases. I suppose there might have been more than one attempt at a proper definition, but neither has gained enough following to be even known of by the majority of linguists. Here a long and passionate rant is in order on the attitude towards properly defined terms in linguistics, but instead I'll just say that you might not be able to even find a single term which every linguist understands the same way for every language. You will, however, have no difficulty finding a linguist who can't give a proper and cross-linguistically solid definition for virtually any term he or she's used while talking to you. Basing a definition on language-specific spelling is obviously not a great idea, although in some cases it might be the best we have. 'Whatever's written between spaces' remains the best definition of word I know. If you were to create a definition of your own, I suppose you should try to capture the common and distinctive features of the prototypical cases. You should not, however, get your hopes up about how many linguists will memorize it and adhere to it. It's a hopeless bunch in this regard. 

Consider the examples you have given more closely. Surely, the key is that in the variants with antepenultimate stress, the penultimate vowel sound is reduced to a near-schwa or schwa sound. Conversely, in the penultimate stress variants, the vowel will likely be Anglicized in a different way. Note that in either pronunciation of "Uranus", the "a" sounds nothing like a Latin a. In this way, the general principle of the rule you cite is maintained. When we initially hear foreign words, we will naturally try to approximate the pronunciation. There is no good reason why variant pronunciations of foreign-origin words shouldn't exist, especially when English pronunciation itself is so varied - no doubt influencing the pronunciation of the foreign word. 

I will attempt to answer this, but please understand that it is more of a guess since the comments to your question are correct. This may not even be the kind of question that can be answered here. Remember that thou was more than just the "second person singular" - it was later an informal pronoun as well, and picked up connotations of referring to someone of lower social standing than yourself. We can see different usages frozen in time in different contexts (religiously, thou lingered with a different connotation than it did in the phrase "holier than thou" or "Get thee gone!"). The meaning probably still continues to change*. Once "thou" had the connotation of suggesting the lower social status of someone, you can see how this would become problematic in a society that was becoming increasingly egalitarian (and perhaps still is). At some point, the old "familiar" usage is polluted with a tinge of disdain/inferiority that was inappropriate for the context and it was preferable to borrow another form to show that the speaker was not presuming his own superiority. 

While this is a fair question, I think there are several factors which argue against Modern Hebrew being considered an artificial language: 

It sounds like what you are really looking for is linguistic evidence of a Semitic substrate in Old English. Not being a linguist, you chose words which sounded similar in various languages and asked about the potential relationships. This, as you have found out by the answers you got, is not really the right way to go about establishing such a relationship. Don't be alarmed, as your mistake is very common. If you want to continue this search on your own, you should first read the wikipedia entry on language strata. You may also want to read up on historical linguistics generally, and this hypothesis which specifically concerns itself with a Semitic influence on the Germanic languages. 

The website for the SR parser explicitly states that the measures were for parsing on the Penn Treebank WSJ (Wall Street Journal) corpus, section 23: 

However, it seems to me that these phrases are not typical idioms because their meaning is at least partly compositional, unlike e.g. kick the bucket: Nevertheless, they invoke a more nuanced meaning than the composition of the words themselves implies, and there even seems to be some contrast between these expressions and a pure generative usage of the above phrases: 

There exist certain fixed expressions which people use to convey quite specific meanings and (at least to me) always invoke a famous saying which is assumed to be common knowledge, such as 

However, my understanding of what a pun is has only rarely matched what people do in actual real life, namely in that the sentence has to have multiple, non-metaphorical interpretations† which are nevertheless both gramatically correct and lexically appropriate. In the example above, there is usage a nonce word (irrelephant) which seems to be a blend of elephant and irrelevant used for humorous effect. However, this word would be unusable outside of the pun, e.g. Oxfam is an irrelephant charity would not convey the meaning "Oxfam is a charitable organization which does not focus on issues relevant to elephants". Contrast the previous example with "true" puns according to the criteria above: 

†According to my understanding, a seemingly innocous expression which can be interpreted entirely differently in a different context is a double entendre, meaning that one difference between a double entendre and a pun is that the former is context-dependent where the latter is not (e.g. Groucho Marx' If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?); Is this a correct interpretation, or have I got this wrong as well? 

In example 1, the contrast in meaning is due to an interpretation of go against the grain as an idiom as opposed to a literal interpretation thereof. Likewise, in example 2, there is a contrast between the semantics of wurst and worst, which nevertheless are homographs: The meanings of the two sentences are completely different but are equally acceptable in the given context. However, despite me being able to suss out differences between puns using nonce blend words and those using only extant words, I seem to be the only person who makes a distinction between the two: For example, numerous usages of both types can be observed in BuzzFeed's In Defense of Puns video and "blending puns" in fact are used much more frequently than the "true" puns I discussed here. Are these both just called "puns"? — Is there no finer-grained terminology for describing these literary devices?
