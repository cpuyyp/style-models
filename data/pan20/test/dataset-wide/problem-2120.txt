If you're a senior developer, you're generally expected to know why the software you make matters. So while there's nothing wrong with: 

Be prepared to answer questions like "how often does this happen?" "how long has this been going on?" and of course, "Who are we talking about?". That last one you can answer or not -- but you might as well, because even when people don't tell me who they were complaining about, I always know who it is. Bosses vary so you might be told to stop helping, to help and document, or a number of other things. But you will not be helping a deception any longer. You might be told to work it out with the coworker. If so, you can try saying a few things but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to improve anything. In my experience people who come to rely on coworkers to carry them don't stop when the coworkers object, even if they are threatened with exposure. You might even be told that the person is question is wildly overworked and is doing things you're unaware of, that your help is needed, and that you should keep right on doing it. That's why it's key not to say that you want to stop helping at the start of the conversation. Bottom line for me is the way I felt a week after the departure of a poorly performing employee when the team as a whole got MORE DONE with less people and each of them individually confessed to taking entire assignments from this person, finishing them, and putting them somewhere the (now former) employee could get them and submit them as being finished (eg checkins or emails that identify who is submitting the work.) They thought they were being nice to someone having a tough time. I felt like I had been tricked into running a charity. It wasn't nice. 

Since forgetting can go both ways, use these notes also to record what you learn in the interview. So summarize things you think you'll be asked, but also things you want to know - regular working hours, travel policy, dress code, whatever. Many interviews start with the interviewer "telling you a little about us" which can be a real information dump. By already having the headings in your notes, you can just jot down the things that matter to you. Stuff like when they were founded or the name of their most important product you don't need to record in your notes, so having these headings will help you cope with the stream of information. More importantly, it will get the interviewer used to you interacting with your notes. Because if I ask you "so, you graduated 18 months ago?" and you pause, run your finger down a page of notes to find an item, and then say "yes, that's right" I'm going to be extremely suspicious. People generally know these things about themselves. You probably know what your best classes are, and that your highest mark ever is a 98 or an 83 or whatever without notes, right? I don't need to be told the 16 most recent grades you received. I probably don't even care what your average is. So make sure you can answer simple questions without the notes, or that you can cover up the fact you're checking your notes for even the simplest question. But if it's just about not forgetting to ask if they pay for overtime, then absolutely write that question in your notes and leave room right next to it to write the answer. Then as the interview progresses if you are told things without you having to ask them, make a note in that blank space. When you get to the end and they ask if you have any questions, now is the time to let them see you running through the list and asking any that didn't come up, or saying "we seem to have covered everything I came here to find out, thanks!" 

Context is very important for this question. Large companies generally handle it differently from small ones. The largest we ever got was 11 people. If someone left, there were lots of questions in the minds of those remaining. Along with "who is going to finish that work?" and "what are we telling clients if they ask?" there was often also "is this information that changes anything for me or makes me feel less secure?" I would have an all-hands meeting as soon as the person involved was told, and I would give an explanation that wasn't specific enough to violate confidences, but wasn't vague enough to leave them worrying about themselves. Examples: 

I think it's excellent that you have a list like this in your head. You may not be right about the costs and benefits of cubicles, or a particular operating system, or any other tool, but you know what you want and that's great. It will give you a great source of questions in your interviews, and if you ask a company why they use something you have dismissed, you may learn a lot about them, including why they wouldn't be a good fit for you. However I think it's a very bad idea to put it on your resume. It says a great deal about your attitude and approach to work, not all of it good, and without you there to temper that with your intelligence and general desirability. My people don't have cubicles, and if someone's resume or cover letter said "I don't want to work in a place that has cubicles" I might react by feeling "ah, I have a good chance with this candidate, great." But if that cover letter went on to more specific tools that you refuse to use -- not because you don't like them but because you know what's best for my company and what is cost effective -- then I might switch to more of a "who do you think you are?" mindset. Your disclaimer, that these are not preferences but that you know better than I do how to make my company money by choosing specific tools, makes this worse, not better. This isn't even about experience, or whether it's your job to choose tools rather than use them, or how much you know about the rest of what a company does (some tools that frontline workers hate produce great reports for management, some expensive tools that seem no better than the free ones to you have features used by other people in the company you're ignoring) it's about your desire to take a choice that is very complicated and situation-dependent, and just make it black and white. You don't know my company. You don't prepare the tax returns. You don't know our customers. You don't know what we have to provide. But you're sure we're using the wrong tool if we're using X. If I read that, then even if I don't use X I don't want to hire the person who is so sure of their ability to handle this better than me. We would just butt heads the whole time, it's not worth it. So have a list, and ask intelligent questions about it in the interview. Not "do you use X?" "Yes we do." "Ok, thanks for your time, I could never work here." But "what do you use for [whatever]?" "We use X." "Oh, I looked into that, but my firm chose Y. Can you tell me a little about how X is more appropriate for this firm?" If the answer you get is "none of your business" or "it makes it easy for us to crush the very souls of our workers" then you can stick with your conclusion that you don't want to work here. But they might surprise you. 

Business is complicated. Sometimes "we care enough about your problems to take the developer off his coding tasks and send him to you" is a powerful gift to a customer that can bring a tremendous amount of revenue to the company. In that case your theories about telecommuting and whatnot are worse than irrelevant. Other times, your boss is an idiot. I know you think that's what's happening here, but it might not be, and you haven't given us enough information to know. The way I see it you have three choices: 

We all have our pet peeves and we all have our weaknesses. I have a client who uses question marks at the end of sentences and not at the end of questions. 

It is not normal for people to be successful in declaring parts of their evaluation to be incorrect. Whether you feel that a statement isn't accurate ("you said I take too long to do X, but that's because I get all the hard X'es to do") or a condition isn't important ("you said some of the customers think I'm rude, but that doesn't matter because I write great code and that's whats important") your boss is paid to do a number of things that you (presumably) are not yet as good at: 

Most non-technical web sites are going to be bad tasks. Don't get in that habit even if your peers do. If you have a headset, and it has a good range, you can also go for a walk around the office. This is slightly less boring than staring at your screen and good for your energy levels, but you aren't going to miss a call if one comes in. 

That will give you the information you need while showing yourself to be someone cautious who asks before assuming you have permission. There's no mention of another job or of using the prestige they've given you for your own immediate benefit. If there is no policy at the moment, asking this way is, in my opinion, more likely to get you a yes than mentioning the other job first and then asking. But you are not lying or deceiving by asking this way. And of course, if they say no, respect that. Tell the other job you are working on websites for "clients whose names I can't reveal, but you would recognize", which is almost as good. 

Declining the trip could be a career-limiting move. I would tread carefully. Is this about not wanting to give up a weekend day? If so, then the compensation part doesn't matter, weekend time is personal time, end of story. Perhaps next time the meeting could be on a Tuesday so you could travel Monday. Is this about not wanting to "work" without being paid for it? This is harder to argue (people worry about looking selfish) but easy for the boss to fix, since by either paying you or offering you an extra day of vacation time, the boss can get you to go to the meeting. (This is why it's important to know your objection.) Is this about not wanting to waste the company's money on plane tickets, hotel rooms, and your time, when someone could cover for you? That is so not your problem. If you're willing to go, go, and leave your boss' job to your boss. I have flown literally around the world to deliver a single one-hour talk, and have a few days of networking and socializing. Everyone involved thought that a good use of time and money. Is this about finding such a long flight, and presumably a time change, and having to sleep in a hotel and eat in restaurants, unpleasant? If it is, even a mid-week meeting would never work for you. You need to make that clear. Once you know what your sticking point is, don't go and say "I want to teleconference to that meeting." You will be forcing your boss to "interview" the problem out of you. Instead say once of these. 

I never tell people specifically where they fell short. You may think this is a nice thing to do, but causes the majority of followuppers to reply arguing with you - actually I have excellent communication skills! - I think you'll find jQuery excellence is not required for that job! - I defy you to find anyone with better graphic design skills than me! - or insisting that you consider them for a different position in the firm. (I used to say we would "keep your resume in case something came up", but that caused one person to email me once a month asking if anything had come up yet, so I removed the sentence from then on.) Occasionally I include an extra sentence in this email. I told one applicant
