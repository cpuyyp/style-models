First off, don't even think of attempting this if its raining or thunderstorms are nearby. Not only will water make the rock slick, but the prominence and the metal cables make people on the route prime targets for lighting strikes. You are going to want to wear grippy shoes because of the slick granite and gloves to protect your hands. What you are going to want to do to prevent a catastrophic fall is to clip yourself in to the cables. The minimum equipment for that is a rock climbing harness and a via ferrata setup. A rock climbing helmet would also be a good idea. The caribiners will need to be regular sized (not mini). As you go up the cables, you will have one caribiner connected to the cable at all times. When you get to a post, clip the other caribiner onto the cable on the other side of the post, before removing the first. Like this. 

The easy way to think of this is that tracks left in concrete sidewalks are true tracks while pouring plaster of paris into animals tracks left in mud would results in a cast. Sometimes the dinosaur tracks were made in materials that turned to stone and were then preserved as true tracks, and sometimes the tracks were made in soft materials and then filled in with other materials that turned to stone and the only the cast is preserved. The standard diagram explaining this is, 

Source People will say that in the study the people who used bear spray were uninjured compared to the people who used firearms, but since people have been seriously injured while using bear spray, it seems that the data is incomplete. To put bear attacks in perspective, you are far more likely to be stabbed/robbed/murdered/raped by the two legged creatures you encounter and yet lots of people don't carry weapons to prepare for that eventuality. So I am not sure that I would say that the guides don't carry firearms because they are confident of not needing the them. 

Sometimes in my travels in Nevada, I would come across white pvc pipes standing up in the middle of nowhere sticking out like sore thumbs. They looked like this (the red arrow points to another one further up the hill) 

The reason that this happens is that instead of calculating the slope correctly as Rise over Run, Google Earth calculates it as Rise over Hypotenuse. So if you had your standard 3x4x5 right triangle, 

TLDR: No, they were found all over North America before the Europeans arrived and are being reintroduced into the Appalachian mountains. I can see them preferring the plains instead of mountains in the absence of hunting pressure, but I haven't found any evidence that they were absent from the mountains. Also, herds of elk are much easier to spot in open plains as compared to forests, that might have something to do with it. 

Source The study that this information comes from is called, Cache protection strategies of a scatter-hoarding rodent: do tree squirrels engage in behavioural deception? and is unfortunately paywalled. 

These are mining claim markers that mark the edges of the claim. The ones in the picture are legal, because the tops are capped. If the tops were not capped, it would be legal to pull them out and set them on the ground. 

TLDR: It has happened once to a dog and it is possible that it could happen to birds but I can find no instances of it happening. In rare cases, skunk spray can have more effects than just smell on a dog. 

Note - The following methods probably won't work for your situation after you updated the question with more information, but they might work for someone else with a similar problem, so I am leaving them here. Method using GPS and compass. 

Source Obviously, stars are going to rise in the east and set in the west but what about the movement left to right? Does that stay the same in both hemispheres? 

Balling up is when the snow starts sticking to the bottom of your crampons to the point that the crampon points are no longer touching the surface. As one can imagine this is a rather dangerous situation. They do make anti-balling plates that are supposed to keep this from happening, but I have still had problems even with the plates. Are there any recommended techniques in addition to using anti-balling plates to keep this from happening? 

How to call emergency numbers from your Sat Phone and for the specific numbers for Chile. Note: I have not tested this, but the numbers should be correct. 

As far as the calculations go, if you are on course the back bearing should be 180 degrees to your direction of travel. So if you had started out on a course of 270 degrees, then the back bearing should be 90 degrees. Of course, you can also use the forward direction with your compass to navigate, but it can be nice to be able to take a back bearing in a situation like this and confirm that you are on the same heading as when you started. 

Last summer I did a yo-yo of both the Toyaibe Crest and the Ruby mountains while also summitting both Mt Wheeler and Boundary Peak. The mountains aren’t particularly dangerous, other than the big summits I did there really wasn’t any times where I was particularly concerned. 

Horses are bigger and stronger and than humans and because of the square cube law, they have more mass to surface area which makes them better suited to fording deeper/faster rivers. As to whether or not you could cross where the horses do, that will depend on the individual crossing. You probably couldn't cross at all of the places horses can, but that doesn't mean that you would be able to cross at none of them. 

If a climber on top rope, takes a fall, there isn't much force at all compared with the forces that are generated when a lead climber falls. That force has the potential to pull the belayer into something or even off the ground and into the climber. There is also a risk, when the lead climber first starts out of falling (before clipping anything) and decking on top of the belayer. Beyond that you want to pay much closer attention to the climber when leading, since you have to pay out enough slack that the climber is not held back, while at the same time not having too much out. The slack on a top rope climber can be done just by feel for the most part. So yes, it is more difficult and has a higher potential of injury. 

Source With that said they are also easy to improvise so it might be worth the effort to make one. However, it might be better to improvise a bow as that would take less practice to use. 

After looking through all of the pages of Google Image search slime molds, I was unable to find anything that resembled the brown stuff in the above images. There is a list of the Slime Molds of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington and nothing in that looks similar either. I would say that it is runny scat from an unknown animal. 

I find this bug while hiking the Toiyabe Crest Trail in Nevada. It was probably 2 inches long and at an elevation of somewhere around 6,000 feet or so. 

Bringing gear up when climbing high won't really affect the rate. There is a possibility that a higher pressure system could increase the amount of oxygen, but true acclimatization takes long enough that it probably won't matter. According to the Altitude Research Center 

I find abandoned sunglasses fairly frequently, right now the snow shoe and cross country trails are melting, and all of the sunglasses that were lost during the winter are now visible. I don't find them often enough to carry a sunglasses case just for this scenario, but would like to know how I can protect them when I don't have a case, as one can often clean them up and make them useful again. Is there a good way of improvising protection for sunglasses without a case? 

See how the angle between the red and the green lines in Example B is much smaller than the one in Example A, and yet the difference between where the red line intersects the black line and where the green line intersects the black line is much greater. Beyond using multiple points, there are other ways to do this. For instance if you are on a long natural feature like a trail or stream or ridge, you can take one bearing to a feature off to the side. 

This is something I have pondered on multiple occasions, when the light of the full moon and the altitude induced insomnia kept me awake long into the night. I realize that this would be an unusual strategy, but I have heard of people doing it, such as Jedediah Smith while crossing a desert on his explorations or this person who was going to try to break the unsupported and without resupply speed record on the John Muir Trail. Would there be any advantages to hiking during the night and sleeping during the day? 

In the absence of inversions, going up mountains will bring you into lower temperatures as you get higher. What is the rule of thumb for how the temperature decreases with altitude? 

Then wait 15-20 minutes for the star to move and compare its new position to the old one marked by your sticks. 

My standard procedure when hunting is to hunt with a round in the chamber, safety on and as soon as the day is over or while getting into a vehicle to remove the bullet from the chamber. This can happen a lot since it's not unusual to go several days without firing a shot, does chambering the round over and over again result in a loss of accuracy compared to a round that has only been chambered once? 

If you are hunting elk in a team of two people with one attempting to call it in and the other to kill it, where should the caller be in relation to the hunter? 

Given that temperature decreases with altitude, and yet inversions happen where cold air is below warmer air, as a general rule of thumb, where would the warmest place to sleep be? Here is one place that would be a good example. It on North Fork of the San Joaquin river in the Ansel Adams wilderness in California. As one goes over Glacier pass there are about 5 levels where camping is possible, with a combined elevation difference of about 1700ft. 

After picking berries, you are often left with a pail full of berries, some leaves, some sticks, pieces of stems, sometimes little white worm creatures and some dirt. Is there an easy way to clean a whole bunch of them at once so that you are left with just the berries? 

What does moose scat/poop look like and how can one distinguish it from the other similar scats namely deer and elk?

I have never liked heights, but I have still done a lot of things because I wanted to get to the top more than I was afraid of heights. I think that the best thing to do is to let this friend decide on where he would like to go, and let his motivation decide how much risk (real or perceived) you take. It also helps with the fear of heights to get used to it, for me that has always been hanging belays where you hang around at the top of the cliff for a while and eventually you get used to it. 

$URL$ Its not uncommon for a rope to have pilling or to not look as nice after a lot of belaying. I have seen pilling pile up when lowering with a Gri Gri so it doesn't surprise me. In summary this type of wear and tear is normal and probably not related to your specific device. However, it would still probably be a good idea to ask an expert who can physically examine the rope and belay device. They should also be able to teach you how to check your gear. If you wanted gear that will last longer, try a static as opposed to a dynamic rope and steel instead of aluminium caribiners and belay devices. The only way of avoiding this type of wear and tear is to stop climbing :) 

The carabiners are definitely good to go as those are pretty standard ratings. Most climbers using climbing harnesses and not body harnesses, I would suggest that you buy a climbing harness as I think that it would work better and be more comfortable for you. 

What you will want to do is to find which way a star is moving. The way to do this, is to line up two objects pointing towards where the star is currently at, like so. 

The reason is that you could miss your destination and hit a trail and know that you are almost there, but not know which way to turn. 

After watching this video of a man punching a kangaroo to rescue his dog, I am wondering how dangerous a kangaroo is to a human on foot? I am sure that there are a lot of other things in Australia that are dangerous as well, but are kangaroos something that a person would need to worry about? 

If you look through the list of owls in Idaho, or the list of owls in North America you will notice that the only white owl is the Snowy Owl. It seems far more likely that you saw a snowy owl in a forest where it was temporarily passing through, than you saw a different species that no one else has seen. There aren't many trees in the arctic, 

Anytime your brake hand is in front of the braking plane, you are not able to hold a fall without moving it behind the braking plane. While pulling in slack with this method, your brake hand will be in front of the braking plane. Usually, it happens fast enough that it is not a problem, but sometimes people fail to lock off and leave their hand in front of the braking plane. At that point it would be more than reasonable to yell at them and tell them to get it together. Sometimes this method does make more sense, and in that case the solution is to use a muntor hitch. A muntor hitch does not suffer from the braking plane problem, and in fact generates the most friction when the rope strands are parralel. 

I think the warning was aimed more at people who were using horses and mules for transportation as an animal is much heavier than a backpacker. I crossed the bridge with no problems, but if I was using stock, how would I assess the safety of the bridge? 

The main reason that I found is for cutting a cornice, sometimes referred to as the bombs of the backcountry. 

When geese are feeding it is not specified as far as I can tell, but during nesting it is the male who does the guarding. 

In some parts of the western United States there are herds of wild horses. How dangerous could a herd be to a human on foot while hiking or backpacking? If they are dangerous how should a human protect themselves? 

There is a definitely a risk of starting a fire with a flare gun, for this reason they are discouraged by the National Park Service (at least in Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument). 

Finally, if you were going to use this for an anchor you would clip one carabiner through each of the loops. This is also why some people refer to it as a bunny ears knot. 

There are no trails from the viewpoint up to the summit and everything between the viewer and the summit is public land. If one were to say, "Wow that looks like a cool mountain, let's go climb that" are there any general rules of thumb as to what to look for when planning a route? 

This has been a problem for quite a while, it used to be that one needed really good paper maps to be able to tell. Now there are chips for GPS units that show the ownership of the land on the map (there are also apps for phones) with an overlay of the property types and boundaries. That way people can know where the property lines are and can avoid trespassing and are better able to access public lands. These were mostly designed with hunters in mind (sometimes hunting areas are limited to public land or vice versa) but they could also be useful for hiking and backpacking in areas where there is private land mixed in with public. There are a number of different makers of these chips (basically memory cards) / apps what you are going to want to search for to find them is 

Image Source there aren't any places with mangroves that don't also have alligators. On the other hand, there are places on this map of cypress swamps that extend farther north than the range of alligators.
