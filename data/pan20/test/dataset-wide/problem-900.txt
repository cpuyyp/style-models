He also doesn't spin Amira's "ball so the men can find husbands" suggestion into a competition for her hand--in fact, Amira is the one who brings up the idea of her being a prize in a contest. So, what could he mean? My suggestion (though it's a guess only, of course): the king could marry Amira himself. This meets all his requirements, would almost certainly be considered "unspeakable" by Amira (and disgusting by Tabitha, when she reacts later), and is a motif found in several other fairy tales. Donkeyskin and The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter are two of the most prominent, but there are a variety of stories that involve this--usually because the daughter is the only one beautiful enough to fulfill some sort of condition. However, as this story is pretty explicitly about the patriarchy and various people's roles in it, I think it makes sense that the king's reasoning would be changed a little here, especially as he's shown to take pity on and emphasize with the men re his daughter's "irresistibility," as well as to meld with the other tales more seamlessly. 

So, it's reasonable for no one to say "here's how Susan is reacting to the death of her whole family", given that, well, her family doesn't know they all died. They expect to go back to our world. The last time they saw Susan, they were all alive and Susan was "silly." (Note: Lewis's opinion, not mine, etc.) The omnicient narrator doesn't bring it up at the time because at that point, the reader is also not supposed to know this. The revelation that they're in Heaven doesn't happen until the very, very end of the novel (literally the second to last paragraph), at which point there's enough grand-scale wrapping up to do, and enough on the characters' mind, that the narration doesn't return to Susan. 

In a lot of historical romance novels (specifically those set in Regency England), people decide to get married very suddenly a lot of the time. You see this a lot in the marriage of convenience trope, but also in various other flavours of historical romance. When this happens, they usually either end up running away to Gretna Green (because apparently anyone there can witness/perform marriages, at least in the era historical romances are usually set) or getting a "special licence" that allows them to get married very quickly. What's this special licence? Why is it needed? Is this an actual thing that was required of people of the time, or is it merely a romance novel trope that allows the author to sidestep the actual laws/rules of marriage in that time period? 

As I interpret it, the pressure of the daily grind is literally tearing people apart. It breaks buildings, it breaks families (likely speaking of divorce, here - the pressure getting so great that it chips away at the family until they can't take it and they divorce, or otherwise become estranged from each other), and it breaks people. Basically, this song is speaking about the extreme pressures of modern life - the daily grind and this whole idea of having to have the most and be the best and richest and work the hardest, which can take a great toll on people, to the point where it can cause people to fall into poverty, and thus lose their homes and end up living on the streets. The chorus emphasizes this idea of the pressure of the world and of life, and how no one wants to be a part of it, but there is no escaping it: "It's the terror of knowing what the world is about Watching some good friends screaming 'Let me out'" Once people realize the stress that just trying to keep your ahead above water in modem society entails, it becomes this self serving endless circle, where you can't get ahead and the pressure of knowing that makes it harder to get ahead, so eventually you are so far behind that you can potentially end up on the streets in extreme poverty. 

That's why The Last Battle doesn't bring it up. Re Lewis: presumably, Susan grieved for her family. She may even have turned to religion in her grief, which would bring her back towards the path to Aslan's country, though Lewis said would be a longer journey for her. However, that doesn't change the fact that the reason she's still alive is that she's, erm, a teenager who likes nylons and lipsticks rather than Aslan--that's what makes her "silly" according to Lewis, that state of mind; not her reaction to a specific event. 

(Please note: I'm not a expert in Christian/Lewis in particular's theology; this is my impression primarily from the text of the book.) Peter, Edmund, Lucy and the rest don't know they're dead until the very end of The Last Battle. At the time the discussion of Susan occurs, everyone--including the reader--thinks they simply were pulled through another portal to Narnia, right before, during, or instead of the crash. Peter thinks that Susan didn't come with them because she's no longer a friend of Narnia and didn't come on the train + through the portal with them, not because she's still alive. (The real reason is both, of course.) 

Expanding from my comment. Warning for disturbing themes and also a lot of links to fairy tales. "Seasons of Glass and Iron" pulls from several fairy tales. It looks to me that variations on The Princess on the Glass Hill, The Enchanted Pig, and The Black Bull of Norroway are most prominent--however, there are references to many others scattered throughout. Tabitha thinks of her brother with winged sandals, and of women forced to wear "shoes of glass; ... shoes of iron heated red–hot." Amira references "words of desire [that] tumbled from men’s lips like diamonds and toads," and "a story about nettle shirts thrown up to swans." Therefore, I think it's reasonable to look at other fairy tales for inspiration as to what the king and Amira could have meant. Here's what we know his requirements are: 

He's most likely being sarcastic. I'm having trouble finding anywhere else where the cat uses that kind of direct sarcasm, but such sarcasm definitely fits with the style of ironic verbal abuse that comprises most of his narration: 

The structure of the sentence also fits with a sarcastic interpretation. If you leave off the last bit, it says "The children, dear little things, now trot off, day after day, to kindergarten: but on their return, they sing songs, bounce balls [...]". Without the last bit, they do sound like dear little things, nice children who trot off to kindergarten for fun and learning, then return home and enjoy an idyllic afternoon of singing and bouncing balls. But the cat then slips in at the end that they sometimes hang him up by the tail, which is not dear or idyllic at all; it's something that nasty little children who will probably grow up to be serial killers would do. The line also plays into the narrative conceit of the book. The cat is privy to all sorts of things that no human knows about, because he can go anywhere unnoticed, like a fly on the wall. Maybe even more unnoticed—I swat at flies if I see them, but I wouldn't chase off a cat. To anyone else, the children probably do seem like dear little things with their songs and their balls, but the cat knows something more about them, that they're also little monsters who hang him up by his tail and pitch him out of bed. 

In Binti by Nnedi Okorafor, the main character Binti has an object she refers to as an "edan" - it's an object that allows her to communicate with another species she encounters, and seems to have other properties as well. She mentions that it's some sort of ancient technology that no one knows what it is anymore or what it was used for. There's not a lot of description in the book, just that it is metal and round (I think). It can also come apart into pieces, although I'm not sure if that's part of the design intentionally. Is there any real-world object that it is based on, or that it is intended to mimic? 

It's been a long time since I've read the books, but I read a lot of romances, and the idea is similar. Basically, she's teasing him about cunnilingus (the act of giving oral sex to a female/someone with a vulva) - she's surprised he knew what to do (or perhaps more accurately, surprised it is something someone would even think to do), and is curious how he knew how to please her. So the remark is both her commenting on how he treats her differently than others (perhaps differently from other Northern men she's been with, which is why she asked about people in a different locale - she's assuming he might have been with someone more "foreign" who would have taught him these things). In general, the idea of orally pleasing a woman isn't the first thing most men think to do in most of the "medieval" environments that get written about - the idea is the woman is generally there for the man's pleasure, so not much time is taken to make sure the lady also gets the happy ending, as it were. So she didn't expect him to take the time to make sure she was pleased as well, and thus her curiosity at where he might have picked up such a skill. Also, it's somewhat of a joke/innuendo in and of itself, the way she asks about it - "is that what lords do to their ladies, down in the south" - the south referring both to geography, and the southern/lower half of a woman's body, often neglected in terms of pleasure and merely considered just the area where the guy inserts tab A into slot B until he reaches his own pleasurable climax. 

As well as several more times afterward. My immediate thought when I first read Chapter I was that it symbolized his lack of empathy (i.e. metaphorical blindness to the feelings of others), which led his sons to revolt and throw him out, but he does seem genuinely sad that his wife, Myratana, has died. Also, the arc of the story didn't seem to quite fit this reading. His lack of empathy doesn't seem to ever come back to bite him in a straightforward way: he gets exactly what he wanted, killing all his children with his curse; his brothers Ijim and Zazel remain in exile where he put them; and he dies as he wanted, cursing his own father, Har, for creating one set of laws meant to apply to everyone. Aside from the rebellion of his sons, everything pretty much seems to go his way. What does the blindness signify? 

In both poems, other people chide the narrator for dreaming instead of living in the present, and in both poems the narrator defies them, but in "A Dream" the narrator asserts a greater truth to be found in the dream, and chooses to dwell there as a way of preserving the goodness in his life: 

In this case, whitewashing is basically exactly what it sounds like. It's taking a canonically PoC (Person of Colour) character and portraying them as white instead, either through art or film or fanfic or what have you. Basically, taking away any reference to their race and making them look/act like a white person, even though the canonical media states/references them being...not that. So in this case, where canon clearly establishes Blaise as being Black, fanfic authors saying he has features associated with whiteness, or artists drawing him as such, are whitewashing. They're removing any reference to his canonically PoC description as established in the books. This is very common in films, where PoC roles will be cast instead with white people. Note that this is different from blackface or yellowface where the white people are made up to look like they're a different race - instead, the whole idea of them being non-white is completely removed from their representation in the (usually visual) work. 

The line "I fight for all the voices you silence in all in the name of what is right" is the hardest line for me, because it echoes of not only present day, where the voices of the privileged get so much more airtime, but also echoes all these times in history where we tried to make things right by allowing the louder voices to trample the quieter ones, where we tried to make everyone equal not by allowing everyone a voice and a stance, but by making them as much like the privileged group as possible, regardless of how much that made sense, or how much pain it caused. Also, it is a very performative act - while the person with privilege is speaking for the other person, the marginalized person is speaking the same words BUT SILENTLY. You literally get to watch the act of someone's voice being forcefully removed and being replaced by a well meaning privileged ally. tl;dr they do it because it makes for a damn powerful in your face poem. 

The phrase “twist the sinews of thy heart” in stanza 3 alludes to rope-making, like the ropes used in siege machines or to restrain the cannons of Blake's time when on-board a ship. Stanza 4 describes a forge (the furnace where the tiger's brain was crafted) and other blacksmith's tools (hammers, chains, anvils). Next come the two lines in question: “When the stars threw down their spears / And water'd heaven with their tears”. The previous stanzas implied a process of technological advancement, starting with the Promethean theft of the fire, advancing to rope-making, and then using the flame for metallurgy. The Tiger, a machine of war so fierce that not even the stars themselves could stand against it, is the culmination. But in something of a twist ending, Blake reveals in the next two lines that the Tiger is not a human creation: “Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee?” The immortal hand or eye that dared frame the fearsome Tiger is the same benevolent creator who made the innocent lamb from “The Lamb”. This leaves one question: why, specifically, the stars? Because it helps set up the “twist ending”. The first four stanzas, describing the tiger's creation, allude to a human creator with the reference to Prometheus and the mentions of physical body parts, such as shoulders, hands, and feet, and human tools such as hammers, chains, and anvils. The stars are clearly beyond all human power, but lines 17 and 18 imply that a human might have created something capable of overcoming them until the “twist” in lines 19 and 20. (I'm putting “twist” in quotes because it's not terribly surprising to anyone who's read “The Lamb” and recognized the parallel structure of the two Songs books, though line 20 does contain the explicit callback to “The Lamb”.) This study help page says the two lines about the stars “may refer to the casting down of the angels after Satan rebelled against God”, which would make “stars” a metaphorical term for angels. This interpretation, when taken with lines 19 and 20, also helps set up the “twist”. Now we can interpret line 19, “Did he smile his work to see?”, as asking whether God, upon defeating the rogue angels, making them throw down their spears and weep as they were cast out of Heaven, smiled and took pleasure in his victory at war. In this light, line 20, “Did he who made the Lamb make thee?”, becomes an allusion to the dual nature of God, who, to the poet's disbelief, is both the loving, gentle being who made the innocent Lamb, and the vengeful, warlike being who made the vicious Tiger and smiled to see his defeated enemies weep.
