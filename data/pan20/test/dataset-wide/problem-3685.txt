I like to exercises while watching TV, and don't particularly want to get more home exercise equipment (like a bar or stand). What equipment I have is mostly stuff my wife has used for pilates and physical therapy. I have small dumbbells up to 10 pounds, a yoga strap, a balance board and an inflatable exercise/stability ball. I usually do jumping jacks, pushups, crunches, various core/leg exercises, etc., but I'm looking specifically for exercises which would be useful in training for indoor rock climbing (mostly biceps and lat exercises). I've tried: 

In other words, high intensity intervals led to increased fat loss, and increased some measures of insulin sensitivity. Here's a link to a few more studies, with promising results. That said, HIIT can be quite difficult, probably more difficult than standard cardio or many types of strength training. So while I'd recommend trying HIIT, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good: the best exercise is the exercise you do. Giving up on an exercise program burns 0 calories. Another aspect to consider is ancillary benefits. IMHO, improving strength and flexibility will make you feel better faster than cardio or HIIT. Strength training can improve pain of various sorts (especially back pain) and make it easier to start other kinds of exercise programs. 

Does putting weight on stomach and then hardening abs, helps in building abs? was doing some excercise in which i had to keep weight on my stomach before carrying with hands. 

I was doing decline bench press with dumb bells, and after exercise i put dumbbell on my chest and tried to lift my body but middle back felt pain middle of thoracic , my body was not lifted enough for hip extension muscles to be activated, so why I got pain. Which muslce got activated in back wrongly? Was not abs supposed to lift my body initially? 

I am doing dumb bell pullover as shown in excercise Except that i lie down completly on bench, when I bring DB up i kinda feel twitch around my delts , is it normal , does shoulder also involve in this one? 

What is difference b/n walking fast and running, which different muscles get activated are they different for both? I am asking cause I found my calves getting tightened more while walking fast while running does not cause this? 

Small changes in a flux of 6Kg/day can change your weight considerably. I've been tracking my weight for almost a year in a similar manner to you, and I find that the day after I go running, I frequently lose up to 2KG or around 2.5% of body mass! I then proceed to gain all that back over the next two days, and I'm back approximately where I started. My theory is that I'm depleting/replenishing my glycogen stores, which take up several times their weight in water, though other factors are presumably at work. In any case, daily fluctuations of 2Kg are in no way uncommon for me, and they're probably unavoidable. Walker suggests using a (smoothed) moving average to factor out daily fluctuations, and only look at the trend line, which has worked well for me. 

Stay away from antioxidant vitamins, at least C and E. There is a study from 2009, suggesting that vitamin C and E supplementation negate some of the beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity of exercise. Also linked from that post is another paper showing that vitamin C supplementation decreases endurance gains from exercise. 

When doing wrist curls or reverse one should dumbbell should move in plane perpendicular to ground or should it follow normal curved path as ulnar is shorter so weight moves toward ulnar side naturally. Which form is perfect? 

How important is angle in inclined chest fly, i found that if angle is low chest fly become more difficult and my biceps also get engaged but if angle is high near 90 than more pressure in chest? this one to be clear I am talking abt elbow angle not bench, while my humerus arm is parallel to ground while forearm is making an angle at elbow. 

I was doing this inclined curl source What i found that i could curl 25 pound with normal curl but with incline curl I can do only half of that, what is reason for decrease in strength ? 

I am doing this excercise for back. But what I felt was that my biceps were getting more tensed than my back, what is I am doing wrong? P.S. my trainer is worst, dont teach much , but office gym so I have to cope. 

Yes there are muscles between your ribs. They're called the intercostal muscles, though "soreness in ribs" might also be caused by soreness in your pectoralis minor (which connects to the front of the rib cage) or your serratus anterior (which connect your back to the side of your rib cage). A good hint that it's muscle soreness instead of connective tissue soreness is that muscle soreness usually feels good to massage, while tendon/ligament/joint soreness does not. The main use of the intercostal muscles is in opposing the diaphragm in breathing, but they're used in lots of movements. I get rib soreness after doing planks for a long period, so I suspect that is the main source of the soreness (a pushup being a like plank++). I would guess that the reason that your intercostal muscles are sore is because they are being used to hold the rib cage rigid, while forces are being transmitted between the serratus, pectoralis minor and rectus abdiminous. Dynamic tension between these muscles (and many others) lets your back stay flat and rigid while you're doing planks or pushups, but since a lot of the force is transmitted through the rib cage, your intercostal muscles contract and get stretched as you go through the movements. Like any other muscles after a working/stretching them, they get sore. It's probably especially noticeable since you do very few exercises which exercise your ribs. Here's a video showing the main muscle groups used in pushups, and here's an animation showing them in action. Hopefully you can see the stresses put on the rib cage. Pushups are really great exercises precisely because (if done properly) they strengthen so many different muscle groups (even ones you were unaware you had!). This is also one of the problems with Nautilus machines for strength training: by isolating muscles you miss out on strengthening small stabilizing muscles like the intercostal muscles and you can end up with big muscles but not genuine strength (and an increased risk of injury). I find that stretching my rib cage can help with soreness (though stretching beforehand or immediately after doesn't do very much). For soreness from pushups, my ribs tend to get more sore on the sides of my body, and a good stretch for that is the side angle pose from yoga. Finally, it's interesting that you get rib soreness after situps. I haven't had that experience, though situps are also complex exercises which use a lot of different muscles groups. Perhaps another answerer can go into that in more detail. There are a ridiculously enormous number of muscles in your back and shoulders. Planks are really complicated exercises. 

I am able to do dumb bell curl with 25 pound but if I don't do exercise for 3 weeks, i am still able to curl 25 pound but now with pain afterwards, i am assuming hypertrophy, This repeat hypertrophy y loss of muscle and gain of muscle ,Will it help muscle easy hypertrophy in future? 

Why it is beneficial or harmful to rotate my arm at top, if i dont rotate will it impinge any muscle or nerve? 

what is point of cross body hammer curl , aren't they same as hammer curl work same muscle, is their any benefit except tat they can carry more weight ? 

I have experienced two injuries: one doing bent over dumb bell row like this I got injured when my elbow left contact with my torso and flared up outside and got sharp pain in my shoulder. Other one while doing chest bench press, same scenario when my elbows flaired up. Why my shoulder is getting injured by my flaring of elbows? I do know that flaring is wrong movement, but is there any exercise which will strengthen my shoulder muscle which is getting affected by my flaring up elbow? 

A great place to start would be watching this young woman's youtube videos. She started out in a similar place to you (not knowledgeable about nutrition, overweight her whole life, ~330Lb, etc.), and has lost approximately 180 pounds over the course of a few years. Many of her videos contain extremely practical and specific advice, and her story is pretty inspirational. I think the most important thing she did was research losing weight for 4 months before starting on her weight loss plan. When she started, she knew pretty much what to expect, and was motivated to continue tweaking her plan as some things worked, and some didn't. I've read a lot about losing weight, and lost around 50 pounds in the last year. I don't think anyone but you can figure out a diet/exercise routine that will work for you. You need to find a set of dietary changes and ways to introduce exercise into your life that will lead to long-term changes. I can recommend a few things that worked for me, but they may not all work for you. I'm sure there are things that will work for you that no one here has listed. Experimentation is key. I'd suggest trying out the ones that sound appealing or manageable (especially the first one), and go from there. 

I have a exam which involves lots of writing 50 pages 3 hr , nine times in 6 days. I can increase my speed by simply writing practice, but is there any Gym exercise so that my writing muscles will be stronger and enduring? 

I saw this exercise and i cant remember where but it is a chest exercise, You lie down on floor, put dumbbell on your chest, grab it firmly with both hands in middle and raise it to top and them back again to chest and so on. I this exercise legitimate and is it effective for chest? 

Why reverse wrist curl is difficult as compared to wrist curl, I recently started training my wrists and I find it, are muscles for reverse wrist curl weaker by nature? 

I am doing shoulder shrugs, I can do 66 pounds, but that is max weight available. My question is can i use barbell like dumbbells and do side shrugs or does weight being far away from center will affect exercise. In barbell weights are far away from center hence more torque while with dumb bell less torque so would not it be hard to do shrugs with barbell 

In the book The Science of Yoga, William Broad discusses this in detail. My summary: for measures of cardiovascular fitness, Yoga is inferior to aerobic exercise. Indeed a small study of Yoga instructors (who do enormous amounts of yoga) found them to be roughly equivalent in measures of cardiovascular health (VO2 Max, etc) to someone who jogs 3-4 hours per week. Yoga is also inferior to weight training for gaining strength. Not really too surprising: exercises designed to specifically target certain ends are superior to flexibility exercises. However yoga does have significant benefits. He discusses studies showing that yoga can improve spinal health and treat back pain (one theory being that flexing the spine oxygenates the intervertebral discs, which may not get moved much in a sedentary lifestyle). It reduces stress hormones, may increase testosterone levels in men and various miscellaneous small benefits. The main large benefits seem to come in treating shoulder or back injuries. Personally, I do all three: yoga, weights and cardio. Of the three yoga is the most fun, so I'd say give it a try. The poses generally feel good, help with my back pain. It may not be superior to other forms of exercise on most measures, but it's worth doing for its own sake. 

When I am walking i observed I have two mode, in one I am walking normal way with all my body felling no tension, other one is in which my torso fill bit of stiff, it is feeling like walking by someone forcing me. Which muscles are getting worked out in both scenario? I hope other people also experience same. 

I am doing bicep curls standard nothing special, But I don't feel muscle soreness in middle of biceps, i fell it near lower end of it, near elbow one. is it normal or am I doing curls wrong? 

There are number of articles saying some hip flexors inflexibility cause stress on spine and hence cause pain in lower back due to crunches or leg lift or even squats. What can i do as exercise which will prevent my back from injury due to performance of these exercise? please suggest safe exercise which wont need an expert to do correctly. As i understand hip flexor and extensor weakness is responsible for Psoas major activation, but to strengthen flexor extensor more pressure will come on Psoas. It is becoming a catch39 situation.
