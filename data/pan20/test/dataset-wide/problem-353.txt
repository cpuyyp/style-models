Yes, but not by attacking fleets. As others have shown, he simply can't do enough to stop them. Instead, after demonstrating his invincibility: I am here to hear proposals for a reasonable peace. If you can agree, fine. If you can't I will decide the peace terms--and attack the government of any side that does not go along with them. If somebody doesn't comply he flies through their capital at very high speed. If the replacement government is still stupid he flies through at even higher speed. Sooner or later the people will select a reasonable government. 

Expanding upon Tmartin's answer: He did a fine job of showing that the squirrel is the animal of choice for this mission. However, the question also asked about delivery. A catapult is not the right choice here, you are going to have an awful lot of g force at launch. Rather, your launcher should be a trebuchet. Since it launches via counterweight rather than tension there's no huge acceleration spike. Furthermore, you don't want to just pile squirrels on it. First, there will be a lot of hard landings that result in dead squirrels and also your range will be severely limited. The same high drag that protects a falling squirrel also limits how far you can throw one. Instead, lets make some squirrel holders. Take a string and tie it to the squirrel--this needs to be something they can chew through reasonably quickly. Now, take a piece of paper and wrap the squirrel's face so it can't chew. The string is wrapped around this paper but not tied. The string is then tied to a larger piece of paper. This paper is wrapped around the squirrel and a decently heavy stone. A ribbon is fastened to the paper and wrapped around this whole thing, not tied and some ribbon is left loose. A bunch of these are piled on the trebuchet in a stone-down orientation. You can have only one layer. When launched the wind grabs the loose end of the ribbon and starts unwinding things. Once the paper starts to unwind the stone falls free, the paper causes a lot of drag and rest of the assembly quickly unwraps. While the squirrel might be a bit dizzy from the unwinding the rotation quickly stops once it's fully unwound. The squirrel won't like being tethered and will quickly chew off the string. Experimentation (dead squirrels will suffice) will tell you exactly how big and long to make the various parts to ensure it opens as late in the flight as possible to get maximum range. While a piece of paper edge on at first glance doesn't look like much of a parachute it's a lot more effective than one would think. Back in my model rocketry days we recovered a lot of light rockets with a strip of crepe paper rather than a parachute. For light enough rockets it was the method of choice because it was basically impervious to malfunctions other than a failure of the tether itself. 

Another approach, not quite so certain: Engineer a few diseases, airborne and with two phases: The first phase has only mild symptoms, the second is deadly. Perhaps something like aggressively going after the bone marrow. The diseases must be very different so that someone who happens to be immune to one isn't immune to the others. Make sure at least one induces paranoid schizophrenia as a symptom. Once the diseases are causing considerable damage take credit in the name of major power blocks. This must come with reasonable proof of having done so but you don't need to prove that you really are the power blocks. The objective is to get those paranoids in power to use their military might against the perpetrators. While it's unlikely you'll get a 100% kill this way you don't need to be perfect--kill enough and the survivors won't be able to recover. You'll want to ensure a minimum of resources are available to them. Incendiary time bombs in as many cities as possible timed to go off in the dry season after things have fallen apart will help. 

There's virtually no upper limit to what we could transport by water. If he floats you just tow him. If he sinks you attach floatation to him until he floats then you tow him. The capacity of a ship doesn't enter into this as you can bring a lot of ships into the picture. Grab the oceangoing tugs, grab the icebreakers (they're way overpowered for their size), grab the major warships of the world (warships are built to go fast, they are likewise overpowered for their size.) You don't need to be able to go fast, just fast enough to overcome any ocean currents. 5mph is enough to overcome any sustained ocean current. 

Expect a common cause of death to be suicide bombing. If you're going to die anyway why not take out some great evil in the world? 

Related to WernerCD's answer: It's a safety measure. The first thing that happens when you dock at a space station is a cable is connected to the control port that allows the station to control all external manifestations of the ship (engines, airlocks, extendable antennas, transmitters etc) to ensure the ship does nothing that could harm the station. 

Harry Harrison's matter transmitter stories. They are paired--if you capture one that gives you a portal to the enemy base. Sapper throws a two stage bomb, the initial charge is conventional--destroy the transmitter. Stage 2 is nuclear--you just blew up the enemy base, wherever it might be in the universe. 

It would be exceedingly unlikely but it could happen. Combine hot, dry, windy weather with a fire in something like a refinery. Under normal conditions the fire brigades will stomp on any fire but if the fire gets too big too fast they will be overwhelmed. At that point a fire could get out of control. Yes, modern cities are far less combustible than the cities of old but that won't stop a big enough fire. 

1) Lets look at the Honor Harrington universe (David Weber). Normal-space drive performance is inversely related to the size of the ship. In his universe this curve is fairly shallow (it lets small warships run away from bigger ones) lets suppose it's much steeper. Considerable in-space maneuvering is required to use your FTL drive. Your space-warping normal-space drive can produce 100,000g / the cube of the distance to the farthest point on your ship in meters. (Thus it's linear to the volume of space that must be warped.) To use your FTL drive you must be moving at a Lorentz factor of at least 1 (from special relativity--you must have energy of motion as great as your rest mass--.866c) relative to the hyperspace you are going to enter. A courier ship that is 1 meter in radius reaches jump speed 402 seconds after clearing the atmosphere. An explorer in a ship that is 4 meters in radius takes over 7 hours to jump. A small freighter that is 10 meters in radius takes over 4 1/2 days to jump. A large freighter 50 meters in radius takes over 19 months to jump and goes over a light year during that time--in an area of dense stars it might not even use it's FTL drive. 2) Now lets add to this pirates. The space warping is quite unfriendly to locating your targets so long range weapons are impractical. You have to get up close and personal to hit and to actually pack enough punch to defeat things like anti-laser ablation layers you need quite a bit of power--and powerful lasers are big. This makes the best defense be to make your ship smaller than the laser needed to stop you. You will end up with a universe divided between little craft that sprint between stars and some that haul big stuff and have the weaponry to shoot it out with the pirates while plodding between the stars. There will be some intermediate range craft that haul large but urgent cargoes but that's a risky realm to be in. 

Lets add some chemicals to the paper. Semi-randomly (never the first or last sheet, never both chemicals in the same ream of paper) and at a low frequency. Chemical A: Inert. Enough heat converts A to C. Chemical B: Inert. Enough heat converts B to D. C + D + pressure causes a slow reaction that produces crystals of E. E has a very low ignition temperature and can be triggered by friction. Result: A ream of paper can never be made to do evil--this will make this sabotage very hard to detect. However, when you move the printed materials around the danger arises. You put a C paper in a folder and also a D paper. This state is still safe as the paper is merely sitting there. The danger arises when you stack up those folders, now you have the pressure and E is formed. Leave that stack alone for a while (storage) and it becomes dangerous. Now, when someone messes with it (say, opens the file drawer it's stored in) it may be triggered. It's possible the crystal is buried too deeply and goes out due to a lack of oxygen, but if it's close enough to the edge you may get a slowly smoldering fire, in time this can turn into a big fire. CoC will in time figure out that the fires are sabotage but how will they trace it to the paper? Even if the identify E there's no E in the paper, they'll be looking elsewhere for where the E is coming from. (You said some handwavium is acceptable. I don't know if suitable chemicals exist.) 

Simple: An infected gets on a ship. The ship sets course for a safe place but the zombies kill the crew. The autopilot continues on course until the ship runs aground at it's destination. 

No. Suppose you ended all current wars, what would happen? There are scumbags out there who would demand concessions for not going to war. If you don't cave in there will be war, if you do there will be more demanding more concessions and you'll end up in a situation where they can't all be met. 

I would be very surprised if there was any effect. The bullets won't care, they aren't being propelled with atmospheric oxygen in the first place. I do understand the threat of hot brass and the stuff that comes out the barrel (watch a gun in very slow motion--there's some fire along with the hot gasses) but if the environment is such that a minor ignition source can set it off I would think it would likely have burned from a lightning storm. If things were tinder dry it would be more dangerous to use a gun then than in similar conditions now but you don't have that sort of situation in the first place. 

By giving up a bit of standard of living you will have no problem supporting however much of the US population you can get behind your barrier. Cut greatly back on meat, if necessary supplement with stuff from a chemical plant. 

You're not going to get into space without the superpowers knowing. Remember, our satellites saw the SAM launch that brought down the plane over the Ukraine. A SAM uses a much smaller rocket than anything that can put a person in orbit. Another poster suggested spaceplanes--while a spaceplane can get a lot of velocity as an air-breather without showing up on anybody's satellites they eventually have to turn to rocketry and that's still going to leave a fiery trail for the satellites to see. A supergun was also suggested. Even if you can overcome the various problems with using guns for atmospheric launch you're still going to have a huge thermal signature as your space capsule smashes through the lower atmosphere. While I don't know if the satellites will note this I certainly wouldn't expect to get away with it. Those are military satellites, they're designed to look for disguised missile launches. A launch loop avoids the thermal signature but there's no hiding construction of that size. Besides, a launch loop won't even fit in Poland. Thus there's no stealthy way into space. The only way you'll be able to pull it off is to hide who is doing it. Build a submersible facility that serves both as the final assembly building and the launch platform. Everyone will know that somebody has a stealthy space program, they just won't know who. Eventually the US will figure it out, though--sooner or later you're going to launch too close to a lurking fast attack sub and it will find you. Once it gets close enough the game is up--even if by some miracle you evaded the sub they'll get pictures and a sound signature and will be able to match that up to something they see docking in Poland. Pre-collapse I would say that Russia would have also figured it out, these days I don't know what their submarine patrols are like.
