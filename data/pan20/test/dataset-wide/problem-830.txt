No, the sun and all other stars do not have the same composition and density within them. The composition varies with depth. Most stars overall composition reflects the interstellar medium from which they form. Convection, settling and nuclear processes then lead to layers of different elements at differing depths. Fusion occurs at the core of our sun (where pressure and temperature are greatest) therefore there is a greater abundance of Helium at this depth (through conversion of hydrogen). Other stars that have entered the red giant phase will also have many more heavier elements. Very late stage stars are thought to fuse these elements progressively, leading to layers of decreasing atomic number elements stacked on top of each other. Convection can also lead to mixing of elements between layers. The diagram below shows theoretically how these convective layers differ over a range of stellar masses 

I assume you mean contraction, as opposed to the current expansion that we see today due to dark energy. Again this would be unfeasible due to the reasons outlined above, and if contraction was to proceed to it's conclusion, i.e. a singularity like the Big Bang, then no information from this universe could be carried through that singularity, even if there was another universe on the other side. 

There are around 2 trillion galaxies in the currently observable universe according to the latest estimates, obtained by integrating theoretical galaxy stellar mass functions above $10^{6} M_{\odot}$ between $0 \leqslant z \leqslant 8$. It's difficult to get a precise number for the total observed galaxies as the results from new surveys are being released all the time, and updated analysis of legacy data is revealing more galaxies. For example, the latest SDSS data release identified close to 200 million galaxies, whilst the ongoing Dark Energy Survey seeks to identify around 300 million galaxies. LSST, in Chile, will observe close to 20 billion galaxies, an order of magnitude greater than anything before it. However, all of these surveys operate up to relatively low redshifts. Probing to higher redshifts requires bigger, preferably space based telescopes, and much longer exposure times. As such, the high redshift universe has been poorly documented. Our understanding of galaxy formation at high redshift is not as complete as at low redshift, and so we may be under- or over-estimating the number of galaxies at this epoch. A vague upper limit: we've observed less than 0.01% of all currently observable galaxies. 

It is thought likely that black holes would produce Hawking radiation and evaporate. We can't yet describe the end products of an evaporating black hole, and space is too warm to detect Hawking radiation anywhere. There are some recent new ideas regarding complementarity that are difficult to reach a decision on as well. Hawking seems to be pulling away from the black hole concept recently. I don't know what to make of that. Regarding particle colliders: every few years some team gets into the general news cycle with an announcement about detections that resemble particular models of black hole behavior. Miscommunication tends to produce journalism about real black holes being created. Now there may be developing interest in the possibility of the galactic core lighting up. Maybe that would lead to better journalism. 

If Earth were still inhabited four billion years from now, it is extremely unlikely that Earth would fall into a star from Andromeda. 

First, note that by the time Andromeda is close enough for collisions with wandering stars to become a concern, Earth's average temperature will have changed significantly, and the planet will be unrecognizable. When Sol is 8.5 billion years old, it will still have hydrogen available for fusion, but as it fuses it contracts and expands differentially. The contraction causes hydrogen fusion to become more favorable, so that Sol will have 50% greater power output ($6 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{W}$) and 3% greater effective temperature ($6000\ \mathrm{K}$). Fusion also causes Sol to lose mass at a prodigious rate (currently $4 \times {10}^9 \mathrm{kg/s}$); it will release $6 \times {10}^{43} \mathrm{J}$ from fusion, which corresponds to $7 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{kg}$. That is about one hundred Earth masses of sunlight but only $1 \over 3000$ the mass of Sol. Gravitation with Earth decreases proportionally, so Earth's orbit might on average expand $3000\ \mathrm{km}$ per billion years. Other gravitational effects might change Earth's average distance by as much as $6 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$, 4‰ of an astronomical unit. Expansion of Sol's outer layers due to reduced gravitation will increase its radius by 20%, $3 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$. Thus Earth will receive nearly 50% more power as well. The energy balance of Earth wrt Sol gives the expected surface temperature: $$ \begin{align} \bar{a} = & 0.7 & \small\text{(Average absorption)} \\ P_p = & 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(Average solar flux incident on Earth at present)} \\ P_f = & P_p \cdot 1.5 \approx 2000\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(In future)} \\ \sigma = & 5.670373 \times {10}^{-8}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4} & \small\text{(Stefan-Boltzmann constant)} \\ \\ T_p^4 = & \frac{\bar{a} P_p}{4 \sigma} \\ \approx & \frac{0.7 \cdot 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2}}{2.268149 \times {10}^{-7}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4}} \\ \approx & 4.2 \times {10}^9\ \mathrm{K^4} \\ T_p \approx & 250\ \mathrm{K} \\ \\ T_f \approx & T_p \cdot {1.5}^{1/4} \approx T_p \cdot 1.11 \\ \approx & 280\ \mathrm{K} \end{align} $$ Since the average surface temperature on Earth is not $-20\ \mathrm{°C}$ — it is $+15\ \mathrm{°C}$ and already around $8\ \mathrm{K}$ warmer than in an airless future — we can see the atmosphere has a significant role in retaining heat. Assuming increasing cooling needs do not lead to the atmosphere retaining more heat, the average surface temperature can be expected to rise to $+50\ \mathrm{°C}$. The average temperature of Antarctica is now $240\ \mathrm{K}$ in winter and $270\ \mathrm{K}$ in summer. These can be expected to rise to $270\ \mathrm{K}$ (just below freezing) and $300\ \mathrm{K}$ (well above freezing) respectively, and this is a best-case scenario. Antarctica will melt. That will produce the largest component (60%) of sea level increase, in total around $100\ \mathrm{m}$. 

There are a finite number of currently observable galaxies due to the finite age of the universe and the speed of light. What fraction of these galaxies have we actually observed (by eye, telescope, etc.)? 

Zeilik's Introductory Astronomy and Astrophysics is worth investigating. It's more in depth than Kaufman & Freedman's Universe, mentioned in another answer, but requires a little more mathematical background such as basic calculus and trigonometry. I'd also recommend looking at online courses from providers such as Coursera, Khan Academy and edx (and here) for inspiration on how to structure such a course. 

The density increases as you move closer to the center of the star. Note how the density is less than that of water for up to half the sun's radius! 

Further details here on astronomical causes of average daytime variation, and here on Insolation, the solar radiation received at the top of the atmosphere and its effects on the energy received at ground level. 

Density waves cause the build up of galactic material in to spiral arms. An object does not have to stay in a spiral arm; it can join or leave it as the density wave passes through the galaxy. However, the likelihood of an object being in a spiral arm is greater. The shape of the arms does not relate to matter falling in; this is an illusion. Objects perform elliptical or near-circular orbits around the center of the galaxy. The origin of these density waves is not known conclusively, though there are many simulations that re-create the effect through satellite galaxy perturbations. 

Type 1a supernovae are used as standard candles. Are there other high energy cosmic events which can be used as standard candles. For example, collapse of neutron star into a black hole is also similar to type 1a. In a galaxy, there are far more white dwarfs(candidates of type 1a) compared to neutron stars(I read somewhere that our galaxy contains around 200 million of them). Also, the energy released in neutron star collapse is not in visible spectrum(I don't think so that is the criteria for "standard candles"). Are these the reasons that neutron star collapse is not qualified as another type of standard candle? 

Presence of liquid water on surface. Wind speed. (Very high wind speeds like on Uranus can make life impossible). Tectonic activities, active volcanoes, solid crust for us land dwellers. Magnetosphere. 

Most of the communication on Earth and to-fro Space takes place over low frequency visible, infrared, micro and radio wave spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum. The immediate benefits of using low frequency EM spectrum which I think of are as following: 

Gas giants like Jupiter consists mainly of Hydrogen and some Helium. If you gradually add mass to these planets then core temperatures will rise gradually and a stage will come where they will ignite like normal stars. Unlike white dwarfs where accretion of mass leads to type 1A supernova. 

Distance of planet from its host star. Is the planet in Goldie-lock zone? Atmospheric composition. Presence of Oxygen, Nitrogen, CO2, water vapors. Thick atmosphere can shield from radiation from host star. Mass of the planet. surface gravity. Is the planet tidally locked with its host star. Orbit of planet around its host star. Highly elliptical orbit can be a problem(just a guess). 

I am unaware of there being a single Helium line that is as prominent or useful as the 21cm line is for Hydrogen. The 21 cm line is due to a hyperfine transition in the 1s ground state of hydrogen. It is notable due to its strength, and also its usefulness for mapping neutral hydrogen in the universe, which is impossible in the optical since it is absorbed by neutral Hydrogen. It was in fact the first such spectral line observed in the radio part of the spectrum, and is so fundamental that the Pioneer and Voyager probes used the length of the transition as a time and distance unit on the plaques they carry, so that potential extraterrestrials could decode the messages. There are many more spectral lines in the radio from heavier elements, and a whole field dedicated to observing and understanding them: radio frequency spectroscopy. For Helium in particular, hyperfine lines can also be observed; the hyperfine transition of the $^3$He isotope has a wavelength ~4mm. The same isotope also emits a recombination line, where an electron recombines with an ion and falls to lower energy levels, emitting a photon in the process. The wavelengths of such recombination lines for Hydrogen like atoms (singly ionised in the case of Helium, so that it has a single electron) can be estimated using the Rydberg Formula: $$\nu = R_{m}c\left[\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{(n+\Delta n)^2}\right]$$ where $R_m$ is the reduced mass Rydberg constant, $n$ is the final state and $\Delta n$ is the change in state. Estimating the strengths of such lines is a little more complicated, but there are details here.
