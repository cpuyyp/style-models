This is somewhat sad, but I think (part of) what we've learned from the whole triangulated-vs-dg story is the following pseudo-statement: the bare category of functors Fun(D(X),D(Y)) is the wrong thing to take -- it should be replaced the category D(X x Y). There is a nice example, due to the usual Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland people (Example 6.5 in Caldararu's notes), which illustrates this perfectly. Thus, if you find something weird happening in Fun(D(X),D(Y)) you shouldn't be discouraged -- it's not your fault. Of course, there are big names in the field (Canonaco and Stellari to name two) who might disagree with my initial pseudo-statement. It really depends on what you care about. 

Maybe Asher Auel's thesis? But maybe it's still schemes, not sure! (but that thesis is still awesome) $URL$ 

Given a(n $\infty$-)category, there is a process called "stabilitazion" which spits out a stable $\infty$-category (as one can read about in either Higher Algebra or the nlab). The famous example is Spectra, which is the stabilization of Top (and I guess the various enhancements of derived categories, out of categories of modules). If I start instead with the plain old category of pointed sets, what is its stabilization? And if I start with finite pointed sets? 

I am trying to understand Remark 11.3 in Huybrechts's amazing book on derived categories (FM transforms in AG). He starts with smooth projective varieties $j\colon Y \subset X$ and aims to describe the local ext groups $\underline{Ext}^i(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y)$ in terms of $\wedge^i N$ where $N$ is the normal bundle of $Y$ in $X$. To describe this, he mentions a morphism $\wedge^k \underline{Ext}^1(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y) \to \underline{Ext}^k(j_* O_Y, j_* O_Y)$ which he calls cup product (or composition). 

Suppose I have three identically-distributed homogeneous continuous-time discrete state space Markov chains $X_1(t), X_2(t), X_3(t)$, $t\geq 0$. They evolve independently but share a common random variable $X_0$ as an initial condition. I let $$X_1=X_1(t_1), \ \ \ X_2=X_2(t_2), \ \ \ X_3=X_3(t_3)$$ for some times $t_1, t_2, t_3\geq 0$. I want to show that $$ I(X_1; X_2; X_3) \geq 0 $$ where $I$ is the multivariate mutual information (or information interaction) $$ I(A,B,C)= H(A,B,C) -H(A,B) - H(B,C) - H(A,C) + H(A) + H(B) + H(C) $$ where $H$ is the usual Shannon entropy. Background/Motivation There are well-known situations where $I(A;B;C)<0$, a famous one being if $A$ and $B$ are independent random variables, each $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$, and $C=AB$. But I conjecture that in the case I have described above $I(X_1;X_2;X_3)\geq 0$. I believe that the Markov chains being continuous-time and homogeneous is essential. The more general motivation is that I want to find very general situations where multivariate mutual information is non-negative. (One well-known example is if $A,B,C$ form a Markov chain.) 

There are quite a few people who have tried to generalize metrics to more than two variables. I once tried to track down all the references on this subject for a paper. Here are some: There is an extensive literature on 2-metrics, in which $d$ takes 3 arguments. This appears to have been introduced by Gahler. Here is a recent example with some references. What James Cranch mentions in his answer is (I think) originally due to Menger (K. Menger, Untersuchungen uber allgemeine Metrik, Math. Ann. 100.). Menger takes $d$ to be the volume of an $n$-simplex in Euclidean space. Then he tries to abstract away from that. (I can't read German so take this summary with a grain of salt.) Three recent papers that seek such generalizations are by Deza and Rosenberg (Small cones of $m$-hemimetrics), by Chepoi and Fichet (A note on three-way dissimilarities and their relationship with two-way dissimilarities), and by Warren ($n$-way metrics). My impression from all of these is that there is no one natural way to extend metrics to take more than 2 arguments. 

presumably the reason there is an equality in 3.25 instead of an isomorphism is that you don't want $V_K$ to be abstractly isomorphic to $W$, but you want them to be equivalent subschemes of $X_K$ (ie isomorphic in the category of pairs (scheme, embedding)). At least that's how I would interpret it, but I might be wrong. Also, take $X = P^N$. Saying that $W \subset X_K$ is defined over $k$ means precisely that you can find equations cutting out $X_K$ with coefficients in at most $k$. 

Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it. 

X and Y are proper and irreducible. As a double cover does not crush X to a point, it must be surjective. The fibres are then finite sets which implies that it is a finite morphism. Finite morphisms are affine. Affine morphisms do not have higher direct image (this is just the relative version of the theorem which says that affine schemes do not have higher cohomology with coefficients in quasi-coherent sheaves). 

What you call the Euler discretization is sometimes called the Euler-Maruyama discretization. There is a lot of literature about its convergence properties. One place to look is the classic book by Kloeden and Platen (Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations). Another is Milstein and Tretyakov (Stochastic Numerics for Mathematical Physics). A very convenient and readable introduction is the paper by Des Higham $URL$ 

It seems unlikely that your problem is going to have a solution in the generality you've described but here goes. There are two approaches you could try. (1) Discretize the partial derivatives using finite differences on the grid. At every point on the grid your PDE will give you a nonlinear equation. You will have a total of $n^2$ equations in $n^2$ unknowns. But each equation will only contain a small number of unknowns. You can use a variant Newton's method to solve these equations. But you have to work with the restrictions that you probably don't want to code up the Jacobian for the system, and you could not use a direct method to calculate the solution even if you did. I would recommend looking at a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method. (2) Exploit the method of characteristics. Rewrite your equation as $$ (cz+d) z_x - (az+b) z_y = 0. $$ This gives characteristic equations $$ \frac{dx}{dt}=cz+d, \ \ \ \frac{dy}{dt}=a z+b, \ \ \ \frac{dz}{dt}= 0. $$ There are numerical methods for solving nonlinear hyperbolic equations exploiting characteristics. Sethian and Vladimirsky have a nice one. Your problem does not quite fit into their scheme but their paper might help give you ideas. So, if you problem does have a solution, one of these might work. I would expect (1) to be more robust than (2), but also more expensive. 

I don't know of a uniform way to prove it for all curves. For elliptic curves it follows from Hodge theory and for the rest it's a consequence of the Bondal-Orlov theorem. It's all explained in Huybrechts's excellent book on Fourier-Mukai transforms. 

I hope this is well known, I just could not work it out myself. Say I have a variety X (smooth and projective over C is my usual setup) with a smooth subvariety Z. Let f: BL_Z(X) --> X be the blowup of X with centre Z and let E be the exceptional. 

The following is apparently a theorem of Serre (which can be found in his FAC paper, although I haven't spotted it $URL$ Let's say that a graded module is torsion if it's zero for all degrees high enough. Let R be a commutative graded ring generated in dimension one. Denote Gr the category of graded R-modules and Tors the subcategory of torsion modules (which is a Serre subcategory). Then the quotient category Gr/Tors is equivalent (through the ~ construction) to the category of quasi-coherent modules on Proj R. I believe that when R is noetherian then this equivalence restricts to one between finitely generated graded modules and coherent modules. (presumably there is also a relative version of this -- but I am quite allergic to Proj so I'm not going to go any further on this) 

I'm looking for a reference for the following fact (which I believe to be true and should be easy for people who understand how spectral sequences arise from filtrations).
