Answer: Not much The Milky Way's central black hole (BH) masses about 5 million suns, while the galaxy masses 100 billion to a trillion suns. Consequently, the central BH is pretty much irrelevant to the dynamics of stellar orbits except very close to the center. But what do you mean by "the black hole dies"? Do you mean evaporates through Hawking radiation? (That's the only process we know of that can do away with a BH, and it is so slow that the galaxy will long since have disappeared before the central black hole evaporates.) 

This balance changes. As the universe expands, the density of matter (dark and normal) varies as the inverse 3rd power of the size of the universe. (Matter stays the same and the volume expands as the cube of the radius.) But the density of dark energy stays constant, since it is a property of empty space. The density of radiation is proportional to the inverse 4th power of the radius, because not only does the increased volume dilute the radiation like it dilutes the matter, but also the radiation gets red-shifted, contributing an extra power of the radius. (Incidentally, that means that the fraction of the total mass-energy of the universe in radiation decreases with time, and is estimated presently to be 1000:1 matter:radiation.) So radiation seems simply to be too small to matter. 

Neutron stars are one of the possible end products of the evolution of stars greater than around 8 solar masses. If you start out with a close binary pair of these fairly massive stars -- not common, but not rare, either -- the more massive star will evolve to a red giant and tides (or even friction) in the extended envelope will pull them closer together. The red giant will eventually supernova and may produce a neutron star. Later the originally less massive star will do the same, sometimes resulting in a very close binary pair of neutron stars. (Or sometimes a neutron star/white dwarf pair.) The close binary will emit significant orbital energy in gravitational waves, causing the neutron stars to spiral towards each other and, eventually to coalesce. The reason they don't just sit there orbiting stably like planets do is because they and very massive and very close together, and consequently orbit each other very rapidly. Since the intensity of gravitational wave emission depends on the radiating body's mass and its acceleration, close neutron star pairs can radiate away their orbital energy in "mere" hundreds of millions of years. The exact same effect happens for planets, but because of the lower mass and lower acceleration, the time to radiate significant energy is far longer than the current age of the universe. 

There is no specific answer to this -- anything from "just sits there" to flys away at high speed is possible. It all depends on the symmetry of the supernova (SN) explosion. Extensive modelling shows that the explosions can be quite asymmetrical, and if they are the gravitational waves created can give the new black hole (BH) quite a kick. If the explosion is relatively symmetric, the new BH can more or less stay right where it was formed. Note that if the exploding star is a member of a close binary, the SN explosion will usually give the companion star a high velocity. Before the explosion, a close pair may be rotating around their joint center of mass at 1000 kps. When one star goes SN, it blows most of its mass right out of the system and high velocity. This doesn't change the velocity of the companion star which suddenly is no longer bound and has escape velocity from the star system -- so it more-or-less goes flying off in a straight line at its orbital velocity. Some of the runaway stars discovered by Gaia are probably companion stars to SNs. 

First, I'd like to point out and commend @user83692435's reply which came first and is correct. Expanding on it: The image of a virtual particle/anti-particle pair being created and then one of the pair being swallowed by the event horizon leaving the other as real is an analogy which provides a picture of what is happening, but is definitely not correct. Popularizers continue to use it because what is really going on is extremely complex and not easily explainable in words. (And I won't try!) But here's a link to a technical paper on the subject. But perhaps the most telling point against the simple explanation is that Hawking radiation doesn't come from the event horizon which the analogy requires, but from the space outside it! A second point against the Hawking analogy is that the event horizon is enormously deep in the black hole's potential well. For a particle or photon to escape the BH (which Hawking radiation must) it must be created with enough additional energy to escape the BH -- and a BH can be thought of an an object with an escape velocity greater than the speed of light. Wimpy little virtual particles which lost their partner to the BH would never make it out. If you'd like to dig a bit deeper, I recommend Sabine Hossenfelder's blog Backreaction which has a long post with many links to further information. Backreaction is one of the best of the frontier physics popularizing blogs going these days, in significant part because Hossenfelder is an active researcher and a good writer. 

There are a bunch of ways. The simplest is triangulation. Consider a transit of Mercury or Venus, when the planet gets between the Earth and the Sun. If you observe the planet's path across the face Sun from two different places, measuring the chords across the Sun's disk and the timings, using no more than trigonometry, you can get an accurate distance to the Sun. Here's a good discussion of the method on the Physics SE (It's worth noting that it is easy to measure the distance to, say, Mars in terms of the ratio of the distance to Mars compared with the Earth-Sun distance, than it is to measure the Earth-Sun distance in miles. Hence the Astronomical Unit. We accurately knew many astronomical distances in AU before we knew the length of the AU equally accurately.) 

Under General Relativity (GR) alone, a Black Hole's (BH's) event horizon is a point of no return -- anything that passes through the event horizon is lost and gone forever, and nothing comes out. Hence, under GR alone, BHs are utterly black and don't have a temperature at all. This is why the absorption of radiation (or anything else) by a BH doesn't raise its temperature -- it just gets swallowed up and lost. (It's mass, angular momentum and charge do remain, but that's all -- see the No Hair Theorem.) (Note: The accretion disk that surrounds a BH can be very hot indeed, but that's another thing entirely.) Stephen Hawking discovered that applying quantum mechanics to BHs showed that BHs would emit a random spray of radiation, and that that radiation was precisely what a black body would emit -- black body radiation. This is called Hawking radiation. Black body radiation is simply the thermal emission of a perfect absorber of radiation, and leads to the inescapable conclusion that a BH does have a non-zero temperature. Interestingly, Hawking's analysis showed that the effective temperature of the BH is inversely proportional to its mass and that solar-mass BHs (which are the smallest for which we have actual evidence) would have a temperature of about 0.00000006 K. Kinda cold, but still not zero. Note that, unintuitively, a solar mass BH get colder as it absorbs radiation. Because any radiation (or anything else) it absorbs increases its mass, and since higher mass BHs are colder, the more energy you dump into one, the colder it gets!
