The really big implication of this would be losing randomness in such universe. Everything would be perfectly predicable, down to the subatomic level. (Assuming by Newtonian universe you also mean quantum mechanics do not exist.) There would be no transistors and all computers would be based on some other sort of method to compute numbers (whether digital or analogue). If people in such universe would be able to build a supercomputer that can approximate the universe, they would find out that they lack free will and consciousness, since everything will be predictable and everything in the past would be known, just by running a simulation. See $URL$ and $URL$ both principles are fundamental to how our universe work. Basically it is very hard to say if everything would change, as you removed a huge chunk of the physics in our universe. We can only hypothesize, and we can't even know if such universe would exist or stay stable. 

This is a bit of a stretch, but it is hard to define "medieval technology". A lot of principles we know today were known in the medieval era, but no one practiced them, either caused by a lack of interest (i.e. A merchant would be able to earn money and not starve, but physicist that creates useless rolling ball would starve) or a lack of resources (literacy rates were very very low). If people had the time and energy, really the cities wouldn't be that different from now, since humans created very large and complex architecture since a long time BC (i.e. pyramids, stonehenge, cathedrals, Colosseum, etc). One of the factors preventing or rather inhibiting the medieval times from building skyscrapers were the lack of population. Why build higher when you can easily build further? So basically, anything is possible, except structures based on modern technology (plastics, aluminium, reinforced steel, tempered glass, carbon composites, etc) 

Government control of all food. Without sufficient food an additional child cannot be kept alive. If every person goes to a government controlled distribution point every time they need food, the government has precise control over how much each person receives. If you want sufficient food for a new child you have to request it. If your child wasn't approved they won't give you food for them. Perhaps they would instead take the child and raise them as a ward of the state. If this pattern has been long established it may be culturally ingrained. People teach their children this is how it works. Everyone knows that if you try to have children without government approval they will be taken. If the past circumstances that alarmed the Elders included severe reduction of the places on the planet that will grow food, the government might have easily taken control of all of these areas. Perhaps the staple food isn't even grown at all but instead is a synthetic production. 

Forgive me science if this is too absurd. Disperse into the atmosphere molecules with 2 characteristics: 

Now when a bullet is fired the air pushes back and smashes the bullet then solidifies into a small ball which falls to the ground. You might even have it decay in some days or weeks back into the first element so the supply in the atmosphere stays more or less constant. You probably have to invent a couple exotic chemical elements to make this work. 

Sound waves are propagated through a medium, wherever there is a medium, there will be sound. However if you can create some kind of phenomena on the planet that generates a sound noise level high enough so any practical communication would be impossible, it would work. If the planet produces white noise at around 100dB or produces a single sound frequency at the max atmospheric pressure, that would hinder the use of sound to communicate. The explanation for the latter proposal is that in order for the waves to be called sound, they need to oscillate, just like an AC wave. If there is already a one frequency that touches the minimum pressure, any other higher frequency would need to go to a negative pressure in order to manifest as sound, which is impossible. Imagine creating a wave that touches the top of an aquarium, and the lower part touches the bottom part of the aquarium, if you wanted to add a smaller wave within that big wave, you would need the water to go above and below the aquarium walls. In fact, water can go higher and over the open aquarium, just like pressure, but a vacuum is the lowest pressure you can obtain. However, I am not sure what that would do to humans, since we know that prolonged exposure to loud sounds is very unhealthy, and I am pretty sure sound at the maximum atmospheric pressure would be similar to periodically generating shockwaves, which would kill any living organism caught in it. 

A planet composed mostly of gems and precious metals Given the right composition this could effectively be a harsh "desert planet" very difficult to survive. Astronomers have theorized about planets made largely of diamond. To explain observations of some planets oceans of liquid diamond have been proposed. An exoplanet whose clouds are composed of corundum has been observed (sapphire and ruby are variants of corundum). The asteroid Eros seems to contain more precious metals than ever excavated in history. Other asteroids contain an abundance of precious metals. Scenario: A spacefaring civilization is dying. They identify a distant planet as their only hope. It contains the elements for life in extremely scarce quantities. The natural composition is high in gems: solid, liquid, and atmospheric. Several asteroid collisions in the past have brought massive amounts of precious metals to the surface. They dispatch a fleet of lifeboats in a last ditch effort to survive. The travelers arrive centuries later. Their home planet is long dead. They land and establish colonies. Life is a struggle every day due to bleak natural conditions. The gems and metals that dominate their terrain have virtually no value; they're as common as dirt on the planet they left behind. No one wants them in trade because they can simply walk out their door and pick them up. Bleak. Dystopian. Gems and precious metals cannot be traded for anything of substantial value. 

Their atomic nuclei are unstable enough to be smashed together (nuclear fusion) if they impact other molecules in the air at velocities that a bullet pushing the air can cause. Make the energy released enough to smash the bullet. The new element produced by the nuclear transmutation is solid and strong enough to mostly contain the released energy (so that the energy release is localized and doesn't eg destroy the entire town).
