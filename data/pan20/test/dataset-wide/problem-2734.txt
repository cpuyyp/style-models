I don't think formal logic is really necessary for ethics. However, logical reasoning has played a large role in modern ethical thinking, usually expressed in terms of rules for political-social organization of a "just society." Examples include Kant's categorical imperative, Bentham's felicitous calculus, and Rawls' theory of justice. It is simply a matter of setting your axioms and rules of "the good," then reasoning towards those ends. Hobbes, for example, begins with the axiomatic assumption that "all men fear being murdered" and "any man is capable of murdering any other." He then proceeds with a systematic development based, in his words, on Euclid'd geometry. Rawls was responsible for reintroducing ethics and justice in analytical philosophy. He commences with the axiomatic, "veil of ignorance" in which the reasoning agent seeks his own ends, but begins in absolute ignorance of what position, body, or talents he/she might possess. He then adds other decision "rules." Prior to Rawls, ethics had been largely abandoned on the analytical side, where mathematical logic reigned supreme under a strict division of "fact" and "value." This, incidentally, was a welcome state of affairs for the supposed economic logic of the "market" under theories of marginal utility. A calculus of all values. It was the eventual erosion of a secure foundation for "facts" that whittled away the "fact/value" divide and reopened ethical and other "value" topics on the Anglo-American side. Logical systems, such as game theory, can certainly apply as long as certain fundamental values are axiomatically accepted as "ends." However, as I say, modern symbolic logic may be of limited use here. 

Philosophy itself does not progress... precisely because it is the permanent prerequisite of progress in all other fields. The natural sciences and various other subdisciplines that pride themselves on "making progress," were all developments of philosophy. Indeed, before the term "science" was introduced as a demarcation in the 19th century, those who followed the Baconian turn in philosophy, such as Boyle or Newton, were self-identified "natural philosophers." Philosophy thus preceded and "seeded," such specialized disciplines as physics-chemistry, linguistics, formal logic, psychology, sociology, computer logic, and cognitive sciences. What's the difference? The spinoff subdisciplines employ a formal apparatus for evaluating evidence and eliminating disagreement. The elimination of "disagreements" is also the elimination of "history." The discipline continually closes off its historical origins, so that the physicist or cognitive scientist deals only with specialized problems and need not read ancestral works by Galileo or Leibniz. This radical reduction enables the application of mathematical, quantifiable, "spatialized" measurements, by which "progress" is marked. It also follows the modernist trend towards a ceaseless division of labor. Thus a self-designated "science," like Adam Smith's pin factory, becomes ever more "productive." Philosophy, meanwhile, struggles to retain and continually reevaluate its own history. It is holistically "self-conscious." It still reads Thales and Plato. This is a necessary retention of "origins" and "the whole," out of which the subdisciplines emerged. The attempt at metaphysics, the search for relations between the "progressing" disciplines. By leaving the "historical files" permanently open, philosophy refuses to reduce, define, and specialize its subject matter. So, in a sense, the constraints that enable sciences to "make progress," mark their self-separtation from philosophy. Once you are eliminating your history, strictly defining "knowledge," and accumulating a consensus, you are, by definition, no longer part of the speculative philosophy out of which you originated. Meanwhile, the hermeneutical recycling of origins, concepts, and imagination through "philosophy" acts a a kind of ecosystem for the growth and coherence of all these subdisciplines. And what does philosophy get for its trouble? Mockery, accusations of metaphysical wool-gathering. In sum, repudiation of the ancestor, repression of origins. It is only when progress in science suddenly breaks down in "crisis" that "philosophical speculation" arises within the subdisciplines, as it clearly has in physics. The quantum-cosmological "Return of the Repressed" that is today frustrating the sense of "progress" in physics. Otherwise, philosophy's "progressive" seedlings are content to mock it as a doting old king wandering blindly in circles. "Oh, sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child!" 

The project of rigidly correlating consciousness with brain states has met with many refutations. But I have never heard of one that refers to one of the simplest physical facts about consciousness. No matter how defined, we have no examples of "consciousness" that did not arise out of the generational horizon of sexual reproduction, fertilization, gestation, and birth. Moreover, the most fundamental operations of consciousness seek to return it to this cellular continuum, the only space in which it can be preserved against entropy. Yet in attempting a material monism or what is called a "physicalist" modeling of consciousness and brain states, the "model" is invariably isolated or "lifted out" of this physical continuum. This itself smacks of the very Cartesian dualism the physical models wish to avoid. Shouldn't any definition of "consciousness" entail the necessity of its own reproduction and cellular preservation? In failing to do so, are "brain state" theories actually dualist? Is this inseparability from a cellular continuum, in itself, a defensible argument against mind-brain reductions? (And, if I may add, is there some clearer way in the mind-body literature to sort out what I'm trying to ask? I am always scandalized by the absence of the sexual continuum in philosophy, but never sure how to insert it into arguments, hence the "feminism" tag.) 

Your point about the memory function of language and the possibility of a "private aid to memory" is interesting. Like a species, communication must "re-member" and "re-pair" itself. As Luhmann, notes a "failure of communication" only produces more communication. It repairs and regenerates itself. So if you simply take communication as prior to Cartesian "individuals" then we are "always already" instantiations of language "remembering" itself. I suppose the main thing is your starting point. And the errors entailed by the Cartesian starting point of the isolate subject, who is somehow spontaneously self-generated with his Adamic pronouns and predicates. A royal road or reductio to solipsism or divine assistance. For Wittgenstein, I believe, part of the very definition of language, as you suggest, is as a special subset of "observable behaviors." Prior to what is later privatized as "my consciousness." (Wittgenstein experts, please correct me.) For Wittgenstein's pupil P.F. Strawson, the regenerative embodiment is likewise given. The correct starting point is not a Cartesian subject, but a "Person," defined by Strawson as both consciousness and materiality, hence with "observable behaviors" from which one cannot prescind. I see two problems with your argument. First, Bob somehow already has the mental capacity for language. It is really "language in the first place" that is the problem and the necessity of something "already shared," whether Kantian or Chomskyan, prior to it. Bob's predicative mind already says, as if to someone, "Lo, I shall create a private language." Second, Bob's ineffable experiences are no different from all experiences, ultimately derivable from the senses. They are of a particularity and singularity that cannot be reiterated or behaviorally exhausted. But can Bob's behavioral "memory aids" reiterate them, even for Bob? Not fully and technically. Thus what is most reliably "effable" is in some degree a priori. Wittgenstein was a Kantian in some sense. It is prior to the interior "privacy" of the Cartesian individual. So, I would say you are right. The privacy argument is more about our definition of language than about the possibility of private codes and secret handwriting, which are, like an infertile species or prayer-mumbling anchorites, aiming at self-extinction. Language grows, regenerates, and infiltrates materiality, carrying discrete individuals along with it. 

When you ask if "causality" requires an "arrow of time," I believe it is not impertinent to say, the opposite is more nearly the case. The Newtonian, "billiard ball" picture of causation is reversible. Run the events backwards and you could not tell the difference. This is why such mechanical causality can be captured in mathematics, where there is no friction, disorganization, or entropy. Entropy or the "Arrow of Time" is generally taken as the peculiar directionality of time as increasing "disorder" from some "point of view" and the apparent fact that such a point of view can never actually be eliminated from the picture. What occurs cannot be reversed. The "arrow" does not, cannot possibly, return to the bow. If this is "really" the case, and we assume it really is, then no "cause" is reversible or perfectly repeats itself, and "causation" appears pragmatic or nominalist. You also ask if this is "just an idea." Teleology and the four Aristotelean "causes" seem to be making a comeback in "emergence," etc., against the old Newtonian, billard-ball model. If, say, "strange attractors" or "black holes" or even "desires" have some causal force, do they act before or after the "effect?" (Confusion of A series, B series time?) Hegel seems to take a somewhat nominalist or at least ambiguous view of mechanical "causation." He rightly pointed out that causation is retrospectively selective. One cannot identify a "cause" until one has identified the "effect." So in conscious representation, effects always precede causes. So, I guess my answer to your question is: no. 

Like others here, I am a little unclear on whether you asking why Blackburn rejects psychological egoism? Or merely asking why he uses the word "entirely"? If the former, I would guess it has to do with "desire" being used in a simple causal manner, while it is in fact a very poorly defined cause that is never falsifiable and subject to an explanatory infinite regress or tautology. If we call "desire" that which causes us to struggle to write a great poem and equally that which causes us to remove our hand from a hot plate, then we have a causal entity as handily vacuous as God's Will. If we use "desire" to imply material reduction, then we face many well-known problems with naive physicalism. But, of course, we'd have to see more of Blackburn's context. If you are merely asking, on what grounds does he use the unqualified "entirely," I'd say on purely rhetorical grounds. It is a stylistic flourish or punctuation point, not a logical proposition. And quite properly so. Like any philosopher, I'm sure Blackburn accepts that absolutes cannot be so indisputably grounded. But one must assume at the very least a considered, coherent stance, within which certain concepts or conclusions will be "entirely" incompatible. And presumably Blackburn holds such a position vis a vis psychological egoism... one he feels entirely willing and able to defend as required. And like philosophers who feel their field is important enough to engage a general readership, he realizes that you simply cannot write engaging prose laden with qualifiers, cautions, footnotes, and equivocations...like a rabbit ever ready to retract himself into his burrow. So in such a context, to use disputative words like "entirely wrong" actually makes it more clear that this indicates the author's considered stance. It is, many would say, far more "balanced" than a tedious covering up of one's axiomatic tracks or the textbook pretense of a Fox News "fair and balanced" philosophy. 

Let's simply assume that, whatever else it may entail, "prestige" is a form of value or power. Some products may in fact bestow power. A gun lends its owner a real physical (and often compensatory) power; a private jet gives it owner a real, measurable capacity to do what others cannot and, being very expensive, can only be owned by those with plenty of money, an indication of further exceptional privileges and physical capacities. Nothing illusory about it. A shampoo cooed over lasciviously by a celebrity, on the other hand, could be bought by almost anyone and is unlikely to impart unusual powers via one's hair. The appeal to authority is here appeal to "aura." To buy the product is to act on the belief in a superstitious transfer of qualities. By vague magical association, one expects that using the same shampoo will transfer that celebrity's aura of sexiness, for example, or some other characteristic that is not, quite obviously, derived from shampoo. So the "fallacy" is to believe in the transfer of human qualities through inanimate objects, something like Marx's commodity fetishism. However, it is not at all clear to me that a kind of transfer of "aura" cannot to some degree take place in a universal commodity culture. If you own what celebrity (x) owns or travel to the remote place celebrity (Y) travelled, others may, however faintly, associate you with celebrity (x), for better or worse. You do now have something in common with these celebrities. And since "celebrity" itself may be a kind of communicative power and value, perhaps you are faintly channeling it, assuming highly impressionable acquaintances. In an information society of complex, maximal feedback the author's classical "fallacy" of fetishism may not be as fallacious as it once was. 

Anecdotally, yes, there is a famous example of such a metaphysics, usually referred to as "turtles all the way down...." Since the joke usually attributes this, via William James, to Hindu philosophies, perhaps there is some actual version of it in Eastern traditions, I really don't know. There are, of course, theogonies dating back to Hesiod, in which the present God has an ancestral lineage, a casual regress back to Chaos or Void, which might be defined as "infinite regress itself." But I don't think that's what you mean. I believe most Western philosophers would regard it as useless, irresolvable speculation and a misunderstanding of infinity. It might qualify as an example of Hegel's "spurious infinity," Kant's antinomies of first cause, or even a variant of Everett's "many worlds" thesis. As far as I can tell, which isn't far, that implies a kind of "causal infinite" residing in mathematics. If you've gone that far, why not toss in God? In general, I believe both God and Universe are taken to be absolute identities. Since God, at least, is already "infinite," nothing happens if we add more "prior" Gods, the successive totality remains the same. I don't know enough about Cantor's sets, but I don't see some convenient analogy where infinite beings from Aleph on could "line up" in some sort of causal sequence. The problem seems to lie in the contradiction or incommensurability of "infinite" and "causal," which is why God is not regarded as understandable in either analytic or synthetic terms. Hence faith in He Who Is "beyond all understanding." Now, there might be something pertinent in Hegel's theology. Geist is not infinite regress but more like infinite progress. Hegel does seem to mix causality or "history" with the "true infinite." But then Geist is not God either. 

Short answer: Oui. In Nihil Unbound Ray Brassier makes a case for the absolute validity, realism, and positive nihilism of the scientific project itself. In its negations and development of the oft-maligned "view from nowhere" the scientific view steadily reduces our phenomenological picture of "man-in-the-world" into a smaller and smaller pointless blip within space, time, and evolution. Brassier focuses in particular on the capacity of science to conceive of and validate "truths" beyond the existence of science, meaning, or consciousness itself, such as the big bang or the extinction of the sun in 4.5 billion years. This is, he argues, a true escape from a subject-oriented ontology. For Brassier this is the only undeniable value and true being of the eroding "human," to rid itself of the pitiful, clinging illusion of "man" and "self." At the same time, Brassier does retain a synthesizing form of the "rational subject" in his scientific naturalism and "transcendental realism." And there are others--Lyotard or Zen Buddhists, for example--who undertake an unsentimental, atoms-and-void post-humanism. 

I am not sure that "soul" is very well defined across cultures. But it seems to me that, as James Kingsbery observes, interpretations of Christianity could fit your query, as might modern folk psychology. The soul in much Christian and Neoplatonist doctrine is "simple substance" in that it is continuous and indivisible. Yet outside of Calvinist predetermination is it clearly "mutable," in that it registers the imprint of our actions. And in some Augustinian interpretations, I believe, the defiled soul is not so much eternally damned, as simply lost to divine life, thus in a sense rendered finally "mortal." In Plato's "Myth of Er" at the end of the Republic, not only are "souls" mutable, they are recycled through a kind of plastics factory of mortal destinies. But I would hesitate to say that souls for the Greeks are eternal. As far as I know, that is not entirely clear and consistent. They did not seem to hold ideas of "linear infinity" in our mathematical or Christian sense. It is more as if "soul stuff" gets melted down into the blanks of entirely new persons. Meanwhile, many people in our modern secular age believe death ends it all, yet do adhere to belief in a psyche, an object of "psychology," that is treated as a mutable but continuous identity or "simple" substance, even as its parts are regularly replaced. I'm not sure how else one would define a "mortal" or finite "soul." Finally, there are many instances in myth in which a "soul" is actively rendered finite, as it is "released" from the confines of its perpetuation, as with the Buddha, Dracula, and various other unearthly Wanderers.
