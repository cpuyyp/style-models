As other answers have stated, it seems that there may be more than meets the eye as to why the technicians are shown as available in the software while your manager tells you not to book any before the end of the month. Rather than just answer your question with a simple "yes" or "no" as to whether you're lying, I think it would be more productive to get to the root cause of the problem. Speak to your manager. Ask why you shouldn't be booking before the end of the month, and suggest that, if the technicians are actually not available (perhaps they're scheduled for training, or are being sent off to a remote site to do some work, or whatever else), that they should be marked as such in your scheduling software. If your manager says that technicians are available but still should not be booked, provide your anecdote about the upset customer you spoke with -- you documented the call in your support system, right? At the end of the day it's your manager's decision as to whether you are permitted to schedule these technicians, but perhaps there's a reason for it, and addressing it directly (but politely) with your manager is the best approach. If the technicians aren't available, ask your manager if you can inform customers of the reason. They may still be unhappy if all your technicians are unavailable due to training or some other activity, but at least they will know that no, there actually aren't any available. 

That was the wrong response. Whoever says a number first is at a disadvantage. Make them say the number first if they want you. The correct response is "I'm sure your offer will be both fair and competitive, and I look forward to reading your offer letter." 

Since they are punished for doing the latter and rewarded for the former, it's not clear why you expected otherwise. Incentives matter. I am reminded of a question on another site -- posted by a professor! -- about why so many college students are fixated on their grades, rather than their mastery of the material. Because they've been told their entire lives that all that matters to their future ability to live comfortably is their grades. Why would we expect them to behave any differently? We built these Skinner boxes; we should not be surprised when the human animals in the boxes try to maximize their rewards and minimize their punishments. 

NOTE: I advise not emptying the box daily unless the setting absolutely demands it (e.g. classroom is shared with others, room does not lock, etc). Daily emptying may make those who aren't donating feel as though you're "checking up" -- if three people put envelopes in on a particular day and you check every day, then if all three envelopes are empty you know that all three people made fake contributions. 

I work at a web services company, and am being asked to interview a candidate who, if hired, would be my peer. I've never conducted any interview before, let alone someone who would be my peer, and have no idea where to begin, and whether I should proceed any differently given that I am interviewing a potential peer rather than a subordinate. The only time I've been interviewed by peers -- at a former job -- it was a very informal and unorthodox interview (my then-future coworkers very much went against the company grain in pretty much every aspect, and even admitted to me after I was hired that they didn't conduct the interview as they were expected to, and all they cared about was that I was competent and would get along with them). Should I conduct this any differently from a normal (non-peer) interview, and are there any particular questions I could ask that might not be relevant/useful otherwise? Thanks! 

Again no offense intended but be realistic. Would you do that if you were Bob? I wouldn't! The supposition that Bob will take one for the team and be happy about it is not realistic. Bob will quit and angrily badmouth his former company on social media. 

Well, were I the hiring manager I would interpret your statements as "instead of me paying for training to improve my own skills, tell you what, you guys pay me to take up the time of your employees who will mentor me, and in exchange I'll abandon you for my better-paying freelance work after I've learned what I can from you". Maybe that's not what you intended to communicate, but that's what I'd hear. I've had interview candidates who told me straight up that they intended to use the position as a stepping stone to work outside my division or my company; I "no hired" those people. They might be great technical candidates, but if I'm just going to have to find their replacement in six months or a year, it's better to pass on them. 

I'm not fond of PayPal for this purpose because it doesn't offer anonymity against you; you will see the name and email address of everyone who makes a PayPal contribution. Furthermore, some people don't have a PayPal account but may still wish to contribute. Even if you've made it clear that these are just voluntary donations, some may still be concerned that you will treat them differently or otherwise judge them if they don't contribute; this is why I feel it is important to keep the donations opaque to you as well. To combine and clarify some of the other ideas, you could have a locking wooden box with a slot in the top as your donation box; for security, use a cable lock to chain it to the table or something similar that will discourage it from "walking off". Next to the box, have envelopes, and encourage students to take an envelope on their way out. Leave the box sitting there for the duration of the course (empty it periodically of course). Some students may take an envelope and come back the next day with it. Others who forget might not bring the envelope in for a week or two, but sooner or later they'll remember if they're really serious about making a donation (or having the appearance thereof). 

Though it doesn't matter now, next time you can try: Nancy, I am open to suggestions on how I can improve my communication with clients; however, this does not include being untruthful. 

You have a personality You have enough confidence in yourself to stand out among the rest of the nerds in the bunch 

If I am the hiring manager and I have a stack of 25 resumes, I would be most intrigued by you listing that skill. It shows: 

I disagree with almost everyone's opinion here. If I'm the hiring manager and I need to choose between 2 candidates who are equally qualified, and one seems more enthusiastic than the other for the job, then there's no question I would go with the one who's checking in frequently. 

If during the interview you are uncomfortable asking about the dress code, chances are the company is not a good fit for you. If you do not have abnormal confidence issues and are emotionally healthy, and yet still you feel uncomfortable asking a question that almost 100% of the time would not make any difference on whether you get hired, then I would insist that there is something wrong with this place. On the other hand if you are having some self-confidence challenges, (often a sign of humility), you should know that although it is natural and human beings often cannot help but judge each other (unless they work on themselves), your intellect and generally being a kind person, will by far outweigh the question you are dreading to ask.
