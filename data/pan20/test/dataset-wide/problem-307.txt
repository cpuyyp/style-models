There aren't many options. Even if you completely shattered the moon then the remains would continue on a merry orbit and most likely turn into a ring. The most likely scenario would be a rogue body (a reasonably large planet, neutron star, black hole, etc) passing through the solar system. If that passed close enough it could massively disrupt the orbits of any body it passes. Capturing the moon away from the earth, the earth away from the moon, or even just splitting them up and sending them both careening away across the solar system. The problem with this though is that it would almost certainly have a huge effect on the earth as well. The close passage of the heavy body would at a minimum cause massive tides and interesting weather systems. The force that separates the earth and the moon could also easily send us into an orbit not very hospitable to life or even if the other body was massive enough break us out of orbit around the sun entirely. It would also disrupt the orbit of all the other planets in the solar system to varying degrees, it would definitely make for interesting times! Beyond that a hypothetical FTL drive attached to either the earth or the moon could cause it one to fly away from the other. Equally an incredibly powerful non-FTL drive could over time have the same effect. 

While the ice sheets are still expanding or stable then probably not. Everything would be ground up and buried under a lot of ice and the ice would extend faster than the debris. It would need a very specific set of circumstances to have a city large enough to supply a good amount of material where the glaciers are carrying the material around and melting at a point humans can reach. However once the ice starts to retreat then hexagon is absolutely right. The retreating ice would leave large moraine's which are big deposits of all the material gathered up by the ice. All sorts of legacies of the past could be found in those deposits, with things like steel and other metal being a prime candidate. 

Set up a website using a free hosting service. Post the information on there. Also email alerts to relevant authorities and link them to that website. Make sure you only ever access that website or send those emails (including the very first ones to set it up) through a TOR router or similar protected method. At the moment TOR done properly is still effectively untraceable. People have been caught using TOR but only by making mistakes or visiting compromised servers. Make sure you stay current on relevant technology and consider adding more protection and relays as required. 

This depends on what you mean by "intergalactic speeds". There is certainly a lot of energy there for you to work with, unfortunately there's also a LOT of energy there to do inconvenient things like obliterate your probe. Assuming you managed to construct the probe appropriately then it could certainly ride the jet and get some energy out of it - however there is another problem. The further you move on the jet the lower the acceleration becomes. The particles will spread out and slow down and the jet will become steadily weaker. You would need to get as much acceleration as possible as early as possible and then after that you are going to be coasting with whatever boost you managed to pick up and no more to add to it. (This also doesn't address how you are going to slow down at your destination!). 

There is a non-orbital solution as well. We've not got the technology to build it but 40k is considerably more advanced in many ways. Have the larger planet orbiting at it's natural orbit. Have the smaller planet orbiting in the shadow of the larger one further away from the larger planet. As already discussed there is a problem with this, they will drift apart. Embed a tether made of unobtanium through the cores of both planets and through space between them. That tether is strong enough to stop them from drifting apart. They now orbit as a joint unit. You would need to arrange the dynamics so that they hold the same position relative to each other (good thing you wanted tidally locked) and keep a modest tension on the tether. 

The other answers are excellent but there is one important thing to add - the shape of the planet. Planets normally form a sphere as they are condensing from a liquid form and gravity pulls it into a flat sphere as it does so. In this case though it would actually form a very squashed sphere, it may even form what looks a lot like a disk, as the level "effective gravity" point is modified by the spin. At the extremes you are talking here the planet may only be (for example) 1 km tall and 6 million km wide. You would have very low experienced gravity no matter where you went on the surface. This would be modified a little depending on whether the planet cooled before or after it acquired this extreme spin though. 

The problem is that once anything has crossed the event horizon it needs to be travelling faster than light to come back out - which is impossible with any known science. So you either need to accelerate the mass to FTL speeds or reduce the curvature of space-time so that mass can escape. However you do this I'm viewing it as being like puncturing a balloon, you create a breach in the event horizon and let the mass from the black hole pour out through it. The mass would jet away into space gradually reducing the size of the black hole until it is all out. The breach can be explained using either of the mechanics I explain above - either you're forming a wormhole or in some other way accelerating the matter to FTL speeds or you're reducing the gravitational effect in a region so it's no longer a singularity at that point. Doing this would require a LOT of energy, you need to overcome the gravitational force of the black hole to suck the matter inside it out or you're going to be violating several laws of thermodynamics. 

This answer builds on several of the others and offers a purely natural way to achieve the desired result. If you have a low-lying basin near the sea then an exceptionally high tide/storm/tsunami would flood the area with sea water. Over the next few decades that sea-water would gradually evaporate, naturally concentrating the salt into a smaller and smaller area. In the end once all the water has vanished you would see an area that had normal vegetation at the edges, dead trees in the center, and slowly decreasing levels of vegetation until you reach a completely dead area in the center.
