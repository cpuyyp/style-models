Image from Yongyun Hu and Jun Yang, PNAS 111 629–634 (2013), doi: 10.1073/pnas.1315215111 You can notice on this Figure from meteorological model od Hu & Yang that the substellar point is not the hottest place, thanks to the wind. The hottest places are two points just above and below it. However, if Earth got tidally locked, the Coriolis force would be almost non-existent and the most dominant feature would be air rising at substellar point and near-ground winds moving towards it. (There some videos exploring this scenario 1, 2, 3, although not the wind pattern itself.) This situation was described in Vincent's and PipperChips answers. Do not miss: The transition from wind pattern of slow rotating planets without Coriolis force and quickly rotating planets of red dwarfs is nicely illustrated in Oceaniis' post at the Forum of Speculative Evolution. Interesting source is also this post at the SpaceEngine forum. Interesting source for deeper study is also thesis of R. A. Edson. 

In general the energy expense is measured in Joules and the (maximum) rate in Watts (Joule/s). If you want to be "correct" you need to compute the amount of energy needed for each of the "feats" and take into account the side effects: 

If panels are kept reasonably well (and are not stolen, of course) yo can expect a mean degradation < 1%/year for reasonably good quality panels (the whole story is here). This means you may expect to get about 1/3 power out of the panel after 100 years. This figure already includes small damage due to "normal" wear and tear (temperature stress, cleaning, ...) but does not include major events (e.g.: a tree falling over the panel or it being stolen). Note this figure is constant for a certain number of years (dependent on quality, but surely >= 50y), then will start to increase due to other factors collectively labeled "corrosion of cell and interconnect" that can be disregarded for a certain period, but later become prevalent and depend heavily on maintenance (especially waterproofing as sealants fail after a number of years of sunshine exposure). 

Imagine there is a country in which there are all important natural resources (oil, gas, metal ores, wood, etc.) in their natural form and which lies in a temperate climate region. There may be some portion of a sea. The country is completely isolated from the rest of the world - nothing (except for air, precipitation, etc.) can get in or out. What is the minimum population and size of the country to sustain a developed industrial society? (All the technology used there has to be produced somewhere in the country eventually.) The technology level is current. (Year 2014, realistic technologies that can be mass-produced with reasonable cost.) By other words: What is the minimum amount of people and land to produce self-sustained agriculture and all relevant factories that are necessary for complete self sufficiency in industry from mining all ores to producing the final devices? Consider that people need to be educated and not all are geniuses that can be educated to the cutting-edge technology expert levels. EDIT: You can assume the technology is initially present, it does not have to be invented, but next generation must be able to learn it and understand it. (For example people have a very good library, or computer database, as long as the computers are running.) 

I don't know about what would be needed for a ground-based magnets, but the proposed NASA magnetic shield in L1 (described in detail here) needs a single magnetic field: "1 or 2 Tesla (or 10,000 to 20,000 Gauss) as an active shield against the solar wind". Further information and justification for the above numbers can be found here. 

You can have real rock mazes when large rock formations break and open-up corridors in them. Think Black Hills rock maze on steroids. 

Wheels have (at least) two drawbacks - you need some kind of hub where the wheel can turn on (and also some way to apply power to it) - wheels are not a good choice on rough terrain. Some "in-between" (not yet birds, but no longer dinosaurs) used their short "proto-wings" to help accelerating while running. I'm unsure of what speed they could attain, but I think that's the best you can get without too much handwaving. 

Imagine a world in which technology we would probably call "technological singularity" is possible and already happened on few places of the galaxy. By the singularity I do not mean that anything is possible, but rather that original biological species transform themselves into extremely highly intelligent computer programs with big amount of control of their environment, and they completely transcend their biological nature. The post-singularity societies might rebuild planets to giant computers or even create Matrioshka brains, since the main scarce resources are computer time and memory. It would be relatively easy for such civilization to send spaceships that would transform all solar systems in our galaxy into computers and utilize them. It would be even easy for a small splinter faction inside such civilization, unless the "official forces" actively prevent it. The motivation is simply a lot of resources and freedom to gain. My question is: Are there plausible reasons that would prevent it and keep the civilizations bound to their home star systems? If there is such, the reason should be strong and valid for all such civilizations. If nine out of ten civilizations decide not to spread, and one does, the galaxy will still be transformed. 

In any case anything stopping overseas commerce for longish (months) periods is going to be utterly destructive as almost no region of this planet is self-sufficient food-wise (surely no urban areas anywhere). Re-booting civilization is not going to be easy as lots of different materials and tools are necessary to sustain our current production style. If reboot can happen quickly that's good, otherwise, if current infrastructure is allowed to "rot" we may not have the materials needed to rebuild as all "easily accessible" mine sites have been depleted long ago and what we are currently mining needs high technology. Some materials may be scavenged in scrapyards and similar (e.g.: copper), but others would be difficult to separate (e.g: some rare earths, tungsten, etc.) 

I think Your orbit computations are "a bit off". Just to give Mercury enough energy to reach Venus orbit on a Hohmann orbit would require a tremendous amount of energy, but let's assume You get it. somehow. Energy is preserved in "close flyby", so there's no way you can stabilize Mercury in Venus orbit (requires energy) and send Venus up the gravity well to Mars (requires even more energy). Similar problems plague conservation of momentum. It is also unclear how You mean to provide "a larger magnetic field for Mars, Mercury, Callisto and possibly Venus", which is necessary to preserve atmosphere in the long run and to shield living beings from cosmic radiation. All this said: yes, if You manage to bring all planet in the "habitable zone" (Goldilock zone) and to give them suitable atmosphere then they would become "more habitable" (in the sense: "a larger number of species would be able to survive without special protection"). 

Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

The easiest is to copy actual human physiology. Human females normally (it's not a hard rule, but it "generally" works this way) don't undergo menstrual cycle (i.e.: no ovulation) while breast feeding. Other species exhibit the same behaviors (e.g.: cats). Make fathers also breast-feed (possibly a different kind of "milk") and the child to require both of them to reach maturity and you have all triggers you need. 

There are many bacteria and viruses that can infect several species, possibly with different symptoms or prognosis. An example is cow pox which is not very dangerous for humans, but they can catch it. Quite the reverse with avian flu. 

General situation would be "as if" air viscosity would be much higher. This means air would still travel for shorter distances (at the maximum 1mph speed), so a (relatively) narrow strip near the sea would still be habitable. Coasts relying on breeze would have very narrow (<<10Mi) strips, while geographic winds like Monsoon could penetrate much farther. It would be interesting to see if the energy is dissipated by viscosity (converted to heat) or kept as kinetic (air becomes more heavy and thus the slow moving air would still push as if a molasses wave). That depends, of course, on specifics of the "spell". 

There is quite simple formula that will give you the tidal-locking half-time $$T = 6 × 10^{12}\, \frac{a^6 R \mu}{ (M_s M_p^2)}\; \mathrm{years}$$ 

With these assumptions, we can calculate how does the portal behave now. If previously, we calculated the difference in potential $\Delta \Phi = g h$, now this difference is reduced by the potential gain inside the portal equal to $a_g L$. So we have $$ \Delta \Phi=gh - a_g L\;. $$ With this assumption, now have to update the formula for $m_f$ to $$ m_f=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G}\;, $$ which leads to $$ a_g=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G} \cdot \frac{G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ By solving these two equations, we obtain the final formulas $$ \begin{align} a_g &= \frac{2 d g h}{2 d L+r_g^2}\;,\\ m_f &= \frac{2 d g h r_g^2}{2 d G L+G r_g^2}\;. \end{align} $$ As we can see, with large inner length $L$, the forces near the portals can be made arbitrarily small. It is still true that if you are going from the lower portal mouth to the higher one, you are going "uphill" and you must exert work. How does it look inside the portal? Interestingly, there would be no walls. The space wraps into itself, so it looks like if you are standing between four mirrors: all around, there are images of yourself and of other things inside the portal, just they are not images, but they are really there. You could see your own back. Conservation of Momentum The solution above conserves the energy properly. However, the energy is not the only thing that should be conserved. There is also momentum. With momentum, I do not have any nice idea how to put it into equations. But similarly to the previous case, I guess there would be forces acting on any entering object that change its momentum as it is passing through the portal. The forces would act both on the passing object and on the portal gates. If it is easier to rotate the portal gate so that the object would not change its direction of motion (yes, it could be easy - the portal gates could have negligible inertial mass), they would rotate to a proper position. If they are somehow fixed, the passing object would get strong kick from the portal and its momentum would be transferred to the portal gates. This would definitely not be pleasant experience if you are entering quickly - probably like hitting a concrete wall. Note I do not know if this is the solution you wanted, but it seems quite self-consistent to me. I definitely do not guarantee that it is consistent with the general relativity - it is probably not. (On one side because the portal gates are curvature o space and require extreme exotic mass, which brings additional effects. On the other side because the proposed model is not the only one - I know at least about one more consistent possibility, that is probably the case for wormholes. If you want to go this deep, you should be asking about wormholes, not portals. 

Letting aside 100% is not something actually existing in Nature, all problem is in the definition of "lie". Please consider the famous citation (Robert A. Heinlein): 

Let us give a different twist to the answer; I'm unsure if this is what you really want to know, but... Spoon is not really a good example because technology to make it is rather basic and varied in the centuries, while the shape remained quite constant. However, if you look to other technologies you see a path often followed: 

What follows is in the hypothesis of an almost completely isolated colony. In this condition it is highly likely the colony will start up working like a single "corporation", with a trustee board, and a strict hierarchical control structure. This structure is bound to break apart sooner or later, as colony grows, giving rise to (almost) separate entities. The exact moment and mode of the breakdown will determine if and when the colony will be able to match motherland technological level. Best scenario is:
