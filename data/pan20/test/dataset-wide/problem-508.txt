Not sure why it hasn't been mentioned in the other answers but recumbents are generally much heavier than traditional frames and on steep gradients weight makes a big difference. Looks like a 2000$ recumbent is around 30lbs and a 2000$ road bike should be around 18lbs or so. 

I have flown 6x with my bike (Cyclocross Disc) in a soft padded bike bag and never once had issues with the rotors. Numerous other MTB friends never remove the rotors either and have not had trouble when flying. Echoing the comment by @Daniel, I'd be more focussed on the dropouts and RD and making sure those are supported. You are way more at risk stripping / losing screws than bending a disc. The wheels will be double padded by the wheel bag and the bike bag. 

Besides all technical aspects race speed is also a question of racing strategy. As long as there is no escape group no team might feel responsible for making pace, so the peleton might ride "slowly". Once there's an escape group the peleton might decide to keep some distance so they can catch up later, while the escapers might safe energy for a final sprint and just keep "enough" distance to the peleton. A relatively new technology - radio for riders - makes this possible. Nowadays there's quite some control and decision via radio being made ... If you look at the speed of TdF riders I'd look at the time from time trials or specific mountain climbs. 

The salt on the road can be quite bad for your bike. You should try to wash it off after every ride. Going quickly over it with a wet cloth and more intense cleaning on weekends or such will prevent rust on your bike. 

Daniel R Hicks had the right idea in the comments. (It should have been an answer). I replaced an old, barely skipping chain with a brand new one, and it skipped a lot more, right away. I finally figured out that it was too long (by 3 links), but by this point, my two most commonly used sprockets had been worn down by all the slipping. When I was looking around for this same answer a while back, I found most people talking about worn teeth/sprockets, narrow chains, and minor adjustments. I think a properly sized chain is the best foundation for avoiding this problem, and should precede all the other troubleshooting steps. Edit: There is a commonly held belief that a stretched chain causes a lot of wear on cogs simply by virtue of the increased spacing in the chain. This makes only a little sense. While an increased inter-link distance will put more stress on an individual tooth as you pedal, it's only causing a very minor and slow amount of wear compared to a chain that is slipping. (The movement plus friction of a slipping chain is going to remove a lot more material from more teeth than a static pressure on individual teeth or a tiny amount of single-link slippage). I think what's going on when a chain stretches is the following: 

This depends on the local situation I'd say. for instance the German road traffic act (StVO, Straßenverkehrsordnung) says in §2: 

Source: $URL$ That rule is not specific for bikes but all sorts of vehicles which are allowed on roads. Besides the legal situation: Going on the right makes it simpler for faster cars to overtake one. When driving too much on the left car drivers can, in my experience, become annoyed easily. While one should be riding at the edge of the road but keep some space to the right so one can navigate if there are issues on the road. 

Germany: The law says "(1) Wer abbiegen will, muß dies rechtzeitig und deutlich ankündigen" / "(1) When one wants to turn one has to indicate this in time and in a clear way" §9 StVO. I think that is a good law straight to the point. Everybody possibly affected has to be warned. In school I learned to use straight let or right arm. In practice I barely do this as much, this then again depends on the other traffic and road situation (on narrow roads of bad quality i keep my hands closer to the handlebar to keep my bike under control etc.) 

This is all just my theory of chain slippage, but it checks out with the rates of how mechanical wear occurs. It also explains why or how anybody can have those pictures of completely worn cogs while still able to bike (if your chain is the right length for most of the time you wear down your cogs, it'll all be gradual, individual link wear). If chain length weren't a major factor in slip, as soon as the teeth wore down a little bit, the effect would be the same mechanical situation as an increased inter-link distance, the chain would slip like crazy, and they wouldn't be able to bike any more to produce that massive amount of wear. 

A tiny amount of cog wear occurs when a chain begins to stretch. It does not cause slipping (beyond a small amount that happens on an individual link basis). This tiny amount of cog wear doesn't cause slippage, but it sets the mechanism up for step two. When the chain becomes long enough from the stretch (or a new and excessively long chain is installed), a number of things can allow step one above to lead to extreme slippage. The rear derailleur may not be at an angle or tension that will hold downstream links to the cogset in a way that prevents anything more than single-link slippage. A new longer chain won't be straight, and any misalignment in either the front or rear derailleur will cause the chain to skip off the cogs. Etc. As soon the chain is too long to contain slippage to one link at a time, and the whole chain slips at once, massive amounts of wear occur. The cogs become unusable a lot faster than they would with the same inter-link distance but a shorter chain. 

I'm using a Garmin Edge 500 cycle computer. For most parts I'm quite happy with it. Besides the issue of it not finding GPS from time to time there is one thing which really drives me crazy: When switching between my bikes I have to go through 5 or so menus to get to the option to pick another bike. Without doing that it won't recognize the bike sensors. Over time I had quite a few cases where I didn't realize I forgot to configure it properly. I can't image it too be too complicated software-wise to scan for all known bike sensors and automatically switch over (or ask the user "hey I'm seeing other sensors, should I switch to that bike?") so I wonder if there are folks working on alternative firmware which offers such features or where one could contribute.
