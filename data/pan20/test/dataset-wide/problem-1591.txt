So, it appears that the situation of Melania living separately from President Trump is a temporary one that is currently projected to end some time around May of 2017. So, even if it still did cost nearly $500,000 per day to protect Melania and Barron, this situation is currently planned to only last several months. As a result, even if it did cost that much per day, it wouldn't cost more than the National Endowment for the Arts on an annual basis due to the situation's limited duration. 

Cost for National Endowment for the Arts According to its own website, the FY2016 budget for the National Endowment for the Arts was just under $148 million. Comparison CNN's original figure of "more than $1 million per day" is indeed more than double $148 million per year. However, at the rate used in the more recent estimate in New York's request for compensation from the federal government, the annual cost of security would be about $173 million per year, which is obviously not double the NEA budget of $148 million. Additionally, New York has not yet indicated what it expects the cost of protecting only Melania and Barron to be vs. the cost of protecting Trump himself in addition to Melania and Barron during the transition period. 

20% is less than a third of all, but more than a 6% or even 17% of all! We may be on to something here, an older cited statistic perhaps? Continuing to the Dec 2009 Telegraph article, linked in the quote, we find this: 

Going back to the Divorce Online archives, I went all the way to the beginning of the blog in Mar 2009. No other articles even mentioned this research or any similar research. The first blog post does say that the author has had a personal blog before, but as he doesn't link to it, I'd assume it wasn't very rich on internal research publishing. There is an article containing results of their research in Jul 2009, Middle class adulterers are using Twitter to conduct illicit affairs. By Mark Keenan, however it is merely something to add to the "social networks", not the original Facebook claim. Seeing the content type of the blog (sensationalist stories, poorly sourced; 'outraged' reports on the low quality and plethora of complaints about their competitors' services, contradictory articles) I'd say this is a circularly referenced claim, most likely made up. On a leaving note, here is an article from Jun 2010, Divorce-Online tweeted by Perez Hilton by Mark Keenan, in its entirety. 

This claim is currently unproven. According to a Snopes article written today, which rates this claim as unproven, Chapman cited the CNN article linked below as his source for the security cost and he cited the apparently-correct figure of $148 million as the budget of NEA. 

8 USC 1187(a)(12) defines countries whose nationals are explicitly excluded from the U.S. Visa Waiver Program due to terrorism-related concerns. Iraq and Syria are explicitly included in this list by law. The other countries on the list are designated by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security due to terrorism-related concerns in those countries. The most recent update to this list of countries prior to Trump's executive order was issued by President Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security on February 18, 2016, just under a year prior to Trump's executive order. 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(A) provides that the Secretary of State may designate to this list any country "the government of which has repeatedly provided support of acts of international terrorism." 8 USC 1187(a)(12)(D) provides the authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to add countries (or areas) to this list: 

Most likely a humorous context, because it is not applicable. The Geneva conventions are a set of international law conventions concerning war-time situations. They have 4 main conventions: 

More on boredom and attention in LePera's Relationships between boredom proneness, mindfulness, anxiety, depression, and substance use (1): 

Naturally I don't know which particular study the author meant, and a large number examines the relationship between being distracted and boredom (a single search revealed hundreds), but this one particularly came to mind (The experience of boredom: The role of the self-perception of attention. Damrad-Frye, Robin; Laird, James D. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 57(2), Aug 1989, 315-320.): 

Addendum: Other news articles citing the Telegraph Dec 2009 article seem to also mistake it for a US statistic, eg this one, copying the false attribution from here. This one simply attributed the statistic to the Feb 2012 article at Divorce Online, not to Forbes. Checking the references didn't seem to happen a lot concerning this particular tidbit, many reporting on it were comfortable with just repeating the claim on no factual basis. 

Regarding the meme's statement that "conspicuous in their absence are the 3 Muslim countries with which Trump does business": While the meme doesn't explicitly define what it considers to be a "Muslim country," if we define "Muslim countries" to mean "majority-Muslim countries," according to Wikipedia's list of Islam by Country, there are approximately 52 such countries or territories, 45 of which are absent from Department of Homeland Security's list. The three excluded countries listed in the meme are hardly alone among Muslim-majority in being absent from the list, nor is their absence particularly 'conspicuous.' There are a number of other Muslim-majority countries in which terrorism concerns are more widespread than in any of those three countries which are also absent from the list, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, for example. 

The cited CNN article is from November 21, 2016, while Trump was the President-Elect and was still himself living in Trump Tower prior to taking office and moving to D.C. It says: 

On December 7, 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City was interviewed by a local TV station. During the interview, de Blasio was asked about these costs: 

Clearly all these laws talk about collective punishment only in time of war, but let's also look at Art. 33's commentary on collective punishment. Emphasis mine: 

The Daily Mail, unsurprisingly, has provided a misleading 'clickbait' title for the article. The title doesn't match up with what details they actually say in the article (and which you cited) - your quote doesn't claim Facebook is involved in a third of UK divorces, it claims it is involved in a third of last year divorces that cited unreasonable behavior as a factor. Possibly this claim also qualifies this is about divorces where the sourced law firm was directly involved, but that's not a clear implication. According to this article at The Guardian, which cites as its source the Grant Thornton's 2011 matrimonial survey in the UK, unreasonable behavior was a reason in 17% of (then) recent UK divorces. Looking at the report itself, these percentages come from a survey question in which a lawyer would select three most common reasons for divorce. This study seems to be from the same rough time-frame the Daily Mail article has been published, it is therefore very likely that a much more accurate title would be 6% of recent UK divorces citing Facebook as a factor. 

November 8 to January 20th is 74 days. $35 million / 74 days is about $473,000 per day. Mr. de Blasio also noted that assuming this would apply to the period after Trump takes office is premature. Snopes is still waiting on getting more up-to-date information: 

However, the CNN article which he references is citing a figure for protecting all of Trump's family (including his adult children and their families) along with Trump himself while he was the President-Elect and living at Trump Tower, not for the cost of protecting Melania alone (or Melania and Barron alone.) Additionally, later statements from the Mayor of New York City indicate that the cost was actually closer to $500,000 per day, not $1 million per day. Furthermore, Melania and Barron living in NYC appears to also be a temporary arrangement until the end of Barron's current school year, not a permanent one. 

The statements in the meme are generally correct, but there is no evidence to support the implication that those countries were excluded because of Trump's business interests. The answer to the title question is, no, Trump didn't exclude those countries (nor did he or his administration explicitly include or exclude any other countries.) The relevant section of the executive order signed by Trump (Section 3(c),) did not actually list any countries at all for the entry ban. Instead, it applied to a list of countries that has already existed under U.S. law for several years and was most recently updated a bit under a year ago by the Obama administration.
