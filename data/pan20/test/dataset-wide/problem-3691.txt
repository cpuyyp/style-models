This year, I'm planning on running a 5k, a 10k, and a half marathon in 2015. The dates of the races other than the 5k haven't been announced yet. However, based on last year's dates, there will be about 2 months (9 weeks or so) between the 5k and the 10k and about 4 months (16 weeks) between the 10k and the half marathon. I'm also planning on moving from a maintenance schedule to a training schedule after the holidays, leaving me with about 12 weeks of training before the 5k. I completed a 5k last year, and have ran 10k training runs, but never competed at that distance. My official 5k time is 29:32. I'd like to get that down to 25:00 or less. I'd also like to run an official 10k of less than 1:00:00 (hopefully ~55:00) and a half marathon in ~2:30:00, if those times are reasonable. How should I manage my training? I see four obvious solutions that seem reasonable: 

If you're actively seeking medical treatment for a longstanding back problem, I'd advise against starting any sort of weightlifting program without at least consulting with your phylsiotherapist. Also, if you have a recent history of being unable to walk without pain, you may find basic gym exercises a little overwhelming a first. Thats not to say you can't improve with time, and grow into them in the future. Like some other people here said, I'd talk with your therapist about entering an exercise program. @BackInShapeBuddy made a good point - make sure your therapist understands that you're trying to transition into weightlifting as an eventual goal. When I hurt my rotator cuff and had to go into physical therapy (years ago), my therapist put me on a slightly different plan than if my goal was just to be pain free without physical activity - he actually taught me he to lift safely, and then later recommend a personal trainer for me to move on to. Keep in mind that gym trainers will have wildly varying levels of sophistication. Some might not understand how to help you through your issues (sometimes successful athletes just don't know how to deal with people who have medical problems because they've never experienced it personally) 

I don't know, but in order to make progress (that is, gain strength), you must actually recover; your schedule must accommodate this. 

I suggest that you read "The First Three Questions" and do a novice linear strength progression, using the low-bar barbell back squat, the overhead press, the deadlift, and the bench press. 

Having someone watch your exercises, especially for any spinal flexion. Strengthening your back with properly-programmed and meticulously-executed low-bar back squats and deadlifts. 

Yes, until you begin fasting, you should continue to train as usual and eat as much as you can. Put on extra bodyfat to help fuel you through the fast. During your fasting period, eat as much as you can when you can (that is, after dark). Reduce your training volume but do one heavy set of each exercise instead of multiple sets; this way, you will bias your body toward preserving strength without exceeding your reduced recovery capacity. 

If you do free-weight exercises with good form and appropriate weights, this problem should gradually correct itself. The only important caveat would be that if you do exercises with dumbbells, you need to make sure that you do the same weight and same number of repetitions with you strong right hand as you do with your weaker left hand. For anything you do, you'll have to use a weight that your (weaker) left side can handle. That weight might not be enough to stimulate your stronger right side, but that's what you want, because it would force your left side to grow stronger, while your right side will stay about the same. Eventually, your left side will start to catch up. With exercise machines there's a chance that one arm could compensate for the other, so you might want to stay away from those. 

My apartment complex gym got a new hip machine that supports four types of hip exercises - flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. I'm primarily a runner (I run 3.5+ miles three days a week, low impact cardio usually on an elliptical on the weekends), but I do strength training two days a week (3 sets of 10 reps, 70% of max) and recalibrate my max once a month. Of the four hip exercises that this machine supports, which one(s) should I be doing to best support my running? A few quick searches suggests exercising (stretching and strengthening) flexors and adductors more frequently than others, but it's kind of vague. Should I do all four, or just a subset? And would be 3 sets of 10 reps at 70% of max be suitable for this type of exercise as well? 

callus rasp I use a "callus rasp" once a week or so to keep the calluses from growing too large. Look for a one that has some convex curvature, so you grind a specific, small area of your finger / palm. Cuticle Scissors If I've ever let them get way too large, trimming the calluses down with a pair of cuticle scissors seems to be the best way to get rid of large amounts of skin 

Learn technique You can usually pick up lots of technical pointers by watching other people climb the same routes as you, and just hanging out in the bouldering area. You could also look into a skills class or group coaching class, if your gym offers one. "Novice Gains" are your friend This kind of very basic, semi-structured bouldering will still wear you out, and produce a positive training affect. You'll develop more strength and endurance in your fingers, build a better base of technique, and get to know more climbers in the gym all without having to kill yourself trying to train multiple sessions a day, or being on a super strict training plan. Take advantage of this. Ride that pony until it dies. Then go out looking for a more aggressive plan. 

No, there is no obvious problem with squatting on the day after deadlifting. Squatting and deadlifting during the same workout is fairly common, and fine. 

Self-verification of a trainee's movement execution may be difficult or nearly impossible, especially if that trainee is unathletic. If a coach is absent then the next best -- though not necessarily sufficient -- option available to the trainee is self-made videos of the movement, reviewed immediately thereafter (for example, after a set of deadlifts). Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training details five steps that a trainee can use to teach herself to deadlift, as well as symptoms of common movement errors and how to correct such errors. You can use these steps to teach someone to deadlift correctly. The Aasgaard Company has published several videos of trainees being taught/coached to deadlift. 

It's great to hear that you're enjoying resistance training. Instead of the exercises you listed, I recommend presses and bench presses. The Aasgaard Company's "Starting Strength" videos might help you start. Consider exercising thrice weekly (every 48-72 hours), alternating the press with the bench press on successive workouts, for three sets of five repetitions each ("3x5"). Once progress slows or you miss reps on successive sets, switch to five sets of three repetitions each ("5x3"). If you are female then consider switching as soon as the 3x5 gets "hard", before you start missing reps. On the first workout, work up from the empty bar (20 kg, or smaller, if necessary) to a weight that you can handle safely and with good form for the 3x5. Be sure to eat a caloric excess and especially lots of protein (1 gram per pound of total bodyweight, per day), and to get enough sleep/rest. 

When doing a (standing, overhead) press as described in Starting Strength, are your elbows supposed to stay in a vertical plane, under your hands and in front of your hands (more or less), staying at the same distance from each other as you press the bar up? Or should they travel out, away from each other some, during the movement? When I do it, my elbows tend to flare out some. I think this changes the muscle recruitment in the exercise. I'm not sure if this is a form error that I should correct (reducing the weight if needed), or if I should just ignore it. I didn't see this fully addressed in Starting Strength, but I may have missed it. Rippetoe talks at length about a proper vertical bar path, and all the photos of people doing the lifts are profile shots, never straight on. Thanks. 

I've been running for a few years now, but I still struggle with speedwork. I use an online training plan generator that takes previous race time and distance, target race distance, weekly distance, and schedule duration to generate a running plan that includes easy runs, tempo runs, speedwork, and rest or cross-training days. My training plan is based on a four week cycle. Monday is an easy run, Tuesday is an easy run on weeks 1-3 and rest/XT on week 4, Wednesday is speedwork on week 1 and 3 or tempo run on week 2 or an easy run on week 4, Thursday is an easy run, Friday is rest or cross train, Saturday is long run, and Sunday is rest or cross train. The plan also builds speed throughout, across all the workouts. Distance also increases. Total weekly distances range from 22 miles/week to 35 miles/week. The plan deviates slightly at the end, close to the race. When I'm on a treadmill, I tend to adjust the plan paces based on something like this conversion chart to account for the fact it's slightly easier to run on a treadmill than outside. I rarely take a rest day, opting for strength training and/or some time on an elliptical (usually strength + 15 minutes elliptical but sometimes 30 minutes elliptical or 30 minutes arc trainer). I do tend to take the rest days as rest days early on in the plan (which is usually following a race), very late in the plan (the week or two before a race), or if I'm not feeling well for any reason to avoid pushing myself too hard. To give an idea of where I stand, my 5k PR is 29:00, my 10k PR is 1:09:51, my 15k PR is 1:57:21, and my half PR is 2:35:07. Unfortunately, last year, I was coming off an injury. I was healed before the spring, but my winter training was almost nonexistent so my times were far worse. Last years times were 32:55 for 5k (April 2016), 1:17:35 for 10k (June 2016), and 2:53:03 for a half (November 2016). Based on my training, I'm edging close to a 5k PR this coming April. My easy runs on a treadmill are recently around 10:50-11:10/mile. I could probably even push that up a little and be comfortable. I've only had the weather for one good outdoor run, and it was an easy run around 11:30/mile. My tempo runs are around 3-4 miles long and I'm running at around 9:40/mile. Even though my easy and tempo runs distances and times are projecting a near PR, my speedwork runs are terrible. Today, I was scheduled for a speedwork run that consisted of a warm up, and 5 0.5 mile intervals at 8:20/mile, each followed by a 0.25 mile recovery interval (I used a pace of about 11:30/mile), and a cooldown for a total distance of 6 miles. By the middle of the third speed interval, I was physically worn down. Am I doing something wrong in my speedwork if I'm able to complete my easy and tempo runs on plan (and sometimes better than plan), yet struggle with my planned speedwork? What can I do to specifically improve my speedwork without huge deviations from my plan which is tailored to my upcoming 5k race? Are there any modifications I can make on training days that call for speedwork? 

I think that cyclists might do that, but it isn't necessarily optimal training. When I was cycling more (on road) I was advised to spend a lot of time (read: up to 4+ hours at a time) at <70% of my max heart rate, then once I was conditioned, include short bursts of speed at rates above my lactic threshold. There was a notion from more experienced cyclists that what you're trying to do (which is very common) is simultaneously too much and too little. Its too intense to train your aerobic capacity, but also too moderate to really train your lactic threshold, V02 Max, or max leg strength. That being said, that's only comparing it to an optimal training schedule for experienced road bikers. If you're having fun and feel like you're getting better, keep doing it. I would recommend that you try and be aware of signs of overtraining - if you feel like you're not recovering between rides, or you're starting to pick up aches and pains that feel like their not going away before its time to ride again, or if you just find that you're getting slower and less explosive, you may want to reduce your pace or weekly mileage. I'd recommend that you research beginner training plans for cyclists. I know that Bicycling Magazine published a nice small book for beginning road bikers, and they may have a good one for mountain bikers too. You'll get a lot better if you're following an established training plan than if you just go out and beat yourself up. :) EDIT - I can't speak to the potential long term negative effects of keeping your heart rate that high for that long. Whether it exists at all, or to what extent it does / doesn't matter to people of different ages. That's outside the scope of the training literature I read, or my experiences of those of the other (20-something) cyclists I used to know. The only thing I could say is that if you're feeling short term symptoms of overtraining, your odds of doing something bad are likely higher. 

"Explosiveness" refers to the rate and efficiency of neuromuscular recruitment: how quickly, thoroughly, and intensely you can cause your muscles to contract. This is largely determined by your genes. Consider training for strength via heavy squats and deadlifts. Stronger muscles produce more force than weaker muscles, and therefore can produce greater bodily acceleration. Please note that strength training (coupled with proper recovery: food and sleep) probably will increase your muscular bodyweight, but this will not reduce your explosiveness, because muscle is obviously able to lift itself. 

This program could be improved by using incrementally and progressively increasing load(s) instead of relatively-constant (body) weight loads. The lack of progressive overload in this program is its primary serious deficiency for strength-training purposes. Low-bar back squats. 

Possibly, yes; however, you have no way to determine whether you can squat and deadlift 1.5x your bodyweight unless you actually do so, which is best accomplished by training your squat and deadlift.
