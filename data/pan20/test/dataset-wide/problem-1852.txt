Have you given up on teaching? You need to be honest with yourself and potential employers. When January rolls around, what are you going to do if you don't love your new job, are you going back to school? It's not fair to the employer to use them as an experiment. You need to commit to something if you expect them to commit to you. If you make misleading changes to your resume to get the interview and this comes up in discussion, that is just as likely to keep you from getting a job. Trust is important, can they trust what you are telling them? Can they trust that you are serious about making this job work? Sometimes it is amazing how small the work world is. You could very easily run into any of these contacts again in the future. You don't want to damage your reputation while trying to sort out what you really want to work on. Be up front with the information and believe that in the long run things will work out. 

How far from home are you? Could this just be related to the distance you travelled? Jet lag? I once had to fly to India (from the US) for three weeks. It took 3-4 days for my body to adjust to the time change and the new food. Until then I felt very similar to what you describe. You should certainly speak to your supervisor about your concerns, but you may want to give it a chance, maybe by staying longer and letting your body adjust. From your comments, it looks like you are the best person for the job based on skills and experience, so it would be good for you and the company to try to succeed. 

I think it is important that you understand how your boss views your role and your future. In the question and comments you consider your team members to be your equals. However, delegate usually implies giving work to someone below you. If you are in a position to delegate to them, they are not your equals. It may be a team effort to get the work done, but if you are the one deciding what gets delegated and to whom, you are no longer equals. You need to clarify this before you can really know how to proceed. 

You should handle this through your recruiter or HR contact at the company. While it was fine to work out the details of the time and phone numbers for execution of the interview directly with the interviewer when there are technology problems, that should probably be the end of the direct interaction with the interviewer. Depending on the size and make up of the company, it is quite likely that it is HR or the recruiter's job to manage feedback and status communications, not the interviewer. More likely than not, the interviewer has plenty of non-hiring work to take care of, while those functions are why HR and the recruiter are in the process. 

There is a big difference between I want a job and I want this job. They are looking to find how motivated you will be to do a good job. Are you motivated by the technology, the problem domain, maximizing the money or maybe you are just desperate for a job and a blasting out resumes everywhere. Your long term prospects are as much dependent on your attitude and motivation as they are on your skills, which they can see in your resume. 

Look around you and see if there is there is some task or process that you could improve by writing some new software. Research it and propose it to them. This will demonstrate initiative on your part and (hopefully) impress them even more. If they let you work on it, you can provide added value to the company and this will be a great thing to have on your resume. When I am hiring/interviewing, I am more impressed by someone who identified a problem solved it, then someone who just did the tasks they were assigned. 

Depends a lot on the size of the company. If the company is small enough, I would go with the attitude of do whatever needs to get done. As long as it is in the office during something like normal work hours, work on whatever he asks for. People working in small companies need to be more flexible if the company is going to succeed. Often small business owners do a large amount of business work off hours at home. If the owner needs his home computer working in order to help keep the business running smoothly, do you really want to stand in the way of that? If the request is to go to his/her home outside of work hours, I think you should still consider doing it, but I would hope that the owner recognizes the extra effort implied in that request. 

Since you say they are co-workers, I am assuming that these people work WITH you, not FOR you. If that is the case, your manager is asking you to do the negative parts of his job. This is inappropriate and you should discuss this with your boss. If this does not work, you should probably speak with your HR department, since your manager is putting you in a bad spot and your coworkers could actually report you to HR for how you are behaving towards them. 

This sentiment would concern me. Unless you are building an app for yourself, there is always going to be some client, customer or boss defining the software that you need to build. You may have an opportunity to have input on that spec, but you are going to have to deliver to some set of requirements. When you look at the total number of development jobs out there, there is a very small percentage that is truly "good of mankind" product development. If you have already worked in some positions like that and still couldn't find meaning we may not be able to help you more than that. As others have suggested, you need to be able find meaning in the way that your software helps somebody in some way. Remember they wouldn't pay you to do it if it wasn't useful/meaningful for others in some way. It's up to you to find the opportunity/company where that usefulness meshes with your desire for meaning and purpose. 

You are probably correct, and that is why you can't do much about it yourself. Whether you stay or go, it appears the company has mishandled this project. Your departure won't change that fact. If the company gets sued I don't think it will be because you left. If the company is large enough to withstand this lawsuit and survive, it won't matter if you leave. If the company can not withstand this lawsuit, one person more or less is probably not going to make a difference. I think it is commendable that you are concerned about the impact on your co-workers, but this is really management's problem, and the best you can do is save yourself from the future pain.
