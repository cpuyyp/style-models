Those are Service Ribbons, which denote which medals a soldier has been awarded without having the medals themselves displayed on their uniform. Yours appears to be from a British or Commonwealth soldier during World War 2. Your ribbons are from a Polish Soldier operating under British Commonwealth Command in Italy during World War 2, possibly as part of the II Corps (found by extrapolating from your username). The medals these represent (that I have found are), 

I am not certain of the fifth ribbon's identity, but it seems to match, and it is possible that it could have been awarded after September 8th when Italy signed the armistice and joined the Allies. 

Clockwise from the top of the star (left side of the picture) - France, Belgium, Russia, Italy, UK Which corresponds to the major Allied Powers in WW1 before the entry of the United States and the exit of Russia. The Russian Symbol is a bit hard to identify, but it was probably chosen to differentiate the Flag of Russia from the French Tricolor, since the orientations of the flags seem variable for this card. 

During WW2, submarines on patrol were out of contact with friendly forces for extended periods of time. Even when operating in a Wolf-Pack, they generally couldn't tell exactly where their pack-mates were or how they were doing. While they could broadcast their status using their radios, this was limited to avoid radio intercepts and direction finding giving away their presence in an area. This meant that more often than not, the first indication that a boat was lost was either a boat missing a radio check-in or the boat being overdue on returning to port (an example of this is the Wahoo). However, without confirmation of the boat actually being lost, they would still be marked as On Patrol. Removing the boat would be admitting the boat, and its crew, were gone. Leaving it as On Patrol turned into a mark a of respect for those lost, and the tradition stuck. 

Mathematicians are better at mathematics than at history, and have perpetuated an error concerning what Euclid did. They frequently state in textbooks and elsewhere that Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers is by contradiction. But it is not. Euclid considered what happens if you multiply finitely many prime numbers and then add 1. For example: (2 × 11 × 37) + 1 = 815 The number you get cannot be divisible by any of the finitely many prime numbers you started with. 815 cannot be divisible by 2 because 814 is; 815 cannot be divisible by 11 because 814 is; 814 cannot be divisible by 37 because 814 is. (The next prime number after 814 that is divisible by 37 is 814+37; the next after 814 that is divisible by 11 is 814+11; the next after 814 that is divisible by 2 is 814+2.) Therefore, whichever prime numbers 815 is divisible by, whether it is prime itself or not, cannot be among the finitely many you started with (in this example 2, 11, and 37). (In fact 815 is 5 × 163, and 5 and 163 are prime.) In this way it is seen that every finite list of prime numbers can be extended to a longer finite list of prime numbers. That is how Euclid prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. Catherine Woodgold and I wrote a joint paper in which we refuted the historical error and explained some practical reasons why it matters: Michael Hardy and Catherine Woodgold, "Prime Simplicity", Mathematical Intelligencer, volume 31, number 4, fall 2009, pages 44–52. I learned only after the paper appeared that the historical error may have originated with Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. It appears in his posthumous book on number theory. 

After WW2, the German currency (The Reichsmark) took a large hit in value, both due to losing the war, and the Soviets continuing to print RMs (precisely to prevent the economic recovery of Germany). The Western Governments, to facilitate the recovery of (Western) Germany introduced the Deutsche Mark (DM), which the Soviets disapproved of, banning the use of the DM in the eastern sector, while introducing their own new currency for their sector. Due to Berlin's status as an enclave within the Soviet zone, the Western Allies did not initially introduce the DM to Berlin, seeking a agreement with the Soviets. As the Soviets were against the new currency in general, they refused, and decided to introduce their new currency to their sector, including Berlin. This led to the West introducing the DM to their sectors of Berlin The introduction of the DM to Berlin was what precipitated the Blockade, and one of the goals of the Soviets was to force West Berlin to adopt the Eastern Currency. By forcing the West Berliners to purchase food from the east, the Soviets would have insured that the only currency they could use was theirs. Due to the success of the Airlift, this was never required of West Berlin, which kept the DM over the East Mark. The precipitating reason for the blockade is on page 18 of Miller's To Save a City. 

There's no clear-cut definitive answer for this as most battles involved mass ranks of soldiers and not individual targets. Archers would be trained to shoot at groups of enemy and not individuals, at least not at any great range. The English/Welsh Longbow of the early 15th century, had a range of up to 350 yds or so, but it was only considered effective at up to around 200 yds. This doesn't take into account armour worn by the enemy. For example a knight in full plate armour would probably be impervious to the Longbow at ranges of much above 50 yds, depending on the type of arrowhead used. $URL$ $URL$ 

As World War Two progressed, Hitler ordered the formation of more and more "SS" or "Schutzstaffel" divisions. I am aware that these units often had priority for reinforcements and supplies, but how effective were they in combat compared to non-SS formations? Did they have better/more training for example? Was it cost-effective for Germany to have so many SS units later in the war? 

Air superiority wasn't really in question for the Allies in mid-1944 over Western Europe and so the extra aircraft that would have been provided weren't necessary. The Allies had thousands of aircraft operating from airfields not far away in southern England - a few hundred more from aircraft carriers wouldn't have been all that helpful. Carrier based aircraft were not as good at their jobs as land-based aircraft, for example the best fighters of the day, the Spitfire and Mustang could not operate from carriers. No large bombers could operate from carriers. The English Channel is quite a confined stretch of water and it was absolutely stuffed full of ships around D-Day, carriers are large vessels that would have struggled to operate in such confines. All the carriers the Allies had were busy elsewhere, in the Pacific for example. The Allies were worried about mines in the channel and wouldn't want to lose such a valuable ship as a carrier to a mine. 

During the first world war all of Ireland was within the United Kingdom. In C. S. Lewis's autobiographical book Surprised by Joy he says that as an Irishman (from Belfast) he was exempt from conscription during the first world war. (He joined the army and was wounded in combat, and many of his schoolmates were killed.) I am guessing that attempts to conscript Irishmen at that time might have been resisted with widespread violence, but that's just a guess. Why were they exempt? 

Wikipedia's article titled Catholic Church and slavery says Saint Patrick advocated abolition of slavery in the fifth century, and cites Life in Medieval Times by Marjorie Rowling. I've read that same assertion in other places. Where is this in Saint Patrick's writings? 

In the 18th century, if I understand correctly, the king of England appointed the governors of the thirteen colonies in North America. How far beyond royal appointments of governors did British rule extend? One obvious answer is that in the 1760s the British Parliament began trying to impose taxes on Americans --- money to be sent from America to Britain. Another is that when Britain went to war against France in 1756, colonial Americans helped the British conquer the French colony of Canada. After the taxation laws of the 1760s some American statesmen took the position that the colonies had their own legislatures and, although they were subjects of the same king as the British, and the king therefore appointed their governors, the British Parliament had no more right to legislate for America the the Virginia House of Burgesses had to legislate for England. So a question is: before the tax acts, how extensive was legislation by Parliament that was intended to be enforced in America, and how effective was the enforcement? Added somewhat later: Another instance of governing from England was the order-in-council signed by King George III on July 20, 1764, stating that the disputed territory claimed by both New York and New Hampshire belonged to New York. That disputed territory is what later became the state of Vermont. The ruling followed an ex-parte hearing, i.e. the king and council heard from only one side: the province of New York. Then in 1767 a further order was issued in response to a petition from the inhabitants of the "New Hampshire Grants", as that territory was then called, saying the province of New York ought to recognize New Hampshire land grants issued before the order-in-council of 1764. However, this was clearly not routine governance.
