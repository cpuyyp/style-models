To evaluate the cogency of MacIntyre's claim goes beyond what can be done in an SE answer--you'd need to read his account of those attempts and decide for yourself whether his negative evaluation is warranted. edit: also generally marxist theorists are critical of human rights discourse, seeing it as a bourgeois ruse to deny equality to the proletariat. 

Because he provides a logical framework within which to understand what it means to say that a thing has some property necessarily. Call this view essentialism. Quine had thought that essentialism was false because necessity could only be a property of sentences. (So there could be necessary truths, but not necessary properties of objects.) Quine's reason for saying this was that there are logical paradoxes that appear to arise if we attribute necessary properties to objects. For instance: 

Quick question: Does the SCOTUS hold that the state isn't liable here just because the officers have a duty to intervene as far as the state is concerned? (i.e. there are standing orders like, "if you see an assault, stop it") If so, then it seems reasonable to hold the state blameless, and instead shift blame to the individual officer who is disobeying orders in this case. If the state says the officer should intervene and he doesn't, then it isn't the state who should be blamed. I don't know the answer to the question, but it seems relevant to the issue. 

The short answer is no: if something's logically impossible, then it isn't going to happen, not no way, not no how. The distinction between logical possibility and other kinds is a little subtle though. It is possible to distinguish various kinds of possibility. 

This question is off topic here, but I happen to know the answer. Early Christian thinkers divided the laws and commands of the Old Testament into three categories: the moral, the civil and the ceremonial. Moral commands are those expressing general rules about conduct "thou shalt not commit adultery" and these remain in force, even under Christianity. The civil commands were the laws of the nation of Israel that God set up for their good in their particular place and time. The command to release all debts every seven years is an example. These do not remain in effect, since the Chrostian kingdoms were conscious of themselves living in a new time and a new place and needing therefore new laws adapted to their situation---although analogies could be drawn between civil laws of the Old Testament to justify new policies. See the debates about the divine right of kings. Finally the ceremonial laws of the OT were those having to do specifically with the priestly sacrificial system of the OT, like laws describing which garments the Levites were supposed to wear. These laws don't remain in effect, for Chrisitians, precisely because that sacrificial system has been abolished and replace with the Church, with a new set of customs and ceremonies, such as the Eucharist. 

I have a Chinese friend. No one who has a Chinese friend is racist against Chinese people. Therefore, I am not racist against Chinese people. 

Olbers did publish his discoveries: including finding several comets and then the paradox. Ayn Rand, on the other hand, published her most "important" philosophical contributions in her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology in her own journal. In other words, she didn't gain any creditability by having her ideas critically examined and vetted by others; so of course nobody in the academic community took her seriously. Self-publication is self-defeat, because the point of publishing is to gain external validation from others. So what does it take to get a paper published in those top journals? 

That sounded wrong to me. I don't understand what a thought-axis is supposed to be, but more importantly "being connected" and "being indiscernible" are clearly two radically different concepts. Two things A and B are indiscernible when and only when every property of A's is also a property of B's and vice versa. I'm connected to lots of stuff--my computer with which I'm typing, the air which I'm breathing, etc. But I'm not indiscernible from anything but myself. Here's a property I have that the air I breathe doesn't--I'm a human being, and the air isn't. From this it follows that the air and I are distinct. 

I think you're trying to say something like this: Every question and answer have a subject matter. The more objective the subject matter is, the more likely an answer to a question about that subject matter is to be either "yes" or "no". I don't really think that's right, because I don't think it's a matter of the objectivity of the subject matter, per se, that is at stake. It's a matter of being able to ask well-defined questions that permit of well-defined answers. There are subjective-ish subject matters about which well defined questions can be asked. "Is Milton a better poet than Blake?" The answer to that question is either yes or no--regardless of how anybody happens to feel about it. The difficulty is coming up with objective criteria by which to tell which case obtains. Perhaps in some general sense objectivity of subject matter tracks well-definedness of questions, but I think we'd need to see some argument for that. Here's another thought--maybe it is the ability to figure out decision procedures for well-defined questions that lead us to gain objective knowledge about some subject areas . . . 

I maintain that it doesn't make sense to simply "create your own meaning in life". I have come across this view, which is generally held by most humanists, pretty often, and it doesn't seem to make much sense to me. I'll try and explain. When we talk of meaning in life, we generally mean some sense of larger purpose that we can hang on to, despite ups and down, so that our lives are lived out in some kind of harmony to our environment. Meaning can either be given to you, or it can be created. However, if it is created, we are left with a problem, and that is the problem of the choice itself. There are many problems with choosing one's own meaning (for example, how do you reason with a person whose meaning in life is to get drunk and fall into a ditch?), but the biggest problems is that if we select a meaning in life like we choose a meal at an all-you-can-eat or buffet, then the very fact that we are choosing reduces what could have been a larger purpose to something that is much smaller i.e. my whim. In summary, I conclude that meaning or purpose can be handed to you, as done in traditional cultures, or Christianity, or as possibly done in some totalitarian societies. But to say that you are creating your own meaning is a bit of a contradiction. How would a humanist answer this? 

The specific example I am thinking of is that of Google and the web: It seems as if, in an effort to stamp out content farms, Google has to add complexity to its algorithm. Now, does that added complexity make it tougher for legitimate websites to go higher up in the rankings? I'm very interested in knowing if anyone has written more extensively about this. 

Short answer: Philosophy is the wrong department for this. Try spiritually instead. Ask in Christianity.stackexchange is my suggestion. Long answer: You've stumbled on a question that would be answered differently by each worldview. Atheism is one such worldview. Christianity is another. Yet another is Hinduism. As a former Hindu, former atheist, and current Christian, I'll try and answer according to each of these views. Hinduism: Hinduism is a religion that broadly says that the world is an illusion, and that our desires for the impermanent things ought to be minimized. Ways to minimize this may include doing yoga, meditating, ritualistic prayers(poojas), etc. Atheism: While there may be atheistic philosophers who have advocated being in control of one's desires, I'm not sure what arguments they may have put forward for why one should do this. If the material world is all there is, then why should one way, the way of moderation and temperance, be any better than any other way, apart from appeals to pure pragmatism? Even then it is not clear why I, as an evolved creature, should not gather so much for myself as to deprive my neighbor of those same resources, so that I am better off, but he or she is worse off. Christianity: Christianity says that ever since the fall of mankind, we have a fundamental inclination towards sin, which includes idolatory and covetousness. Moreover, our hearts are darkened without knowledge of the goodness of God, which causes us to fear for our own provision. This, in turn, inclines us towards gathering and hoarding more for ourselves than we really need. The solution, according to Christianity, is that we need to trust in Christ for our salvation, which results in a new birth, which restores or redeems our fallen nature, so that we are free to live according to God's desires for us. I'll stop for want of time. I just wanted you to see that the question you have posed indeed does touch upon spirituality, and that in order to properly answer it, you need to go down one of these mutually exclusive paths. 

Mew has given a very pragmatic answer, but doesn't raise the thorny philosophical problem. I'd like to add my two cents.. There a few problems with the genetic selection and modification of human beings. The biggest problem is the desacralizing of life. I have a small observation that I will probably develop more fully somewhere else, and that is this: With the desacralizing of life, death, sex, marriage, not only do we lose out on living meaningful lives, but we also lose out on the ability to know God, because ultimately the questions of objective meaning and purpose of life are inextricably intertwined with questions of the nature and existence of God. I think that this spiritual dulling of the senses, if I can put it that way, is already in progress across much of the "developed" world. There are other problems too. For example, suppose we were to be able to design offspring who wouldn't suffer from any adverse health conditions. Would they be as empathetic to another person's suffering? I have to be clear, I don't want to sound glib about suffering (I myself have had more than my fair share of it). But we may have to admit that the elimination of suffering of all kinds cannot be the ultimate purpose of life, because if successful, it could change the very nature of life itself. As for the article linked to above, again there are pragmatic reasons why it is unwise to screen embryos for potential personality flaws. But I'll just mention a more philosophical reason: Within the Christian view, an individual has free will. I have no doubt that people have different proclivities and weaknesses, but learning how to deal with these is a part of our human experience. It is what makes us unlike robots. In short, people who choose to turn their back on a religiously based arguments against these kinds of modifications merely because they are religiously based are showing a dangerous kind of cultural bias which is myopic and foolish. Humanity as we know it can morph into something less glorious in the blink of an eye.
