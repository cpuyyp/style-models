The identity $G(s)\zeta(s) = \zeta(s-2)$ has an easy direct proof: We are being asked to show that $$\sum_{d \geq 1} \frac{J_2(d)}{d^s} \sum_{e \geq 1} \frac{1}{e^s} = \sum_{n \geq 1} \frac{n^2}{n^s}$$ or, in other words, $$\sum_{d|n} J_2(d) = n^2.$$ The right hand side is the number of elements of $(\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z})^2$; the left hand side is the number of those elements with order $d$. I don't see a good combinatorial interpretation of the fact that $\frac{\zeta(s-2)}{\zeta(s)} = \frac{\zeta(s-2)}{\zeta(s-1)} \frac{\zeta(s-1)}{\zeta(s)}$. 

A genuine smooth solution would be like this, but would interpolate smoothly between these two. If you push forward in a brute force manner, you'll get something with bump functions in it. If you are more clever, you may discover the solution $$\theta_1 = \frac{dz}{z} \left( 1- \frac{1}{1+z \overline{z}} \right)$$ and $$\theta_2 = - \frac{dz}{z} \left( \frac{1}{1+z \overline{z}} \right).$$ You should check that $\theta_1|_{V_1} - \theta_2|_{V_2} = dz/z$ and that $\theta_i$ is smooth and well-defined on $U_i$. Then $$\overline{\partial} \theta_1 = \overline{\partial} \theta_2 = \frac{dz \ d\overline{z}} {(1+z \overline{z})^2}.$$ This is, as Scott guessed, the Fubini-Study form. 

$\def\cO{\mathcal{O}}$ I can give a positive answer for $H^0$ in the case that $S = \mathrm{Spec} A$ for a graded ring $A$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is the sheaf associated to a graded $A$-module. The proof will consist of a number of elementary reductions, followed by a result of Atiyah, ad then some more elementary arguments. Since $A$ is normal, we know that $\mathrm{Proj} \ A$ is a smooth curve $X$. Let $g$ be the genus of $X$; let $\cO(1)$ be the line bundle on $X$ coming from the graded ring $A$; let $k$ be the degree of $\cO(1)$. These are all constants. For any vector bundle $E$ on $X$, the section module is $$\Gamma(E) := \bigoplus_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} H^0(X, E \otimes \cO(n)).$$ Section modules are reflexive and every graded reflexive $A$-module is the section module of a vector bundle. The rank of $\Gamma(E)$ is the rank of the vector bundle $E$, which we will call $r$. Step 1: We may assume that $E$ is not a direct sum of lower rank vector bundles. This is because $\Gamma$ and $\otimes_A k$ both commute with direct sum so, if we can bound the irreducible case, we just have to add together our bounds for each partition of $r$. Let $d$ be the degree of $E$. Step 2: We may assume that $0 \leq d < kr$. This is because tensoring with $\cO(1)$ shifts $d$ by $kr$ and gives the same section module up to a grading shift, so we get the zero fiber after this tensoring operation. Step 3: Here is where we pull out the early parts of Atiyah's "Vector Bundles over an Elliptic Curve". As explained in section I.4 of Atiyah's paper, $E$ has a filtration $0=E_0 \subset E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \cdots E_r=E$ such that $E_i/E_{i-1}$ is a line bundle $L_i$ and the degrees of the $L_i$ obey $$|\deg L_i - \deg L_1| \leq C_1(g,r)$$ for a constant depending only on $g$ and $r$ (Atiyah's lemmas 4 and 6). Since $\sum \deg L_i = d$, we can rewrite this as $$|\deg L_i - d/r | \leq C_2(g,r).$$ (This uses that $E$ is not a nontrivial direct sum, as this is a standing assumption for Atiyah.) Since $0 \leq d \leq kr$, we can rewrite this as $$|\deg L_i| \leq C_3(g,r,k).$$ So there are only finitely many sequences $(\deg L_1, \cdots, \deg L_r)$. We will prove a bound for each one. Step 4: We prove the following result by induction on $r$: Continue to fix the genus $g$ of $X$. Let $(d_1, \ldots, d_r)$ be a given sequence of integers. Then there are constants $P$ and $Q$, and a sequence of integers $(C_P, C_{P+1}, \ldots, C_Q)$, such that, for any vector bundle $E$ on $X$ with a filtration of degree sequence $(d_i)$, the zero fiber of $\Gamma(E)$ is supported in grades between $P$ and $Q$, and the part in grade $i$ has dimension at most $C_i$. The base case, $r=0$, is vacuous. So, let $E$ lie in a short exact sequence $0 \to L \to E \to E' \to 0$, where we have bounds of the assumed form for $E'$ and we know the degree of $L$. We will, of course, be using the short exact sequences $$0 \to H^0(L \otimes \cO(n)) \to H^0(E \otimes \cO(n)) \to H^0(E' \otimes \cO(n)) \to H^1(L \otimes \cO(n))$$ for various values of $n$. When $n$ is negative enough, meaning less than $-\deg L$ and less than $P'$, then the first and third term vanish, so the second one does as well and we get no contribution in those grades. When $n$ is positive enough, meaning larger than $2g-\deg L$, the fourth term vanishes. So, for $n$ slightly larger than that, we have a complex with exact rows: $$\begin{matrix} 0 & \to & H^0(L \otimes \cO(n-1)) \otimes H^0(\cO(1)) &\to& H^0(E \otimes \cO(n-1)) \otimes H^0(\cO(1)) &\to& H^0(E' \otimes \cO(n-1)) \otimes H^0(\cO(1)) &\to& 0 \\ & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \\ 0 & \to & H^0(L \otimes \cO(n)) &\to& H^0(E \otimes \cO(n)) &\to& H^0(E' \otimes \cO(n-1)) &\to& 0 \\ \end{matrix}$$ For large enough $n$, we inductively know that the third column is surjective; for $n$ larger than $-\deg L + 2g$, the first column is (by the standard Riemman-Roch argument). So, by the snake lemma, we get that the middle column is surjective for large enough $n$, and there is no contribution to the zero fiber in that degree. We are left bounding the size of the zero fiber in the intermediate degrees. We can just bound the size of $\Gamma(E)$ itself. From Riemman-Roch, $\dim H^0(X, E \otimes \cO(n)) \leq (d+rk) - r(g-1)$, and we are done. 

If you have a lot of duplicate rows (and you know what they are), you can reduce to a smaller matrix. I'll start with an example, because writing out the general case will be notationally annoying. Let $$A = \begin{pmatrix} a & a & b & c \\ a & a & b & c \\ b & b & d & e \\ c & c & e & f \end{pmatrix}$$ Then $A$ has a zero eigenvalue, and the other eigenvalues are the same as those of $$A'=\begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \sqrt{2} & c \sqrt{2} \\ b \sqrt{2} & d & e \\ c \sqrt{2} & e & f \end{pmatrix}$$ Proof: Let $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$ be the orthonormal vectors $(1/\sqrt{2}, 1/\sqrt{2}, 0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$ and $(0,0,0,1)$. Complete to an orthonormal basis $(v_1, v_2, v_3, w)$. Then $A$ annihilates $w$, and takes $\mathrm{Span}(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ to itself by the matrix $A'$. In general, if $I$ is a set of rows which are identical, then let $v_I$ be the vector which is $1/\sqrt{|I|}$ on the coordinates in $I$ and $0$ elsewhere. The $v_I$ are orthonormal, complete them to an orthonormal basis by adding vectors $w_j$. Then $A$ will annihilate the $w_j$ and will take $\mathrm{Span}(v_I)$ to itself. The matrix of endomorphism of $\mathrm{Span}(v_I)$ will have entries that look like $\sqrt{IJ} \cdot a_{ij}$, with $i \in I$ and $j \in J$. So you ar reduced to computing the eigenvalues of this smaller matrix. 

This answer is inspired by JBL's comment on Aaron's answer: Fix $n$, so that I don't have to include it in my notation. In all other respects, copy Aaron's notation. JBL observes that there appear to be numbers $f(1)$, $f(2)$, ..., $f(n-1)$ such that $$ p_{\lambda} = \sum_{k \in \lambda} f(k). \quad \quad (*)$$ We will show that such $f$'s exist, and give formulas for them. In particular, it will be clear that $f(1) = (n-1)^2/n$, proving the result. For convenience, we set $f(0)=f(n)=0$. 

E. Kowalski just put up a nice blogpost about this subject. In particular, he gives the interesting counter-example $A_5 \ltimes (\mathbb{Z}/2)^4$ and asks for a conceptual proof that it works. 

Let $\Gamma$ be a finite group of order $p^n$. Is there necessarily a unipotent algebraic group $G$ of dimension $n$, defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$, with $\Gamma \cong G(\mathbb{F}_p)$? I have no real motivation for this question, it just came up in conversation and no one knew the answer. There does not appear to be any sort of uniqueness to $G$; both the groups $\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \mathbb{Z}$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z})^2$ have infinitely many lifts to unipotent groups. 

I disagree with this statement. Consider $9$ points in the plane, called $x(i,j)$ where $(i,j)$ is in $\{ 0,1,2 \}$. There are $12$ triples $((i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), (i_3, j_3))$ such that $i_1 + i_2 + i_3 \equiv 0 \mod 3$ and $j_1 + j_2 + j_3 \equiv 0 \mod 3$. Let $L$ be the set of such triples. Consider the following statement: 

If $k= \mathbb{F}_2$, I will show that this implies the axiom of choice for pairs. Suppose $k(X)$ has a basis and let $f$ be a basis element. For any $x$ and $y$ in $X$, let $c(x,y)$ be the coefficient of $f$ in $\frac{x}{x+y} f$. Since $\frac{x}{x+y} f + \frac{y}{x+y} f = f$, we have $c(x,y)+c(y,x)=1$, so one of $c(x,y)$ and $c(y,x)$ is $0$ and the other is $1$; this gives a choice function $X^2 \to X$. On the other hand, I believe I can show $k(X)$ has a basis without choice whenever $k$ has characteristic zero. It's a long one -- I'll try to write it up later tonight. 

Allen Knutson, Thomas Lam and I prove this in an Appendix we have recently added to our paper Projections of Richardson Varieties. Many thanks to Michel Brion and Shrawan Kumar for helping us by e-mail. 

I would write "Proposition Z: If X holds, then Y is true." Even if the deduction of Y from X were trivial, I think labelling this a corollary would be confusing. (After all, what is the statement "X implies Y" a corollary of?) However, I wouldn't have a problem writing something like "as we saw above, Y would be a corollary of X" later on. (The subjunctive voice is important here!) 

Yes, this is a field norm; it is the norm of $a + b \sqrt{3} + c \sqrt{5} + d \sqrt{15}$, from $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$ down to $\mathbb{Q}$. Note that $a+b \sqrt{3} + c \sqrt{5} + d \sqrt{15}$ acts on the basis $(1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{15})$ by $$a \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + b \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + c \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + d \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 15 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Now conjugate by the matrix whose diagonal entries are $(1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{15})$ to get your matrix. The entries are no longer rational, so I can't think of the result as describing the action on $K$, but the determinant is the same. $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{15})$ has class number $2$ and $K$ is the class field. So, for a prime $p$ other than $2$, $3$, $5$, we have that $\pm p$ is a value of $x^2-15 y^2$ if and only if $p$ splits principally in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{15})$ if and only if $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $\pm p$ is a value of $f$. Also, neither $x^2-15 y^2$ nor $f$ can be $3 \bmod 4$, so the sign is the same in the two cases. However, they don't take the same set of composite values. Look at $-119 = 7 \times 17$. We have $61^2 - 15 \cdot 16^2 = -119$, but, if $7 | f(a,b,c,d)$ then $7^2 | f(a,b,c,d)$. I found this by hunting for two primes which are non-principally split in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{15})$. In terms of quadratic forms, which I know you love, I needed primes of the form $3 x^2 - 5 y^2$, and I found $7=3 \cdot 2^2 - 5$ and $-17 = 3 \cdot 6^2 - 5 \cdot 5^2$. Then their product was of the form $x^2-15 y^2$. Since these primes split non principally in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{15})$, they don't split further in the class field. (We can also directly compute $\left( \frac{3}{7} \right) = \left( \frac{3}{17} \right) = -1$.) So things divisible by one power of $7$ or $17$ are not norms from $K$. 

Algebraic over $\mathbb{C}$ implies realizable over $\mathbb{C}$. If your matroid is algebraic over $\mathbb{C}$, then it is realizable over some $\mathbb{C} \subset K$, so it is realizable over the algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, which explicitly means that a list of equalities and inequalities over $\overline{K}$ has a solution. But then these equations and inequalities have a solution over $\mathbb{C}$ as well. 

Uggh, I lose. $7$ generic points in $\mathbb{P}^3$ don't lie on a rational normal curve, but apparently they DO lie on $3$ quadratics. (Because we are looking at the kernel of a $10 \times 7$ matrix.) That means there is some fun Chasles theorem stuff here: Any quadratic which passes through $7$ of the intersection points of three quadratics should pass through the $8$th. So my specific suggestion of using quadratics was wrong. I'd be glad to hear any suggestions as to what is right. 

Let me build a little on Gjergji's answer, using his terminology, in order to get closer to how I have usually heard Nakayama's lemma stated. Suppose, in addition, that $\mathbb{Fr}_p(G)$ is finitely generated and let $S \subseteq G$. Then, if the image of $S$ $P$-generates $G/\mathbb{Fr}_p(G)$, then $S$ $P$-generates $G$. (Hmm, it's not clear to me that $\mathbb{Fr}_p(G)$ is always normal in $\mathbb{Fr}_p(G)$, although it is in all of the examples so far. So we might need to add that as a hypothesis.) Proof: Let $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_r$ $P$-generate $\mathbb{Fr}_p(G)$. Then $G=\langle S, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_r \rangle_P$ (exercise!). Repeatedly using the definition of a nongenerator, $G = \langle S \rangle_P$. $\square$ 

Another example, different in flavour from the others: Let G be the set of affine linear transformations x --> ax+b over a finite field, and c the conjugacy class of [ax] for a \neq 1. Proof that this works: The conjugacy class of ax is the maps x --> ax+i, for i in Z/p. We need to show that, if H contains ax+i and ax+j then ax+i and ax+j are conjugate in H. Since H contains ax+i and ax+j, it contains their ratio, x+(j-i)/a. Therefore, H contains every map of the form x+k. Conjugating ax+i by x+(j-i)/(a-1) gives ax+j.
