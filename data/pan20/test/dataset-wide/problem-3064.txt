So once the Gold Rush began, and due to the massive immigration to the US due to the potato famine, I think you may have trouble narrowing down a single unnamed Irishman at this time in California history. 

So there appears to be no shortage of reports of Truman's piano use at the conference. As to Churchill's discomfort, it is also discussed in sources such as Presidential Diversions: Presidents at Play... By Paul F. Boller, where it quotes Churchill, the next day during the lengthy classical performance put on by Stalin's musicians, as saying 

We have laws to protect children now, but these prisoners had no such protection. They worked until they died. Since some children are quite resilient, some survived longer than others. Some survivors pictured on PBS. Perhaps you have seen Elie Wiesel speak, or read his books. He was 15. 

No mention here about it taking flight as projectiles, but it does exist in the area, and apparently was quite valuable to the locals. 

It later mentions that shooting outside the city walls was allowed, so it seems this was not a ban on the use of these weapons in war such as canon 29 seems to indicate, but just local ordinances to make it safer in the city limits. (The presence of archery and crossbow related guilds there would also seem to agree that military use was still allowed). So the above Flanders reference, though it did actually specifically include bows, seems to have little relation to the ban from the Second Council of the Lateran. 

The problem with respect to the Gastraphetes is that this ban and war occurred about 300 years before its invention. (Note that this ban, and indeed the entire battle, has been considered by some to be fictional.) 

We can conclude gypsum was historically used, and fatal consequences were known to occur if misused. It would be only logical to also list any counter-agents, no matter how common or uncommon the need may have been. Think of it as an "in case of poisoning, use this" type of protective instruction. 

A fairly recent book(2015),Genghis Khan and the Mongol War Machine By Chris Peers , gives us the following information: pg 69 

So £400,000. But this is just one source, so continuing to search, another book showed up discussing this:The History of the Public Revenue of the British Empire : Containing an Account of the Public Income and Expenditure from the Remotest Periods Recorded in History, to Michaelmas 1802; with a Review of the Financial Administration of the Right Honorable William Pitt. By Sir John Sinclair published 1803. On page 70 they get around to discussing the revenue collected by William: 

So besides the 'line' Companies, it may also have been typical to have a regiment Headquarters Company (Known as Headquarters and Headquarters in Army battalions. I Have not been able to find which of these other companies may have been stationed at Camp Lee, but it could very well have been a member of the same regiment as Company B. 

Concerning Flanders, which was another area mentioned as banning ranged weapons, this ban is brought up in the book Archery and Crossbow Guilds in Medieval Flanders, 1300-1500 By Laura Crombie. In this text,it states: 

Interestingly, I wrote a quick simulation of this, and can get to 29 in a row rather quickly, but to get to 32 it took several minutes: 

It looks like there are several versions of the 'threatening letter' sent to Qutuz. The version from the wiki about Qutuz has the following phrasing: 

A couple of points can be made concerning Anglo-Saxon 'use' of Roman ruins. If you look at the wiki article on Anglo-Saxon architecture, the general occupation of these areas is mentioned(emphasis mine): 

It seems the thought of Aegyptus out-producing Africa Proconsularis may be incorrect. We can find original ancient sources which indicate that it seems to have been the other way around, with North Africa providing 2/3 of Rome's grains. The reference providing this ratio, though lacking specific figures, can be found in Bellum Judaicum 2.383 by Josephus. 

It looks like this was literally soot taken from the furnace walls themselves, not the soda ash which was used as a flux in the Roman glassmaking process itself. from A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Volume 1 

According to the entry concerning the Southern Slavs it is quite probable that the common language source would be due to common ancestry: 

The second image, from a different room, may represent a similar sacrificial scene. From this article discussing sacrifices: 

Since the chambering is 41 Colt, I would agree that the black powder cartridges would be appropriate. The 41 Colt was created in 1877, and as such the original specifications called for black powder loads. The book The Modern American Pistol and Revolver, published in 1888, lists several loads for 41s: 

If the Heinlein story isn't based on the Poe story, they may have at least had a common source. No triumphant return in two years as Captain for Pym, but there was illness and mutiny, also mentioned as part of the background story in the note on the site brought up in comments by @Steve Bird. The Poe story's Wikipedia page says this: 

You may be thinking of Dacia and their Falx. The falx may have defeated Roman armor more by form and use(as a two-handed weapon) then by superior steel however. The book The Dacian Threat, by Michael Schmitz discusses this on page 39. Some of the upgrades caused included: 

Another work, Jehovah's Witnesses in National Socialist Concentration Camps, mentions small numbers of other denominations being classed with purple triangles: 

This may relate more to materials taken from publications by Jeremiah N. Reynolds concerning scientific expeditions and hollow earth theories, and/or from Benjamin Morrell's A Narrative of Four Voyages. There may be a common source for Poe's story and Heinlein's, but I haven't been able to come up with one. If theses stories are based on the same event, however, anyone continuing this research might focus before Poe's story was published in 1838. This was also asked on Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack . 

The goose reappears in similar form as part of the flag of a particular Contrade of Siena, the Oca contrade. Remember, this work was done as a fresco to record the History of the True Cross, and covers the walls of the Basilica of San Francesco in Arezzo Italy. It was never meant to be a historically accurate reenactment of a battle. It was painted around 1452 concerning the Battle of Neneveh, which took place in 627, so knowledge of the particular elements of the forces under Heraclius would have been limited at best. Other elements of the painting do not accurately represent the history of the battle, the faces of the people surrounding Khosrau II are actually the faces of the benefactors of the church, the Bacci family, and the representation of the beheading of Khosrau II is inaccurate in itself, according to the wiki article on the battle: 

The book Historic Spots in California: Fifth Edition claims the term moro was used to indicate anything black, and 

For the general animal group (and on earth), I'll put in Great Bear Lake. Area= 12,028 mi² (31,153 sq km ). It doesn't appear to be named after a specific bear however, so may not qualify. 

Since you recall reading an article which included the length of time to compllete an arrow, perhaps it was in the book With a Bended Bow: Archery in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe By Erik Roth. In this text, there is a section on manufacturing, which details the time involved to reproduce arrows such as those found in Nydam Bog. The time arrived at is about 2 hours per arrow, including: 

Most of the books written on Karl Doenitz seem to agree that he feigned insanity, in fact a couple of times: 

So as early as 1793 there was conflict with France over repayment of this debt. Several years later, after other issues such as the US signing of the Jay Treaty(1795), and the XYZ affair(1797-1798), this conflict actually boiled over into what is known as the 'Quasi-War'(1798-1800), with the fledgling US Navy engaging directly with the French. 

The above source has more information concerning the early explorations of this region, covering the Jesuits, French and British presences, and the Native Americans beliefs and legends concerning the copper deposits. 

This was, as noted a ceasefire, so the war did not 'officially' end until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles: 

The 1988 book The Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa By Dennis P. Kehoe, lists these sources (footnote 8 on page 4) and tosses a couple of figures in (and points out the possible exaggeration on the part of Josephus): 

There might be more Irish then the few discussed in earlier times in California by this time. No specifics on this man, but there was an earlier proposal for Irish immigrants to help populate California. The Irish had the Catholic faith in common with Mexico, and besides Macnamaras' plan there were Irish soldiers who deserted and fought for Mexico during the Mexican–American War. Irish immigrants were coming to the US in record numbers: 

Again this implies repair were never fully completed before the ship was destroyed in the raid on February 16, 1804. The answer to the second part of the question,when was it 

It has been referred to as the War of 1812 since a very short time after the war: From History of the Hartford Convention:with a review of the policy of the Unites States government which led to the war of 1812 ...By Theodore Dwight, published 1833. 

The purpose of the drawbridge was to deny access to the castle gate. As such, spanning large distances was not usually necessary, at least by the drawbridge itself. The still-operational drawbridges at Helmingham Hall are a good example: 

Note that worldwide discussion of eugenics at the time was mainly focused on sterilization or birth control to eliminate the undesired genetic traits, not euthanasia, which this work seemed to be mainly about. 

We know slaves were allowed within the baths, but the question is could they use the baths as customers. First of all, there doesn't seem to be any writings concerning regulations forbidding the use of the baths by slaves. We do know however that, even among Roman Citizens, access to the baths was regulated. The baths charged an entry fee. 

So don't try too hard to glean historical information from a painting done 825 years after-the-fact. 

So wages for German workers in this era could be expected to typically fall between 18 and 28 Marks per week. 

Several discussions (here, and here) of the changeover from concrete-based structures to stone or brick based raise a couple of possible reasons: 

So I doubt any systemic extermination of wounded soldiers would have been allowed, since, as shown above, even bed-ridden prisoners were expected to work for the war effort. Some discussion here as well. 

Concerning Archelaus, we have what Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War said to go on when discussing the invasion of Macedonia from Thrace to the north (emphasis mine): 

(emphasis mine)The full text of the above can be read here. I am still looking for reliable sources on the number actually deported, but it may have been around 7,000. A court of appeals validated the order in December, 1980. From the Washington Post: 

So it appears the amount was $800,000. Transported in 160 kegs,each containing 5000 Mexican Silver Dollars. It is not readily apparent what the last paragraph of the first letter is concerning, but may have been a correction of some sort. 

Dead Camel Mountains. A very similar story related to these same US Army camels can be found associated with these mountains found in Nevada. From a rock hounding site, RareRocksAndGems.com: 

The National WWII Museum article "American Soldiers Arrive in Great Britain, January 26, 1942" closes with the following information: 

It appears that that geographic isolation was a fairly effective barrier, and I find little mention of foreigners living in the New Mexico region. A couple that are mentioned are noted in The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft: History of Arizona and New Mexico. 1889 

Though the denim jacket was first made in the late, 1800's, the phrase 'Canadian Tuxedo' actually has its source from the 1950s, when an incident occurred at a Canadian Hotel: 

One more source Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook, by Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland, mentions these slave-hunters by name, fugitivarius, also lists them as a 'professional' group, being hired to retrieve the slaves, and specifically states there was no government organization to help in this recovery: 

So they got a resource they needed, trading it for value-added items, and threatened no domestic industry. 

I think we may be operating from a misconception, that the diary entry concerning that the 'target will be a purely military one' and that the statement that 'Hiroshima, a military base' imply Truman did not understand the presence of a city. The target selection process had been going on for some time. A lot of documents are available and the discussion on narrowing down the city to be bombed can be read National Security Archive-George Washington University. This defines Hiroshima ." 

-update- After some further information added in the question, the red triangle is listed at this blog site as being applied to "dissenting Christian priests". So no special color was awarded to them, as mentioned in comments,it appears they were classified as general political prisoners along with: 

So, when tobacco became available, it would have had no competition from the limited use of cannabis in comparison. --Update: Concerning the history of Tobacco Use. I found an excellent discussion of The Antiquities of Tobacco from Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review, Volume 7, published in 1859! The discussion lists first occurrences of tobacco use in Spain, Europe and England, and speaks of people being so surprised by smoke coming from people that 

The above was published April 8, 1921 in an interview labeled "Prof. Einstein--The Poet in Science" So, unless someone finds an actual, published quotation, my conclusion would be that these quotes are all modern paraphrasing of things Einstein did, at various times state. They just aren't his words. 

A little googling leads to the Battle of the Belly River entry. At the end of the discussion on this battle it states: 

Yes. In California Through Russian Eyes, 1806–1848, on page 158, there is a discussion of a celebration being held in honor of the Tsar's birthday. Entertainment in the form of dancing and singing caused mention of two young girls 'sweet voices'. One of the girls who 'distinguished herself' is listed as Dona Josefa de Sola. The footnote credits her as 'The daughter of Governor Pablo Vincente de Sola'. That is the only indication of family (besides his brother) that I find. Since he died in Mexico City in 1826, perhaps records might be found there, such as a will or burial site near other kin. 

An article entitled The Forgotten Faschinenmesser shows a similar weapon (I have cropped original to show similar hilt): 

The source article the Wikipedia entry quotes can be read here: The Spanish Mariners: From the Discovery of America to Trafalgar. 1492-1805. Observations and Reflectionsby Paul V. Murray. This article agrees concerning the Dutch attempts: 

There is also an image/ chart on the site. It is also shown on the Nazi concentration camp badge, which has quite a bit of other info concerning these markings.
