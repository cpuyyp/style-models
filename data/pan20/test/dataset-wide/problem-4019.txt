A question of of Nadirashvili. Let $u$ be a harmonic function in $R^3$, and consider the set $\{ x:u(x)=0\}$. Can this set have finite area? To the best of my knowledge, for $n>2$, local topological classification of zero sets is not known. Not speaking of the global classification, even for harmonic polynomials. If harmonic functions in subregions of $R^n$ are permitted, there are any more problems, for example on the zero sets of gradients of potentials of discrete masses.

It is possible to solve it explicitly in terms of the Airy function. Airy's equation in the standard form is $$y''=xy.$$ Your equation is reduced to this by $x\mapsto-x$ followed by a shift of the independent variable. Airy functions have been thoroughly studied and almost everything you want to know about them is known. In particular there is a full asymptotic expansion for them as $x\to\infty$. Your question is about the behavior of Airy function as $x\to-\infty$. It oscillates, has infinitely may zeros, and the shape of this oscillation is very well described in the special function handbooks. Airy function can be obtained from a hypergeometric one by a confluence process. Type "Airy functions" on Google. 

Let me consider first a slightly different equation $|g(a)-g(b)|=f(|a-b|).$ There is no continuously differentiable function $g$ like this, except $g(x)=kx+c$. Proof. Let $a=x$, $b=x+1$. Then we gave $g(x+1)-g(x)=\pm k,$ where $k=f(1)$, and this is for every $x$. As $g$ is continuous there must be one sign for all $x$, for example $g(x+1)-g(x)=k$. Differentiating we conclude that $g^{\prime}$ has period $1$. Repeating the same argument with $\sqrt{2}$ instead of $1$, we conclude that $g^{\prime}$ has period $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $g^{\prime}$ must be constant. The same argument applies to your equation if you assume that the sets $f^{-1}(c)$ do not contain intervals. Now, for the problem to make sense, $f$ must be surjective. Therefore, for all $c$, except countably many, $f^{-1}(c)$ cannot contain an interval. Co you can find two non-commensurable values $c'$ and $c"$ whose $f$-preimages do not contain intervals. Then the previous argument shows that every $C^1$ solution $g$ must be affine. Your second equation is the same as the first one if you replace $f$ by $f_1(x)=\sqrt{f(x^2)}$. On the other hand, if you put no restrictions on $g$ whatsoever, one can construct crazy examples using axiom of choice. 

My standard reference for elementary geometry is the book M. Berger, Geometry. In section 18.1.4 he defines ``stereographic projection'' in any dimension. Of course it was originally introduced for 2-dimensional sphere, and the name comes from this original use. But nowadays this term is used in any dimension, and I do not see why dimension 1 must be an exception. For the inverse map, Berger has no name, just calls it the inverse stereographic projection. 

This is a very broad and classical subject, depending on the class of functions that you consider. For example, you can consider germs of analytic functions at $0$, such that $f(0)=0$. If $|f'(0)|\neq 0,1$ then all fractional iterates exist, (as analytic germs), and are unique. Moreover $n$ can be any complex number, not necessarily an integer. If $f'(0)=0$, there is an evident obstacle. The case $|f'|=1$ is very complicated, especially when $f'(0)$ is not a root of unity. The literature on the subject is really enormous. Here are just a few important works: Baker, I. N. Permutable power series and regular iteration. J. Austral. Math. Soc. 2 1961/1962 265–294. Écalle, J. Théorie itérative: introduction à la théorie des invariants holomorphes. (French) J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 54 (1975), 183–258. Voronin, S. M. Analytic classification of germs of conformal mappings (C,0)→(C,0). (Russian) Funktsional. Anal. i Prilozhen. 15 (1981), no. 1, 1–17, 96. If we are talking only about analytic germs, then the question has been completely solved only for the germs $f(z)=\lambda z+z^2$, the answer in terms of $\lambda$ is quite complicated. (J-C. Yoccoz was awarded a Fields medal for this.) 

Here is a proof of connectivity for an annulus, but it generalizes to any domain of finite connectivity. WLOG, $D$ is an annulus $a<|z|<1$. Let $f:D\to P^1$ be the embedding. First we approximate it by an embedding which sends the boundary to quasicircles. For this we first restrict $f$ on $D'=\{ z: r_1<|z|<r_2\}$, where $a<r_1<r_2<1$. Let $\phi$ be a quasiconformal map $D\to D'$. Then there exists a quasiconformal map $\psi:P^1\to P^1$ such that $g=\psi\circ f\circ\phi$ is conformal on $D$. If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are close to $a$ and $1$, then $\phi$ can be chosen uniformly close to the identity, and $\psi$ can be chosen uniformly close to the identity. On the second stage, we extend $g$ to the homeomorphism of the Riemann shpere which is quasiconformal on $|z|<a$ and $|z|>1$. This is possible to do because the images of these circles are quasicircles. Let $\mu$ be the Beltrami coefficient of $g$. Then we can deform $g$ to identity by constructing a family of normalized quasiconformal homeomorphisms $g_t$ with Beltrami coefficients $\mu_t=t\mu$, where $0\leq t\leq 1.$ This gives a deformation of your homeomorphism to the identity. Reference on quasiconformal maps, quasicircles and Beltrami equation: L. Ahlfors, Lectures on quasiconformal mappings. 

You are not expected to check the proofs. You are expected to write an informative text which will reflect the contents of the paper. So that the reader can get an idea what did the author prove (or claims to prove), and decide whether s/he wants to read the paper. Of course, if you find a mistake you mention this. Or if you know that the result is not new. But you are not supposed to check the proof: it is the job of the referee. 

What does this procedure have to do with Newton? Just curious. If you approximate with "polygonal" (=piecewise linear) functions in the most natural way, that is take points $(x_k,f(x_k))$ and connect them with straight line segments, what you obtain is the "trapezoid rule" for approximate evaluation of integrals. Of course, the trapezoid rule is "a theorem of Adam"; already Gauss knew much more sophisticated rules. Convergence of the procedure with any continuous function and any (reasonable) choice of $x_k$ is a trivial exercise for modern students, and it was probably in 1905. I looked at the paper, and it seems to me that in it, Lebesgue only proposes a simple way to TEACH the integral. There is nothing really new in this paper. 

Why should it be unique? Let us use complex numbers. Let the equation of the curve be $$F(z,\overline{z})=\sum_{i,j}a_{i,j}z^i\overline{z}^j=0.$$ Inversion (with respect to the unit circle) as defined in the reference you give is $z\mapsto 1/\overline{z}$. We obtain the image curve $$\sum_{i,j}a_{i,j}\overline{z}^{a-i}z^{b-j}=0.$$ where $a$ and $b$ are degrees of $F$ with respect to the first and second variable, So the condition is $a_{i,j}=\overline{a_{a-i,b-j}}.$ Remark. According to the definition in your reference, inversion is defined with respect to a circle, not with respect to a point. 

In addition to the two papers mentioned by Malik Younsi and Lasse Rempe Gillen, there are these two papers: 

Yes, it is true. If the zero set has Hausdorff dimension $<n-1$ then almost every line in the direction of a coordinate axis will not intersect the set. This easily follows from the definition of the Hausdorff dimension. Then you connect your $x$ and $y$ by a piecevise linear curve which does not intersect the zero-set. 

Perhaps it is too late (more than few days passed since the questions were asked) but I will try to clarify what happens in the non-compact case. Let us restrict ourselves to the fllowing special case: suppose that we have a meromorphic function which has at most one critical or asymptotic value on each of the four quadrants, and no other critical or asymptotic values. In other words, there is a 4 point set $A=(a_j)$ one point in each quadrant and such that $$f:S\backslash f^{-1}(A)\to S\backslash A$$ is a covering. For such functions preimages of the cross can be completely characterized: they are cell decompositions of the plane, each vertex has degree 4. There can be "infinite faces" which have infinitely many vertices on the boundary, but the number of vertices on every compact is finite. Theorem. To each such cell decomposition corresponds a meromorphic function f either in the unit disc or on the plane. The free parameters are the 4 ponints $a_j$, plus 2 normalization parameters ($f$ and $f(az+b)$ will have equivalent cell decompositions). The proof of this theorem is an easy application of the Uniformization theorem. Now the difficult problem arises: how to tell whether this is a disc or the plane from the decomposition. This is called the Type Problem of a simply connected Riemann surface. There was a lot of research on this problem in 1950-s. Of more recent works I mention Peter Doyle, On deciding whether a surface is parabolic or hyperbolic, where a probabilistic interpretation hinted in Thurston's last comment is established. And also a paper of Merenkov and Schramm who disprove a conjecture of Nevanlinna that the type depends on the growth rate of concentric balls :-) Of course there is nothing special with taking preimage of a cross from the beginning. One can start with any cell decomposition of the Riemann sphere, such that $f$ has one critical or asymptotic value in each face. The equivalence class of the preimage cell decomposition, together with the critical and asymptotic values themselves and two normalization constants define your function uniquely. But it is hard to tell whether it is meromorphic in the disc or in the plane, except for some special cases. 

My experience shows that a graduate student on an early stage of his career is usually unable to make a reasonable judgement about areas of mathematics etc. on his own. At this stage, the crucial thing is choosing the ADVISER (among those available). The adviser must be a mathematician a) of high standing/reputation and b) the one you feel comfortable to work with. Choose the best one of those available. After you choose such an adviser, and s/he agrees to supervise you, rely completely on his/her advises instead of asking your fellow students and/or MO. I mean you should talk to professors in YOUR department, not to MO. I mean people on MO can recommend you a an area of research, but you will be unlikely to achieve something without a good adviser in this area. 

Andrei Gabrielov. If you compare the list of his works on Google Scholar with the list on Mathscinet, you see that he made almost equally important contributions to pure mathematics and Geology. Alan Sokal. A famous mathematician and physicist. But most famous for his criticism of modern philosophers:-) 

There is a paper related to your question: MR2072747 Ostrovskii, I. V.; Ulanovskii, A. Non-oscillating Paley-Wiener functions. J. Anal. Math. 92 (2004), 211–232. The Paley-Wiener theorem completely describes the Fourier transforms of functions with bounded support. Because of the importance of these functions in signal processing, and other applications, there is an enormous literature about them. On your second question. The answer is no. Take a constant function for example. However, if you require that all Fourier coefficients are zero on $(-M,M)$, one can say something on the sign changes, the most comprehensive account of this phenomenon which I know is MR2038065, and a short exposition is MR2048457. These papers are also avilable from the arxiv and from my web page. 

Take $g_1(x)=x\log^2x$. Properties 1,2 are evidently satisfied, and computation of the second derivative shows that it is negative for $0< x<1/e$. Now rescale: $g(x)=g_1(x/e)$. 

This is determined by informal consensus of researchers in an area. Anyone can propose a name for a mathematical object, just by using this name in a paper. Then the proposed name either sticks to the object or not. This depends on the opinions of other people working in the area. Eventually the name of the object becomes established. Sometimes several names for the same object become established, and all of them popular. For example Fatou set is the same as the set of normality. The name Fatou set was proposed in two influential surveys in 1980s, and many people in the area use it. The name does not have to be the name of the discoverer of the object. For example, Drinfeld introduced an object which he named Yangian, in honor of Chen-Ning Yang. M. Lyubich and I gave the name "Baker's domain" to an object that we defined. Unlike some other "personal names" we proposed in the same paper, this one is used by everyone who writes on the subject. Arnold once stated a principle that "If the thing is named after someone, this indicates that the person had nothing to do with the thing". M. Berry remarked that "Arnold Principle applies to itself". Sometimes a multitude of names reflects a priority dispute or nationalistic feelings (Young diagram vs Ferrers diagram, Schwarz inequality vs Cauchy or Bouniakowski etc.) The name Casorati–Sokhotski–Weierstrass theorem reflects some priority research, but the theorem in question was earlier stated by Briot and Bouquet. Same happened with "Gauss-Manin connection" which was discovered by Legendre. Sometimes the accepted name is changed ($\pi$ used to be "Archimedes number" and $e$ used to be "Euler's number"). A funny story happened with "Koebe constant". It turned out that it is equal to $1/4$, so one mathematician wrote "Now it cannot be called Koebe constant anymore, because it turns out that it already has a name, namely $1/4$"). Sometimes a name is based on a mistake. For example Abel's equation is the accepted name for $f(x+1)=g(f(x))$. It is based on a manuscript of Abel, but the manuscript itself turns out to be just Abel's personal notes on the work of Napier, where the equation was introduced. People usually do not give their own names to mathematical objects. However, in his influential book on functional analysis, Banach introduces "spaces of type H", "spaces of type F" and "spaces of type "B". As his "spaces of type H and F" are nothing but Hilbert and Frechet spaces, people probably understood the hint:-) G. Julia intensively lobbied (not publicly, in private correspondence, which is now published) that the "irregular set" be called Julia set. He succeeded. 

It seems that there is no criterion (an algorithm which will always give an answer). Consider the following simplified problem: is there a criterion that $z^2+c$ has an attracting fixed point in $C$? The set of such $c$ is a union of disjoint open regions. Each region is bounded by an algebraic curve, but the number of regions is infinite. Thus the set is not semi-algebraic, and there can be no "criterion". So the situation is the following: if your computer finds an attracting point, then you are done. If not, you cannot make any conclusion. But if the word "criterion" means only a sufficient condition for absence of attracting points then such criteria exist. In doing computation, one only has to look at the trajectories of the critical points. So if all critical points eventually are absorbed by repelling cycles, then there are no attracting fixed points, and $J=C$. This is a nice, verifiable condition which is most frequently used in showing that for some specific function $J=C$. 

First of all in the statement of what you want to show, there is probably a mistake: you want $\forall\epsilon<1$ in the beginning. Anyway, this is true and this is a stronger statement. Sketch of the proof. What you want to prove is that $g_n$ is injective in $|z|<r$, for a fixed $r$. You have that $g_n(z)=z+h_n(z)$ where $h_n$ is small, together with all derivatives. Write $$|g_n(z_1)-g_n(z_2)|\geq |z_1-z_2|-|h_n(z_1)-h_n(z_2)|.$$ But $h_n$ has small derivative in $|z|<r$, say less than $\delta<1$. So the RHS is greater than $|z_1-z_2|(1-\delta)\neq 0$. This proves your statement. 

There are too many results to survey them here. The principal books addressing this question are: B. Levin, Distribution of zeros of of entire functions, A. Gelfond, Calculus of finite differences, J. M. Whittaker, Interpolatory function theory. All these books exist in multiple editions, and can be found on Internet. But the general form of the results is as you wrote: under certain restrictions on the nodes and values, Lagrange polynomials (or Lagrange series) converge, without any restrictions it diverges.
