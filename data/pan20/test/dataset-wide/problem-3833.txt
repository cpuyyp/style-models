It is a slick, and seemingly ad-hoc, technique often used to prove that a Diophantine equation has no solutions. The equation $f(x_1,\ldots, x_k)=0$, with variables $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some elementary function $f$, is taken modulo some ingeniously chosen $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Then by evaluating $f$ on the $k^n$ possible $k$-tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ of residues modulo $n$, it is shown that $0$ is achieved in no case. Thus no solution exists in $\mathbb{Z}$ either. A traditional classroom example is $x^2+y^2-3z^2=0$. Assume $\gcd(x,y)=1$ without loss of generality, and use modulo $3$. The trouble is in coming up with the brilliant $n$. An example of a good heuristic principle is choosing modulo $20$ if there are powers of $4$ as, out of to $20$ possible residues, the only quartic residues are $0,1,5,16$. Are there similar mods for other powers? In general, has there been any work done on an objective way of finding $n$? Perhaps good heuristics, if nothing else? Restrict $f$ to some non-trivial case, say certain polynomials of given degree, if needed. Paper references would be nice. 

Let ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be a $n$-variable polynomial ring over a complex number field ${\Bbb C}$. For its maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$, we define the geometric regular local ring as $R \colon= {\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_{(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}$, which is the localisation of ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ at $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. $R$ has the unique maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. We shall consider the polynomial ring $R[X]$ over $R$ and choose $m$ Weierstrass polynomials \begin{align} & f_1(X) = c_{1,0} + c_{1,1}X + \ldots + c_{1,e_1}X^{e_1} \\ & {\phantom{AAA}} ... \\ & f_m(X) = c_{m,0} + c_{m,1}X + \ldots + c_{m,e_{m}}X^{e_m}, \end{align} where $c_{1,0},\ldots,c_{i,j},\ldots,c_{m,e_m} \in (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. Suppose that ${\mathrm{GCD}}(f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X)) = 1$. Now for a function $F(X) \in R[X]$, we consider the following condition$\colon$ $(\sharp)$ $\quad F(\alpha) \in (f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))\phantom{A}$ for any $\alpha \in {\Bbb C}$, where $(f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))$ is the ideal of $R$. Q. Does $F(X) \in (f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X))$? 

Theorem: In this paper of Frei and Levesque, they correct the proof of a result of Halter-Koch and Stender: Define the real pure algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}(\omega_n)$ for $\omega_n=\sqrt[n]{D^n\pm d}>0$ (the $\pm$ sign is fixed), where $d,D,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $d|D^n$ and $D^n\pm d$ is not a $k^{\text{th}}$-power positive integer for $k|n$. Let $\epsilon_{n,k}=\frac{(\omega_n-D)^k}{\omega_n^k-D^k}$. Then the set $\{\epsilon_{n,k}: k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}, k|n\}$ is an independent system of units in $\mathbb{K}$. Background: I am looking specifically at computing units of algebraic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ for odd primes $p$ (any infinite family in $t\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, with $p$ fixed). Unfortunately, the above result gives only one unit $\frac{(\omega_p-D)^p}{\omega_p^p-D^p}$. Question: Are there results on obtaining at least one other independent (non-torsion) unit? Note: For irreducible $x^p-t$ there is one real root $\sqrt[p]{t}$ and $p-1$ non-real complex roots $\zeta_p^i \sqrt[p]{t}$ for $i=1,\ldots,p-1$ and $\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}}$. Then by Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the unit rank of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ is $1+\frac{p-1}{2}-1=\frac{p-1}{2}$. Thus I am especially interested in $p=5$ where there can be at most two independent units. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$. 

Theorem. The Galois group of a quintic polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $A_5$ if and only if its discriminant is a rational square and its Weber sextic resolvent has no rational root. Question. What are known infinite families of of quintic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, each with Galois group $A_5$? I am aware of two explicit such families as follows. Example 1. $f(x)=x^5+(5t^2-1)(5x+4)$ for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $t\equiv\pm 1\pmod{21}$. This is Exercise 3.7.2 in the book Generic Polynomials by Jensen, Ledet and Yui. Example 2. $f(x)=x^5+(t^2-5^5)(x-4)$ for non-zero $t\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall u\in\mathbb{Q}: t\ne g(u)$ where $g(u)=\frac{(u^3-18u^2+8u-16)(u^3+2u^2+18u+4)}{2u^2(u^2+4)}$. This is from the paper Reducibility and the Galois group of a parametric family of quintic polynomials by Lavallee, Spearman and Williams. Note. Both are all trinomials, presumably because it is easier to construct polynomials with square discriminant when some coefficients vanish. It would be nice to see otherwise. 

We shall suppose that for any couple $m, n$ with $m > n$, ${\frak a}_m \mapsto {\frak a}_n, f_m \mapsto f_n$, respectively by the natural quotient surjection $A_m \twoheadrightarrow A_n$, i.e., eliminating variables $X_{n+1},...,X_m$ in $A_m$. Now, I should like to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture: Suppose that $m \gg n$ and $k(m) \gg k(n)$. Then the following inequality holds$\colon$ $l(m) > l(n)$. 

Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be integral schemes of finite type over a field $K$ (i.e., locally affine opens are finitely-generated algebras over $K$). Suppose we have the following condition$\colon$ $f \colon Y \to X$ is finite. We consider a dominant morphism $g \colon Z \to X$. Q. Suppose that ${\cal O}_Y \cap {\cal O}_Z = {\cal O}_X$. Then is it possble that $Y \times_X Z$ is not integral while $Y \times_X \eta_Z$ being integral ? As in the answer below in the case $Y = Z$, there is an example as $Y$ being a normalisation of $X$. 

Given the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the standard inner (dot) product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, the problem of almost-orthogonal sets asks, for each $\epsilon> 0$, for the construction (or at the very least, bounds on the cardinality) of a maximal subset $S$ of $U_n$, the set of unit vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\forall x,y\in S: x\ne y\implies |\langle x,y\rangle|\le\epsilon$. For known results, see Matt Cheung's Major Qualifying Project monograph at this link. Question: What are known results, if we restrict ourselves to some subset of $U_n$? Specifically, I am interested in the subset $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ consisting of the vertices of the scaled-down unit cube inscribed inside the unit ball centered at $0$. 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D. 

Definition. An $m\times n$ matrix is said to be a partial Hadamard matrix (let's say PHM) if its entries are chosen from $\lbrace -1, 1 \rbrace$ such that the dot product of each pair of row vectors is $0$. Details. This of course relates to the famous Hadamard conjecture which looks at $m=n$, but I am interested in the weaker $m<n$ case. Specifically, I am wondering about how many distinct $m\times n$ PHM exist given some, say $2$, of the row vectors, up to row permutation - as well as their construction. Questions. What are some good resources on results known about PHM? Are there iconic papers in the field? 

I shall only propose an outline of the possible proof below, where Claim 1, Claim 2 and Claim 3 have not yet been proved rigorously. We shall begin the outline. So suppose that every element of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every parameter of $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation. Then, we consider the specialisation defined as follows$\colon$ $$(\lozenge) \quad X_i = S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m) \in K[[X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]].$$ Some sort of Bertini argument, i.e. Bertini irreducibility theorem for the hyperplane section, might justify the following Claim 1$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\, 1.}$ After the specialisation, by which I mean simply to insert $(\lozenge)$ into the irreducible polynomial $f$ at ${Q}\,2$ in the above, the specialised polynomial $s(f) \in K[[X_2,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]][X_1]$ remains still irreducible as long as $S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m)$ is sufficiently general. Moreover, conditions in the question remains unchanged with only the number of variables dropped by one. Thus we can use the induction on $m$ when $m \geq 4$. That is, the ideal $I_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,X_m]]$ turns into another ideal $K_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]]$ after specialisation. Besides, the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by the constant $C$ due to the induction hypothesis. Finally, we propose the following result$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,2.}$ There exists at least one general specialisation $(\lozenge)$ such that both numbers of generators of ideals $I_1$ and $K_1$ coincide with each other as long as $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ (i.e., $I_1$ does not contain every parameter $X_3,\ldots,X_m$). The assumption of $Q\,2$ ensures that actually $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ holds, for otherwise $J_1$ might not be monomial. Now, we proceed as follows. Since the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by $C$, Claim 2 ensures that the number of generators of $I_1$ is also bounded by $C$ as desired as long as $m \geq 4$. So eventually, the induction argument obliges us only to show the following claim$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,3.}$ $Q\,1$ is correct. Wishfully, this outline should be justified rigorously at least in the case where every element $\alpha_i$ of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation, i.e. $\alpha_i = \underset{e_2,\ldots,e_m}{\Sigma} c_{e_2\ldots,e_m \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}}\,X_2^{e_2} \cdots X_m^{e_m}$.
