Whey comes from milk. It's part of the byproducts of processing milk and is one of the components made into cheese. The reason I point this out is that some people are allergic to milk. While the whey protein powder processing usually removes the disagreeable parts for those who are lactose intolerant, it is still whey. If dairy in general (cheese, milk, etc.) causes nasal allergies, then there is no reason why whey protein which comes from milk will not cause the same thing. In short, it comes down to your own allergies. If you have no allergies, then you can expect no detrimental affects. If you do have allergies, then you can expect those allergies to behave the same way they always do. 

In the mean time, I would forgo pressing of any kind (bench and overhead) at the moment. If the pain doesn't subside after 4-5 days, see a doctor and follow their rehab advice. Otherwise, once the pain subsides, I recommend performing the Diesel Shoulder Rehab protocol. After the rehab protocol, take some weight off the bar and build back up (perhaps down to 105). Focus on the following: 

Is < insert diet choice here > better for XYZ? No. And not so much because I like meat or carbs or bread or whatever the diet says you can't have. All the studies I've seen come up with one basic fact about diet: 

It appears that Musclecore X uses certain BCAAs, namely arganine to "boost NO2" in the blood. There's a few supplements that use the claim that increase in nitrous oxide (NO2) helps build muscle. It is also important to note that arganine is readily available in a number of common foods. There is a semi-scientific study on Bodybuilding.com using a different product with similar claims. The pertinent information is quoted below (emphasis is mine): 

After your bouldering exercises, I recommend a cool-down period. In this cool-down you'll do the stretching you need to improve your range of motion, but don't over-stretch (meaning don't push past the pain). The very next day when you can barely move, try to get your blood flowing with a simple warmup. You'll probably have to go slowly, but it is worth it. Then foam roll and do more stretching. In essence you can stretch daily, and the more you limber up, and foam roll the soft tissues, the better you will feel and the quicker you will recover. If your bouldering activities are all on the weekend, you should have a couple days for building core strength in between during the week. Even if you don't have access to barbells, kettle bells, or anything like that, good body weight exercises will help you improve your core strength. 

I think you'll find that you want to use the heaviest weight you can for your target TUT. You'll also find that different timings will address problems. For example, pause bench and pause squats help build power from the bottom of the lift. You don't need a long pause, simply long enough to stop the bar motion. There is an inverse relationship between the time under tension and the max weight you will be able to lift like that. If you are intentionally going slow, adjust the weight down. If your bar speed is simply a result of how well you can control the bar at that weight, you can work on increasing the speed of the bar. The biggest take away from both of these articles is to not get overworked on one tempo. Varying the tempo helps you focus on the eccentric part of the lift, or the concentric part of the lift. If you find the bar path is erratic on that phase of the lift slow it down until you can control the bar properly. Then work on speeding it back up with higher weight. A possible approach would be to go fast on weight increases, then slow down at the new weight. There is no one best. Just play with the timing to address your current needs. 

Those are just templates that have worked for a large number of people. If you find they aren't for you, then there are lots more out there to choose from. 

There's more than one type of muscle mass, and training different rep ranges emphasize one over the other: 

The bottom line is that there is no lift that can adequately replace squats. Lunges are acceptable, but if you are worried about knee health the idea of touching the knee to the floor with weights is not really appealing. Goblet squats are a good way to get introduced to the movement, get some torso strength, and more easily get to depth. Running, partial squats, jumps, etc. are all exercises that place much higher stresses on the knee joint. One of the main factors is the fact that only the anterior muscles are engaged when you land. The force imparted to the knee as your weight is coming down and your foot is already on the immovable earth is up to 3x your body weight. The impact is much faster than it would be to get the posterior chain involved--thus no help. Squats protect your knee, and help improve your posterior chain use even in these high stress activities. As long as all the forces come from one side of your body (anterior chain or posterior chain), there is an increased risk of injury. When both sides of your body are engaged, the load is distributed to the muscle rather than the joints. 

When you do any type of resistance training (machines, free weights [barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells], body-weight exercise) you have to approach your programming in these ways: 

Two things that help with rock climbing are core strength and grip. Two of the biggest things gained with deadlifts are core strength and grip. They are a match made in heaven. In fact, getting better at one will help you get better at the other. I understand your concern with deadlifts, I used to have a bad back myself. The key to deadlifts is to keep your lower lumbar region rigid. Do not round your back at all. Also, it is worth trying both sumo and conventional deadlifts. You'll find yourself feeling stronger with one or the other. Whichever one is stronger, use that every time you deadlift. Whichever you choose, the principles are the same:
