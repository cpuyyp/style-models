Clearly the output then describes a Turing machine that is identical (up to isomorphism) to the Turing machine that created it. (Technically I should say that the output is a string and not a code, and that some other Turing machine (possibly the one that created it) wants to simulate it as a subroutine, say, for iterating, and can then pick up that string, strip the quotes (which then makes it code), and then execute.) Such a Turing machine may be construed as a fixed point with respect to an implementation function: $I(C+\text{str}(C))=C+\text{str}(C).$ And also note there is no circular problem here; we simply write the code twice, but put quotes around it the second time (and assign it to some variable). So it's not like $\text{str}(C)$ has some infinite length to it or anything (at least not literally, but semantically it will). Now you may notice this form $C+\text{str}(C)$ is eerily similar to the form of a successor set in set theory: $s(x)=x\cup\{x\}.$ If we abandoned the Axiom of Regularity and considered a cyclic set (containing itself) of the form $A=\{\text{elements of }A,A\},$ then it is readily seen to be a fixed point for the successor function $s.$ In particular, the set $N:=\{N,0,1,2,...\}$ would also satisfy the Axiom of Infinity (in addition to the ordinal $\omega$) but would also be a successor fixed point (whereas $\omega\neq\omega+1$ is not a fixed point). Of course, ZFC$^-$ (ZFC minus Regularity) cannot prove the existence of cyclic sets (without being inconsistent), but they are consistent relative to ZFC$^-$. The universe though should also be closed under the power set and union operations. Indeed if $V=\{V,\textsf{all other sets}\}$ (so that, in effect, a "set of all sets" could be discussed) then it would be closed under successor, power set, and union operations (as it would have anyway with Regularity). But it now also self-referentially resolves the paradox of needing set theory to generate set theory: set theory becomes precisely the thing needed to describe itself. In particular, if I think of a choice function on $V$ as something analogous to a Turing machine choosing a subroutine to implement, then $c(V)=V$ becomes analogous to a Turing machine simulating itself as a subroutine (or, say, set theory being used to rigorously construct set theory---after which point we call the first one a ``meta'' one, simply to distinguish the two identical copies). In this interpretation, one can "step outside the system" without having to step outside the system, which is a win-win. 

I have looked at "small" examples and I can see how the point-count of the image of a map modulo $v$ varies with the splitting behavior of the prime $v$ as described above. I am not uncomfortable with the statement, in that it makes sense with my understanding of the "yoga" of varieties over a number field. Sadly, neither of these translate into an understanding of how one would prove such a fact. Insights into this, as well as corrections to any of my misunderstandings of the situation that I make clear in this exposition, are all welcome. Ultimately, I am interested in what other choices I can make for $K$ other than "number field". 

Since you are so early in your career, in my opinion you are much better off leaving the paper where it is and hopefully it will be published soon. It's possible that you could have initially aimed higher, but because the refereeing process can sometimes take 6 months or even a year, you definitely don't want to withdraw it now- it could delay acceptance and publication by a long time. Even if you get a favourable referee's report, there's no guarantee that resubmitting it to a better journal will result in a favourable report. At your stage, it's better to get papers accepted and published, even if they're at lower-rank journals, than to be waiting over a year for a decision by a better journal. 

Coefficients of cyclotomic polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$. If you look at the factorization of $X^n-1$ over the integers, for $2 \leq n \leq 104$, you would "notice" that all nonzero coefficients of all factors are $\pm 1$. Indeed, $105$ is the first counterexample to this conjecture, with the 105th cyclotomic polynomial having coefficients of $2$ in its expansion. This can happen because $105$ has three distinct odd prime factor. The conjecture and the counterexample, however, are accessible even to high school students. A quick Internet search suggests the following book as a reference: McClellan, J. H. and Rader, C. Number Theory in Digital Signal Processing. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979. I admit I have not read it - I first saw the counterexample while teaching high school, and it came up again in an advanced undergraduate course on Galois theory. 

JosÃ© is correct, with the caveat that Gunnar mentioned - you need simple-connectedness to know that reduced holonomy = holonomy. Below I expand a bit more on the details. [Thanks to Tim Perutz for catching errors in the initial version of this answer.] Notice that the OP did not ask for $\Omega$ to be parallel or even closed. The following is true: If $(M, J, g, \omega)$ is Ricci-flat Kaehler, then the image of the first Chern class $c_1 (M)$in $H^2 (M, \mathbb R)$ vanishes, so that if $\pi_1(M) = 0$, then $H^2(M, \mathbb Z)$ has no torsion, and thus the canonical bundle $\Lambda^{n, 0} (M)$ is topologically trivial. So there exists a nowhere vanishing smooth $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ that trivializes the canonical bundle. By consideration of type, $\Omega \wedge \overline \Omega$ is a nonvanishing $(n,n)$-form, so by rescaling $\Omega$ by a nowhere vanishing complex valued function, one gets for "free" the identity that $$ \frac{\omega^n}{n!} = (-1)^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \Omega \wedge \overline \Omega.$$ Since $\Omega$ is type $(n,0)$ and the complex structure is integrable, then $\Omega$ will be holomorphic (and thus the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial) if and only if it is closed. Since $M$ is Ricci-flat, the Bochner theorem tells you that an $(n,0)$ form is closed if and only if it is parallel, which would give you holonomy contained in $SU(n)$. Compactness is needed to go the other way: Yau's theorem says that if $M$ is compact Kaehler and $c_1 (M) = 0$, then there exists a unique Ricci flat Kaehler metric in each Kaehler class. There are noncompact examples where uniqueness fails. I don't know as much as I should about the literature on existence in the noncompact case, but the papers of Tian-Yau should have the answer. A good elementary reference is Chapter 6 of Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy by Dominic Joyce. 

Let $Y$ be a (locally compact) non-Hausdorff topological space. I want to know if there is a necessary and/or sufficient condition for $Y=X/G$, that is, $Y$ is the orbit space of a locally compact Hausdorff $G$-space $X$. I'd then indeed be able to call $Y$ an NC Space, with associated C*-algebra $C_0(X)\rtimes G$. I couldn't find this "inverse" question in Connes' NCG or in Williams' Crossed Products of C*-algebras, where I might expect to find it (nor in Bourbaki, although there were similar things), though on pg. 112 Connes does state that when we have this situation (X/G being non-Hausdorff when X is LCH), the appropriate C*-algebra to assign is $C_0(X)\rtimes G$. It seems like a natural question since many examples of nc spaces arise as orbit spaces. 

I would also add the following book: Dominic Joyce, Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy The early parts of the book include an introduction to the Riemannian geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It also includes a proof of the Calabi conjecture. 

I like Cliff Taubes's simple titles: "Gr -> SW", "SW -> Gr", and "SW = Gr". (Okay, they each also have a subtitle, but the first part is enough to tell the reader exactly what the paper is about.) 

Just to follow up on Eric's correct answer: when you have an almost complex structure $J$, you can decompose $1$-forms into type $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Locally, you can find a local basis $e^1, \ldots, e^n$ of $(1,0)$-forms, but these are not of the form $dz^1, \ldots, dz^n$. Indeed, as Eric mentioned, we do not have local holomorphic coordinates. Then $\bar e^1, \ldots, \bar e^n$ are a local basis of $(0,1)$ forms. Now if we compute $de^i$, it is a $2$-form, so it can be written in the form \begin{equation*} de^i = a^i_{jk} e^j \wedge e^k + b^i_{jk} e^j \wedge \bar e^k + c^i_{jk} \bar e^j \wedge \bar e^k. \end{equation*} The almost complex structure $J$ is integrable if and only if all the $c^i_{jk}$'s are zero. 

I am currently reading Serre's "Topics in Galois Theory". Specifically, I am looking at the proof of Theorem 3.6.2, and there is one aspect of the proof that is unclear to me. I'll describe the setting, and state my questions below. The setting is as follows. Let $K$ be a number field, $W$ and $V$ absolutely irreducible varieties of dimension $n$ over $K$, and $\pi: W \to V$ a generically surjective morphism. The map $\pi$ induces an extension of function fields $K(W) / K(V)$. Let $K(W)^{gal}$ be the Galois closure of $K(W)$ in this extension, $W^{gal}$ the normalization of $W$ in $K(W)^{gal}$, and $\pi ' : W^{gal} \to V$ the composition of $\pi$ with the projection from $W^{gal}$ to $W$. Let $v$ be a prime of $K$ that splits completely in the algebraic closure of $K$ in $K(W)^{gal}$. Serre states that "the connected components of the fiber [of $W^{gal}$] at $v$ are absolutely irreducible" (bracketed text mine), and uses this along with the Lang-Weil estimates to compute $\# W^{gal}(\mathbb F _v)$. Questions: 

I might argue that it is indeed a fixed object, but in a different sense. Let me preface by saying that I (am not an expert in set theory, but also) have been saying to others for years something to the effect of: we may be better served by removing the Axiom of Regularity/Foundation from ZFC. In order to explain why, let me first take a small detour into the realm of Turing machines. One remarkable concept that any CS major probably sees (disclaimer: I wasn't one) is that there exist Turing machines that can output their own descriptions. I will skip the details of returning descriptions of inner functions (subroutines) and assert that such a machine should essentially have code of the form $C+\text{str}(C)$ where $+\text{str}(C)$ means add string of the code to the code. The idea here is that the instructions $C$ should include something to the effect of 

I decided to make my comment into a more detailed answer. When $M$ has an almost complex structure $J$, then one can talk about smooth complex-valued differential forms of type $(p,q)$ in the usual way. A complex valued $2$-form $\omega$ is type $(1,1)$ if and only if it satisfies $\omega(JX,JY) = \omega(X,Y)$ for all smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$. If $\omega$ is a real $2$-form of type $(1,1)$, which means that $\overline \omega = \omega$, and if we define $g(X,Y) = \omega(X, JY)$, then it is easy to show that $g$ is a smooth, symmetric bilinear form on $M$. So it is a Riemannian metric if and only if it is positive definite. This is the definition of a positive $(1,1)$-form (that the associated $g$ is positive definite.) The triple of data $(J, \omega, g)$, where $J$ is an almost complex structure, $\omega$ is a real positive $(1,1)$-form, and $g$ is the associated Riemannian metric as defined above together define an almost Hermitian manifold. Now the condition for $M$ to be Kaehler is that $M$ be complex ($J$ is integrable) and that $d\omega = 0$. (These two conditions can be packaged together as $\nabla \omega = 0$ or $\nabla J = 0$, where $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$.) Hence, if one is starting out with a complex manifold $M$, together with a closed real $2$-form, the only additional condition required to ensure that it defines a Kaehler metric is that it be a positive $(1,1)$-form.
