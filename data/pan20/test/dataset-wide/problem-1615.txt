…this would put the total number of active career firefighters at 0.33*1,065,700 = 351,860. Adding this number to the number of law enforcement officers puts law enforcement + firefighters at the same level. I don't think the number of amateur tax preparers can be reasonably defined, let alone accurately measured. In conclusion, depending on what federal agency one sources information to, the number of professional firefighters + law enforcement officers is either the same as the number of professional tax preparers, or it may be slightly smaller. 

This is completely bogus. Although absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, her name has no results on the NASA website (only Mary Ann Esfandiari does; unrelated). Taking another look at the book you mention, it is full of claims that are highly implausible (to put it mildly): 

However, the Garnett paper considers both animal and non-animal agriculture, so these figures cannot be directly compared. However, they go on to state: 

The Wikipedia article on metrication contains an unsourced statement regarding an incident in Ypres (Ieper), Belgium: 

In summary: exact methodologies differ and it can be difficult to compare figures, a literature survey did not show significant disagreement with the FAO study. Do trucks with animals count to animal agriculture? Do trucks with meat do? Studies that I found that disagreed rather considered that the FAO underestimated animal agriculture-induced emissions, than that they overestimated it. So: Yes, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than transportation. 

The question needs to be answered on a case-by-case basis. Certainly, not all GMO food is toxic, and the process of GMO does not inherently lead to toxicity. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that novel gene combinations can never lead to increased toxicity for individual organisms. Below I have collected some sources, either neutral ones, or focussing on the risks. I did not include information from sources with a commercial interest in GMO, such as Monsanto, as I am of the opinion that information from corporate sources deserves to be distrusted. A recent review study According to Domingo et. al. (2011), who did an overview of studies into this question, the number of references concerning human and animal toxicological/health risks studies on GM foods/plants was very limited. 

I consider that these sources are not really authoritative, nor is the Tea Party itself, because they will have an interest in presenting themselves as a grassroots movement whether they are or not. Considering historical evidence, what can we say about the claim? Is the US Tea Party a grassroots or an astroturf movement? 

Yes, he did. A Google Cache version of Chomsky's own website has the text his lecture The State-Corporate Complex: A Threat to Freedom and Survival, given at the The University of Toronto, April 7, 2011 verifies this (emphasis mine): 

Indeed, the range of 40–1000Hz has nothing to do with wifi or cellphones, so this does raise the question what exactly the authors are talking about. 

None of the quotes are really convincing to me. Considering the ludicrosity of the idea of paying more than 100% taxes, I wonder — is this really true? Did anyone in Sweden ever pay more than 100% in income tax? 

The claim is problematic, because there are no sharp definitions or characterisations of either islamic extremist or right-wing extremist. I would consider islamic extremists as a subset of right-wing extremists (surely they're not on the left?!). For the purpose of this question, I interpret the claim to mean right-wing extremists as non-islamic right-wing extremists. There are plenty of mass shootings in the USA that are not typically described as terrorism. Does it become terrorism if someone has praised IS or Hitler on the internet? Does it become terrorism if someone has an IS or Nazi flag at home? Does it become terrorism if IS claims an attack as theirs? Second disclaimer: in my analysis, I lump together very different views under a common label of far-right / right-wing. See also some questions elsewhere on SE such as here and here. The Global Terrorism Database lists 2693 terrorist incidents in the United States between 1970-01-01 and 2015-12-26, attempting objective criteria: 

Between April 2014 and November 2015, there was at least 1 attack by far-right and at least 0 by islamists, with most by unaffiliated individuals. Between 11 and 50 casualties totals only 6 incidents: 

The FAO report is also cited by the IPCC AR WG3 report. A more recent study by Goodland and Anhang (not peer reviewed, but cited by at least 19 Scopus-indexed studies) claims that the FAO study actually underestimates livestock's contribution: 

For the last 5 months of 2015, there was at least 1 incident reportedly by right-wing extremists, and at least 0 by islamist extremists, with most incidents by unaffiliated individuals or unknown perpetrators. However, one needs to dig deeper into the data to address the claim. The database allows to search by specific perpetrator group, but not by perpetrator group category, nor can we sort by the latter. As I'm not going to study 2693 incidents in detail, I'm making it a bit more manageable if we limit it to 241 incidents with 1–10 casualties: 

The study documents in detail Connections between the tobacco industry, third-party allies and the Tea Party. But in an article on Fox News: 

This review was from 2011. United Nations Environmental Programme assessment The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, an international effort co-sponsored by FAO, GEF, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, the World Bank and WHO, issued a lengthy report assessing what the title says. This includes (but is not limited to) issues related to GMO. Several reports, as well as summaries, are linked from the United Stations Environmental Programme IAASTD page. Specifically on the safe to consume for humans issue, they write on page 200 in the global report (emphasis theirs): 

Halving extreme poverty from 1990 to 2015 is the #1 Millenium Development Goal (and the Sustainable development goals aim to eradicate it completely by 2030). Specifically, target 1A for the MDG is: 

P.S. Note that when people say emissions, they often mean net emissions, i.e. total sources minus total sinks. As the two are constantly in flux, total emission as such is not very meaningful (and quite hard to determine). 

So, yes, Piff has published research showing correlations between social class and entitlement. Whether this is a cause-and-effect relationship is a different question. A full list of his publications is available on his website. See also reports on rigged monopoly games. 

Through this blog article on climaterocks.com a study was brought to my attention that claims that the Tea Party is rather astroturf than grassroots: Amanda Fallin, Rachel Grana, and Stanton A Glantz, To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts’: the tobacco industry and the Tea Party. Tobacco Control, doi:10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2012-050815. From the abstract: 

NB: That does not mean there certainly is no difference, but with a study of this scale, I think it is fair to conclude there probably is no (major) difference. 

This claim, apparently originating with the Canadian New Democratic Party, states that under the Harper government, the number of protected lakes and rivers has dropped dramatically: 

In Sweden and other Nordic countries, the presence of beggars on the streets is a relatively new phenomenon, with many beggars originating from new EU member states. There are frequent claims that those beggars are part of organised networks, and that money raised does not stay with the beggars but goes to ring leaders. For example of people claiming this, see Beggars in Stockholm, The Local DK, or the reports from the very same day that the police in Sweden claim that begging is or isn't organised. A recent article asserts that a recent study shows that it is not organised. The news is based on an English language report from the Norwegian FAFO institute (PDF, 136 pages, 3.6 MB), who write that For most, income from begging and street work is shared only within the immediate family and household.. What evidence is there for the assertion that a large part of the revenue raised by beggars in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Oslo, does not benefit the beggars but is taken by third parties? I imagine some might claim that the report from the FAFO institute is not the end of the debate. (NB: For the scope of this question, by organised I mean specifically a situation where money raised by beggars goes to a third party in an exploitative manner. If beggars voluntarily choose to organise themselves in a labour union to demand better condition or whatnot, that is a different matter.) 

Many (western) sources claim that Putin (actively) supports the rebels in eastern Ukraine, more specifically the Donbass People's Militia. For example, BBC News writes: 

Cuba is frequently cited as an example of a country which has great healthcare considering its limited economic resources. For example: 

It appears there are non-reliable sources on the internet claiming broccoli has a nervous system: forum at funnyjunk.com: 

It is difficult to reconcile the two. By objectively measurable indicators, such as access to (preventive) care, health expectancy, infant mortality etc., does Cuban healthcare perform better than the healthcare for countries of comparable economic strength? Or is there verifiable evidence that this is primarily a very well-constructed façade set up by the authorities in Cuba? 

For the sake of completion, they define GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) as An organism in which the genetic material has been altered anthropogenically by means of gene or cell technologies.. Union of Concerned Scientists point of view The Union of Concerned Scientists is a an advocacy organisation, and not necessarily objective. However, I do think their assessments are evidence-based, so I think their point of view is worth quoting: 

However, Susan Crockford is frequently named as collecting evidence for the claim that polar bears are doing well, despite a reduction in sea ice. Crockford is adjunct professor at the University of Victoria, Canada. For example, from her blog, Polar bears have not been harmed by sea ice declines: 

Although focussed on cyclists and not pedestrians, recent research from the University of Skövde concludes: it depends. The research appears to be ongoing. In 2014, they published a study where they researched what subconscious visual cues determine the intent of cyclists in traffic: Hemeren, Paul E., Mikael Johannesson, Mikael Lebram, Fredrik Eriksson, Kristoffer Ekman, and Peter Veto. "The use of visual cues to determine the intent of cyclists in traffic." In Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support (CogSIMA), 2014 IEEE International Inter-Disciplinary Conference on, pp. 47-51. IEEE, 2014.. This appears to be based on a lengthy report in Swedish. Then, they investigated what visual enhancements help motorists to see this. I haven't found a peer-reviewed study for the second part. All I found specifically for the reflectors is press release in Swedish. Some cyclists were wearing no reflectors at all, others were wearing some reflectors, and others were wearing reflectors at body places deemed optimal according to previous research. Their conclusion is that it is very important where on the body the reflectors are worn. From the press release: 

And Kerry claims there is an enormous array of facts that Russia supported rebels, but remains vague. However, when checking the collection Wikipedia has made for the militants' war material, most of it appears to be stolen from military bases, captured, or even taken from museums. Wikipedias sources are incomplete, but the table doesn't list anything that can only have come from Russia. The claim that Putin supports the rebels in eastern Ukraine is a rather strong one with profound political implications, so it deserves to be studied carefully. What publicly available evidence is there for the claim that Russia supports the Donpass People's Militia? Edit: By support, I mean that the national government of Russia provides direct support, in the form of money, training, by sending personnel, or otherwise, to the rebels. I am not skeptical of claims that Russian volunteers are fighting with the rebels. 

According to an assessment by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the herbicide glyphosate (ingredient in Roundup), is probably carcinogenic to humans: 

No, wifi and cellphone radiation have not been shown to increase the risk of miscarriage. A recent peer-reviewed publication suggests a correlation between magnetic field exposure from all sources and miscarriages, but correlation does not imply causation and the frequencies tested are far smaller (40–1000 Hz) than wifi/cellphone EM frequencies (800–2600 MHz). The publication does not suggest any possible physical mechanism to explain the correlation and thus does not establish causation. The paper does not claim the correlation is specifically due to magnetic fields from wifi or cellphones. There are some other weaknesses in the study that are not addressed, such as an explicit discussion of the frequency of the fields. From the testing device used, this appears to be in the 40 Hz–1 Khz range, far below wifi/cellphone radiation and rather in the range of alternating current power. The original publication is: De-Kun Li, Hong Chen, Jeannette R. Ferber, Roxana Odouli & Charles Quesenberry. Exposure to Magnetic Field Non-Ionizing Radiation and the Risk of Miscarriage: A Prospective Cohort Study. In: Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 17541 (2017), doi:10.1038/s41598-017-16623-8. $URL$
