There is the smell of a paradox lurking here. Let us assume that there is some system of rules that codify what is the right thing to do. (I am attempting to formulate things so that this applies equally to the question as restricted to political philosophy as well as to the more general moral philosophy reading of it.) Let us assume further that there are indeed circumstances where the right thing to do would be to violate the rules that the first assumption posits. If the circumstances in which it would be right to violate the rules were able to be sharply delineated, then such a sharp delineation would actually serve as a source of further (implicit) rules. So, while it may well be that there are rules and that it is sometimes right to violate them, the question as put invites a further expansion of the rules to encompass the circumstances under which the violation of the rules would be right. Hence, if the the question is answerable in a sharp sense, it is mis-posed. 

I don't think that there is a single useful non-overlapping set of branches. For instance, philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of logic are, on some views, contained within one another (on some views philosophy of logic is a branch of philosophy of mathematics, on others the containment goes the other way). Both take up issues that are also clearly within Epistemology and Metaphysics. The way I would characterize the branches at the top level is: 

So, on any religious view (such as most denominations of Christianity and some schools of thought in Islam) that rejects the Divine Command Theory, there needs to be some alternative account of what makes the good good. The Natural Law tradition is one such attempt, though both as it still gives God an important role and because of various serious objections, it is not widely accepted outside of Roman Catholicism and is not a serious option for the Humanist. All is not lost, however. Both Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics attempt to provide non-theistic means to ground a notion of good. Utilitarianism proceeds by observing that we do value pleasure and the absence of pain, argues that these are the ultimate ends for which we act, and then argues that the extent to which actions meant the ultimate ends for which we act and which we do value as good is the rational basis for a test of the goodness of actions. Kantian ethics attempts to ground a conception of the good action in terms of rational conduct, arguing that to act on a rule that could not consistently be wished to be a universally accepted rule is to act incoherently and thus wrongly. Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism can be developed in ways consistent with a religious faith and in ways consistent with atheism. There are of course other candidate accounts of morality, too. So, there is no necessary path from "There is no God" to "Everything is permitted." Yes, the questions as to what is right and wrong absent God are hard. But they are exactly as hard as the real question as to why the right is right that the religious person faces unless they adopt the unsatisfactory Divine Command Theory of morality. 

No given dictionary for a language completely describes that language. One of the elements of a language is its lexicon: the collection of words that are composed to make up strings of that language. Dictionaries are always behind the lexicon as it changes more quickly than lexicographers can keep up with. Even if we change the question to ask about the lexicon (together with the meanings of the lexical elements), that will not determine a language. There is also the grammar of the language: the rules by which lexical items can be composed to yield strings of that language. It is at least conceptually possible that two distinct languages with very different grammars could have been developed using the same lexicon and associating the same meanings to each lexical element. 

This also seems no particular problem. The meanings of words in a language do alter over time, yes. That means if I read a letter written in English in 1500, and interpret it according to the prevailing meanings of its words in the English of 2011, I will likely misconstrue the writer's meaning. But, all is not lost. I can instead interpret the letter according to the meanings of its terms that prevailed in the English of 1500 (as best as I can discover them). Not having anything quite so good as the Oxford English Dictionary for many of the languages in which various religious texts are written, the problem might be harder to resolve in those cases. But, unsurprisingly, there is a great deal of scholarship on the languages in which those texts are written. So, while "text of divine origin" is not one of my concepts, I don't see that any of the considerations that you have pointed to pose any particular problems for the claim that this or that text has a divine origin. 

For the purposes of this question, take the Cultural Relativist Thesis to be the claim that what actions are right and wrong is a function of the which actions the norms of one's culture endorse as right and condemn as wrong. Say that that thesis works for a member of an isolated and culturally homogeneous hunter gatherer cultural group. For members of contemporary "modern" societies, there seems to be a problem that does not arise for the members of isolated and homogeneous groups. We all are members of multiple cultures at one time. Consider, for example, a liberal Catholic native French-speaking resident of the Canadian Province of Manitoba. She belongs to Canadian, Manitoban, Francophone, Franco-Manitoban, Catholic and liberal Catholic cultures. She likely also belong to other subcultures based on her profession and hobbies. On at least some moral issues, these various cultural affiliations will pull in different directions. For instance, overall, Canadian culture supports same sex marriage, Catholic culture does not, and support for same sex marriage is lower in the Prairie provinces (such as Manitoba) then the more populous provinces. So, how do proponents of the Cultural Relativist Thesis respond to the difficulty that, for most people in the world, there is no one unique culture to which they belong and that the various cultures to which a person belongs may provide both the verdicts of "right" and of "wrong" for some particular actions? 

There isn't anything wrong with justifying a claim that Peano Arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete by reference to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems; the claim is a direct application of the first Incompleteness Theorem. Gödel showed that any formal system of adequate expressive power for doing formal arithmetic was either inconsistent or incomplete in the sense that there would be sentences in the language of that system which that system could neither prove nor refute. Tarski's theorem showed that no consistent formal language could define its own truth predicate. A a special case of that, no consistent formal system of arithmetic can include a predicate which applies to all and only the true sentences of arithmetic in the language of that formal system (and, on the intended interpretation of that language). Smullyan's point, as I understand it, is that: 1) With the result that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in a system of arithmetic, Tarski "almost" got Gödel's results. 2) Much of the (somewhat sloppy) philosophical discussion about Gödel's theorems takes them to be showing that there are unprovable arithmetical truths. However, Gödel's proofs of his theorems were expressed purely syntactically in that they made no reference to truth but only to formal provability within a purely syntactically defined formal system. Indeed since Tarski gave the first satisfactory definition of truth for formal systems in 1936, whereas Gödel's results were published in 1931, there was no formally tractable notion of truth available to Gödel. Essentially, Gödel found a clever way in which to interpret arithmetical sentences as being about formal proofs in arithmetic and constructed a sentence that "said" of itself that it was not provable within the system of arithmetic. If the system is consistent that sentence will be true. However, Gödel's conclusion was not that there were unprovable truths; rather it was that every system adequate for arithmetic is either inconsistent or would have arithmetical sentences the system did not decide. This in no way invokes a concept of truth. 3) The point of Gödel's theorems is that arithmetic is not mechanistically decidable. Tarski's point is that no consistent system can define a truth predicate for the language in which it is articulated. Of the two, Tarski's seems to have richer philosophical import. (For instance, no formal model of English could define "true in English" while Gödel's results do not seem to apply to English at all.) I am unaware of any example "proof" where appeal is made to Gödel that really ought be made to Tarski in the way your questions asks. (But, it is a big world.) 

Very few, if any, philosophical systems are really presented in an "axioms and their consequences" manner. I'm going to read the question as asking if their are any systems which provided arguments for the existence of a soul in a manner that isn't question begging. (Whether those arguments are satisfactory or persuasive is a different issue.) A lot hangs on just what you mean by "a metaphysical soul." Depending on what you mean, these may not meet the bill. Descartes argued that we could not rationally doubt the existence of our minds (which he identified with our soul), but we could doubt the existence of our bodies. On this ground, he took the mind to be metaphysically distinct from the body. Plato, chiefly in the Republic and the Timaeus argued that we cannot know anything about the physical world as it is in flux, but can know only about the forms. In the Meno, he argued that "learning" is actually recollection of the forms, where we recall what we once knew before the trauma of birth so shocked our persistent soul that we forgot our former knowledge. Neither of these are straightforward arguments from n premises to the conclusion that souls exist, but then in the context of a philosophical system, one rarely gets such extractable arguments for key claims. Both arguments for the existence of souls are, of course, the subject of hundreds of years of critical commentary. There are also many other examples that could be provided. (For instance, the Stoics held that souls were necessary for awareness.) 

For the moment, assume that there is a God and that He approves of and commands that which is morally right. In a question first raised by Plato in the Euthyphro, one can still inquire which way the conceptual priority runs: 

If one adopts the first alternative, then God's approvals and disapprovals are constitutive of right and wrong. On the second, there are (somehow) facts about right and wrong that are not conceptually dependent upon God's commands and approvals. The first alternation is the Divine Command Theory of morality. It is, within the Christian tradition at least, a decidedly minority view. It has several serious problems: 

Yes, it would. But, I don't see how that in itself poses a problem for the claim that a given text has a divine origin. If one thinks of God (or the gods) as intervening in human affairs, one could happily say that human language developed and at some point God chose to communicate to the humans, doing so in the language that they had developed. It seems no different than how I can communicate with a Parisian even though French existed before I did and before I ever formed the intention to convey a message. 

I am not sure what you intend by saying that "languages are not complete." I'll interpret that as saying that there might well be messages that one would wish to convey that a given language does not provide the resources to convey. On that understanding, there also seems no problem here. If I convey a message to you in French, necessarily, the message that I do convey must be conveyable in French. If (not that I think that this is the case) there were some content that I wished to convey which English could express and French could not, it wouldn't be possible for me to convey the entire message that I wished to convey. It isn't "convenient" that what I do convey is expressible in French; it is a necessary consequence of my selecting French as the vehicle of communication. It could well be that God might have wished to convey a message to us in a human language where that message was not expressible in the human language. That seems little different than the cases that arise when you speak to young children or adults who are not fluent in the language that you are communicating in---you select a sub-language of the language you are speaking, picked so as to be understandable to your audience. Sometimes, in so doing, you lose the ability to say that which you would like to say. 

The question seems to presuppose contemporary sources are the best way in to philosophy. I'd like to reject that assumption. Much contemporary work is technical and involved and thus not a good entry point. There are plenty of texts written as introductions to the field that aim to be less technical and involved, and some of them are even good. None, however, are clearly as good as many of the classic (and, relatively accessible) works in philosophy. Someone looking for a way in to contemporary philosophy would, in my view, be best advised to start with Descartes' Meditations, Berkeley's Three Dialogues, Mill's On Liberty, or the like. Almost certainly, time spent reading these will be better repaid than is time spent reading contemporary introductions. From there, follow up an issue of interest in the texts by consulting something like The Cambridge Companion to X and this will give a way in to some of the contemporary debates about that historical text.
