It sometimes happens that 1D problems are easier to solve by somehow adding a dimension. For example, we convert linear differential equations for a real unknown to a complex unknown (to use complex exponentials), or we compute a power series' radius of convergence by thinking in the complex plane (or use complex analytic properties in path integrals), or we evaluate $\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{-x^2}\ dx$ by squaring it... So, are any 2D problems easier to solve in even higher dimensions? I can't think of any. 

Is anything known asymptotically about the binary "primes mod 3" sequence besides Dirichlet's result that 1 and 2 occur half of the time? For example, can you prove that it does not eventually cycle forever with a simple "12" repetition? (I would guess that this sequence is asymptotically random with no correlations, but it really wouldn't be that surprising if, for example, there were some tendency to switch back and forth in consecutive terms. If anyone has an argument, or data, indicating that this sequence is not so random, I'd like to hear about it.) 

Is there any integer N such that 2^N=3 mod N? I understand that N must be an odd non-prime. I checked up to a million with no success (but, FYI, 2^N=5 and 2^N=7 have solutions). 

I can prove the required cohomology vanishing if you require that $V$ be Cohen-Macaulay. Write $U$ for $\mathbb{C}^4 \setminus V$. We have the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence: $H^q(U, \Omega^p) \implies H^{p+q}(U, \mathbb{C})$. Singe $U$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$, we have $\Omega^p \cong \mathcal{O}^{\oplus \binom{n}{p}}$ so $H^q(U, \Omega^p) \cong H^q(U, \mathcal{O})^{\bigoplus \binom{n}{p}}$. We can identify $H^q(U, \mathcal{O})$ with a local cohomology module of $V$, which the Cohen-Macaulay condition should force to be $0$ for $q > n-k-1$. So $H^q(\Omega^p)$'s will be zero for $q>n-k-1$. Then the spectral sequence immediately forces cohomology to vanish for $p+q > n+(n-k-1)$, as you desired. I have no idea of how to get a statement in homotopy out of the Cohen-Macaulay condition. 

As Alex Woo says, this is a toric example, and hence can be solved with toric methods. Your variety is $\mathrm{Spec} \ \mathbb{C}[S]$ where $S$ is the semigroup ring generated by $(1,0,0,1)$, $(0,1,0,1)$, $(0,0,1,1)$, $(0,0,0,1)$ and $(1,1,1,2)$. (These correspond to the variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $y_1$ and $y_2$ respectively.) This is a saturated semigroup, so toric methods apply with no subtleties. The dual cone is generated by $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(-1,-1,0,1)$, $(-1,0,-1,1)$, $(0,-1,-1,1)$. Toric resolutions of this singularity correspond to triangulations of this cone. Notice that the six generators of the dual cone all lie in the plane $w+x+y+3z=1$. In this plane, they form a triangular prism. We can draw our pictures in three coordinates by discarding the final coordinate. However, we need to recognize that, if we do this, a lattice point means a point $(x,y,z)$ such that $x+y+z \equiv 1 \mod 3$. (This is the point I screwed up earlier.) So we want to understand triangulations of the prism with vertices $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,0,1)$, $(0,-1,-1)$, $(-1,0,-1)$, $(-1,-1,0)$. Now, suppose that our subdivision has a face $d$ which is contained in a face of the triangular prism of dimension $e$. The cones on these faces have dimension $d+1$ and $e+1$; the corresponding torus orbits have dimension $3-d$ and $3-e$, so the fibers here have dimension $e-d$. So smallness means that $2(e-d) < e+1$. For $e=0$, $1$, $2$, $3$ this gives $d \geq 0$, $1$, $1$ and $2$, respectively. In other words, we must add no new vertices to the triangular prism, and we may only add new edges within $2$-faces. Fortunately, the standard triangulation of the triangular prism has this property. There are three tetrahedra: $$\mathrm{Hull} {\Large (} (1,0,0), \ (0,1,0), \ (0,0,1), \ (0,-1,-1) {\Large )}$$ $$\mathrm{Hull} {\Large (} (0,1,0), \ (0,0,1), \ (0,-1,-1), \ (-1,0,-1) {\Large )}$$ $$\mathrm{Hull} {\Large (} (0,0,1), \ (0,-1,-1), \ (-1,0,-1), \ (-1,-1,0) {\Large )}$$ In my previous update, I worried that these are not unimodular, because the "lattice point" $(0,0,0)$ lay on the $2$-faces of some of them. However, that is actually not a lattice point. (It corresponds to $(0,0,0,1/3)$ back in $4$-space.) Sorry about the confusion. 

Given coprime positive integers M,N, and a corresponding integer z outside of the range (for all integers x,a,b,c) of $Mx^2-N(a^2+b^2+c^2)$, is there any such z which is "deceptive", meaning that it is modularly inside the range of the smaller components, i.e., inside the range of both $Mx^2$ mod N and $-N(a^2+b^2+c^2)$ mod M? Feel free to replace $a^2+b^2+c^2$ with "All integers except for $4^a(8b+7)$" per Lagrange. 

Given two vector sets, $\vec x_i$ and $\vec y_i$ (for $i$=1,2,...N, but the dimensionality of each vector can be more than N), let their sum set be $\vec z_i = \vec x_i + \vec y_i$. It's easy to compute the scalar inter-distances: $x_{ij} = \Vert{\vec x_i-\vec x_j}\Vert$, $y_{ij} = \Vert{\vec y_i-\vec y_j}\Vert$, $z_{ij} = \Vert{\vec z_i-\vec z_j}\Vert$. But, what's the quickest computation method to go backwards (i.e., from all of the inter-distances to any "high-dimensional embedding")? It seems I'm forced into ugly numerical "trial and error" methods even for small N=4 though there are easy analytical methods (for any N) if I didn't need to match the sum's inter-distances. 

Dirichlet's theorem shows that, for any fixed prime integer a, "big prime numbers mod a" are uniformly distributed between 1 and a-1. If we similarly pick different prime integers b,c,..., are these uniform distributions independent of each other? 

I assigned the lower bound early on in my graph theory course. Solutions for $d=2$ and $d=3$ are easy to find. Then, last week, when I covered eigenvalue methods, I had people use them to show that there were no solutions for $d=4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$ or $10$. (Problem 2 here.) I can go beyond this and show that the only possible values are $d \in \{ 2,3,7,57 \}$, and I wrote this up in a handout for my students. Does anyone know if the last two exist? I'd like to tell my class the complete story. 

I assume you want to fix the prime $p$, and I assume you want $f$ to be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. If you don't fix $p$, then $x-6$ is a counter-example (there are two valuations for which $v(6)>0$, but $x-6 \neq (x-6)^2$, even up to units.) If $f$ is not the minimimal polynomial then $(x-2)(x-4)$ is a counterexample. Subject to these caveats, you are right. I find it really confusing to multiply over all places as you are doing. What I would rather do is the following: Fix a normal extension $L$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ in which $f$ splits. Let $\alpha_1$, ..., $\alpha_N$ be the roots of $f$ in $L$. Factor $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ as $g_1 g_2 \cdots g_k$ and group the $\alpha_i$ together if they are roots of the same $g_j$. Fix an extension $v$ of the $p$-adic valuation to $L$. Then there are $k$ different $p$-adic valuations of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. They each arise as follows: For each $g_i$, choose a root $\alpha_i$ and let $\phi_i : \mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \to L$ be the map induced by $\alpha \mapsto \alpha_i$. Then your valuation is $v \circ \phi_i$. Suppose that $v(\alpha_i)>0$ for the roots of $g_1$, $g_2$, ..., $g_s$ and $v(\alpha_i) \leq 0$ for $g_{s+1}$, \cdots, $g_r$. So you are interested in the first $s$ valuations. Here are the lemmas you need; I'll leave them as exercises. I'm pretty sure they work. Lemma 1: For $i>s$, the polynomial $g_i$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}_p[[x]]$ Lemma 2: For $i \leq s$, the polynomial $g_i$ can be written as $h_i u_i$ where $u_i$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}_p[[x]]$ and $h_i \in \mathbb{Z}[[x]]$. Lemma 3: The kernel of $\mathbb{Z}[[x]] \mapsto L_v$, where $x$ goes to a root of $g_i$, is generated by $h_i$. Proof of Lemma 3: If the map were from $\mathbb{Z}_p[[x]]$, then the kernel would be generated by $g_i$. Since $h_i = g_i u_i^{-1}$, we see that $h_i$ is in the kernel. If $q$ is in the kernel, then $q=g_i v = h_i u_i v$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p[[x]]$. Since $h_i$ and $q$ are both in $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$, we see that the coefficients of $u_i v$ are in $\mathbb{Q}$, so they are in $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $q$ is a multiple of $h_i$ in $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$. We take $h_i$ as your representative of the kernel. Then $f$ is $\prod h_i$ times a unit $u$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p[[x]]$. But $f$ and $\prod h_i$ are both in $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$, so $u$ and $u^{-1}$ are in $\mathbb{Q}[[x]]$ and we deduce that $u$ is a unit of $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$, as desired. 

Let's represent integers with D digits where each digit has B values (i.e., the base is B and we effectively work only with integers between 1 and B^D). Is it possible to choose a single cyclic/repeating stream of B^D digits and D relative position "windows" (to look into that stream and filter out the digits we view) such that all integers come out? As an example, for D=3 and B=3, the stream "1 2 1 2 3 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 3 3 3 3" with window positions at "1 11 18" generates the full range of integers exactly once per cycle (the first integer generated is 112, then 212, ...). I'm actually looking for an answer for D=4 and B=4 if there is no general method. 

Since Gerry Myerson is too humble to take answer credit, I'll make it even simpler and close out my stupid question: $0^2+(x+1)^2-x^2=2x+1$ ranges all odds, so $1^2+(x+1)^2-x^2$ ranges all evens. Just 3 integers are enough (a is 0, b is 0 or 1, c is x+1). 

Computer multiplication can be sped up by looking for patterns and re-writing this with minimal additions/subtractions (in terms of simple zero-cost bitshifts). To keep 64-bit accuracy, the best I could do was 13 steps: 

I can sort of give you a pointer to the literature. Rename your points $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_{n}$ and $z$ with $x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_{n}$. Let $q(t)$ be the degree $n-1$ Lagrange interpolating polynomial for $f$ through $(x_i, f(x_i))$. Then the degree $n$ Lagrange interpolating polynomial through the $(x_i, f(x_i))$ and $(z, f(z))$ is $$r(t) = q(t) + \frac{f(z)-q(z)}{\prod (z-x_i)} \prod (t-x_i).$$ You want to know that there is some $c \in (\min(x_1,z), \max(x_n,z))$ where $f^{(n)}(c) = r^{(n)}(c)$. In other words, where $f^{(n)}(c) = \frac{f(z) - q(z)}{\prod (z-x_i)} n!$. You can rearrange this to give $$f(z) = q(z) + \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!} \prod (z-x_i).$$ This is a known formula for the error in Lagrange interpolation. Here is a Wikipedia article. The case where $x_1=x_2=\cdots = x_n$ is Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder; Tim Gowers has a nice blog post. Comments on Prof. Gowers' post suggest that Atkinson’s Intro to Numerical Analysis would give you a more official source; I haven't read it. I don't know a source where the $n+1$ points are treating on equal footing, but my ignorance of analysis literature is no sign that it doesn't exist. 

Here is a sketch of an alternate proof of the claim; making this rigorous may be harder than the approach you take. Let $G$ be the lie group corresponding to the lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. So $G$ acts on $\mathfrak{g}$. $G$-invariant functions are, as the name suggests, invariant under this action. If $x$ is nilpotent then we can use the $G$-action to move $x$ into the nilradical $\mathfrak{n}_+$. Let $\psi: \mathbb{C}^* \to T$ be a one parameter subgrop that paris positively with the positive roots. So, for $x$ in $\mathfrak{n}_+$, we have $\lim_{t \to 0} \psi(t) x=0$. So $0$ is in the closure of $Gx$ and, if $f$ is $G$ invariant, we must have $f(x)=f(0)$. In particular, if $f$ is $G$-invariant and has positive degree, then $f(x)=0$. 

How can I most quickly find a big prime, p, for which 4p+1 is also prime? For example, p=37 works. I wonder if these special primes have been researched and some characteristics are known. Are there infinitely many of these primes? 

In the simplest asymmetric Colonel Blotto game with 2 players, dividing their given Ni soldiers (i=1,2) over 2 battlefields, what are their expected utilities, Ui (i.e., expected number of battlefield victories), in a Nash Equilibrium? If the continuum Ni case is significantly easier to solve, you can consider the individual soldiers to be divisible. I’d also like to see an explicit Nash Equilibrium strategy for the two players, but it seems that there might be many cases, so it can’t be written down simply. 

What is the maximum number of spheres that can be placed in 3D such that all inter-touch? One can of course place four unit spheres tetrahedrally and then add a smaller sphere in the middle, so this number must be at least 5. [By the way, I was trying to extend the "five points in 2D cannot be inter-connected without a crossing" limitation to 3D with a simple statement, but this was sadly the best I could do. If anyone knows a better simple extension, please comment.] 

OK, I've got it. There is no such local criterion for squareness. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not $2$. Take the ring of triples $(f,g,h) \in k[t]^3$, subject to the conditions that $f(1)=g(-1)$, $g(1)=h(-1)$ and $h(1)=f(-1)$. Consider the element $(t^2,t^2,t^2)$. If this were a square, its square root would have to be $(\pm t, \pm t, \pm t)$. But two of those $\pm$'s would be the same sign, and $t$ evaluated at $1$ and at $-1$ are not equal. Now, to check that $(t^2, t^2, t^2)$ is everywhere locally a square. Geometrically, we are talking about three lines glued into a triangle. Any prime ideal has a neighborhood which is contained in the union of two neighboring lines, say the first two. On the first two lines, $(-t, t, 1)$ is a square root of $(t^2, t^2, t^2)$. For the suspicious, an algebraic proof. Set $u_1=(0, (1+t)/2, (1-t)/2)$ and let $u_2$ and $u_3$ be the cyclic permutations thereof. We have $u_1+u_2+u_3=1$ so, in any local ring, one of the $u_i$ must be a unit. WLOG, suppose that $u_1$ is a unit. Notice that $u_1 (1, -t, t)^2 = u_1 (t^2, t^2, t^2)$. So, in a local ring where $u_1$ is a unit, $(1,t,-t)$ is a square root of $(t^2, t^2, t^2)$. 

I assume that this optimization problem is not studied much in math since there was no response to my original post (please see my original version for a few more details though its solution used more steps). So, is there a solution with fewer steps than 13? Better yet, is there any systematic method/theory for finding a minimal 128-bit solution? Notice that I could have asked this problem for any number, like 99 (instead of pi), so I was hoping that there might be some number theory devoted to it. To be clear, in this problem, for each step (e.g., defining x08), you are free to choose two previously-defined variables (e.g., chosen from x01 to x07), their two bitshifts (integers from -infinity to +infinity), and their two inclusion signs (positive or negative). The code above uses # signs to show these six variable columns. 

I have many polynomial equations in many variables which I want to jointly minimize (in a mean square sense, but you could pick a different reasonable measure which favors anything where all quantities go to zero). For example, I am looking to make the 6 equations below as "small" as possible (a-j are unknown real numbers). This example probably actually has a solution where all equations are zero, but I also have cases which have no zero solution, so I'd rather not do the "repeatedly eliminate variables and solve for the quadratic root" approach (also, this approach takes too long; is there even any machine which could find a full zero for these equations within 10 minutes?). I'm thinking there might be some software tool that considers the "terrain" smartly and is locally minimizing on many global fronts...or maybe that is impractical. So, is there a free math tool (like Sage) which can minimize things for me (and be certain that no other point is better within some tolerance)? I'm open to theoretical advice, but feel like the options will all look like brute force. Should I give up if I need to minimize a similar set of equations within 10 minutes on one machine?
