I doubt there's a completely standard definition. It seems like this is elementary -- an undirected edge is a size-$k$ subset of $[1,n]$, and a directed edge is an undirected edge together with one of the possible $2^k$ labellings of it with "T" and "H". So the number of different edges is (if, say, empty head- and tail-sets are allowed) $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n$ Presumably a directed hypergraph consists of any collection of such edges, so there are $2^{3^n}$ of them. If this isn't the precise question you were wondering about, I'd wager that the one you're interested in is just as easy to count. 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

I would like to understand the complexity of "equality of Borel sets". By complexity, I mean the complexity in the sense of Borel reducibility. Of course, since there is no standard Borel space of Borel sets of a Polish space, we have to work with Borel codes to make sense of "equality of Borel sets". Here is a nice paper by Clemens. In Section 1, he explains how we construct the space of Borel codes and what "equality of Borel sets" means (see Definition 8). Let $E_B$ be the equivalence relation on Borel codes defined as follows: Two Borel codes are $E_B$-equivalent if and only if they define the same Borel set. It can be seen that the equivalence relation $E_B$ on the set of Borel codes is not a Borel equivalence relation (for example, see the remarks in Page 5). The set of Borel codes is not even a Borel set. On the other hand, if we fix some $\alpha < \omega_1$, then the set ${BC}_{\alpha}$ of Borel codes of rank less than $\alpha$ is a Borel set. My question is whether or not $E_{\alpha}$, equivalence of Borel codes of rank less than $\alpha$, is Borel? I specifically want to know if this is true when $\alpha$ is finite (more specifically, $\alpha=4$). My first reaction was to carry out an induction argument trying to bound $E_{\alpha}$ from above by using jumps or powers of the previous bounds but I can't seem to figure out what to do. I suspect that these relations might not be Borel even for small finite values. 

Pick a spanning tree of the ski trail map, e.g. by depth-first search or something. You can traverse it by always turning left at a junction. As you're doing this, walk out and back along each edge that's not in the tree. This uses each edge exactly twice. 

where v is the vector [0, 0, ... 0, 1]. I'm pretty sure it'd be easy to prove this inductively, as A itself has a similar block structure - though I confess I haven't done it. EDIT: Here's the sage code that produces the matrix. Obviously it's not the smartest way to go about doing things, but it was adequate. If anyone knows a smarter but equally terse way of iterating over the power set than converting it to a list, let me know! 

Alexander the Great is staring at the Gordian Knot, bewildered. Absentmindedly he fingers the hilt of his trusty sword. On the sword is inscribed the words: "Change the order of summation". Mathematics is full of multiple-sum computations in which the crucial step is to change the order of summation. Unlike Alexander, though, I often see no conceputally clear reason why it ought to make the answer fall out. It is so unreasonably effective that I am tempted to do it without even thinking. Is there some unifying reason why one should try changing the order of summation? Or, to put it another way, maybe this is confirmation bias talking. Are there interesting computations where it's possible to change the order of summation, but the correct approach is not to change it? 

I think the following result of Greg Martin related to this question deserves to be mentioned here. (It is already referenced in Chapter 3 of the book "Research Problems in Discrete Geometry" by P. Brass, W. O. J. Moser and J. Pach, which is mentioned in the accepted answer.) Theorem: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the countable collection of rectangles with dimensions $\frac{1}{1} \times \frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4}$, $\dots$ . If $\mathcal{A}$ can be packed into a square of area $1+\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon > 0$, then $\mathcal{A}$ can be packed into a square of area $1$. The proof is a compactness argument. Under a suitable topology, valid packings (of various packing problems) form compact subsets of the space of all possible positionings of the tiles. If the weakened problem can be solved for every $\frac{1}{k} >0$, then one can extract a subsequence of the sequence of these solutions which converges to a solution of the problem. 

Every natural number can be written as the sum of four integer squares. (As opposed to the case of three integer squares, which requires certain hypothesis.) 

This is an answer, but my insight is hardly a mathematical one. Nonetheless, here we go: The 1955 paper of Turán is, in fact, published in both English and Chinese in the same journal. The Chinese version is pages 411-417 in the journal; the English language version is pages 417 - 423. Turán writes: "I am pretty sure that on the way one can evaluate $M_n(6)$ or $S_n(6)$ after a little longer calculations and also further." But he doesn't give a formula. 

Propp redoes, clarifies and generalizes domino shuffling in the following lovely paper: Propp, James. "Generalized domino-shuffling." Theoretical Computer Science 303, no. 2 (2003): 267-301. $URL$ The redone explanation is a way of thinking of the domino shuffle map locally, using a graph transformation called urban renewal; these days people also call it the spider move. The move replaces a 4-cycle in a graph (the "square", we might call it) with an 8-vertex graph made of a 4-cycle with a pendant edge on each vertex (the "spider"); the feet of the spider get attached where the vertices of the square were. Spider moves, when combined with a suitable reweighting of the edges in the graph, preserve the generating function for perfect matchings up to an explicit constant. The argument is much like the one in Elkies-Kuperberg-Larsen-Propp which you're asking about, but it is substantially streamlined because you only have to think about the square and the spider. In answer to your question: once you understand this point of view, odd-deficiency is obvious. When you reconstruct the domino shuffle using spider moves (which Propp explains how to do in the same paper), the squares and the spiders comprise the odd blocks, and all the action happens within them. The even blocks do not enter into the picture at all. As further evidence that the spider move is the correct point of view, Kenyon-Goncharov $URL$ recently used the spider move to define a certain cluster integrable system for the dimer model. 

Perhaps, your confusion may be resolved by realizing that we do not define what a set is, using the axioms of ZFC. Sets are to us like points are to Euclid. Sets are the primitive objects that we are going to work with. Let me take a Platonist approach to elaborate. When you set up your axiomatic system, which is ZFC in this case, you assume that there is a universe of objects over which your quantification takes places. (Otherwise, you cannot attach semantics to your system.) Sets are simply the objects in the universe. Nothing more, nothing less. When you include a binary relation symbol $\in$ in the language of your axiomatic system, you assume that between any two objects $x$ and $y$ in your universe, the atomic formula $x \in y$ is either true or false. So, the answer to your question "what is the domain of this function?" is the following: The Platonic universe of sets, which is somewhere in the sky! Whether a sentence such as $\forall x \exists y \neg y \in x$ is true or not depends on whether for every set $x$ there is a set $y$ such that $x \in y$ does not hold. Since we do not have direct access to the Platonic universe of sets via our usual senses, we cannot directly check if this is the case. Consequently, we postulate that some statements about the universe of sets are true, namely, the axioms of ZFC. We then study the logical consequences of these axioms. Notice that the statement $\emptyset \in \omega$ is not true because we have some kind of logical function $\cdot \in \omega$ which checks the membership for $\omega$. It is true because it follows from the axioms which posit various facts about the relation $x \in y$. I admit that I don't fully understand what your problem is. But as you can see, you may give a meaning to all these without circular reasoning. You may also take a formalist approach and simply think of the game of proving the logical consequences of the axioms of ZFC without worrying about questions such as "what is a set?", "what does $x \in y$ mean?". 

You probably know the following already. Oh, well. Anyway, Eric Nordenstam and I answered exactly this problem. It is a special case of Theorem 1 in our preprint, $URL$ and it also appears in the proceedings of FPSAC 2012. Our method was inspired (and suggested) by Krattenthaler: We guessed the answer from empirical data, and then proved our guess was right by multiplying the matrices out and confirming that the answer was the identity matrix. 

None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

You could symmetrize an arbitrary function by averaging it over the symmetric group. Explicitly: take your favourite function $h$ in $n$ variables, and set $f(r_1, ..., r_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma} h(r_{\sigma(1)}, ..., r_{\sigma(n)})$ where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,...,n$. I'd love to hear of an example which isn't obtained by symmetrization! edit: heh. Any such example would be its own symmetrization. So I guess in some sense this is a complete, if overly glib, answer. 

How about an infinite (strictly) descending sequence in a well-founded relation? It does not have a special name because it does not exist for trivial reasons. But it fits the description, there are tons of proofs where people construct infinite descending sequences of natural numbers, ordinals etc. 

We can consider Cantor's diagonalization argument as a Borel map taking a sequence of reals and producing a real different than any element in the sequence. This theorem tells you that there is no Borel way to do diagonalization in a "uniform" way. "Uniform" here means that the sequences consisting of the same elements are diagonalized with the same element. This is the most basic version of Friedman's Borel diagonalization theorem. In On the necessary use of abstract set theory, Advances in Mathematics, 41 (1981), 209-280, Harvey Friedman proves this result (Proposition C, p. 229) using a forcing argument. Though, in the appendix of the same paper, he gives another proof based on the Baire category theorem. An unusual feature of this proof is that you pass to a different space and apply Baire category to ${\mathbb{R}}^{\mathbb{N}}$ where $\mathbb{R}$ is endowed with the discrete topology.
