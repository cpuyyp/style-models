Two possibilities. If you're an employee, figuring out a way to do your work 10 times faster is your problem. Your employer has hired you for a task in exchange for a salary. If the task is done, you deserve the salary. End of story. Why? Because the crazy amount of studies you put yourself into, and which today allows you to be that performant, doesn't belong to your employer. It belongs to you. So if your employer wants you to get more done, he has to pay more. Automation is not work you did today, it's work you did years before and which enables you to be over-performing today. If you're an associate, then the company's interests are aligned with your interests. Then you should act accordingly. The fact that your employer gives you a salary and no capital in exchange for your work proves that your interests are not aligned with the company's interests. If your employer is not happy with that, he can either: 

There are two things to consider and as requested, I'll try to make a general answer. First, the question of how will you get your first contract. Freelancers usually use references and previous work to get contracts. You claim you have no references in this field and no "real" previous work. So you can count only on your persuading skills. You should begin with small projects first so that you can easier convince a potential customer to go with you, and it will allow you to build a portfolio which can get you more contracts later. Second, the question of how you will manage to satisfy your first customer. Suppose you managed to get a contract, congrats: 1/10 of the work is done. Because now you have to deliver so that this first experience translates into a reliable reference. All that said, regarding your question or whether "you're ready or not" - I've seen many freelancers claiming to be "experts" in such field, and it appeared they were really not that proficient. It doesn't mean that you have to do the same and it's not intended to make people lower their mediocrity acceptance threshold. Just that if you have sufficient soft skills and you kind-of know your way in the technical stuff you want to use, then it seems quite doable to get your first contracts. Technically speaking, don't listen to people bashing at freelancers who are in the habit of "learning stuff at the expense of their customers". People (freelancers, employee) are always learning things at the expense of their customers/employers. Except the ones that decide to settle. 

Search engines can help you. Google has tools to help you do this. I don't think Google is blocked in Hong Kong, but if it is you can always use a Chinese search engine like Baidu to similar effect. Google offers an option to display only results from Hong Kong (enter search terms, hit enter, tools menu, country selection). If you have a Google account you can also specify which languages you want results in, so limit it to English. Then search for English terms like "jobs" and "english speaking". When I tried this I saw several sites such as www.indeed.hk and jobsinhongkong.com that are dedicated to English speaking users, and have options to filter by jobs that accept English-only applicants. Similarly, you can search for phrases like "location hong kong". Combined with "careers" or "recruitment" that seems to turn up a few employers with offices there. 

Your health is the most important thing by far. Stress can result in permanent health problems if not treated, so don't try to soldier on if your doctor advises you not to. I have a permanent, incurable disability caused by stress, so learn from my mistake. From an employment point of view mental health issues are no different to physical ones, e.g. if you broke your leg or got the flu. You have a date when you expect to be recovered that you can give to your new employer. In a way it's actually a good test of the new employer, to see how they handle this issue. If they handle it badly, maybe they are not the best place for you. Hopefully they will be understanding, I think the Netherlands is a pretty progressive place when it comes to mental health issues. 

It's also possible that you don't have any room for evolution in this particular company, in which case you should leave. It's also possible that you don't want to do something radically different, you just don't feel like working in that team or on that project or in that company anymore. Perhaps it's the neighbourhood, the color of the walls, perhaps it's something else; anyway your feelings of boredom and guiltiness are telling you that you don't want to keep on those tracks anymore. Do you see yourself stuck in that situation, having to do something that doesn't bring you any fun by now, and does not challenge your intellect anymore to the point that you're just bored to death about it, afraid to talk about your boredom with your boss, until you retire? If not, it might indeed be time to make a change. 

Remember that as a recruiter/boss/manager, it's his job to look friendly/honest/fine in order to keep people coming to work at his place. In no case it means that he really is. Makes me think of people who buy something because "the salesman was nice and appeared honest". Yeah, it's just his full-time job to appear nice and honest. 

Answer is quite simple here, really. Just leave this company right away and never look back. If you stay, youâ€™re doing a massive disservice to yourself and to the whole community of developers at large, by sending the message that among this community, there are people willing to encounter such ridiculous conditions without running away on the spot, no questions asked. 

What you really want to know is if family friendly policies will result in undue burden on yourself. Assuming you don't have some strange notion of "fairness" in not wanting parents to look after their children properly, your real concern is the effect on you. You can ask companies directly about this. Simply state that in the past you have been overloaded or distracted by these policies, and would like to know how this company deals with them. Seeking out companies that don't have a family friendly policy could easily backfire - if they don't give parents basic support, what other kinds of poor working conditions do they have? Do they account for every minute of your day, are the inflexible when you need unexpected extra time off for some reason (e.g. sick relatives, funerals etc)? 

Send them another message giving a date for the end of your employment. State clearly that you will cease to work for them after that date. Make sure you have evidence that it was received, e.g. registered mail or email reading receipt. That's all you need to do. If they fail to act it's their problem. Concentrate on your next job. 

The question is vague, as you have realised. Instead of worrying about the exact meaning, consider what the purpose of asking it is. They want to filter out candidates with little experience or understanding, so ask yourself: 

My main point is: nowadays a lot of people (especially here on the Workplace - see the current most upvoted answer) tend to confuse being an employee and being an associate. Employers take advantage of this confusion. Don't fall into that trap. Forget the BS about "team spirit", "we're in the same boat", etc. This is just marketing (directed towards employees). If your employer wants you in his boat, he has to make you an associate. Employee: you're paid for a task. The company's interests are not your interests. Once the task is done, you're done. The amount of time you put into it doesn't count. Associate: the company's interests are your interests. Act accordingly. 

Those criterias have no solid foundation at all, and are in no way related to the quality of the work you'll provide. Lastly, you say: 

To me, it simply looks like you've got bored to death with your job. You already proved you can do what's expected from you now and now it's done you don't have the energy to repeat yourself. The good news is it's a sign of intellectual strength - you're just not a code monkey and you can deliver only when the job represents a challenge to you. So go ahead and talk with your boss, but not about your underperformance. Rather about the fact that you performed really well with your current level of assignments, and that your boss could use this ability to a higher level. Your sense of guiltiness may not come from your underperformance but from your inability to take a bold move and say : 

You should avoid sharing your current salary details. It can only ever work against you. All that information will be used for is to calibrate the offer they make you to be as low as possible while still tempting you away from your current job. This punishes people who are loyal (switching jobs often usually increases salary faster than yearly raises) and who are underpaid. Remember that stating your current salary is the start of your salary negotiation. They will likely offer you around 10% more as a starting point. Its in your best interest not to start with a low number like that and try to work up, justifying a larger increase. You should give them your desired salary for the company in question, which will depend on location (cost of living/rent), type of work and what non-monetary benefits they offer. 

The company has a legal responsibility to accommodate your physical needs, under EU employment rules that will have been transposed into your country's own laws. If the chairs they provide are causing you physical pain and there is an easy solution that doesn't greatly impact your work or cost much, they are required to offer it to you. Have you made it clear to the health and safety officer that you are extremely uncomfortable? If so, and if you believe you can reasonably do your job with a different type of chair, your next step would be HR. 

French guy here. A few years ago, I've been in the exact same situation you describe, and I made the mistake of signing. The problem you'll find if you sign is not necessarily that you won't get part of your pay sooner or later. That contingency would at least prove manageable in some way. No, the real problem here is that by offering this proposal to you, they do nothing but prove a serious and irretrievable lack of culture about what is a software developer and how he works. They pretend to be a startup, but they do apply fundamentally "agency-like" reasonings. They even confessed not being capable of managing and motivating developers (the last one, in their terms, came to "do what he wanted and show only when he pleased"). Knowing nothing about software development, they want to have a trigger to better control you and better pressure you, if only unconsciously, so that you'll be tempted to shut your mouth if problems arise. And if you don't, they'll cut your pay, knowing that it would be an enormous pain in the ass for you to go legal about it (long procedures, nothing to be gained in the end...). Been there, done that. Run from this toxic environment, and find a true "startup". -- Responding to your update Your update makes me think that they felt your hesitation and changed their discourse. Remember their initial idea was of a punishment in case of professional fault. This is what they're really thinking about, even if they changed the wording afterwards. Otherwise, why would they have even mention this possibility in the first place? Additionally, their criterias ("respect of rules, implication, motivation") are all subjective:
