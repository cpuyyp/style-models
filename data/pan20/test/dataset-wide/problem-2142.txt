Generally no office is going to consider how far from work you live when asking you to do night shift. Where you live and how you get to work is your problem not the company's. Very few people want to do night shift and thus usually seniority comes into play. There may also be another business task that means the senior person needs to be on day shift such as dealing with clients. Senior people tend to have broader duties and are often doing things that the junior people are not aware of and some of these can only be done during the day shift. This is one of thereasons why the seniors get the first choice on these things. Seniors are also more valuable to the organization generally and if you have something that will make one person unhappy, companies prefer to make the least valuable person the unhappy one. Further the senior may also have personal reasons not to do the night shift such as caring for children or ill parents. His reasons may be just as valid as yours. I think it is unlikely that the senior will be convinced that he is the better choice. However, there is no reason why you can't ask him if he would be willing or if there could be a trade off where you do it sometimes and he does it sometimes. Simply set up a meeting to discuss nightshift and ask him if he would be willing. Don't come across as your needs are more important than his, that rarely works. But in reality in the workplace, the junior person is almost always going to get the least desirable tasks including things like nightshift. As you get more seniority, you will get less of these tasks. However, if night shift is out of the question for you both and you get assigned to do it, then you either need to move closer or find a different job that doesn't have night shift work or get better transportation. 

They do have less bureaucracy. This is both a plus and a minus. Great when things are going well, really bad when they are not. Questions to ask before taking a job at a startup: 

What you don't seem to be understanding is that while the job seemed perfect to you, you did not seem perfect to them. Other people did a better job than you did and thus were selected. Hiring is a competition, you did not place first. Since word is you need to wait a year, then that is what you do. You don't bug them every two weeks in the meantime either. You spend a year getting more proficient at the type of programming they do. You spend the year practicing coding tests so that you can do better on them and you spend the year making network contacts in various user groups in the hope that you will connect with some of their employees who will get to know you through your work in helping set up the XYZ conference. In the meantime, stop mooning over what might have been. That ship has sailed. Get a different job and give it your all. 

You don't need to snitch on him, just ask for him by name. Say, "Can Joe help me with ...." or "What about Joe, this coould be a good learning experience for him." Likely the manager wasn't even considering interns when he said everyone is busy. People do tend to forget they exist which may be why he has not work to do. 

Discussing the private details of an HR-related action with other people in his work group is something no manager should ever consider doing. This is highly confidential information. It is cause for firing in most companies with an HR group in the US for a manager to let confidential information out. (I can't speak for other countries, but suspect it might be in many others because betraying confidential information is serious stuff). Managers must be able to keep private information private and should have the judgement to know what is private and what can be shared. Managers are often required to keep quiet on a variety of topics including who might be promoted, who is going to be on the layoff list, who is buying the company, what other people's performance ratings are, etc. Anyone who does not know that they need to keep this stuff quiet has no business in management. If there was a policy problem that needs to be reinforced, then address that separately and not related to the firing at all. Without mentioning the fired person by name, most employees will get the message that this is a firing offense. If the firing happened for something unreasonable but not covered in a written policy (since you do not have to show cause in many US states), now is the time to make sure that the prohibited actions get spelled out in writing to avoid future violations. However, you must also consider that if you fired John for doing X and you you know that Mary is doing it as well, then you may be in trouble in a challenge to the firing if you did not also fire Mary. I have seen companies get into trouble and have it cost them a good bit of money of they choose to allow a practice for some employees that they fire others for. This is part of why all companies need an HR (either full-time or a consultant) or a labor lawyer. (Small start-ups especially as they often have no one who knows how to legally protect the company). So before you reinforce this policy, you need to get get rid of all known violators even if one of them is your best employee. We had a large company locally that ended up firing half of the staff for accessing porn at work. I am sure they were not thrilled but once one was found, then the others had to be fired as well. In the future, if you are in the US, it is often to the company's benefit to let people go with out stating a cause. There are far fewer ways to get into trouble when you do this. 

It makes a difference if HR is being asked to sit in on all reviews or only those from a specific reviewer for for specific individuals. If they are sitting in on all reviews, there may well be a complaint about the review process itself and they are investigating it. Or they may feel that the managers are in need of advice about what they cannot say or they want to get a feel for how the company is doing things if the HR person doing this is new. There may be something confidential going on in the company and want to make sure it doesn't accidentally leak during the discussions. For instance, suppose you are int eh process of being bought by a larger company, but that is not announced yet. HR may want to make sure no manager tells someone unhappy with the amount of their raise to stay because their stock options will soon be worth much more. This would be a legal issue and could kill the whole deal as well as have some people go to jail. They might just want to be able to testify that it didn't happen even if they don't think anyone would. It might even be something legal that you at your level are not aware of but they are protecting the company. If it is just one manger who has HR looking at things, then likely he or she has had a specific complaint brought up. If you are the manager, be very careful what you say. It is a common practice many places for an HR rep to be present if the performance review will be negative and the employee is in danger of getting fired. They want to make sure that the manager does nothing to give the employee a case for a law suit. They are a witness to what was said as well. And the presence of another person may make the employee less likely to react violently. In any case, as the manager, you may wish to talk to the HR person beforehand and get a feel for what they want you to say and what they want you to avoid. HR is there to protect the company in some way and that should be your goal as a manager as well so you need to know how to best protect the company. If there are issues you want to discuss privately (and they didn't come under the heading of what the HR rep told you not to say), then managers are allowed to meet with their employees any time. A good manager talks to each employee at least once a week. There is plenty of time for them to bring up delicate subjects or for you to get a feel for how they feel about delicate subjects. The performance review is not the place to do this. 

I think what you are missing seeing is that the MBA network extends well beyond the people you go to school with into the senior corporate people who also hold the same degree from the same institution. That is the network advantage as most senior level people have an MBA (it being the basic qualification for entry into the senior ranks many places) and not a certificate. This is also why it makes a huge difference which MBA program you go to. The course material is similar (altough some programs will be better inthis aspect as well), the reputation and the network is not. So if you get an MBA from Harvard, you have a network connection to all the senior managers who also got that degree from Harvard. Since the more senior the people in your network, the better job opportunities they might have for you, the better the chances of getting one of those senior jobs yourself. 

If you are working you are an adult and you should leave childish behavior behind. Yes it can affect your career. There are many things of far more of importance to the workplace if you want to get pay raises or promotions or stay employed than just doing your work on time which is after all the minimal expectation. So since you didn't give any examples of the childish behavior I can give some and how I might expect most comapnies to respond. Tantrums - you usually can only get away with these if you are in a high power position. So the CEO or the VP can have a tantrum but the average worker cannot. Excitement - usually enthusiasm is considered ok. However, you need to tone it down if the other employees are not receacting similarly. Whining about doing things you don't want to do - Generally gets you labeled as uncooperative and will result in lower pay raises and fewer opportuinituies to do the interesting work and will reduce chances of promotion. No one like s working with a whiner, so they won't put you into the best positions unless you havea skill no one else has and they can't find someone to replace you. This execption would apply to far less than 1% of the workforce. Ignoring manager instructions because you don't want to do the task or want to do things your own way- A quick route to getting fired most places. Ignoring workplace administrative rules you don't like including doing timesheets or coming in late. Making your manager find you annoying is usually not a smart move in the workplace. You have to be extra special to avoid having this stuff come back to haunt you in many workplaces. You may get away with this for awhile, but you will be first on the lay off list and get lower payraises and performance appraisals many places. If the only thing the manager ever hears about you is that you didn;t do something, then he already has a negative imporession of you and you wil have to work twice as hard to erase it. Playing games instead of working - only works long term if you are really, really far more productive than anyone else in the group or have a naive manager. The smart manager will see that you need to have far more work assigned to you and make sure it happens. There are some start-ups where this is acceptable behavior, but this often changes once they start to grow up and be a big company. A few tech companies manage to retain this, but not many and almost never in any other business sector. 

To answer the contention that it is hard to change fields once you start. That is not true. People change fields all the time, particularly when they have a degree in the field they want to change to. Further, you can use your off time to build up your qualifications for entering your field by taking more classes or doing freelance work or in the software development world, working on personal or open source projects. I have changed career fields more than 7 times. Hardly anyone stays at the same career their whole work life. Can it be more difficult, yes at times but not generally when you are entry level in any field. What can be harder is that sometimes it means you have to cut your salary to get into the field you want. So if you take that job as a Day Trader on Wall Street as a stop gap measure, it may be hard to quit to become a teacher because you would lose probably 2/3 or more of your pay. If you truly want the lesser paying field and take something that makes more as a stopgap, then handle your money as if you were only earning at the lower level as much as possible. Working is almost always preferable to not working, from the standpoint of the hiring official. There are even companies that simply toss the resumes of everyone who has been unemployed for more than 6 months. Working is also preferable because, well personally I like having a roof over my head and food to eat. 

Most hourly workers get overtime, most companies don't want to pay it, so they don't get asked to work it unless it is actually critical. They have fewer compunctions about asking salaried workers to work more than 40 hours. 

What HR can do is make sure the two people are not in a work relationship where there might be a conflict of interest by moving one of the people to a different job. They can also be monitoring the work environment around the relationship to make sure things aren't going sour or affecting others. They can be looking to see if there appears to be an element of coercion on the part of the more senior to the more junior. If there are financial accesses involved, internal controls might be bypassed with a relationship, so they are particularly aware of those times when both people needed to sign off on an action have a relationship because that makes it much easier to commit fraud. Relationships at work are 100% of the time HR's business because they always affect the work. Whether the actual effect is acceptable or not is HRs job to determine. 

My personal rules for organizational behavior (not all directly applicable to the particular situation you mentioned, but it seemed you wanted general advice not just specific advice): Rule 1 (and the most important) - never let your boss be blindsided because you didn't give him information about a potential problem. This means add him to the email chain (any potential problem generally has one) or forward past emails he wasn't copied on. And if the issue has the potential to be really big (or to come to him from someone above him) or there is no email chain, go tell him in person. Rule 2 - know who the goto people are for various things you will need. Help them out when they need it. Rule 3 - Never let another employee know you dislike them. Be polite and friendly to everyone. Rule 4 - Ask for things through the informal chain first where possible - then followup with the official request. So you tell your boss you are going to need this person and why and get his general agreement. You call the person's boss (or better yet have the boss do it) and tell him the problem and get his general agreement and tell him to expect an offical request. Then you put in the request in writing. Rule 5 - When possible go to management with a potential solution as well as the problem. And where possible fill out any required forms or paperwork for them (you may want an informal agreement to the solution before you do this) so that all they have to do is sign. Rule 6 - You don't get what you don't ask for. Rule 7 - Learn the politics of the office. If George can alawys get things done, get George on your side before a major meeting or get him to help with a request that might be hard to sell (unless your boss hates George - in politics it is generally better to err on the side of your own boss unless you know positively he is being removed). This will probably also involve helping George out when he wants something or needs help. Politics is very much about favors for favors. Rule 8 - If there is a major political war going on in your office, stay out of it as much as possible. People who aren't in positions of high power can never win by getting involved in these things. Rule 9 - Have something to trade. Be the goto person for something. Rule 10 - Get to know people. Ask about their families, express condolences when they have a death in the family. If you know he is a Giants fan and the Giants just won the Superbowl, then make sure to stop by and comment on it. Share some of your interests with them. People work better with people they like. Thought of a couple more. Rule 11 - When people are overwhelmed (this is when they are seriously overwhelmed due to an unexpected occurance like a subordinate going on emergency leave or they need to drop everything and meet a deadline becasue someone else failed to get the stuff done), volunteer to help if they are in your work group or one of your immediate bosses. This one is tricky because you don't want to do it so often they think you have no work to do and because you can't let your own work not get done because you are helping someone else. And when you do this, you may need to stay a little later to ensure your tasks don't get behind schedule. If you are asked to pick up someone else's work because they are in the hospital or on Emergency leave, do it graciously and without complaining about the state it was in (your stuff isn't perfect when it's not finished either). Rule 12 - Present things to management in busness terms. You will go a lot farther getting things you want done if you can express them in terms of increased income, decreased costs, or client satisfaction. I'm an introvert and I can do these things, so even if they don't come naturally to you (they don't to me), believe that you can do them.
