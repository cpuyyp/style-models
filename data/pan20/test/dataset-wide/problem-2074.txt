If the term isn't something instantly recognizable by the audience (potentially HR, hiring managers, and technical staff) that will read the resume, leave it out. Provide as brief an explanation of the technology as you can, but don't omit your relevant experience on the project. 

I think it might be foolish. If I were the HR person and you shared that with me, the first thing I'd do is to figure out why you kept being disqualified. Just keep that information to yourself. 

Insist that the two of you use a bug-tracking software like Bugzilla. This will cut down on the "noise" because he probably feels he has no reasonable outlet to share his concerns other than to Skype you all day long. That's nerve-wracking. A bug tracking system will force him to choose his words carefully to empower you to do your job, without all the fluff. 

If you go on this lunch, you should absolutely, positively keep your mouth shut about it! A little misinterpretation goes a long, long way. You might be accused of brown-nosing or trying to subvert your boss, when doing such a thing might be the furthest from your mind; after that, people may treat you differently. Office politics sucks. 

Usually, postings like this - if they're mentioning equity that soon - mean they're paying less than market rates, and want to entice you with the idea of the option of being a part-owner. The stock options game has been done to death with startups - it's high risk, and because it's only options, you have no say so if the company leadership torpedoes any chance of those options ever paying out. 

Let's look at this from a different angle. The laws of the land would classify this time away from your desk as not only lunch, but a lunch BREAK. And a break, by definition, means a separation of joined parts. During your break, this means that you, and only you, direct what you do and you have no obligation to justify what that is. Your team leader has some issues in respecting that boundary. I'm going to guess that this probably shows up in other ways during your work day. Continue to honor this boundary of yours, because it is a healthy one. Reinforce it by way of reading about some strategies online by which you can better assert yourself and be comfortable with saying no. 

Unless this was going to impact the actual work you were involved in, you should have stayed out of this completely. From the very start, it wasn't your responsibility to police after your team members. If they were to install said software, with knowledge aforethought of its origin, it would have no bearing upon you. You should have only raised this as an issue at the point where anyone was instructing you to install it and the failure to do so would impede your duties. So NOW, your manager is pushing this off on you to rectify -- which is improper. This is a "hot potato" in that the longer it's in your hands, the more your fingers will get burned. I'd send the e-mail, per the manager's request, and do no more. No more policing! 

Red flag! If they're not testing you, they're not testing your teammates either. Low standards. If you're a strong developer, you may get run ragged trying to bear the weight of a low-standards shop. This actually happened to me. Really, really do your homework on this place. 

You might think of the term "author royalties" and automatically assume that anyone would welcome the opportunity to have an extra check in the mailbox. What if your supervisor, in his private life, is dealing with some mess, like an alimony payment and unwanted court visits? That's a reality for LOTS of people, male and female. And so, your "contribution" to his life could have the effect of creating more noise in his life by way of more court visits, more attorneys, and so forth -- over a few lousy dollars. So if his situation is near-peaceful, and your suggestion threatens to muck that all up again, could you see how it'd be easy to turn some royalties down? I've only given a hypothetical because I don't know the man's private life. As it stands you don't know his private life, either. Don't go assuming that your pot of gold is certain to make the next person happy. If you're feeling guilty, ask him if there's a charity you should donate his share to. Overstepping may have consequences. 

I go stone-cold when I am asked this question by a recruiter. Particularly, one that I don't already have a working relationship with (I've done a lot of shorter contract gigs, and have a 20-year span with consulting firms and their recruiters all over Southern California). If I give that information to these people, they go digging. Some will even say, "who did you work for over there?" They are looking for new business. I am very careful with what I share. If it will benefit someone I've worked with successfully in the past, then I don't mind as much. This doesn't apply with a corporate (in-house) recruiter or HR person. 

This isn't unusual. I've seen places where someone gets hired for a job requiring a computer, but IT doesn't get things settled for weeks and weeks. Find yourself something halfway related to your position to keep busy with. Don't drive yourself nuts. Being idle isn't going to be an issue until you actually receive some assignments. 

Who's paying your way to the show? Are transportation and a hotel required? What capacity are you going to be in during your visit? Are you expected to help the new company, or are you just there to see what they've got going on? How much time are you expected to spend there? Are you expected to dress a certain way? Is this absolutely the last thing you have to do in order to get this job? 

Your behavior of trying to avoid uncomfortable feelings is coming at a high price. You got called to the carpet, and thought your manager was gonna be the virtuous knight in shining armor and rescue you, but that didn't work. Your manager probably knew better than to be adjusting production code, but took a shortcut. By that, there was already a red flag as far as integrity was concerned. So maybe you were expecting too much in the meeting. Now you're still concerned that there's going to be some discomfort, even though you actually did nothing wrong, if you tell the truth. Your manager apparently has a better stance at dealing with negative emotions than do you. You're putting his feelings ahead of your own ability to bring home a paycheck. To save your own tail, you're going to have to get wise, emotionally. Here's where this can go, if things sour: no job, late notices in your mailbox, and an empty refrigerator. Speak up for yourself. 

If the two libraries are technically matched, then find out which one seems to be supported better, and eliminate the other. That's good business. If nothing else, flip a coin, and choose one. Somebody's implementation will stay, and someone's will go. All and all, you can't be afraid to be the bad guy. 

This is one for HR. There is a conflict-of-interest here that is going to affect not only you, but everyone who reports to this manager. From a website I'm viewing on this, for more information: 

Before you open your mouth, consider what the GOAL of doing so is going to be. Venting? Do that with a friend. Changing the organization and how things work? Dude, you're a consultant. You might want to save all the talking for the recruiters you need to get in touch with, because it's likely you'll be reaching out to them soon. You're on a one-man team for a reason you can't change. Be effective where you can, and know where you cannot. 

"I need to take my lunch now." That's all. If questioned, repeat. Don't feel the need to explain yourself. Don't apologize. This is no different than having to take a restroom break. Anyone who doesn't get it, and respect your human needs, is someone you don't need to be working for. 

Forward that email to the top (make sure that person knows why you're sending it), and just stand aside. Watch for falling rocks. 

You need -- for the second part -- language of a "service level agreement". It will go into detail as to what you're on the hook for and what you're not. Don't leave this up to a few words and a handshake. It's all great -- until the event happens, and it's not clear what should be going on. Try this for starters: $URL$ 

If you KNOW that you are benefiting from illegal activity, that makes you an accessory or accomplice (a passive role, but still a role). Forget about trying to save the company - you should really be thinking about saving your own neck. If your company is ever investigated, it may be hard to deny that you know anything about what they do. Should that be the case, friend: you'll be on the hook. Get out while you can.
