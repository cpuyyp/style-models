As a hiring manager, this is what I want to see: *note that I'm taking @Amy's example and trimming it down to the essentials. 

I've personally been in the boss's shoes when we had a slow sales cycle. I gave everyone 30 days notice of when the money would run out and let each of them decide if they wanted to go to the end. The end being the last day I had money to make payroll. Some did, some didn't. In our case, it worked out as we had a few very late paying clients whose checks finally showed up with a couple days left in our "Startup death clock". I would never have asked people to work for free in the hopes of getting a future check. Never mind that it's illegal where I'm at, it's just unethical. So if we wouldn't have finally been paid by a few clients then I would have closed the whole thing down. 

Almost any book, website, tutorial etc on networking will teach you how to join small groups who appear to be having an interesting conversation, and how to politely end a conversation. This terrifies many people but honestly a simple "I'll have to ask you to excuse me, I'm afraid. Enjoy the rest of the party!" works very well and doesn't require you to pretend that your phone is ringing, you need to pee, or you need to refill your drink. Nor do you have to worry that your former conversation-mate will be mad when they see you in another conversation later. Think of these parties as free networking practice. Assuming you don't throw up on the CEO, the stakes are very low. There may come a time in your career when an event like this holds tremendous value for your career. So learn how they work and what skills you need, and go this year and start working on those skills. You will get better every year and starting the first time you go, you'll see a benefit - people will stop asking why you're not going, for example. 

It's impossible to know what you are missing out on unless you decide to go get that experience. Maybe you aren't missing out on anything and maybe you are. I'm trying to think of reasons why past coworkers would tell you that you need to work for a large company. Perhaps you have some expectations or demands that are simply not in line with what a small company can provide. Without knowing you, I can't give that advice. What I can say is that different experiences enhance our perception of life. By working for a large company for a year or two you might gain a bit of insight that will be a big help to you. 

There are thousands of different reasons that small businesses fail. However, there are literally billions of people on this planet that have never even tried. I've been there. Years ago I closed a small business and reentered the regular workforce for a period of time. My reasons where simple: my paycheck had to get back to some type of regularity. I was doing consulting and some months I made a lot of money and others I didn't have a thing to do. This was absolute hell on my personal finances - and family. Anyone that's been in business for awhile knows that you get paid when the clients decide to cut that check. Sometimes clients don't pay, sometimes they pay really really late. If you are the business owner that is a huge personal risk. However, FTE's don't have to deal with that and instead can just focus on their job ... unless they are in accounts receivable. Quite frankly I give preference to hiring people that have tried, and failed, to run a small business than ones that have never even tried. Of course, someone who has tried to run their own business is far more likely to try it again. Which is the spirit that I'm after for mine. The point of all of this is that closing your business is not an indication of true failure on your part and you shouldn't treat it as such during an interview. One possible answer: 

I am aware that these form a contradiction of sorts. If I am irritated at being interrupted, I may refuse to answer in the hope of reducing future interruptions, even though those refusals bother me a lot. But I try not to, because then I am being that person who gives a ten sentence speech about where the information is and how important my time is, instead of just answering the question. People say that answering will just encourage them to ask - that isn't always a bad thing. If your information is not as accessible as it should be, asking reveals that. Resisting the urge to refuse to answer, or answer only with where to find the answer, the more mature approach is: 

One point I haven't seen the other answers mention is that choosing an email address is choosing an identity. What messages do different choices send? 

Focus on asking questions rather than telling your boss what to do or making demands. You have a great opportunity here to learn about your company and to land a solid promotion. I hope it works out well for you. 

Been there, done that. The fact that the boss has already taken a loan and blown through that money indicates that there are no more rabbits to be pulled from the hat. Start looking right now. That aside, you have a choice. Either you spend your days working for free or you just go home. The answer to this depends on whether you believe this guy has the potential of finally paying you. In order to make an educated guess on that you need information. Namely you need to figure out if this is a cash flow problem or a complete dead end. For example: - What invoices are outstanding to be paid to the company? - Who is calling on those clients? - Have they indicated when payment is coming? If there are no outstanding invoices that your clients owe money on OR the clients have not indicated when/if payment is coming then this is a complete dead end. For the boss to just hope for future sales to come in to make payroll is disingenuous at best. Quite frankly (s)he should have known months ago exactly when the money would run out and notified everyone of the impending disaster. If there are outstanding invoices, then you need more detail. - How much is outstanding? - How much are the monthly expenses? - When were the invoices due? If prior to now, why haven't they been paid? - How does the boss intend to cut expenses? - Do the outstanding amounts cover enough of a time frame for the boss to continue paying people or will it only take care of the back bills? If the boss is unwilling to give you all of this information OR the boss needs a "few days" to compile it then just leave. This information should be at a small business owner's finger tips 24x7 and (s)he should be more than willing to share this info with you due to the situation. If the amounts aren't coming in soon or aren't enough to cover 3+ months of expenses, then leave. If the boss has paid himself but not the employees, then leave and let the workforce commission (if you have something like that) sue him. 

In some companies, there is nothing you can do. It will be done by seniority (hire date) within each department or team. But this is not the usual case. The more things you can and are willing to do, the less likely you are to be laid off. Imagine a team that needs to: 

If your preference is a December start date, to the extent you would decline the job if it was only available in September, you don't need to tell them now. You can take a bit of a bet that if you reply to a written offer with another date, they would rather wait 3 months and get you than go through this whole process again to find someone else. If not, well, you had already decided you would decline a September start date. If your preference is not that strong, then bring this up during the third interview. Say something like: 

This is super common. If the university is large and the program has been around for a while, the people who read resumes will be highly familiar with it. For example, like almost everyone I know with an Engineering degree, I actually have a B. A. Sc. (Bachelors of Applied Science.) On my resume/CV (a rare document for me to provide, but I have several versions) I describe my education as: 

I've yet to meet a single person that felt that linkedin endorsements meant anything beyond the effort to click a button. That is to say, they don't mean anything. I've received "endorsements" from people I haven't seen in 10+ years for things that they would obviously have zero knowledge about. Beyond that, I'd say that if the only people that endorse you are those who you have a familial relationship with, then you're likely better off not including any at all. 

There was a tax break for hiring workers who were previously unemployed. $URL$ But I'm fairly certain that expired in 2010. Also, Oklahoma did give state tax breaks for aerospace businesses hiring recent college graduates. If you aren't in that area you might look at your local (state) tax laws - it's possible that something else might apply. More information: $URL$ Bear in mind that that web page is from 2012. You'll want to find something a little more recent. 

Update: about the lawyer.. A company that has 40 employees has enough funds to keep legal on retainer. Presumably this company has already engaged with a decent law firm to handle everything from establishing the corp on up to reviewing the employee handbook as well as reviewing various contracts. So picking up the phone to ask them what to do should be a very inexpensive call. By that I mean less than $1000, depending on legal's hourly rate. That amount of money is trivial to what a botched harassment claim could cost. Further, given the OPs description of the handling, it is apparent that he doesn't have an HR manager or really anyone in a position to give proper guidance on what to do. This isn't something you should just google or ask anonymous people on a website about.
