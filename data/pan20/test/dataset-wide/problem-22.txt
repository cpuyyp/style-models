Broadly, the simplest and quickest way to answer 'What happens if X happens to a human?' Is to simply do X to a human. Does my new treatment for radiation poisoning work? Real world: Let's figure out a way to model this on a cell culture, then test it on animals and make sure it's safe, then finally the next time there's an accident we'll try it. Psycho world: I dunno, let's throw a prisoner into the reactor and find out! Your secret society probably falls into category B. Any experiment to find out what happens with a human in X conditions will fit your needs. 

The same problems that a normal one time pad face would be faced by our hypothetical Caesar. Namely, if you want to send me a message, I need to have: 

The big thing to remember is that transgender people are a minority of a minority - as little as 0.2-0.3% of the population. Contrast being gay, which clocks in at one in ten. Most people in today's age of interconnectivity won't meet even a single transperson, let alone in pre-modern conditions. The most famous western example was the Marquis d'Eon, who effectively blackmailed the King of France into recognising her as a woman, and even she's pretty obscure (though transgenderism did come close to being named Eonism after her). With that in mind even cheating in modern medical knowledge for the setting would make it pretty difficult for transgendered people - even those with significant means to go with their motivation. But not impossible. Synthetic hormones are produced today using soybeans, which could be procured with effort. From there it wouldn't be outside possibility for a skilled chemist to develop a path to synthesise the appropriate hormone - whether for transition or something more pedestrian like menopause. Bearing in mind the combined rarity of the condition, the difficulty in procuring the raw materials (both base and any reagents needed for production), and the need to retain a personal chemist of no small skill, the whole process of transition, while possible, would be difficult in the extreme. Definitely only for wealthy monarchs or high ranking aristocrats. (Surgery? Sink me, no. The only thing you'd get that way, in those conditions, is another victim of infection.) 

Good news, it's not too hard for our friend Tunguska. The magic word is realpolitik Let's get started with her strategic profile. She's not an army - strategically, she's a walking, talking metaphor for the nuclear bomb. If her pet country were reduced to waste in a war, she could still obliterate at least one or two major cities of the offending (super)power before being brought down herself. That nearly automatically* makes her a small nuclear power in her own right, so long as she can protect herself from a first strike. From a realpolitik perspective, that she's in fact a literal fire-breathing dragon means less than her geopolitical value. If she's politically valuable, even the staunchest dracophobe will sing her praises to high heaven and overlook even the deepest flaws. If she's a political foe, she could have spent her time in hiding as Mother Teresa herself and she'd still be a baby-eating monster for whom a swift death is the only appropriate course of action. This provides her with a pathway to sovereign status: by making a deal with, say, Russia (since she was born there) to recognise her sovereignty in exchange for her alliance she can quickly secure her place in the world, while the superpower in question transforms a rogue nuclear weapon into a known (and allied!) quantity. She'd still make enemies, but with superpower backing and personal power a direct move against her would be foolhardy in the extreme. The tricky bit is the fact that Tunguska is also gearing up to get into a war. That may turn her into a liability if she's not careful. Since she's at the same strategic scale as a nuclear weapon, countries will understandably get very very nervous if she starts fighting anyone; it will be very important to make sure the right people know what she's up to, lest she spark a nuclear conflict - or a pre-emptive strike to prevent one. The plus side is that assuming her rival has the same idea (only convincing someone to ally to make dragons quietly go away), there's a good chance the whole dragon war can be kept localised - like other proxy wars geopolitics will keep the big players' hands tied for fear of sparking a more final war, and both Tunguska and her rival will probably be told in no uncertain terms to keep it that way. If her rival doesn't, well, that only means Tunguska has a chance to convince the world that this is something they want to get involved in as a global matter and propaganda herself into a champion of humanity. She'd at least get her own ally onboard - it can't hurt for their dragon to to win that fight. *There's a reasonable case to be made that some countries might declare her a sovereign power unilaterally, simply because diplomats and the army are the most appropriate tools to interact with her. 

There is something that already exists, that if you do not have it, having a lot of intelligence and technology can be tremendous disadvantage. It is wisdom. Possessing a lot of intelligence and/or technology without the wisdom to appropriately apply these things is quite destructive. With intelligence and technology comes new discoveries, new discoveries can be dangerous, especially if misused. Many times, with new discoveries, we only partially understand the situation, and there are hidden dangers that we not realize the danger that they pose until further investigation has been done. We generally posses fair amounts of both in our current culture/society, and thus are quite attuned to discovering and eliminating the ill effects. If you need more motivation, take a look at the early history of X-Rays, $URL$ 

The other answers are great, but tend to focus on luxury items, and items that are valuable because they are scarce at the time. Hand tools, quality made hand tools would be quite valuable. They will be instantly recognizable and testable by most people you are willing to trade with. Additionally, your potential buyers will actually benefit from these items materially (their work will be made easier), and thus may be more willing to trade. These tools, being useful and only slightly different in design than they alread had, will be worn out and discarded or melted down when they reach the end of their life. My particular choices 

High amounts of UV will do it. Single celled organisms would be sterilized, whilst those with a dead skin layer would be relatively fine, though likely subject to higher amounts of mutations and thus skin cancer. You can adjust the dose to keep the whole planet sterile, but perfectly livable for any organism that has developed sunglasses and clothes, and they can grow plants within a greenhouse (if you have dosed your planet with very large amounts of UV continuously). If you need a mechanism to explain the UV, go with high amounts of X-rays hitting an earth type atmosphere, resulting in down-conversion by the atmosphere to UV radiation. If necessary, you can construct the history of your planet so that it develops complex life, that is then killed off by successive gamma ray bursts nearby. $URL$ You will need more than one, of course, because a single gamma ray burst will only effect one side of the planet. Additionally, how sterile do you need it? Your story may be able to function with most complex life killed off, and the only life on the planet are single celled organisms around a deep thermal vent. 

None of these tactics guarantees a kill against a powerful Blood Shaman, but they all present at least a small chance to gain the upper hand against a Shaman. And the Shaman has to win every engagement. We just have to win once. 

One of the points made in a number of recent questions regarding underwater races has prompted me to review one of my older pieces of world-building. Namely: the difficulty of producing common structural materials like steel or concrete in an aquatic environment. I have a species of intelligent, fishlike aliens that live on an ocean world - a world much like ours, only the sea level is high enough to submerge all but the highest peaks. This species is the product of a prolonged uplifting program by a much more advanced civilisation - their technology is by now distantly descended from a wide variety of prefabricated factories introduced to them during the initial uplift. Accordingly the bootstrap problem isn't a big deal, since it can be assumed they acquired any necessary knowledge and equipment from their erstwhile benefactors. Similarly necessary raw materials such as ores can be safely assumed to be present. Technologically they're what we might think of as a contemporary - they're comfortably industrialised and have turned their attentions to spaceships. What components they can't fabricate underwater are produced in aerated industrial complexes built in shallow parts of the world, supported by vast logistical networks. Suitable locations are limited, though, and I'd prefer not to rely on shallow plateaus for all industrial production. In general for this species, air-breathing manufacturing is expensive and inefficient but nevertheless possible - their motivation for moving industry to aquatic manufacture is a matter of efficiency more than for lack of alternatives. What I'm looking for is a structural material that can be produced underwater with little to no reliance on atmospheric gases or access to the surface. Optimally it would be usable in ways comparable to steel, but it should at least be suitable for construction. Typical applications would be shelters/homes (against wildlife and aquatic weather), storage, workplaces, and so on. 

Have you considered folding spikes? Rather than trying to retract them into the body, perhaps instead the spikes fold back against the tail when they're not needed. Properly designed, the spikes can be made much safer folded back than fanned out. Imagine a razor - if you press your finger against the blade it will cut you, but if you stack five together so their blades are flat with each other they barely cut at all. Perhaps your creatures' tails fold back like that. Such powerful spikes also need maintenance- you can't just drop them and regrow like a porcupine. Culturally your creatures might let their tails blunt and only sharpen them for war (an adaptation to denser society). They may also wear clothing over the top to protect their spikes and others. More generally, consider why your creatures evolved such fantastic weapons - there may be arrangements of spikes (eg. forming a blade facing out) that provide utility for its ancient use cases without exposing yourself to too much self-harm.

Geographic/Geometric Jamming can be overcome by directed transmissions (shaped beam radio frequency or laser) with direct line of sight (LOS) to orbiting satellite constellation. Levels appear to involve infiltrating a building, finding a bad guy, then fighting him. Saves are available when you are outside (beginning save point), and at any time that you can re-acquire direct LOS with one of the satellites (middle and pre boss save points). Not every piece of the sky will always have a peek at a satellite, so the lack of a save point near some windows, roofs, docking bays, etc should not be too jarring. The same methodology can be used to explain the sparse save points on an outdoor level depending on the terrain, LOS to ground based repeater stations, and robustness of your satellite constellation. 

This trial is not too different from real trials. It ultimately will become a battle of evidence. Prosecution has evidence suggesting that the perpetrator committed the crime, the defense has evidence suggesting that he couldn't, because he could not physically be present. The strategy at trial from each side will be about convincing the jury that the evidence and story presented by the other side does not represent what actually happened. This is what actually happens in trials in real life. Each side may have what it considers to be definitive proof, but in reality, it comes down to how much weight the jury members attach to each testimony, witness, and exhibit. There was wisdom in the construction of our judicial system that required the convincing of a jury of peers. Outside of the mathematical realm, there exists no objective standard of proof. As such, our system challenges the prosecutor of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal cases, to the jury the details of his case. Each person of the jury has their own internal standards of proof, and it is the goal of the prosecutor to select a favorable jury and then convince them of his case. Alternatively, it is the goal of the defense to also select a favorable jury, and then to obfuscate or disprove the case. I would challenge you to find a type of evidence that is above reproach. Pictures and videos can be faked, witnesses are unreliable and can fall apart under cross examination, and physical evidence can be contaminated, the chain of custody called into question, or the conclusions of the experts challenged. The fact that the potential defendant can manufacture, at the time of the crime, seemingly exonerating evidence gives him a tremendous advantage, but it makes him nowhere near invincible. Jurors can choose to ignore evidence, there may be enough evidence on the prosecutors side that they are convinced "beyond a reasonable doubt" to ignore the exculpatory evidence. Additionally, the jurors may not make decisions that are entirely cerebral. They make make decisions based upon emotions and intuition. It is my estimation that this guy will ultimately get caught. He may be able to buy a few passes with his exculpatory evidence, but if he continues in his life of crime, he will ultimately get stuck. That type of life changes a persons psyche, and most other humans will pick up on those danger queues and intuit the correct decision in opposition to what may be exonerating evidence.
