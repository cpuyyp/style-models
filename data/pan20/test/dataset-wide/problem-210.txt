Your A-type star has a Dyson Swarm of unknown (or known) origin around it. Except the modules are not entirely opaque, but almost transparent, and of a nice shade of blue. 

If they can somehow separate the hydrogen or the helium from their food or enviroment to keep it in special bladders they could gain buoyancy and float out of the water (where they breed) into the air over dry land. If then they can detect a prey right under them and quickly release gas to drop straight down, they can substitute birds of prey in a ecosystem. Sea animals extract oxygen from the water with gills and such, maybe they can keep the H after taking the O2 (I don't know a lot about underwater respiration so ask someone who does before taking the idea into serious account) 

If you have figured out the weight limits you should think of distance. Is the TK able to lift the same weight from 1 meter that from 5 meters away? What about 10 meter? 100? 1 km? Also think of the equilibrium axis: Does the TK grab the object as a whole or from a specific point? because if they lift from the wrong place the whole thing will tip over. 

Once you accept these points, which are broadly accepted by professional scholars of religion (which is very different from "religious scholars" or "theologians"), the question of "designing a religion" changes dramatically. One can hardly give a "right" answer to this, but there are some general guideposts worth considering by way of preliminaries. Religion is universal Any of the various semi-functional definitions of religion references a set of phenomena that appear to exist and have existed among all human societies in all places and times. We do not know of strong counter-examples. This has a number of interesting implications: 

In the history of magical or occult thinking, one finds that things are rarely taken as themselves: they tend to be in relation to other things. When we say "correspondences," this is really what we mean -- a correspondence is properly a relationship between two things that is embedded in a larger system or web of such relationships. Thus object A is like object B because both share property C that is considered to be a quality, aspect, effect, or sign (or all of these) of principle D. As a result, the real question here is about classification. While it is true that Nature herself does not classify Australian and European plants together, that's because Nature herself does not classify anything. We do, as observers, on certain more or less defined or formal bases. For example, we classify some plants as "grasses," and there are complex and serious reasons for doing so, much debated and so forth across the last couple of centuries. Under that system, there are "grasses" in both Europe and Australia. Either those plants are or are not "really" connected in terms of your magical correspondence system, which leads to a deeper matter. It appears, from the description of power level allowing looser correspondences, that correspondence classification is an intersection between the magician-subject and the natural-objective phenomenon. This means that there is some way in which things are or are not "really" linked, at an underlying, natural, non-cultural sort of level. And there is also some way in which that kind of linkage is actually forged, created, signified -- in a word, made -- by the human observing subject. If this is correct, then there is no absolute sense in which two things do or do not correspond: it's a matter of interpretation and knowledge. In which case, to resolve the difficulty within a fantastical world of your creation, you may need to come up with a formal conception of "natural correspondence," i.e., that type of relation that preexists within nature just because, and which is in some fashion a prerequisite for magical manipulation. 

The rainforest people probably noticed that that insects don't approach the leaves of a certain plant, so they would use it to make an oil that they use as repellent. Also, it may sound like a bit "Flinstone" but keeping chameleons or frogs in or around the hut so they eat the mosquitoes is not a far fetched idea. Cats were kept as pets because they hunted down the vermin. 

Irresponsibility. A group of ancient aliens, evolved from mammal-like, ape-like animals, traverses the universe stopping here and there, going down to the surface without any care of how they might affect the ecosystem. In some planets they see lizard-like creatures predating on mammal-like furry critters, and since they find them cuter that the reptiles they scare away the predators, giving mammals an evolutionary leg up via butterfly effect. In other planets they find ape-man like beings and they interact with them, again without a second thought to how the affect them, which is by leaving the impression of incredibly powerful beings that would affect how they chose mate in the following generations, with the individuals that resemble them, with their walking on two legs and wide foreheads, being considered the best mates. So... Irresponsable aliens. 

A parallel timeline is, in essence, a universe, so you have to destroy a whole universe by, for example, speeding up the big crunch or eliminating one of the four essential forces, like the Atomic Strong Force or the Gravity, in the whole universe. Don't ask me how. 

Does each corner begin or end something? (Begin and end are of course chronologically the same, but they are conceptually quite different.) At what point does the Zodiac begin? (Since the Mesopotamians, it begins at the vernal equinox, but you can pick any corner.) 

There are a number of preconceptions that need to be cleared away in order to get at a useful answer. 

An alternative approach could hinge on anti-Catholic sentiment, plus a dash of anti-Semitism. One classic objection to women in the priesthood comes from an early exegesis of a Levitican definition, which says that priests must be physically perfect. That is, no deformities, including also certain skin diseases conceived as equivalent to leprosy. In the exegetical text, they enumerate all the minimum criteria of wholeness, including "two fully-descended testicles." Women don't have those, so no woman priests, QED. Now if you spin this as typical Roman Catholic superstitious nonsense, based on Jewish nonsense, you could elevate a woman to the priesthood in England around the time of universal suffrage. From there, you just need a bio of a truly extraordinary woman who rose during the War and became Archbishop around the time Elizabeth was crowned. 

In other words, there is a determinate connection between the spell and the obscure, postulated power that will in turn generate the actual effect, again deterministically. Unfortunately, each spell’s performance depends on a range of variables, and when very small changes are made they produce wildly variable results. Since each magician must to a great extent find his own way of manipulating mana, this means that two magicians can produce very much the same results without their methods apparently overlapping much at all. Second, we can invert the problem by lodging magic beyond the outer limit of scientific knowledge. I don’t mean that it’s unknowable, only that, as several distinguished anthropologists have argued, magic postulates unlimited determinism. The classic example comes from Evans-Pritchard’s study of Zande witchcraft and sorcery. To simplify, here we have Uncle Herman, sitting having a snooze beside the old granary. A high wind comes up, the granary falls over, and Herman dies. Explain. 

I am not sure if you are asking which one is more plausible or wich one would be a better setting for a world you are building. You would have to specify what are you looking for. In general terms I would always recommend the tunnel network. if you look at the Underdark in Dungeons and Dragons or the cyber-labyrinth in Tsutomu Nihei's "Blame" series. A tunnel system can hold any number of ambients, from claustrophobic passages to caverns so wide you can't see the wall on the other side. Hosting entire cultures of peoples that could be as primitive and isolated or advanced and networked as you want. On the other hand Hollow Earth does not really differ so much from the surface, other that you can spy on the other side of the world with a good enough telescope. But mountains and seas should not be that different, and you have to explain how the gravity works and where does the sunlight come from. My vote is for Tunnel Network. 

Rent it to whiskey makers. They can age the barrels artificially and find out what is the true optimal age of a whiskey. 40 years, 60 years, 100 years? Finally the liquor enthusiasts will find out at what point it stops getting better, or even if it does... 

The gods have abandoned us because we failed to act in a manner they approved. We must return to the old ways, obey every jot and tittle of the old law, and then the gods will come back. The gods were never really there anyway: they were a fantasy of superstitious rubes. Now we can see clearly that there are no gods, so we should get on with making the world a good place for us. The gods disappeared for reasons we cannot fathom, because we don't have enough information. We need to keep faith and watch for the signs of their return. 

This question has attracted many replies, but few answers. I’ll make a stab at the latter. Let’s be clear on the question: Given: 

The classic mythological model here is what Mircea Eliade and others called a deus otiosus. In essence, this is a god who has removed himself from the everyday lives and ritual practices of his worshipers. In terms of religion and myth, the pattern -- well attested in east Africa, the ancient Near East, and sporadically elsewhere -- tends to involve a senior creator-god, an "all-father" like Odin or Zeus, plus a pantheon of lesser divinities with relatively particular areas of interest and influence. The creator creates the world and all in it, sometimes with help of the others, and sometimes simply by creating those lesser divinities as helpers -- or both. Having done this work, the creator essentially lays down the rules for how humanity should relate to each other and to the gods... and then goes back to wherever he actually lives (the sky, the mountaintop, etc.). From the worshippers' point of view, this means that ritual life is divided into practices that address lesser gods within their spheres of interest. Thus women seeking help with childbirth or pregnancy, or men seeking help with hunting, address their prayers and rites to the goddess of fertility or the god of the hunt, respectively. On certain unusual occasions, principally annual rites of especially awesome dimensions, the senior priesthood (or sometimes an otherwise "secret" priesthood) addresses collective sacrifices to the creator, more or less thanking him for all he has done to make life possible and ordered, for creating the lesser gods, and so forth. Every now and then, however, really bad things happen, such as a long-extended drought, or a plague, or something like that. The prayers addressed to the lesser gods don't seem to be solving the problem. At this point, the senior priests and the community at large come out to beg for the intercession of the creator. Think of it like a bureaucracy: you don't go to the CEO when your computer doesn't work, you call IT; when the whole company is collapsing, it's the CEO who is (supposed to be) responsible. Now the question here simply reverses the perspective on this not-uncommon pattern, asking why the gods behave in this fashion. In addition, it posits that all the gods have receded, not just the creator. To address this, I would begin with the previously-described deus otiosus pattern, and think about the stories people tell. The question isn't why gods actually do this or that, but rather what people say about such matters. Even in a fantasy world where the gods may manifest directly, they're not especially likely to explain themselves. Why should they? What I think is lacking from the question is consideration that there may be fundamental disagreement about the gods' actions. If we take the situation you've described, I can see various cults that account for the situation differently: 

If i were you i would send my own drone down to the surface and communicate through that, that way they would know for sure they are not being punked by a pirate radio signal and a kid with Mad FX Skills. Let the humans decide who steps in front of the drone. 

Maybe this is how the aliens evolve themselves. They discover new organisms, the hybridised some individuals, and they keep them in their "society" for a trial period of time. They can observe then if this additions bring any benefits to the collective or they just eliminate the individuals and move along to another species. Maybe make so humans are not the only species on earth they have hybrids of. 

Mesothermics. Contrary to believe, cocroaches would not survive a nuclear winter, but not because of the radiation, but because of the cold. A global nuclear winter would see the appearance of endothermic characteristics in animal that use to be exothermic. Sadly this would mean that lizards and insects would be much more voracious. But the ability to lower the metabolism when there is little food or a creature finds itself in a warmer place could also be crucial. So many creatures could appear with the capacity to generate just enough internal heat to survive eficiently. 

The wheel is not necessarily an automatic development for humans. Classical Mesoamerica (Mayans, Aztecs/Mixica, etc.) didn't have the wheel. At base, the issue there was a combination of lots of dense forest and jungle, on the one hand, and a lack of large domestic animals on the other. So things like carts just didn't really click, as it were. So in direct answer to your question, you can have it either way, as you choose. There's no necessity about it. If everyone can fly, they might find wheels useful anyway for cartage and so forth, but on the other hand, they might not. 

A coarse network of steel cable is wrapped around the upper hull of a ship, running from the gunwales to the waterline, and is attached to the copper plating. Given some warning, an expert magician hidden away in the orlop can activate this network to absorb large, sudden bursts of energy—including, most particularly, bursts caused by the impact of cannon-fire. The energy is dissipated, not especially efficiently, as heat, radiating through the copper plating, where it heats the water under the ship. Thus this cable “armor” relies on the ocean to act as a huge heat-sink. 

A world I am developing requires that only approximately one quadrasphere or quadrant (1/2 a hemisphere) of the planet be occupied. I would like the north and south extremes to be outside anything resembling human comfort—far hotter or colder than the daytime Sahara or nighttime South Pole, for instance. There is therefore a single temperate zone, centered somewhere between the pole and the equator, only half of which (divided longitudinally) is habitable. I don’t have strong opinions about why you can’t go east or west, but it’s a very real barrier, not a misconception or the like. Total area should ideally be somewhat larger than a quadrant of Earth, but this is a very minor factor if it’s a problem. Much of the center of the quadrant is taken up by a great sea, such that the large inhabited landmasses extend from the sea out toward the “edge.” My first thought was to do this with axial tilt, eccentric orbits, things like that. But I realized I simply don’t know nearly enough about such topics as climate science, planetary physics, and so on. To boil it down: 

Tube worms are best at detecting micro wormholes near them, and what is on the other side. When they detect something they want, they extend a tendril that stabilises the wormhole, follow by the main body that expands the tunnel, so they can capture what is on the other size and bring it to home to eat or feed their colony. 

A town or village may invest a lot of money in making a priest of high repute or known skill to come and bless a piece of land, to make it Hallow Ground, a place where necromancy doesn't work, and have sentinels patrol this cemetery the same as any other part of town. There would be also a lot of common knowledge mixed with myth about what makes a body easier for a necromancer to raise it and people would take that into account. Maybe they would bury them with stakes across their hearts, or extract the brain and organs like Egyptian mummies... 

If you only have one small sentient individual per big organism then the small ones would evolve adapting their life cycles to the big ones, which means they would not herd in big numbers or mate often. Maybe the big ones can produce very big litters but the small ones not so much, which would mean that there won't be as many small ones and lesser generational change than with humans. That would make their evolution slower. Also an individual protected by a big organism wouldn't need to develop ingenuity as much as humans did to avoid predators and find food. I'd say the odds are slim.
