Yes, there are similarity relations where one can describe a common factor that underlies the similarity. A mother and a daughter may share same eye colors, nose shapes, etc (the analogy in the bbc episode seems indeed faulty). Wittgenstein's claim seems to be that the picturing relation is just not one of these relations. There is no describable common factor to that similarly. To inquire why this might be, let's take an example. How does the sentence 

I will focus here on the first part of the question, which pertains to Putnam's argument to the effect that "meanings ain't in the head". I take this (rather than functionalism) to be the main issue. 

Yes, there are philosophical possibilities to deny that language necessitates ontological commitments. The presumption that language does necessitates ontological commitments is an invention of 20th century analytic philosophy, and it is highly contentious there too. Arguing from language was ridiculed by philosophers throughout history. Here, for example, is how Socrates summarizes Plato's dialogue Cratylus, the only dialogue of Plato that centered on language: 

Concerning the other question, I'm not aware that anyone argued that the Tractatus implies that the world of facts cannot also be spoken about. Many have suggested the opposite, i.e. that the Tractatus itself shows that more can be spoken about than is supposed. Thus Bertrand Russell, in his Introduction to the Tractatus: 

Well, I would argue you are 'picking' on capitalism. The more neutral axiom to argue is that 'Civilization' is a dying process of intelligent life. Under that proposition if you are able to escape earth bound institutional society humanity has as a slight chance to avoid the inevitable. PS, it has never been (can not be) proven that Civilizations do not end, and never gracefully. 

I read some arguments in this forum about Western vs Eastern viewpoints. And about the idea that modern-Western thought applies Science principles and eastern, being older merely applies a more rudimentary logic, or so implied. This 'judgment' goes along with the idea that the purpose of Philosophers is to ferret out truth. I would want to argue that that isn't the only purpose, that ferreting out is just a tactic to resolve subjects. I would say a large purpose to it is knowing how to live. I'm suggesting that Philosophy still retains a purpose that created it, answering the question, "How best to live in a world were much of it is unknowable?" In this case I see the pursuit as one where you muddle through the best you can, with what you do know, including the tactic of Science, Logic, investigation and testing. But if the Eastern and the Am-Orient way of the shaman is, "Let's just dance" and see what pops up, I see some useful philosophic, if a bit archaic wisdom in that too. It does answer the question, "How do I live though this?" The problem with our modern approach is that western thought tends to diminish the value of methods navigating the unknowable and focus only on the known, or deriving the known. Any basis of touchy-feely, fuzzy logic for example would tend to be disrespected. I see Philosophy as a part of wisdom, not the other way around. What else, what other sources of wisdom do we ignore, restricting ourselves to modern thinking? Am I all wet, or does any of that makes sense? 

The Consolation of Philosophy is a classic book, written by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius in the 6th century AD. Boethius lived in the time of the fall of Rome. He was both an important philosopher (among other things, he began the project of translating Aristotle's works to Latin) and a high official, both in Rome and with its Ostrogoth conquerers. But due to some unfortunate occasion, he became suspected as a spy for Byzantine. He was arrested, imprisoned, and later executed. It was during his imprisonment, that Boetius wrote The Consolation of Philosophy. This lovely little book is written in alternating prose and verse. It tells that, in his prison cell, Philosophy itself, in the image of a goddess, is revealed to Boethius. She reprimands him for his melancholy. Step by step, she reminds him of his philosophical teachings (Socratic and Platonic, mostly), and about what they entail about the real meaning and value in life. And thus, according to the book, Boethius is gradually letting go of his melancholy, and attains happiness in the midst of his misfortune. The Consolation of Philosophy is said to have been widely read throughout the middle ages and the Renaissance. For some reason, it became less known later. Boethius himself was a christian, but his book is neither christian nor religious, but purely philosophical. A taste of Boethius's philosophical verse (translated to English by H.R. James): 

"The whole controversy is, however, meaningless when applied to praxeology. It refers essentially to geometry. Its present state, especially its treatment by logical positivism, has been deeply influenced by the shock that Western philosophy received from the discovery of non-Euclidian geometries. Before Bolyai and Lobachevsky, geometry was, in the eyes of the philosophers, the paragon of perfect science; it was assumed that it provided unshakable certainty forever and for everybody. To proceed also in other branches of knowledge more geometrico was the great ideal of truth-seekers. All traditional epistemological concepts began to totter when the attempts to construct non-Euclidian geometries succeeded. Yet praxeology is not geometry. It is the worst of all superstitions to assume that the epistemological characteristics of one branch of knowledge must necessarily be applicable to any other branch. In dealing with the epistemology of the sciences of human action, one must not take one’s cue from geometry, mechanics, or any other science. The assumptions of Euclid were once considered as self-evidently true. Present-day epistemology looks upon them as freely chosen postulates, the starting point of a hypothetical chain of reasoning. Whatever this may mean, it has no reference at all to the problems of praxeology. The starting point of praxeology is a self-evident truth, the cognition of action, that is, the cognition of the fact that there is such a thing as consciously aiming at ends. There is no use cavilling about these words by referring to philosophical problems that have no bearing upon our problem. The truth of this cognition is as self-evident and as indispensable for the human mind as is the distinction between A and non-A.” — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.5 

Socrates demanded of wisdom more than the ability to reason. He demanded a clear knowledge of first principles, especially in the form of possessing well tested definitions of basic concepts. For example, in Plato's dialogue Laches, a discussion starts between Socrates and two Athenian army generals, Laches and Nicias, concerning the question how to nurture courage in young people. The two generals turn out to have opposite opinions, and they cannot find a common ground. Then Socrates, in a typical move, steers the discussion in the direction of definitions: what is  courage? 

I think that "consist" expresses actually just the identity relation in disguise. For example, saying "being human consists in being a rational animal" is equivalent to the equality "being human = being a rational animal" or "humanity = rationality + animality". The "consist" word is used in the context of locating the relevant property among other properties. For example, one considers many particular human beings. Some are short, some tall, some bald, some hairy, etc. And one wonders, where is the humanity in all these humans? And then one is told: "being human consists in being a rational animal". Then one knows better where to look, what to focus on, how to isolate the humanity within the multiplicity of human beings and their many properties. 

Sure. None have been successful though. 1 He who wants to attack a praxeological theorem has to trace it back, step by step, until he reaches a point in which, in the chain of reasoning that resulted in the theorem concerned, a logical error can be unmasked. But if this regressive process of deduction ends at the category of action without having discovered a vicious link in the chain of reasoning, the theorem is fully confirmed. Those positivists who reject such a theorem without having subjected it to this examination are no less foolish than those seventeenth-century astronomers were who refused to look through the telescope that would have shown them that Galileo was right and they were wrong. — Ludwig von Mises, Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, p.70 2 "The essence of logical positivism is to deny the cognitive value of a priori knowledge by pointing out that all a priori propositions are merely analytic. They do not provide new information, but are merely verbal or tautological, asserting what has already been implied in the definitions and premises. Only experience can lead to synthetic propositions. There is an obvious objection against this doctrine, viz., that this proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is in itself —as the present writer thinks, false— a synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience." — Ludwig von Mises, The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science, pg. 5 3 “The attempt to disprove the action-axiom would itself be an action aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding other courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting the actor to the possibility of achieving or not achieving the desired goal and so leading to a profit or a loss. And the very possession of such knowledge then can never be disputed, and the validity of these concepts can never be falsified by any contingent experience, for disputing or falsifying anything would already have presupposed their very existence. As a matter of fact, a situation in which these categories of action would cease to have a real existence could itself never be observed, for making an observation, too, is an action.” — Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method 

Oh, this depends on what you define as 'better. And that is a short term as well as a long term result. Is higher quality, quantity or variety important to you? Or is it aspects of personality like more moral, experienced or analytical? And is it internal or external. Then there is reward, when you get more of that is that 'better'? Just because there is more external collateral effect, that doesn't speak necessarily speak of a change to the human itself. Best I would say, technology enhancement benefits in difference to all other behavior only within the scope of the technology. As far as the human is concerned it's the behavior of the person that generates an effect not the technology itself. So yes, externally the human is different, he can now go to the moon, but did that fact change the human itself? When he looked back at the earth having an epiphany , he was changed, but could something else have provided an equal effect? I think you can document that having cheap radios has had the effect people do not commonly need to know how to make their own. Net gain? -1 externally. Are these better or worse people? 0 change internally. Was that a permanent change to humanity? 

That is, Anaxagoras' theory of "mind" related to such matters as whether the earth is flat or round, whether the earth was in the centre of the universe, and as to the movement (and lack thereof) of the sun, the moon and the stars. Therefore it is plain that Anaxagoras' "mind" was not merely the human one. As Socrates related further, he was disappointed with Anaxagoras' theory. The mind was supposed to be the source of order in the universe. But it turned out that Anaxagoras' cosmic "mind" was quasi- mechanical, and not sovereign, in the sense that it did not order things according to what it considered to be the best manner. Socrates did not know, of course, the neoplatonists, but he would apparently be more content with their version of cosmic mind (nous) than with that of Anaxagoras'. (Edit - some elaboration: Anaxagoras' nous is performing tasks, like rotating and separating the other cosmic elements. Socrates, as reported in the Phaedo, did not consider those tasks directed at what was overall best. The neo-Platonists, on the other hand, followed Plato in depicting the cosmic nous as aiming at the best. Plato placed the Form of the good above all the other eternal Forms, signalling that the Forms represented what was overall best. The neoplatonists placed the cosmic Nous under the cosmic One, which they identified with the platonic Good.) 

It is unnecessary. Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics by Murray N. Rothbard ...Moreover, even if verbal economics could be successfully translated into mathematical symbols and then translated into English so as to explain the conclusions, the process makes no sense and violates the great scientific principle of Occam’s Razor: avoiding unnecessary multiplication of entities… ...Although himself a mathematical economist, the mathematician son of Carl Menger wrote a trenchant critique of the idea that mathematical presentation in economics is necessarily more precise than ordinary language: Consider, for example, the statements (2) To a higher price of a good, there corresponds a lower (or at any rate not a higher) demand. (2') If p denotes the price of, and q the demand for, a good, then q = f(p) and dq/dp = f' (p) ≤ 0 Those who regard the formula (2') as more precise or "more mathematical" than the sentence (2) are under a complete misapprehension … the only difference between (2) and (2') is this: since (2') is limited to functions which are differentiable and whose graphs, therefore, have tangents (which from an economic point of view are not more plausible than curvature), the sentence (2) is more general, but it is by no means less precise: it is of the same mathematical precision as (2'). Mathematics versus Economic Logic by Ludwig von Mises ...The deliberations which result in the formulation of an equation are necessarily of a nonmathematical character. The formulation of the equation is the consummation of our knowledge; it does not directly enlarge our knowledge. […] No such constant relations exist, however, between economic elements. The equations formulated by mathematical economics remain a useless piece of mental gymnastics and would remain so even it they were to express much more than they really do. ...The mathematical method is at a loss to show how, from a state of nonequilibrium, those actions spring up which tend toward the establishment of equilibrium. It is, of course, possible to indicate the mathematical operations required for the transformation of the mathematical description of a definite state of nonequilibrium into the mathematical description of the state of equilibrium. But these mathematical operations by no means describe the market process actuated by the discrepancies in the price structure. The differential equations of mechanics are supposed to describe precisely the motions concerned at any instant of the time traveled through. The economic equations have no reference whatever to conditions as they really are in each instant of the time interval between the state of nonequilibrium and that of equilibrium. Only those entirely blinded by the prepossession that economics must be a pale replica of mechanics will underrate the weight of this objection. A very imperfect and superficial metaphor is not a substitute for the services rendered by logical economics...
