This is a false dichotomy; into which category would you place moral fictionalism? To me, it seems to require an independent one. 

The first could be taken as a biological question or a religious one. The second might refer to counterfactual scenarios, to a question regarding the extent of human agency, or perhaps to an inquiry into the question of why a person makes one set of decisions rather than another (if the latter is true, then it's likely a psychological question). The danger I see is attempting to answer a biological, psychological, or religious question in a manner that is uniquely philosophical. Of course, that's not always an easy boundary to discern, but it often amounts to a person conducting some ill-formed study of life (for example) from the armchair. I don't think anyone will get very far if he intends to gather knowledge of mitochondrial DNA or the history of the cosmos by means of pure speculation. I assume that many immersed in the philosophical tradition would classify topics such as counterfactuals and human agency (especially if the latter amounts to a question of freedom of will) as being properly philosophical. David Lewis and Saul Kripke (contemporary professors of philosophy) wrote quite a bit about counterfactuals, and countless philosophers had something to say about the determinism debate (Hume in the 18th Century, and Mark Balaguer this century). Additionally, if your question is related not just to agency in terms of outward action but also to freedom of belief (doxastic voluntarism), many others have commented on the topic: Dion Scott-Kakures, William Alston, and Robert Audi come to mind. Final note: Philosophy does not ask questions, people do. However, I understood what you meant. 

Think about this for a second. What kind of evidence are you expecting the atheist to have? Let's find an example of a successful negative existential in order to see if your expectations are reasonable. Surely, the claim "There are no plastic figurines filled with lemon juice on my front lawn" can be verified. But this claim differs from the claim in question ("God does not exist") because it carves out some domain to be investigated (my front lawn). If we extend that domain to include the known and unknown universe, along with any neighboring dimension that a deity might inhabit, you'll see that a problem arises: failing to come across such a figurine does not mean that it doesn't exist, because it might simply be somewhere we haven't looked. But even after modifying our example claim to render it "unrestricted", it still differs from the atheist's claim: our plastic figurine is material while God is immaterial (or so I've heard). Until we've pinpointed a way to verify this type of negative existential (one that 1. makes no reference to "where" and 2. concerns an immaterial object), then we have no reason to think the atheist can do what you've asked him to do. In other words, if this type of thing is possible, please provide an example. I have no idea how other atheists operate, but my own atheism is based on the fact that I perceive all of the theoretical and "empirical" arguments for God's existence to be unsuccessful and all accounts of revelation/miracles to be unreliable. Additionally, I feel no "God-shaped hole" in my life, I'm not convinced that another life follows this one, and practical arguments (e.g. Pascal, Kant) are unconvincing. If someone asserts that they know that God does not exist, they're being dramatic. In a situation like this, you should attribute this emphatic rhetoric to the person's personality rather than to "atheism" itself. A feeling of certainty plays no critical role in atheism just as it plays no critical role in theism. On a slightly unrelated note, you might want to practice making your questions appear more genuine. If your "question" is really just cathartic venting and if you leave comments such as 

I think this is a strict programming scenario where "True" is treated as a variable, and not in any philosophical way. For example in VBA "True" is equivalent to -1, while False is equivalent to 0. Other programming languages define "True" as 1. If that is the case with Python, it follows that 1 + 1 > 1. In Philosophy, True + True = True because Truth is not a divisible value. 

Thomas Jefferson disagrees with the OP criticism; "the notion of human rights is imaginary and reducible to absurdity (that humans by virtue of being born are magically entitled to certain things)... [and] that human rights are a human invention" Jefferson argues in the Declaration of Independence, that human rights are unalienable which is understood a priori by all individuals in society. 

The movement towards the disapproval of discrimination is not equivalent to the elimination of differentiation. The distinction between treating everyone fairly and treating everyone the same is an important one to recognize. The key take away from the change you are describing, is the elimination of bias (or the elimination of devaluing "the other"). Issues of a polemic and orthodox application of egalitarian distribution are apparent in strict institutionalized socialism or Communism. As John Locke and Thomas Hobbs describe, society is formed on the basis of a tacit agreement between individual to create security for the individual and create opportunity through collective efforts and mutual exchange. Oppositely, Marx describes a socialist society, where these roles are reversed - Individuals serve the needs of the community united by a collective struggle. One of the largest issues with the socialist perspective is that we are not all equivalent, with the same needs, motives, or abilities. It neglects the human intuitions of being individuals first and members of a community second. Historically, the strict application of communism - though rarely expressed in a true adherence to its own values - has resulted in a stifled society. I refer to the collapse of the USSR as a result of rationing and social issues stemming from limitation on individuality. Another example is the collapse of many kibbutzim - the local level socialist communities of Israel. These groups' struggle to maintain a commitment to equality for all, has resulted in greatly diminished participation. Conversely, the competitive nature of the free market and individualism has resulted in higher incentives and greater rewards for both individuals and society. Intrinsically, scarcity requires differentiation because it cannot provide enough to satisfy everyone. Up until society reaches a point of unlimited abundance - where the maximum of each individual's needs are met by the sheer volume of resources, a healthy understanding of differentiation is important. However, it is equally important to show respect and preserve each individual's dignity by not devaluing them based on differences. Instead, it is important to provide fair opportunity until then. 

It may be dense, and discussion is usually a very productive tool is engaging philosophy, but here are some good references that may help start you out. Immanuel Kant begins transcendentalism which may be argued is a precursor to existentialism. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel discusses Idealism and addresses the subject and object dualism. This sets the foundation for existentialism Fredrick Nietzsche discussed Nihilism, and Determinism. David Hume discusses human nature, which can related to engaging your determinism views Martin Heidegger also discusses human nature from an alternative perspective. I will try and revisit when I have some time to list some specific references for you. 

Is there a reason why death could be final? Is there some law that prevents something from ever existing again after it is dead? Why are there supposedly entities that are able to cease existing and never exist again? 

The anthropic principle states that universes must be observed to be compatible with the sapient life that observes it. Thus, only universes containing sapient life will be observed. Is this equivalent to the theory of immortality? 

It's called a social construct or social script. It's something that people do to show their conformity to other people. 

It's a matter of amount and quality of conscious experience. The simulation may have some degree of sentience, but it may be many orders of magnitude lower than what humans are able to achieve. Fundamentally, any claim about consciousness is untestable, and it is a moot point. But it is theoretically possible to imitate human qualia so exactly in a computer that an outside observer cannot tell the difference. The example you gave is just a very minor step in this direction. 

Obviously yes because 0.999... = 1, and geometry can be used to show that this extends to shapes. However, you seem to be asking about eternalism, which is a different question. Furthermore, you seem to imply that time can have a shape. I think modern physics makes it quite clear that the universe is cyclical, conformal, and eternally recurring but for your question it depends on what you mean by the shape of time. 

Can Fascism be derived from first principles? Satya Devi speculated that this was possible. I can define Fascism per the Oxford Encyclopedia. 

Postmodernism is a response to modernism with less optimism about human progress. Both modernism and postmodernism hold that the previous philosophies are obsolete, and they rebel against classical culture through abstract and postmodern art. The difference is that modernism is optimistic about humans' ability to achieve progress while postmodernists hold all value as relative and do not necessarily believe in progress. 

He is contrasting axiomatic, positivist thinking with empiricist, scientific thinking. Science is anti-rational in the sense that it rejects pure reason as a means of understanding the world. Science uses empirical evidence based on unprovable assumptions such as the accuracy of the measuring apparatus. Furthermore, climatology, evolutionary biology, and most of what is called "science" today completely rejects axiomatic reasoning and instead substitutes graphs of vector auto regression models developed by grad students at 2 in the morning using Matlab as the fundamental means of understanding natural phenomena. 

Yes. This is the core of the currently accepted paradigm in cosmology: Conformal Cyclical Cosmology, or CCC. $URL$ The anthropic principle is, in fact, meaningless without the assumption that an observer must always exist. This is proven axiomatically in CCC. CCC also has empirical predictions, which have been confirmed, but those are just in addition to its formal proof. The mathematics behind the proof are too lengthy to post here. However, CCC can be understood simply as the idea that the universe must always exist and contain information, except at the instant before and after heat death, when the universe's information content approaches that of a singularity and the cycle restarts. Only the portions of time containing life will be observed, per the anthropic principle, they will repeat endlessly. This seems to have been taken as self evident by premodern civilizations, while the formal proof of it is fairly recent (2007).
