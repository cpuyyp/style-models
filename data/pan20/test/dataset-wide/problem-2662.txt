The origin of the phrase "not as a person with all the value that we associate with persons" is a modification of an idea found in Kant. For Kant, persons have worth not price. For him, the difference is that things that have a price can be compared with other things that have a price, and we make a selection as to what we buy or sell. Things that have worth, on the other hand, are valuable regardless of any usefulness they have. In fact, for Kant, we should always be willing to sacrifice things that have a price for things that have worth. Given this basic background, it's clear that the choice of the word "value" here can be misleadingly ambiguous. It is not value that we evaluate but rather value that follows from personhood. Thus, regardless of what the individual does, is doing, or has done, on the Kantian picture, they remain persons of worth which obligates us to treat them in certain ways. It then follows that torture (at least on most readings of what torture is) is something that undermines the worth/value of persons. It does not matter if they are a child molester or murderer or saint, they still get the same worth that is associated with being a person. 

Here, ∀x = for any x, T = travels in time, ◻ = necessity, Cx = changes the past. which seems to also be valid (at least on the inference rules I can think of). But again, the same problem arises with respect to soundness. 

Translated a bit, this means that you can never make yourself or anyone a mere tool to an end. (The mere is important but not particularly for your question). Killing yourself is for Kant in the Foundation always wrong, because you are ending rationality for something else -- and ending it absolutely. Moving to MPV, Kant has a bit more to say about killing yourself and whether suicide is wrong. The basic framework remains, but Kant does seem to find exceptions for bravely dying for your country and such things.' BUT it's doubtful Kant would extend that to the example you give. There's two related reasons for this: 

There's an important but confusing distinction that is the key to unlocking part of this apparent mystery. Namely, we need to be very careful about what we mean by "consequentialist justifications." This phrase (taken outside of any context) is ambiguous between: 

Maybe, it's easier just to describe when a Utilitarian could easily say doing the research is okay or not. Example #1 - It's fine utilitarianism. If you're trying to maximize pleasure and don't value consent at all, then you are in the clear as long as the research is likely to increase pleasure for the most in the long run. Example #2 - It's never going to be fine utilitarianism. If you're trying to maximize human freedom and have a harm principle about violations, then even if the research would lead to gains in human freedom, then you cannot pursue it because your species of utilitarianism does not permit this form of harm. For most other cases, we're back to the questions I've outlined above. 

Given that this is the basic road map, sense certainty is the antithesis of this, because (in the formulation Hegel gives it the first time it comes up) it lacks any sense of itself as conscious and is barely even a claim to knowledge. At its most primitive, it's the idea that knowledge is just out there waiting to be perceived. It then has to differentiate itself into ideas about the permanence of the world and the existence and truth of things that we don't see. All of this propaedeutic to any thought of a knower or any more elaborate system of knowledge. Thus, Hegel uses this as the start of his project about Spirit. 

Parmenides rejects a principle of change for existing things. He thinks they are always what they are and thus rejects B. 

One of the key features when teaching the Apology (which many philosophers don't teach in intro courses, because it's somewhat sparse on arguments) is basically whether Socrates is defending himself in full earnest or toying (perhaps trolling) the Athenians who are putting him on trial. There are several features of this toying: 

I can't really answer your question definitively being neither a deep expert in stoicism nor in Peterson's thought (I've done one graduate course on hellenistic philosophy and I've seen some of Peterson's youtube stuff), but given those caveats I will give it a shot. I would suggest that the two aren't that similar. First, it helps to understand what stoicism believes and not merely how people imagine stoics to be (perhaps there's quite a bit of slippage here between "stoicism" and the historical philosophical body of thought Stoicism). It's not a philosophy of self-help per se but rather a theory about the nature of the universe, determinism, and our place in it. Specifically, it holds that all things are causally determined and unchangeable -- the only things we can control our responses to the world we are in. Stoicism is also a theory about happiness -- specifically, it maintains that happiness is the use of reason. i.e. to respond to all things virtuously and with ataraxia (without worry). Differing from Aristotle, the stoics (see for instance Marcus Aurelius) believed that external accoutrements are not necessary for happiness -- only virtue is. And only our vices causes us harm. Stoicism was one of several competing "philosophies" where philosophy here differs somewhat from the contemporary style and is a type of "life philosophy" and set of religious (or quasi-religious) practices. In contrast, Peterson appears to be advocating something built on Jungian archetypes and contemporary psychological studies and methods. The Jungian bit is that there's an arc of experiences you need to undergo in order to achieve a good life or happiness (struggle with darkness and overcome or something like that) plus data-based claims about how people should organize their life for good outcomes. In this sense, it's also a type of life philosophy (or as one commenter derisively puts its "self-help.") I'm sure there's some superficial overlap in that nearly all life-philosophies would give some of the same advice. E.g., "do something meaningful" is advice that just about anyone would agree to -- until we decide what "meaningful" means. tl;dr - both are approaches and theories about what you need to live a good life. Beyond that, they don't seem to have much in common. 

Version 1 just hides the objection; version 2 states it. And as we carve out more and more specific modifications to the values we use for our equation, adding asymptotes etc., it becomes no more efficient or useful to think in utilitarian terms than to think in the terms more natural to the other theories. 

It's nearly impossible to decipher Hegel even with that sort of background without a teacher. While I think knowledge of Kant and Spinoza is helpful, you should also be read up on your Plato and Aristotle. I would recommend reading some secondary literature alongside it. I recommend Lauer's Hegel's idea of philosophy and Frederick Baser's Hegel. I would not recommend Kojeve, Sartre, Marx, or any other hyper famous philosopher's work on Hegel as an interpretive aid. They usually have their own strong agenda as to what they are doing with it. 

To give an analogy, in the game of chess, the words "King", "Queen", "Rook" / "Castle", "Bishop", "Knight" / "Horsey", and "Pawn" are used. Presumably, at some point, there was some sort of connection between these words and their real world analogues. But whatever that connection is, knowing about real world queens does not enable us to intuit anything about the piece called "Queen" and knowing about the piece called "Queen" doesn't give us intuitions about real world queens. Or to give a different analogy, the words in logic and the words in English are semi-"false friends." For example, the word "Gift" in English means a present you give someone whereas the word "Gift" in German means a poison you give someone. The meanings are linked, but knowing the one doesn't give definitive insight into the other. 

While the above is broadly based on my experience with the literature, here are a few references to help with respect to Kant and Hegel on these terms: Jon Stewart Kierkegaard's Relation to Hegel Reconsidered (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 311. He cites Alfred Elsigan "Zum Begriff der Moralität in Hegels Rechtsphilosophie," Wiener Jahrbuch für Philosophie 1972, p. 88 and Hegel's own *Philosophy of Right. 

This is easy to misunderstand because we also speak of "potential energies" in physics, but even a ball at the top of a half-pipe is either (a) already in motion or (b) waiting for something to make it move. If this set is right, we get two choices either an infinite series of prior As which Aquinas rejects as a vicious negative regress or some object that defies the normal definition of motion and causes its own motion. 

This probably cannot be answered per se. Instead, I'm going to answer by just sketching the interpretive field as I understand it. The general view among contemporary philosophers who interpret Kant is that Kant does not succeed in his proof in Groundwork part 3. This view is held by Christine Korsgaard, Henry Allison, and Allen Wood. Korsgaard offers an alternative where she argues that we attest to this by engaging in action at all. This occurs several places in her corpus but is the basic outcome of Sources of Normativity. This might be attested by his reduction of this to a fact of reason in Critique of Practical Reason. An attempt at a proof doesn't reoccur in Metaphysics of Morals, but there is something similar in Religion. In that volume, there's a consideration of how character works. Some see this as a failing of Kant's project as proof his idea of will is empty and his theory too. This is common as criticism from Hegelians and communitarians. Other's think it's replaceable with a different argument. 

Descartes proves that he exists but * is unsure of the existence of others. Using his proof, any person can prove that they exist but * be unsure of the existence of others). Ergo, all people's existence can be proved but simultaneously * the existence of all people is doubtful. 

= If on the other hand, our "thoughts" about objects come from our thinking, then I can know something about objects without encountering them in the world. 

Presumably appealing to authority is non-fallacious precisely when it makes sense to believe the person offering the information is reasonably expected to be knowledgeable on the topic. In other words, it's a question of what for us would qualify as an "authority." In this sense, it's going to tie into more basic epistemological considerations about knowledge. A general skeptic would have to say no one is "reasonably expected" to be knowledgeable about the matter at hand. Throwing out skepticism, one criterion appears for technical skills: objective success in matters relating to what they are also commenting on. Thus, I'd for instance take a successful carpenter to be someone I'd trust on matters of wood-working, an effective doctor on matters of medicine, etc. For theoretical things, it's going to be harder to know whether to accept the authority or not. A further criterion might be: are they accepted as an expert (in general? in my community?). In arguments, we can adduce a further thing: do we both agree here and now to treat this person as an authority? 

For this question, it might help to parse what type-identity theory means and what multiple realizability means. type identity The idea is that a type, i.e. a mental state, maps onto a physical brain state in a numerically identical fashion. Translated into plain English, this is the view that any mental state is exactly and in every respect one brain state. 

For Hegel, this would not be anti-individual or anti-freedom, but this reply to the objection hinges on some fancy footwork. If Hegel is right about the nature of consciousness and thought and then metaphysics, then it follows that freedom is the self using reason to pursue the goals of reason. And the goals of reason are deterministically knowable. In other words, Hegel is pro-individual and pro-freedom if it is the case that the Concept determines what the individual should do and has them pursue it. But this is a very unsatisfying reply if you're committed to a more robust concept of individual or freedom. Or to put it another way, if you believe in a freedom as incompatibilism such that actions are free when the individual can choose their actions or their action-shaping preferences without regard for a unified idea of progress, then this is unconvincing. To make it a bit more practical, for Hegel, you should contribute to society, and society will have certain ideals and values. To pick a near contemporary example, for a while the laws regarding gay marriage varied by state. If it was necessary that gay marriage be allowed, then states restricting it could not be allowed. Since it's become legal in all states, we've also seen periodic clashes that take it further -- should individuals be required to acknowledge or participate in the gay marriages of others? If there's a unified idea of progress and something is part of it, then on the Hegelian picture, there's no right of conscience to refuse to accept it or participate in it. Hegel doesn't find this problematic precisely because society trumps the isolated individual but incorporates the individual qua living, reasoning bit of the whole. If what we want is individuals who are free to be separate, then Hegel opposes this as an illusion (an immediacy and unmediated state). 

In short, his criticism of empiricists is that they are not at the end of the day empiricists about what it means to know. Roughly sketched, empiricism is the view that we perceive with our senses is true as a counterpart to Descartes' clear and distinct ideas. The problem is that there are two related questions: 

I'm going to suggest two things in answer. First, Occam's Razor is not well-defined. On one level, it's not at all clear what William of Ockham wrote except that it is some form of principle of parsimony (link). On another level, it's hard to find someone who knowingly offers an explanation with superfluous details. At least, that's my take on it. Second, my experience from my undergraduate days in chemistry was that chemists always operate under simplifications, and we try to pick the least sufficient simplification (by which I mean the simplest form that is sufficient for solving the problem). For instance, in many elementary experiments we act as if ΔH = ΔE. Or we consider gases in accordance with PV=nRT rather than the virial equations needed for real gases ($URL$ Similarly, we pick systems that are easy to calculate over those that are hard (beginning with using the metric system over imperial units). But in terms of philosophy of science literature, I don't know anywhere that directly addresses what you're asking (which could be because my AOSes and AOC are not in philosophy of science). See especially SEP. 

For Plato (at least middle), ideas are not things in our head but something more real than the things we encounter, which in turn inspires the things we encounter. To give this some concrete weight, think about a cow. I assume you can form an image of a cow. Then ask when you see actual cows, do you think your "idea" comes from the cow or that cows are copying an idea (with idea meaning a form that exists outside of any cow)? Plato's answer is the latter. There are a lot of different arguments for or against the existence of Forms. The advantage is that they can help explain how we can understand things. The big disadvantage is that we run into problems about (a) how we have these ideas in our head, (b) how many of these ideas exist, (c) what these ideas are. The point is to solve a problem where what we see in the world does not live up to the ideas. So to give a few examples from Plato, we have dialogues about the nature of piety, justice, and love. These are things we want to be better than some of the examples we might see in the world. There are not that many philosophers proper who are full fledged Platonists, because it's a pretty hard position to defend. But there are a lot of mathematical Platonists -- people who believe the numbers are real even apart from all of their instances.
