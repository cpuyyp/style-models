I welcome further discussion, and evidence supporting, or refuting my answer. If my idea is correct that antimatter is distributed fairly evenly through the voids between galaxies, and that antimatter is the cause of dark energy, then no, dark energy will not move earth out of the way of a sun that is heating up (e.g. it would have no effect, or very little effect). This is because antimatter would not exist within the solar system. Solar wind, and other particles would annihilate any antimatter that found its way into the solar system. A "galactic wind" would also likely prevent antimatter from even entering the galaxy. It would be interesting to see if we can observe earth's past position in relation to the sun (e.g. perhaps by examining the rocks or fossils) and see if earth is migrating out further from the sun or not. This analysis may show us if dark energy is indeed "everywhere" (true if the earth used to be closer, and is migrating away from the sun) or just in the "voids" (true if the earth is not migrating away from the sun). I very much welcome further discussion and answers. I especially welcome someone to perform the research as discussed in the prior paragraph. 

My main question is: Is there a strong galactic magnetic field, perhaps driven by the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy? I am also wondering if this field would be strong enough to make it so that the galaxy rotates in the way it does (with the outer stars moving faster than would be expected), and if this would be an alternate explanation for dark matter. The thing that led me to ask this question is reading about Jupiter's magnetic field interactions with the plasma emitted by IO. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the plasma to orbit Jupiter about as fast as Jupiter spins, and I am wondering if likewise, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy "herds" the rest of the galaxy in a similar manner as per the article and image below. $URL$ 

Do we consider the dwarf planet Ceres to be in the inner solar system or outer solar system (or possibly neither / in between). It is located within the asteroid belt, but is the asteroid belt part of the inner or outer solar system? 

Could the Philae comet lander be recharged with a laser (or possibly many lasers) from earth? My thought would be to aim one or more powerful lasers from earth at the Philae lander to recharge it through its solar panels. Another thought would be to heat up a small part of the comet with one or more lasers, possibly causing the comet to slowly rotate into a position where the sun light falls onto the lander. Would either of these ideas be feasible? 

My theory that I am trying to validate: Gravity is the flow of space into matter, and it flows out of antimatter. If this is true, antimatter should have "negative gravity", I would expect it to have a repelling effect, while matter has an attracting effect. For example, if antimatter were on earth (somehow without annihilating), it would fall to the planet. However, if there were an antimatter planet, objects would "fall up" off it. In fact, I believe the antimatter planet would break apart because of this quality. Furthermore, I don't believe antimatter planets or stars would form because of this quality (e.g. it would remain anti-hydrogen). I also theorize that it would be in parts of the universe where matter isn't (e.g. in the voids outside the galactic clusters), and would be very diffuse (because it would repel itself). I believe the theorized repelling effect of antimatter could be what we are observing as dark energy (hence why I am asking these questions). I just searched for this online to see if anyone else has this theory, and yes, someone has something very similar here: $URL$ 

Does antimatter have negative gravity? If antimatter has negative gravity, and is present in the universe with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, would it produce the observed amount of dark energy in the universe? 

Same answer as #1, which I calculate at 2418 days I welcome refinement / correction of my calculations, this is a "rough attempt". 

Could we detect an earth-like planet (e.g. similar distance from star, and similar size) with current planet finding techniques? If an earth-like planet were orbiting our nearest star, excluding the sun :-), would we have detected it by now? It seems current techniques tend to find large planets orbiting close to their star, or for direct observation, find large planets further away from their star. Likewise, we have found many very large planets very close to their star (e.g. hot Jupiters), and some rocky planets somewhat larger than earth close to stars, but not very many (if any) that are very similar to earth (e.g. distance from star and size). It seems the current techniques available do not readily detect earth-like planets though, so it may be that there really are many earth-like planets, but we haven't seen them yet. Here is an article on current planet detecting techniques. $URL$ 

Definitely a UFO - Unidentified Flying Object, not necessarily aliens :-). A few possibilities I can think of (would be nice to know how fast the objects were going, and whether or not they disappeared), arranged by most plausible to least plausible: Birds If it was just after sunset, or just before sun rise, birds could have been flying up far above, where the sun was shining, though it was dark on the ground. This would be moving fairly slowly through the sky. Shiny Balloon It could have been a shiny helium balloon drifting by with the lights of the city reflecting off it as it moved, causing the apparent motion. If this were the case, the "dots" should have stayed fairly close together, and it should have been fairly slow moving unless it was low and the wind was blowing fast. It would seem the pattern would be randomized, and not necessarily a "formation" though, unless formation just meant they were travelling together. Meteor fragments It could have been fragments of a meteor that broke up, but they would likely be travelling straight, and not flying in any recognizable formation (but would be going nearly same direction, likely spreading out with time, and burning up / disappearing). This would have gone fairly fast through the sky and disappeared, or at least shrunk if they were large fragments. Aliens At first, seemed the only plausible explanation, but there are others after thinking about it a bit. Satellites would not change formation like that, but there is a possibility atmospheric distortions (like the "waves of heat" you can see coming off the road on a hot day) could have caused the effect with a single passing satellite. However, you probably would have noticed the stars doing the same thing if that were the case. I am also not aware of multiple satellites being grouped together like that, and they would not be able to change formation like that. 

Not including the planets orbit, 31 is a prime number, and 78 breaks down to the factors of 2, 7, 7. Since there is no shared common denominator, it does not appear these will synch up more frequently than 78 * 31 = 2418 days 

Would the expansion of space (e.g. dark energy) move the earth further away from the sun over time, possibly saving us for perhaps a few billion years as the sun heats up? Scientists now tend to think that the sun is heating up very gradually (e.g. over billions of years): $URL$ Dark energy is the unexplained accelerating expansion of the universe, as described here: $URL$ Put another way, my question is, is dark energy working at such a rate that it would move earth (and other planets) further from the sun and prolong life on earth as the sun heats up? 

How much gravitational effect do we experience (e.g. maybe -.00001 G or smaller) from the edge of the visible universe? By edge of the visible universe, I am talking about the region of the cosmic microwave background and beyond. In the past, the universe was very hot and dense, and we are seeing the light from this time period as the Cosmic Microwave Background. It took slightly less than the age of the universe for that light to reach us, and it has become extremely redshifted with the expansion of space. Since gravity apparently travels at the speed of light, we should be experiencing a gravitational effect from this shell around us as well. As I understand, the universe was extremely dense back then, and it is around us in every direction, which would intensify the gravity greatly. However, it is extremely distant, which would weaken the gravity greatly. I don't know if redshift would affect gravity as it has the light from the cosmic microwave background, but if so, this would weaken the effect greatly as well. With all this in mind, I am curious, what would be the effect of gravity from the edge of the universe on us? Note: I would expect this to be a very small outward effect in all directions, something like -.00000001 g or something like that, but not 0. 

If we sent someone on a path that passed as near as possible to a black hole without getting pulled in, how far into the future would they go due to time dilation? Let's assume the black hole is 5 solar masses (I am assuming the mass will affect the calculation). I would like to know from two considerations: 

What color is earthshine (e.g the average color of earth that shines on the moon)? I am making a solar system exploration game, and would like to know this for the lighting of my moon level at night, with a "full earth". Edit: With your answers, this is what I get: 

According to numerous articles, solar flares have done damage to the power grid on Earth in the past: $URL$ 

Actually, "instant" gravity was part of Newton's theory of gravity. It is now understood that the "speed of gravity" is equal to the speed of light according to general relativity. $URL$ This has apparently fairly recently been confirmed, and is described in greater detail here: $URL$ 

Telescopes that use adaptive optics now use flexible mirrors to adjust for distortions in the atmosphere. The mirrors are flexed in real time to account for the distortions. I am wondering if it would be feasible to instead use fixed mirrors and use software to make the needed corrections to the image? 

Logically speaking, they should be spherical as things with higher gravity tend to collapse into spheres. Neutron stars are extremely dense, and have high gravity. However, they are as far as we know rotating extremely fast as well (e.g. Pulsars). It should be that the faster they rotate, the more disc-like they would become (like an ellipse or slight possibility of more of a disc in extreme cases). So, depending on rotation speed, sphere for no to fairly high rotation speed, ellipse for high rotation speed, or possibly even a disc for extremely high rotation speed. There is room for debate here, but this is how I logically see it. Edit: By ellipse, I mean a 3 dimensional ellipse, like an egg, but "squished the other way". Basically a sphere that has been stretched out on its equator. The faster it spins, the more it should be deformed (stretched along the equator). Dantopia's answer shows the shape I am describing.
