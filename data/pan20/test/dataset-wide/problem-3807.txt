I shall only propose an outline of the possible proof below, where Claim 1, Claim 2 and Claim 3 have not yet been proved rigorously. We shall begin the outline. So suppose that every element of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every parameter of $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation. Then, we consider the specialisation defined as follows$\colon$ $$(\lozenge) \quad X_i = S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m) \in K[[X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]].$$ Some sort of Bertini argument, i.e. Bertini irreducibility theorem for the hyperplane section, might justify the following Claim 1$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\, 1.}$ After the specialisation, by which I mean simply to insert $(\lozenge)$ into the irreducible polynomial $f$ at ${Q}\,2$ in the above, the specialised polynomial $s(f) \in K[[X_2,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]][X_1]$ remains still irreducible as long as $S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m)$ is sufficiently general. Moreover, conditions in the question remains unchanged with only the number of variables dropped by one. Thus we can use the induction on $m$ when $m \geq 4$. That is, the ideal $I_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,X_m]]$ turns into another ideal $K_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]]$ after specialisation. Besides, the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by the constant $C$ due to the induction hypothesis. Finally, we propose the following result$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,2.}$ There exists at least one general specialisation $(\lozenge)$ such that both numbers of generators of ideals $I_1$ and $K_1$ coincide with each other as long as $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ (i.e., $I_1$ does not contain every parameter $X_3,\ldots,X_m$). The assumption of $Q\,2$ ensures that actually $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ holds, for otherwise $J_1$ might not be monomial. Now, we proceed as follows. Since the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by $C$, Claim 2 ensures that the number of generators of $I_1$ is also bounded by $C$ as desired as long as $m \geq 4$. So eventually, the induction argument obliges us only to show the following claim$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,3.}$ $Q\,1$ is correct. Wishfully, this outline should be justified rigorously at least in the case where every element $\alpha_i$ of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation, i.e. $\alpha_i = \underset{e_2,\ldots,e_m}{\Sigma} c_{e_2\ldots,e_m \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}}\,X_2^{e_2} \cdots X_m^{e_m}$. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$. 

Let $k$ be sufficiently large .Denote the sequence $n,a_1,...a_{k-1}$ with $a_i\leq i+1$ where $i\leq k-1$. The sum of the first $k$ elements including $n$ (denote it by $S_+(a_k)$) must be always a multiple of $k$ . So let $d$ be a positive integer with $S_+(a_k)=d\cdot k=n+a_1+...+a_{k-1}\leq n+2+...+k=n-1+k\frac{k+1}{2}$ . So $d=\frac{S_+(a_k)}{k}=\frac{n-1}{k}+\frac{k +1}{2}<k$ for $k$ large enough. We will see that the period we want is the number $d$. We will show that the next element $a_k$ is the number $d$ and inductively we wil reach our goal. Let $a_k$ be the next element ,so we must have $k+1|S_+(a_{k+1})$ meaning that $k+1|d\cdot k+a_k$ which gives $k+1|a_k-d$. But $a_k\leq {k+1}$ and $d<k$ so we have only the case $a_k-d=0$ and so, $a_k=d$ (Repeat the argument again) So we only wait until $\frac{n-1}{k}+\frac{k+1}{2}<k$ to find the period $d$. This gives the bound closely to $\sqrt n$ which Lucia commented. I hope this helps. 

Has it been proved or disproved that for any fixed $a\geq 1$ there are infinitelly many primes $p_n\equiv a\pmod{n}$? I believe i have proved that for every $a\geq1$ there are infinitelly many natural numbers $m$ with $m\equiv a\pmod{\pi(m)}$ where $\pi(m)$ is the prime counting function and i was wondering if this can be also true for a smallest subset of $\mathbb{N}$ (the primes). OEIS does not tell much.$URL$ Any reference would be appreciated. Thank you for viewing. 

Let $N=\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}$. We sum all the elements of every nonempty subset of $N$. Which sum(s) appears most often? (Let's call this sum a champion). Using a simple pigeonhole argument a champion must appear at least $\frac{2^n-1}{T_n}$ times. ($T_n$ denotes the $n$-th triangular number). It seems that the champion should be somewhere around $T_n/2$ but I cannot prove it. Am I missing something obvious here? 

So , I suppose that even a weaker form of the question (that at least once the result is composite if $a$ is even) is still an open problem. 

Are there infinitely many positive integers with the property: If $n$ is a sum of two $k$th powers then it is also the sum of two $k-1$th powers, the sum of two $k-2$th powers, ... , the sum of two squares? For example let $n=2^5+1^5=31$. It is the sum of two 5th powers but not the sum of two squares. I am not sure if this has been studied before. Here we suppose that $k\ge 3$. EDIT: I will give an example mentioned in a comment by Aaron Meyerowitz: Since $2^{25}$ is a sum of two 24th powers it is required that it is a sum of two 23rd powers, of two 22nd powers etc. We may be able to find a number $n$ which is of the form $n=a^2+b^2=c^3+d^3=x^4+y^4$ and this seems ok. But it is possible that also $n=k^{12}+l^{12}$ for some $k,l>0$, so we must check if this number is also the sum of two 11th powers, two 10th powers etc.If not, it does not "pass the test". 

We shall suppose that for any couple $m, n$ with $m > n$, ${\frak a}_m \mapsto {\frak a}_n, f_m \mapsto f_n$, respectively by the natural quotient surjection $A_m \twoheadrightarrow A_n$, i.e., eliminating variables $X_{n+1},...,X_m$ in $A_m$. Now, I should like to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture: Suppose that $m \gg n$ and $k(m) \gg k(n)$. Then the following inequality holds$\colon$ $l(m) > l(n)$. 

Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be integral schemes of finite type over a field $K$ (i.e., locally affine opens are finitely-generated algebras over $K$). Suppose we have the following condition$\colon$ $f \colon Y \to X$ is finite. We consider a dominant morphism $g \colon Z \to X$. Q. Suppose that ${\cal O}_Y \cap {\cal O}_Z = {\cal O}_X$. Then is it possble that $Y \times_X Z$ is not integral while $Y \times_X \eta_Z$ being integral ? As in the answer below in the case $Y = Z$, there is an example as $Y$ being a normalisation of $X$. 

Let ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be a $n$-variable polynomial ring over a complex number field ${\Bbb C}$. For its maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$, we define the geometric regular local ring as $R \colon= {\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_{(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}$, which is the localisation of ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ at $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. $R$ has the unique maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. We shall consider the polynomial ring $R[X]$ over $R$ and choose $m$ Weierstrass polynomials \begin{align} & f_1(X) = c_{1,0} + c_{1,1}X + \ldots + c_{1,e_1}X^{e_1} \\ & {\phantom{AAA}} ... \\ & f_m(X) = c_{m,0} + c_{m,1}X + \ldots + c_{m,e_{m}}X^{e_m}, \end{align} where $c_{1,0},\ldots,c_{i,j},\ldots,c_{m,e_m} \in (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. Suppose that ${\mathrm{GCD}}(f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X)) = 1$. Now for a function $F(X) \in R[X]$, we consider the following condition$\colon$ $(\sharp)$ $\quad F(\alpha) \in (f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))\phantom{A}$ for any $\alpha \in {\Bbb C}$, where $(f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))$ is the ideal of $R$. Q. Does $F(X) \in (f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X))$? 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D. 

(As it was asked) here is the proof: We will see that if a proper choise of maximum number of elements not exceeding $n$ with the mentioned property exists,then we can construct another (equivalent) set of elements containing only prime powers. Suppose that the maximum number of elements we can choose from $\{2,...,n\}$ with the mentioned property is $r\geq \pi(n)+1$. It is impossible to have all elements prime powers because by the pigeonhole principle there will be 2 elements $p^a,p^b$ with $a<b$ and $p^a|p^b$ which means that the desired property does not hold for $p^a$. So,there must be at least one element that can be written as $x=k\cdot m$ with $\gcd (k,m)=1$. If $k$ does not divide the product of the rest elements and so does $m$, then we can pull out $x$ from the set and place $k$ and $m$ into the set ,having a new set with $r+1$ elements with property (A) holding true. (of course no other of the elements is equal to $k$ or $m$ because this would again lead to a contradiction) But this is a contradiction since $r$ is the maximum number of elements as we assumed. So,without loss of generality we may assume that $k$ does not divide the product of the rest,but $m$ does. This means that we can replace $x$ with $k$ in the set with property A) holding true. We repeat the argument again until $k$ "drops" to a prime power. ( which lets us arrive at a contradiction for prime powers as we already mentioned at the beggining) (By the way this is not Erdos's proof but one i found some years ago.But i am almost sure Erdos proved this theorem) So, your set must have at most $\pi(n)$ elements. On the other hand, if your set contains at least $\pi(n)+1$ elements it could contain 2 powers of the same prime,$p,p^m$ and so the gcd you want would be at least $x=p$ (or $x=p^m$). I think it would be more difficult to determine the asymptotic size of $S$ depending on $k$ but certainly $|S|\leq\pi(n)$ holds for a random set $S$ as you require. 

In Mathematics everyone believed that Hilbert's second problem had an affirmative answer but it was (later) shown that this is not entirely true and I suppose that the consistency of arithmetic has now been "disappeared" 

Some days ago, I noticed that $3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11 +1=34^2$. I am almost sure that if we denote four consecutive primes by $p, q, r, s$ then the equation
