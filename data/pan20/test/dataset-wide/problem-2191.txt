The number one cause of slicing, irrespective of the exact aspect of the swing that is lacking, is a "grip it and rip it" mentality to your swing. This generally causes a number of timing and posture issues that open the clubface, bring the swing out of line, etc etc. So, the number one thing to do is slow it down. You can send the ball MUCH farther than you think with a very easy swing, and an extreme windup (the kind where you end up able to see the clubhead out in front of you in your peripheral vision) will cause more problems with accuracy than it solves with distance. From a technical standpoint, slices happen when the club induces a clockwise (for a rightie) sidespin on the ball. This induces a force called Magnus lift, where the leading edge of the rotation on the left side of the ball brings the turbulent air from the back of the ball around to the front along that side as part of the ball's "boundary layer", and so causes the boundary layer on that side to be thicker. That thicker, relatively higher-pressure boundary layer pushes the ball in the opposite direction (to the right). Sidespin is induced whenever the clubhead moves in a direction other than the direction the clubhead faces. The direction of the face determines the line the ball will launch along; the difference between that line and the line of movement of the clubhead determines sidespin. For a slice, the clubhead is moving to the left of the direction it faces. Most commonly, this is because the clubhead faces right of the intended line. Here's how to diagnose and fix the most common slices, for a right-hand golfer. At the driving range bay, determine the desired line of travel, and draw a line or place a club along that line. Put your toes right up to that line (a "square stance"), address the ball as you normally do, take your normal swing (ensuring you make solid contact), and find the symptom that best describes the ball's flight: Push Slice: 

When I was listening to a Sirius NHL broadcast this morning, as they were going through the recap and highlights, they mentioned that a player had gotten a goal that was marked unassisted, as he got his own rebound off the goal post and subsequently scored. (I believe it was Kyle Clifford of the Kings vs the Vegas Golden Nights on 2/27/18, but unsure.) They were surprised that it was recorded unassisted, and as I understand the rules of hockey, if a player gets his own rebound from a shot blocked by the goalie and scores, the assist(s) go to the last one or two players to touch the puck in a contributing manner. I looked at some assist rules and clarifications on the web, but I can't find anything that would suggest that should have been an unassisted goal. Is there a case for this, or was the recording of an unassisted goal in error? 

Rule 3.15 of the International Racquetball Federation states that "avoidable hinders", which result in loss of the rally, include: 

Catches, runs, and boundaries are all possible if the ball touches the bat at any point, regardless of what else the ball may go on to touch. Furthermore, if the ball hits the pad before the bat, an LBW dismissal may also be possible. Only if the ball does not touch the batsman's person may Byes be scored (Law 26.1), and only if it touches the batsman's person but not bat may Leg byes be scored (Law 26.2) (an oversimplification, but sufficient for the purposes of this answer). Once the ball has touched any part of the batsman's person, he/she may not intentionally strike it again (other than to protect his/her wicket), as this would mean he/she was out hit the ball twice (Law 34). 

My original answer was incorrect. Matt's application of rule 7.08e is correct; once the force is removed by tagging out the batter (the following runner), R1 is safe on either first or second and is not required to advance. It's a tricky situation all around, but R1 basically made the right call by standing on first; 1B would have to both muff the catch and let the batter reach on error to force R1 to advance to second. If R1 had left the base and headed to second, that opens up a couple of DP scenarios; 1B could have caught the ball and tagged R1 returning to first, or could have muffed, tagged the batter, then thrown to second for a tagout or pickling of R1. If the basemen have some real cannons or the batter had given up halfway to first, 1B could have made it a force play at second and then forced out the batter back at first, but in amateur baseball pretty much any other scenario is more likely. 

The problem with bowling is that there are so many things to think about, especially as a beginner. With absolute beginners, I attempt to make it as simple as possible. 

As of 19 October 2016, there have been 25 instances of a player taking 10 wickets in a match and scoring fifty or more runs in an innings. Sir Richard Hadlee is currently the only player to have done so more than once: he achieved the feat in three Tests. 

The answer lies in the fact that it is considered to be harder to play a ball that is spinning away from the body than a ball that is spinning in towards the body. Therefore off spin and chinaman bowlers, who naturally move the ball away from the left-hander, will be expected to be most effective against left-handed batsmen. By contrast, leg spin and slow left arm bowlers, who naturally move the ball away from the right-hander, will be expected to excel against right-handed batsmen. 

There is no rule I can find in the rules of basketball that says a player must remain shod (shoed?) during play of the game while the ball is live. Therefore, a player who loses a shoe must stay on the court until the next stoppage (timeout or foul call, usually). They are not allowed to leave the court to put the shoe back on (that's a technical foul for too few players on the court). They may move to the side and try to put their shoe on, or they may continue to be part of the play, but if you try running along a basketball court and then suddenly stopping or changing direction with a stocking foot you'll realize there's just no way, especially for a forward or center who has to maneuver in traffic. A shooting guard, maybe. What should happen is the player's team should get a stoppage of play; get hold of the ball, take a 20-second time out, let the guy put his shoe on or bench him. However, that doesn't always happen immediately: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ (IMO that should have been a technical) 

Good question. A common mistake is to select a bat that is too big for a young player. The temptation may be to buy a large bat for the player to "grow into", to save money as much as anything else, but it's definitely not a good idea. The bat should feel comfortable to and manoeuvrable by the player. Bob Woolmer's Art and Science of Cricket has this to say on choosing a bat for a young player (p.101): 

In the scenarios you outline, the contact, and any obstruction, is unintentional, and therefore there would be no penalty or dismissal (other than the catch, if it was made). 

Law 24 (No ball) prohibits underarm bowling except by special arrangement, as your findings indicate. If the captains were to agree to underarm bowling, I don't see how it could be considered deceptive, since it has been specifically highlighted and therefore is unlikely to cause any surprise, especially since you would have to inform the umpire and batsman when you are going to do so. It would not be a sustainable long-term strategy as I would not think captains likely to agree to underarm bowling (it was used in an infamous incident in a 1981 one-day match between Australia and New Zealand). Coincidentally, I was playing cricket yesterday and one (new) player did end up bowling underarm; it was a social match and we did not object, but in future it will be necessary for him to learn to bowl overarm. Finally, without knowing the intricacies of fastpitch softball, I would be doubtful that underarm bowling in cricket would do anything other than provide an easy hit to the batsman. The renowned England captain Mike Brearley would occasionally bowl underarm, but he was primarily a batsman, not a bowler; his was an attempt to try something new to unsettle the batsman. It didn't work: as far as I know, he never took a wicket with such an action! 

For many many years, elite swimmers (well, actually any swimmer with a big meet) will shave almost everything from their bodies, and serious cyclists will do the same. The claim is that shaving reduces drag and thus makes you faster, but has this ever been proven? Or is this merely apocryphal lore? 

The curling case is very puzzling, as the drug in question is meldonium, which basically allows slightly greater endurance by opening up blood flow and regulating energy in the cells. Even curlers are puzzled about it, as evidenced by this article. One of the possible side effects is tachycardia, which would be detrimental to the fine control needed for curling. As the article mentions, beta blockers to slow the heart rate would be much more likely to be used (As they were in golf in a minor fashion, IIRC it was Davis Love that admitted to trying them in the book A Good Walk Spoiled). 

Basically, a rangefinder's advantage is that it tells you exactly how close you are to the pin (or to some other object you're rangefinding), instead of approximately how close you are based on your relative distance to some other known marker, like the approach stake. With a good rangefinder, it's possible to get an accurate distance reading (usually within a yard, sometimes to tenths of a yard) on almost any object on the course, from the near to far edge of a dogleg landing, to the rocks at the near edge of a water hazard, to any stake, tree or other significant landmark through the green, and of course the pin. In the interest of full disclosure, any device intended to be used for distance gauging, or any device incorporating this ability as a major feature of its design, is disallowed by strict rules (Rule 14-3) under penalty of disqualification. The Rules, however, also allow courses to implement a Local Rule allowing them overriding 14-3, and for casual play, virtually all courses do allow them, with many even providing such a device in the form of GPS systems in the carts. Rangefinders have the most benefit on courses where planning your shots require you to know more than just the distance to the pin, and on courses that have more limited information along the way. If you need to know how far it is to that dogleg landing, so you can drop your tee shot there before changing direction, and there's nothing useful on the scorecard map or in your cart to help you gauge it, then a rangefinder will definitely save you a few strokes finding out by trial and error. Similarly, if the holes only have yard markings from the tees and no other distance aids through the green, and you can't rely on "dead reckoning" based on the average distances of your clubs (due to high winds, or the fact you're hitting shorter or longer than you'd expect on that day), a rangefinder can be invaluable. On many courses I've played, however, you usually have at least an approach stake telling you you're, say, 150 yards from the edge of the green, and given where your ball actually lies relative to that stake, and how far back the pin is from the edge of the green, your distance to pin can be reckoned accurately enough to drop your ball on the green within putting distance from there. Most obstacles, similarly, are positioned such that playing over and around them is relatively natural; you can, at the very least, play it safe your first time on that course and hit away from or a little softer than you normally would, and then when you're sure your next shot will carry the hazard, you hit out longer. Your next time out, knowing how you played it last time, you might go for more club and a stronger swing to carry the tee shot over the hazard, setting up an easier GIR or even a birdie try. 

Along with the other examples already cited, an unusual incident occurred in 1975, when the 3rd Ashes Test at Headingley was abandoned as a draw due to an act of sabotage: before the fifth day's play, the pitch was dug up and damaged with oil by campaigners calling for the release of a convicted criminal. 

Note also that despite bearing the name "Youth Tests", age-group international multi-day matches are not classified as Test matches, as the document makes clear: 

There is no requirement to have 11 fielders on the field at all times. Law 1 (The players) makes provision for the number of players per team to be varied by agreement of the captains: 

Note that while a no ball and a wide ball are types of delivery, dead ball is a state. Put simply, the ball is not dead whenever it is in play. According to Law 23.5:
