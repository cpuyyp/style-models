I think the main thing with HIIT is to get your heart rate up to 80-90% max with hard work, followed by a period of what is called active rest, followed by more work. You don't need to do complex movements with rapid jump ups, squats, etc... (I'm picturing jump squat burpees). Although a lot of people think it's high impact, when done correctly, jumping rope is a low impact workout with high potential for reaping the rewards from HIIT. So, that's one thing you may want to look into. Although, admittedly, the learning curve may involve higher impact which may be detrimental. Also, since there is a somewhat significant (for most people) learning curve, frustration with learning the exercise properly may lead to quitting early. Another option is a stationary bike. For the first six months of my weight loss and fitness journey, I got on the stationary bike, pedaled normal for 1:30, and then doubled the resistance and pedaled like hell for :30 seconds. I would do eight cycles of that and then I was absolutely done. Total time: 20 minutes. On that note, you can pick pretty much any cardio exercise (elliptical, recumbent bike, etc...) and do the same type of workout. A third option I am thinking about is an agility ladder. Agility ladders are super cheap, and can even be made with something like duct tape on your floor. There are a ton of YouTube videos regarding HIIT agility ladder training. So, while some exercises may be slightly higher impact than others, there are such an infinite number of configurations you can do, surely you'll be able to find something that'll work. Finally, I'll give you an example of one of the HIIT workouts I do that a friend told me about. This one is harder than you think, and works very well! 1 minute of Jumping Jacks, 1 minute of Mountain Climbers, 1 minute of Inchworms, and 1 minute of bodyweight squats. That's 1 round. Do 4 rounds with 1 minute rest in between rounds. That's a 20 min. workout. Admittedly, there is some minor impact with the jumping jacks, and potentially, with the mountain climbers. I suspect, based on what you wrote, that you'd be capable of doing that, but, of course, only you would know. 

I do both. I find the treadmill a very nice alternative on days with nasty weather. Also, I tend to use the treadmill for a while if I'm just recovering from an injury. Nothing sucks more than being 5 miles from home/transportation and getting re-injured. One drawback, for me at least, is that treadmills tend to give you up-to-the-minute distance statistics: 1.2 miles... 1.3 miles.... 1.4 miles... and time statistics: 25:46, 25:47.... There is something about that that completely gets into my head. I can run for 30, 40, 50 minutes outdoors with no problems whatsoever. Have me watch the clock on a treadmill and there's something about it that gets completely inside my head. By the 15 minute mark I'm thinking I'll never make 20 minutes... "You mean I feel like this at the 15 minute mark? How will I ever get 'x' far?" It's hard not to notice these little incremental changes since the treadmill is designed to prominently display it to you. I would prefer it just flash statistics maybe every 5-10 minutes or so rather than always being present. Running outside, I have to deliberately check my fitness tracker for a time and/or distance check. Most of the time, I don't even really care. I might look down, especially when running trails or in a place with a lot of scenery, and say, "Wow! It's already been 45 minutes?!" 

Do what one of my running partners does with me. Run alongside me until you feel the need to "stretch it out" and then go sprint ahead for a bit. Then return back and run alongside. In some cases you can get close to running 1.5 times the distance (as logged by our fitness trackers). 

I don’t know why people try to complicate fitness so much. I think from a novice’s perspective, they view fitness as something that must be so complex. It doesn’t help that they have people offering advice, that while genuine and with good intention, makes things more complicated. Here’s the truth: You are obese. You carry a ton of weight around with you all day. By proxy of that, you are actually burning a lot of calories doing that. The most important thing you can do at this point is to figure out a sustainable (as in lifelong) diet plan that you can stick to. Just plan on 2500 calories a day and log your food. Then buy a FitBit and start walking. If you’re eating well and walking, the fat will start coming off. When you hit a plateau (weight stops coming off), then up the intensity in the form of faster walking, longer walking, etc... I wouldn’t bother lifting weights for a while. Don’t overcomplicate it and don’t let anyone overcomplicate it for you. The biggest turnoff for people starting is having to sort through a mess of hundreds of thousands of “rules” of crap they’re supposed to do or not do. You have plenty of time to make things complicated. For now, start with the basics and gather the discipline to walk every day and stick to a proper diet. If you want motivation, listen to “Jocko Podcast.” Former Navy SEAL who talks about discipline. I side with him that “motivation” is this wishy-washy thing that comes and goes but discipline is the act of doing the things you should be doing no matter how you feel. 

I have the same issue. Rows, will work the lats very well. There are about a million variations on rows too, so try them and see what works best for you. Quite frankly, I think the inverted row is one of the best back exercises one can do. It's body weight, but beginners can bring their legs closer to their body while more advanced folks can leave their legs extended. Once that's no longer challenging you can switch to a one-armed row too. Oh, and you need almost zero equipment. Maybe a broomstick and two chairs? That said, look around here and see if there are any other back exercises you can do that won't hurt your shoulder. But, give the inverted row a shot. You might be surprised that it's such a challenging exercise. 

What you're describing is, I believe, called a "Deadhang Pull-up," in which you return to the Deadhang position at the end of the eccentric portion of the exercise. Simply put, this is what I consider to be a correct pull-up. That being said, your mention of ball-and-socket joint issues is not incorrect. Whether you're performing a deadhang pull-up or you're just doing deadhangs, a critical component of the form is to ensure that you're "packing" your shoulders. That is, you should be retracting your scapula. This video shows how to properly deadhang and this video gives a lot of good advice on pull-ups in general. 

To answer your question... You'd probably build muscle with that diet. I believe the recommended protein intake is 1.5 grams per kilogram to build muscle. Your diet has you at 95 grams if it's been calculated correctly so, yeah, no protein powder needed. I have to be honest... While I applaud your efforts in eating right and trying to build some muscle (and stay/get in shape), I think you might be surprised by what eating a well-rounded, healthy, diet might do. Shoehorning oneself into a laser-focused diet to achieve a goal is usually a road laden with failure. I'm not saying it's impossible, or that it won't work, but you've given yourself so many rules to start with: At least 19 by each individual menu item you eat daily. Once you break one, it's generally only a matter of time before others fall. This is a pretty well-documented phenomenon in the weight loss world. There is little reason to think it would be much different in the weight gain world. To put it another way... You've restricted yourself from ALL of the foods on this earth with the exception of the 19 menu items (23 if you count the ORs) provided to you. How long until you break the rules? A diet rich with HEALTHY meats, veggies, fruits, and, OMG yes - whole grains, and maybe the occasional protein supplement will probably be indistinguishable (in terms of how much you gain) than from your pre-planned diet - especially as you embark on your fitness journey. Once you begin to make gains and stick with your workout regimen, I would maybe think about a stricter "gains diet." Prove to yourself first that you're willing to put in the work to get those gains. Focus on a healthy, well-rounded diet in the interim, and you'll be much better off. Also, did you have input into this plan or was it something your trainer made up for you? The reason I ask is that trainers have a habit of picking menu items THEY like to eat - not what you like to eat. I had a trainer tell me one time to eat three boiled eggs a day. That sounds great, but I hate boiled eggs. With a passion. How long do you think it was until I quit that? Finally... Your cousin is probably "saggy" because of an increased body fat ratio - not because of supplements. Although, depending on what type of "supplements" he was taking, it is possible they caused some of the problem, but probably not from protein powder. 

As far as exercise goes, I would try building more muscle. Trust me, bodybuilders take years of dedicated hard work to get that thick. Doing 3 sets of 12 reps isn’t going to make you turn into the Hulk. For that matter, running a mile to a mile and a half isn’t doing much. Traveling a mile, whether walking or running, burns about 110 calories. The way I see it, you’re basically burning off some juice for your HIIT workout and weightlifting session. If you’re taxed from cardio and weightlifting before HIIT, you’re not really going to maximize the benefit of the HIIT. I honestly think you’re better off weightlifting with good intensity 2-3 days a week and doing HIIT and/or long, steady-state cardio 2-3 days a week (depending on your goals). Do that while maintaining a calorie deficit of approx. 500 calories a day and you’ll be on the right path. If you’re performing solid, intense workouts, you’ll start to experience the right cardio/muscular gains. In turn, this will help start the metabolic processes of burning fat - especially visceral fat. One other thing I’d like to note: MOST people actually know what they need to do to lose the weight. They might not like the answers and often times they’re hoping for some sort of miraculous cure for their weight problems. Maybe, just maybe, there will be some insight that someone will give them and the switch will flip? I hope you get some of that, but deep down you probably know where the weaknesses are and whether or not you’re performing in the gym as intensely as you could be. Eat clean and hit it hard. You’ll watch weight disappear. 

Diet. Don't fall for the BS low-carb, only eat watermelon on a full moon, except when dark chocolate has been conjured by a sorcerer diet. Those diet systems might work, but they're hard to sustain long term. What you are seeking... what anyone should be seeking.... is a LIFEstyle change - not a short term fix. Eat what you want. The only catch is that you get fanatical about logging your calories. If it goes in your mouth, you log it. Then try to burn 500 fewer calories a day then you take in. You'll lose about a pound a week and you'll quickly see where you're probably taking in extra calories. Usually it's sodas and lattes. For others it's that "cheat" donut they have every single morning for breakfast. The FitBit, which is what I use, and other fitness monitors, will help you keep track of your calorie burn and intake. As long as you're willing to commit to tracking what you eat, weight loss isn't that hard. Walking 2 miles, while good for you, isn't really going to do a whole lot for weight loss - especially if you say "I was good today, I walked 2 miles. I can eat that pizza." I'm not saying you do that, but it's the mentality most people have. Simply put: Be disciplined about your diet and exercise.
