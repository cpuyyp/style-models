I think the answer to Question 1 is yes, at least for finite graphs. Lets $(T,E)$ be a graph. You can choose a group $G$ that is large enough to do the following: For each node $x∈V$ choose a subgroup $G_x$ (called stabilizer) such that the intersection of all subgroups is $\{1\}$ and each subgroup has a different cardinality. Then you can form the graph in the following way: $$ V= \dot\bigcup_{t∈T} \{gG_t\mid g∈G\}, \mbox{ and } F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}.$$ Then each node $t$ is broken up into $|G/G_t|$ pairwise unconnected nodes. And each edge is split up into a complete bipartite graph connecting all equivalent vertices. By changing the group size and the size of the stabilizer you can ensure that any two edges in $F$ have the same valency iff they belong to the same node in $T$. For more information: 

There is a theorem of Gitik, Kanovei and Koepke that characterises the degrees of constructibility in $M[G]$ where $G$ is prikry generic over the model $M$: they are isomorphic to the $P(\omega)/Fin$ of $M[G]$. That is they show (letting $M, G$ be as above with $x=G_C$ the actual prikry sequence): $$∀Z ∈ M[x] ∃y ⊆ x, y ∈ M[x] \wedge M[Z] = M[y].$$ They identify a $\kappa^+$-c.c quotient p.o. $P/y$ needed to see that if $y\subseteq x$ is an infinite subset of the Prikry generic $x$, then $x=G_C$ is $M[y]$-generic for $P/y$ and $M[G_C]$ is also $M[y][G_C]$. This in short, I think answers your questions; (at least the answer to Q1 is "Yes". I am not quite sure what you mean by "pairwise generic" for the case of $y,w$ disjoint - say the Evens and Odds in the sequence $x$ - but anyway, yes in the above sense: $w$ is generic for a quotient forcing over $M[y]$). (This includes your `weaker version'.) I don't know if the result is published, but there are slides with quite a bit of detail of Koepke at: $URL$ 

There are several approches for defining formal contexts of the form $\mathbb K(V,V,J)$ where $V=G\dot ∪M$ and $I∪I^{-1}⊆J$. Some of them are described in [1][2]. If you chose $I∪I^{-1}=J$, then the result is rather trivial: You get two oppositely ordered lattices side by side linked just by $0$ and $1$. Maybe you have something different in mind which I can't deduce from your Edit so far. We can describe the position of a concept $(A,A^{≤})$ by its supremum irreducibles below and the infimum irreducibles above it. Thus, you can take any concept of $(A,B)∈\mathfrak B(G,M,≤)$. If $at(G)$ are the objects that generate the atoms of the concept lattice $\mathfrak B(G,M,≤)$ and $coat(M)$ are the attributes that generate the coatoms of the lattice, then $(A,B)$ corresponds to the concept $\bigl(A∩at(G),B∩coat(M)\bigr)$ regarding $\tilde <$. So you have a subcontext. Whenever you remove an irreducible the corresponding chain is shortened by $1$. Francesco Kriegel has discussed this process in his diploma thesis. The aspect of adding a chain is partly considered in this article. For FCA there is no difference whether you consider preordered sets (reflexive and transitive relations) or ordered sets.[3] [1] Ganter, B.; Wille, R. “Formal Concept Analysis”, Mathematical foundations, Springer [2] Ganter, B.; Wille, R. “Formale Begriffsanalyse”, Mathematische Grundlagen, Springer [3] The only difference can be discussed looking at the context: When it is not clarified it the “order” relation is just a preorder. On the other hand the formal concepts consist of two sets so it doesn't matter wheter your relation is antisymmetric. 

The forcing to add $\kappa$ many Cohen reals is c.c.c and thereby preserves all cardinals but destroys the fact that $\kappa$ is even strongly inaccessible. (See for example Kunen "Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs" North-Holland, Ch. VII.) 

I think for the Theorem one can get by with a subcompact cardinal, which is weaker than a $\kappa^+$-supercompact. ( $\kappa$ is subcompact if for any $A\subseteq H_{\kappa^+}$ there are $j,\mu < \kappa, B\subseteq H_{\mu^+}$ with $j:(H_{\mu^+},\in, B) \longrightarrow_e (H_{\kappa^+},\in, A)$. ( where $ \longrightarrow_e$ means ``is an elementary map''. ) ) Let $\kappa$ be subcompact as above, and let $A = \mathop{Sat} = {Sat}_{\kappa^+}$ Then $\mathop{Sat} \subseteq H_{\kappa^+}$, and applying the definition of subcompactness there are $\mu < \kappa$, $j$, and $\overline{\mathop{Sat}}$ with $j : (H_{\mu^+}, \overline{\mathop{Sat}}) \longrightarrow_e (H_{\kappa^+}, \mathop{Sat})$. Then $\overline{\mathop{Sat}}= {Sat}_{\mu^+}$ can be checked easily. $j$ is easily in $H_{\kappa^+}$ but the point of having the Sat predicate is that we can express in a first order way (in the extended language) that there is a $j$ with $ran(j)$ an elementary substructure of $(H_{\kappa^+},\in)$. Thus $(H_{\kappa^+}, {Sat}) \models$``${ran} (j) \prec_e (V, \in)$'' indeed: $(H_{\kappa^+}, {Sat}) \models$``There is $k, \kappa_0,$ with $k : (H_{\kappa_0^+}, \in) \longrightarrow (V, \in)$ and ${ran} (k) \prec_e (V, \in) ,$ and thus $k$ is an elementary map.'' This goes down to $(H_{\mu^+}, {Sat}_{\mu^+})$. This starts out links in the chain, using the restriction of the map(s) $k$ to the domain $V_{\kappa_0 +1}$ etc. and the rest of the argument is as before. 

Let's rephrase the problem: $(Γ,≤)$ (with $G ≤ H$ iff $G=H$ or $G < H$) is a preordered set (transitive and reflexive). $<$ is not necessarily symmetric, $≤$ is not necesserily an equivalence relation. Then $R_<$ is the set of suborders that are Elements of $Γ$. For order relations the set of the principal ideals or the set principal filters form such constructions. If I'm not mistaken in a preorder the set the principal ideals ordered by set inclusion is isomorphic to the order relation that arises if you factor out the equivalence classes. An important fact is that the induced subgraph of a preorder relation is still a preorder relation. So if $G$ is an ordered set then it is $<$ representable in the ordered set of its primary ideals. For preorders we can represent an element $x$ by a set $I(x,G)$ that contains $x∈G$ and all elements $y∈G$ that are strictly below $x$ (those $y$ such that $x≥y$ and $x\not≤y$ hold). So 

Edit added to address Gro-Tsen's queries (see comment below) and intended to complete both the original Question and its second reformulation: (A) The function $F(\delta)=L_\delta$ is p.r. (See Devlin, "Constructibility" but I think it is in [1] anyway.) Satisfaction is likewise p.r., hence the function: $G(\delta)=1$ if $L_\delta \vDash $ '' $A\wedge \forall\delta' L_{\delta'} \vDash \neg A$''; $G(\delta)=0$ otherwise is p.r. and gives that the least $\delta$ with $L_\delta\vDash A$ is p.r. recognizable. (B) Let $\beta<\sigma_1$ . We want that $\beta$ is p.r. recognizable*. Let $A$ be a $\Sigma_1$ sentence that is first true at some $\gamma \in (\beta, \sigma_1)$. By standard arguments the $<_L$-least bijection $f_\gamma:\omega\leftrightarrow \gamma$ is definable over $L_\gamma$. Suppose $f_\gamma(n)=\beta$. By the kind of argument in (A) we see that $ \gamma$ is p.r. recog*. But then so is $L_{\gamma+1}$ and $f_\gamma$. Put these facts together to build a p.r. function $G$ whose only non-zero value is $G(\gamma)=\beta$. (C) We answer this (and, using the first Lemma above, finish the original Question) by: Lemma Let $\alpha < \beta_0$. Then $\alpha$ is p.r. recog. Hence the least p.r. reflecting ordinal is $\beta_0$ which in turn is the least non-p.r. recog. ordinal. Proof: Say that $\alpha$ begins a gap if $\exists \delta ( L_\alpha \prec_{\Sigma_1} L_\delta)$. We say that $[\alpha,\delta]$ is a gap, if $\alpha$ begins a gap, and $\delta$ is maximal with $L_\alpha \prec_{\Sigma_1} L_\delta$. $\bullet$ If $\omega < \delta < \beta_0$ is not in any gap, then we are sufficiently low down in the $L$-hierarchy where there is a $\Sigma_1$ sentence $A=A(\delta)$ so that $L_{\delta+1}\vDash $ ``$A\wedge\forall \delta’<\delta L_{\delta’ + 1}\vDash \neg A$ ‘’. As argued above at (A), this makes $\delta+1$ and so $\delta$ p.r. recog. We just need the ordinals of gaps $[\alpha,\delta]$ with $\alpha <\beta_0$ to be p.r. recognizable. So let $[\alpha,\delta]$ be such a gap. We show that $\alpha$ is p.r. recog. and variants of the argument suffice for the other ordinals in the gap. Then $\alpha < \delta < \alpha^* <\beta_0$. Using (un)/pairing functions (which are p.r.) etc. one has that the closure of $\{\alpha\}$ under p.r. functions includes all ordinals up to $\alpha^*$. So let $F$ be a p.r. function, with $F(\alpha)=\delta’$ for some $\delta’\in (\delta,\alpha^*)$. Let $A=A(\delta’)$. Let: $G(\xi) = 1$ if $L_{F(\xi)+1}\vDash A$; $G(\xi) = 0$ otherwise. Then $G$ witnesses that $\alpha$ is p.r. recognizable, so we are done. Q.E.D. (The definition of $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ is that given in Gro-Tsen's second formulation of question, in terms of the Veblen function (if I understand the terms correctly).) 

The isomorphism is encoded by the permutation of the marker graphs $G_i$. The procedure goes into recursion only, if the marked graphs are still isomorphic. Thus, an isomorphism is found whenever the largest depth of recursion is reached. At each level of recursion at most $n$ graph isomorphy tests are performed. As we have $n$ levels, the delay between the outputs of two isomorphisms is about $O(n^2)$ times the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem of the marked graph, which is polynomial as shown above. Note: There are much more effective ways of marking the nodes than in this example. Edit: It is easy to see that a polynomial delay algorithm is polynomial iff its output is polynomial. 

My reading of this question was different from Andreas', because Norman asked for order preserving maps of the indiscernibles to extend to embeddings $j:L[U]_\theta \rightarrow$ $L[U] _\theta$ i.e. the indiscernibles should be below $\theta$ as the ordinal height of the structures mentioned is $\theta$? In that case the measurable or Ramsey above $\theta$ only guarantees indiscernibles above $\theta$ and so "missing the target"? In any case there are generalisations of "double mice" that you surmise that provide a positive answer. Let $M$ be the "least" in a certain canonical well-ordering of all such iterable structure that have a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ which is, in $M$, the limit of measurables cardinals below $\kappa$. (Such structures are called "mice".) By Loewenheim Skolem we may assume that $M$ is countable. `Iterability' here means we may form all iterated ultrapowers of the first structure $M=M_0$ using this top measure repeatedly; call the ultrapower structures $M_\tau$ for all ordinal $\tau$; then all the $M_\tau$ will be wellfounded. In the $\tau$'th model let $\kappa_\tau$ be the top-most measurable cardinal. Then $\tau ,\mu \rightarrow \kappa_\tau<\kappa_\mu$ and the class of all such $\kappa_\tau$ forms a closed unbounded class of indiscernibles for the model $W$ "left behind" by these iterates. [Fornally $W = \bigcup _ \tau H(\kappa_\tau)^{M_\tau}$.] Then $W$ is the `least' inner model with a proper class of measurables cardinals, (because as $\tau$ increases the order type of the measurables in the models $M_\tau$ increases; but these measures are left behind in the lower $H(\kappa_\tau)^{M_\tau}$ part of the model that goes into $W$). The $\kappa_\tau$ are indiscernibles for it, just as the Silver indiscernibles are for $L$. The large cardinal assumption is then that "This iterable $M$ exists" just as a parallel to "$0$-sharp exists" is to $L$. 

Provable facts Statement 1 If $≤$ is a linear order then $(G,∙,≤)$ is a right ordered group. Suppose that for some $x,y,z∈G$, $x≠y$ the conditions $x≤y$ and $xz\not≤yz$ are true. The latter can be rewritten to $yz≤xz$ as $≤$ is a linear order. Then we know that either $xy^{-1}≤1$ or $1≤xy^{-1}$ is true. Multiplying the latter with $y$ leads to $y≤x$ which is a contradiction to $x≠y$. Thus we know $xy^{-1}≤1$. Multiplying this inequality from the right side with $yz$ leads to $xz≤yz$. Thus $(G,∙,≤)$ is right ordered. A remark to 2) from Boris' answer: An arbitrary order extension may change global properties, such as being a right partially ordered group. In fact a linear order defines that also those elements must be comparable with $1$ that have been incomparable. Thus, there are many ways to violate Xodaraps conditions. Statement 2 If $≤$ is the intersection of linear orders that fulfil Xodaraps conditions then $(G,∙,≤)$ is a right partially ordered group. By Statement 1 each linear order is a right ordered group. If $x≤y$ holds, then this condition is true in all of the other linear order extensions. Then in all of these extensions we get $xz≤yz$, thus this inequality is preserved by the intersection. Other remarks Searching the internet after “right lattice ordered groups” reveals some articles about “half lattice ordered groups”. This looks very promising in order to find an example of a group that fulfils the conditions but is not an $\ell$-group. The terms “partially ordered” and “ordered” are used synonymous as well as “linearly ordered” and “ordered”, depending on the focus of the author and context. 

The answer to Q2 is 'No'. Suppose $j:L\rightarrow L$ is a non-trivial elementary embedding. We use the following fact: $\bullet$ $cp(j)$ (the first ordinal moved by $j$) is always a Silver indiscernible. Now let $I$ be the class of Silver indiscernibles, and $\delta \in I$ but $j(\delta)\notin I$ for a contradiction. Let $H$ be the Skolem hull in $L$ of $j(\delta)\cup j$''$I\backslash (\delta +1)$. $H$ is isomorphic to $L$. If $j(\delta)\notin H$ but $\pi:H \rightarrow L$ is the transitive collapse, then $\pi^{-1}:L\rightarrow L$ is non-trivial with critical point $j(\delta)$. Hence, by the Fact, $j(\delta)$ must be in $H$. Then we see that for some $\vec \xi <j(\delta)$ some $\overrightarrow{j(\zeta)} > j(\delta)$ with $\vec \zeta \in I\backslash (\delta +1)$ that $L \models $ ''$\exists \vec \xi < j(\delta)( j(\delta) = t(\vec \xi ,\overrightarrow{j(\zeta)}))$''. for some term $t$. But then: $L \models $ ''$\exists \vec \xi < \delta( \delta = t(\vec \xi, \overrightarrow{\zeta}))$'' is a definition of the indiscernible $\delta$ from larger indiscernibles and smaller ordinals, which is impossible. (This works for the variant of the question, taking embeddings between sets, if $\alpha, \beta$ are limit ordinals.) 

As the comments point out there is no general algorithm to enumerate possibly exponentially many isomorphisms. Nevertheless, you can enumerate the isomorphisms in polynomial delay, which means that the time spent between two outputs is polynomial in the size of the graph. A rough estimation can be done using the following algorithm to find all isomorphisms from graph $A$ to graph $B$: Preparation: Enumerate all nodes with numbers from $1$ to $n$ and assign for each node a Graph $G_i$ that is a circle with $n+1$ nodes and has $i$ spikes (additional nodes that are directly connected to the circle. Thus these graphs $G_i$ are paiwise nonisomorphic. For each $G_i$ mark a connecting node. We mark a node in graph $A$ or $B$ by connecting this node to the connecting node of $G_i$. As we use two copies of $G_i$ (one for $A$ and one for $B$) we denote them with $G_i^A$ and $G_i^B$. If every node of $A$ is marked by a distinct graph $G_i^A$ and every node of $B$ is marked by a distinct graph $G_i^B$ these graphs are planar as $G_i^J$ is planar and connected by only one edge. Each of these graphs has $O(n^2)$ nodes. Thus, checking if they are isomorphic is polynomial in the size of $A$. Enumeration:
