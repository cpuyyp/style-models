As colossus pointed out, technology advance is not associated with Unemployment. Malthus argued upon scarcity, but he has been proved wrong. As you hold an undergraduate economics degree, you might already know that economics "best friend" is history. There's no reason to talk about a future technology boom, as we have already experienced it. There's not any similar technology boom in history from that of 20th-21th century. Not even close. Also, Marx has been proved wrong on this subject. Austrians have worked extensively against Marxist Theory (most notably F.A. Hayek and L. von Mises). About the political tendencies and the left. After WW2, Greece and Korea suffered a civil war between communists and non-communists. Koreas' split is well known, but people do not know much about Greece. In Greece the communists lost, but the implications were tremendous. Left parties (socialists) abused communist ideals and they deindustrialised the economy. Also, they created class conflicts and massive statism was in favor. They created an economy full of rigidities and inefficiency. They gave tremendous power to unions and they abolished any concept entrepreneurship. Some Greek quick facts: 

To be honest I don't quite understand the question, but it's here for a week so I'll give a short explanation of CAPM. The CAPM is an attempt to explain the risk and return on an asset i.e. it is a risk/return analysis. I don't understand why do we need to transform beta in first place. The CAPM Formula is the following: $E(R_i)=r_f+β_i[E(R_m)-r_f]$ $(1)$ or $(R_{it}-R_{ft})=α_i+β_i(R_{mt}-R_{ft})+ε_i$ $(2)$ Where, 

There was abundant oil supply and the developed countries were splurging on FDI and debt in the periphery Greece had just joined the Euro and was getting tons of transfer payments The Euro was still fairly high and hadn't fallen yet. Greece may have fudged its numbers a bit to get into the Euro. 

The First World mainly holds its assets in equities. The Third World holds its assets in debt. Equities have a higher return. Thus, the First World can run deficits indefinitely by selling it's assets and still gain wealth. Even if the First World net international investment position becomes negative, this is irrelevant, because it's assets will continue to return a higher yield than the Third World's. 

It would undoubtedly be India, as enormous segments India's tertiary educated class come to the US to work as programmers for 120k. $URL$ 

You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Workers under capitalism are paid a wage less than the use-value of what they produce, with the remainder going to surplus value. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value 

Rate of depreciation = depreciation/gross stock in the current year. So 1.7%. Strictly speaking there is no way to calculate depreciation because the timing of capital formation is unknown, but capital begins depreciating as soon as it is formed. 

The long story short, I have developed an index based on a certain distribution. Then I aligned NYSE stocks according to this index i.e. the stocks with the best fit are first and the worst are last. The index is irrelevant with economic theory. Afterwards, I created a group of portfolios with equal number of stocks and equal observations and then I calculated the minimum variance per portfolio. The result suggests that the portfolios with better fit have lower variances than the ones with "bad" fit. Does this prove market inefficiency assuming that it didn't occur just by chance? Edit: According to efficient market hypothesis, asset prices reflect all information given and "patterns" should not occur. However, according to the results, patterns occur and they are independent to the information given. 

$URL$ As you can see in the graph, price controls policies create excess demand, therefore you will end up with shortage or you will import more bananas. I'm not a banana expert, but I assume bananas are pretty inelastic. Also, banana supply is inelastic in the short run (they have already planted bananas), therefore the excess demand will be less than the graph shows. Whatever the case, price control policies generate deadweight loss and it depends on the elasticities who loses more (consumer vs supplier). This market is no longer efficient and that impacts the welfare negatively. 

Probably, but it's not visible because a country is usually already in shambles before a default, and data collection for domestic debt crises is poor. Here is a list of defaults: $URL$ Here's some rate data: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ There have been many cases where countries default on only internal debt. Argentina did this. I can't find bond data anywhere. But when it defaulted on domestic debt (1989), inflation went up and the currency fell. Which is pretty much the same as an increase in external interest rates. 

The lack of discounting will make tax discounting more valuable. Assuming that the market accepts this valuation it will mean increased effort toward tax deferral and possibly increased investment rates. Corporations will hold appreciating assets for longer periods to defer taxes, and will forgo some short term gains in favor of increasing the expected future tax defferal items on the balance sheet. In practice agents are supposed to be aware of accounting changes though and derive their own valuation independently of arbitrary rules set by some accounting standard. 

Iran is dumping oil onto the market at about a dollar a barrel. This is boosting the global economy. It is only a temporary phenomenon and the total oil production will begin to fall any time now. Oil is the sole determinant of long run global growth, and real energy prices always rise before recessions. 

First of all, please check the properties of money and keep them in mind. Indeed money is a convention, but nobody forces you to use it. For example, prisoners use ciggarettes as a medium of exchange. But let's assume you are the absolute ruler of a country and you want your people to use your currency. You can either do it by force or you have to give incentives to your citizens. The most important function of a new currency is to hold its value. If let's say my new currency holds value against yen, dollar or euro, then there's no reason for not using it. It's convenient and stable. How to do this? Via monetary and fiscal policy, using gold standard or by giving it prefix value against another stable currency. For example, a bunch of eastern european countries have a prefixed exchange like Bulgaria (check Bulgarian lev in wikipedia). 

Are the arguments pl and pu responsible for the level of decomposition? For example, if I pick $pl = 2$ and $pu = 4$, it will go for 2-4 days/weeks etc and if I go for $pl = 32$ and $pu = 64$ it will decomposes for 32-64 days/weeks/months etc or am I missing something? Thank you in advance 

I'm trying to compare the results of Christiano Fitzgerald bandpass filter with wavelets. I'm familiar with wavelet decompositions in general, but I'm rather new with Christiano Fitzgerald (CF). So far, I have understood that CF is able to decompose the series to trend and cycles and it is also able to decompose the signal in specific time frames as wavelets do. However wavelets operate with a pyramid algorithm where the first level decomposes the signal to mother and father and it finds the 2-4 frequency and the trend. Then, it picks these results and it decomposes them again to find 4-8 and so on. The documentation of mFilter in R states the following for CF: 

Actually, Section 3 of the paper you linked is probably one of the most comprehensive lists you could find of the movers and the shakers with regard to predictive game theory. I know that many of them have both published and working papers addressing these issues. Fudenberg even addresses those specific two topics. A few selections from the paper: 

In this scenario, the uncertainty referred to is captured in the expectation operator over the information set $\Omega$. Notice that the interpretation of $\Omega$ motivates which instruments to use in the estimation. Takeaway: if you want to use Euler equations to motivate GMM, you need some kind of uncertainty. Use uncertainty structure to decide instruments. 

This isn't a matter of statistical packages as much as it is a matter of how to write a program to maximize/minimize a function. You can do this readily in Stata, Matlab, R, Python, etc. No matter what language you use, though, the process is basically the same. You write a function that specifies the functional form your trying to, say, minimize, set the parameters you're optimizing over as the function arguments, then call some built-in minimization routine on that function. Here is a primer for doing this in Stata and here is an introduction for R. Matlab and Python will both be very similar to R, with the primary exception being that you will have to declare the function in a different .m file for Matlab. 

A true labor shortage is when no labor is available for a task at any price. Surely this occurs all of the time if you consider markets that don't exist or could never exist, but has this ever happened otherwise? Has there ever been a situation where a particular type of labor existed, and then dissapeared, leading to a situation where none of the labor in that sector was available at any price? 

Cylical adjustment is simply a trendline based on past GDP. The structural budget balance is the balance with this trend removed. It is similar to seasonal adjustments, except over a longer period. 

More than 100%. Fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money out of thin air, and they typically leverage twenty times over or more. Despite this they still demand free money from the federal reserve and complain about not being able to hit a button on a computer to lend more money during credit crunches. 

Return on assets = net income/assets. ROI = an informal term roughly corresponding to return on starting capital, or net income/starting capital. Starting capital is any money invested in the business. Let's say you take out a 500k mortgage on a home with a 50k downpayment. That means 550k of assets. Net of everything you make a $10000 profit from rental income or whatever. Your ROA is 10k/550k because even though you don't own the home free and clear, the house is still an asset. ROI is a more informal term comparing how much you invested versus the return. In this example ROI is 10k/50k because you only paid 50k for the home.
