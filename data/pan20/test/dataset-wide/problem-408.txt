Its an intentional anachronism. Our antihero considers himself a puckish rogue, or is obsessed with early 20th century noir cinema. Smoking isn't an affection in its own right - its part of the image our gunslinger has, maybe he wears a cowboy hat and has a sixshooter in an era of high capacity, caseless ammunition, or wears a suit. He knows those deathsticks can kill him, but so can his lifestyle. He knows its not the bullet with his name on it that'll get him, its the one that is addressed "To who it may concern". A good example of this in fiction would be Lester Tourville, whose tendancy to smoke cigars (under the air intake!) was seen as an eccentricity which was part of his wider public persona. As part of charecter building - its something for other charecters to remark on (and possibly could be part of a plot - where does he get those damned cancersticks?). 

Something like that would be pretty impressive. (Mythbusters Jato episode. That's what inspired this...) 

I would assume not. Quite simply the logistics would be too complicated. While modern stores do have products that a medieval royal cook would give their right (pick organ) to have, practically most stores would have a limited selection based on demand. For the sake of sanity, lets look at a single class of less than perishible food product - say soft drinks. Most stores would have boring coca cola or pepsi co drinks. That said, I can't buy planet cola (my second favourite drink ever outside random vending machines.). I've never seen irn bru here (I miss irn bru from a short time in the UK). One product is made locally, so clearly its not a matter of transportation. Its a matter of self space, storage space and local laws. A store aimed at british expats would have no issues selling off a stock of marmite. A store in the middle of a traditional indian community might have trouble giving it away. Assuming reasonable shelf lives, and infinite selections of product, the determining factor would be demand, especially in a retail setting. More often than not, 'local' products would make more sense, due to shipping times/cost, and the ability to tailor them to local tastes. Sure you might occasionally find unusual products but the core selection of products is likely to be limited, and demand based rather than supply based. 

Several of these gestalt forms are birthed, three to be exact. One that develops in the sea and becomes a 70 foot sea monster, the original locked deep within the original research facility that gave birth to the Magdalene, and one created by infecting the town adjacent the facility. These eventually merge together into the final beast; a 150 foot long salamander-esque monstrosity. The story and processes behind all this still need s few kinks worked out, and the science is more than likely unsound, but when I originally envisioned the story I wanted to create a type realistic and hard science take on Kaiju and giant monsters, which leads to the main questions. 

The problem is Magdalene batch #001 is ineffective in long term treatment, as they tend to die too quickly to successfully kill the cancer, batch #002 was developed to be longer living and more aggressive and was created using the rare mutated cancer cells of the main researchers deceased former colleague, and wife. Her last wish was for her body be used for scientific research that may one day make the world a better place. This new Magdalene variant was hyper aggressive and was designed with a genetic kill switch that would activate in case the organisms ate more than what was intended. However over time batch #002 evolved and mutated, figuring out a way around the kill switch, leading to them going out of control, multiplying and absorbing bio matter at a ravenous rate. Now that we know exactly what they are, lets break down their life cycle and how this colony eventually evolves into the larger forms. 

I'd have a differentiation between rockets, torpedos and missiles in terms of how they are flown. Rockets would be unguided weapons - cheap, short range and fired en-masse, deathblossom style. Missiles would be guided systems with propulsion throughout their flight time, and active thrust controls. They'd be roughly equivilent to a modern day air to air or surface to air missile. I'd see these as weapons used to take down fighter to "gunship"/corvette class ships or fun emplacements. One of the interesting things about space combat is distance. A torpedo makes a ton of sense as a long range missile, that's launched from railguns or with a booster, coasts into range then goes into active attack mode. They'd need less propellant for their weight, generally get deployed in the early stages of an attack, and tend to be massive shipkillers. Something like the missile systems in the honorverse comes to mind, though they're an evolution of single stage missles as I've described here. How they're used would be the interesting thing here - rockets would be used in massive numbers to overwhem mount defences or shields. Missiles would be tailored for dogfights and short range combat.Torpedos would be used tactically - predeployed, coasting towards a planned engagement area, and then getting activated later. Combat with torpedos as such would revolve around avoiding or destroying enemy torpedos before they can do any damage, while trying to herd the enemy into your kill zone. 

First the Magdalene are injected directly into the patients body. The Magdalene will then congregate on the cancerous region and began to devour the cancerous cells, and then die shortly after. 

How sound (or unsound) is the science behind what I'm purposing here? What exactly can I do add some verisimilitude to the story and concept? 

I'm currently working on a story treatment for a monster story. The story is sort of a love letter to many different genres and classic tropes employed and made famous by, John Carpenter, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, and George Romero. With a heavy dose of Ishiro Honda's early work with Tokusatsu films, such as the original Godzilla. I'll try to do a quick rundown that will hopefully shed light on the main antagonist of the story, The Magdalene. The creature is a large amphibious monster that can best be described as a 150 foot long Salamander who's body seems to be composed entirely of horrific cancerous tumors, and suffering from a full body bruise, as its skin is sickly and black looking. The creature started out as a collection of micro organisms made from cancer cells, and originally conceived by a multinational research project in hopes of creating a cure for cancer. How this works is simple...sort of. 

The Magdalene begin to multiply and spread the already existing cancer throughout the victims body, causing them to grow large horrific tumors all over their bodies, which the Magdalene will then feed on and grow. Overtime they completely replace the victims cells with the aberration Magdalene cells. The infected hosts are taken control by a specially evolved Magdalene type that acts in a similar way the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis fungus does with carpenter ants, manipulating the victims bodily functions to use as a platform to which they can use to consume more bio-matter. After a suitable amount of bio-matter has been consumed and integrated into the hosts, they will eventually converge on each other and merge together on the cellular level, creating a gargantuan gestalt organism that has a Deadpool-esque healing factor based on the fact it's a waking cancer beast.
