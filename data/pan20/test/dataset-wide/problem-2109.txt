Rather than look at overall employee-friendly, why not focus on which department you'd be working? Some companies may be good overall but have some departments that are quite poor and would you accept that trade-off,e.g. while the sales guys are treated like rock stars, IT people are trampled over and you are in the IT department? The predicting the future of hard times and increasing benefits would be ones where unless you want to work for a forecasting company, how good is anyone at knowing what will come down the road? As for salary to pressure, I'd be more tempted to suggest you consider what values does the organization have. Do they work hard, play hard? Do they seem fairly laid back? I'd highly suggest writing out what factors you have in your next company. What industry should it be? What stage of growth should it be? How long should people work there? Is it mostly life-long employees or do most people use it as a stepping stone for something else? There are lots of questions like this to help nail down what kind of environment you want and would be my suggestion along with talking to people to build the network that lets you find the companies that suit your work style. 

What if in taking the short-term job, you then have access to the internal job postings that can be applied as you are a temporary employee of the company? What if you could see the jobs that don't have dozens of applicants as it is intended to be filled internally? Just something to consider for a potential positive here. 

I'd likely ask the recruiter why the schedule shift, where the key is to see if there is a standard answer like, "Oh, the hiring manager was sick that day," or something similar where there is a chance that things happen, but it can still leave a bit of a bitter taste in one's mouth. Avoiding them may well not be that possible as "life happens" and things may get rescheduled. I can remember years ago that I had a recruiter tell me about a job where I supposed to show up on my first day of work without any interview or even knowing the company name and that got rescheduled twice and eventually dropped but it showed me how unprofessional some recruiters could be at times. Who hires someone without at least having some form of conversation? Something to consider is what kind of recruiters are you using: Are they big companies with dozens of people looking to place applicants or is it a few person company that would have only a few resources to find people? It could be worthwhile seeing which kinds of recruiting firms you prefer and stay in touch with the ones that you don't have issues. 

My suggestion would be to consider a modified behavioral interview inquiring about conflict resolution, management style, and general work style. So, while you would ask for an example of where someone had to convince someone to take another route on resolving an issue, there could also be the question of what would be done differently and what was learned in having that experience that could be useful. I would highly suggest knowing what kind of work culture and atmosphere you have so that you can articulate it to the possible new team leads as well as be prepared to discuss how are things handled in the organization. 

Observe the cat and if it looks ill, bring the cat to a vet to have it examined. Feed the cat with the proper cat food, make sure it has access to water, clean the litter box every 2-3 days, brush the cat's fur, clip the cat's nails and on top of that if the cat looks ill, take the cat to the vet. 

For the full time job case, there is a percentage of your annual salary that the client would pay the recruiting firm for a permanent hire. For example, if the job paid $60,000/year the client may pay 30% of that salary or $18,000 for the hire. Note that there may be passing a probationary period here so that it isn't just an automatic payment when you start on day one. For a contracting case, there is a percentage of the rate that the company would take. In this case, you may be paid $30/hour but the client is paying more than that and the recruitment firm is pocketing the difference mostly. For this scenario, the longer the contract is there the more money they make and thus this is usually what some firms may prefer to do. At least this is my understanding in North America for how this works. 

Yes, it is a gap if you don't account for what you did for those 6 years. Were you in prison, hospital or something else for that time? Were you doing secret government missions that you can't disclose? Gap means missing time here. If you take much longer than usual to complete an educational program, some may view that as an education gap,e.g. if you spend 7 years to get a Bachelor's degree that is usually completed in 4-5 years. On the other hand, if you were working before 2004 then it may be seen as a career gap as one could wonder what work did you do. The question is what perspective is being applied to the time: Were you supposed to be in school, working or both? 

I'd say it is unusual to contact them, yes. If you are merely looking at their profile on the site, this isn't the same as contact to my mind. At the same time, if you are at a networking event and run into a future interview person then this can be quite good to have an opportunity to get to know the person outside of the office to some extent. Similarly if you run into someone that you had an interview a week or two ago, it can be useful to catch up on things. 

If the company is fairly small, there isn't likely to be a lot of HR formalities in terms of career path and progression. The better question is what parts of the development cycle appeal to you? What is the status of that big project as sometimes it can be useful to jump in and see where things go. There is something to be said for developers sometimes taking on various roles which can range from gathering requirements to babysitting servers. There is part of this that is normal. Now, if you want to suggest that where you work be a bit more formalized in terms of tracking bugs, feature requests and so forth so that you can know what work is coming, that may be a fair request though this is something to talk to your boss and co-workers to see what is being used and how is that going. The value of certain technologies will vary from location as well as within industry. For example, Oil and Gas companies may not care to prototype a low-power embedded system used to track wildlife. Similarly, I can wonder how many technologies are you wanting to get into since some technologies can be quite broad as they have various uses. For example, within .Net there are various components of the platform like WCF, WPF, ASP.Net, WF and CardSpace without looking at what's new in 4.5 that may add to this group of tools. 

Could you look at this from the flip side? What is the financial health of the company? If the salary freeze was to keep the company afloat, then the raises may well be small ones as if you haven't seen any change in 4 years there could be the idea that a small raise of maybe a couple percent may be enough to prevent others from leaving. Not to be cynical here but what kind of position are you expecting your employer to take here? While I'd agree that there could be some discussion that because of the time, responsibility changes and other stuff you may want a bigger raise, there is a question of what can the company really do. 

Personally, I wouldn't. I would suggest finding mentors outside of those direct superiors you have that may be more useful to have as sounding boards. There is the potential that when it comes to office politics you aren't doing well enough to be the person that is getting favored and thus you feel a little bitter. Depending on the size of your organization, there may be others in management positions that you could ask for a perspective of how are you seen by others as it may be that the company wants to have you do some technical work while also calling you a manager so that you aren't the low man on the totem pole.
