Awesome question, the only person I've been able to dig out of my brain with ideas like these is William James. He starts by saying nearly the same thing you're saying, 

Deny 1 and say that a moral theory can permit evil and still be right. This is kinda hard to do, if you ask me, but might be tempting for something like Virtue Theorists to say (e.g. a virtuous person needn't always do the right thing, they should just be a good person most of the time). If you're coming at this as a Consequentialist, however, it might be better to leave 1 alone. You can dig in your heels and deny that Consequentialism permits evil actions. After all, consequentialism does provide a criterion for moral rightness - it's just that deontologists (or whatever) feel at odds with what it labels moral and immoral. However, butting heads over moral criteria is just frustrating for both parties, and I don't advise it. 

When we say formal we mean "of or relating to logical form as opposed to function or meaning" (ty Google dictionary). A formal definition is one which relates the subject matter to some statement of logic. For instance is a logical statement. If we define then we have a formal definition of . It's even formal to say that - this is known as the empty function. Even simple operations like addition are functions! Expressions, which utilize operators, cannot exist, except as free-floating numbers or symbols. This helps to explain why so many posters have focused on relating this back to functions: without the concept of a function (which is formal and well-defined by definition) it is impossible to do what you and I would call "math" - all that remains is free-floating numbers, whose definitions are no more "mathematical" than are the definitions of bachelors or garbage trucks. I'd be curious to hear an example of a definition which is mathematical but not formal, but as of now I don't think it's possible, given what we mean by mathematical and what we mean by formal. 

At that point, you can either argue that deontology is wrong by its very nature, or that it's actually the same thing as consequentialism. A great example is "Should I lie to protect innocent people from Nazis despite the supposed moral fact saying that it's wrong to lie?" Sometimes deontology veers dangerously close to absolutism, which is something you can and should hammer them for because it's really hard to defend. Modern deontologists often see the need to back up deontology with other philosophical doo-dads that make it weaker in the end. Frances Kamm's "Principle of Permissible Harm" is a good example - it essentially adds in a consequentialist element to deontology which kinda defeats the point of having this discussion. Even without this, you can also hammer deontologists on why a certain thing is wrong. Ask them why it's wrong to kill puppies, for instance. They'll give you a long answer relating to something Kant said, but if you iterate and ask why we have a duty to do X or how our intentions have to be in the right place, a lot of people will eventually say, "Look, it's just wrong! It hurts the puppy and that's bad!" At that point, you've got them pinned. 

It's a really frustrating argument to rebut, hopefully I've laid it out in at least a comprehensible way. 

Explanatory vs. Descriptive Accounts of History Explanatory accounts are tricky. There can be shades of truth to explanations, while descriptions are easier to falsify. For instance, consider the following explanatory accounts of the Russian Revolution: 

I can't for the life of me remember who originally argued this or find the article through Google search, but @Conifold hinted at it above: mathematics is inextricably related to the physical world we inhabit and thus is not necessarily a priori true. Imagine a world where all matter behaved like some sort of fluid, down to a molecular level. Assume the physical laws of this universe are drastically different. Would inhabitants of this world hold the same truths that we hold about math without rigid shapes or strictly defined objects? Would they have a priori knowledge of polygons? Would triangles ever even cross their minds? It even seems dubious that without the nifty feature where matter clumps together in our universe that we'd even have the same understanding of how numbers work. Food for thought, I guess. 

I think what the others are getting at is this: in science there is no disagreement over the facts, only the theory. If we take coin-flipping to be a form of science, and we flip coins repeatedly with a group of scientists present, everyone will agree about a few basic things like how many heads they observed or what class of material the coin is made of. The problem of disagreement comes when they learn more about the world from this experiment. Some of our scientists might develop a theory: that if this coin is fair, it should fall on heads as often as tails in the limiting case. Some others might notice that the coin was flipped 50 times and argue that the coin is likely biased, as it fell on heads 35 times instead of 25. Some may say that this is reasonably unlikely, and thus proves the coin's bias, while others might say we need to flip more to come to a conclusion. Others might attempt to model the coin's behavior to understand the laws that govern its motion. These models will likely have varying degrees of accuracy and depend on other variables like the exact chemical composition of the coin - leading the chemists of the group to experiment with samples of the coin to understand its nature. Others still will wonder what in the world I'm flipping a coin for and will seek to analyze my role, or even their own as a member of this social process, theorizing about our underlying motivations for performing these acts when there are other groups who care nothing for the behavior of coins. I could really go on and on here but hopefully you've got the point - theories are the subject of disagreement, not the base level facts. Theories are falsifiable but not provable (by definition) - there can be no theory in science immune to the possibility of future rejection. Thus, the disagreements are often along the lines of whether a theory has been falsified, or sometimes whether the theory is falsifiable or not. 

Certainly. Simply knowing the definition of the word, or even knowing the "right" thing to do in every circumstance and also knowing there is a compelling reason to do the right thing in every circumstance does not necessarily force a person into a life of moral actions without adequate moral reasoning. 

God is the greatest being that could ever be imagined, and we can imagine Him and some things about what he must be like (omnipotent, omipresent, etc.). Part of being great is really existing. Imagine me telling you about greatest poker player ever, like this guy is nearly psychic, he wins every hand, never flinches, is adored by poker players everywhere. However, if I told you he wasn't real, and instead is just a character in a book that I'm writing, you'd be a bit let down. Clearly he's not really the greatest if he doesn't exist. If God only exists as an idea in the mind, if he is just a figment of imagination, or a character in a book, then he is not maximally great! He could be greater if he actually existed. Else, he would be like our fictitious super-poker-player - a bit of a let down. This contradicts the concept of God being maximally great - being the greatest being that could be imagined. Surely a God who really exists, who really parts the seas, really floods the Earth in wrath, really turns water into wine is greater than some story. Thus 3. must be wrong, and God must exist. 

Both of these statements are explanatory and falsifiable. There was no emperor Donald Trump, nor did he enact a one-child policy, and historical accounts attest to this. The second is much more believable, yet no less falsifiable - it is possible that some Russian polling agency asked the public their opinion of Tsarism vs. Bolshevism or that, statistically speaking, the military of Tsarist Russia was too weak to adequately handle a violent, politically motivated terrorist group from overcoming the government. The important characteristic of good explanatory theories of history is that they can be reasonably falsified. For instance, the American revolution was surely influenced by Enlightenment philosophy from Hobbes and Locke: this similarity can be seen in the writings of America's founding fathers. Notable examples include Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George Washington, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. If one were to test the hypothesis that these thinkers were more influenced by Islam, the artwork of Brunelleschi, and Native American Shamanism, the evidence is exceedingly shallow and tangential. While it's not as cut and dried as falsifying the notion that the American founding fathers were all Rastafarians who rode mutant horses into battle against the British, it can be done. What is the purpose of history outside of solely cataloguing interesting events? This question is harder to answer, but may be informed by my response to the prior question regarding the value of explanatory accounts of history. Since I've established that falsifiable explanatory theories of history are at least conceivable (thus possible), it follows that there is some value in working toward an explanatory model of the "arc of history". It is important to understand which thoughts and theories influenced real political movements so that we can understand how our world came to be, both from a theoretical/philosophical perspective and a realistic and descriptive perspective. While such explanations may not be necessary to understand how history has progressed, they may help to show us why history has progressed in the way that it has. RE: Marx, Hegel: Marx's theories may be more falsifiable than you're letting on. Marx made explicit predictions about how the industrial revolution would pan out - and to this day hasn't been so correct in predicting that workers would seize the means of production from the elites to create a socialist utopia (this may be a bit simplistic, but was present in his writings). Personally, I don't think either of these philosophers deserve much credit, in part because their explanations were unclear and their projections of the future were not realized. Last words: Political theory is an iffy subject, often mixing descriptive historical accounts with moral philosophy, statistics, and social science. As a student of philosophy and history, it is important to not only ask how things happened, but why --and to develop theories that adequately (and falsifiably) address both of these points. 

A couple thoughts on this whole conversation: Indian Philosophy is not "Taboo" There are specific courses available on Indian philosophy at most U.S. universities - Indian philosophy is not on the same level of taboo as Divination or Alchemy. In fact, one of the philosophy profs at my school (a relatively average, white, male philosophys PhD) specialized in it! It's definitely a current in scholarly thought, though it's not the focus of contemporary philosophy. In modern philosophy, it's no more "taboo" to discuss Indian philosophy than it is to discuss zombies, trolleys killing masses of people, or super-intelligent computers. It is taboo, however, to assert "The world is this way" in any philosophical discussion and then to claim there is a bias against you when people inquire as to why you believe that. From your comments, it appears this is a trap you are falling into, and it doesn't have to be that way! Philosophy is a sport only for the inquisitive, the respectful, and the open-minded - people with strong preconceived notions or beliefs that can't fully be explained often get frustrated. There is not only a single reason for this, as others have noted. Below are some reasons: The Western World is Largely Concerned with a Single Branch of Philosophy That Is Also Highly Western It is true that the West is rather "egocentric" about our own contributions to philosophy. It is also true that we're excited about analytic philosophy, something that India is not well known for (nor is any country, prior to the last couple of centuries). We love logic and argument and proof and debate just about anything. This branch of philosophy is motivated largely by Enlightenment era thinking and modern science - two (largely) Western artifacts themselves! Because of this strange obsession, we're unable to pit many of India's great, ancient thinkers against today's analytic philosophers - it's not a fair fight in terms of what they know or how they make their arguments. The same is true of Aristotle - while he was undoubtedly a great thinker, he was simply wrong about some stuff, and that's ok - we still like him! We just don't take our beliefs about everything from him, especially when other thinkers have improved on his arguments. NOTE: People from all over the world contribute to science despite differing backgrounds and beliefs. It's dumb for me to insinuate this is not the case. Religion And Philosophy Mix Poorly It is also true that Indian philosophy is closely related to Indian religion. Because of this, many philosophers prefer to leave this branch of philosophy for religious scholars and experts to research. The same is true of other religious ideas as well. Outside of "Philosophy of Religion" classes, Christian philosophy is rarely, if ever, discussed, despite the fact that Christianity is a huge part of the Western tradition. The reason is largely the same as with Indian philosophers or Aristotle: Christian philosophers of yore just don't know as much about the world as we currently do and some of their arguments rest on faulty assumptions. Furthermore, religions often require a degree of faith or belief contrary to evidence that is not conducive to the act of "doing philosophy". Preconceived notions like these are widely regarded as counterproductive to debate and truth-seeking. It's worthy of note that in my experience in philosophy, Judeo-Christian ethics, beliefs, and worldviews receive far more scrutiny, far more disagreement and far more time and attention than does Indian philosophy - which most people in the West simply know little about. 

A good (yet silly) example of this comes from TV sitcoms - it's common for the lovable, well-meaning characters to know what is the right thing to do and to really want to do the right thing but fail hilariously because of their own irrationality in sizing up situations. I'd argue that this is the most sensible theory of how immorality usually works in the wild (i.e. no maniacal dictators, no sociopaths, etc.): people know what the right thing to do is and know that being moral is better than being immoral, but can't put two and two together to realize that they are in a situation where their moral reasoning is important. Instead, people act off of impulse, necessity, or short-sightedness, short-circuiting they reasoning process with heuristics that provide "easy answers" to the moral quandaries life demands them to solve (often on short time frames).
