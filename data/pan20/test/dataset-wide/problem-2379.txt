There is no love in attachment. Whenever attachment is present in the mind, there is no love in that mind. Why is that so? Attachment comes from clinging. Clinging comes from craving. Craving comes from willing. Willing comes from ignorance. From ignorance comes suffering. Thus, there is no love in attachment. Attachment is suffering. The more a mind is permeated with attachment, the more there is no love in that mind. There is love in non-attachment. Whenever non-attachment is present in the mind, there is love in that mind. Why is that so? Non-attachment comes from non-clinging. Non-clinging comes from non-craving. Non-craving comes from non-willing. Non-willing comes from wisdom. From wisdom comes liberation from suffering. Thus, there is love in non-attachment. Non-attachment is love. The more a mind is permeated with non-attachment, the more there is love in that mind. 

If meditation is done properly, kamma starts to unwind. When kamma is unwinding, visions arise. When visions arise, let them arise. When you let them arise, experience them. When you experience them, don't cling on them or be afraid of them. If you won't cling on them or be afraid of them, visions will cease and awakening will not be far away. Visions during sitting meditation are signs of being on the right path towards awakening and final liberation. 

Living is a consequence of birth. Everything is unstable, unsatisfying and out of control because of birth. Birth is a consequence of not knowing what is suffering, what is the cause of suffering, what is the end of suffering and what is the way leading to the end of suffering. 

Samsara and its beings can be eternal or not eternal or both. All these views, given the right conditions, are correct. No action is pointless. They all lead to nirvana. Every action has good, bad or neutral consequences. Every consequence, can give rise to new knowledge. Every future "I" is reborn based on the knowledge the current "I" has. It's because of these truths that every "I", on a long term, consistently increases his knowledge. When knowledge increases enough, the truths are realized and future births are stopped. No action is pointless. They all lead to nirvana.

I'm wondering WHY a strong belief in rebirth does not conform with the above Buddha's teachings? I really want to understand the WHY behind it. WHY a belief in rebirth does not lead to the cessation of suffering? WHY somebody who strongly accepts rebirth (read the below case to see what I mean by "strongly accepting rebirth") can't attain Nibanna? Please respond to the below questions that I provided and then if you wish give your explanations/answers. 

Mindfully observe your thoughts arising and ceasing until they leave of their own accord. Do step 1 until you mindfully observe: "There are no thoughts arising in me". Once you note that your mind is completely stilled, proceed to the next step. Mindfully and slowly arise a thought, for example arise a visualization of an object. Observe how the thought visualization of the object arises. Then, mindfully and slowly let go of this same thought visualization of the object. Observe how the thought visualization of the object ceases. Repeat the process. The key here is mindfulness. 

Feeling offended comes from suffering. Whenever you are offended, it is because of craving or clinging within you. Feeling offended comes from within you, not outside you. When you completely stop craving and clinging, suffering ceases. Feelings of being offended do not arise any more. To answer your question, a Buddhist should not feel offended by anything. He who is offended, should search deeper within to find the truth of his suffering. 

You can't remember past lives. Memory comes from your 5 senses. With death, your 5 senses cease to exist. When your 5 senses cease to exist, memory ceases to exist. You can only observe the truth within and outside you, and with your observation you can deduct or reconstruct your past lives. It's like being a flower, not knowing who you are, observing, and then you realize: "oh I'm a flower, I came from a seed, it was carried by a bee, it came from another flower. This is who I was. Now I am here". As you can see, this is not memory, but pure observation. In the same way as a flower, you can observe and realize: "oh I was a bird, I was suffering. Then I was a hunter in a forest, I was very angry. Then I was a farmer, I worked here and there, I was happy. Then I was... etc. This is who I was. Now I am here." 

To claim that this process stops after the complete annihilation of the physical body is incorrect. This process doesn't magically stop after the complete annihilation of the physical body. Why it doesn't just stop?

When verbally denying something, in reality he would not be denying it nor accepting it. When verbally accepting something, in reality he would not be accepting it nor denying it.

Given that the author in prior verses says that there actually is no "I" for whom to be compassionate, the only possible interpretation of the above answer can be this: 

I'll answer as I was once told by a Buddha: When a being is born, that being, no matter where it is born, no matter for how many aeons he would live, a day would come, when he would have to die. And why is that so? Suppose a king, due to good kamma, after death, can choose the duration of his life and the universe he is born in. Suppose he decides to be immortal and be born in an universe without any beings. Thus he is born in an universe where no beings can harm him and is immortal. He lives like that for many many aeons. He delights in his immortality. He is the all knowing king, eternal king of the universe. Then, he wakes one day, and sees a being! He asks: "Being! How did you come into my universe?!" The being answers: "Because I made the wish." Then, after many aeons, that being dies. Then, after many aeons, the king wakes one day, and sees a being again! "Being! How did you come into my universe?!" he asks. "Because I made the wish." the being replies. The next day, centillions and centillions of beings appear next to the king! "What! Why did you all come into my universe!?" the king asks. The beings reply: "Because he made the wish." and shred the king into pieces. It is correct to say that all phenomena must be impermanent. We know it, because the Buddha says so. Those who don't know, will soon know too ... just like that poor king. 

"Fake it till you make it" is one of many views a disciple could endeavor on his way to liberation. It could be a good way to gain some knowledge/wisdom. Once knowledge/wisdom is gained, sooner or later one abandons the view "fake it till you make it". You have done right by not restraining your last public display of emotion. Even if that emotion was coming from your ego, it should not be avoided. The reason the emotion came is to learn why it came. The whole universe is here for you to see the path leading to liberation. Even if you probably don't see it this way, your emotion was one of the many experiences that lead you closer to liberation. 

A = 'not self'. If A = B = C, it follows 'not self' = B = C. Or ... Universe = 'not self'. If universe = mind = body, it follows 'not self' = mind = body. Or ... 'not self' = universe = mind = body Or ... 'not self' = all
