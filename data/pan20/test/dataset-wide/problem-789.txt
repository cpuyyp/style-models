I am wanting to plot a velocity profile (a plot of velocity against the star's distance from the galactic core) from the Gaia DR2, but so far my efforts have been disappointing. The information I have for each star are the declination ($\delta$), right ascension ($\alpha$), radial velocity ($v_r$), parallax ($\theta_\text{parallax}$) and proper motion ($\mu$) (ra and dec). I tried to calculate the star's distance from the galactic core using the cosine rule: $$ d = \frac{1000}{\theta_{\text{parallax}}}$$ $$\theta = \arccos{[\sin{\delta_\text{star}}\sin{\delta_\text{core}} + \cos{\delta_\text{star}}\cos{\delta_\text{core}}\cos{(\alpha_\text{star}-\alpha_\text{core})}]}$$ $$ r = \sqrt{d_\text{core}^2+ d^2 - 2d \times d_\text{core} \times \cos{\theta}} $$ Where $d$ is the distance from the Sun to the star. $d_\text{core}$ is the distance from the Sun to the galactic core. $\theta$ is the angular separation of the star and the galactic core. $r$ is the distance from the star to the core. And the star's speed using the equations: $$\mu = \sqrt{\mu_\text{dec}^2 + \mu_\text{ra}^2}$$ $$ v_t = 4.7 \mu d $$ $$ v = \sqrt{v_r^2 + v_t^2} $$ But the plot doesn't show any kind of trend (just a kind of blob). Have I calculated correctly and, if not, how could I calculate the tangential velocities and radius from the galactic core? Basically, I want to make the kind of plot that helps us identify dark matter in galaxies. 

Nobody has been able to find an answer how anybody may be able to see the inner organs of the human body as Natalya Demkina is able to see. In this context, I want to mention that the same way as we are able to see things in the light of an electric lamp or the sun-rays even though our eyes don't emit the visible band of the electromagnetic rays may it not be possible for her to see the inner organs of other people because the sun-rays contain X-rays also. According to me, it is wrong to say that since human eyes can't emit X-rays she may not be able to see the inner organs of other persons the same way as we are able to see everything even though our eyes don't emit the visible band of the electromagnetic waves. I want to know whether it may be possible that her brain's circuitry may be allowing her to see the inner organs through the X-ray band of the sun-rays unlike the rest of us or not. The chances of her having some special brain-circuitry of this type can't be ruled out according to me. 

According to me following reason of mass accumulation of earth has been completely overlooked so far. The sunrays that fall on the oceans travel deep into water and finally get converted into mass which eventually results in "mass-accretion of the earth". So earth is continuously getting heavier due to the mass being added to it due to this reason year by year. Therefore, should this also not be one of the reasons why the orbit-time of the earth (time taken by it to take one round of the sun) is bound to change (increase or decrease) with time? 

It is estimated that the sun's core is about 1/5 of the radius of the sun (from Wikipedia). I know that the density of the plasma increases substantially the near the center, and that the volume of the core is 0.008 times the total volume. $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {4/3\pi (0.2)^3}{4/3\pi (1)^3}$$ $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {(0.008)}{(1)}$$ What is the mass of the core compared to the total mass? 

Voyager is traveling at 17 km/s with respect to the sun. Since the sun is orbiting the galaxy, it is likely that Voyager will also orbit the galaxy for 5 billion years or so, until the collision with Andromeda happens. 

The moon orbits the Earth in roughly 29 days. So in 14 days, it would be on the other side of the Earth. 

Is the Milky Way a collection of merged galaxies, or has it only been one galaxy that was created from the interstellar media? 

It would sublimate. The frozen mass of water would decrease in size as the water converts from a solid to a gas (without becoming a liquid) and drifts away. 

This simulation probably gives the best answer. Added: The simulation is a 2 1/2 min video of the creation of a large galaxy from interstellar dust by collecting smaller galaxies. The time span is probably in hundreds of millions of years. 

Where the Y axis is brightness (ranging from 100% to 0%) and the X axis is $d$ (ranging from $2r$ to $0$). I hope this answers your question: the brightness does not change proportionally to coverage/time. Note: This assumes that $d$ increases linearly with time (the moon doesn't speed up or slow down as it moves across the Sun). 

The word we use to refer to what's inside the cosmic horizon is the 'universe', so what would you call the empty space outside of the horizon? 

I've recently become interested in the idea of building my own small-scale radio telescope. A quick online search finds a few instructions on how to build this using a satellite dish. These suggest a dish of radius of around 1 metre, but the only objects that you seem to be able to detect are the Sun, the Earth, the Moon (possibly) and communications satellites. This sounds like it would be become boring fairly quickly, and I would like to observe some deep-sky objects. Some example objects that I fancy observing (depending on how strong their signals are) are Betelgeuse/Sirius, the Crab Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy. N.B. I am quite satisfied with pointing the dish at an object and the signal strength increasing. I don't expect to get any kind of image. Evidently, you cannot pick these up using a metre-wide dish, so what is the minimum size required to pick up these objects (noting that I can't exactly build Arecibo in my back garden)? In case it matters, I live in a rural area, ~5 miles from the nearest town. I originally emailed Jodrell Bank this question but they ignored me :P 

Sometime after 4.5 billion years, the sun will change into a red giant star and expand to about 1 AU. Some people think it will be beyond Earth's orbit. (In any case, Earth's orbit would have changed and likely to have struck the surface of the expanded sun.) The asteroids would experience a stronger solar wind and their orbits would become more elliptical, so Jupiter's influence would be significant. 

If the mass of the star is about 1/4 the mass of our sun, then the core's (where fusion occurs) temperature and pressure will never be enough to fuse anything other than hydrogen into helium. The death of this star may be something like a fire dying. The flames disappear for a while, then you may get one or 2 popping back into existence. Our sun will start to fuse helium into carbon before all the hydrogen in the core is used. In the description of a heavy star, it is described as a onion with its layers with the higher fusion products occurring in the lower layers. They use this model since the iron fusion requires temperature and pressures above a certain level. Neon has lower requirements, but still greater than carbon fusion, and so on. What is not mentioned, is that there is still hydrogen fusion occurring in the center, as well as all the other fusion, helium, carbon, neon, etc. 

Assuming the intensity of the sunlight is proportional to the area of the Sun which is showing, we can roughly calculate the intensity of sunlight, $I(d)$ as: $$I(d) = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}}{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}}}$$ Where $\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}$ is the overlap between the Moon and the Sun (the green area). $URL$ Some calculation finds the overlap to be: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}} = 2r^2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2}\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}$$ Where $d$ is the distance between the centres of the Moon and the Sun. Similarly, the area of the Sun is: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}} = \pi r^2$$ Putting this together, you get the graph: 

Is there a way to take the red shift of an object and, from that, calculate a rough estimate of its distance from us (in parsecs, preferably)? 

In 1.5 million years, the star Gliese 710 is expected to pass through the Oort cloud. Now obviously this will shower the inner solar system with comets, but the Wikipedia page doesn't say anything about the star's impact on the orbits of the planets. Will the star not throw the Earth and other planets into highly elliptical orbits, destroying all life? Or, simply, do we not know because this would involve solving the 11-body problem? 

I want to write a program which, when given a date, a time, latitude and longitude, returns a list of the planets, Messier objects and NCC catalogue objects what are visible in the sky at that time and place? Are there any APIs which can do this or would I have to calculate the positions? Preferably, this should be accessible using JavaScript 

If we convert the mass of all the stars and all the planets which must be weighing trillions and trillions of tonnes by the equation E = m.c^2 it gets converted into an unimaginable amount of energy. Would so much of energy not have gone into the evolution of the Universe? I am at a great suspense whether the Big Bang theory or any other theory at all answers from where so much of energy would have come that would have got converted into so many trillions and trillions of tonnes of the mass of all the galaxies put together. How we can believe in the big-bang-theory unless we know from where so much of energy would have arrived? 

We have been calling the star by looking at which we can make out the direction of the North Pole the North Star. This was the only method at the disposal of the sailors during the days when they did not have any compass with them. When the axis of the earth would point toward Denab, Denab would become the North Star. When it would point toward Vega, Vega would become the North Star. Likewise, when the axis would point toward Thuban, Thuban would become the North Star. When we look at the Polaris from the earth, the Big Bear appears to be revolving around it. So I am curious to know which constellations would appear to be revolving around the Denab, Vega and Thuban when the axis of the earth would be pointing toward them due to wobbling of the earth. 

They are not that rare; there are 4 to 6 solar and lunar eclipses each year with an equal number of each (on average). 

It's not that the neutrino detectors don't have a chance of detecting a neutrino, but that the neutrinos do not interact with matter (well hardly ever). If there are $6.5\times 10^{10}$ neutrinos per second per $cm^2$ and if the detector has an area of $10^{6} cm^2$, and it detects 1 neutrino per year, then 1 out of $2.05\times 10^{24}$ neutrinos interacts with the detector. $2.05\times 10^{24}$ pass through the detector unnoticed. 

How fast does the blast front of a supernova expand at? Is it close to the speed of light or is it less than a quarter of the speed of light? 

For a star to become a nova, it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun. For a supernova, it needs to be larger. The first stage is the hydrogen fusion into heavier elements. The energy created pushes the hydrogen outwards. If there was no fusion, the star would be a low smaller. When the hydrogen fusion in the core slows down (due to a lack of hydrogen), the star shrinks and helium fusion takes over as the main process. At this time, it is believed that the core of the star is about 25% hydrogen and 75% helium. The outer layer of hydrogen doesn't change. Eventually, the star makes iron as a fusion product. The fusion to make an element heavier than iron consumes more energy than what it produces, so when the "iron fusion" (creation of iron) process slows down significantly, the star collapses. This collapse causes a massive pressure and temperature increase in the core, which triggers the fusion of heavier elements; although it is a net loss of energy. This burst of energy blows the star apart. The difference between a nova and a supernova is the amount of fusion that happens before the core is blasted apart. Since fusion only takes place in the core, and the core is less 1/100 the volume of the star, when the star goes nova (or supernova), the outer layer of the star is blown outwards.
