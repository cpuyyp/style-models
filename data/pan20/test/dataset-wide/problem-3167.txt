According to that obscure source, Wikipedia, on 9 May 1936 King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy was proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia. $URL$ Thus I guess that the only empire proclaimed by the Fascist government of Italy on 9 May 1936 was the Italian Empire of Ethiopia. It is unlikely that the Fascists would proclaim 2 empires on the same day. And I have never read of any formal empire of Italy instead of mere informal descriptions of Italian colonial possessions as an empire. Here is the title of Victor Emmanuel III from 1936 to 1939: 

It was often alleged that a disliked monarch was not who he claimed to be, that his alleged parents, despairing of having real children, pretended to have a child that was really unrelated. Thus the births of royal children were often very public with many high ranking witnesses, and yet despite that a monarch's enemies would continue to claim that he was a false child. Examples: Emperor Frederick II and King James VIII and III aka The Old Pretender. 

$URL$ I believe Chilperic introduced three new letters to the alphabet that were abolished after his death. Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250) wrote De arte venandi cum avibus about hunting with falcons. $URL$ Conradin (1252-1268) was said to be "beautiful as Absalom, and spoke good Latin". $URL$ I believe that William of Norwich (1132-1144) was said to have been taught to read and write (English or Latin?) by his parents. So the author of his biography considered it plausible for ordinary townspeople to have some education - though perhaps not knowledge of Latin. Any way these example show that Latin speaking and/or literacy as not limited to priests but at least some secular leaders knew Latin. Added 05-15-2017. According to Dominic Mancini King Edward V (1470-1483?) as literate in at least one language. 

Internal customs in the Roman Empire1 So if internal customs duties were sometimes charged, and tolls for using the roads, travelers could ask or be told what province or dioceses or prefecture they were in, and which side of the empire it belonged to. Government offices and public buildings - possibly including toll collection posts - usually had portraits of the emperor or emperors. And possibly the eastern emperor was always more prominent in the eastern empire and vice versa. From the maps I have seen, the border between the eastern and western empires in Africa was in modern Libya, between Sirte and Benghazi, and probably near Bin Jawad, As Sidr, or Ras Lanuf. The province of Tripolitania would have been in the western empire, and Cyrenica - the province of Lybia Superior - in the eastern empire. I don't know how visible the border between east and west was in Africa. In Europe the border between the eastern and western parts of the empire was much longer. In the south, the province of Dalmatia was in the western part, and the province of Praevalitana was in the eastern part. To the north, Dalmatia was in the western part of the empire and Moesia I was in the eastern part. Part of the Province of Pannonia II in the west was north of part of Moesia I. The Sava River was the border between Pannonia II in the north and Moesia I in the South. The Drina River that zig zags north to join the Sava River was partially the border between Dalmatia and Moesia I. Today it is part of the border between Bosnia and Herzegovna and Serbia. The border was roughly north and south from somewhere on the Drina River to the Adriadic Sea somewhere near Budva. Most of modern Montenegro was east of the border. $URL$ $URL$ So much of the border in Europe was made by rivers. Crossing those sections of the Save and Drina rivers meant crossing from one half of the empire to the other. And travelers probably had to pay tolls and sometimes tariffs on their merchandise when crossing the border. And as far as I know that would have been all the formalities involved. 

The two answers from rancho and EvanM say the Julian calendar was not completed or perfected until during the reign of Augustus the first emperor. Actually the calendar was in its final, complete, and perfect form when introduced by Julius Caesar in 44 BC but the College of Pontiffs who administered it made what we might consider to be a very basic and obvious mistake. The Julian calendar has a leap year every fourth year, counted exclusively. If a year is a leap year it is not counted. The next year is year 1, the third year is year 2, the fourth year is year 3, and the fifth year is year 4 and the next leap year. Thus 2012 and 2016 were leap years and 2016 minus 2012 equals four. But the Pontiffs counted the years inclusively. A leap year would be year 1, the next year year 2, the third year year 3, and the fourth year year 4 and the next leap year. Thus, for example, year 730 AUC and year 733 AUC might both be leap years and 733 minus 730 would equal three, not four. During the reign of Augustus somebody noticed that the Pontiffs were making leap years too often. Augustus had the practice of adding a leap day halted for several years until the calendar days aligned properly and then had the leap years happen at the right intervals. Historians are not sure about the exact sequence of leap years and non leap years until the error was corrected. But it is usually believed that leap years since AD 4 or AD 8 were correct. Thus any date in the Julian Calendar after AD 8 at the latest should be correct to the day according to the Julian Calendar. $URL$ 

$URL$ This could be another version of the same story. In any case, medieval writers could imagine three way conflicts happening during this era. 

In the painting as a whole I see a lot of Dutch flags. In the enlarged part of the painting there is what looks like a Dutch flag with letters on it (East or west India Company?). I also see what looks like a yellow flag with something red on it, and possibly horizontal stripes. A building in the background has what looks like the Amsterdam coat of arms. I suppose it is a Dutch port and there are Dutch and foreign ships in it. I think that looking up the 17th century flags of Dutch and foreign provinces and seaports would be useful. I note that the flag of Flanders in France & Belgium was yellow with a black lion on it but those look like eagles and not lions. Most of the north German ports had red and white flags. The Holy Roman Emperor and the Tsar of Russia had yellow flags with black 2 headed eagles. And some of their subjects might have flown such flags. Just as a stone slab with a carved 2 headed eagle was excavated from the site of the Hanseatic offices in London. The king of the Romans and future emperor used a yellow coat of arms with a single headed eagle but that ship in the painting is unlikely to have used his banner. A coat of arms yellow with a single headed eagle was sometimes also used for the kingdom of Germany and so some German ships MIGHT possibly might have flown a flag with that coat of arms. You should look in 17th century flag charts for similar flags. In my experience flags with eagles were rare. $URL$ There was no law against a shipowner having a personal coat of arms and banner of yellow with a black eagle, so it could have been a private flag. What type of ship flew the eagle flags and how far was it likely to travel? It looks like a small ship to me. Putting banner like flags on staffs at the end of diagonal booms is an unfamiliar practice to me. Are there specific occasions or types of ships that would be done on? Here is a site for flag identification questions: $URL$ Added 04-02-2018 - I note that the eagle flag looks square, like a banner, while most of the other flags seem rectangular, like flags normally flown by ships, which may be a clue. 

$URL$ John Brown's followers should have been able to imagine that they constituted an invasion of Virginia, and that by planning a slave rebellion they were planning large scale domestic violence. Thus they should have been able to imagine that the federal government would be obligated to try to stop them and thus that their plans would likely result in "levying War against them" (the United states) and thus committing treason. And of course the plan involved seizing the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry that could be considered "levying War against them" (the United states) and thus committing treason. Just as members of a dependent Indian tribe would be guilty of treason by attacking a federal fort or Indian agency or as southerners were guilty of treason when seizing federal arsenals, forts, and other installations. And in fact President Buchanan ordered 90 marines from the US Navy Yard in Washington DC to Harper's Ferry where they defeated John Brown's raiders under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee of the Second United states Cavalry. So John Brown and his followers were guilty of treason against the United States. But John Brown and his followers were tried and convicted for Treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection. $URL$ And that kind of gets my goat. I can't help thinking that President Buchanan should have had Brown extradited to the District of Columbia to be charged with Treason against the United States. IMHO the US constitution should be amended to say that no government dependent on the United states, such as a state, or Indian tribe, or county, or municipality, etc. etc. that ever committed in the past or commits in the future treason against the United States, shall ever again be able to have a statute defining a crime of treason against itself. And furthermore, if any official of any dependent government prosecutes, convicts, or punishes someone for treason against that dependent government while that dependent government is committing treason against the United States, that official shall be guilty of violating the civil rights of the persons so charged, and shall suffer penalties proscribed by federal law for violatign civil rights, or else penalties equal to the total of all the penalties inflicted upon every person he prosecutes, convicts, or punishes for treason against that traitorous dependent government, whichever is harsher. 

Here is a link to the Royal Ark site, specifically the detailed and hopefully accurate genealogy of the Mughal dynasty, including some descendants to the present day. $URL$ It is an interesting fact that some members of the Mughal Dynasty were allegedly descended from European royalty. King of Kings Ismail I (1487-1524), founder of the Safavid Dynasty of Persia, was the maternal grandson of Despina Khatun or Theodore Megale Komnene, daughter of Emperor John IV of Trebizond. And there were marriages between the Safavids and members of the Mughal Dynasty. 

In some places the borders were very vague zones like a line of hills or mountains or a forest, or a swamp, and in some places they were sharp like rivers and streams, and stone walls between fields. There are many dykes in Europe besides the Dutch dykes that keep the ocean out. These other dykes usually consist of a deep ditch in front and a high earth rampart behind made with the dirt from the ditch. They were used to mark borders of various kinds in Europe for thousands of years up to the middle ages. An early medieval Bulgarian khan conquered land from the eastern Roman Empire and marked his new border with the "Great Fence", a long dyke. The total length of all the dykes in Europe, and the total amount of labor to move that much dirt, is immense. And some of those dykes were made in the middle ages, as I have said. Another form of border between properties in more or less medieval Europe was hedgerows, which were sort of like modern suburban hedges but more complicated and harder to cross. In India, the British government built the Inland Customs Line to collect customs fees on merchandise and to prevent smuggling of salt from regions with low salt tax to regions with high salt tax. By the 1870s the line grew to 4,000 kilometers or 2,500 miles long. In many places the line was fortified with a hedge made of dry dead sticks and thorns that was replaced as fast as possible with a planted hedge of live thorns, "The Great Hedge of India". By 1878 there were 1,109.5 miles of inferior live hedge, dry hedge, and stone wall, and 411.5 miles of perfect live hedge. In 1879 the salt tax was collected at the points of production and the Great Hedge was abandoned. The abandoned Great Hedge was soon almost forgotten and destroyed by neglect. Roy Moxham, author of The Great Hedge of India (2001) made three trips to India before finally finding a possible remnant of the Great Hedge. $URL$ The historian Procopius mentioned a Frankish embassy to Constantinople and tall tales Anglo-Saxons in the embassy told about Britain. In particular, one story about a wall that ran from north to south across Britain and nothing could live on the west side of it. If a man crossed to the west side he would drop dead. this is commonly believed to be a distorted version of Hadrian's Wall. But my theory is that it was a barrier separating British territory on the west from Anglo-Saxon territory on the east. Any Anglo-Saxons caught west of the wall without permission would be immediately executed. And perhaps Anglo-Saxon mothers told their children fairy tales about anyone who crossed the barrier instantly dying. Why haven't archaeologists found remains of this hypothetical death barrier? Probably it connected several different shorter sections into one whole line. Some parts of it would use preexisting dykes, some of which still exist and are known, and other parts might have been wooden palisades. Other sections might have been long hedgerows like the Great Fence of India. Since this barrier line was obsolete before 600 AD, the wooden palisades all were burned as firewood or rotted away in over 1,400 years and the hedgerows would have disappeared like the Great Fence of India disappeared in a tenth of the time. And it is possible that there might in some places and times have been stones standing along roads marked with the names and/or coats of arms of fiefs and kingdoms at their borders. Possibly there might even have been buildings in some places and times with some sort of border officials.
