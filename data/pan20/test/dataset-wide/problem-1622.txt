So he was born to Somali refugees in Kenya and grew up in the United States. Perhaps that might not technically refute the claim, but it is quite close. And of course, the 2016 Ohio State University attack was committed by another Somali refugee. From CNN: 

So, these are results of a calculation, not falsified. They may be slightly inaccurate in that it seems that they are using a source other than the 2013 census data. Note that I'm doing this math not to make any claims, but simply to explain how the calculations worked. The claim 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2015 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released December, 2016. Data are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 1999-2015, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at $URL$ on Oct 7, 2017 7:41:37 PM This shows smoother, less variable results than the previous attempts. From 1999 to 2010, the numbers go down rather steadily from 249.6 to 212.3. From 2010 to 2015, the numbers stabilize to 212.0 in 2015. If they had gone down at the same rate as from 1999-2015, that would have been about 195 in 2015. Is the Age Adjusted Rate the correct one to use? If we look at how it is calculated, we find that it works by aggregating the data by ten-year age brackets and then generating a weighted sum as if the age brackets were as common as they were in 2000. This may be the best that CDC's WONDER makes available, but it's not what we'd use if we were calculating these numbers ourselves. I would prefer to bucket by year rather than decade. And I would like to use age distributions from the 2010-2015 period, as those are the ones about which we are talking. The 2000 number may give an incorrect estimate of the impact in years like 2013 and 2015. I also find it worrisome that if we look at just the 25-34 bracket, we see increasing mortality in the 2010-2015 period. At that age, there shouldn't be a significant impact from age. If anything, the younger members are more prone to risky behaviors. External causes 

PolitiFact ruled that mostly true. They found that Will cherry picked that number, but there was in fact a survey showing an approval of 95% (in 2008). And the other surveys they found were consistently at least 81% in 2009. So we can see that satisfaction dropped for employer plans dropped from at least 81% in 2009 to 66% in 2016 (Gallup). It is absolutely true that we don't know what would have happened in 2010-2015 without PPACA. But we do know what did not happen with PPACA. And what did not happen is a decrease in mortality rates, even though rates fell consistently from 1999-2010. So at best we can say that PPACA was ineffective at overcoming any confounding effect. At worst, it may have been actively harmful. I agree that we can't make either statement at this time. Which takes me back to the 36,000 claim being hooey. If we can't even explain the actual behavior of mortality rates since 2010, then there is no way that we can project out behavior if PPACA were repealed. There is at this time, literally zero evidence that PPACA has prevented mortality on an average basis. And any claim that repeal would increase mortality is without a scientific foundation. Perhaps the evidence is being collected and will be published. But it doesn't exist at this moment in time. What little evidence we have goes the other direction. 

Follow the citations TL;DR: Politifact ruled the claim False. Politifact found that Deborah Friedell was quoting Michael Antonio (who wrote Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success) who was misquoting the National Journal. He sort of pushed the two quotes together, taking the parts that sounded best from both. Or look at the source The claim in the National Journal said: 

That said, there are some weaknesses in the MPV analysis if someone wants to claim it proves racism. While looking through the data, I found one case where a former police officer is accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend. While she was black and unarmed, it seems something of a stretch to call this a police killing. He certainly wasn't on-duty or acting in any kind of official capacity at the time. A double murder and suicide, a backyard brawl, and other off-duty examples also pollute the data. In one case, the decedent had been drowning a police officer when killed. While technically unarmed, his use of water as a weapon would likely have resulted in the officer's death if he had not been stopped. The data doesn't say whether the killer was white or black. We usually discuss these statistics when there is a case involving a white police office and a black decedent. The statistics don't tell us how common or rare that is. The MPV source includes: 

It's worth noting that this may not have required much predictive ability. He seems to have felt that they came close to splitting the country in 1820 and that the Missouri Compromise was only delaying the problem. 

So at one point last year, there were exactly 377 office staff in the White House. At that time, the total payroll was $35,766,744 or a bit under $100,000 per person. It is not clear to me if this number is the equivalent of the Pal√°cio do Planalto number. This is reporting advisors to the president. This may or may not be the same thing as the other number. Also realize that the number fluctuates and may increase to as many as 500 paid $40 million without breaking precedent. NPR is an independent entity, but it does receive some government funding. 

Parkland was the tenth school mass shooting in that list. If you use a slightly different definition with their data, you can drop that down to six "school shootings" starting with Columbine. The revised definition is an event where four or more students are shot and killed at an elementary or high school, not including the perpetrator (who may or may not count as a student). This is because five of the Axios "school shootings" were universities or colleges. There were only sixty children (18 and younger; not including perpetrators) killed in those six shootings. Eleven of the victims were adults, and six of the seven perpetrators committed suicide. The other sixty fatalities were in the college shootings, including one where three instructors were killed. Using either the Axios definition or the modification, Parkland is the only school mass shooting in 2018. The next most recent is either 2015 or 2014, depending on if universities are included. 

Background This bears some confusion. Gerrymandering is a real thing, but it is not the primary problem with (from the other answer) 

That impression is incorrect. If we go back to the raw data, 2509 white victims were killed by whites and 409 by blacks. So a white murder victim was about six times more likely to be killed by another white person than a black person. The diagram adjusts for population. One of the problems with these kinds of comparisons is that there are about six times as many whites as blacks. So looking at the raw data will produce higher numbers for whites than blacks on almost any measure. So it is common to normalize the data so as to make the statistics more comparable. Describing the resulting statistic is complicated, particularly in this case. Perhaps we might say that a black murderer with a white victim is about as common among blacks as a white murderer with a white victim is among whites. I.e. about ten (rounded up from 9.94) in a million whites murder a white person and about 9 (rounded down from 9.09) in a million blacks murder a white person. Be careful though, as people can easily misinterpret statistics like that. And of course this entirely ignores the possibility that a single person murdered multiple victims. 

This is also described as the Mexico City Policy. Also see CNN. Official press release. Note that this describes it as a presidential memorandum rather than an executive order. I'll leave it up to the reader whether to regard the original claim as substantially true (Trump restored the Mexico City Policy) or technically false (not an executive order). Or both. I also do not try to determine the impact of the action. I assert that this establishes the following claim: Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum that restores the Mexico City Policy. 

Basically, this has been true for a long time. It is actually less true now than it was in less partisan times, e.g. 1960-1992. One difference is that during that period, it was the Democrats who were outperforming their vote share. 

No As per the statistics that @gerrit cited, the statement as listed is untrue. There are almost as many firefighters alone as tax preparers. There is a true way of stating it. If we explicitly limit to just full time paid fire fighters and law enforcement professionals, then there are more tax preparers. However, this is a fundamentally unfair way of counting. If we are going to limit fire fighters to just the full time paid members, we should also limit the tax preparers in the same way. Many tax preparers are themselves part time. They work just for the few months after W-2 and 1099 forms are issued and before 1040 forms are due. If we limited just to professional, full-time tax preparers, there are only about 70,000 as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To get the larger number, we have to include seasonal tax-preparers and accountants/auditors who fill out tax returns. So there are fewer career tax preparers than there are career fire fighters or law enforcement professionals separately, much less added together. Regardless, the Economist's formulation is incorrect. As written, the statement would include volunteer firefighters and paid-per-call firefighters. But including them means that there are about as many firefighters alone as tax preparers, even including seasonal workers and people whose profession is listed as accountant or auditor. 

However, there are at least two factual inaccuracies elsewhere in their story, so take that with a grain of salt. If believed, this would confirm Spicer's assertion that there was more fencing in 2017 than 2013. However, the same story contradicts the assertion that there were more magnetometers. Unfortunately, it does so in a factually inaccurate way: 

The way that the Tesla system is supposed to work is that the driver is supposed to be monitoring the situation and take control when necessary. The system can notify the driver that it is confused and ask the driver to take control. Prior to this update, it was apparently possible to refuse to take control. Maybe the system is even safer now. Or maybe not. You can also read the NHTSA report (PDF) of the investigation into this accident for more information. Not enough information doesn't mean that it is untrue. It means that we should try to get more information if we want to be able to answer that question. The little bit of information that we currently have is consistent with that claim. 

Note that the statements in the article mix findings from examining state level data with results from polls. Presumably Brooks' book gives more detailed citations. One reason why I included these is that they directly dispute the assertion that conservatives give more as a percentage of income because they are poorer. As the first factoid shows, conservative households give more in raw dollar terms even though they have lower incomes. As the second factoid shows, conservatives give more in non-monetary resources. Note that this doesn't dispute that these things are more true because of religion than political partisanship. But "religiosity" itself is predictable from political partisanship. Another source. Again, they find that religious people give more and conservatives/Republicans are more religious than liberals/Democrats. TLDR: The statistic is real but the interpretation can be contested. Religious people give more. Conservatives/Republicans are more religious. Conservatives/Republicans give more (because they are more religious). All statistically true by every source that checked. Subject to different interpretations. 

However, it's worth noting that the bill is continually changing. So even though that analysis may have been true when it was made, it might not be now. Politico reports: 

We see some confusion about proportionality in particular. Note that this does not mean that if a given election goes 52-48 for one party that the party with 52 should win a majority of the seats. It means that the seats should be divided in such a way that the voters are split in reasonable proportion. There are multiple reasons why vote share is not a good proxy in United States elections: 

So the kernel of truth to the claim is that 20% of the uranium production capacity of the US is now controlled by a Russian agency. The problems are that this is production, not uranium. Also, Russia doesn't "have" it. They can't export uranium from the US, so the uranium being produced in the US is still being sold in the US. Note: while the US uranium is probably safe, Russia has more control over the Kazakhstan uranium. But that's not what Trump said. While there is a real event here, he did not describe it correctly, today or previously. 

This is a real statistic, but it is important to understand what it says. For every million white people and every million black people, a certain number of unarmed people of that race are killed by police. That number for black people is about five times as high as the equivalent number for white people. All that said, even just looking at unarmed people, their data shows more whites (259) than blacks (244) were killed. That source did their own research, but it is consistent with other sources. For example, the Washington Post found: 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2015 on CDC WONDER Online Database, released December, 2016. Data are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 1999-2015, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Accessed at $URL$ on Oct 7, 2017 9:29:18 PM We're back to the original conclusion. Even adjusting for age, mortality rates first stabilized and then increased after PPACA. Prior, mortality rates had been falling. Summary Prior to PPACA, children were covered under their parents' coverage, Medicaid, or by programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). We can expect that PPACA would have less effect on them. Prior to PPACA, seniors aged 65 and up were and are covered by Medicare. The only effect that PPACA should have on them would come from the cuts that were used to fund PPACA. The age adjusted rates require use of the age brackets. So we could either start at age 15 or at 25. We started at 15. This includes those who stayed on their parents insurance from 18 to 25. We could and did end at 64, exactly where the non-Medicare group ends. When looking at those 15-64, mortality rates have increased or at least stayed the same since PPACA passed. This is true regardless of whether we included external causes or used the age adjusted rates. While mortality rates fell from 1999-2010, rates either held steady after 2010 or increased. As such, we can't make any claims about what would happen if PPACA were repealed in its entirety. We might hope that mortality rates might fall again, but we don't know that. 36,000 It can be argued that this analysis ignores confounding factors and doesn't establish causality. That's true. However, the 36,000 claim ignores almost all data. The only data it tries to incorporate is increased coverage data. It then assumes that increased coverage will have a certain benefit in terms of mortality. Where does it get that benefit? It uses a value that someone made up for use in a previous model. That's not science. It's barely math. All that ignores the possibility that the increased coverage is coming at the expense of quality of coverage. And there is some evidence of that. For example, Time magazine reported that health insurance satisfaction reached a ten year low in 2015. Gallup reports that continued in 2016. Time reported a satisfaction rate of 69% in 2015 and Gallup reported 66% in 2015 and 64% in 2016. Columnist George Will said:
