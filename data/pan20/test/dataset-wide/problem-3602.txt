You say that you're doing calisthenics and you want to target the lower pecs. You have effectively just described the need for dips! My personal favourite exercise. I'm sure you already know how to do them and what they are. But a few pointers: 

There aren't many machine exercises, if any, other than the leg press, that can actually cause this. So I don't think it can really be compared. My point is, you could certainly do leg press and not get injured, assuming you don't let your ego take over and load up too much weight, and additionally assuming you reinforce proper posture, disc position, rep speed, etc. But obviously the chance of getting injured is higher, as compared to, well basically any other machine (except for that rotating side-side oblique twist, that's awful). 

So you either have weak grip or your hands are actually physically slipping. Both very fixable issues, so don't be discouraged! If it is ACTUAL slipping, then there's a few things you can do. First, flour doesn't work NEARLY as well as just pure chalk. You know the stuff that olympic lifters use? You can get some at any supplement store or sports store for at most $5. Just thoroughly rub it on both your palms and you should be good to go. Flour really doesn't compare to chalk in my opinion, so FIRST thing you should do is go invest in some. Next option, change your grip. Try using a hook grip, where your wrap your thumb around the bar then wrap your thumb with your hand (should google a picture or something). This will hurt your thumb at first but over time you'll get used to it and you won't slip this way. You could even try a false grip, hanging off of your palms like a monkey. Next option (and most effective) use lifting straps. There is absolutely NO WAY that you could slip using these. Just wrap the straps around the bar and tighten the straps and you could basically hang off of the bar forever until your lats give out. You could also get these at any supplement/sports stores or the internet. The one downside to these is that you won't get to work on your grip strength at all, but if your main focus is core, then you can and should do this. You can work on your grip in other exercises. As an additional note, gloves won't actually do anything for your grip at all. All gloves do is basically help with your hands not hurting and prevent calluses. I definitely don't recommend gloves so your hands can toughen up on their own. Now, the above 3 are basically guaranteed to prevent further slipping provided you do them right, so try them. Now, the only other explanation is that you have a weak grip...like half the gym population. Now, if you don't care about this, then use lifting straps. But if you do actually care, then you need to work on it. There are lots of grip workouts that you can do that you will online. But the simplest way to get better at this is to just practice it. Your forearms are used everyday so they need a different kind of stimulus. Also, bodyweight exercises are more motor function oriented rather than just basic muscle strength. This means if you want to be able to hang off of the bar without trouble, then you need to just practice hanging off the bar. Start with 3-4 sets of hangs on the bar as long as you can, and strive to improve the duration/sets with each workout or week. You can add on reverse/hammer curls to work on your brachialis, as well as wrist curls to directly work grip. You should also try to incorporate some towel pull ups in order to really improve grip strength. This is where you would hang a towel (or any cloth really) off of a bar and either hang off it or do pullups. To fix this, you just need to be able to diagnose yourself. So basically, if it's actual slipping, then use real chalk, lifting straps, or a hook grip. If it's just pure grip weakness, just practice. Add direct hanging and pulling work and work on the primary muscles involved such as the lats, biceps , and forearms. Research some grip workouts, everyone is different and it's up to you to find one that you enjoy and works for you. If you don't care at all about grip strength, you can just use lifting straps. If it's a mix of both weak grip and slippery bar, use either chalk or a hook grip. 

Well, BMI is based on weight and height. and since you can't really increase height, you need to gain weight as you say. You also say in a "healthy" way, I'm going to assume this means max muscle gain with minimal to no fat increase. Depending on your fitness history, this will determine how "quick" the weight gain is. For example, if you haven't weight trained at all previously, then your body has no idea what weight training stimulus is and as a result, it will have to immediately adapt as a survival mechanism to this external stress. Basically, you'll gain weight faster regardless at this stage. If you have some weight training history, it'll be a little bit slower but since you're asking this question, it's safe to assume you're still at the beginning stages. Technically speaking, you can only add on weight if you consume more calories than your spend, i.e you eat more than what you burn off during exercise or due to your resting metabolic rate. Since you said "healthy" weight gain, it's a little bit more complicated since you want minimal fat gain. Well, a guideline is you would consume around 14-15x your bodyweight in lbs to maintain the weight you are at, so, depending on how quick you want results and how much fat gain you want to limit, you're going to want to consume around 15-20x your bodyweight in lbs. Of these calories, you need at the very minimum 1g of protein per lbs of bodyweight. We need protein because when you breakdown your muscles during weight training, proteins are the main way your body builds them back up, and back up stronger and bigger (given you ate enough). The rest of your calories will come from carbs and fat obviously...how much will depend on your carb tolerance. Generally, you don't want to eat too many sugary foods as they will make you become insulin resistant, and insulin is one of the most anabolic, if not the most, hormones in the body (anabolic means building the muscles back up, whereas catabolic is the opposite, together these two constitute your metabolism). Anyways, there are lots of great weight gain diet articles out there but this should point you in the right direction, it's always better to do your own research and your own experiments on your own body, since noone will know your body and your habits better than you. Everyone is unique, and genetics do play a role, so just keep that in mind. If you are VERY new, then you could argue that you don't even need to keep these tips in mind, and that you should just eat..eat alot, eat often, then eat more...just keep eating until you can't...then do it again. I'll quickly mention that sleep is CRUCIAL since rest is when your body builds itself back up, therefore if you don't get enough sleep (AT LEAST 6 hours at the very very minimum), you will halt your weight gain. In terms of exercise, PLEASE don't be one of the people that weigh 100lbs of all bone and go to the gym only to work arms...this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen and yet it happens every day. Just think, if you want to become larger, WHY would you train the smallest muscles in your body? I'm not saying don't train them at all, but definitely not anything more than twice a week for now, as you get more advanced you can play around and see what works. Now, the easiest way then, to add mass, is to work your larger muscles...makes sense right? This means start doing compound movements, i.e your squats, your deadlifts, bench, rows, pullups, overhead press, dips...etc. Not only are these movements going to recruit more overall muscle fibres, they also release more hormones due to their recruitment patterns, this is CRUCIAL for lifters who do not supplement with hormones (steroids and hgh). You don't need to over complicate things, just go to the gym 3,4, or 5 times a week (make sure to get at least 2 rest days since your muscles wont grow unless they recover), lift some weights...have a training plan, train certain groups of muscles on certain days or do full body or split into lower and upper. You don't need to do the "bro" split, which is when the entire universe does chest & triceps, back & biceps, legs, shoulders & arms if you don't want. Just go to the gym and train hard. For optimal growth, grab a weight that you can barely get 12 reps with and do that for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, and NEVER forget to progress in the gym... This means if you benched 135lbs for 4 sets of 8 reps last week, try 140-145 for 4 sets of 8 now, try to improve, try to overload the muscles, this is the only way they will grow. Once again there are lots of training articles, way more than I can cover here, so just go look them up, experiment yourself, do your research, and most of all just stay dedicated...at the end of the day, the people that you see that are more muscular, stronger, leaner, bigger, just wanted it more, and they did the work to get there. What you should take from this: 

You are correct, the human body wasn't made to sit down for long periods of time. It is very unnatural, but with the information age, it is basically inevitable. I work as a software developer and understand your pain. There are a few things you can do. You can get a stand up desk, so that you limit straining your lower back and engraving an unnatural position for your spine. If this is not an option, try to get up and stretch every 20 minutes or so, go for a little walk, get a cup of tea, if your building has stairs, go up and down these stairs. I don't really know your situation so I can't recommend any specific exercises but if none of these are an option, try to offset the time you spend sitting down by the time you spend standing up and moving. So if you work all day and sit down all day from 9-5, then when you get home, go to the gym, go for a long walk, go for a jog, go biking, play a sport, go gardening, anything that's movement will be beneficial. Just stay active :) 

Since you seem like a COMPLETE beginner, I'm going to make this really easy for you. The ONLY way to increase your bodyweight is to eat more calories than you burn. Simple right? Now before you think "well I don't exercise anyways so I don't burn any calories", you have to understand that your body burns calories on its own everyday just to make your body function properly. This is what is referred to as your resting metabolic rate (or metabolism ...doesn't really matter to narrow down at this point). You weigh 47kgs, so that means your metabolic rate is probably around 1500 calories roughly. So if you ate less than this on a regular basis, you won't gain weight. Basically...just eat a lot more than 1500 calories and you will gain weight, you don't really need to count, just ballpark. Second, you say "proper" body shape, I assume this means you want muscle. Well...muscle isn't weightless obviously, so in order to gain muscle, you must first eat more than you burn like I said above. The rest is very simple. Go to the gym and workout. There are millions of workout guides online for beginners, it would be naive to give you only one way on this site. Go look it up and pick one. The way this works is when you lift weights, you're breaking down muscle fibers (catabolism). Now, when you eat an excess of calories (primarily composed of protein), these muscles are built back, bigger and stronger via the calories you just fed them (anabolism). One key to this process is that in order for this to work, you must feed your body the correct building blocks, called amino acids and you get these from your proteins; milk,chicken,beef,eggs,tuna,whey and on. Moreover, your body must have adequate time to do this building process. This means you need to sleep and sleep often. This is typically around 7-8 hours minimum to be safe. The muscle growth happens when your recovering, and you recover when you're sleeping. So to very naively conclude: Eat more than you burn. And then eat some more. This is fundamental to gaining weight. When you do eat more, make sure the majority of your calories come from protein. A basic guideline is to consume a gram of protein per lbs of bodyweight, so in your case, aim for at least 105g. Go to the gym and lift weights. Sleep, rest, repeat. It really is THAT simple, I'm not going to write an article on all the things you need to do because what I mentioned above is basically 99% of it. The rest just comes to consistency and dedication. Again: EAT, LIFT, EAT MORE, AND SLEEP. 

First, I want to make sure you're not making the same mistakes that most people make when it comes to calves. Doing calf specific work won't necessarily make your calves bigger, unless your chemically enhanced via steroids. When you're a natural lifter, most of your muscle growth (except for when you first start lifting weights for a few months) will happen on a systematic basis. What this means in a nutshell, is something I'm sure you've heard before...big compound movements. Big compound movements, release more hormones, invoke more protein synthesis, and improve neural efficiency as they recruit more muscles, and energy. In terms of calves, think about this for a second, when's the last time that you saw someone who could deadlift or squat over 500lbs and had small calves? Probably very rarely...if at all. Now think about how many people you've seen at the gym with a massive upper body with basically twig calves? I know, I've seen a lot. This is due to not doing lower body compound movements, or just not doing them enough... for example squatting once a week may not even be enough...think about it! Let's say you do bench one day, shoulders another, and arms another...you are engaging your triceps THREE times a week as opposed to training your legs only once, I'm not saying you do this, I'm just trying to show you a picture. Now, when I had small calves, the way I overcame it was by focusing on working my legs more frequently in general, i.e twice a week, and of course adding some calf work at the end of these workouts. Because remember, you can't have big calves without somewhat of a big squat or deadlift...unless you have some great genetics, or are old (old ppl have massive calves usually) So, to work calves, I would suggest, first do a lot of squats and deadlifts, as your lifts go up in these two movements you'll be surprised how much your calves grow. Remember, when you're natural you're more likely to grow systematically, so you need big movements like these. Particularly, a GREAT exercise for calves that most people don't seem to know about is the stiff legged deadlift, or romanian deadlift. I'm not gonna go over the form here as I'm sure you can look up the details online. But it is VERY good for your calves and a compound movement so even better. If you don't believe me, stand up straight with your legs straight, knees slightly bent, and try to touch your toes...feel the stretch in your hamstrings and calves? Once you get the big movements out of the way like squats and deadlifts, THEN you should be focusing on some direct calf work if they're your weakness. I will tell you about a very nice trick for working calves at any gym. First, the machine that you have is actually great, and over time as you keep doing it, your shoulders will adapt and so you shouldn't really stop...maybe just go a bit lighter and do higher reps until u can move up. Now, your calves do not need a lot of weight in order to be stimulated...they are one of the few muscle groups that respond well to high rep work, such as forearms and traps. (This is because you use your forearms and calves EVERYDAY in any activity so they need slightly different stimulus in order to invoke growth). Furthermore, something most people don't know is, that your calves mostly function as stabilizers! Now given these two assumptions (they're more or less facts by now, but I'm sure some people won't agree so...), you can do A LOT of different movements to invoke calf growth. My favourite would be to lay down two 5 or 10 or 25 lbs plates on the ground. Grab two dumbbells , one in each hand, (weight about 20-60lbs ...really depends on you). To begin, place the balls of your shoes, on the weights on the ground so that your heel is still on the ground but your upper feet are on an angle (similar to how you would start on a calf raise machine), then with the two dumbbells by your side, slowly do a calf raise, going ALL the way up , pausing at the top for 1-2 seconds, squeezing the muscle, and going ALL the way down and feeling the stretch . Do this for about 2-5 sets of 10-25 reps...increase the weight as you progress. You can also do this on a smith machine with barbell on your upper traps, but I would really suggest away from this, since like I said, your calves are stabilizers, so stay away from machines until the very end where you can overload the muscles with more weight. I.e, you can just get in a normal squat position with the bar on your back with more or less the same weight you squat with, but just do the weight elevated calf raises instead. At the end, go find a leg press machine, horizontal or vertical doesn't matter...push the weight up with your legs so that your legs are almost straight, but NOT fully locked as this will destroy your knees, keep the weight on the balls of your feet, i.e from half way up your shoes, keeping your heels not touching the platform at all, and do calf presses there for a few sets of 10-20 reps. Search up leg press calf raises for more information if you want. But after squats or/and deadlifts, you shouldn't need more than 1-2 movements for your calves. Moreover, other than your basic calf raising movements, another great way to stimulate your calves would be to do explosive plyometric jumps. Find a hip-level box, step on it, then "walk" (NOT JUMP) off of it so you impactfully land on the balls of your feet and IMMEDIATELY jump up as high as you can, focusing on pushing and following through with your calves...again you should look this exercise up online as well for more help. As a final note, if you REALLY have tried everything and your calves just won't grow, it would be a good idea to switch things up and work out your calves FIRST in the workout. Exercise priority (order of exercises performed in a workout) actually matters quite a lot in the long run and will benefit lagging muscles. So go to the gym, start with 1-2 of the calf movements I mentioned above (there's tons online as well, way more than any of us could list), after these your calves will be tired, so that when you perform big movements like a squat or a deadlift, your calves will be exhausted and thus will have to work twice as hard in order to keep up...effectively making the exercise more biased towards training calves. Hope that helps.
