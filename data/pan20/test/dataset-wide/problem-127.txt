The best starting point would be knowing about Turing Machines. Alan Turing thought these up in 1936, so your human-vampire hybrid could have learned about these shortly before entering hybernation. In case you are not aware, a Turing machine is basically an abstract version of a computer. It's a theoretical device that can compute anything that can be computed. Computers are really just fast Turing machines with fancy outputs. If your hybrid had heard about Turing machines, waking up from hibernation and seeing computers would, instead of being a "what in the world is that" experience, be a "wow, they actually made them" experience. 

As far as how we would interpret colors and such if we could see polarized light, you need to understand that polarization is different than other colors. For human color vision, we have cone cells that are particularly stimulated by certain wavelengths of light. For instance, blue-detecting cones are most stimulated by light with a wavelength of around 430 nm. Polarization is basically which direction the light wave is vibrating. This is independent of wavelength - you can have blue light polarized the same as red light, while another source of blue light could be polarized differently than those two. Given that wavelength and polarization are independent, I think we would interpret it separately. For comparison, think about light blue, light red, dark blue, and dark red. The darkness or lightness of the color is easily separated from the color itself. Polarization would be like that - another aspect of color that we would be able to describe and that can easily be compared across colors. What magic tricks, etc. would no longer work on us? This wouldn't prevent any magic tricks from working on us. When was the last time you saw a magician do a trick that was actually obvious because some part of the trick accidentally used two different colors when it should have used one? Being able to perceive polarized light, the magician would make sure that the materials used didn't polarize light in such a way as to give the trick away. It's entirely possible that magicians would have to be more particular about lighting and materials used, but that's not a significant change from what they do now. What would no longer be hidden from us? Some animals use polarized light as part of their mating routines, so we would be able to see them wooing each other. What would be obfuscated? Nothing natural. You'd have to design something that rapidly changed the polarization of light it reflects/emits to produce a strobe-like effect. As I said earlier, polarization would be categorized differently than color, so it would not make it harder for us to perceive anything that we can currently perceive. How would we perceive the sky and the stars? As I quoted earlier, the atmosphere polarizes light from the sun, so we'd be able to see patterns in the sky that could help us navigate. Stars produce unpolarized light, so they'd look the same other than how the sky polarizes light. 

This sounds like a recipe for coalitions and potential disaster. First of all, I don't know if it's possible to allow smaller parties to thrive while avoiding coalitions. If no single party has a majority, then they are going to need to work with other parties in order to get the things done that they want to. This naturally leads to forming a coalition with one or more other parties that whose ideologies are reasonably similar. I'm not sure why you're averse to coalitions, though. Using the US as an example (because that's where I live so it's the one I'm most familiar with), the two major parties are probably not that different from a coalition that might form elsewhere. They need to have a broad message that appeals to a large number of people, so their party platform ends up being just as diverse. So in some ways, the Republican and Democratic parties are really the Republican and Democratic coalitions. However, the biggest issue with this is the instability it will cause, and the inherent dissatisfaction that can lead to. For example, consider three seats and two parties, where each district votes fairly similarly: 

Realistically, no. You've probably seen videos of computers or robots that have some capacity to interpret what people say. What they don't tell you is how much raw data is required to build the data model that allows the computers and robots to do that. For interpreting text (that's already in a nice easy-for-a-computer-to-use format) you'd want to have a dataset of thousands of texts. These aren't "See Spot Run" texts, these should be on average short novels. You'd need a very large group of people dedicated to transcribing data to produce a dataset that could begin to be used to teach these robots how to understand you. Even with a dataset large enough, medieval technology would still fail at this - the math and physics known to them are not sufficient. The algorithms for interpreting text (let alone understanding spoken language) require quite a bit of math that would be well beyond the reach of a medieval wizard. To make it even worse, you don't just have to teach the computer how to understand the words that are spoken, you have to teach it how to hear. That requires a knowledge of how sound works and the types of sound waves that speech produces. Even with an army of wizards at your disposal, I don't think you'd be able to overcome these problems. Each step of advancing knowledge of physics, math, and algorithms takes a lot of time because of how many possible dead ends there are (with some dead ends not being apparent for quite a while). Given that we're not going to be able to do this without hand-waving, why not introduce handwavium crystals? These crystals resonate with magic, and under certain circumstances (perhaps magic used directly on them in a particular way) they can reproduce a series of magics used in their presence. Once placed inside the robots, they would work like an artificial brain - a wizard would use magic to direct the robot's body to do a certain task. Then the crystal is activated using the battery and will reproduce the same actions. A new robot would be very dumb - it could only exactly mimic the actions that the wizard just caused it to do. Over time, the crystal would learn more subtlety and be able to handle situations with more versatility. This makes older robots (or at least their crystals) much more valuable. 

TL;DR A god-like being has offered to give humanity a wish. Story John and Edna, working as night security guards at the British Museum, are sitting in a control room watching CCTV feeds when Edna notices something out of the corner of her eye. She only gets a quick glimpse, but it was almost certainly a person walking around. She quickly looks for and identifies Colin, another guard who is walking through the museum, but he is in a different section of the museum. 

Not going to happen Let's start by assuming the blob is, like most life on Earth, mostly water. We'll also say that it is about the same density as water - 1000 kg/m^3. Figuring out how hard it would be for the blob to escape the Earth's gravity well will be tricky because we have to take into account things like wind resistance due to the atmosphere. So first we'll ignore the Earth and look at how hard it would be to escape the Sun's gravity well and leave the solar system. From the Earth, the escape velocity for leaving the solar system is 42km/s. That's dang fast. For reference, the speed of sound in water is 1.48km/s. This is also a hard limit for how fast your blob could throw a chunk of itself - pressure energy can't realistically travel faster than that through water. So imagine that somehow your blob can throw a chunk of itself at 1.48km/s, then that chunk can throw a chunk of itself at 1.48km/s, and so on until something gets to 42km/s. Simple math tells us the chunks-throwing-chunks needs to happen 29 times. In order to propel 2/3 of itself forward at 1.48km/s, a chunk would have to propel the other 1/3 backwards at 2.96km/s. As I've already mentioned, that can't happen so the absolute best case scenario would be for the chunk to propel half of its mass forward at each stage. Unfortunately for your blob, you've got to worry about exponential decay. Cutting itself in half 29 times doesn't leave it much to work with - you'll have $\frac{1}{2^{29}}$ as much left as you started with. So if you took the entire biomass of the Earth (around $4\times 10^{15}$kg), you could get $7.45\times 10^6$kg to escape velocity. That's enough for a 19 meter cube. Now let's look at the energy densities involved. To keep things simple, consider a chunk as stationary and consider the kinetic energy of a chunk moving at 1.48km/s. This will give us an estimate of how much energy will be required to throw a chunk that fast. $K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=1.095\times 10^{6}m$ joules, so for a mass to throw an equal mass with that much energy, it must be able to use 1.095 MJ/kg in a very short amount of time. However, that's almost within an order of magnitude of the total energy stored by carbohydrates. So basically the entire chunk has to consist of readily available energy storage and mechanism to propel itself forward. Already this is very much stretching the bounds of plausibility, but this is the only way that it's going to work. If 2/3 of a chunk propelled 1/3 forward, only $\frac{1}{3^{29}}\approx 1.4\times 10^{-14}$ of the original would remain, so using the entire biomass of the Earth would get 58kg (about two cubic feet) of the cube out of the solar system. Also, these cubes won't be roaring out of the solar system - by the time they left the solar system they'd be going around 800m/s. So they could potentially get to the next closest star after 50 trillion years. That's long after the destination star will have died. Another way in which this gets worse for your blob is that 1.48km/s is actually sort of like the speed of light - it would actually require more and more energy to just get closer and closer to that limit. It's likely that getting to half of that, 740m/s, would take as much energy as what my simplification allowed to get to 1.48km/s. So it would require twice as many chunk-throwing-chunk steps, which squares the mass reduction - $\frac{1}{2^{57}}\approx 1.7\times 10^{-18}$ of the original mass could escape the solar system. Oh, and remember how we completely ignored escaping the Earth's gravity well? Yeah, that problem wouldn't go away even if the blob consumed the entire Earth, rocks and all, because that doesn't somehow destroy the gravity well. 

In the next paragraph, it talks more about how we react to people in our monkeysphere vs. those outside of it: 

Unaided, you're out of luck. You'd need a pressure suit and an oxygen supply or a tank of breathable handwavium air in order to make this work. 

If I haven't made it clear already, an oxygen cylinder is not a good idea. So why is freediving better? It doesn't have any of the above problems! 

Which government is responsible? The one in charge of the area. In contested areas (such as during a civil war), I'm not sure how this would work. Those areas are not the focus of this question, though. 

No 31.4% CO2 is way too high. According to Wikipedia, you can last about 0.1 hours in 7% CO2, and that's even when there's otherwise enough oxygen in the air. I think plants would be able to survive it, so if you seed the planet with enough plant life you could bring down the CO2 levels to make it habitable within a century or two. The SO2 levels are also way too high, and I'm not sure how you'd take care of those. Based on the Wikipedia page for SO2, a safe level is 75 parts per billion (0.0000075% instead of your 0.136%). "Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to acid rain", so this also makes it harder for plants to grow, making it harder for you to get rid of the CO2. 

I think that all of these events are going to quickly get a lot of attention, both from the government and from the public. The government's response is going to depend a lot on how people are reacting to this. 

My first thought when I read How can I hide my island? was that if the villain is being tracked by satellite imagery, they should just go to the island via submarine. But then I realized I don't actually know how easy it is to hide using a submarine. So, how hard would it be to track someone who is trying to disappear using their own submarine? I can think of two technologies for tracking off the top of my head (as well as questions about their limitations): 

Are you familiar with the Fermi paradox? It asks why the Earth hasn't already been (convincingly) visited by aliens - there are so many suns and planets older than the Earth, that aliens should be ridiculously more common than what we observe. One explanation for this is that there is at least one (and quite possibly more than one) significant hurdle along the path of the development of intelligent life capable of colonizing more than just their own solar system. If the hurdles are behind us, then we're good to go. For example, if it is extremely rare for life to develop at all, or for multicellular life to develop at all, then it might only be smooth sailing between humanity and galactic colonization. But what if it's fairly common for life to reach the stage that we're at now? That means there is likely some apocalypse coming that is almost impossible for intelligent life to avoid. So here's the plan - I'm going to start a secret society specifically for preventing humanity from being stopped by oncoming hurdles. But how do I do it? Requirements for the secret society: 

If you're not familiar with it, you should check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series. You've pretty much described the setting of those books, the planet Pern. There is another planet in Pern's solar system with an elliptical 250 year orbit. At the far end of its orbit it reaches the system's Oort cloud, pulling material into the inner solar system and into the path of Pern's orbit. The result is that for 50 years of the 250 year cycle Pern gets showered with material from the Oort cloud. The surveyors (and subsequent colonists) were aware of this, but meteor showers aren't particularly worrisome. However, the material from the Oort cloud doesn't just form harmless meteor showers - it contains what they call thread, "thin silver filaments of a space-borne mycorrhizoid spore that devours all organic matter that it touches". In short, a deadly rain. However it doesn't completely destroy the natural flora and fauna - they've adapted to the situation such that enough survive threadfall and are able to bounce back quickly enough that the survey team coming a few decades into the 200-year gap didn't see anything concerning. In the books, the settlers stick around because 1) their voyage was intentionally one-way so they have no choice and 2) the planet has miniature, fire-breathing, teleporting dragons that they are able to genetically modify into a rideable size. 

In short, there's no real reason to assume that commonness and familiarity with hallucinations would make them any less liable to be interpreted religiously than dreams have been. 

One alternative solution comes from looking closely at the law of Conservation of Energy: "Energy, within a closed system, will remain the same." - so just avoid a closed system. Magical energy can be sourced from somewhere outside the regular universe (such as from a parallel universe that has different laws of physics). This means that people with magical ability have an inborn connection to the source of magic, with the strength of the connection dictating how much energy they can pull through at a time. 

Something important to keep in mind is how much land it takes to sustainably feed someone. If you Google "how much land does it take to feed someone", the results say that it takes about 1 acre to feed one person. 2 square miles is 1280 acres. This means that if the land is arable (farmable), then you could potentially feed 1280. Because "the ground is mostly made of stone", this isn't arable land. That means plants won't grow without a lot of work. Also, it will be very dry—tundra is naturally quite dry (cold air doesn't hold water very well), and when that cold dry air comes in and becomes warm dry air it will be able to absorb more water, leaving the warm area drier than it was before. When that air leaves the warm area it will want to release its water, so the surrounding tundra might get a little bit more rain/snow than normal. So to get anything to grow, people would have to do a lot of work to prepare the ground to allow plants to grow. Then, they would have to continually bring in all the water that the plants need in order to grow. Even if you could prepare the ground and bring in enough water, I have no clue what these conditions would do to plants. I wouldn't be surprised if having the temperature stay about the same even at night would seriously mess up their growth cycles. Also, don't expect plants to be able to grow at full speed year-round—even though it will be warm in the winter, the amount of sunlight they get will be minimal. This might actually cause them to be unable to survive the winter, as the temperature will not let them go into hibernation but they will not get enough light to live. However, since we're already dealing with a magic stone, you can handwave as many of these problems away as you wish. In summary, there is enough land to be able to support over a thousand people. If the stone does nothing but make it warm, it would still be a massive undertaking to be able to live there. You can make a decision about how livable you want the area to be, and then allow the magic stone to help plants grow enough to make up the difference.
