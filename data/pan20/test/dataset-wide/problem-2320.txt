source to give you an idea of the comparision GoreTex has a minimum hydorstatic head test rating of 20,000mm (when new). So that jacket is 10x less waterproof than GoreTex. Is this an issue? For occasional use in normal conditions, no. If your planing on hiking up a Scotish Munroe in autumn (literally the wettest place on earth from my experience), I would want something better. 

In humans not a lot. There are significant differences between blubber and fat. Though blubber is mostly made of fat it has very different composition to human fat. An animal with blubber also uses it in very different ways to the way a human uses fat. Fat in a human is an energy source, not insulation: 

If I'm using two prusik's to climb a rope (one as a foot loop and one attached to harness directly) What's the minimum diameter of cord I should be looking for to remain safe? 

If your putting it away for a long period of time I like to coat the blade in oil. The oil will repel any moisture and stop it rusting. Overtime the oil will evaporate, if you use quite a thick oil (or grease) it will last longer. You'll still likely want to give it a quick sharpen (as well as a polish and clean) when you first use it. 

I've seen several down jackets stating what species of down the jacket is filled with, i.e. Duck, Goose, etc. What are the differences between the various species' down and which is best? 

I'm going snowboarding in a couple of months and I'm hideously out of practice/not very good. I remember when I last had lesson the instructor talked about how I should twist the board with my feet as I turn but TBH I never really got what he was trying to explain. Can anyone explain this? It'd be nice to understand the theory before I start practising again. 

Dry ropes and dry-core ropes are very similar. Basically they've been treated so they repel water (this does not make them water proof). "Wet" ropes have no treatment. 

A lot of climbing gyms (especially bouldering ones) have traversing walls. If you can find one of these practice there. 

The masters of this are obviously the Mongols. In the 13th Century their mounted cavalry were the most feared warriors in the world. They began training for this, pretty much, as soon as they could mount a horse. They would often time the release of the bow to the exact moment that all 4 of the horses legs would leave the ground therefore giving them the most stable platform. 

Generally organised groups and companies stick to well established rivers, this limits the impact to a few rivers (which do actually suffer quite badly for this but at least it's only a few rivers and not lots of rivers!). New rivers are not and should not be advertised, if it attracts large groups it can cause severe damage to the ecosystem. 

I'm currently in the process of getting together a winter walking kit. I've got B2 boots and I'm buying suitable crampons. Ice Axes though seems more...confusing. What kind of features should I be looking for? I'm not planning on ice climbing, simply winter use on ridges, mountain tops in Scotland/Alpine walking. 

A note on gorge scrambling. It's common (in the UK at least) to use ropes while gorge scrambling. This is fine as they are typically confidence ropes and will be under static load (as opposed to dynamic falling loads) 

Build a rough route card, where you plan to be and when. Give it to someone you trust who will keep track of you. That way if you get into serious trouble and can't get help yourself there will be someone to raise the alarm. Better than lying in a ditch with no hope of rescue... 

Your best bet is to study an Ordance Survey map of the area. Incidently you can get these off Bing which is cool. I'd look for a campsite symbol with some form of forest near by: Preferably deciduous forest, which will have well spaced out trees, forestry commision land tends to be densely packed: 

I'm talking about a single "alpine walking axe" here, not a pair of climbing axes. (I presume this is what you mean?) For me it's pretty strightforward: Pro It stops you dropping your axe (or more to the point if you do drop it you won't loose it) Cons It's a pain and gets in the way (just generally in my experience) It makes swapping hands more difficult (you have to remove the leash put the leash on the other hand, etc) 

The only knot that's I'm aware of that's any good at securing straps like that is a water knot. though I'm not convinced it's going to work in your case. You don't have a lot of slack, it tends to slip and it's not very adjustable. 

One important thing to bear in mind (and the main reason I've never ridden my mountain bike on the beach) is the effect of sand and salt water on all your parts and the frame itself. The sand is going to clog everything up (bottom bracket, gears and cassette are going to take the brunt of this) and the salt water is going to make everything rust, including your frame. I'd only do this on an old banger, I certainly wouldn't take your Â£3k full bounce mountain bike onto the beach. If you don't want the bike to eventually seize up I'd strip the whole thing down and clean everything out (thoroughly) often. Pay particular attention to the bottom bracket, cassette and de-raillers. Remove them from the bike. Clean them and their housings out, I'm talking power washer here. Greases and oil them thoroughly and put them back in..... Then probably oil them again. If you do get salt water into the frame your going to have a hell of a time getting it out and all the time it's in their it's going to corrode everything. 

The best way to prevent sweat in a winter jacket is to use a breathable layering system. Base Layer Tight fitting wicking material that sits close to your skin. The layers job is to wick the moisture off your skin ASAP. Several good materials for this depending on your circumstances mostly polyester or wool. Do not use cotton! Cotton does not wick well. Breathable insulation layer(s) Your insulation layers are there to keep you warm. If they get wet though they aren't going to be able to do this effectivly. So once the base layer has removed sweat from your skin it need to get out of your system. Good example of this is a breathable fleece. Multiple layers can be worn depending on how cold it is and you can alter the number of layers depending on how much work your doing. Breathable Water proof layer Something like GoreTex or it's equivalents. 

So stretch and stretch well (even if your exhausted). I recently did a long distance walk and I was too tired to stretch in the evening. Worst decision I've ever made. I woke up after about an hour of sleep, I thought I'd torn my hamstring. I actually asked my girlfriend to take me to A&E. Turns out it was just severe cramp. Hopefully before you get to to this point you should of carb loaded. If you've got a break you likely need to do this again. It's tricky one TBH. You need to get some more energy on-board but you want this to be something that your body can quickly transfer to energy. To raise your reserves back up. If you haven't done enough prep getting energy into your system don't expect to make up for it now. It's too late. Rest, lot's. Try and get a good nights sleep for as long as you can.
