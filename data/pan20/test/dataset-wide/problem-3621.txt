I have been running for about 20 years, mostly 10-21 km over the past few years. This past year I've transitioned into running in Vibrams - in the simplest model I found - and about two month ago I stopped running in "regular" shoes altogether. typically jog for the first few km, and then speed up for the last 5.5 km of my run, which is done on a flat, paved bike path/pedestrian walkway. I have more than a hundred times for this particular section, and since I started running it in the Vibrams, my average time has dropped dramatically. I'd say that for the past year, I've been doing it in 26-30 minutes, and in the past month from 25-27. Furthermore, in the past my times were all over the place- on a bad day I'd end up jogging it (hence 30 minutes) and on a good day it could be 26. In the Vibrams it feels like I can't really slack off and jog slowly, even on days I feel lackluster. Does this make sense? Do minimalist running shoes force you into better form and improve your times? 

Besides this answer, I recommend their site- they have lots of diagrams and videos as well. A great resource for people considering taking up barefoot running. 

I've heard that running with weights is a bad idea. Most of what I've read online (for example, this) seems to suggest unequivocally that weights on your legs are a serious health risk, but there seems to be a little less consensus about weights held in your hands. My assumption was that it would be good for toning my shoulders and arms. I had been running with 450 gm weights for a few years- holding them in my hand, not around my wrist, usually between 7 and 15 km (at about a 5 min/km pace). But after reading about it online I decided to stop temporarily, even though I hadn't experienced any negative side effects. I'd appreciate links/evidence one way or the other, preferably not just anecdotal. 

Ive read that most climbers have a lot of muscle imbalances, including some that affect proper posture. 

The first and best way to check if youre doing something wrong is to check your progress. If you find yourself on a plateau, then probably someting is wrong. What are your weekly/monthly weight increments? Have you failed to meet them? If not, youre probably doing fine. As for the soreness, a bit of stretching after the workout wouldnt hurt. Also some mild activity in the regeneration phase. Try walking to work instead of using the car, or simply have a walk when the soreness kicks in. It will improve the bloodflow and help the muscle regenarate. Dont push it too hard tho - remember that you are resting. Also make sure youre eating enough protein. Bad diet could also be a cause of slower/no progress. You might want to try changing your traning program to whole body workouts 3 times a week. You probably will see quicker results by doing so, and the legs would get their workout more often - they could accomodate to the stress, and your DOMS shouldnt be so bad. As far as I know, the one-bodypart-a-day training programs are quite specific and targeted at advanced bodybuilders. It seems to me you are just trying to get/keep fit, and for that purpose, a whole body training program might do a better job. On a side note, I think you should focus on free weights wherever possible. I see you are doing a lot of machine exercises. Machines look all fancy and cool, and make it very hard to hurt yourself while using them, but make it very easy to hurt yourself when doing some actual real life lifting. The machines are designed to force a particular movement. Your big muscles are doing the work and they get stronger, but the little stabilizing muscles have nothing to do, since the machine keeps the weight steady and makes it move the correct way. The stabilizing muscles are weak, and when you try to lift something heavy, they cannot hold everything in place as they are sopposed to and bam!, you end up with an injury. Try to get a specialist to teach you proper form and try doing freeweight exercises. They are better for you :) 

I'm trying to make barbell loadable atlas stones that have accurate weights. Like, say, 50lbs, 100lbs, and 200lbs. It's hard to accurately calibrate the weight of atlas stones I would imagine as their weight goes down as the cement dries over time, but certainly it can be estimated vis-a-vis the volume. Anyway, that's the weeds, ideally I'd make a custom mold with 50mm diameter cylinder passing through the center, but what I have is a solid atlas stone, and I'm thinking I can bore a 50mm hole with a masonry bit I actually already have with my large drill press, but once the hole is drilled, how then can I calibrate the weight to be heavier or lighter to have precise standard weights in 50lbs, 100lbs, and 200lbs? 

Do you remember Vinnie Jones "The Sphinx" in Gone in Sixty Seconds? Well, here he is laying out an obese person. But, this is probably a different kind of strength than what you're referring to. If you're heavy, you're probably not a "strong" box jumper, or a "strong" runner, and you might not be able to do as many pull ups or dips, or even upside down pushups. What is obese? What is slender? Is it body fat percentage? I get what you're saying, but "strength" is kinda too vague. You need to hone that down a bit. Yes, Hossein Rezazadeh is obese, and yes he snatched 213kg. An absolute monster. But Clarence Kennedy's got a 187.5kg snatch and probably has a really low body fat percentage. My vote is "no." Fatness does not translate to strength. There may be relative exceptions, but on the whole, no way. If Hossein had trained down his body fat to a Pyrros Dimas-level physique, I bet he'd'a snatched 220kg+. This individual's obese-to-slender transition happened over the course of probably 5+ years (2002-2007+), plus when was this article written? You're going to naturally loose strength as a function of your age, and if you're going from "obese no exercise" to full blown exercise maniac, then it's going to wear on your body, especially if you're overweight to begin with, and make you less strong. That said, the strength this individual had then was probably just a consequence of their youth. Are there exceptions? Of course. There's always exceptions. You need a definition of strength. You need a definition of obese and slender. You need a method of comparison. You need participants in such a study in high numbers for both groups. Is it by age, weight, body fat percentage, a ratio of all three? Where on Earth are you going to find such a study? Guessing is all that can be provided unless there are such statistics on historic Olympic athletes. Do those data exist? Prove me wrong. 

Actually, I have a similar problem, and I have asked about related things erlier on this site - check those questions out (deadlifts with hyperlordosis). I also consulted a friend who studied physical theraphy. She gave me a bit of advice: 

Some even say that stretching pre-workout lowering your max performance in strength training! I cant find those studies right now, but If you ask me, science says that stretching pre-exercise does not help prevent injuries or limit the DOMS one may experience after the workout. So for the sake of your question, because we cant prove that stretching is useful, we can skip even without checking if it actually has some negative side effects, like Jillian Michaels suggests (and Im pretty sure it does). This goes for pre and post-workout stretching, not stretching as a standalone. Im stretching too, but it serves diferent goals (I have too tight pectoral muscles and need to stretch them to help maintain good posture). I do both static and dynamic stretches to increase my range of motion and accustom some of my overtightened muscles to being in the neutral state, but I do it on non training days and in the morning. Also, remember to do a proper warmup before doing any streneous exercises - warmups have been proven to be beneficial! 

What is the best way to do pectoral stretches? A specialist recommended that besides avoiding bench presses and strengthening my back, I should stretch my pectoral muscles as often as possible, as they have grown accustomed to being in a shortened state and will actively try to make me slouch. Preferably those stretches should use no equipment.
