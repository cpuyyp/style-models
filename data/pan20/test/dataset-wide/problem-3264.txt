Yes, Horst Tappert was a member of the Waffen SS. There is no doubt of that. What historian Jan Erik Schulte may be referring to is whether he might have been "pressured or coerced" into joining the SS. Tappert never mentioned the fact of his SS membership in public. However, unlike German author and Literature Nobel winner Günter Grass, he did not pretend to be a brave fighter against fascism while keeping quiet about his war record. Earlier this month, Germany public TV broadcaster ZDF announced that it would not broadcast any more reruns of "Derrick", the detective series that had made Tappert famous. In the Netherlands, "public television channel Omroep MAX said it had scrapped plans to show around 20 episodes of Derrick from July." (BBC). Tappert was an actor, but his character Inspector Derrick was the creature of Herbert Reinecker, Germany's most prolific TV screenwriter for decades. Reinecker had been a fervent Nazi from the start. He, too, was in the SS (in the same Totenkopf division as Tappert), but he also had a career as an influential propagandist, beating the drums of war from 1935 when he joined the Reich propaganda ministry right up until the last month of fighting in 1945. The link in the paragraph above goes to a a German-language article in Die Welt from 2011 reviewing a book analyzing Reinecker's war and post-war careers. The author of the book concludes that Reinecker -- who never made a secret of having been in the SS -- remained an apologist for Nazi crimes after WW II, without being explicit about it. Episode after episode of "Derrick" and other TV shows written by Reinecker features protagonists who run afoul of the law with the best intentions. The tragic dimension in crime was also explored by other writers such as Georges Simenon, creator of Inspector Maigret. But Reinecker's writing frequently was barely more than a coded apologetics to vicariously absolve Nazis in particular, and Germany as a nation, of historical guilt. Many episodes condemn the "dredging up of the past" -- again, without explicitly referencing Nazism or WW II, but the underlying message was nonetheless appreciated by the viewership, in a wordless kind of way. It is unclear whether Mr. Tappert understood this. He was not known for being an intellectual. His appeal as an actor came from an understated virility and his ability to credibly represent the power of the state to catch criminals, a comforting notion to people all over the world. Yet even Tappert is said to have recoiled at playing Derrick in what was to have been the final episode of the series. According to a 1999 report in Berliner Zeitung, that episode was to feature a photograph of the infamous ramp in the Auschwitz death camp in the service of an abstruse plot about a Ph.D. madman who induces young people to suicide by showing them scenes of great horror. Apparently, such a cynical use of the Holocaust was too much for Tappert and he refused; the episode was never produced.

A collection of 68 of his set drawings is shown on European Film Gateway, with about two dozen of them from Die Nibelungen. While none of them feature the striking wall patterns of the movie sets, I believe it is a safe assumption that Hunte both drew from historical medieval ornamental art and at the same time took care to maximize contrast so that they would come out as vivid as possible on black-and-white film stock. The costume designer is usually credited as Paul Gerd Guderian. However, according to this weblog by British film maker David Cairns, 

It was recently reported that German TV actor Horst Tappert (1923 - 2008) had been identified as having been a member of the Waffen SS in World War II. However, it was also reported that a German historian had said that the circumstances of his SS membership remain unclear. What are the facts? Was he or was he not in the SS? 

There were air raids in WWII which according to Wikipedia destroyed 18 percent of the city. However, that is much less than the destruction wrought on Frankfurt am Main, 30 miles to the east, which saw 70 percent destroyed by allied bombing raids. 

You betcha! In fact, the movie was rather mild. The most famous incident in the Congress (comprising the Senate and the House of Representatives) was the caning of Senator Sumner: 

Perhaps German chancellor Angela Merkel and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble. In 1999 Schäuble served not only as chairman of the Christian Democrats' faction in parliament, he was also chairman of the CDU and the front-runner to be nominated his party's candidate for chancellor. Angela Merkel was then CDU general secretary, a lesser rank in the party hierarchy. Former chancellor Helmut Kohl had officially retired but was still pulling strings in the background. During the 1999 payola scandal affecting the CDU, Merkel stunned everyone by having an op-ed published that essentially consigned Kohl to the scrap heap of history. She had not asked Schäuble for authorization beforehand. It was an audacious move but Schäuble, who like Kohl had been compromised by the CDU's financial scandal, was too weak to punish her. From that moment, the mantle of crown prince and future chancellor was shifted from Schäuble to Merkel. The CDU won the 2005 election and ever since, Schäuble -- who is 12 years Merkel's senior -- has loyally served as a Minister in her cabinet. 

I recommend going to Wikipedia's page on the Holocaust. You have two options. One is to read the article, which is a bit tedious. That is inevitable when you crowdsource the writing of an encyclopedia. On the other hand, that article is among the most watched of all articles on the Wikipedia, so it is unlikely for misinformation to remain in there for long. The other option would be to skip the entire article body, go straight to its bibliography. Then spend two weeks working through the sources, making sure you also hit the library for paper sources that are not online. If you can find a concentration camp survivor to tell you of their experiences in person, very good: after all, it was not columns of numbers but living, breathing people who were shoved into the cattle cars. But there aren't many left. If not, watch some survivor videos recorded by the Shoah Foundation. Read the pre-eminent scholars: Hilberg, Broszat, Browning, Evans, Friedländer, Kershaw, Lipstadt... Pay attention to where they agree and where they disagree. For contrast, briefly descend into evil/insanity/stupidity by reading David Irving and others of his ilk. If after that you still have doubts that Nazi Germany, together with collaborators in allied nations, waged a campaign of extermination against the Jews and managed to kill more than two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population, then I don't know what more to say to you. 

The production designer for Die Nibelungen was the enormously creative Otto Hunte (b. 1881 d. 1960). In this photograph he is seen standing at far right, next to Fritz Lang. He was also in charge of production design for Metropolis, Der blaue Engel, Die drei von der Tankstelle and other classics of German cinema, sadly also including the Nazi big-budget production Jud Süß. In the group photograph, we can see clearly the striking geometric designs that he created for part 2 of Die Nibelungen. They employ a mix of concentric designs, diamond shapes, and figure-ground reversals. To my unschooled eye, they appear to be severely simplified idealizations of Gothic or Gothic Revival Style. 

A perusal of the French Wikipedia article on Charles, however, paints a somewhat different picture of that day at Montlhéry in 1465. It says that during a fight marked by inept tactics on both sides, the left flank of the Royal army had turned tail before battle was joined, that Charles "seeing himself as already victorious" gave chase and pursued them far from the actual battlefield, thus missing the action there; and that King Louis had in fact declared himself the victor as he had been able to withdraw his force largely unscathed to within the ramparts of Paris. That article also quotes de Commynes as writing that ever since that victory, the Duke of Charolais (the future Charles the Bold) was so convinced of his tactical genius that he refused all advice. 

Source: www.senate.gov That incident, as noted, took place on the Senate floor. But while less famous (or rather, infamous), heated and even violent encounters did take place in the House as well. As in the caning of Sen. Sumner, slavery provided the backdrop for one of them. On February 6th, 1858, Galusha Grow (R-PA) and a number of his colleagues came to blows.

Charles was not one to stay back in a tent while his troops fought and died, he took part himself. His death in 1477 came on the battlefield, at the end of a clash in which he over-ruled the counsel of his officers and stood his ground against a superior attacking force (in Nancy).

In 1456 Charles took over the reins from his ailing father. He soon found himself locked in conflict with Louis XI, the King of France. On 16 July 1465 their armies clashed at Montlhéry near Paris. The Duke's Burgundian forces carried the day in what was said to be an impressive victory over numerically inferior French foes. Philippe de Commynes: 

Lebe suggests that this was the day that the heir apparent Charles of Burgund turned into Charles the Bold. He writes that Charles fought like a man possessed, driving his men forward, collecting them for one bloody skirmish after another. Again, quoting Commynes:
