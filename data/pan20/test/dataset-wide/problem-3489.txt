Yes, but only if you also introduce capital controls. You should check out the Mundellâ€“Fleming trilemma: 

I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is, as a matter of US law, cash is not a security because it is explicitly exempted under The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: 

The good itself is more expensive The household is poorer because they can no longer afford their old consumption bundle. 

The definition of the expenditure measure of GDP is: $$GDP_{EXP} \equiv C + I_g + G + X_n$$ The definition of the expenditure income measure of GDP is: $$GDP_{income} \equiv I_n - I_f - C_c$$ As I understand it, $s$ is not part of it. $s$ is defined as the difference between the two measures: $$s \equiv GDP_{EXP} - GDP_{income}$$ Apparently it is also possible to define it with the RIPSAW approach: $$GDP_{income} \equiv R + I + P + S + A + W$$ R = rents, I = interests, P = profits, SA = statistical adjustments (corporate income taxes, dividends, undistributed corporate profits, and W = wages. And yes, it is useful to calculate GDP with multiple methods. Among other things, it reduces noise in GDP estimates: 

One way this can happen is if the firm's leadership is in a position to prevent liquidation. This happens a lot in closed end mutual funds. The mutual funds are worth less than liquidation value because the managers of the fund are in a position to block the liquidation and have an incentive to do so in order to protect their fees. See Discounts and Premiums on Closed-End Mutual Funds: A Study in Valuation by Kenneth J. Boudreaux for a detail exploration of this topic, though he finds that the fees are too small for this to be a plausible explanation for observed discounts below liquidation. 

One possibility is basing it on the bail bond system, paying a recovery fee for rescuing distressed people in certain circumstances. The United States is unusual in having a private bounty hunting system. Under such a system, bounty hunters receive a bounty for carrying out arrests for those who have skipped bail. Bail is a kind of surety bond which you post to the court to go free between indictment and the outcome at trial. The bails are often large and therefore borrowed from bail bondsmen. If the defendant fails to show up for their trial then the bond is held until they do and eventually forfeited. Good conduct is often controlled through a licensing system. Problem here is such disasters may be infrequent enough that people won't bother having the license. There are also several US states that have wildlife bounties, typically for vermin animals. For example, in Michigan hunters can receive \$0.10 per rat they kill. So you could just have a similar system for rescued people. This is a like the above suggestion, but without a licensing requirement. The worry here is that people may scheme to put themselves in harm's way to get the bounty paid to others. Another possibility is something like a "posse comitatus is the common-law or statute law authority of a county sheriff, or other law officer, to conscript any able-bodied man to assist him in keeping the peace or to pursue and arrest a felon.]3" In Kopel (2015) (see starting page 71) many states compensate members of the posse and other deputized citizens for their service analogously to jury service. Under this model Cajuan Navy members would present themselves to law enforcement, show they had the proper equipment and preparation, and then be deputized to help, providing compensation and indemnification. 

While the prices of equities do fluctuate in response to information about the underlying enterprises, this is not the first order or likely even second order reason why they do so. 

You can read what looks like the entire collection of back issues of Survey of Current Business on the BEA website but the old issues seem to be PDFs that are not indexed by the site's search engine. You can see the 1995 revision discussed there. This seems to be the 1965 and 1980 revisions. The seem to have changed the termenology on the major revisions at one point. In 1980 the called it The National Income and Product Accounts of the United States: An Introduction to the Revised Estimates for 1929-80 instead of Preview of the Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts which they called in since at least 1995. That still leaves five more still to discover. I set my DownThemAll to download the whole archive and then I'll see if can get anywhere with searching the pdfs. 

The cuisine and fashion industries both largely exist without intellectual property protection other than trademarks (n.b., they can use copyright on certain aspects of their work but this is generally thought to give little protection) yet they seem to flourish. How is this possible? In fashion, it is thought that copying the work of other designers can be good for everyone, allowing the industry to have a color of the year and products like bags and dresses at various quality, fit, and price levels. There may be related forces at play in cuisine. It is difficult to imagine the Cronut fad lasting as long as it did without other bakeries making very similar efforts to keep customers interested and the product in the news. This is only one mechanism. Another mechanism giving rise to negative outcomes is barriers to entry. Think of patents as raising the returns and costs both to entry into an industry. They raise returns because conditional on getting greater IP protection you have more economic rents from your IP based monopoly. But because others already have these heavy protections the cost to a new entrant of innovating and litigating in a way that permits entry to the industry will be much higher. The consensus seems to be that at some point the marginal benefits of greater protection fall faster than the marginal costs of entry increase, leading to something like the Tabarrok Curve for patent protection: 

GDP is the sum of wages and capital income. In most developed economies, 2/3rds of GDP is wages (income and other compensation) and the remainder is capital income (owner occupied rents, interest and dividends mostly). This ratio is difficult to measure precisely but the general consensus is that it has been mostly but not perfectly stable over time. 

And in reality, the situation is much worse because there are many investments, taxes, transaction costs, behavioral issues, and rational-inattention. I'm sure you could simplify and cook up a theoretical setting where you could do this (for one, just assume that all the other things cannot change), but in general this won't be possible. 

Source: Policonomics This shows that through trade both Portugal and England can have more wine and more cloth after opening up trade between the countries. It also shows that even if Portugal is more productive than England at producing both commodities then trade is still improving (that is what makes it comparative and not absolute advantage). Alternatively, perhaps you mean a 2x2 table like this which shows the labor needed to produce each good: 

In the example in the question above, as in the problem of the price change of the oranges in the comment on @EnergyNumbers's answer, test 1 is satisfied. The question remaining is is test 2 also satisfied. The price of the land under the new building is priced to include development rights. The price of the existing building is lower because of those development rights. But, you say, the price dropped when you actually built it! Is that enough? That's also exactly what you would expect to happen if the purchase price included a bet on when the other building would be built. If construction is increasing in rents, then should we view the construction as simply a pecuniary externality no different than if lower rents had decreased the value of the existing structure? What's also tricky about views is that they aren't destroyed so much as transferred by the new construction. So it isn't as though , in MWG's example like the pollution kills the fish, it is more like one group of fishermen decide to fish upstream from another group of fishermen. That certainly isn't good for the latter group but makes it seem much more like a pecuniary externality where another worker takes your job by being willing to work for less or another buyer takes your orange by being willing to pay more for it. 

Collateral and margin requirements: When you sell a derivative to a intermediary you are required to post assets, in a quantity related to the size of the position and the risk of a large move in the derivative's value, in order to ensure that you are will be able to pay when required. Credit risk management: Management at intermediaries sets limits on how much derivative business can be done with an individual firm, related to its capacity to bear losses from capital and additional borrowing capacity. This limit the losses from an individual counter-parties. Central counterparty clearing house (CCP) and novation: CCPs can provide additional capital to make good on claims even if the counter party fails to do so. Central clearing can also make sure that situations like those where A fails to pay B, who then fails to pay C, who then fails to pay A do no occur. So it can eliminate a lot of senseless defaults that generate real costs and collateral changing hands to not good purpose Hedging: When a derivative has substantial jump risk and that jump risk is difficult to measure it may be costly or difficult to have the right amount of collateral. In that case it may superior to just use other financial instruments to insure against the jump directly through position risk management (hedging). 

Additionally, it is hard to remember from the perspective of the present how devoid of theory was corporate finance in the period before Modigliani and Miller. Here's a quote from an award ceremony speech related to the Nobel award: 

There is a book, The Halo Effect: . . . and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers (Rosenzweig (2007)), that highlights the methodological problems with a number of prominent management theory books including In search of excellence : lessons from America's best-run companies, Good to Great and Built to Last. They mostly amount to problems with selection bias. 

I don't know that the distribution you claim is wrong but it strikes me as having a couple of very undesirable features. For one, virtually the entire population all of the has >0.99 MPC, which seems very high for a distribution you think is centered around 3/4. For another, if you think that the income shocks in your model are transitory rather than permanent, my reading of the literature is that these are way too large. But that's all separate from your question about estimating things conditional on the actual MPC distribution and ordering. Ordering from low to high MPC seems to take a strong stance on how trade works in the economy. Again, I don't know that is wrong but it doesn't strike me as true. If we think that MPC is caused by income then this is akin to saying the richest guy get the money first, spends some it at the second richest guy's store and saves the rest, he spends the spending of guy 1 at the third richest guy and so on. The economy strikes me as less neat than that and so a random ordering makes more sense to me in the absence of evidence about where high vs. low MPC people spend their money. I tried messing around with simulations (in Python) to see how well we could approximate these random chains of consumption. In general, experimenting a few parameter values with uniform, beta, and your distribution above, distribution doesn't matter so much in determining total consumption effect. Using the geometric or arithmetic means of the MPC distribution give nice approximations of actual total consumption effect from the random chains of consumption.* On the other hand, if you order the households by MPC from high to low or low to high this makes a huge difference in the resulting total consumption effects. * - That said, I explicitly ruled out distributions of MPC where MPC can be zero (or less). If that happens the geometric mean will be zero and the resulting approximation using the geometric mean quite poor. Code:
