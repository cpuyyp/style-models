On the Second Day of the Battle of Gettysburg, the Third Confederate Brigade under Brig. Gen. Ambrose Wright (serving under Anderson's Division) charged from Seminary Ridge into Union forces holding Cemetery Ridge, overrunning two batteries of Union guns and nearly capturing Meade's headquarters. My great great grandfather was a lieutenant in the 48th Georgia Infantry which fought on Wright's left flank. To their left was Brig. Carnot Posey's brigade of Mississippians who, except for elements of a few companies, did not advance onto the ridge to protect Wright's left flank. The Georgian's hollared, "Come on you Mississippians," but they wouldn't budge because Posey had given no orders to. After the Battle, Anderson took the blame for not giving Posey adequate discretion, but the question is, what would have happened if Posey had joined the battle? Reportedly, Wright's forces went further than Pickett's "high water mark" on Day 3 of the battle, but was forced to retreat when the 48th and other units took heavy casualties (my ancestor was wounded). Have any military experts studied this to see whether Posey's forced might have won the entire battle for the South on Day 2? 

The American surrender of Wainwright's and Sharp's forces in the Philippines, during World War II, was the largest surrender of troops under the US flag in the history of the country. Reports at the time stated that US and Filipino troops were fighting hunger and illness in addition to the Japanese, and that there was no chance that the US could get supplies to them, given Japan's command of the seas at that point. However, American troops who refused to surrender, such as Col. Wendell Fertig, working with other American soldiers, organized Filipino resistence fighters into an effective insurgency of approximately 36,000 troops. By doing so, he caused the Japanese to divert 60,000 troops to Mindano in an unsuccessful attempt to crush the insurgency. Moreover, Fertig's insurgency force became one of the most effective intelligence sources available to MacArthur in that area. The supply problems that led Wainwright to surrender were largely solved by Fertig, an engineer, who creatively used native crops and materials, and salvaged allied and enemy stores and weapons, to supply, equip, and feed his forces. See John Keats, They Fought Alone: Wendell Fertig and the World War II Guerrilla Campaign in the Philippines, (J. B. Lippincott Company) (1963). Given that the US Army had relatively recent experience fighting against insurgencies in Central America (i.e. the Banana Wars), did it occur to MacArthur or his staff that Wainwright's and Sharp's forces would have been better off heading for the hills and fighting a guerrilla war, rather than surrendering? If not, what factors made MacArthur and his staff choose surrender instead? 

Some of these sources are quoted in this article about hair in Jewish sources by Miriam Samuel (Hebrew). While these sources mostly point to short hair for adults, it should also be noted that while women's dress was forbidden to Jewish men (based on Deuteronomy 22:5), there is no discussion of long hair in this context in rabbinic sources, which might also show that it wasn't entirely unusual for men to have long hair. However, an explicit statement on the subject can be found in the writings of Paul the Apostle (I Corinthians 11:14-15), who views short hair as natural for a man and long hair as natural for a woman (however, while Paul was in Jerusalem for some time, he was from Tarsus and didn't stay in Judea). One possible contemporary picture of a Judean is one bust identified, probably incorrectly, as that of Josephus, who was born in Judah and later moved to Rome. Even if Josephus is depicted, it's unclear whether the hairstyle reflects a Judean fashion, or if it was changed to match his later Roman neighbors, but the hairstyle does in fact have a close haircut with no bangs. (I left this paragraph here because it appeared it a previous version of the answer, but the source linked to above claims the identification with Josephus is baseless.) 

There is no clear source about the maximum length of hair known to me, but it's possible to glean information from some related topics. 

Mesha's father's name was most likely כמשית kmšyt. The missing letters in Mesha's father's name were supplied only by various conjectures. M. Clermont-Ganneau, in a publication from 1887 ("La stèle de Mésa: examen critique du texte" p. 18), quotes different readings: כמשנדב kmšndb, כמשגד kmšgd, כמשמלכ kmšmlk (a name meaning "Chemosh is king," not "King Chemosh"). However, they were all supported by names from Assyrian and Ammonite documents that quoted those names or similar names, or by pure guesses. The first epigraphic evidence came from the El-Kerak inscription, discovered in 1958, which starts: 

Disclaimer: this is less an answer about the history but about the chemistry of dish washing - which I hope will serve as complementary info on some of the other answers. I think a few points of chemical background may help understanding the historical solutions to the dishwashing question. With the exception of burnt residue (for which mechanical/abrasive treatment is most efficient), dish washing is about cleaning carbohydrates (starch/sugar), lipids (oil, grease) and protein from the dishes. 

* Little House in the Big Woods (which although it is autobiographic fiction I think can be trusted on the matter of soap use) describes 1870s settlers in the US distinguishing between the holiday use of "store soap" and homemade "slimy, soft, dark brown soap that Grandma made and kept in a big jar to use for common every day" (probably produced from wood ash and animal fat - there's also a description of using wood ash for alkaline treatment of corn/maize). But soap is mentioned only for toilet use, not for dishwashing. 

Thus bases do help tremendously with dish washing. Two alkaline substances that have been around for very long time are 

Soaps are the salts of fatty acids. They are produced by hydrolyzing fat in alkaline (NaOH or KOH) solution, e.g. lye from ash. For cleaning purposes, sodium (Na) and potassium (K) soaps are used. Being a salt of a strong base (KOH, NaOH) and a weak acid, they still react basic, so for dish washing they also have the property of inducing hydrolysis of protein in addition to being emulsifier for lipids. Others have already given citations of ancient (Mesopotamia, Egypt etc.) knowledge of soap. Let me add that until sodium carbonate became a cheap industrial product, soap was a luxury article rather than a commodity (Ullmann's encyclopedia of industrial chemistry on Soap). From that I'd guess that the every-day dish washing was not done with anything so fancy*. Also, not so ancient history from middle Europe (great-grandma's time, anecdata): Cast iron pans were wiped, but removing grease/fat was not even intended. If they were washed to remove grease, they were greased again immediately after to prevent rusting. This meant a taste to everything that we'd nowaday refuse as rancid but which was normal in former times (compare haut-goût). Again, burnt residue was and still is best removed with mechanical means: abrasives such as sand or steel wool. Wooden plates were rinsed but also probably not washed to be totally grease-free. (Other cultures use one-way articles like banana leaves). In general, there was more cooking (and in general more soup/stew/porridge types of food) and less frying. And cooking pots are comparably easy to clean without (much) detergent if you start immediately or let them soak. Hard on the hands So alkaline substances help removing lipids and proteins. But in that they do not distinguish between the lipids that protect our skin and the lipids that should be washed away, nor between the food residue proteins that should be hydrolyzed and the protein of our skin. Which is why they are "hard on the hands". Modern dishwashing machine detergents do use this (possibly also enzyme-based degradation/digestion of proteins). As liquids for manual dishwashing are supposed to be in contact with exposed skin, they are neutral to slightly acidic. To achieve this, instead of soaps other tensids are used (e.g. organosulfates). This leaves the emulsifying properties, but does not help with the proteins. Instead, more mechanical action (scrubbing) plus soaking as needed are employed. Emulsifying (surfactant) properties means they still remove the lipids from your skin (excess lipids are added to toilet soaps to leave some lipid on your skin, but for dishwashing this would leave a lipid film also on the dishes). 

A nice timeline appears in Max I. Dimont's survey, Jews, God and History (Simon & Shuster 1962). Rather than using the order that you set out in your questions, I will answer chronologically according to Dimont's timeline. Note that historians disagree as to who and how the ideas of Judaism developed, and there might be some quibbling about the timeline, but I think Dimont's timeline is useful as a starting point. I do note that Orthodox religious sources have constructed timelines somewhat different from Dimont which are based on Biblical sources rather than the historical proofs Dimont relies upon. For interesting timelines based on Biblical narratives, see the Art Scroll Stone Edition Tanakh. Abraham Judaism begins with Abraham, according to Scripture, as he was the purported first believer in a single God and Creator. Dimont places Abraham within the period of the Babylonian Empire (Chaldean) founded by Hammurabi, 2000-1200 BCE (Before Common Era -- Jewish abbreviation in lieu of "BC"). This answers your points #5 and #6. Moses With Moses comes the giving of the Torah which establishes for the first time a comprehensive life guide and legal code. Dimont places this at 1200-1100 BCE. Dimont notes that while Sumerian and the Code of Hammurabi predated the Torah, they "lacked the passion" of the Torah and lacked its "democratic spirit," permitting favoritism for some rather than equal justice for all segments of the community. Dimont at p 43. With the Mosaic law came its distinct lifestyle requirements. Hence, this answers your point #1. Completion of the Written Torah (i.e. Genesis thru Deuteronomy) Citing the works of Biblical critics of the 1950s, which suggested that the Five books of the Torah were actually the blended result of four different narratives, based on certain linguistic changes in the text, such as the Names used for God. (Religious Jeweish scholars have other explanations for these variations, finding them to have significant meaning not expressly stated.) Based on these sources, Dimont dates the completion of the Written Torah at about 450 BCE, answering your point #2. Dimont at p 40. Completion of Tanakh The remainder of the Hebrew Scriptures, referred to in Judaism as the Tanakh -- an acronym that stands for the three groupings of its contents -- the Torah, the Navi (books of prophets) and Ketuvim (other writings, such as Ruth and Ecclesastes). Babylonian Exile, Return and the Men of the Great Assembly Dimont dates the destruction of the First Temple and the first exile of the Jewish people at between 600-500 BCE and their return to Israel under the leadership of Ezra the Scribe at 458 BCE. Donin at 69. Shortly after the return, the minor prophets who had survived the brief exile, Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai and Zechariah, as well as Mordechai -- a key figure from the Book of Esther -- were reported to have taken part in an organization known as the Men of the Great Assembly, or Anshei Knesset Gedollah. According to the Jerusalem Talmudm, Megillah 70d, and the Midrash in Ruth Rabba ii, 4, the Anshei Knesset Gedolah consisted of 85 elders, including 30 prophets. This group of leaders were responsible for the writing and/or preservation of numerous books of the Bible, in particular the books of the prophets and writings including Chronicles, and it appears that the Tanakh's writings end with them. While there are reasons to doubt that rabbis as late as the Third Century CE were open to further expanding Tanakh with books written after the Men of the Great Assembly, such as Sirach (aka Ecclesiasticus), no such books entered the Jewish canon. This is your answer to point 3. The Obligation to Study Torah The obligation of Jewish males to study Torah was long discussed in Rabbinic sources dating back 200 years before Jesus, and those rabbis found Biblical sources to support their position. In Mishna Avot, chapter 1, the head of the Sanhedrin, Joshua ben Perahya (2nd Century BCE) advised all men to find a teacher from which to learn Torah and to review those teachings with a friend. The famous rabbi, Hillel the Elder (1st Century BCE) is quoted in the second chapter of Mishna Avot as saying that one should set aside a time for daily Torah study and not say that he will study when he has time, because if he does so, he will never have free time. His contemporary, Shammai, is quoted in the first chapter of Avot as saying "make the study of Torah a fixed practice." Whether Torah study should be full-time for young men, or rather mixed with work and study during the same day, has been a matter of debate within Judaism for 2000 years. In the first century CE the Talmud (Brachot 35b), Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Ishmael took opposite positions. Rabbi Shimon condemned those who worked for a living and also studied Torah, believing that all should have devoted themselves to daily Torah learning as he had. Each cited proof from Biblical sources. A good discussion of this debate is cited here. It could be aruged, therefore that the obligation for daily Torah study is rooted in Biblical law or, alternatively, it was a requirement of the rabbis. Given the latter, I would place this obligation as having occurred no later than 200 BCE. A caveat must be made. For centuries there was a tradition of learning the Written Torah, and other Mosaic Laws not written in the Torah but transmitted by Moses to the Elders and passed down over centuries (the "Oral Torah"), that relied on memorization. Part of this was practical -- this was well before the printing press. Also, the decision to memorize Torah (used broadly in this context) was especially important given the possibility that a military defeat could result in complete destruction of written materials. So the question remains whether the average Jewish was taught to read. Scholars disagree. A high rate of literacy is implied in the NT: There, Jesus often rebutted his critics by saying "Have you not read..." implying that he and all of his followers, at least, were literate. See, e.g. Matthew 12:3. Jesus’ parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:6-7) implied literacy in the normal course of business in the Jewish society. This is also borne out in some archeological finds dating to the 12th century BCE where Israelite inscriptions are found on pottery and artifacts showing literacy was not exclusive to the elite. Aaron Demsky and Moshe Kochavi, “An Alphabet from the Days of the Judges,” Biblical Archaeological Review, Sept.-Oct. 1978, 23-25. Secular scholars who have tried to determine the levels of literacy in ancient Palestine do not refer to either the Gospels or rabbinic evidence that Jews were, mostly, literate. Israeli historian M. Bar-Ilan asserts that Jewish literacy ratein Roman-occupied Palestine was only 3% overall. Bar-Ilan, M., and lower than that of Romans (who, he says, had a 5% literacy rate). Illiteracy in the Land of Israel in the First Centuries CE. But in footnote 29 of his study, Bar-Ilan concedes that the Jewish literay rate might have been as high as 20 percent if he had excluded young children, women and farmers in far-off villages. And his number relies on a restrictive definition of "literacy" as meaning the ability to read a Torah scroll. Martin Jaffee, in his book, Torah in the Mouth: Writing and Oral Tradition in Palestinian Judaism argues in a footnote that a majority of craftsmen would have been literate on a functional level for their work. See also C. Herzner, in her book, Jewish Literacy in Ancient Palestine (takes the position that Jewish males in the Roman occupation had limited literacy -- a knowledge of Hebrew letters and an ability to sign their name, but most lacked the capability to fully read and understand a Torah scroll). The ability to be literate was dependent upon having money to afford a tutor. Rabbi Akiba began life as a pauper who cut wood for a living. He was illiterate until he was 40. Then, his wife, who had been born of wealth (but was disowned by her father when she married the pauper), could read and sold her hair and took jobs to send her husband to schools to learn to read and to learn Torah. Within 20 years he became one of the most preeminent scholars in Jewish history. That is my answer to point #4. 

(shared letters highlighted in bold) Since they likely shared the same formula as an opening, the newer inscription can be used together with the older stele to supply the end of Mesha's father's name (assuming it too was written by Mesha); putting them together gives his name as kmšyt. This reading is accepted by Douglas Green, "I Undertook Great Works": The Ideology of Domestic Achievements in West Semitic Royal Inscriptions p. 99 and Shmuel Ahituv, Collected Inscriptions from Israel and Transjordan Kingdoms from First Temple Times p. 362 (Hebrew) p. 362, as well as in K. C. Hanson's website here. 

Recorded history begins in the late fourth millenium with the invention of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt. At the time, kings already existed. So "the first king ever" is from far back in prehistory. There are no records from whenever that was, and so it's impossible to know exactly what happened. In the particular case of the Near East, kings were often considered gods, sons of gods, or became gods after they died. Just one example (from the Sumerian king list): 

Of course, a historian would probably consider this account mythological, and not representative of what actually happened. Other theories (a famous example is that of the social contract) are advanced in philosophy, but are not exactly in the realm of history. A more practical question is how kingship started in a particular society. For example, if you were interested in how the monarchy started in ancient Israel, you could read about Saul, the first king. If you were interested in how the Roman Kingdom became the Roman Republic and then became the Roman Empire, you could read about how each regime changed. All of these beginnings happened after kings had long existed, and the societies involved in the changes would have been well aware of kings from other nations; there is no documentation for "the first monarch ever." 

The direct motivation of Nebuchadnezzar in sparing King Jeconiah is not known. However, we can discern his motivation from subsequent events that suggest that keeping an heir of David alive, but under the thumb of the Babylonian king would make it easier to manage the large number of Jews in exile in Babylon. In or about the year 597 BCE, Jeconiah, the young king of the defeated kingdom of Judah, joins the first wave of Jewish deportees to Babylonia. II Kings 25:12. There, he and his family were cared for by King Nebuchadnezzar. James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 308. In Babylon, Jeconiah became the first exilarch (aka the Raish Galusa) (my transliterations follow ashkenaz practice; you will also find this term spelled Raish Galuta) -- a position of power over the Jewish people in exile that was held only by direct descendants of King David. Among the exilarchs were Judah the Prince, who was the editor of the Mishna and one of the greatest Torah scholars in Jewish history. The position of exilarch with Davidic geneology continued into the 11th century. One of the last exilarchs was Rav Sherira Gaon (ca 900-1000 CE), the author of the history of the Oral Law in Judaism, the Igerres Rav Sherira Gaon, and one of the last leaders of the ancient yeshiva in Pumpedisa, Babylon (believed to have been a neighborhood in what is now Baghdad). Through the position of exilarch, and by granting wealth and privilege to the exilarch, the Babylonians maintained effective control of their Jewish population in exile. Igerres Rav Sherira Gaon, Ch. 9 (Rav Sherira, at p. 113, states that the underwriting of the office continued until the 8th or 9th Century CE). An argument could be made that the existence of the institution also inhibited the efforts of Ezra, Nehemiah and Zechariah to repopulate Israel when Babylon agreed to make that possible 70 years after the 1st Temple's destruction.
