The reason why mac authentication does not work very well (in my experience), is because if I were the attacker, I would first send a deauthentication packet to the client whos mac I wanted to spoof, and I'd use a different spoofed mac to do so. Than the router can't tell the difference. However, as long as you are using WPA or WPA2, and have a strong passphrase, it'd be extreemely difficult for an attacker to crack your key, preventing a dchp lease from ever happening. A radius server does work with mobile devices and is the best way to secure a wifi network, when used with wpa2. It provides a dual authentication method with a certificate, I believe. 

There a a few questions related to using DFSR and Shadow Copies together, but none that indicates if Shadow Copies replicate or not. Meaning, if I have a a pair of DFS replicas with Shadow Copies on Server-A, can I revert that file to a previous version on Server-B? If so, will that reversion be replicated back to Server-A? I suspect not- that VSS is a local NTFS feature and outside the scope of replication, but I cannot verify that myself at the moment. 

Now at least I know that the traffic is being forwarded, which is a start. So I thought maybe I need to add a postrouting rule so that the traffic knows where to be sent back to 

(OUTIP means outgoing IP address, or venet0:1's address. VPN traffic is routed through venet0:0 to venet0:1) Next I set up a netcat listener: nc -l 0.0.0.0 -p 15555 And used this site to test the connection, which finally showed some progress: 

As suggested, the PROPER way would be to change the name back temporarily, run the STSADM tools and change the name to the desired one. The reason the name change prevents the instance from starting is that there are several places in the registry that refer to the location of the Central Admin and Content Databases. Specifically, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Web Server Extensions\14.0\Secure\ConfigDB, allthough there are others. If you search for the old name with a backslash and the word sharepoint(server\sharepoint), you should find them. STSADM can't make changes to the Config DB unless those references are right. Between those two things, you sholud be able to get it running with re-installing. 

Edit: Okay I will try to make this more clear. What I am trying to achieve is simply a port forward, through my OpenVZ hosted openvpn server, to a service running on a client. There are a few different services I'd like to forward, like a web server, or a bittorent client. For the sake of argument, let's say I just want to establish a functional netcat connection with this topology: internet --->[-->server(1.2.3.4:15555)]-nat-/->openvpn-server(10.8.0.1)--\ -> client running a webserver (10.8.0.6:15555) or .... (inet) --->|(public ip)-nat-through-openvpn-server--|->to-client-\ 10.8.0.6(destination) Where inet represents any host on the internet, 1.2.3.4 represents my server's public IP, and 10.8.0.6 represents the ovpn client that will be hosting the server, which I'd like reachable from behind the VPN, at the address/port 1.2.3.4:15555 Here is my ifconfig: 

With the described configuration, I have a SQL Agent Job that includes a Powershell step. That step throws an error when it gets to the line $app = start-process -passthru $program $program_args saying - "The error information returned by PowerShell is: 'The term 'start-process' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. '. Process Exit Code -1. The step failed." The lines preceding this seem to work ok. I suspect that the Powershell host that is running the script is crippled regarding that function but I am not able to verify this anywhere. 

That also works, although I would prefer to not have the destination port (9001) open to the world, but I could not get it to work otherwise. What I cannot get to work at all is forwarding traffic destined to the server's public IP ($EXT_IP in the example above) on a certain port to one of the VPN clients. I have tried doing this a few different ways. (I am also wondering if the point-to-point topology is complicating this?) I tried using rules such as described in another thread: 

The world doesn't run exclusively on ethernet(at least historically). The IP layer is independant of the hardware layer beneath it. PPP nodes don't have Mac addresses. Neither do arcnet, token ring, fddi, hppi. Those other standards may not be as relevent today, but ethernet may be replaced with other technologies in the future and it would be transparent to the IP layer. There's a longer discussion about how we keep inventing new hardware protocols and calling them ethernet, but I digress... 

I got the same result. I am so frusterated by how many hours I've spent trying to forward one dang port to a client. I would seriously appreciate some help! 

So I'd like for hosts on the internet to be able to reach a netcat listener (or webserver) at the server's public IP address, NAT'd through the openvpn server, to an openvpn client. I asked this question last night and deleted it because I thought I had figured out the answer, but it turns out I had not.. If this appears to be a duplicate question than I apologize. I have searched and have attempted to follow recommendations found in other threads on this topic.The situtation is that I have an Ubuntu Minimal vps. It is an OpenVZ container. It is primarily being used as a openvpn server. The network topology is p2p. I am trying to forward a port to a client (say 10.8.0.6, p2p 10.8.0.5) through the server's public IP (example 1.2.3.4) so that a certain service (let's say apache) is reachable from the VPN address 1.2.3.4. I know that because the server is an OpenVZ container, certain iptables workarounds need to be used, like for openvpn: 

I have two disks from an old server that I believe were a mirrored set. I placed them in a new server and tried to do a zpool import but nothing was found. Does that mean the data that was on them previously is lost or is there some way to reconstitute the pool? 

I have a Dell NX3000- which is a Windows Server 2008 based unit. It has an additional cabinet full of drives attached, as well. I have spare licenses for Windows Server 2012 Standard that could be applied to this unit to turn it into a smb 3.0 server. Obviously, this is not a supported configuration from Dell but are there any known issues on this hardware series that would prevent this?
