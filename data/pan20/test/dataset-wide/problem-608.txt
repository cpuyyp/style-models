I use a Park Tool device to check for stretch on my derailleured bikes - can the same tool be usefully deployed on a 1/8" 'track' chain, does anyone know? If not, how then to check for wear? 

Q: You generally see the top tube on steel bikes being parallel to the ground, whereas on a lot of carbon bikes it's angled. Why is that? A: It is because most steel bikes you see are old, designed and built in an age before the sloping top-tube was conceived (for Giant bicycles by Mick Burrows in the mid-90's I believe). So aside from recent artisan-built steel, most steel bikes will have horizontal top-tubes (parallel to the ground). By contrast, most carbon bikes were made as jm2 above has stated, with saving money on mould-making a key consideration, hence the slope. Interestingly, many custom-made steel bikes are now made sloping as well, because because its seen as a more modern look. Yet perversely some of the poshest new carbon frames (eg some Legend, Parlee and BMC frames) are now made with horizontal, or near-horizontal top tubes, because their customers want a more 'traditional' look. What goes around comes around. 

Spokes usually break from fatigue. Hitting things hard might dent the rim, or cause a spoke that is about to break from fatigue to fail, but it won't in itself fatigue rims. If your a heavy guy and the wheels are light, that might cause the spokes to fail early. Otherwise the chances are that the wheel just wasn't built very well. After all most cheap bike never actually go very far, so that fatigue life might not be the most pressing issue for the manufacturer. Once one spoke in a wheel has broken from fatigue, the rest will follow shortly. If the rim is not very worn and has no obvious dents, you may be able to get the wheel rebuilt by a good bike shop. Or you could by The Bicycle Wheel book by Jobst Brandt and it yourself. 

The benefit of a disc wheel is that you can ride faster than with a spoked wheel, on flat and rolling roads and at steady speeds. Once hills (gravity and lower speeds) or changes of pace, come into the mix the case for spoked wheels becomes stronger. 

To reduce your speed significantly while on dry roads, I recommend front brake first and hardest, because the front wheel will have most grip. If you only want to lose a little speed (but more than soft-pedalling), and gently at that, e.g. in a group riding situation to prevent others running into the back of you, then rear-brake only. On wet roads or loose surfaces you must avoid locking the front-wheel, so brake evenly and simultaneously front and rear. You have a chance of controlling a rear-wheel that is locked and skidding; that control is unlikely to extend to a locked and skidding front wheel. If it is icy and extremely slippery, consider rear-brake only and don't go too fast to begin with! 

Is there a reference/source/method for definitively determining the width of a bicycle tire without actually having it in hand? I ride a 2009 Jamis Aurora which came stock with 32 mm Vittoria Randonneurs. I wore the rear tire through, so I did some research on new tires and the 35 mm Schwalbe Marathon Mondial sounded like it fit my needs. Googling around forums, I gathered that it would be fine to put a 35 mm tire on the Aurora. This turned out to be not true -- it seized up against the frame right away. Interestingly, the contact was actually on the chain stay, not the seat stay. I'm a little bummed out by that, but I put the Mondial on the front (which fit fine) and threw the (formerly front tire) Vittoria Randonneur on the rear. Having now riden on the the Mondial, it makes huge difference: it feels way nicer than the Randonneurs. I want to know what I can replace my remaining Randonneur with, but am concerned about it seizing up? For the record my rim width is 20 mm. On a side note, doesn't it seems odd that a 'Touring' frame cannot support a 35mm tire? 

It sounds like an unpleasant road to ride on, I'm sure you would use a different route if one was available. If you can feel the slipstream, to the extent that it moves your bike around, things are passing to close. Paradoxically you may find that by riding further from the curb, passing vehicles will leave you more room. People tend to leave as much room between themselves and you as you give yourself between you and the curb. More importantly if you ride hard against the curb, you are out of the area that drivers are paying attentions to, you become part of the background, invisible, cars will pass without having to move over, the car behind them wont see you, or notice the car in front move to pass you and so on. All this may sound odd, its fairly mainstream Vehiclular Cycling, . If you are in the UK there's an excellent book Cyclecraft 

Recently there have been an increase in the number of fixed gear bikes in my (U.S.) city. Increasingly they tend to have one or zero brake levers, justified by their ability to stop with pedal power alone. Even more recently, I've noticed even larger numbers of single speed (non-fixed gear) bikes --- outnumbering the fixed gear bikes. And they often have only a single brake lever (for simplicity or fashion?). I understand the justification for having only a single brake on the fixed gear bikes because their braking redundancy lies within the drivetrain. I do not understand why this is acceptable on single speed bikes. Is there something I am missing or is that indeed ridiculously dangerous? Are manufacturers allowed to sell bicycles with non-redundant brakes? Is this regulated in the U.S. or anywhere else? This seems like a recipe for disaster (having experienced brake failure on my bike). 

Its like balancing a broom on you hand, you steer to move the wheels under you. Bike manufacturers help by designing the steering geometry so that the bike will stay upright on its own, if you don't mess with it. The gyroscopic forces help but are not essential. 

For protection from slow speed falls and stumbles in winter football (soccer) goalkeepers kit is cheap, warm and has protection for knees, hips and elbows. Its very popular for cycle speedway racing. 

Its a Chain tool, the long bit should screw into the back (bottom side in the pic) of the other bit to provide a handle. You can then put an hex key into the twisty bit at the right hand end.
