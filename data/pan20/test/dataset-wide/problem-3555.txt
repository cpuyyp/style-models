Maybe. I am not sure what you mean by "dynamic stretching" but if you mean bouncing while stretching in any form, then don't do it. You muscles tendons and ligaments have a range of stretch which you are trying to improve. That range has a limit. Beyond that limit, they don't stretch, they tear. The goal is to go to or near that limit for just 30 seconds or so, then rest and let your body adapt during which time it will increase its flexibility. You know where that limit is because you can feel that tension increase as you approach it. When you can't stretch any further, you're at it. Going beyond this point by bouncing is just a form of throwing your body in a direction which forces the attached muscles tendons and ligaments to extend past that point. Now they're tearing. That's possibly what you're feeling and why. The response to stretching - increased flexibility - is invoked by staying merely near the limit of your current stretching range for 30-45 seconds. That's it. You do not have to exceed it, you gain no benefit from exceeding it, and you risk micro-injury and the cumulative effects of such injury by exceeding it. You have to be consistent and work hard for many things in fitness. Flexibility isn't one of those things. To get flexible, you just have to be consistent. Every day, for 30-60 seconds max, stretch until you start to feel a slight clearly non-painful tension that is nevertheless more than you feel otherwise, stay there for 45 seconds or so and that's it, you're done. Changes will happen with all possible speed following that simple and easy regime. HTH 

If you mean- what is the best easily observable indicator of rate of calorie burning during exercise, then in general for any given exercise the harder your heart and lungs are working, the more calories you are burning. With calorie burning though, you're better off keeping your heart down so you can sustain the activity for a longer time. If yo're doing something and your heart rate is 80%, 90%, 100% max, and you're burning 20+ calories a minute then by definition you're doing high intensity exercise, possibly anerobically, and you won't be burning 20 cals a minute for long because you'll have to quit. To burn the most calories, it's more important to exercise at a rate you can sustain for a longer time. 

For anyone who thinks over-training is not an issue, and is telling other people the same, please educate yourself before posting. Overtraining is not only real, but also dangerous. No responsible person should be insinuating to anyone that it does not apply, both to ordinary and elite athletes. Overtraining is not only a real, acknowledged phenomena, it has been the subject of intense study spanning decades at institutions like the NIH and all accredited universities. There is no controversy amongst academic researchers, doctors and exercise PhDs. that overtraining is very real. In the end, it pays to consider your sources with respect exercise advice. You can listen to the hit and run postings of anonymous internet posters and end up hurting yourself, possibly permanently, or you can listen to what people whose entire professional lives have been dedicated to studying exercise are telling you. Here are some links to what is the tiny tip of the iceberg of current research on overtraining being conducted by doctors and PhDs. Such research extends back at least 40 years and more Overtraining Syndrome From Mark Jenkins, MD Rice University: $URL$ Overtraining: Undermining Success?

The exact reason you require more time for recovery as you get stronger is easy to see if you consider the difference between an untrained man with a 12 inch pipe-stem for an arm and a well-developed bodybuilder. Mr. Pipestem, when he does curls, is forcing a small and weak muscle to work very hard. Mr. Huge if he does the same thing is causing a huge muscle to work very hard. For Mr. Pipestem, the cost to his recovery system is small, to Mr Huge the curls represent a bigger cost to his recovery system. You're ability to recover from exercise might go up 50 or even 80% from your untrained baseline if you become very fit. But youre ability to generate that cost may double or even triple as you get stronger. Your ability to generate bigger stressors to your body by improving the strength of your muscles outstrips your ability to improve your ability to recover. That's the issue in a nutshell. If you're big and strong and work out very hard, you've really imposed a very large burden on your underlying metabolic system which gates your recovery rate. That's a bigger burden than you did when you were not so strong, relative to that same recovery rate. HTH. 

Think about what five minutes could possibly yield in conditioning. Obviously you have to issue a challenge to your heart and lungs walking isn't going to help you. Suppose you did the opposite of walking. Suppose you did wind sprints for five minutes, that is, you ran 40 meters in one direction as fast as you can- a full out sprint every step of the way, then immediately turned around and did it again in the opposite direction. What you would find is you couldn't do it for five minutes. In fact, no-one can because as hard as you can exercise is shorthand for anaerobic and no one's body can process the waste products of anaerobic exercise fast enough to keep the body working anaerobically for five minutes. The result is, you stop and your heart and lungs are working as hard as they can. So now you have a formula for working out hard in five minutes. No doubt your conditioning will improve over what it is now, the thing is, it's not clear it would improve as much as if you were able to dedicate 20 minutes or hard exercise interspersed with lower intensity exercise. 20 minutes 3 times a week is the minimum of time usually cited as needed for progressive improvement of your heart and lung capacity and efficiency. Under that assumption, repeated runs at achieving the impossible- a full 5 minutes of continuous wind sprints- would not be as effective for conditioning. That said, I am not aware of any researchers who have investigated the effects of a such specific and limited regime. You can get in a completely challenging (to say the least) workout in five minutes. Whether it's a workout that will lead to progressively increased fitness and if so, what that fitness might yield in terms of capacity and endurance outside of doing wind sprints, I am not sure. I am not advising you to do this (consult your doctor), I am merely pointing out that 5 minutes is actually plenty of time to give your heart and lungs a real workout. Something to think about. 

Man I am going to tell you not to do this. Gymnastic exercises are done on secure equipment which is well maintained and practice is performed with spotters - for good and obvious reasons. If you're really not going to be doing any double dislocates but essentially just hanging from it and lifting your body weight, then you want to consult someone who understands the strength of materials under stress- an engineer. Not someone here who may only know HOW to use equipment, but not make it. Maybe you can buy equipment specifically made for this purpose, but you still have to worry about maintenance and attaching it properly. I am not saying it's rocket-science, I am saying it's high stakes for you if things go wrong and you owe it to yourself to get definitive answers to this question from truly qualified sources. Best of luck. 

Ed Corney didn't get into bodybuilding until he was 33 (cf. interview with Ed Corney) and did very well for himself winning the Mr. Universe and being a Mr. Olympia contender. You can see a YouTube video of him at various ages here: Ed Corney Posing. More to the point, muscle strength (and size) begins to decrease in adult men and women largely as a result of simple disuse. There is nothing about being in your twenties or even thirties which will inhibit your ultimate potential as a bodybuilder. In fact, unless you actualize 100% of your potential you will probably always be able to get bigger and stronger, even into your 50s and 60s and beyond if you haven't used drugs as an ergonomic aid. The reason for this is that muscular hypertrophy in response to bouts of intense exercise - what we call getting bigger- is an inherited response built into muscles. That response doesn't cease to "work" at any particular age just the way your skin's response to sun (getting darker) never ceases to work. I took my grandmother into the gym at age 72, had her perform 5 sets total for her entire body, each to failure. I kept careful records of weights and time-working and each time we returned to the gym, she was measurably stronger in weights or reps or both. We kept this up for months until I moved away and there didn't seem to be any slow down in her progress. How quickly you recover from high intensity exercise may decrease with advanced age as may how much exercise you can tolerate. Those may ultimately be the limiting factors in upwards gains of strength. But certainly in your 20s you have absolutely nothing to worry about. One caveat is- if you reach a high level of strength through drugs, you won't be able to sustain it after you go off those drugs. So you will reach an artifical high quickly, then go down no matter how you train. In this case only, proper training will lead to a decrease in strength. 

The flab on your stomach is just a part of the flab which is all over your body. The people who are telling you you can't target it specifically are right; you have to just lose fat and your body will remove it from all over your body. So you should reconceputalize your goal as just "losing weight". note that everyone has an inherited pattern of fat distribution. That means that when you gain weight, the fat tends to go some places more than others. By the same token, when you lose weight, the fat loss will come off in the same way it went on. If you tend to put fat around your stomach when you gain weight, then you'll tend to lose fat from your stomach first when you lose weight. Losing weight is a game of numbers and you need to know them and track them in order to succeed. Here are the numbers you need: 1) Your resting metabolic rate. This is how many calories your body needs in a day to just exist- breath, sit upright and keep yourself alive without losing or gaining weight. There are ways to guess pretty accurately and there are ways to find out with certainity that involve specialized equipment. This is something for you to look into- trust *.gov and *.edu sites for accurate information; there's a lot of quackery out there. 2)The total calories in the food you did in fact eat during each day, every day. You have to track these scrupulously every day. You need a calorie counter which lists the actual foods you ate and you need an oz or gm scale so you can know for a fact how much of each thing you ate. 3) An equally accurate record of your calories expenditure over the day. There are three parts to this. One is your RMR as discussed before. That is the baseline number of calories you're guaranteed to have spent even if you're sick in bed. The second part is the calories above your RMR you spent just tooling around, working and living life. This excludes exercise. You can accurately guesstimate these numbers by characterizing your daily life as sedentary (office job where you sit), mildly active (sitting for most of the day but with periods of walking or standing) or very active (being a nurse, say). Go online and find a trustworty site which takes your weight and height and your activity level and gives you back a percentage of your RMR (in calories) that your daily life requires over and above your RMR. There's of course an app for this too. The third part of the calorie calculation is the calories you spent deliberately exercising. Again there are .gov tables and tables from various .edu sites which have been assembled using thousands of test subjects over decades and you should find and use those tables. They are accurate. Be careful with apps not all of which may not give accurate information. It is very important that you're numbers are accurate. Your RMR is generally fixed and unchanging. The calories and exercise are numbers that vary and you have to track them both every day. You should write them down as you eat them in and exercise them off. Now that you know what numbers you need to track on, here's what you should do with them. You should make sure that you're consuming 500 fewer calories than you're using each day. That is a high goal to achieve, but it is effective and realistic. It will result in the loss of 1 lb. (2.2 kg.) per week (1 lb of fat = 3500 calories; 7 days of the week x 500 calories a day = 3500 calories). At that rate it's unlikely you will even have to diet 20 weeks. So starting with your RMR, add the calories from your dialy life and the calories from exercise. That is your daily caloric expenditure. Now try to adjust your calories from food, so you're 500 calories short of what you expended. This means getting to know how many calories are in any serving of food that passes your lips. That means weighing or measuring the food, looking up the calories and writing it down. Pretty soon you'll be an expert in calorie count for the foods you regularly eat. You have to do this. It also means truly knowing how many calories each exercise you do burns per minute. Some burn more than others but you can't do them for long- i.e. weightlifting. You only count the minutes you are actually exercising, not the time you spend between sets or standing and breathing hard or anything else. Mild aeorbics doesn't burn as many as weightlifting as a rule, but is better for losing weight because you can do it for longer than an anerobic exercise like weightlifting. It just amounts to more calories burnt! You have to be a little OCD about counting calories and exercise records and you also have to be realistic in your goals. In the beginning, really the first week or so, just counting calories and accurately tracking exercise without trying to limit your food intake is quite enough discipline to have to adjust to. The second week, try limiting your food so you come in 250 calories under what you calculated you used. You'll feel real hunger there and you have to teach yourself to cope with that real hunger. I would say a couple of weeks of being successful at that is a real milestone many people fail. Now you're aware of how long you have to exercise to burn off a banana or a piece of toast and you're looking at those foods differently, thinking things like "if I eat this, then it means another 15 minutes of cardio, and that's a lot of work!". The third week you can step things up so you're realizing a deficit of 500 calories. Don't think this is easy- it's truly hard dieting, but not so hard it's undoable. The chief reason people fail is, well, they don't know to do any of the above, LOL but for those who DO do the above, the chief reason they fail is they get greedy and try to go on too hard a diet and because food supplies the energy needed for willpower, they run out of willpower! Really a 500 deficit is full gallop and will get you anywhere you need to go in excellent time. One other thing- exercising the area you want to lose fat from doesn't work. Specifically, exercising your abs to lose fat around them doesn't work. The energy your body needs to do exercise is not drawn from the fat stores around the muscle you're working. It's drawn from the energy (glucose) in your bloodstream as a result of your last meal OR it's drawn from adipose tissue evenly, from all over your body. You cannot induce your body to lose weight around your stomach by doing exercises for your stomach. Just lose weight, and the adipose which is covering your abs will shrink in size then, as a consequence, you'll then see the ab muscles clearly, muscles you always had, but were hidden under fat. Very best of luck to you!
