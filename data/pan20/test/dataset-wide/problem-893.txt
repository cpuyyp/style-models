Oh, yeah, she's clearly unstable from the moment we meet her. Even better, she chooses to be unstable. In her very first appearance, she calls on supernatural forces to remove all traces of compassion: 

Try asking the question this way: "How does this line affect the reader?" Taken in itself, it's a very disconcerting image: some kind of illusory freedom. The phrase "check out" hints at death, suggesting that your freedom is so compromised that not even death can release you. It's important to note that this in the context of "night man", a late-night hotel clerk. He cannot necessarily be trusted to be providing correct information, especially in the light of his confusing and ambiguous "we are programmed to receive". I'm not sure how the word "programmed" would have been received at the time the song was written, but today it alludes to a computer without free will. (I suspect it was that way at the time, too, but there might have been subtle differences since computers weren't ubiquitous.) It's very easy to think of this solely in terms of drug addiction, which includes by definition a loss of free will. That's certainly a valid understanding of it, though it still doesn't admit an image-by-image allegorical reading; some images resist that interpretation. So I'd say the best way to understand that line is to think of it in terms of the emotions it invokes in you, in whatever way you connect to it. That's why the band's seemingly contradictory statements about its "interpretation" are all simultaneously valid. Rather than telling you a coded story, it's creating a set of emotions that are common to many states of humanity. 

The word's origin is in mimicking the whinny of a horse, which is after all what the Houyhnhnms are. To my knowledge Swift never gave more specific pronunciation guides than that. There's probably no precise human equivalent, just as mung-mung, guau-guau, and woof-woof are all ways that humans try to reproduce the sound of a dog. My English professor rendered it as "whin-in-im", and I'm sure her colleagues had a whole host of variations. I think that any of them is more or less equally valid. English speakers do have some experience in that initial aspiration, at least those in places that haven't undergone the wine-whine merger. The extra h's in "Houyhnhnm" do imply more aspiration in the ns, but I think that's more important in the written than spoken form. Pronouncing it would be a bit like switching accents in the middle of a sentence, for an accent you don't really speak. With a natural language it would risk sounding pretentious. So, when called on, I mimick my old English prof, just because that's what gets the point across. I'd say that any other set of speakers pronouncing the word will end up in the vicinity of that, and mimic each other to reach a consensus, but that's neither more nor less right than any of their original pronunciations. 

These are all popular poems; many of them are still familiar. What they have in common is that they have very strong, straightforward meters, applied with significant rigor. Orwell's problem with them is that they're "sentimental", which is, uh, problematic. It's hard for me to untangle that from "popular". They are conceptually fairly simple, which contributes to their popularity. They're not as rich -- at least in Orwell's estimation -- as "real" poems. Orwell distinguishes poetry from "verse", by which he seems to mean Hallmark card doggerel. That exemplifies all of these features even more strongly: very straightforward and strong meters; easy, obvious, and repetitive rhymes; simple, strong emotional resonances. I find it interesting that he excepts poems before 1790. Shakespeare himself wrote some deliberately bad poetry, as in A Midsummer Night's Dream: 

I don't believe the Raven symbolizes death at all, but rather life, in grief of having to live after a loved one is dead. As Poe himself put it in his essay Philosophy of Composition: 

Which is to say, "There are certainly fools with too much money, and you're one of them". Silver, like gold, and unlike lead, represents money. 

"The boys of summer" are baseball players, but the other metaphors seem to refer more directly to the passage of summer itself (and taking the baseball players with it). He continues to love her. The line in isolation suggests devotion even after the fading of youth, but in context, the images point to a relationship that itself is over and he's having a hard time letting go. The "deadhead sticker on the Cadillac" is another of those supporting images. The owner was presumably a follower of the Dead in their youth, but is now driving an expensive car rather than a beat-up VW Microbus. They retain a little bit of their youthful exuberance after selling out... or perhaps it's mere pretension and a hanging on to a past that, like the boys of summer, have gone. 

"Sore" also means "deer". From "Sport on Dartmoor", 1895, reprinted in Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature, and Art: 

These are song lyrics, which may be exempted, but the text seems to illustrate the style. It's the standout from Cats for exactly the reasons "good bad poetry" is so popular: very strong emotions and straightforward imagery. 

He knows, however, he can't have her, and should move on. That's the "little voice inside [his] head". The key refrain is 

Well... who says they didn't? We see the play mostly from Hamlet's point of view. He has few allies, and deliberately pushes people away. For all we know, lots of other people were suspicious of the guy who started screaming when presented with a situation not unlike the circumstances of his rise to power. They just didn't do anything about it, at least not in Hamlet's field of view. Of course, if they were plotting something, they'd hardly tell Hamlet, would they? He's been acting nuts lately. There is much to be made of Gertrude's reaction. The play is ambiguous about her knowledge of the situation. I've seen it presented with everything from her being a complete patsy, to a woman making the best of a very precarious situation, to a co-conspirator in the murder. It will be hard for a live audience to look at her at the moment Claudius is yelling for the lights, but the actor should certainly be making choices at that instant about what she is learning. A film director, with better control over the audience's point of view, can help direct their attention to her choices. As for everybody else, there is one nice bit of text that helps guide how to play the rest of the court:
