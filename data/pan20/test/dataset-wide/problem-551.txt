I switched to mini-v brakes, then to cantis. The mini-v brakes worked well, but I had a few issues. Here's what I found. 

Continental makes a version of the Mountain King (Mountain King 2.2 Protection) with a higher TPI and their ProTection anti-puncture system. I would recommend spending the extra cash on the Mountain King's with this feature. Alternatively, you could pick up some Tuffy Liners to add a layer of protection to your existing tires. 

I would be wary. Can you do it? Yes. Will it affect the geometry and handling of the bike? Yes Is there a chance you will pedal strike more frequently? Yes The drop will reduce chainring clearance when doing log overs as well. One thing you may want to consider is getting wider 650b rims and going for 650b+ (aka 27.5+) tires as they will fit a lot of existing 29ers and will not alter your geometry significantly. Anything from a 650x2.8 to a 3.0 will be in about the same range of tire size as a 29er wheel/tire combination, but will have a wider / rounder tread profile. A wide rim will be needed, 35mm to 50mm rims are typically used for a 650b+/27.5+ setup. You'll need to check and be sure you have the frame clearance as well, but if you can fit 29x2.4 tires, you should be good using a smaller tire like the wtb trailblazer which is 27.5x2.8 and should work well with a lot of frames. 

Since you have friction shifters and an 8/9 speed derailleur, you should be able to pop a 9 speed cassette on the back and use the full range. You'll have to re-adjust your limit screws of course. Worst case, if that doesn't work, you may be able to remove one of the small cogs and space it out to use only 8 speeds. The font chainrings will also likely be fine, usually you can go up/down one size without issue for front chainrings. Since your front chainring is designed for 8-speed, it will probably work fine with a 9-speed chain. I regularly use a 9-speed chainring in front with an otherwise all 10-speed setup without issues. 

Yes, tires with a less knobby tread will be faster on pavement. You may also lose some efficiency due to your suspension fork as well. If you can lock out the suspension on your fork, then that would probably improve the ride quality as well. Do you need another bike? No, but other bikes may be better suited to city riding. If you don't plan on riding the mountain bike off road, you might consider another style of bike, however many people are totally happy using a mountain bike in the city as their primary bike. 

I definitely recommend this. Running lights will make you more readily visible as the light will penetrate the fog to an extent. Reflectors and high-viz clothing will be somewhat less effective during foggy conditions. Use caution riding in foggy conditions as drivers may not see you until they are very close. 

You could use ridewithgps to build your map. It allows you to drag waypoints off the main route and re-routes (can be used without auto routing as well if you prefer). You'll have to pay if you want to print from their site. However, you can print a cue sheet free or export the saved map in GPX or TCX format to print with another application or website that accepts these uploads. 

I've seen several different descriptors for disc brake pads: Metallic, Semi-Metallic, and Organic. What is the difference between these types of disc brake pads? 

What are good resources to use to find dirt roads, fire roads, gravel roads, or disused paved roads for planning a gravel grinder or ultracross style ride. Any particular atlases, online mapping resources, government departments to check? 

For Shimano gear If you are going all 9-speed, you're fine using most STI shifters with 9-speed mountain derailleurs. New 10 spd Dyna-Sys rear derailleurs won't work with 10 spd STI shifters if you're going Shimano. However, I've heard people have had success using a 9-speed Shimano Deore M592 Shadow Rear Derailleur with 10 speed STI shifters. See thread on MTBR for a bit more info on someone's successful setup with a Shimano 10 speed road/mountain setup $URL$ I don't think there are any issues if you're going for a SRAM road shifter / mountain derailleur combination if you're going 10 speed and using the XX mountain group which has the same pull ratio as the road groups. It appears that 9 speed mountain gear and some of the other 10 speed mountain group sets, have a slightly different pull ratio and don't play well with road shifters. 

I have a nice SP dynamo hub and an old Supernova E3 Triple dyanamo light. However, the dynamo light isn't very bright when I'm starting my ride, as my ride has a long hill at the very start, so I don't go very fast. Then it's a lot of stop and go riding for the rest of my commute with a few more small hills. The standlight kind of sucks until I've been riding on a straight stretch for a while. Looking forward, I would consider buying new gear to help, but I'm not sure what I need (other than just only using battery powered lighting). Basically, I want my bike to always have lights on while I'm riding through the winter months where I'm commuting both to and from work in the dark, and not loose lighting when I'm stopped or going slow on a climb (where I'm very venerable). Currently, I have to supplement having dynamo lighting with battery powered lights since the dynamo lights cut in and out due to my hilly commute with lots of stop and go urban riding. Does anyone make an inline power buffer for dynamo based lights to provide (a) Immediate on when you want to start riding and (b) Constant power while stopped? Or are there lights or other equipment that provide this feature (without forcing me to build my own circuit boards and such)
