Build yourself a healthy diet similar to what they used to eat in Mediterranean villages in the old days : before electricity, when the meat had to be eaten fresh there, so they used to eat less meat and more full of protein grains/ veggies. 

And see what happens. It should get better by then. And even if it doesn't, its not a big deal just focus on burning the remaining fat. 

(you can add bacon/turkey bacon to it if you want more taste). Chop the onions and mix the ingredients (do Not chop the spinach else the juice of the leaf will evaporate and ruin the taste). Now this has a good amount of protein and low calories and taste good. But, also notice the spinach, which in fact is the best food on earth probably, because it has a lot of uric acid which gets transformed into amino acids (protein) in the body, thus in fact you'll be having more protein than 29g. This is an energetic meal. 

Lean mass is thus the pure muscle mass without the fat. Men have more lean mass than women , because their body composition and physiology has more muscles, particularly in the upper body. Thus it makes the muscle's percentage higher than the one in women. To calculate your lean mass you need first to measure your body fat percentage. You can do this using machines (some are not very accurate) or using a caliper. The caliper is the fastest and cheapest tool you can have. Check out this video on how to use a caliper, and this link to enter your measured data and use the calculator to get your body fat percentage and lean mass. Remember two things: 

The 3 factors mentioned put you in a "good" state for running. PS: make sure you dry well after swimming before running specially if you live on the beach, night sea winds are fresh and if you didn't dry well you might get sore muscles the next day. 

Consider an example, a person X who's weight is say :90 kg. Then consider another person Y who's weight is also :90 kg. Both have same weight, BUT, X has more lean mass than Y. What does that mean? it means your bodyweight is a sum of different factors: 

I sometimes have a similar breakfast (without the protein powder) but what you have to do is to mix them overnight and put them in the fridge. This way the oat will get soaked by the milk and it will be smooth the next day and tastes really good! On a side note, you can add to the mixture banana and almonds too, it will be a perfect energetic and tasty meal. 

Until two summers ago where i got rid of 90% of my belly fat and now am back in shape. From my personal experience, fat loss is genetically defined, but as i am not a doctor i cannot claim this is a general rule. But however the scientific researches i mentioned approve what i am saying. 

"never lose" is an extremely wrong statement. The body is very flexible and adaptable. The fasting system you are following will reduce your metabolism because your body will be receiving less calories with very low frequency, so the body clock will regulates itself to hold on to the calories you eat and slows down the fat burn process. However this is only true during the period of fasting ,and as soon as you stop fasting and start eating again regular meal, your body will re-adapt to it and raise the metabolic speed. On a side note, Christian-wise, lent fasting is a sacrifice you make with a specific intention. In my personal opinion, you do not need to go extreme fasting during the lent period, and unless you have a specific reason to eat "this" few, you can make a sacrifice to stop one thing you like during the 40 days. For example, let's say, if you love eating potato chips, you can stop that for 40 days. You do not have to stop "eating" in general, and even more, fasting in Christianity is not mandatory, it is a personal sacrifice you do by choice. So, i'd suggest, just choose one or two things you like and do not eat of them during this period. This way, you stay healthy, can still work and do daily tasks, and do not harm yourself by extreme low calories and nutrients intake. 

Squatting not only tones and builds legs muscles, but it empowers ur core, helps you build 6 pack muscles and produce much more growth hormones and thus help u add muscle mass. Same for burpees, it is what i call "explosion" workout. Once you do it u will understand, you will get sore muscles even places where u never knew muscles existed. However, please do these two exercises step by step, with good posture because if you don't take care you might injure urself. (i injured my knees because i overdid burpees and i was kinda jumping diagonally not straight.. I got what is called Plica Syndrome and my doctor said i have to rest from leg exercises for 6 weeks. However if you do it properly you 'll see its probably the best bodyweight exericse for power, tone, fat burning and muscle mass increase). As for variations i highly recommend mark Lauren's book, it has around 111 bodyweight exercises variations with full routines for different levels (beginner,intermediate,...) 

b) 2 days cardio lift weight 2 days in a row then one day only cardio (30 to 40 minutes MAX). i recommend skip rope and biking c)CardioAcceleration It is a technique by Dr jim stoppani. Read more here i explained it on my page. This is very simple and efficient: do not rest between set, do 1 minute of any cardio you want. 

Which also means it is a very good calorie level (specially in the morning and post workout) , very low in fat and very high in protein. Note: 

But if you are in the good range of calories, Fat does not make you fat at all. It gives you a lot of energy (1g of fat yield 9kcal) and help regulate your hormones for growth and recovery. However, 99% of the fat you eat should be the good fat, ie the mono/poly unsaturated fat. while Saturated fat, you do need a bit , but if you eat too much your arteries get clogged with time. 

You might have what i think is called "irritable bowel syndrome" which means you get easily bloated and whatever you eat gets heavily fermented. In my case, when i cut down calories and eat "less quantities" for several days , this problem disappears. 

I know the information are probably not common (80 years old, 1feet 0 inch, 22 pounds), but what does it mean when you get a negative BMR and a negative Energy need? I did not try all possible cases where u might have a negative value (For negative, it is in general required: left side < right side where right side is ( 6.8 x age in year ) ) but if let's say a nutritionist is using this formula on a client and gets a negative result what do they do? 

Now, in details i will explain both phases. All the info i am about to give you are based on several familiar bodybuilding facts i have read and tried through years and personal experience ==> you do NOT have to follow it, but i can assure you this works and most bodybuilders do it BULK UP PHASE: a) Workout (40 minutes, 4 times a week. You don't need more) The concept in a nutshell is: lift heavy with rest in between sets. Lifting heavy will help you build power and mass, and resting in between sets will help you recover and recharge the glycogen store (energy) of the muscle to keep lifting. You should aim for heavy weights and low reps (between 8-12). Heavy weight will challenge you muscles, build the fibers and give you mass. However do not harm yourself, go gradually, start with weights you can lift without injuries and with time you will build resistance and strength and you will be able to lift more. Now as i said, working out is 20% of progress and food is 80%. So i discuss nutrition next. b) Nutrition for bulk up To add mass, you MUST eat a lot. Remember, when you bulk up you will add muscle mass AND a bit of fat (there is no way to not add some fat while bulking up). Now, you want to do what they call "clean bulk", means add maximum muscle mass with minimum fat. So you should Calculate your maintenance(BMR) calories, which is how much your body needs to survive at rest and add to it around 700 to max 800 calories (if you add more you will be adding more fat, but you can try if you want genetics play a big role too). So for example you are:
