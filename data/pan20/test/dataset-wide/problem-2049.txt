Assuming you have regular (weekly?) one-on-one meetings with your boss, that would be the appropriate time for a casual conversation about additional time off. It would be reasonable to ask when your accrual rate would change. You might want to tread lightly on some of the points, though. Indicating that you are burned out after 3 years might not be in your best interest. Some managers would be concerned about that, and might start to direct important and interesting projects away from you. That wouldn't be a good career move. While you could point out what you believe to be a US average for PTO, your boss is likely not in a position to do anything about that unless he is a C-level executive in the company. And he almost certainly already knows the US averages anyway. Pointing that out wouldn't provide any real benefit. As far as you "haven't been able to take a vacation", that's a bit problematic, too. Combined PTO typically covers all time off - illnesses and personal days as well as vacation time. You could have taken a vacation if you hadn't used up the days for other purposes. Certainly you know of co-workers who have taken vacations. When I worked at a company that had a Combined PTO policy, it was routine for people to come to work when they were ill, in order to preserve vacation days. I personally think Combined PTO is a foolish corporate policy, but we all have to deal with the benefits we are given, or go to a different company offering better benefits. So be a bit careful with how your frame your discussion with your boss. Remember that he may not be in any position to change corporate policy, so there may be very little he can do for you. You don't want to come across as a whiner. You might consider asking if the corporate policy allows for unpaid time off - and that way get your vacation time and avoid your burnout. 

Most likely there is something in your background or resume that would typically expect a higher salary than was being offered. Perhaps you are far older than the typical entry-level software developer, and the recruiter's experience tells him that few people in your age group have been willing to settle for that salary level. Perhaps you have experience or skill that would typically put you beyond the usual entry-level category. Perhaps the recruiter believes that most undergraduate interns expect to earn more when they leave intern status. No way to know for sure without asking the recruiter directly. 

You could attempt to bring it up, but I suspect most hiring managers wouldn't care much about potential offers you got that you didn't accept. They would likely feel that their "whole package" was better. Offers that you may have been able to get but turned down don't really compare with offers that you would actually like to accept. It's comparing apples to oranges. Stick with what you feel you are worth and the value you can bring to the company. Avoid discussing jobs that you didn't accept as evidence of what you feel you are worth. 

Some companies feel that any disruption is minimized by reducing the number of days when people know someone is leaving. Sometimes the individual doesn't want others to know for personal reasons. If you want to know why it happens in your company, you'll have to ask. 

The only valid argument to use is "I am the best person for this job." You need to decide what you think the role of the CEO should be in your new company. For many startups, funding, sales, and marketing are most important, not technical ability. But your mileage may vary. Express your vision for the company, how you plan to lead it there, and why you are uniquely qualified to be that leader. 

You will be gone in two months. Even if it's "quite difficult", you don't have to tolerate it for very long at all. 

No, it's not a good idea. You cannot really serve as a professional reference, since you haven't worked with him. You cannot serve as a positive personal reference, since you had conflicts with him personally. It doesn't sound like you would want to work with this person. Since you cannot give him a good reference, you should try to avoid giving any reference at all. 

It's hard to ask for written assurance that your "concerns will be taken care " without specifying those concerns in detail. No company will say "sure, we'll take care of all your concerns". And certainly no company that knows you are concerned about working lots of weekends/holidays (yet specifically mentions that working these will be required), is going to make such a promise. If you were on great terms with your employer and you knew that the company is always fair in these matters, it would be one thing. But the fact that they specifically mention weekends/holidays and the fact that you specifically mention your work-life balance, and are asking for written assurance regarding your concerns tells me that you don't trust them to do what you want them to do. You "have seen how miserable this can go". You have already worked for long stretches without time off and didn't like it. You already suspect a similar situation here. Time to politely decline and move on from this project. 

Yes. You are missing the fact that some companies hire people to be Linux Kernel Developers. Do a quick search on job boards or Google, and you'll find some. Perhaps in your part of the world, and with your background/experience. 

I can tell you from personal experience that a well-done blog can attract attention your way and even have recruiters and potential employers come looking for you. That said, a good blog won't make up for the lack of requisite skills. And a bad blog can turn a potential employer off. When I hire folks, I do an initial phone screen. If it goes well, I do a search to check out their online presence before I invite them in for an onsite interview. If I find a good blog attached to their name, I'm happy. If I find a bad blog, I'm not so happy. 

A large part of this depends on your locale, and the domain in which you want to work. In many parts of the world Certifications are rather important, but in my experience, in my field, far less so in the U.S. One way to approach this is to search job boards and see what kinds of certifications they are currently requiring in your locale, for the kinds of jobs you are seeking. When I tried that a few years back, I learned that generally speaking, US employers seeking Software Testers don't require certifications very much (if at all): $URL$ 

Since in your comments you indicate that you don't want more training, or help - that you just want to do the tasks that correspond to your (current) level of knowledge, I'll answer to that directly. You go to the director and say something like "You have given me some new tasks and I don't think I'm currently capable of performing them adequately. That is making me frustrated, and sometimes I don't feel as if I fit in here. I would prefer to work on only Junior-level tasks and not have to work on more Senior-level tasks." Before you discuss it, be aware that this will have some impact on you. You are basically saying that you aren't as good or capable as your director thinks you are. And that sort of statement has a way of sticking for a while. I'd rather suggest that you ask for training or mentoring instead, but you seem to have already ruled that out. So at least go into this discussion aware of the possible impact. 

Unfortunately, you let a bad precedent develop. Time to put an end to the "leave the pizza unattended and hope for the best" practice. 

No, you don't have to answer instantaneously. In fact, if a potential employer insisted on an answer to a question of this magnitude without allowing some time for thinking it over, I'd be very, very wary. It's very common to ask for a few days to think the offer over. (I always discuss things with my wife before making a job decision.) 

Certainly you can decide to go back on your word for any reason and attempt to negotiate a better offer. While it seems very unlikely to succeed, it doesn't sound like you care much anyway, so you have nothing to lose. (As an aside, you can blame them for being "borderline incompetent" but you were the one who accepted both verbally and via email.) 

If his salary is publicly available knowledge, then looking it up isn't a problem. On the other hand, if "looking it up" means something like running a database query that the general public doesn't have access to, that's a different matter. Learning public information shouldn't raise any ethical concerns, unless your profession or company has a specific "Code of Ethics" that prohibits learning this information. Here's one way to examine your own feelings about this issue - would it ruin your relationship with this colleague, if he learned that you knew his (publicly available) salary? 

Almost certainly, this was simply a case of confusion. Talk to HR, explain what you wanted to do, and learn what you can do now. In many of the public employee retirement systems these days, there is a default selection. In your case, enrollment at the standard 10% level was likely the default. If you wanted a different action, there would be forms to fill out indicating your selection. It sounds like this wasn't clear during the onboarding process. Most systems have a certain period of time to complete this enrollment, such as 120 days from the start of employment. You may still have time to change your selection. As far as "getting your money back" that may also be a misunderstanding. Once money is put into a retirement system there are ways to get that money out, but most involve a penalty and perhaps a tax hit. Perhaps what they were saying is that when you separate from this company, you can roll over the money in your retirement account to something like an IRA if you don't want to leave it in place. Again, check with HR. If you are in a public employee's union, your union can also help. (As an aside, public employee retirement systems are often very generous in their matching amounts - more so than private employers. You might wish to talk with a financial planner to consider if saving for retirement this way is in your best interest.) Being promised $X virtually always means a gross amount, not a net amount. Out of $X must come taxes, the employee's cost of benefits, etc. In this case, it doesn't sound like the employer was trying to be intentionally misleading, but perhaps didn't convey enough details for you to understand. If after discussion the entire package is less than you were hoping, you can always find a new job then quit this one.
