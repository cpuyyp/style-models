So I'd say that facial expressions certainly provide a suprasegmental and grammatical feature too, although this doesn't make them part of the sign. In other words, a sign's meaning is not incomplete without these nonmanual gestures, unless you need to provide some grammatical feature (negation, question, etc.). 

The other day I was wondering, are there occurrences of pidgins or creoles in the world of Sign languages? So I made a quick search but there doesn't seem to be much. For example, I found the Hawaii Pidgin Sign Language, but it's not an actual pidgin, it's simply named like this after the Hawaii Pidgin. So, are there examples or they simply don't exist? If they do, which are the major ones? For major, I mean most used, most established, etc. 

1: Department of Linguistics, University of Arizona. 2: "The typology of number markin", page 2. 3: "Nominal denotation", chapter starts at page 4, examples in page 5. 4: Footnote taken from the paper ("these examples" refers to the examples #7, 8): «These examples are not partitives. In Yucatec the partitive has a denite determiner between the numeral-classier and noun, e.g. ka'a-tuul le x-ch'uupal-o'ob (two-cl.an def fem-girl-pl) `two of the girls.' I thank Scott AnderBois for this question.» 

To be precise, while the IPA for ﻕ is (N.B. I'm considering standard Arabic), the one for the Georgian ყ is . The first one is a q sound, the second one is an ejective consonant (you can listen to the sound in the linked page). The main characteristic of this voiceless consonant is that it's non-pulmonic with a simultaneous closure of the glottis while it's being pronounced. Now, I don't know Georgian, but you can see in the page for the Georgian IPA that the consonant you asked for is indeed an ejective one. 

A couple of things to note: Japanese has other prefixes, mi- and on- are others I think, but even if o- and go- were the only ones, you could still call them prefixes and this is related to the second thing I was talking about: the number of them is not a criterion for establishing whether you can call them prefixes or not, correct me if I'm misinterpreting here, but I think that's what you intended in your last sentence. If -san as in Daniel-san is considered a honorific suffix, then you could call o- a honorific prefix.1 In that case it does act as a prefix, because it's attached to the word. In Japanese there's no use of hyphens in this sense, so there is no visual separation. You could argue that no distinction is made for words in Japanese in general, and no space is present between them, however the honorific is undoubtedly attached to that word and not to others. See for instance: 

Like you said, the French term salut comes from Latin and to be precise from salūs salūtis. This term appears in other Romance Languages as well: It. saluto, Es. saludo. The meaning which is health, well-being, is carried out also by other descendants: It. salute, Es. salud, Port. saúde. I don't think there is a connection to salaam which actually means peace in Arabic (I think you can confirm this meaning) and is related to the term shalom in Hebrew. You can find more about this on the Wikipedia page for Shin-Lamedh-Mem, the "the triconsonantal root of many Semitic words", at the section Salam "Peace". According to the same page, this "root itself translates as whole, safe, intact", but the triconsonantal part refers to the Š-L-M, while in salut we miss the last one and we have a T instead. There seems to be a real closeness in terms of meanings which could be a coincidence. Still, this is just a superficial analysis and I don't have all the tools/resources to absolutely exclude a link. 

Unfortunately I couldn't find anything schematic about this one yet. But you can find more about it and others in this page. 

The Malagasy language for example, national language of Madagascar, has a complex system of deixis with seven degrees of distance. Here's the tab taken from the Deixis section: 

The first portion of both is the standard way to say "I" (we'll ignore other versions for the sake of this answer). The second is a plural marker. 

Prefix: The prefix in- in italian makes a verb out of a noun or an adjective; Root: The root carries the basic meaning of the word, in this case a verb; vipera in italian is a snake, the viper. Verb Ending: This tells us without ambiguity that it's a verb, belonging to the third conjugation (Italian has 3 infinite endings: -are, -ere, -ire. This one is the third one). Reflexive particle: This tells us that the action of the verb affects the subject itself. In other words, it's the subject that turns nasty, and not someone else because of the subject's action. 

Although not for every word, the vast majority of words in Italian that start with a consonant end with a vowel, except loanwords like computer. That's because during the passage from Latin to Italian, words ending with -um and -us lost their finals and replaced those with vowels, such as Rosam -> Rosa or Lupum -> Lupo. Also Japanese works in a similar fashion, since the sounds are syllabic (CV and a CCV), except the only isolated consonant N. I don't know how this would translate to a language where every word starts with a consonant sound and ends with a vowel sound, although I don't think there would be a problem. If you're creating this language and you see that in large discourses it tends to crate problems, you could place some "device" to help diminish those consequences. 

Anaphora is a lower expenditure of cognitive effort for recovering the conceptual content of the co-referring expression (more efficient) - the identity of the content is made plain in advance. Cataphora's processing requires the creation of a temporarily empty slot until the required content is supplied (low efficiency): it is often used to generate uncertainty and to intensify receiver's interest (effectiveness). The difference The Anaphora, in the linguistics sense, makes use of deictic expressions: 

There is not a single behavior and loanwords behave differently from one another, because after all they're strictly connected to human behavior and that's quite variated even if similar across the world. The word Loanword itself is a calque from the German Lehnwort. And even Calque is a loanword from French. Calques are another thing but let's focus on loanwords. For example, in English the word web both refers to a spider's web, and to the web, the internet. Italian got this last word (from www which means world wide web), so we say "Ho portato la mia attività sul web" (I got my activity/shop on the web, online). But Italian only acquired that meaning. We don't say "C'è una web nell'angolo di quel muro" (There's a web in that wall corner). For us "Web" exclusively refers to the Internet, not to the spider's web. Loanwords often behave like this, they just refer to the object/situation/concept they referred to when they were acquired and just to that. Another example is "Corner". In English it designates a random wall/something corner, or the Corner Kick (in Soccer). In Italian if we say "È stato assegnato un corner alla squadra avversaria", we mean "the opposing team was awarded a corner kick". We won't say "Questo muro ha un corner strano", (this wall forms a weird corner). The same happens for the opposite: English say "lasagne" because the term was acquired from the collocation "Lasagne al forno/alla bolognese", not knowing that "lasagne" is a plural for us and that the singular is "lasagna". But English acquired that particular word and uses it as standard. Here's another important point: when loanwords are acquired, their original gender/number is lost and they are "reset" to work in the receiving language. In Italian we say "In questa cartella ci sono molti file" to mean "In this folder there are many files". But at a certain point, it's really hard to know what word is actually a really well-integrated loanword. I bet many Italians wouldn't know that "Grattacielo" is actually a loanword from English "Skyscraper" (cielo = sky, gratta(tore) = scraper). English and Japanese are more transparent in this case as Japanese, for example, usually adopts Katakana so you can see what words are not Japanese. The word tsunami, 津波 (tsu: harbor and nami: wave), would probably be used just to refer to the natural disaster, even if you could say "a tsunami of crime", because people will always (un)consciously link that word to those disasters and journalists will most likely prefer another word to avoid this. In conclusion there is not a single answer that will satisfy all instances concerning loanwords as each loanword has a different story and a different origin, but luckily for most recent loanwords, it's not hard to guess their history. This is also true when talking about their position in the new language: some sort of usurp the original word, others will increase the vocabulary (mostly because the receiving language didn't have a word for that concept), and so on.
