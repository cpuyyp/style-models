I know there are many languages from many families besides just Mandarin Chinese and its close relatives within China. But I was wondering if China has at least one language isolate within its borders. If more than one, which has the most speakers? If there are none, is there one language that is "least related" to other languages of the world? 

Before the beta I would've thought questions like this one would be such basic concepts that most contributors would be familiar with them. But after a few questions on gender and animacy it seems that some people do confuse the two even here. So are classifiers different to noun classes? What's the best way to sum up the differences? 

Which reminds me of another, also controversial case of multiple singular forms, but not so straightforward: 

I'm dabbling in Chinese lately and of course most of the vocabulary is new and the phonology is difficult, including tones, tone sandhi, unstressed syllables, and even some aspects of the vowels and consonants, especially in the way they map to Pinyin. But I keep wondering about when learners overcome these initial challenges, what are the other most significant aspects which present barriers to adults acquiring the language. I know Chinese has similar word order to English and they are both analytic but it can't all be plain sailing. Are there some difficult aspects of syntax, morphology, etc? 

This is a kind of corner case that might only come up in typesetting and computerized fonts since the title case digraphs and ligatures are obviously made up of an upper case initial letter plus a lower case final letter. There are a lot more analogous glyphs in Ancient Greek, where certain letters could be written as diacritical marks depending on upper vs lower vs title case. This stuff is pretty confusing and I make no claims to understand it. Here are the Greek glyphs that Unicode categorizes as "Letter, titlecase": 

Keep in mind that the A in IPA just means Alphabet and just like the Latin alphabet, it can be and is used differently for different languages, and even more than one way for the same language. Like any phonemic transcription scheme it works best with a pronunciation guide. The problem you are facing is a mapping problem. You need to decide exactly which sound is represented by each of your CPA symbols for your language and you need to decide exactly which sound is represented by each of the IPA symbols, for each of your sources if they differ. Then if you are lucky and both are based on similar analyses of the sound systems of the language in question you will have a 1:1 mapping of CPA symbols to IPA symbols. But more often than not you will not be quite this lucky and one scheme will have more symbols than the other scheme. This is where you will have to make decisions based on your knowledge of phonetics and phonology. 

In learning Lao one of the tricky things For a native English speaker is the two vowels that we don't have in English and sound very similar to us. This is compounded by the fact that both exist in short and long forms. So I'm actually looking for a minimal "quartet" ideally, and because Lao has five or six tones it's important that only the vowels contrast and not the tones, which will distract my ear and my attempts at pronunciation. The vowel sounds in question: 

When you ask most people the difference between common nouns and proper nouns they mostly can only tell you that proper nouns start with a capital letter. But this has problems: 

I'm interested in the last role. I'm actually working on a Lao syllabifier / lexical analyser. I'm sure I have read but cannot find the source that if a syllable has a tone mark it should be placed over the main initial consonant letter. Normally there is only one such letter in the initial consonant, including a placeholder / glottal stop symbol for syllables which begin with a vowel. But there are several digraphs which can commence a syllable: ຫງ, ຫຍ, ຫນ, ຫມ, ຫລ, and ຫວ. The diacritic in ຫຼ is a second Unicode character so it behaves like a digraph for my purposes too. Then there are syllables of the form where is the initial consonant letter, is the letter ວ, and is a vowel. Since ວ is a semivowel it could be seen as part of a consonant cluster grouped with the preceding consonant or part of a diphthong grouped with the succeeding vowel. In syllables without a tone mark the distinction is moot. But when there is a tone mark, does it belong over the or over the ວ? In some sources, such as my Lonely Planet Lao Phrasebook, words like ກ່ວາ (used for forming comparatives) have the tone mark over the consonant, before the ວ. In other sources, such as SEAlang, the same word is only listed under ກວ່າ, with the tone mark over the ວ. In Wiktionary there is automatic transliteration functionality for Lao which gives a correct transliteration only if the tone mark is over the . Spellings with the tone marks over the ວ always seem to have many more Google hits than the spellings with the tone marks over the , but both always exist. However this could just illustrate that popular usage does not meet prescribed orthographic norms. There is also much Lao text on the internet using old orthography so the moving tone mark could be a difference between old and new orthography. I'm interested in finding the actual true current modern standard official orthographic rule covering this, if such a rule exists. I'm also wondering whether there might be any ambiguous edge cases where two of the functions of ວ might run up against each other. Such as syllables beginning with or with followed by any of the vowels spelled with a combination of symbols that include ວ. 

I have some advice if you are quite good at the passive side of a language - comprehending via either reading or listening, but not so good at the active side - speaking or writing: 

Most languages have a fully developed concept of numbers but many do not, for instance most Australian Aboriginal languages lack numbers and counting beyond a few such as 1, 2, and 3. Many languages have indefinite articles like "a" and "an" of English but even many major world languages lack them. In all the languages I'm familiar with if they have an indefinite article it is related to or the same as the number for "one", perhaps with inflections etc. Are there any known languages however which have an indefinite article despite lacking a fully developed number system? Is it a linguistic universal that languages with an indefinite article always also have a number system? 

I've just discovered (via UniLang) a German language site on Avar: $URL$ It's set out as lessons but includes (oddly) English-Avar and Avar-English dictionaries. It has quite a bit of grammar info but seems only to cover pronounds, nouns, and adjectives. No information on the verbal system, which is usually where the meaty stuff. (Looks like it hasn't been updated in seven years so I wouldn't expect a verb section soon.) 

Most languages that don't have definite articles do seem to have determiners, demonstratives, and deictics and such like "this" and "that" that can carry some nuance of definiteness, in fact the definite articles usually derived from these. And of course there are languages with no overt marking of definiteness at all where context is sufficient to know what's being referred to most of the time. 

Some languages have special particles, prepositions, or postpositions which mark definiteness along with other attributes or functions: 

When field linguists begin to study a new language with whose speakers they don't share a common language, how do they begin? I don't need the whole story, just the very start, the "bootstrapping". For some remote languages even the nearest dominating language might be a rare exotic language for us. For example Australian languages. It's likely the native speakers won't be fluent in English but maybe Kriol instead. Would the linguist have to master that instead. The same must apply for the Caucasus, Northern Pakistan, or the Amazon jungle. I've heard this is actually done and I'm not just imagining it. Is there a standard way to start studying a completely alien language? 

In Malay there is a syllable-final with some unique properties distinct from the "normal" syllable-initial . But in all the accounts of the language I can only see a single symbol used, the regular unadorned . From the Wikipedia article on Malay phonology: 

So is there a solid cross-linguistic concept of "proper nouns" within the discipline of linguistics, and if so how is it defined? Ie what criteria would an actual linguist use to decide whether a noun is common or proper? 

Thai and Lao each have three series of stops, unvoiced unaspirated, aspirated, and voiced. For labials and alveolars, all three exist, but for velars there is no voiced stop. Is this the case for all Tai languages? For all Tai-Kadai languages? 

I had the impression that linguists these days generally consider there to be a Japonic language family consisting of Standard Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages including Okinawan, and Hachijo, spoken on another group of islands south of Tokyo. Many or all of these languages in turn have their own dialects. The distinction between dialect and language being the usual one in linguistics based on whether any two varieties are mutually intelligible. But then it was pointed out to me that the prominent Japanese linguist Masayoshi Shibatani, author of The Languages of Japan regards these all to be dialects of Japanese. The book was published fairly recently, 1990. Some years ago ISO added language codes for a number of these. UNESCO also recognized them as endangered languages. But do we know if there is a consensus among linguists on either side? 

Does Thai have have a reflex etymologically related to Lao "ບໍ່"? Does Lao have a reflex etymologically related to Thai "ไม่"? Do we know the origin of this difference? Bonus question: Which words are used in Isan and Zhuang? 

And in fact in many languages two of these are merely reflexes of a single phoneme. Sometimes all three are reflexes of the same phoneme, other times another sound may also be a reflex of the same phoneme. But I'm unable to think of any language in which any two of , , and are separate even at the phoneme level. Are there languages which have two, or all three, of these as separate phonemes? 

Mass nouns are a different phenomenon to invariant nouns which have only one form for both singular and plural such as English "sheep" so be sure not to confuse the two in your answers where you include examples from other languages. Defective nouns which have only a singular form or only a plural form (plurale tantum) such as "clothes" are also a different phenomenon to mass nouns. Mass nouns can be distinguished from invariant and defective nouns in that they cannot occur with the indefinite article, with numbers, or words like "many" and "several"; and they can occur with words like "much". Count nouns on the other hand can occur with the indefinite article, with numbers, or the word "many"; but not with the word "much". 

The Arabic letter and the Georgian letter are often described as being similar, also they are both transliterated using . 

I don't have any links or references to back up this answer but since the comments are already overflowing and I don't want it to get lost I'm adding it as an answer... I am certain that I've read in a popular linguistics book of an extreme case where a man had four first languages with each replacing the previous due to many upheavals in his early life forcing him to be moved to new language communities. I read this quite some time ago so I'm sure it wasn't on the Internet and was likely to be in a book by David Crystal or some similar writer who makes books on languages accessible to people not trained in linguistics. 

In the languages I'm familiar with I can't think of any cases of semivowels other than the "w" and "y" sounds and . So are there any others and if so, which are most common beyond these two? 

I know a bit about parsing computer languages. Generally they try to resolve all ambiguities when parsing or abort the parse and throw an error. This means you either got nothing because there was an error, or you have a neat syntax tree / AST with no ambiguities. Of course in natural languages ambiguity is rampant and has to be handled somehow. Since the same kind of syntax tree used for computer languages could not work for natural languages ("can" in an ambiguous sentence might be part of a verb phrase or part of a noun phrase depending how you look at it) I'm wondering if there is some data structure which has gained wide acceptance among NLP practitioners. A simplistic obvious approach is just to have one tree for each way of parsing a sentence, but the longer the sentence and the more ambiguities, they tend to compound and everything quickly gets out of hand. I'm expecting there is some kind of multidimensional tree used which is "flat" in the unambiguous parts of a sentence but has extra layers for each variant parse just in the ambiguous sections. Or am I barking up the wrong tree? 

According to the materials I possess or can find on the Internet, Georgian adverbs derived from nouns end in -ად (-ad) (unless the noun in the nominative ends in -ო (-o) or -უ (-u), in which case the adverb will end in -ოდ (-od) or -უდ (-ud), respectively. This is in fact the adverbial case of the noun. Adjectives also have an adverbial case which is just the bare stem without an ending. However I've just come across the word მწარედ (mtsared) "bitterly" which is related to the word მწარე (mtsare) "bitter". As you can see it ends in -ედ (-ed). Is this just an irregular inflection peculiar to this word, or is there a regular adjective → adverb process that I just haven't been able to find? 

Lao has five tones (like Thai) in the south. But Lao has six tones in the north. ... In the capital, Vientiane, which is supposed to set the standard for the Lao language, there has been an ongoing debate about whether the local spoken variety has five or six tones. I encountered teaching materials bluntly stating five, others bluntly stating six, and others mentioning the debate before arbitrarily choosing one analysis or the other before continuing. 

(I've arbitrarily used as the base consonant. Vowel length is unfortuately not reflected in the common transliteration schemes.) I realize it's not always possible to find perfect minimal pairs and that's going to be even harder with four contrasting sounds rather than two, so "near minimal pairs" are acceptable. I'd prefer short common words that I'll be able use. (There are also diphthongs with each vowel followed by schwa: , , , and so bonus points if you can include those!) 

I know that in the case of Mandarin Chinese questions do not end with any kind of rising tone unless the last morpheme in the sentence happens to have a rising tone. For questions which don't contain a question word (equivalent of English wh-words) it's usual for questions to end with the particle "ma" with the neutral tone. "Ma" with the rising tone, tone 2 in Mandarin, has other meanings including "hemp", "sesame", and "numb". But what about other tonal languages such as Lao, Thai, Vietnamese? What about tonal languages outside (South)East Asia such as those in Africa? 

I believe that orange is not just a recently introduced fruit in many parts but that the concept of a colour word for this shade is also recent. Recall that many languages do just fine with much fewer colour words than English has. In some languages "orange" doesn't always have full status as a normal adjective but may sometimes be a circumlocution like "orange colour" or "colour of orange". 

But what options do we have when we want to do narrow transcriptions to illustrate the actual sounds in detail? 

I've always had trouble with the distinction between the "e"-like vowels in European languages: vs . But pronouncing them the same has never caused me any problems. In fact I don't even know whether my English "short e" is vs . I seem to recall it varies by English variety, even for IPA use (I always use for English IPA). In my idiolect there may even be some kind of merger. "Head" is and "haired" is where could be either or - I'm not sure. So now I'm in Korea trying to improve my Korean. Up until now I had always pronounced "ㅐ" as and "ㅔ" as whatever my English "short e" is. But lately people have been correcting me and telling me "ㅐ" should be what to me sounds like "short e". Having done some reading I find Korean doesn't have as I'd thought, but has two contrasting vowels that would both fall into the "short e" category for my idiolect: "ㅐ" is and "ㅔ" is . How can I learn to distinguish these sounds correctly, both for listening and speaking? If I learn it for Korean it will also help for my linguistics generally. Are there some minimal pairs in Korean I can practice with with my native Korean speaking friends here? (It's not easy trying to explain to non-linguists with imperfect English what minimal pairs are.)
