One could see this in the following way. We have $$\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(c_1)$$ where $c_1 = c_1(\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n}) = c_{1}(\bigwedge^n\Omega_{\mathbb{P}^n}) = c_1(\Omega_{\mathbb{P}^n})$ is the first Chern class. Now, by the Euler's exact sequence $$0\mapsto\Omega_{\mathbb{P}^n}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-1)^{\oplus (n+1)}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}\mapsto 0$$ we get $$c_1(\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n}) = c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-1)^{\oplus (n+1)})-c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}) = -n-1.$$ Therefore $$\omega_{\mathbb{P}^n} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-n-1).$$ 

Smooth varieties Let $X$ be a smooth uniruled variety. Then there is a free rational curve $f:\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow X$, that is $H^1(\mathbb{P}^1,f^*T_X\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(-1)) = 0$. Now $f^{*}T_X$ is a rank $n = dim(X)$ vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Therefore we can write $$f^*T_X = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a_1)\oplus...\oplus\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(a_n).$$ Now, $f^{*}T_X$ contains $T_{\mathbb{P}^1}\cong\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1}(2)$. We have $K_X\cdot f_*\mathbb{P}^1 = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i\leq -2$. Therefore, $X$ uniruled implies that there is a free rational curve on $X$ which implies that $K_X$ is not nef. So, if $K_X$ is ample (in particular $K_X$ is nef) then $X$ is not uniruled. Now, $X$ unirational $\Rightarrow$ $X$ rationally connected $\Rightarrow$ $X$ uniruled $\Rightarrow$ $K_X$ is not nef (in particular $K_X$ is not ample). In other terms. If $X$ is uniruled then $X$ has nagative Kodaira dimension. If the canonical bundle of $X$ is ample (it is enough big) then $X$ has Kodaira dimension $dim(X)$. Singular varieties There are singular uniruled varieties with ample canonical bundle. In particular there are many examples of rational singular surfaces with ample canonical bundle. The following example is due to Kollar. You can find the details and many other interesting constructions here $URL$ Let us consider the surface $$Y = Y(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) := (x_1^{a_1}x_2 + x_2^{a_2}x_3 + x_3^{a_3}x_4 + x_4^{a_4}x_1 = 0)$$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$, such that $$a_1w_1+w_2 = a_2w_2 + w_3 = a_3w_3 + w_4 = a_4w_4+w_1 = d$$ and $$\begin{array}{ll} w_1 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_2 a_3 a_4-a_3 a_4+a_4-1), & w_2 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_3 a_4-a_1 a_4+a_1-1),\\ w_3 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_4-a_1 a_2 + a_2-1), & w_4 = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_3- a_2 a_3 + a_3-1), \end{array}$$ $$d = \frac{1}{w^*}(a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4-1)$$ where $w^* = \gcd(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4).$ If $w^* = 1$, then $Y$ is a rational surface with $4$ cyclic singularities and $H_2(Y, \mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}^3$. The rational curves $$C_1 := (x_1 = x_3 = 0),\quad C_2 := (x_2 = x_4 = 0)$$ are extremal rays with respect the $K_Y + (1- \epsilon)(C_1 + C_2)$ minimal model program for $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$. Therefore $C_1$ and $C_2$ are contractible to quotient singularities and we get a rational surface of Picard number 1, $$\pi : Y=Y(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4) \rightarrow X = X(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4).$$ If $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \geq 4$, then $K_{X}$ is ample. For examples of big surfaces with big cotangent bundle you could take a look at this $URL$ For a classification of complex compact Gorenstein surfaces with negative canonical bundle you can read this $URL$ A classical example of a rational surface with negative canonical bundle is the quadric cone in $\mathbb{P}^3$. The canonical divisor $K_S$ is $-2H_{|S}$, where $H$ is a plane in $\mathbb{P}^3$ through the vertex. 

I don't have a full answer, but the following calculation may be useful. Consider the example $G = SL_3$ so that $N$ is the Heisenberg group on three generators and in characteristic zero, $\bar{U}(N)$ is the enveloping algebra of the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. Thus $\bar{U}(N) = k[x,z][y ; z \frac{d}{dx}]$ is a skew polynomial algebra. This notation means that every element in $\bar{U}(N)$ can be written uniquely in the form $\sum_{i=0}^r f_i y^i$ for some $f_i \in k[x,z]$ and $y$ satisfies the commutation relation $ad(y)(f) := y f - f y = z \frac{df}{dx}$ for any $f \in k[x,z]$. Note that $z$ is a central element in $\bar{U}(N)$. Now consider the element $y^a \cdot x^b$ for any $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us rewrite it in standard form as follows: $y^a x^b = l_y^a(x^b) = (r_y + ad(y))^a(x^b) = $ $\left(\sum_{i=0}^a\binom{a}{i} r_y^{a-i} ad(y)^i \right)(x^b) = \sum_{i=0}^a \binom{a}{i} \frac{b!}{(b-i)!}z^i x^{b-i} y^{a-i}$. Here $l_y$ and $r_y$ are operators of left-multiplication by $y$ and right-multiplication by $y$, respectively. Note that they commute, so $r_y$ and $ad(y) = l_y - r_y$ also commute, so the application of the binomial theorem is legal. So in this case you can take $f(a,b) = a + b - \max(a,b)$. 

The variety $Y$ you constructed is terminal. It is singular at the point where $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ is contracted. However this singularity is normal. Now, you can write $C$ as $\{y^2-x^3-x^2=z=0\}\subset\mathbb{A}^3$. The blow-up $Z$ of $\mathbb{A}^3$ along $Z$ is defined by $\{s(y^2-x^3-x^2)-tz=0\}\subset\mathbb{A}^3\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Note that $Z$ has a unique singular point, namely $((0,0,0),[1:0])$ which is an ordinary double point. Therefore, $Z$ is terminal. Since there exists at most a unique terminal extraction of $C$ we get $Y\cong Z$. 

The answer is yes. Let's say that a domain $R$ has the intersection property if every non-zero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$ has non-zero intersection with the centre of $R$. The result follows from the Theorem and Lemma below. 

No. If $A = k[x,y]$ is the polynomial ring in two variables, $\mathfrak{p}$ is the zero ideal, $N = A_{\mathfrak{p}} = k(x,y)$ is the field of fractions of $A$, $M := (x,y) \subsetneq M' := A \subseteq N$ all satisfy your conditions. But the only associated prime of $M' / M$ is $(x,y)$ which has height $2$. 

You may assume that $T$ is irreducible. You have $f(C)\subseteq e(C\times T)$. Then $dim(e(C\times T)) \geq 1$. If $dim(e(C\times T)) = 1$ then $e(C\times T) = f(C)$. This implies that for any $t\in T$ the image of the morphism $f_t$ corresponding to $t$ is $f(C)$. Now, two morphisms $f_t:C\rightarrow f(C)$ and $f_{t^{'}}:C\rightarrow f(C)$ such that $f_{t}(c) = f_{t^{'}}(c)$ differ by an automorphism of the pointed curve $(C,c)$. That is, there exists an automorphism $\alpha:C\rightarrow C$ such that $\alpha(c) = c$ and $ f_{t^{'}} = f_{t}\circ\alpha$. Since $C$ is smooth and $g\geq 1$ we have that $Aut(C,c)$ is finite. A contradiction because we assumed that $dim(e(C\times T)) = 1$. Therefore $dim(e(C\times T)) \geq 2$. 

To add to the answer above, I'd like to advertise the so-called sumless Sweedler notation here. This notation works as follows: let $C$ be a coalgebra; then if $c \in C$ then we write $\Delta(c) = c_1 \otimes c_2$ as an abbreviation of the more precise $\Delta(c) = \sum_{i=1}^k c_{i1} \otimes c_{i2}$ for some $c_{i1}, c_{i2} \in C, i = 1,\ldots, k$. Then if we wish to consider $(1 \otimes \Delta) \circ \Delta : C \to C\otimes C \otimes C$ we simply write $$[(1 \otimes \Delta) \circ \Delta] (c) = c_1 \otimes c_2 \otimes c_3.$$ In this notation, the coassociativity axiom $(1 \otimes \Delta) \circ \Delta = (\Delta \otimes 1) \circ \Delta$ becomes the inevitable $$ c_1 \otimes (c_2 \otimes c_3) = (c_1 \otimes c_2) \otimes c_3.$$ Sweedler's book "Hopf algebras", Susan Montgomery's book "Hopf algebras and their actions on rings" and the Wikipedia article $URL$ are good references.

$X$ is a Mori Dream Space, i.e. $Cox(X)$ is finitely generated. Indeed $X$ is a toric variety if and only if $X$ is a Mori Dream Space and $Cox(X)$ is a polynomial ring. $X$ is log Fano, in particular $-K_X$ is big and movable. Any nef divisor is semiample. 

If $G$ is a group with centre $Z$ such that $G/Z$ is cyclic, then necessarily $G$ is abelian. So no such group can exist. 

Over a general ring (not necessarily commutative), every finitely presented flat module is projective. So, one simple condition on the ring that gives you what you want is that every finitely generated module is finitely presented. Of course, these are just the (left) Noetherian rings. 

In particular you can find details about both Mayer-Vietoris and Leray Spectral sequences. Another good reference: 

If I interpreted correctly your question I guess the answer is positive. Here is the statement: Let $f:Y\rightarrow X$ be a proper birational morphism between normal $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial varieties, and let $D$ be an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor in $X$. Let us write $$K_Y = f^{*}(K_X+D)+\sum_{i}a_iE_i-\widetilde{D}$$ where $E_i$ are $f$-exceptional divisors and $\widetilde{D}$ is the strict transform of $D$. If $a_i \leq 0$ for any $i$, and $mult_y(\widetilde{D}-\sum_{i}a_iE_i) < 1$ for any $y\in Y$ , then the pair $(X,D)$ is klt. To prove this you can proceed as follows. We have $\widetilde{D}-\sum_{i}a_iE_i = \widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i$ with $b_i = -a_i \geq 0$. Then, $\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i$ is effective. Since $mult_y(\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i) < 1$ for any $y\in Y$, by Proposition 9.5.13 of "Positivity in Algebraic Geometry 2" we have that the multiplier ideal $\mathcal{I}(\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i)$ is trivial. Then, by Section 9.3.B of "Positivity in Algebraic Geometry 2" we get that $(Y,\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i)$ is klt. Now, we may write $$K_Y+\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i = K_Y+\widetilde{D}-\sum_{i}a_iE_i = f^{*}(K_X+D).$$ Finally, since $(Y,\widetilde{D}+\sum_{i}b_iE_i)$ is klt, by Lemma 3.10 in $URL$ the pair $(X,D)$ is klt as well. 

Since $\ker A = \ker A^2$, the map $\bar{A} : V/\ker A \to V/\ker A$ is injective. Since $V/\ker A$ is finite dimensional, this map is surjective. So for any $x \in V$ we can find $y \in V$ and $z \in \ker A$ such that $x = Ay + z$. Now suppose $ABx = 0$ and let $x = Ay + z$ as above. Then $0 = ABx = ABAy + ABz = A^2By + BAz = A^2By$ because $AB = BA$ and $Az = 0$. So $By \in \ker A^2 = \ker A$ whence $ABy = 0$. So $B(Ay) = 0$ and $Ay \in \ker B$. Hence $x = Ay + z \in \ker B + \ker A$. 

The answer is no. You can see this by iterating a standar Cremona transformation. Let $p_1,...,p_{n+1}\in\mathbb{P}^n$ be general points. We may assume $$p_1 = [1:0:...:0],...,p_{n+1} = [0:...:0:1].$$ We consider the standard Cremona transformation: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} \psi:\mathbb{P}^n & \dashrightarrow & \mathbb{P}^n\\ \left[x_0:...:x_n\right] & \longmapsto & [\frac{1}{x_0}:...:\frac{1}{x_n}] \end{array} $$ Note that $\psi\circ \psi = Id_{\mathbb{P}^n}$, and $\psi^{-1} = \psi$. Let $H_1,...,H_{n+1}$ be the coordinate hyperplanes of $\mathbb{P}^n$. Then $\psi$ is not defined on the locus $$\bigcup_{1\leq i< j\leq n+1}H_i\cap H_j.$$ Furthermore, $\psi$ is an isomorphism off of the union $$\bigcup_{1\leq i\leq n+1}H_i.$$ Let $X_{n+1}^n$ be the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^n$ is the $n+1$ base points of the Cremona. Now, $\psi$ induces a birational transformation $\widetilde{\psi}:X_{n+1}^n\dashrightarrow X_{n+1}^n$. Note that, since $\psi$ contracts the hyperplane $H_i$ passing spanned by the $n$ points $p_1,...,\hat{p}_i,...,p_{n+1}$ to the point $p_i$, the map $\widetilde{\psi}$ maps the strict transform of $H_i$ onto the exceptional divisor $E_i$. Therefore $\widetilde{\psi}$ is an isomorphism in codimension one. Indeed, it is a composition of flops. In particular $\widetilde{\psi}$ induces an isomorphism $Pic(X_{n+1}^n)\rightarrow Pic(X_{n+1}^n)$. Now, the linear system on $\mathbb{P}^n$ associated to the standard Cremona $\psi$ is $$\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(n)\otimes \mathcal{I}_{(n-1)(p_1+...+p_{n+1})},$$ that is $\mathcal{H}$ is the linear system of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $n$ having points of multiplicity at least $n-1$ in $p_1,...,p_{n+1}$. Therefore, the inverse image of a general hyperplane of $\mathbb{P}^n$ via $\psi$ is an hypersurface of degree $n$ with points of multiplicity $n-1$ in $p_1,...,p_{n+1}$, and $$\widetilde{\psi}^{*}H = nH-(n-1)(E_1+...+E_{n+1}).$$ Furthermore, since $\psi$ contracts the hyperplane $H_i$ passing spanned by the $n$ points $p_1,...,\hat{p}_i,...,p_{n+1}$ to the point $p_i$ we have $$\widetilde{\psi}^{*}E_i = H-E_1-...-\hat{E}_i-...-E_{n+1}.$$ Let $D\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ be an hypersurface of degree $d$ having points of multiplicities $m_1,...,m_{n+1}$ in $p_1,...,p_{n+1}$, and let $\psi:\mathbb{P}^{n}\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$ be the standard Cremona of $\mathbb{P}^n$. Then $$\deg(\psi(D)) = dn-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}m_i$$ and $$mult_{p_i}\psi(D) = d(n-1)-\sum_{j\neq i}m_j$$ for any $i = 1,...,n+1$. proof: Let $X_{n+1}^n = Bl_{p_1,...,p_{n+1}}\mathbb{P}^n$, and $\widetilde{\psi}:X_{n+1}^n\dashrightarrow X_{n+1}^n$ be the birational map induced by $\psi$. The strict transform of $D$ in $X_{n+1}^n\dashrightarrow X_{n+1}^n$ can be written as $\widetilde{D} \cong dH-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}m_iE_i$.\ Now, since $\widetilde{\psi}_{*}H = nH-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(n-1)E_i$, and $\widetilde{\psi}_{*}E_i = H-\sum_{j\neq i}E_i$ we get $$ \begin{array}{ll} \widetilde{\psi}_{*}D = & d(nH-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}E_i)-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}m_i(H-\sum_{j\neq i}E_j)=\\ & dnH-d\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(n-1)E_i-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}H+\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}m_i\sum_{j\neq i}E_j =\\ & (dn-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}m_i)H-\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(d(n-1)-\sum_{j\neq i}m_j)E_j. \end{array} $$ Now, assume there exists an hypersurface $X$ of degree $d = 6$ in $\mathbb{P}^4$ with eight points of multiplicity four. Consider a standard Cremona $f_1$ centred in five of this eight points. Let $X_1 = f(X)$. Then $X_1$ is an hypersurface of degree $d_1 = 4$ with five points of multiplicity $2$ and three points of multiplicity $4$. Now consider another standard Cremona $f_2$ centred in three points of multiplicity $2$ of $X_1$, and two points of multiplicity $4$ of $X_1$. Then $X_2 =f_2(X_1)$ is an hypersurface of degree $4\cdot 4-4-4-2-2-2 = 2$ with a point of multiplicity $4$. A contradiction.
