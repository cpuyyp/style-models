I won't give you a complete answer as this looks like homework, but I'll give you a hint: You need to look at the possible values of A. What is implied when A is true? And what happens when A is false? 

Because this looks like homework, I won't give you a full answer, but just a hint. I also don't know what SD is (unless you mean Service-dominant logic, which is off topic here and doesn't seem applicable), but here's a method for propositional logic. You could make a truth table of parts of your expression. Like this: 

Yes, it can, however, you'll have to be sure that it cannot be written by a human, also not unconsciously. In the last century, many good songs have been made while the artists were under the influence of drugs. It wouldn't be a valid reasoning to say those songs couldn't have been written by a normal human being thus by a higher power - people can apparently do stuff that are supernatural. 

I'm not sure what translation you are using, but the question you marked at (3) doesn't seem properly translated. Paul Shorey translated the question as: 

What this remarkable statement says is that the British government systematically and sustainedly denied the people of the colonies to what it calls "unalienable Rights" endowed by man's Creator. Because the previous Government was not constructive, but "destructive of these ends", it became necessary for the colonies "to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with [Britain]". It's not explicitly stated here, but the colonies did not have the power to alter the previous Government and therefore was left only with the power to abolish it. It appears that the Southern states saw the US Government in much the same light as the Founding Fathers saw the British Government. It seems that Lincoln did not see things that way. His most well-known, and perhaps best, statement of his position on the war comes from his Gettysburg Address: 

So also in this writing which is not part of "the Bible" we read that also the opponents agreed that the tomb was empty – just not why. 

As a counter example you could use for example a family crisis. Violence would stop the family crisis in the end (when taken to the extreme of murder, which is what your opponent is likely to argue). You could then say that indeed the family crisis is non-existent after application of violence, but the actual problem (lack of love, ...) hasn't been solved. In other words: find a problem that cannot be solved by violence / disagreement because violence / disagreement is the very problem itself. 

From the standpoint of most critics of these philosophies, there is no difference. An analogous situation is the diversity of thought that falls under the umbrella of Marxism: communism, socialism, Leninism, Bolshevism, Trotskyism, Maoism, and even state monopoly capitalism. To a critic, all of those categories are meaningless since they reject at some level or another the principles of capitalistic economic theory. They are distinctions of no import to a critic. Obviously, a proponent of one of these subphilosophies (hierarchically speaking) would make many distinctions between their positions and others which from outside seem similar. It's the nature of the beast. As someone wholly outside, it seems to me that the difference is whether the goal is to alter humanity to some specific endpoint (posthumanism) or whether simple improvement is in view (transhumanism). It seems likely that the later used term is a correction, expansion, or clarification of the earlier term. (This seems to be the pattern: Platonists are followed by neo-Platonists. Marxism is followed by Marxist–Leninism.) According to Wikipedia, "transhumanism" was coined in 1957. The original definition of transhuman according to Julian Huxley: 

However, in this case, there is no argument. Alice says something which we know is not true. Then if Alice had used an argument to argue "Bob is smart", that argument would probably have been fallacious. But the simple act of saying something untrue is not fallacious, because there is no reasoning involved. 

Longer explanation: There is a very intuitive mathematical rule that says that we can change the name of bound variables (variables can be bound by existential or universal quantification). Basically, it means that the following two are equivalent: 

A tautology is always true. Therefore, if the conclusion of the argument is a tautology, the conclusion is always true, which means it's impossible for the premises of the argument to be true and the conclusion nevertheless false, which is the definition of the argument's validity. It's somewhat peculiar that that textbook talks about validity without first defining it. It's a pretty straightforward definition, but usually these books are very precise. 

As a Christian, I would argue that God (and God alone) is worthy of my worship whether or not He does miracles, changes my life for the best, or allows me to experience eternal happiness. That He did this is an undeserved favor to humanity. The standard Christian belief conforms to what Paul of Tarsus once wrote: 

To address the Theory of Grue, we must object to it not on the basis of deductive reasoning, but on the more fundamental basis of the reliability of our senses: green objects look green and our instincts suggest they will remain green and not magically turn blue in the future. As we must begin all reasoning with the assumption of our own reliable senses, it is and always will be an axiom we must accept without justification. 

* Not only do we find this in Matthew, we also find this in the non-canonical gospel of Peter (vv. 37-38, 43, 49): 

That would never form a valid reasoning. A valid logical reasoning has to be universal, independent from current statistics of human behaviour. For example, when the statistics would change over time, that would also mean the 'truthiness' of the statement would change over time as well. That isn't possible with such a universal thing as a god. 

Charles Taylor writes in the preface of Sources of the Self (p. x, Harvard University Press 1989), emphasis mine: 

Let's assume it is okay to hurt someone in order to reproduce yourself. Then... Is this still moral when it's a crime? As I stated above, crimes aren't per definition immoral.
