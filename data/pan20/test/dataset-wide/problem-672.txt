I am using Headphones like this: They even reduce wind noise, and you can hear the music and everything around you, because they are not blocking outside noise. The problem is that in city traffic you will not hear the music, because the cars are so loud ;D Important is that they have foam, cause that reduces the wind noise. 

I have transported a lot of loads like this on my bicycle rack without problems. The load should be no problem for a usual bicycle rack but there might be a problem with the balance, so you will need to strap it down pretty good. With strapping down comes more pressure on the package, that might mean you might need a more stable package. For strapping I use old tubes. They are elastic, nearly unbreakable and if you form a knot it will not get off so easily. Another argument is that there is no scratching of your bicycles paint. Just use 3 of them, tie 2 trough the rack and one through the seatpost and you should be ready to go. I always have an old tube on my rack in case I need to carry some stuff. 

The only thing that I would worry about is your comfort/security because of the efficiency of the suspension. Suspension only works if most of the weight is suspended. When you are putting the weight in non suspended areas you are effectively reducing the efficiency of your suspension. So if you are only doing light offroad and are using it for comfort it should be ok, but if you have some downhills with sticks, stones and roots where you really use the suspension it could get dangerous! This could be avoided by putting in only light things like clothing. Also your load will be shaken pretty good, but that should be no problem if you are putting in what you are describing. But avoid electronics, cameras, cookies ... A bottle might jump out of a bottle cage. Else the mounting looks good and stable, and I think there should be no damage to the suspension fork. 

In Germany, all bicycle lights above a certain lumen value have to have a low beam feature, so it's pretty standard here. So, if you do not want to kludge your existing headlight get a german one, e.G. Busch und Mueller Headlights always have a low beam feature, which they especially advertise. Here is their english web page. $URL$ 

I got a pump with an head like this, and I use both the presta and the schraeder opening. The problem is that the automatic switching does not seem to work as well as it once did. It is pretty random where the air comes out, and most of the time it involves a lot of shaking and cursing before I can get my tires pumped up. Can I fix this somehow? The pump was not cheap, and I would like to avoid getting a new one, though the hassle of getting air out of the correct hole is annoyinng. This question is about a Pump Head, where the mechanism does work (air only comes out of one hole), but switches pretty randomly. I want to get an answer if there is a solution without replacing the head, else i would order a new pump head. 

You're not typically carrying heavy loads while randonneuring, any quality, road hub should work. I think an MTB hub is overkill. I've used American Classic hubs for MTB race wheels, but I probably would not choose American Classic for randonneuring. I have thousands of brevet and randonnee miles on Shimano Ultegra, Cycle Ops Power Tap, and Schmidt SON hubs, and have yet to have a problem. You didn't mention if you're planning to build the hub into the old rim, or get a new wheel, of what type of drivetrain you have. Those factors might also influence your choice. 

1) Check your shorts for seams, tags or chamois edges that could be causing chafing. Try different brands of shorts. 2) Check saddle edges and try a smoother/narrower nose saddle as others have suggested. 3) Check your seat post saddle clamp. Your thighs may be rubbing on it. If so you can try a different one or try smoothing the edges with Sugru. 4) Shorts/saddle combination can make a difference. I have shorts that chafe with one type of saddle, but don't chafe and are very comfortable on another. They're are no rules as to what combinations work. It's very individual since the rider's anatomy is the third part of that mix. 5) Try to determine if moisture is a big contributor to the chafing or if it's primarily caused by rubbing. If it's moisture, a powder like "Monkey Butt" powder can help. If not, chamois cream in liberal amounts may help. Another option is Lantiseptic. It's primary purpose is to prevent bedsores. When applied to dry skin it creates a moisture barrier and serves as a skin protectant. It's used by many randonneurs for chamois cream. It can also be difficult to wash out of shorts so it's generally something you don't want to use every ride, only if you're going to be out for several hours. 

You can buy a new frame or order a custom frame with S&S couplers. Some builders will also add them after market to some frames; usually steel or titanium. S&S couplers add around 1 pound to the weight of a single frame. Another lighter, cheaper option is Ritchey Break-away frames. They're available in steel or titanium, road or cross configurations. Some people have suggested the Break-away may not be as stiff as S&S, but it's easy to find happy owners of both on forums. I only have first hand experience with S&S couplers on a steel tandem. They were problem-free in that application. 

I don't necessarily recommend it, but I own a Vitus 979 and did this about 10 years ago so I could upgrade to a 9 speed cassette and STI shifters. I haven't had any problems with it. But I haven't put a lot of miles on it since the change and I'm under 150 lbs. Some of those miles have been on dirt roads. I stripped the frame about a year ago and the dropouts measure about 128.5 empty. The idea about trying to narrow the hub won't work because 1) you need the space to fit all the sprockets in the cassette 2) if you try to make space only on the left side your wheel alignment will be whacky 3) most modern hubs don't have spacers or cone washers that can be deleted from the assembly. One reason, I haven't ridden it much since is because afterwards I never felt totally confident about the integrity of the frame. Also, once I was able to afford a new bike I enjoyed riding the new one more. I think you are better off keeping your Vitus as a classic and saving a up to buy a new bike with modern components. If you're still considering it, remember that my experiment of one doesn't mean you'll have the same success. 

Well. I think that you really want this you have to build something youself. Basically you will need a light without a condensator and this circuit. Just add it to the power cable and have fun. $URL$ IMHO flashing lights are not optimal because they reduce the ability to gauge distances. A better approach might be to use a really bright rear light, or one with the braking light functionality e.G. the light from Bush and Mueller Toplight Line Plus 

I have this bike for a year now and I am pretty happy with it. It does not allow very sportive riding, but it is nearly maintenance-less, since the chain is fully enclosed by the protector (which rattles sometimes). The rear rack allows mounting a Basket. I check the chain every 3 Months, and there are still no signs of rust or that the original oiling has diminished. The transmission is very good for city riding and pulling a trailer up a hill, but not so good for going fast on roads (35 - 40 kph max possible if you have to pedal). The brakes are also very good, the only maintainence required is filling them with some special oil, and they have no problem braking the bike going down a steep hill with a fully loaded trailer. The bike has built in lightning that is very bright, with a hub dynamo. This is a photo of my bike in action, with full loading capacity of about 60 kg (30 kg on the trailer, 30 kg on the rack). Total cost of the Bike, as you see it here (with trailer and baskets and airzound) was 1500 €, Maintenance cost is around 30 € per year. 

I am from the Bike Lobby in Austria, and we are doing security checks together with the police. We make a checkpoint, the police stops all cyclists and checks their equipment. If everything is O.K. we give the rider a goodie, like some chocolate If something is amiss we have a repair tent nearby where we fix the problems. We have reflectors for free, and do repairs e.g. for dynamo powered lights for free. If there are some components missing (battery lights) we sell them cheaply. If someone does not want to fix their lights (happens rarely) he will not be fined, but has to push his bike. This works great, and we have pushed the light quota from 60% to 95% in the city we are doing this kind of activities. It requires a lot of effort and support from the government though. We run 12 of these checkpoints on different places in the city, always in the weeks before or after the change from daylight saving time to normal time. This activity is sponsored by the government, they are paying the costs for the repair tent and some of the equipment and goodies. So summarizing: Instead of trying on your own, better work together with some people and get organized. This approach works! Infos about the Event in German 

You should focus on sustained efforts of 12 min to 1 hour. While specialized equipment; e.g. heart rate and power meters, can be helpful in maintaining motivation and gauging if you're backing off your effort, they aren't required. You can use RPE, rate of perceived exertion. Its also helpful to find a route of about 1 hour and challenge yourself to match or beat your best time every week or so. Similarly you could use a fixed segment to do intervals of ~12 min. Do several repeats in one session and try to get faster each time. 

How much air did you lose? What types of tires/tubes/rim strips? What tire pressure did you start your ride with? A few possibilities: 1) Did you replace the rim strip/tape in each rim when you replaced the tubes and tires? 2) You may have made a small hole in the tube when installing either by improperly using a tool to reseat the tire or by catching the tube between the rim and tire bead. 3) You may have a slow leak caused by something you rode over; a thorn, glass, etc. Or you could have a pinch-flat caused by riding over a curb or rock. 4) If the tubes have removable valve cores make sure they're not loose. 

Another option is hand wipes, like baby wipes without the baby odor. Wet Ones Big Ones are my favorite. There are other (more expensive) brands made specifically for cleaning bikes. I use them to clean my bike when traveling in the Netherlands and other places where it's not easy to wash my bike with a bucket or hose. 

Time matters more than distance, but 1 km is a very short ride. She shouldn't have a lot of pain the next day. Either she was wearing poor clothing, the saddle shape, or bike fit are really bad for her, or she hit a bump hard, or some combination of those things. Or she doesn't really want to ride. First find out if she WANTS to ride. If she does, make sure the bike fits her. Unless she has been very inactive up to now, the fact that her arms hurt after only 1k would lead me to suspect the bars are too low or too wide, saddle nose is tilted down too much, the stem too long, or the frame is too big. Saddle fore/aft position should not be used to adjust the reach to the bars. Fore/aft adjustments are to position the rider's lower body properly in relation to the crank. Get her some padded shorts and chamois cream and instruct her how to wear them; i.e. no underwear. Possibly try a cushier saddle. Problems with cushier saddles generally don't manifest until one starts doing longer rides. Make adjustments she requests. These may be pretty frequent at first. Until she's riding at least 10 miles a few times a week don't worry about trying to find the perfect saddle for her. Also note, bigger, wider, softer saddles are NOT better for all women. Nor is woman's saddle always best. Myself and a friend are two who are most comfortable on narrow, hard, "men's" saddles. Many women I know who ride regularly prefer men's saddles. Some women are most comfortable with a cut-out. Others find cut-outs extremely painful. I've also known women who weren't comfortable until the nose of their saddle was tilted down significantly. Shorts/saddle combination can also make a huge difference. There isn't one style of saddle that's best for all of us. It comes down to differences in individual anatomy, as well as shorts and riding styles. The Team Estrogen forums are a great resource to help women find saddles that might be comfortable for them, but ultimately saddles need to be tested for awhile. If you don't have a shop nearby with a good saddle try-out policy, eBay can be a way to try out different saddles for an extended time.
