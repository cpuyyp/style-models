The following trick uses some relatively deep mathematics, namely cluster algebras. It will probably impress (some) mathematicians, but not very many laypeople. Draw a triangular grid and place 1s in some two rows, like the following except you may vary the distance between the 1s: 

A random $k$-coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ is more likely to be proper than a random $(k-1)$-coloring of the same graph. (A vertex coloring is proper if no two adjacent vertices are colored identically. In this case, random means uniform among all colorings, or equivalently, that each vertex is i.i.d. colored uniformly from the space of colors.) 

If you are sometimes called upon directing a random walk in a directed graph, how should you direct it so as to maximize the probability it goes where you want? Formal statement More specifically, suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ with edge weights, two designated vertices $s$ and $t$, and a subset of the vertices $S$. The edges weights represent the transition probabilities of the random walk, the vertex $s$ the start, the vertex $t$ the target, and the set $S$ the set of switches. You are guaranteed that the weights on the out-edges of any node are non-negative and sum to one, that $t$ is absorbing (i.e., $t$ has one out-edge directed towards itself), and that the out-degree of any vertex in $S$ is exactly two. A random walk is taken on $G$, starting at $s$. For any given vertex not in $S$, the weight on an out-edge is the probability that the walk will travel in that direction. Every time that the walk reaches a switch (a vertex in $S$), you are allowed to choose which of the two edges the walk will travel along (and you are allowed probabilistic strategies). How should you direct the path if you want to maximize the probability that the walk ends up at your target $t$? Questions I am most interested in this as an algorithmic question. How fast can you find the optimal strategy with respect to the size of the graph? My specific application has about 100 switches among 200 vertices in a fairly sparse graph (say out-degree bounded above by 6). But we can also ask purely mathematical questions. For example, my intuition says (and I can hand-wave a proof) that there exists an optimal strategy that is deterministic in the sense that it always chooses the same direction for a given switch and this direction does not depend on the initial vertex $s$. Is this actually true? Also, is there a sense in which the optimal strategy needs to "coordinate" among the switches? That is, is there a local optimum that is not a global optimum? Notes A note on connectivity: we may assume that the graph is sufficiently connected. If not, we can identify all vertices that cannot be reached from the start node, as well as all of those that cannot reach the target node, into a single, absorbing fail state. We may assume the start node is not the fail node. 

Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold, with $R$ nowhere-vanishing vector field on $M$(whose orbit may be closed/ not closed). $E$ and $F$ are two vector bundle (Edit: which are sub-bundles of $\Omega^*(M, \mathfrak{g})$, namely forms valuded in Lie-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$) over $M$ with the same rank. Denote $\tilde \Gamma(E)$ and $\tilde \Gamma(F)$ the sections of $E$ and $F$ that are invariant under $R$, namely, for instance $\mathcal{L}_R \tilde \sigma_{E} = 0$. Let $D$ be some differential operator $D: \tilde \Gamma(E) \to \tilde \Gamma(F)$, which obviously commutes with $\mathcal{L}_R$. My target $\dim{\rm ker}D - \dim \ker D^*$. What is the corresponding framework to do this? What is the property of $D$ for this quantity to be well defined? Any reference will be appreciated!(I have basic knowledge about usual index-theorem for elliptic complex) Thanks. 

In Blair's book and many many literatures, I see definition of a contact metric manifold which involves a relation \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} as well as other standard relation like ${\Phi ^2} = - 1 + R \otimes \kappa $, $\Phi R = 0$, etc. On the other hand, in Tanno's papers and a few others literatures, the definitions involves \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = 2 g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} differing from Blair's by a factor of $2$. So I try to figure out which is "more correct", and then comes one important equation that really confuses me, in Blair's book (Lemma 6.2): \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X - \Phi hX, \;\;\;\;h \propto \mathcal{L}_R \Phi\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*) \end{equation} Now, let us consider the contact metric structure to be K-contact, and therefore $h = 0$, ${\mathcal{L}_R}g = 0$, and also equation $(*)$ should still hold, hence (in components) \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X \Leftrightarrow {\nabla _m}{R^n} = - {\Phi ^n}_m \Rightarrow {\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {g_{nk}}{\Phi ^k}_m\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(**) \end{equation} On the other hand, since $\nabla$ is Levi-civita, we have \begin{equation} {d\kappa } \left( {X,Y} \right) = \left( {{\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m}} \right){X^m}{Y^n} = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n{X^m}{Y^n} \end{equation} and therefore ${\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m} = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n$. Now comes the final point: using the Killing vector equation ${\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {\nabla _n}{R_m}$, one obtains \begin{equation} - 2{\nabla _m}{R_n} = 2{\nabla _n}{R_m} = - {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n \end{equation} which directly contradict the equation $(**)$ So my question is 

For semiprimes, computing the Euler totient function is equivalent to factoring. Indeed, if n = pq for distinct primes p and q, then φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = pq - (p+q) + 1 = (n+1) - (p+q). Therefore, if you can compute φ(n), then you can compute p+q. However, it's then easy to solve for p and q because you know their sum and product (it's just a quadratic equation). If you believe factoring is hard for semi-primes, then so is computing the Euler totient function. Update! Factoring and computing the Euler totient function are known to be equivalent for arbitrary numbers, not just semiprimes. One reference is "Riemann's hypothesis and tests for primality" by Gary L. Miller. There, the equivalence is deterministic, but assumes a version of the Riemann hypothesis. See also section 10.4 of "A computational introduction to number theory and algebra" by Victor Shoup for a proof of probabilistic equivalence. 

Many people know that there is a (3×3) nine lemma in category theory. There is also apparently a sixteen lemma, as used in a paper on the arXiv (see page 24). There might be a twenty-five lemma, as it's mentioned satirically on Wikipedia's nine lemma page. Are the 4×4 and 5×5 lemmas true? Is there an n×n lemma? How about even more generally, if I have an infinity × infinity commutative diagram with all columns and all but one row exact, is the last row exact too? For all of these, if they are true, what are their exact statements, and if they are false, what are counterexamples? Note: There are a few possibilities for what infinity × infinity means -- e.g., it could be Z×Z indexed or N×N indexed. Also, in the N×N case, there are some possibilities on which way arrows point and which row is concluded to be exact. 

I am considering the following situation. Let $M_5$ be a 5-dimensional manifold which is an $S^1$ principal bundle over 4-manifold $M_4$. For instance, $M_5 = S^5$ and $M_4 = \mathbb{CP}^2$ with standard Hopf fibration.Now there is a principal G-bundle (or associated bundle $adP$) over $M_5$. My question is, how to characterize $P$ over $M_5$, and is there a canonical induced bundle over $M_4$? Let me explain my question a little bit. I know that, for even dimensional manifold $X$, characteristic numbers (integrating over $X$ the characteristic class built up by curvature) can efficiently characterize principal. But in odd dimensional cases, I'm not sure how to do similar thing. One thing I can imagine is to integrate characteristic classes over all even-dimensional cycles. Secondly, suppose there is a way to characterize $P\to M_5$. Then I would like to know if there is a natural principal induced bundle $P'$ over $M_4$, and how to use the data of $P\to M_5$ to describe the induced bundle $P' \to M_4$. If possible, we can take some simple cases. Say, the Hopf fibration. Principal $G$-bundles over $S^5$ are characterized by $\pi_4G$, and they are $0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as I check a list of homotopy group for Lie groups. If I take trivial $G$-bundle over $S^5$, do I get a trivial bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (do I get new "twist" in the process of inducing bundle)? And what about other situation? Thanks. 

I can't tell if that quote implies that both conditional and randomized polynomial-time algorithms exist, but it might (the exception that proves the rule?). Thanks in advance. 

Shall we try teamwork? Please feel free to edit this post if you have simplifications. The original sum may be re-expressed as $$ \frac{1}{2^{2m+1}} \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \binom{m}{k} \binom{2(k+m)}{k+m} \frac{1}{2^{2k}} \sum_{j=0}^{k+m-1} \frac{2^{k+m-j}}{(k+m-j) \binom{2(k+m-j)}{k+m-j}}. $$ If we're trying to prove this is 0, we may drop the fraction out front. Also, change variables from $j$ to $\ell=k+m-j$: $$ \sum_{k=0}^m \left( -\frac14 \right)^k \binom{m}{k} \binom{2(k+m)}{k+m} \sum_{\ell=1}^{k+m} \frac{2^\ell}{\ell \binom{2\ell}{\ell}}. $$ At this point, my idea was to change the order of summation based on $$ \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{\ell=1}^{k+m} \Diamond = \sum_{\ell=1}^m \sum_{k=0}^m \Diamond + \sum_{\ell=m+1}^{2m} \sum_{k=\ell-m}^m \Diamond, $$ but I can't get quite it to work out. The first sum simplifies, but the second sum I can't do much with. Any ideas? 

Recall that a category C is small if the class of its morphisms is a set; otherwise, it is large. One of many examples of a large category is Set, for Russell's paradox reasons. A category C is locally small if the class of morphisms between any two of its objects is a set. Of course, a small category is necessarily locally small. The converse is not true, as Set is a counterexample. Now, I can construct categories that are not locally small. However, what's the most common or most reasonable such category? 

Suppose $\kappa$ is a no-where vanishing 1-form, then its kernel is integrable is equivalent to condition $d\kappa \wedge \kappa = 0$. My question is, can such foliation smoothly deformed such that actually $d\kappa = 0$? EDIT: Smooth means real $C^\infty$, and I want the $\kappa$ to be nowhere-vanishing along the deformation. Thanks Loïc Teyssier pointing out the lack of context. Thank you. 

========Update:======== Let me ask a enhanced version of question. Suppose the (1,0)+(0,1) decomposition induced by the almost contact structure satisfies the conditions (for some $Z^{1,0}$ and $Z'^{1,0}$ ) \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right] = {Z^{1,0}} - d\kappa \left( {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right)R, \end{equation} \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},R} \right] = {Z'^{1,0}} - \left( {...} \right)R, \end{equation} 

Let $M$ be a compact contact manifold with $R$ the Reeb vector field. Let $E$ be some vector bundle of gauge group $G$, say, $G = SU(2)$ and $E$ is the adjoint vector bundle. So my question is: If $\sigma$ is a global section, can I perform a gauge transformation (select a new trivialization) such that the transformed $\sigma$ satisfies $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$? To me the answer should be positive, since I can always adjust the basis so that the condition is satisfied, but I'm not sure. Edit: Here $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is understood as $\mathcal{L}_R\sigma_i = 0$ where $\sigma = \sigma_i e_i$ with $e_i$ a local basis in every trivializing patch. $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is not a geometric relation, but more like a gauge-fixing condition. 

The ability to embed mathematical problems into chess (like combinatorial game theory into go) should not be underestimated. Papers by Richard Stanley and Noam Elkies demonstrate problems where the objective is to determine the number of ways to perform a given task. They include problems where the answer is 

Another term that has been used is "unilateral" or "unilaterally connected". I don't have a particularly strong opinion in favor of this terminology, but I am slightly opposed to just calling it "connected". (I usually assume "connected" means "weakly connected" for digraphs.) However, I must admit a reference by Tutte is good. Some references for "unilateral": 

What tournaments can be obtained this way? Of course, if $k = 1$, only linearly ordered tournaments are possible. I am most interested in the case of small $k$. For example, is there an excluded-substructure characterization of these tournaments? What if we make the problem harder and ask whether a given directed graph $G$ can be extended to a tournament $T$ such that $T$ can be obtained in this way? Again, if $k = 1$, there are various simple characterizations, such as all digraphs that contain no directed cycles. What can be said about the computational problem of determining the smallest $k$ that can represent a given tournament or digraph? 

My goal to write down an explicit (and simplest) contact metric structure on squashed $S_\omega^{2n + 1}$ defined as \begin{equation} S_\omega ^{2n + 1} = \left\{ {\left( {{z_i}} \right) \in \mathbb{C}^{n + 1}\;\;|\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n + 1} {\omega _i^2{{\left| {{z_i}} \right|}^2} = 1} } \right\} \end{equation} For the contact 1-form I would use the natural one restricted on $S^{2n+1}_\omega$ \begin{equation} \kappa \equiv \frac{i}{2}\sum\limits_{i = 1} {\left( {{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i} - {{\bar z}_i}d{z_i}} \right)} \end{equation} Take $n = 2$ as example, I use parametrization \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{gathered} {z_1} = \omega _1^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\cos {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _1}}} \\ {z_2} = \omega _2^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\sin {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _2}}} \\ {z_3} = \omega _3^{ - 1}\cos {\rho _1}{e^{i{\varphi _3}}} \\ \end{gathered} \right. \end{equation} and if I am calculating correctly, the Reeb vector field will be \begin{equation} R = \sum\limits_i {\omega _i^2{\partial _{{\varphi _i}}}} \end{equation} which generates rotation $\left( {{z_1},{z_2},{z_2}} \right) \to \left( {{e^{i\omega _1^2\theta }}{z_1},{e^{i\omega _2^2\theta }}{z_2},{e^{i\omega _3^2\theta }}{z_2}} \right)$ (Since that $\kappa \sim zd\bar z$ has $\omega_i^{-2}$ coefficients, so $R$ will need $\omega_i^{2}$ to kill these ugly coefficients and leave some $\sin$ and $\cos$ so that $\iota_R \kappa$ to add up to 1). 

The Tricki has an innovative design. The basic format is similar to Wikipedia's, in that it's a wiki that displays math as images. However, it uses a "hiding" idea in order to provide detail at various junctures during a text. This is intended to solve a common problem in mathematics texts: what level of detail should one provide? If you provide too little, your text is unreadable; if you provide too much, it clutters the main point. The Tricki solves this problem by having sections of the text hidden, but which can be expanded to provide more detail. Thus, you can read the text and get the point, while still being able to confirm any details along the way. This seems like a very elegant solution to me. The overall organization of every article is nice, too: it begins with a quick description and prerequisites. It continues with general discussion littered with many examples and formatting that emphasizes the main points. 

I don't know if this deserves to be an answer or a comment, as it includes information you surely know. The terminology of matroid theory borrows heavily from graph theory, linear algebra, and other fields. A dependent set in a graphic matroid corresponds to a cycle in the underlying graph, so a general dependent set in a matroid is called a circuit. The length of the smallest cycle of a graph is its girth, so the same word is used for a general matroid. As you're well aware, the spark of a matrix is the girth of its corresponding vector matroid. You're correct that your notion appear to be dual to spark. The appropriate terminology here could have been "cutset", as that's the corresponding notion in a (connected) graph, but for consistency it's cogirth. The co-spark of a matrix is the cogirth of its corresponding vector matroid. A matroid is representable (ie, as a vector matroid) over a field if and only if its dual matroid is representable. Moreover, the transformation taking a representation of a vector matroid to a representation of its dual matroid is completely effective. It follows, in a sense, that studying the co-spark of a matrix is equivalent to studying the spark of another matrix. In particular, any computational hardness results for spark carry over to co-spark. It seems, then, that the notion of co-spark would be useful primary as terminology and as a way of getting a handle on things, but not actually for new ideas. Here's one paper that has explicitly looked into these sorts of things: On the (co)girth of a connected matroid.
