This question relates to the Crab nebula, the Crab Pulsar and the known concurrent supernovae event as recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. I'm wondering, I'm looking at the history of the discovery of the Crab pulsar...and I'm wondering what the reason is (or suspected to be) as to why European records show a discernible lack of observations? 

From the conditions you give, yes. Absolutely. The photon flux would simply transfer too much energy for the molecules in your body to stay fixed (the radiation would be immense). Another potential way to re-phrase this question would be: "How close could a human, without protection from any form of radiation, get to the Sun before their skin burns?" 

It is actually an asteroid. I think it just helps to promote astronomy near Hallowe'en by calling it a dead comet and releasing some pretty nice photos in which it can be likened to a skull. But yes, a dead comet has been shed of all of it's ice and gas, and is left as the rocky core. This is the quote relating to the comet you are refering to and perhaps a theory on its origins: 

I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources to understand the linear limb darkening coefficient, $u$. That is to say, how the $\theta$-dependent coefficient $u$ (or sometimes $b_{\nu}$) varies with wavelength and with stellar effective temperature. I've looked at a number of sources, such as Schwarzschild (1906), Milne (1921) and my own lecture notes and others, but nothing on this coefficient? Does anyone know where to even start looking for information of the properties of $u$? 

Bendiness = space-time curvature. And yes, it is flat (k=0) for the EdS model. Essentially it is the epoch at which only matter is thought to dominate (no contributions from radiative pressure or dark energy, $\Lambda$). It is only a model. The EdS universe is thought of as a static Universe which is expanding indefinitely. It just makes solving certain equations in Cosmology a little easier, but it was perhaps due to Einstein's stubbornness in accepting a dynamic Universe. 

Best book I have used for this topic is: An Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics by Le Blanc. Excellent book, very good introductory start into this topic. 

You can easily convert flux to luminosity and vice versa using the spherical nature of the propagation of light. The equation you need is: $$ L=4\pi D^{2}f $$ Where $f$ will be your flux, and $D$ is the distance to the object, Tau Ceti in this case. From Pijpers (2003) Tau Ceti's luminosity is $0.52\pm0.03L_{\odot}$. You should have everything you need there. $L_{\odot}$ is of course the luminosity of the Sun. 

This isn't a question so much as a request. I'm looking for an image of the Orion constalletion I could use, but I would like to have a very high resolution HD image, whereby a lot of the deep sky objects can be seen to high detail other than just the 7 hourglass stars of the belt and four corners. Would love to have perhaps the Orion nebula (Messier 42), the Horsehead Nebula (near Î¶ Orionis), the emission nebula NGC 2174, Messier 43 and Barnard's Loop. 

Hopefully this will be a quick and easy question, with a quick and easy answer, but why is it that we observe a perigee Moon coincident with a full Moon approximately every 13 months? Is this related to the Earth-Moon dynamics, perhaps the eccentricity of the lunar orbit? 

Frustratingly, I find this could be a very simplistic question and may leave me feeling a little stupid for asking it. But I have to ask this. My lecturer keeps refering to "matter distributions" for various rotation cases, e.g., Keplerian rotation, solid body rotation, flat rotation etc etc. I was wondering if anyone knew exactly what this term means, or the specifics for each case? 

Useful formulations which have taken some time to dig out: $G\sim{4.3\times{10^{-6}}}\,\mathrm{kpc}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}\,\mathrm{km}^{2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ or $G\sim{4.3\times{10^{-3}}}\,\mathrm{pc}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}\,\mathrm{km}^{2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ 

I think at our current stage of solar system evolution, because of the fact that we have been able to evolve to our current level of sophistication, it could be considered to be very stable and in a very calm period in its evolutionary history. Unstable objects usually will be flung out very early on in the formation of such a system, hence why we do not see them today. However, just look at the Earth-Moon evolutionary history. It is theorised that our current Moon was captured due to a collision between Earth and perhaps a Mars (or similar size) object. This is anything but stable. The reason why, is of course, related to gravity. Or more correctly, the gravitational potential of the system. All systems want to thermalise (in the same sense that a room of air molecules want to reach a thermal equilbirium). Although our solar system is anything but thermalised, it is constantly working to achieve this. Hence, why, at our present state of the solar system's evolution, we seem like we are in a fairly calm state. At this state, to go into more depth, we can employ Bertrand's theorem which tells us that for a central potential with an $r^{-1}$ dependance on radial distance the orbits will be stable. The stability of orbits in three spatial dimensions is due to the fact that the gravitational potential decreases with distance $r$ as $r^{-1}$. 

As the commenter states, $e$ is indeed called the orbital eccentricity. If you add a radial scale length (e.g., semi-major axis) to both of those values the $1-e$ describes the periapsis (closest approach of orbit) and the $1+e$ apoapsis (furthest) of an elliptical orbit. They don't have a specific special name, as they are dimensionless measures, but can be quite useful in determining the orbit of planets and other Keplerian systems. Periapsis: $$ r_{p}=a(1-e) $$ Apoapsis: $$ r_{a}=a(1+e) $$ Perhaps the could be named the maximum radial eccentricity and minimum radial eccentricity, if you needed to describe these parameters in a report or class homework etc. 

Very quick and simple one today. What would be the best/optimal pinhole size for a pinhole projector to observe the transit of Mercury on May 9th? I want to get the optimum between resolution and brightness...has anyone any experience in this area?
