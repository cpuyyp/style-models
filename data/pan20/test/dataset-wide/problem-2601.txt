In response to your question, may I ask what are we saving ourselves from? Samsara is an endless (and beginningless) grinding cycle where all beings are being agonized by myriad forms of suffering (Dukkha). However, Samsara, and even higher realms of existence are illusionary, how can one be saved from an illusion? Here is an excellent analogy I read from the esoteric master Huang Nian-Zu: what is the best way to save a man being hunted by a vicious tiger in a nightmare? The answer isn't trying to run away or defending yourself. The best solution is to simply wake up and end the dream. Our true self has always been safe asleep, and the tiger can not harm us. In theory, the above sounds like a really simple solution. In reality, though, the difficulty to achieve this is parallel to the depth of one's delusion and attachment. Every being is one with Buddha. We are all capable and deserve the perfect wisdom, fortuity and abilities that Buddha possess. To seek help from Buddha and Bodhisattvas we need to awaken the Buddha within ourselves. Hope this helps. If there is anything I could improve on with my reply please kindly share your views :) 

I hope the above has been helpful. I must be honest to say that I am not the expert in global affairs, but I can act on what I know and try to be a better human being. Any feedback to my reply above would be very much appreciated. 

I applaud your effort to ask this matter so candidly. I have not read a Buddhist story that directly discusses the matter of masturbation but, as a Chinese Buddhist, there are many Chinese influences/wisdom, that we also study as electives, that discusses the matter of masturbation. Chinese Buddhists often build our foundation with some aspects in Confucianism and Daoism, before diving into Mahayana. Historically many Buddhist masters are not only expert in Buddhism, but often are highly educated in Confucianist and Daoist scripture and skills. The matter of masturbation and sexuality in general are often discussed in the context of Chinese medicine, which is a Daoist influence (I often think of Daoists as ancient Chinese scientists and engineers). Chinese medicine consider masturbation highly detrimental to one's health, and people should refrain from frequent sexual conduct to conserve more energy. Whilst most modern medicine I encountered asserts masturbation is harmless, as the only vital material that is lost from the human body is protein and nutrients, which easily regenerates over time. Chinese medicine speculates beyond matter (i.e. semen), understands the world is composed of matter, energy, and information, and with each ejaculation a lot of energy is lost, which does most damage to the kidneys. For men aged between 30 ~ 40, this energy cycle takes about 2 weeks to replenish, and as we get older the cycle takes even longer. Chinese medicine highly recommend men to completely abstain after the age of 60, if you wish to enjoy longevity. In short, don't do it, it's good for your health. Masturbation is also considered unwholesome sexual conduct. Confucianism teaches filial piety as the top priority of being a virtuous person. Our bodies are born from our mothers, through months of labor and hardship through birth, and then nourished and nurtured carefully by our parents. Therefore, Confucianism considers looking after our health as an essential component of filial piety. Not only is masturbation an unhealthy act, but it is also a shameful scene to behold if one were to be accidentally exposed to the public. Based on the above, I do believe masturbation is a great hinderance towards samadhi. Lastly, like any worldly attachments, I believe such an addiction can be resolved by practicing Buddhism diligently. Meditation does wonders. I have a Hare Krisna friend whom, after practicing meditation, naturally lost interest in meat and became a vegan with ease. There are many ways and teachings in the Buddhist scriptures so simply find a way that is most suitable for one's circumstances. One of the most recommended approach is through 'Disgusting Thoughts' (asubhānupassin), by visualizing our fleshy bodies in separate parts in high details (the brain, stomach, skin, fecal matter, blood, pus etc) and see through what our bodies are really made of. The essence of desire is emptiness and relative. A mosquito would find another mosquito sexually attractive, but another creature, e.g. us human-beings, or a dog, would have no interest. In the eyes of the Devas, even the most attractive super models are merely foul hideous apes. Please allow me to be frank (sorry everyone for the TMI) but, I too, had the same addiction for over 10 years. I was under the pretense it is harmless, but in retrospective, this behavior had adversed affected me psychologically. I was often shrouded with shame, I lack confidence, it warped my expectation with relationships and I could not experience satisfactory relationship. I dropped the habit 'magically' after a few weeks practicing Buddhism. I have always admired and respected Buddhism, and when I first started to study it seriously, many of my bad habits just naturally faded. I deleted all adult material, eat healthy, went vegetarian, and now married and become a first time dad. Sorry if the above sound a bit cliche. I'm still afflicted by lingering wandering thoughts, but at least I have not broken action precepts. I hope in time, and through diligent practice, all these anxiety will turn into Bodhi. 

As a Pureland Buddhist our core practice is 'Nian Fo' - earnestly chanting the name of Amitabha Buddha, to be 'mindful of Buddha'. The practitioner can chant just the Buddha's name "Amituofo" (in Chinese), or "Namo Amituofo" (Homage to Amitabha Buddha, the Shin Buddhists chant "Namu Amida Butsu"), chant repetitively with great clarity and concentration, thus blocking any possibility of wandering thoughts, or even transforming wandering thoughts into 'Amituofo'. In Mahāvaipulya mahāsamghāta sūtra, Buddha said that chanting the Buddha's name is the highest, deepest and most wonderful of Jhana (In Chinese,《大集經》曰：若人但念阿彌陀，是即無上深妙禪也。). The 13th Patriarch of Pureland Buddhist, Venerable Master Yin Guang (1862 - 1940), has reiterated the importance of Nian-Fo, and written detailed instructions the 'Ten Chants Method'（十念法）, each chant first voiced from the heart, then spoken with clarity, counted (from 1 to 10 and repeat), and clearly heard with the ears. One should also refrain from using chanting beads, to avoid bodily distraction. By doing so, 4 of the 6 senses are focused on Buddha, and with eyes gently closed all senses are able to focus on chanting. Pureland and precept are practiced in all schools in Chinese Buddhism, and during the last 10,000 years of Buddha's influence it is one of the surest approach to attain enlightenment. Practicing meditation in today's world is highly challenging. Today's society demands a lot more from us, our duties have grown in complexity, and information is booming at an incredible rate. We have to learn and fulfill complex tasks like mortgages, tax systems, beauracracies, insurance policies, and many many more. The more we multi-task the more challenging it is for us to find time to meditate and practice. Without uninterrupted time, how can we expect to focus and penetrate through the eternal cycle of Samsara? If we're not careful, we could spend our entire lifetime and not even come close to Sotapanna. Venerable Master Yin Guang emphasized on the importance of fulfilling our duties, and whenever we have time, we can chant, voiced or silently with our minds depending on the environment we are in. I chose to practice Pureland because I find it is the most suitable for my circumstances. It is convenient and, as described in many Buddhist scriptures, the merit is unimaginably wonderful. 

I am going to try my reply, based on the assumption that by 'terrorists' you are referring to the recent events in Middle East, 'Sydney Siege', Charlie Hebdo and so forth. Personally I would take the following approach: Ensure my own 'safety' first By 'safety' I mean to ensure I do not lose my own Metta. Within the eternal tides of Samsara, the wellness of my current physical body can not compare to my heart's purity. Terrorists attacks mainly originates from the hatred poison, and I must ensure I do not have delusions of justice which can subject myself to the same contamination. In reality, I am a commoner with no political influence on international affairs. Therefore, as a son, father and husband, I am obliged to ensure my, and my families', safety so I can continue to fulfil my duties. I shall remain respectful to all parties, and always keep a graceful distance. Repent my own poisons Upon witnessing the aftermath of much hatred build-up, I shall reflect within myself, "am I still poisoned with the same or similar traces of hatred? if so, can I let go of them? if not, then I shall continue to diligently abstain from hatred." Offer my merits to them Buddhism teaches that we are one with every being in all realms. We all share the same essence, and the existence of 'me' and 'them' is an illusion. Everyone in the cosmos is like the trillions of microscopic cells in a human body. When a body part is malfunctioning, the body proceeds to repair it, not avenge it. For example, if my teeth accidentally bites my tongue, would my tongue exact revenge on my teeth? If differently body parts start to turn against each other, the violence multiplies and we will all eventually perish together. There is an African village that doesn't punish fellow villagers whom has committed misconduct. They consider 'bad people' are simply unfortunately confused, so they would band together, and sing and dance around the 'bad person'. They would sing to praise nice things about him, and remind him that he should return to being the wonderful person he has always been. We may need to stay vigilant in the short term to protect our safety, but in spirit we must be mindful that anyone is capable of greatness, everyone can attain Buddha-hood, and work towards that goal. As a Pureland Buddhist myself, I would ask Amitabha Buddha to help us and dedicate merits to the situation at the end of every practice. Proper education As a Chinese Buddhist I practise Confucian virtues as a core foundation before diving into Mahayana wisdom. An essential part of Chinese Buddhism (and Chinese culture, in general) is cultivating filial piety. By fulfilling our filial duties we focus our life on full and proper care for our parents, our first and most important benefactors, and then gradually expand that love to our direct family members, friends, community and, with Mahayana teaching, expand the love to all realms. The confucian book 'Di Zi Gui' (sometimes known as 'Pupil's Guide') summarizes criteria of filial piety into 7 parts: filial to elders, care for juniors, exercise caution, trustworthiness, love all beings, get well acquainted with the wise, and study arts (e.g. literature, skills, music etc) once the former criteria have been well established. This is commonly thought to be taught to children, but has been highly encouraged for adults to practice and 'fill in the gaps'. After all, how can you be Buddha, if you can't even succeed at being a human being? If we can promote education towards love and wisdom (Metta), then we can cultivate better empathy for others and work together to foster happier families, and better communities. The most efficient way to convince others is not to approach them, but to first practice Metta diligently, set a great example, and convince others with our actions.
