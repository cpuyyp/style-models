Nuts: walnuts? I'm thinking pre-shelled walnut halves (walnust halves may/should be fresher than chopped walnuts). There are about 30 calories per whole walnut, or 185 per ounce (contrast with 96 calories per ounce of sugar): because it's from fat. 

Something that can help is called your "stroke". A novice is inclined to push straight down on the pedal ... and then, straight down on the other pedal ... so that you're pushing down, and then pushing down. A more experienced rider has a more continuous "cycle": 

... which implies that cycling performance is affected by one's age. Now ageing might be, to quote the FAQ, "an actual problem that you face". Assuming that ageing is in fact some kind of 'problem', can you tell me what's useful to know about it? Especially as it relates to cycling (ability, performance, expectations, and/or training)? For example a little bit of googling found "Key found to muscle loss as we age" which suggests that one cause of muscle wasting in older people is decreased blood flow to the legs (which cycling presumably helps to counter-act somewhat). To be a bit more specific: 

For packing, a box from a bike shop will do fine and you can chuck it in the recycling when you get to Tokyo and find another before flying out. Most bike shops will give these to you if you ask nicely and even if they charge you, it ain't going to be much. A much bigger issue is airline choice. Options for flying with a bike range from free to pay by the kilo in excess charges to some obscene special bike charge. Read up and check the baggage allowances for sporting goods very carefully. If you fly a lot, get a loyalty card, the extra 10kg you get on most airlines' lowest tier covers a bike in a box nicely. And if you get some special luggage tags, that can't hurt either. My bike has survived a few flights totally unharmed, this was in a bike box though. Though I do have friends who have shipped a lot of bikes all over the place in cardboard and I've never heard of any problems. Not that it can't happen, it's just unlikely. You can't move for bikes/bike shops in Tokyo so getting spares isn't going to be an issue. Getting your bike stolen is not going to happen. Walking out of the secure side of an airport with a bike up your jumper is going to raise eyebrows. 

That's in answer to my, "In my personal experience no dog has ever attacked any human". Conversely, I've heard anecdotes from people who are afraid of dogs. In fact there was one lady who I met for the first time, and among the first things she and her husband said was that she was afraid of dogs. The next morning all four of us were walking (on a wide footpath in a nature reserve around a lake), more of less line abreast. An unleashed dog showed up on the path ahead, coming towards us, and she ducked behind her husband: at which the damn dog made a bee-line straight for her, frightening her (and so us) more. 

Edit: Someone mentioned that some helmets come with visors, which can interfere with your visibility when you're in a "heads down" position. Now I recall, I did notice some with a visor, often a detachable visor, and reflexively (note that I'm a novice buyer/user, not an expert/salesman) avoided them: I reckoned that instead of a visor I could wear sunglasses instead, if it came to that. 

Bad disc brake performance is almost always either air in the lines or oil on the pads. Air makes the levers spongey and oil stops the pads grabbing the disc. Your problem sounds like air, a bleed should sort it out. A bad bleed from the factory is not that uncommon. If you've patience you can try turning the bike so the line is as vertical as possible and gently tap the calliper, line and lever to see if you can convince the bubble into the reservoir, this is a temporary fix but will confirm that the problem is air. An oily pad will feel firm if you pull the lever but will not grab the disc when you're riding. They often feel just fine if you push the bike with no weight on it. To test this you could pull out the front pads and see if they work better, be sure the clean the disc with some alcohol first. The easiest way to fix dirty pads is to buy new ones. Brakes that are not run in properly feel like oily ones, just not to the same extent, and are easily fixed by following the run in procedure in your manual. This is usually getting up to speed and stopping as hard as you can 5 or 10 times. 

This little article on skid stops implies you're strong enough to skid your rear wheel: especially if you're bouncing; and perhaps even more so if your bike has gears. Are you wearing shoes which clip to pedals? Perhaps (I don't know) you should concentrate on 'spinning' in a circular way (pushing forward and down, pulling back and up), instead of just thumping in one direction on the down-stroke. 

"He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me." Those who harbor such thoughts do not still their hatred. "He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me." Those who do not harbor such thoughts still their hatred. Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world. By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased. This is a law eternal. There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels. 

I've just had a quick read of the BB7 / 5 service manual. The only reference to not using barrel adjusters is for pad wear on page 11. Mechanical disc brakes have a pad wear adjustment, usually on the outboard side of the calliper. This should be used to account for pad wear and not the barrel adjuster. 

After cleaning I give the bolts a small squirt of WD40 followed by a good rub down. This leaves a very fine film of oil that won't hold dirt but is just enough to stave off the rust if done regularly. The spray also displaces (WD, water displacement, geddit?) any water left from cleaning in any little gaps. 

Did you push the pistons back into the callipers? Hydraulic brakes automatically adjust for pad wear and the home position of the pistons moves slightly out. When you change pads you need to gently push the pistons back in gently with something like a plastic tire lever to return the fluid to the reservoir, then pump the lever to set the correct level of adjustment for the new pads. 

Even if you can't "find soy everywhere", other legumes/pulses too are sources of protein (Wikipedia says they're nicknamed "vegetarian's meat"): including beans (of all kinds), peas, lentils, chick-peas, peanuts. Dried beans/lentils might therefore be worth considering: light-weight (because they're dried) and don't need refridgeration. Also, nuts (but these are more expensive, and fatty/high calorie). [I don't tour, so I'm not speaking from experience of touring; though I am vegetarian.] 

Cars routinely slow down behind tractors when they go up that hill; but when I was driving (a car) I was surprised to see a cyclist hugging the verge as if there was enough room for me to overtake him safely (I didn't think there was and so I didn't). Also, is there any legally-required overtaking margin (for example, "cars must leave a gap of one metre (3 feet) when overtaking a cyclist")? FWIW I understand there is strict liability law in France, which may help, nevertheless I'd like to do whatever it is I should. 

You're mixing up two different concepts. The damper, which is what slows things down. The spring, which is what holds the weight and absorbs shocks. The damper is usually hydraulic, oil being forced through a small hole. The spring is either a coil or pressurised air. Without a damper, you'll have a very bouncy ride and without a spring, you'll have a very stiff ride. The 2 work together to provide a nice ride. Also, those 2 bikes target different styles of riding. The Slash is an Enduro bike and the Voltage a Freeride bike. 

You could try wiping the grease in the stem off with some alcohol or thinners. Even a little bit in there could be a problem. I'd leave cheater bar alone and try and get them snug without using it. Stems aren't something you want to fail suddenly. Have you checked the dimensions of the bar and stem? 

And what might have caused the tyre to slide? When braking, push your weight as far back as possible. When emergency-braking, standing on the pedals (easier with bike shoes attached to the pedals), you might even stick your bum behind (off the back of) the saddle. That maximizes your weight over the back wheel. It also puts your weight low and away from the front (not high and near the front), and your arms pointing forward instead of pointing down, so you're less likely to flip over the front. Slow down. After falling you may be more careful in future. I slipped (and fell) recently on a little mud in an otherwise dry path, which reminded me that mud is much more slippery than a dry surface. Brake with both brakes (front and back) at the same time. Weight is pushed onto the front wheel (by deceleration), and friction is proportional to weight (no weight implies no friction): so if you brake equally on both wheels, your first warning that you're braking too hard is that your unweighted back wheel starts to skid (at which point you start to fish-tail, but might not fall off ... I think the point of no return is if the front wheel starts to skid). This (the back wheel skidding) is early warning that you're braking too much and are near to skidding the front, at which point you ease off slightly on both brakes. disc brakes, would overheat and the rotor would be destroyed I don't know whether that's possible? I've heard of people bursting their tires by overheating with rim brakes. I don't know about the rotor but maybe it is possible to glaze the brake pads by overheating: and maybe that depends on what the pads are made of (e.g. whether they're "organic" or "sintered"). 

The short answer? No. Threaded GXP uses the Hollowtech II style dimples for tightening, these aren't deep enough for a C-Spanner style or for a wrench the has less than 180 degrees of contact. Even if a tool existed, most chainrings are going to get in the way, my 1X is GXP and there's not a lot of room, a double or triple is going to make this worse. And finally, GXP works by clamping the non-driveside bearing between a flange on the spindle and the back of the crank arm. There's no preload adjustment, so tighten it down and leave it alone. PS. What style is your eccentric BB? 

At the absolute minimum you should be able to replace just the freehub body. Some Googling should turn up some compatible options. The plot thickens, this hub seems to use a different freehub style to most other Shimanos. This would work with the majority of clickity hubs, but Sheldon says the silent ones are different. The freehub body is the dark grey splined part of the hub that turns. If you remove the axel and bearings you can pop this off with a large allen key, I forget the size, 8 or 10mm. Getting it all back together can be a pain, the freehub's easy, but the first time you set cup and cone bearings yourself will make you curse. The next option up, is to replace the hub with one that already has the freehub you want and get someone to relace your wheel. Then a whole new rear wheel, then a new bike. These options go from most to least work and least to most cash. 

So you adjust your tire pressure to match the road condition, for example depending on whether you expect to risk ice that day. I haven't tried that, but it sounds clever and correct. 

I suspect that a few people want to have bikes without buying them: and create and maintain Frankenbikes using 'found' and 'spare' parts. 

More on the GORE-TEXT web site. A jacket's performance depends partly on how its made (e.g. mine has a mesh lining inside which keeps it away from the skin, helps ventilation). It wasn't especially cheap; but I've had it for maybe 15 years now and it seems to me good as new (though unfortunately that brand isn't made/sold anymore). For what it's worth and for example, Amazon UK are selling Paclite jackets for GBP90..120. If it were me I'd want to try one on before I bought it. You might also find clothes discounted/on sale sometimes.
