Hi Mathoverflow. This question is about building intuition for the Proj construction. When I first started learning about schemes, I found the construction of the structure sheaves on Spec and Proj very confusing. However, after enough time had passed I began to understand the construction for Spec: It is sort of an algebraic partition of unity argument. The construction of the structure sheaf on Proj is still very mysterious to me. For completeness it goes something like this: 

Let $\lambda$ be a partition with $\leq n$ rows and let $L_{\lambda}$ be the corresponding irreducible representation of ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. Let $e_m(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ be the $m$th elementary symmetric polynomial. Is there a known formula for the element $c_m \in Z(U(\mathfrak{gl}_n))$ which acts on $L_{\lambda}$ by the scalar $e_m(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$? It is easy to check that $c_1 = E_{11} + \dots + E_{nn}$, so I suspect that $c_m$ should be related to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. Also, I am aware of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, but have not been able to use it to produce a formula. I would be particularly interested in references where this is worked out. I couldn't find it in any of the standard representation theory text books. 

If $f: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_{2g+2}$ is a general family of hyperelliptic curves (defined over $\mathbb{C}$), we know that the algebraic connected monodromy group $Mon^{0}$ of this family is equal to the full symplectic group. Now if we have a 1-parameter family of hyperelliptic curves given for example by the expression $y^{2}= (x-h_{1}(t))....(x-h_{2g+2}(t))$ where $t$ is the parameter in $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ and the $h_{i}$ are holomorphic functions in $t$, is the group $Mon^{0}$ of this family also equal to the full symplectic group $Sp_{2g+2}$? if not, how can one compute the monodromy group of such family? 

Let $X$ be a compact Shimura curve. If we remove finitely many points from this curve, do we neccessarily get a "non-compact Shimura curve"? I have some reasons to believe that the answer is negative, but don't have a proof nor a counter example. However if the answer is really No, does there exist a well-known structure / property for this punctured Shimura curve? 

On the wikipedia page for Calabi–Yau manifolds there is a picture. I want to learn how to make pictures like this. They claim that it is a hyperplane section of a quintic three-fold but whenever I use computer software to visualize the real points of such a hyperplane section it always looks really boring. 

Let $M$ be a manifold and $\pi : E \to M$ a rank $n$ vector bundle on $M$. We can define a connection on $E$ in two ways: 

I understand the intuition behind this result: Since the open sets are so big, the scheme $$ \varprojlim_{p \in U\subseteq X \; \text{open}} U $$ captures a lot of infomation about $X$ at the point $p$. I can imagine a proof which goes like this: We can assume without loss of generality that the varieties in question are affine. Therefore we are reduced to proving that an isomorphism $ R_{\mathfrak{p}} \to S_{\mathfrak{q}}$ of rings induces an isomorphism $ R_f \to S_g$ for suitable elements $f \notin \mathfrak{p} $ and $ g \notin \mathfrak{q} $. This approach is a bit disappointing in my opinion because the result is so geometric and we reduce it to a formal proof about localization. 

In the literature, in many places the computations of Cohomology of the affine singular and projective smooth models are done interchangeably. Let us work with curves. For example, if $\pi:Y\to \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of the $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, then $Y$ is projective and smooth but in in practical cohomological computations the affine singular model $X$ defined by the equation $X:=\{y^l=\prod (x-a_k)^{d_k}\}$ is used. Of course $Y$ is the normalization of $X$ and I know that $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\cong H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. But for example when the curve is defined over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$ and you compute the Hasse-Witt matrix $F:H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ how can one still use the basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ and computations be in terms of $a_k$ and $d_k$ above (which come from $X$)? The precise example that I have in mind is the following: (Taken from the paper I. Bouw, The p-rank of ramified covers of curves. Compositio Math. 126 (2001), 295–322.). The standard way of computing the above Hasse-Witt matrix is to decompose the cohomology $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ in to eigenspaces $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ of the natural $\mathbb{Z}/l \mathbb{Z}$-action for $1\leq i\leq l-1$. Then a basis for $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ is computed by taking two open sets $V_1=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \infty)$ and $V_2=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \{0\})$. Then $\Gamma(V_1,\mathcal{O}_{V_1})=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1} k[x]v_i$ where $v_i=y^i \prod (x-a_k)^{-[id_k/l]}$. My problem/question is: $v_i$ is only a rational section (not regular) and on $X$ (not $Y$) so how can it be viewed as a regular section? If you pull it back to $Y$ to become a regular function, then first of all the equation of $v_i$ certainly changes and secondly, how come that the resulting matrix $F$ is still the same, although we are using a basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (instead of $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$)? (Because if $F:V\to V$ and you change the basis, of course the matrix of $F$ changes too!) 

Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space such that $\mu(X) < \infty$. We say that two measurable sets $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if $\mu (A \Delta B) = 0$. The equation $$ d(A,B) = \mu (A \Delta B)$$ defines a metric on $\mathcal{A}$ modulo equivalence. 

Here is my idea for how a proof might go: If $f : M \to N $ is a surjective map of smooth manifolds, then ${\rm Null} \; f'(m) \leq b $ defines an open subset of $M$. Somehow relate this nullspace to the fiber dimension in the complex manifold case. I have no idea if this will work... 

It is easy to check that $L$ satisfies the pumping lemma for context free languages. My instincts tell me that it shouldn't be context free because you can only add square brackets (which correspond to dashed edges) in certain contexts, but I don't know if this intuition can be turned into a proof. 

If $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ and thus with the (affine) formula $y^{m}= (x_{1}-a_{1})^{t_{1}}....(x_{n}-a_{n})^{t_{n}}$ there is a Galois group decomposition on the cohomolgy $H^{1}(C, \mathbb{C})$ (or more generally on the sheaf $R^{1} \pi_{*} \mathbb{C}$ ) and the dimension of the eigenspace with respect to the character $j \in \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by the formula $-1+ \sum_{i=1}^n < jt_{i}/m> $ (where $< x>$ denotes the franctional part of the number $x$ ) . Now if the Galois group of the covering $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is not cyclic, is there a formula that computes the dimension of the eigenspaces? Or generally how can one compute the dimension of the eigenspaces? For simplicity you can always assume that the covering $\pi$ is abelian (i.e. the Galois group is abelian) and thereof the fiber product of cyclic covers. 

I have been learning some representation theory and have some questions about the following pattern: Instance 1: If we have a finite group $G$ and a field $k$, a representation of $G$ over $k$ consists of a finite dimensional $k$-vector space $V$ and a homomorphism $G \to GL(V)$. We have a Hopf algebra $kG$ and an equivalence between representations of $G$ over $k$ and finite dimensional $kG$-modules. Instance 2: If we have a Lie group $G$, a representation of $G$ consists of a finite dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space $V$ and a smooth homomorphism $ G \to GL(V) $. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the lie algebra of $G$. Then we have a Hopf algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ and an equivalence between representations of $G$ and finite dimensional $U(\mathfrak{g})$-modules. 

I am trying to understand the Segal-Sugawara construction from the book "vertex algebras and algebraic curves" by Frenkel, Ben-Zvi in 3.4.8. As an absolute layman in the area of mathematical physics and vertex algebras, I have difficulties to understand the arguments there, as it seems many details in the proof have been omitted. More concretely, the computations of $S_n.J^{b}_{-1}v_k$ for $n=-1,0,1$ are still obscure for me. Could anyone explain these computations with more details? 

If $f: X \rightarrow C$ is the universal family of false elliptic curves (i.e. abelian surfaces $A$ such that $End(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a totally indefinite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$), then $C$ is a Shimura curve. My question is : How does the the variation of Hodge structures(VHS) of this universal family look like? Of course I know that for any family of abelian varieties over a Shimura curve, the VHS has the form $R^{1}f_{*}\mathbb{C}= (\mathbb{L} \otimes \mathbb{T}) \bigoplus \mathbb{U}$ where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are unitary and $\mathbb{L}$ is uniformizing, but I want a more specific description in the case of a universal family of false elliptic curves. 

Most books on commutative algebra explain Grobner bases in the non graded case and minimal free resolutions in the local case. I like projective geometry and want to compute the minimal free resolution of a coherent sheaf on projective space. What follows is my understanding of how this should work, along with some points at which I am confused: We are given a coherent sheaf $ \mathscr{F}$ on $ \mathbb{P}^n$ via generators and relations. That is, we have an exact sequence $$ \oplus \mathscr{O}(-b^2_{p}) \to \oplus \mathscr{O}(-b^1_{p}) \to \mathscr{F} \to 0 $$ with $ b^2_{p} \geq b^1_{q} $ for each $ p,q$. The first map in this sequence is given by a matrix $ (F_{ij})$ of homogeneous polynomials such that $ F_{ij}$ has degree $ b^2_j - b^1_i$. For the resolution which we are going to compute to be minimal we want $b_p^2 > b^1_q$ for each $p,q$. This brings us to our first question:
