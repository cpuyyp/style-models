Fundamentals of the self Given that artificial bodies and full immersion simulation is the norm, you seem to have a society like Ghost in the Shell wherein the difference between virtual and actual experiences blur together. Specifically I would direct you to the Stand Alone Complex anime (if you haven't already watched it), as it touches a wide range of the same social issues. If the brain is a normal human brain, and it receives the same set of inputs when experiencing the real world through an entirely artificial shell as when it experiences the virtual world, then it stands to reason that many people may ask what the difference is. Many may even choose to forgo the use of an artificial body completely, as the maintainance costs may be prohibitive. Compare this with the cost of owning a car: 

Little brainettes However, underlying all of this is a fundamental question that I have avoided so far: is the human race procreating? And if so, how? If not, then are the AIs we create our offspring? Where do little brains come from, and what happens to rest of the body if they are cultivated in the usual way? If brains come from humans that are grown the usual way, then you are left with the remains of that persons body as hazardous waste once the brain and spine has been removed. Taking care of that may be an extremely unpleasant job, and may thus a thankless, mentally scarring job (at the opposite end of an elite job). If brains are grown without the rest of the body, then that raises a whole lot of questions of it's own. However we can then safely say that the field of human medicin that is worth studying would be greatly diminished, thus the workload of medical students would be greatly changed. In this world, much of the mdical field concerned with the body has been supplemented or replaced with technical knowledge from other fields. (Sorry about the lack of references, unfortunately I'm not allowed more than two since I'm new. The question leaves a lot of free variables, which is why I've included a bunch of questions to consider while world-building.) 

Humans would find a way to compensate. Take your airplanes example - why would airplanes have to be limited to wood? What about composites? Wood can easily lead, through a different technology path to materials like graphite. Pona wood from the Amazon has a cross-section and properties that are practically identical to graphite. And there are plenty of other metals that are ductile enough to make wire, but even without wiring, I can see technology going down a different path. Rather than transmitting electricity, what about skipping the whole electrical network technology, and going right to self contained devices that require no flexible wiring. Electricity and magnetism are such ubiquitous, useful, and powerful forces/fields/concepts that we'd find a way to make them work. Now, take iron out of the equation and you may have something. Taking iron out would probably also take Nickel out, at least any significant deposits of it to be mined. Nickel is found, in mines, mixed with iron, likely because of the way stars and worlds form. So that takes out the two most common ferromagnetic materials. Take out the ability of an intelligent race to interact with magnetism, and you've just handed them a very intractable technological hurdle. 

On the surface, culture is basically the protocols we use to relate to each other. But the deeper truth is that those protocols are dictated by the values that lie underneath. What a culture values determines how its members relate to one another. If a person from an entirely different culture comes in, with entirely different values, sees the local behavior, at best they will not be able to make heads or tails why people behave so. At worst, they will totally misinterpret and misjudge the people and their behavior. Example 1: one of the highest values in Sawi culture was betrayal. When they were first exposed to the story of Jesus, they laughed at Jesus and considered Judas the hero. Example 2: When I saw a PNG man carrying nothing but a bush-knife, while his wife, next to him, carried nearly 100 lbs of firewood and produce, i was incensed. When I found out his traditional role of warrior forced him to be ready to fend off attackers, I thought I now understood. I was wrong. There was much more about the local history and current context that went into it. What is it that these aliens value? Can you come up with values that would really be alien to us (because even the "negatives" like betrayal have been tried by humans)? The closest I have seen was in SF is in "The Red Planet", the martians have a thing they call "the other place" to which they go sometimes. This was a truly alien and other-dimensional kind of behavior/value. The humans did not understand their doing that, and the martians did not understand humans being limited to one "place". One more very important thought: consider one of the most unbreakable codes in history - the Navajo codetalkers of WWII. Breaking a code that is a foreign language proved impossible for during WWI, so before WWII, Hitler actually sent anthropologists to the US to study native American languages. They were unable to do so. It takes years, with the cooperation of native speakers, hearing language and seeing it connected to meaning, to learn someone else's language. So a big key is for these aliens to be able to decode transmissions that include audio and video. Then sampling what language constructs go with what situations. Can be done. 

Cancer While such an accident is quite unlikely, some serious diseases only have cures that an unborn child will hardly survive. Cancer being the most obvious example. 

The question has been asked on Quora but without any detailed answers. I'm tagging this "Science-based", but any hard-science answers are preferred. 

Not plausible This cannot be done without Batman physics. Anybody who has ever climbed a rope will find it ridiculous. 

Ever tried this? If you want to offer your friend a rope to climb up on, you anchor your end first. You do not simply "hold the rope". The dynamic load on the rope when someone is climbing it will be about twice that persons weight. It might be possible if your hero finds a well braced position and wraps the rope around his waist, but even then it is a pretty desperate stunt. 

One completely different alternative (if it fits your storyline and game rules) is to make the continent accessible but worthless. That is, players can (perhaps with some difficulty) enter the area. They might get a warning "You are now entering barren uncharted territory". They cannot, however, interact with any features there. No mining, no settlements, no NPC:s or buildings present. Your future expansion might be explained (in-game) by some event that triggered colonization into this new continent. 

Must have - windshield. I have eaten beetles and ants, and believe me, it ain't no picnic. You do not want to be eating (or wearing) that many bugs on your way to a dentist appointment. Also a must have - altimeter and computer controlled altitude. The computer controlled altitude is government regulated. The computer calculates the altitude as a formula of direction (degrees from true North) and speed, to maintain safe flight altitudes so people going in the same direction and speed are all travelling at the same altitude. But hackers make a business of bypassing the regulated controls so people can do drag-races down the Grand Canyon, or the Redwood Forest or downtown New York. 

As with all things that seem impossible, like eating an elephant, the trick is to do it one bite at a time. So... Start by using your 10,000 to get yourself elected to your district's city-council seat. Hopefully you are in a small city with district rather than at-large elections, and the 10,000 is enough. Mind you, you get above 100,000 people, and the 10,000 probably won't cut it. But you also need to be sure to follow a good strategy that will take years to implement, even to just get on the council. Then start with small steps. Maybe start to encourage that the historic downtown get cordoned off for vehicles, so that people can park on the outside, and walk in. Change the roads to being for bicycles or other non-motorized transport. The city builds a parking garage right outside the cordoned off area and gets income from the parking fees. Then start growing the idea. Just growing one spot may prove undoable, as it would be difficult to grow it large enough to make mass transportation viable, before people get too leg-sore to accept the change. So grow it by building on the success. The first spot is doing so well, that we cordon off another spot, in another part of the city. Maybe create a large park area on the outside of the city - trails, outdoor amphitheater - and/or maybe your city has a river, away from the historic downtown, so you convince the council to move towards developing a river-walk a la San Antonio river-walk. Then add in mass transportation. You can start by adding it between the two spots that were pedestrian only. Can do some shopping and sight seeing in historic downtown, then zip over in the electric trolleys to the river-walk for more shopping and dinner. Then start making spots in between the two areas, in the trolley's route, also pedestrian only. Now you have mass transportation and the community starting to get used to the pedestrian-only areas, so you can start growing it more. Mind you, you'd have to be one crazy good demagogue. People are going to be incredibly reluctant and push back every step of the way. If you were someone with the charisma of an Obama or Bill Clinton (I may or may not be against disagreeing with their politics, but cannot deny their charisma), you may, one chance in a million, get the plan through. But that would make for a good story. Someone with that kind of charisma who rather than going for power, decides to simply transform his own community for the better. 

So overall it's potentially a hassle to even have a body, so if someone could offer you hosting for your brain and spine with a good connection to a general purpose informational exchange network (read Internet) where people can share a virual environment, then that may be preferable to a large group of people. For a real-world example of this, look at how many people and companies are choosing to forgo in-house hosting of web-sites and the like, instead choosing to hand hosting over to dedicated providers. Society: You, me and everybody Of course this also requires that the potential clients trusts the hosting company absolutely, since they have no way protecting or defending themselves in the real world and no way to walk away from the company if they were dissatisfied (if the company won't let them). This leads to a potentially abusive relationship: any company or organization dealing in artificial bodies or conciousness hosting (shells) would hold a lot of power over the individual. This leads to a divergence in the way you might want to handle the society: 

This affects what jobs might be available and what they entail, but since "what would elite jobs be like" is part of the question, I will assume that society operates in an hierarchical fashion and that social advancement along with accumulation of monetary wealth are core goals for the individual. Enjoying yourself is also a goal, and a part of that is meaningful occupation (at work and in your free time). Jobs in Utopia Physical labor can often be left to non-sentient, necessarily intelligent AIs manning specialized (see industrial robots) or generalized bodies. A human touch may be required if the situation is unpredictable, or if there is the need to have someone take on the responsibility in case of failure. This is assuming that there is enough robotic bodies to go around, But since "androids are running the streets" I feel that it is not unfair. More cerebral jobs would be the go-to for humans and human-level AI under this society. It brings up the further question of how to define the abilities and inadequacies of AI with human-level intelligence. This is a part where you might want to take a few liberties, since the best example of a high-profile AI with something approaching human-like intuition would be IBM's Watson. To continue talking about jobs, this also means that a huge segment of the job-market as we know it today disappears. With no "menial" or repetitive work, that only leaves creative and administrative work (e.g. I'd classify being a CEO as a comibination of creativity and administration), along with any other position that requires someone to hold responsibility. This is usually what we consider elite jobs today, so assuming that the majority of people have work like this we'd probably push the difinition to cover the upper echelons of such work: jobs with the most freedom, the most power and (possibly) the most responsibility. Some jobs that might exist: 

Is it possible, yes. Is it probable, no. Consider Genghis Khan. He started out as a peasant within a clan, watched his father killed by the warlord of an opposing clan. But he was the most successful conqueror in history. Became the warlord of his clan, united the clans more and more, and eventually formed an army and set up an empire that was pretty much unstoppable. He conquered more of the world than Alexander the Great. His empire was larger than any other empire in History. And he did this without a telepath. A telepath would help, like any other (admittedly powerful) resource or intelligence source would help. But like others have pointed out, it would not be the be-all-end-all that some might think. Just a tool. So possible, again, yes, if you are a Genghis Khan. But such men are few and far between. So, probably... not. But then again, most good stories are built on the seeing the improbable and unique and hyper-talented come to life. And this all means that whether the warlord can conquer the world or not rests a lot more on his personal genius, people management skills, and drive than on any one specific individual under his command. 

The moon's orbit is about 380 thousand kilometers from the earth. The moon is about 1/100th the mass of the earth and it's diameter is about 1/3.5 that of the earth (1/3.66... but close enough). The moon is less dense than the earth. Suppose you had a second moon twice as far out as our current moon, and say 1/2 the diameter of our moon. Say that it is the same density as our moon. It's mass would be 1/8th that of our moon just by the difference in volume, which would make it 1/800 the mass of earth. When aligned with our moon, the new moon's pull on our current moon, being at the same distance, would only be about 0.125% that of the earth. It would cause a pretty good wobble on the moon's orbit, but nothing out of the realm of possibility. Our moon is about 100 times less massive than earth, but, when aligned, would be at half the distance from this new moon. So our Moon's pull on this new moon would be about 4% that of the earth. The wobble in the orbit of the new moon would be significantly more pronounced, but again nothing that the right orbit could not account for. This new moon would be 1/8 the mass of our moon, and twice as far, making its pull on earth 1/32 that of our moon, or about 3% that of the moon. I do not think this would yield any significant atmospheric effects, but again, I am no astrophysicist. Mind you, this smaller moon's orbit would also change in speed near the alignment. As it approached alignment, it would speed up, and as it passed alignment it would slow back down. Overall, at twice the distance from earth, it would move about 1.4 times slower than our current moon. But it's angular speed, which is what we would "see" would be about 2.8 times slower than the moon (the square root of 8 for anyone who cares). Also, light intensity changes inversely proportional to the square of the distance, so at twice the distance, the same object would be 1/4 as bright, but this moon would be much smaller (1/4 the surface area) and possibly made of different material, so even if it was quite reflective, it would be somewhere near one tenth as bright. Finally, as others have said, other planets in our solar system have multiple moons. I am no astrophysicist (just a physics nut) but it would seem there is nothing to preclude your scenario. So yes, this is plausible, and the orbit would be stable. At those distances, the orbits would have some interesting characteristics, but I am fairly sure it would be something for astronomers, not very visually apparent to the average earthman observer. 

No way So, in the blue corner we have a minority, albeit a substantial one. Very well armed by civilian standards, but still restricted by current us gun laws. To be generous, we can equate each rebels firepower to an infantryman. The rebels are naturally highly motivated, given that they are in a fight-or-die situation. In the red corner we have the majority population. They outnumber the rebels. They can outspend the rebels, given that they control state and federal institutions. They massively outgun the rebels. When the rebels send a bullet, the government can return an artillery shell. And in your scenario, the regulars are brain washed and led to believe that THEY are fighting the good fight. Meaning they also are motivated. They most likely believe that the rebels are a real threat to them, to their homes, loved ones and way of life. Now, if the scenario had been a democracy (or even a dictator) at war overseas fighting local guerilla, yes the rebels would stand a fighting chance. (Historical examples are plenty). Such a guerilla does not need to beat the invader outright, they just need to deny them victory. Sooner or later the cost of war will add up, and the invader will lose interest. But in a civil war situation? Without massive outside help? Nope. The only difference your guns will make is that more of your minority group will slaughtered with guns in their hands instead of unarmed, but a slaughter it will be. 

As has been pointed out, plants can give off CO2 at night. If you pick a plant that only blooms at night, you'd have a plant that is using up much more energy at night, thus producing more CO2, and the scent of the flower could add to the insect repellent function. My mother used to grow these orchids in our home (back in my home-country) that would only bloom once every few weeks, and only at midnight and the bloom would be wilted by morning. They were so beautiful, when my mom knew they would be blooming, we'd stay up to see them. 

My first thought was what Burki mentions - biofeedback kind of thing. Read "Starship Troopers" and that is a great example of just this sort of thing. But the problem with that is that you then end up limiting the robot to the physical limitations of the pilot. If the pilot gets tired of running, and can't run anymore, the robot is stuck. Plus, how do you handle other functions like flight and firing the robot's eye-lasers? So, I would go with something different. If I remember correctly, we have something called mirror-neurons. When we imagine ourselves running, the same neurons fire in our brain that would fire when we actually run, but mirror-neurons keep the signal from actually going out to our limbs. You could have an interface (helmet? telepathic? brain implant?) a-la Avatar movie, which allows the pilot to "imagine" the actions he/she wants and the robot would do them. The interface can induce an imagine/day-dream state that allows the pilot to do everything they want to do, in their mind, without it actually translating into any motion. This allows for total control, and if the interface is sophisticated enough, control could even include flight and use of other non-human capabilities the robot may have - pilot, day-dream away.
