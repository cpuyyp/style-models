The general advice is that you should expect to prepare several different version of you resume/CV. These versions emphasize different aspects of your strengths and experience. Some jobs will require knowledge specific to the domain. They don't just need a programmer, they need somebody with knowledge of the subject. For these positions a long but edited version of your list of accomplishments would be appropriate. For some jobs that are expecting you to be very experienced with the technology or language, your math competitions should be limited to a couple of sentences. Because I am in the US I am not familiar with any of these events. You must make sure that they are presented in a way that allows you get the advantage you hope without having them just skip over the whole list after reading one or two. In other words if you won the Nobel prize make sure it isn't buried in the list. How should they be worked in? That is the tricky part. Most hiring managers don't care about your goals, or outside interests. It doesn't make a difference that somebody gardens or runs marathons. None of those things help the company make a profit. That is why if you put them in a section that they might never read, you risk getting no advantage. You will only end up taking valuable resume real estate for something they never read. If you only use it for the positions most related to math skills, you will get a better return. The hiring manager is looking for evidence, and your list of accomplishments will be just what they are looking to see. 

If reject, decide if you want to try for a counter offer. Evaluate the risk. In your case you are being told there is no way a counter offer will be accepted. Decide if you believe that advice If risk is too great, accept the offer. If you view the risk as acceptable, make a counter offer and hope for the best. 

Colleges care about SAT and ACT exams. Some scholarships care about these scores. It may be that a internship for incoming freshman care. Otherwise no, they don't want to see your SAT scores. One issue you would have if an employer wanted to know your score, is that there is no mechanism to get official scores to anyplace besides colleges and universities. If you took AP or IB exams for a particular subject and achieved high scores; it may help to mentioned that when applying for an internship to emphasize your skills in that area. I wouldn't include SAT or ACT scores on a resume. It is Ok to include information that some employers don't want to know, but it is not good to include information that no employer wants to know. 

This biggest hurdle you will have is the fact that management doesn't realize how dysfunctional these meetings are. They are locked into either a weekly meeting without a true need, or a desire to equate meetings with progress. If a manager realized that bad meetings are a waste of time, and they realized they lacked the skills/training to run a good meeting, they would either get that training or turn to somebody for help. Lacking this awareness you risk that any attempt to address the situation by skipping meetings or trying to have stealthy meetings can be seen as insubordination. These meetings tend to either be void of an agenda or have such a skimpy one that it is worthless. A typical agenda I see is (start time, stop time, last weeks activities, this weeks activities, next weeks activities; or old business, new business) You need to start small: propose to run a single meeting to come to an agreement on a small part of the project; then make sure that meeting is a model and a success. Don't make it a status meeting, but one where a decision will be made. You might also volunteer to run a meeting when the leader can't be available. One way to stealthily improve a meeting is to get a agenda produced for people that have to participate online or over the phone. The first ones won't be good agenda, but they can be improved over time. 

Talk to your college/university. Many of them have job assistance centers either at the school or the department level. During the semester many hold job fairs to not only find positions for internships but also jobs after graduation. Yes I know you graduated but many will allow recent graduates to use their services. They can also help with reviewing resumes and practice interviews. 

Have the free food offsite. Pick a local restaurant and go there. Of course with 40 people they will want reservations. Many restaurants also have private rooms, and you can either pick the food or let them order off the full menu or a subset of the menu. You also don't have to worry so much about no-shows. But sticking with your situation. You have 5000 people working on-site and the only room that can hold 40 people and food, is a common break room? I have worked in places that had either rooms off the cafeteria that could bring in food for conferences, or a room inside the cafeteria that could be used for a team function. Even if there is no cafeteria there has to be rooms for large conferences. Also food doesn't have to be exactly at peak lunch time, which may open up different options. A word of advice if having the food offsite make sure you cover their time while going to and from the restaurant. I always hate free food that I have to use vacation hours to get. 

At this point if he doesn't stop, then he is a bully and you should complain to HR. Of course the issue will be that he will now be searching for a new victim. So you might have to go the HR anyway. While I have not seen this exact situation, I have witnessed a case where one person was oblivious to the fact that they were trampling over another person. They didn't even consider that somebody had done this to be be nice. When told to stop they thought the victim was joking. Only when the the victim pulled the plug did they wake up to the fact that it wasn't a joke. 

That is the exact opposite of what I have found for those low level, early career positions. The companies I have worked with require a bachelors degree for many positions. The lack of that 4 year degree limits what positions that can be offered. The main reason for this is that that their customers demand that requirement. For the next level of positions I typically will see requirements such as bachelors plus 6 years experience, or master plus two years experience. While it appears that you went to work for a company that doesn't value education as much as experience specifically when you look at the $17,000 a year difference; You may find that the gap is closing. That lack of bachelors may permanently limit their salary growth potential as long as they stay in a technical field. Your friend may also find that other companies may not value their years of experience the same way the current employer does. 

We get questions on this site asking when you should tell your boss. Many people worry about being fired just for looking for a job. It doesn't seem like a good idea to quit the day before an interview. Their hiring process could take weeks, and you would have no income. Plus they might not select you for the job. 

Your resume lists your experience related to work, it is not a comment on your financial condition. Keeping in mind that your lack of filing and paying taxes may hurt your chances for some jobs, it is not relevant for other jobs. The sooner you file the required tax paperwork, the sooner the issue can be resolved. And the sooner interest and penalties will stop accumulating. You need to get expert help. 

Because you frequently apply during a semester most employers of interns know how to add the expected credits for this current semester to the ones you have already completed. In most colleges the student can request a version of the transcript that will include the classes you are currently attending. In some cases employer will specify exactly the number of years/semesters they want you to have completed. This is done to make incoming Freshman who have earned a few AP credits from qualifying for the position. It can also be used to eliminate seniors who are on class short and are trying to work as an intern in the summer while taking the last class, and then graduating in the middle of the summer. If we look at your situation: if you will have 61 or more credits at the end of the spring semester then you will be a Junior during the summer. If you will have 60 credits it is up to the employer.
