The article links one study and one website, however none of them seem to be about Imperial units at all! Are there any studies on the effect the choice of units has on mathematical skills? Is the Metric system advantageous, from the point of view of cognition? 

Her tweets are now protected so it's hard to say. However I think I found the preceding and subsequent tweet by her counterpart, the German "management consultant and economist" Bastian van Rieth. The dates work and the conversation flows -- the tweet you present can still have been manipulated though. 

Comparison of battery types As you can see, alkaline batteries, such as Duracell, can store up to 5 times more energy in the same volume. However, alkaline batteries also have a better energy efficiency, up to 85% against up to 60% (i.e. a difference is what percentage of the energy in the battery can actually be used). Alkaline batteries also self-discharge twice as slowly as zinc-carbon ones. All these factors are what probably justifies the claim by Duracell -- that said, I've found no evidence that Duracell batteries are any better than other brand alkaline batteries, which is what the claim seems to imply, but not say outright. 

Discussion Clearly reptilians, birds, insect and mammals do not share the same heart physiology. So expecting the same kind of mileage is unjustified. Compare for example the canary and the elk: both have the same life-expectancy of 22 years, but the former has a heartbeat of ~1000bpm, whereas the latter ~50bpm. Therefore it follows that a canary's heart will beat 20 times more than the heart of an elk. There are many examples like this in the data set. Dataset The dataset is available here (along with 32 references). There was no way of making it fit in here. 

I've tracked down (I believe) the original article. It does not support the claims of the author! The article is about the discovery that the meaning of words influences which parts of the brain are activated. It says nothing about negative words being detrimental, let alone peeling away neurons. 

There is no proof that ginseng has any effect on cognitive faculties, so it's not an established fact at all: 

Equality Clearly this is part of social justice, but in particular, gender equality is well studied in Europe and some of those countries are well above the average 

No. EEGs can be used to monitor the general mental state of a person and to diagnose disease. The kind of resolution that EEGs have, that is very responsive but with a low spatial definition, lets us examine the kind of electrical wave patterns in the brain. For example, alpha waves indicate a person being relaxed (Ref.) Some experiments have been performed to "read" people thoughts with another tool, fMRI. This is called "thought identification" and it is not at all controversial that it is being performed, as the page I linked shows with good references. For example IBM patented a machine to retrieve images from scans and visual images have been reconstructed in an experiment. Even then, fMRI is tricky to use correctly, as shown by recent results and meta-analyses (Scientific American, The Scientist). This doesn't mean that the results are bogus, but that results are way harder to achieve than "reading the brain waves". 

This claim comes (according to multiple Wikipedia pages) from Crampton, R. J. (1997), Eastern Europe in the twentieth century and after, Routledge 

I cannot find any good source to verify this. In any case I don't see how we can easily make such assertion (it could be an uncommon type with few examples left). 

This sounds like an extraordinary claim, requiring extraordinary evidence. Is there any study that contradicts Zeidan? Is he actually making the same claims, or is he a victim of sensationalist reporting?

—source Lighting a neon bulb is one thing, but how much power can be generated? This was studied multiple times, for example in 1976 by the US Department of Agriculture. One of the major risks (or opportunities to "generate" power) is when building fences parallel to high-voltage power lines. 

In other words: if the newer cars are safer than old models, they are even safer at 70 than 80! If you prefer to compare videos: 70 mph 80 mph Environmental impact CO2 emissions (per Km) are a function of surface area and weight of the car, which would not change. There would be a major change, if this law increased the demand for more powerful cars, which are less efficient. Finally, cars going faster experience more drag, in quadratic proportion to velocity. If we measure emissions per km, there is still a linear increase left. In other words, increasing speed by 15% will result in 15% more emissions, all other factors being equal. References: 

I find way more believable that the Greek would have used some symmetrically pleasing geometric construction, such as phi, to design the Parthenon, than assuming it's a mere coincidence. The figures match to within 5%. Regarding the Renaissance, the artists that extensively used the golden section during the Reinassance are:

In practice, Matt is completely wrong: while there is no evidence of short term gains from public R&D, it is clear that: 

No UFO has ever been revealed to be an alien spacecraft. That said, we can't explain all UFOs through natural phenomena. In some cases the sightings remain mysterious. From 1947 to 1969 a project called "Blue Book" was run by the USAF to investigate UFO sightings. The results are the following:

I've read in multiple places that two men have been arrested in New York for "manspreading", sitting on the subway with legs spreading. It seems quite unbelievable. First of all, I don't think people are arrested for travelling without a ticket, which surely must be a worst offence than occupying more than one seat. Secondly because it basically means that you could go to jail for not sitting properly, which I find immoral. Did it happen? If so, is it illegal to sit improperly? 

A bit of context. Mr Mihalovic is not a doctor, but an anti-vaccine advocate and a "naturopath" -- in other words: 

They can go on for a very long time. This is a documented medical example of a (admittedly very obese) person who stopped eating for 382 days under medical supervision.
