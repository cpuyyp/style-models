This is actually one of the things limiting the size of insects. They have no way to get oxygen to things deep inside their body. 

There certainly are toxins that will put people to sleep, paralyze them, etc. Spider Wasps for example paralyze their prey and then inject eggs into them. One interesting idea though would be for the grass to take carbon dioxide out of the air and store it in inflatable bladders around the plant or maybe in its roots. When a trigger happens such as a herd of grazing animals getting into the center of the field they all release the CO2 at once. Being heavier than air it forms a pool and suffocates all life in the field silently and invisibly. The field would then be fertilized by the bodies but safe to enter for a few months while they rebuilt their CO2 reserves. 

If the girl child does not know, does that mean that other people do know? In practice in this sort of case the selection of the child is pretty much a technicality and may well owe a lot to politics. A Regent would be appointed to run the kingdom in the child's name and would become King in all but name. The politics behind selection of the Regent and which child that Regent controls would likely have a larger impact on the results of the succession than the status of two illegitimate children. 

The good news is that with no diseases around one consequence from your low genetic diversity is reduced. The bad news is that it's unlikely humanity will survive, however it is possible. First we need to look at generation zero (g0). Astronauts tend to be older (average age 34), and also to have spent a lot of time in space being irradiated. Lets say we get a little bit lucky and both astronauts are still fertile and are at the younger end of the spectrum with the female being aged 30. They have around 20 years of fertility remaining, although if they get unlucky it could be as few as none or 10 years. If they produce one child per year and we assume an average of 1 survives each birth (which is not a forgone conclusion as modern medicine is going to be hard to access) then g0 was 2 people but g1 will be 10 to 20 people. Now there are two choices, you can either pair off those 10 to 20 people with each other or for maximum use of the original genetic variation variation the g0 male can impregnate all the g1 females. (Using artificial insemination would make this less "icky" but you're going to have some form of incest whatever you do). I'm not sure which of these approaches is going to be the most beneficial genetically speaking, I think g1<->g1 is going to have the highest individual success rate but g0<->g1 will introduce the largest overall variation into the population. You should also consider rotating the pairs, in particular if a pair did produce a child that showed the consequences of inbreeding that pair should not mate again. Whichever way you handle g1 you will want to create a tree mapping who is related to who and in each generation pair up the least related individuals. Any individuals born that show harmful effects of the inbreeding would not be allowed to breed themselves and both parents should be marked on the breeding chart as carrying that recessive. The parents should then be paired up with people who so far have not shown signs of carrying that recessive. Over time genetic diversity will return and more conventional relationships can form but it will be many generations before it does. 

Food is hard to find, and a lot of creatures burrow. They use the heads to send them down burrows to haul the creatures inside out. This does mean the heads risk getting trapped or damaged though so they evolved to be able to abandon trapped heads (ideally pulling them out and eating them to reclaim the nutrients) when needed. Many heads meant you were a successful hunter. It became a large part of their mating displays, as a result they evolved to grow more and more heads - but that wasn't sustainable all the time so they worked out how to collapse them when not in use. Eventually that evolved into the storage system. 

It at least partially depends on how brutal you are willing to be. There have been plenty of cases in history where the invaders killed every male over a certain age, enslaved the women, and raised the remaining children as their own. In those cases the conquered culture is pretty much completely eliminated within one to two generations. $URL$ The Mongols relied on a two-pronged approach. First they offered peace, you paid tribute and agreed to submit to Mongol rule and they treated you reasonably well. If you resisted though they destroyed you. They slaughtered entire towns, razed them to the ground. 

Take a look at the book "To Ride Pegasus" by Anne McCaffrey. It explores exactly this sort of scenario. Essentially they accidentally find a way to "measure" people using psychic abilities. This then allows them to find people with genuine abilities and train them, using the signals from the device, allowing much stronger abilities to be developed and trained. "How" the psychic powers work is never explained but by having a way to measure and study them it becomes a science rather than mystical. 

The problem with this idea is that air resistance would quickly slow the orbit of the asteroids, and bring them crashing down to the surface, it might work if the asteroids were out at geosynchronous orbit but then the atmosphere would just escape. There are two ways to get a similar effect to what you are looking for though, both of which have already been discussed in fiction: Rocheworlds Two tidally locked planets just outside the Roche Limit can orbit each other and share a combined atmosphere. You would be able to fly from one to the other without ever leaving the atmosphere and objects placed at the lagrange points would be able to remain there. This concept has been explored in the books Flight of the Dragonfly/Rocheworld by Robert Forward and Land and Overland by Bob Shaw. 

The answer is - very likely. Throughout human history you have people adopting dogs, cats, cattle, horses, snakes and so much more and living in symbiotic relationships with them. There are always limitations to any one species, if they can find and work with another species to mutual advantage then here is a strong reason to do so. Humans benefit from the speed, agility, and superior senses of dogs. Humans benefit from the speed and strength of horses. Humans benefit from cats or snakes eating rodents and other pests. All of those species though gain the advantages of human intelligence in terms of tool usage, planning, and similar without going through the costs of growing a bigger brain. For an alien species you can expect similar. A slow species would train fast animals, a blind species would train sighted animals, a warlike species would train attack animals, etc. The key thing is that the animals should provide a more efficient way to get something done than having the human-intelligence ones do it themselves. When both sides gain then you have symbiosis and the relationship is not just stable but actively self-reinforcing. If you are better at working with your animals and they are better at working with you then you gain a mutual advantage and over time you will both learn and evolve to work together better. This would start with natural selection and then over time selective breeding would enhance the desired traits in the animal species. 

The thing is that games such as D&D amplify the difference in power level between humans far more than is possible in real life. D&D Mechanics A high level warrior can survive hundreds of blows from lower level attackers, and with his armour and other defenses only 5% of those blows will even hit (using the automatic hit on a 20). If you factor in damage reduction then that can become even more drastic, even 5 points of Damage Reduction is enough to mean that your average low level combatant is barely able to scratch their target. In the meantime your wizard does have a limited spell selection but those spells include being able to strike an area with swarms of meteors, hem people in with force-fields, turn vast areas of rock into mud, enlarge the fighter to make him stronger and tougher, etc. Unfortunately the question doesn't specify the size of an army. So lets look at some numbers. A large medieval European army would have 5,000 to 10,000 people in it. So lets say there are 6,000 soldiers and you need to wipe out 3,000 to make the survivors flee into the desert (where they will probably die anyway). If you are going to say that the battle lasts an hour, then that means each of the 6 heroes needs to kill 500 in that hour, or 8 per minute. In D&D rounds of 6 seconds each that is just under 1 kill per round. Assuming the fighter has a 5% chance to miss (a roll of 1 on a d20 always misses) and only kills one target per round then that is still enough. In practice he would have the ability to strike multiple targets per round so would chew through them considerably faster than this. In fact these numbers are easily sustainable, assuming the average army member is low enough in levels then even once they ran out of spells the wizard would probably be able to able to take down one opponent each round just by hitting them with his staff. The warrior would be killing many more per round than that. I run a game at the moment where a level 6 warrior easily kills 2 or 3 low level targets each round. So, mechanically in a role playing game it works (although it would be a boring session!). But how does it work in terms of a "reality-check"? The Reality Check D&D is a very simplified model of the world. There are a number of things it just does not consider that to do a proper job of world building we should consider. Exhaustion The first problem is exhaustion. Fighting, especially in heavy armour or throwing high-powered magic around is tiring. In a Live-Roleplaying System I help run we do big battles (1000+ people on each side) as a part of the event. One thing we have learned though is to make sure that the actual battle itself lasts for an hour at longest. Once the hour is reached people start becoming tired and making mistakes and our number of Out-Of-Character injuries sky-rockets. We get more injuries in 1:00 to 1:15 than in the entire previous hour. So the six would need incredible stamina. The ability to keep up sustained life-on-the-line adrenaline-fueled combat for an hour with no let-up, no pause, and no breather. Missiles The second problem would be ranged weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, even slings or just thrown rocks. In melee combat only a few people can attack you at any one time. Even with pole arm formations or surrounding someone only a limited number can strike. With missile weapons though you could have a thousand arrows being fired at you volley after volley until finally one strikes a vital point. The target would need to be essentially immune to missile weapons, either through "kung-fu style" dodging and parrying, through impregnable armour, or through defensive magic. Even a slight chink in these defenses would eventually be hit, so they need complete immunity. Terrain could be used to mitigate this but in order to attack the army they would need to advance on it, so at some point would be vulnerable to arrow fire. Fire, Magic, etc Fire is a common weapon, even if someone is immune to weapons you can set them on fire and cook them in their fancy armour. You would need to be immune to heat, and have no need for external oxygen for protracted periods of time to walk through the fire unscathed. Additionally in any fantasy army you should expect at least some magic. The enemy heroes would come against you as would enemy spellcasters, etc. These high-priority foes would need to be identified and dealt with first since otherwise they might be able to take you down while the army distracted you. Conclusion You will notice that I mostly focused on defenses, that's because the enemy have weak defenses of their own so your capability to kill them is not in question. You just need to survive long enough to do so. Of course if you can kill them faster than this or if their army is smaller then you do not need your defenses to last for as long. I've also shown that mechanically in D&D and conceptually in a fantasy world it is indeed possible for 6 people to defeat an army. The reason this is not possible in real life is because it is just not possible for 6 people to become as invulnerable as is required. Even in real life though you should expect a team of 6 trained and equipped modern soldiers to be able to handle a much larger horde of people with inferior equipment. In real life it is the offensive power (automatic weaponry vs bows and arrows) that has changed while the defensive power has not improved by anything like the same margin. In most fantasy worlds both offensive and defensive power increases with levels, so that changes the outcomes drastically. The thing to remember about high level fantasy characters is that they are almost godlike. These are people who can wrestle a dragon, swim across burning lava, smash the stone wall of a castle to rubble, etc, etc. If conceptually you can believe a Dragon defeating an army then it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to think of a Dragonslayer also being able to defeat one. 

The factors for an animal are the same as for vehicles in many ways. Agility is essentially a measure of acceleration, and your ability to apply that acceleration in different directions rapidly. The limiting factors for acceleration as animals grow larger are: 

Have it use the cat design rather than the monkey design for climbing. In other words rather than grasping/manipulating hands it has more simple paws with claws that it uses to grab into the bark of trees rather than hands it uses to grasp branches. 

The distance involved is too long to realistically expect people to walk/climb it. Most plans for a space elevator have exactly that - pressurized cabins that climb up the cable. Usually there would be a row climbing on one side and descending on the other. Manned elevators would be pressurized, but cargo ones might well not be. In that case it would be possible to put on a space suit and climb onto a cargo elevator and get carried up into space. You would need a large oxygen supply to last for long enough as even without using your legs it would still be a long journey. You would see the ground sinking away further and further. The sky would get darker and darker as the atmosphere thinned while the horizon would start to curve. Eventually you would see the circle of the earth dropping away beneath you and just the darkness of space lit by stars above. But so long as you had a long enough duration space suit it would be entirely possible, and apart from the spectacular view, rather boring and uneventful.
