By entertainment I mean book publishing, music uploads like on iTunes or even movies whether DVD, Blue Ray, Netflix, Hulu whatever. So much is moving online, that's the future. Piracy cannot be stopped, Sean Parker of Napster a site that was hit hard and sued for piracy lawsuits of releasing music for free, he even said, "The war on piracy is a failure." If a war is something to be won, piracy will win, but how much is what I and others are worried about. Along with the big suits and artists/writer/actors/singers whatever, there are movie theater employees, Apple store employees, programmers for online entertainment companies, etc...the economy for this industry is huge and can be hurt a lot since as online media is growing so is online theft, hacking, and piracy. While it is good to go into a field of medicine, engineering, business (which this is), entertainment is a cultural classic and the people in it mostly work hard and moved up to get where they were in turn making jobs for everyone. Star Wars made like a billion last month, but that's now and that a big movie. Kick@ss 2 stars said another sequel can't be made because the last two were pirated too much. Scary. Is the industry's outlook more collapse than still being profitable in the future? 

It means that, at the current size of your production capabilities, if you want to produce one more unit of your product, you will have to spend 7 Euro. This, MC value is a quantitative description of the cost you pay if you want to adjust your initial production plan to a larger output and it is determined by your production capacities. Here is an example: You have a bus company and your service is to offer a one way trip from point A to point B, every day at a given hour. Now, your buses have 50 seats and your total cost for the trip is 100 Euro (fuel, road taxes, etc). In addition to that your licence says that you have to provide additional bus if the passengers are more than 50. In this case, if you have 49 passengers and in the last minute there is a reservation for one more seat, your marginal cost is effectively zero, however, if there are two reservations in the last minute and the total number of passengers is now 51, the 51th passenger's marginal cost is 100 Euro, because you need a second bus only for him. 

For years I've seen non-stop commercials of countries in the continent of Africa showing kids who live in sewage huts, parents are dead, war gangs and criminals rule their lives. Like in Captain Philips how those Somalia pirates were forced to do what they did because of where they lived. They were forced by criminals threatening their lives. Didn't the USA make their countries dry out and collapsed like many Middle Eastern ones? My professor showed a video made in Africa showing how 1 in 3 Africans are actually middle class. They have cells, cities, even women Presidents at times. So are things than better than in the past and if so why? 

I am looking for a recent literature review of consumer demand theory and its empirical applications. I have tried common places (google scholar, jel and jep papers) but no success. Any help is really appreciated. 

I am reading about the higher order beliefs. Before getting into the formal definitions, I will define some common terminology which I will need for the formal definitions. 

Given what you said about mathematics, I would recommend Theory of Value by Gerard Debreu. This book is probably more than what you need, but it defines almost everything clearly. Debreu writes in the famous Bourbaki style so mathematics is rigorous enough. For macro it is hard to get everything in the same book. There are books very rigorous, but they generally covers techniques that are essential to do research. 

Update: reflecting the remarks in the comments, a more direct version of the question would be: Is there a legal path through which CETA could act as a back door for TTIP? 

It should be noted that crisis recovery is strongly related with the present state and structure of the local, regional and global economy and thereby depends on different parameters, as it works by different rules1. Consequently, I wouldn't consider thinking by analogy, i.e. in terms of historical precedence a valid strategy for problem solution. The problem should be (could be) tackled only in terms of first principles of the economy, in your case in terms of first principles of the EU economy, which will inevitably result in a solution lying outside Greece itself and more specifically in the rebooting of the EU zone and recompilation of the regulations governing it in the direction of a economically (and politically) equal / homogeneous monetary union with surplus recycling mechanisms that assure the financial distribution in the deficit countries in the form of productive investments (that will in turn produce the needed growth), instead of distributions in the form of loans (as in the current situation). 

This may not be an appropriate question for this platform, but I couldn't think of any place that it fits. My concern is understanding about game theory papers. Whenever I read classical papers of Harsanyi, Aumann etc. I start to feel lost with unknown math. This happens a lot. I studied many of these classical concepts on a textbook level and I had no problem at all, but when it comes to the original paper I can easily lost the track because of mathematical sophistication. I know a little bit of real analysis (Baby Rudin first $4$ chapters), I have studied a little bit of topology (Munkres) I have also some background in set theory, statistics etc. So I am not a complete beginner. What I want is to understand, at least on a reasonable level, a technical game theory paper such as Harsanyi (1973a) and Harsanyi (1973b). Can anyone suggest me a study plan with books and such? It can start from zero level I have time and patience. Any advice will be greatly appreciated! 

You could find it by using your table to build a graph and interpolating the quantity that matches the maximum profit. Note: At this price of 7 Euro your firm should exit the market, as it is under in every point in this table, the minimal loss is -900 either for 100 or 200 units of its product, thus the answer to your question is units = 150. It will profit if it continues to grow, as its Average Total Cost is decreasing and the firm still benefits from economies of scale. 

Please answer all three if you can. I live in Connecticut, America, and of course global trade and economies matter as we are becoming more global from technology. December 2007 the markets crashed hard and 2008-09 was the actual defined recession. Worst we ever had (not depression, recession). By GDP growth definition we did recover. BUT living in Connecticut I've seen things differently so sorry if it sounds opinionated but I'm trying to put facts together from research and forum answers. GE Headquarters is leaving CT and moving to Boston, meaning hundreds of high paid jobs leaving and the taxes are switched to everyone else yes? Our governor has been called the worst, and we only have 3 million people which is down a lot in past years. That means less business and money which is not good. Taxes are already higher than almost every other state...BUT my question is are we recovering because form what I've read the answer is yes. But if a huge job supplier is leaving and tax burdens increase, how can CT ever recover? The same for America. Unemployment is like 5% but most of these jobs at least where I am on the East Coast are part time fast food/retail jobs. Good for kids maybe, but full time employment and good pay even start at $11 or $12 an hour is better than a father supporting his family on a 20 hour a week mcdonalds fry cook. So is this really a recovery (maybe definition) but has it really gotten better? Not just here...but the rest of the world as well? All I hear is bad stuff about Europe, debt crisis, Greece. What's going on? No blame game what is going on for sure that we know? 

I have seen that generically any finite games have odd number of equilibria. So for $2\times 2$ games can we say that generically they must have $3$ equilibria? If not can you give an example of games which have $5$ or $7$ equilibria? Many thanks! 

Now according to this definition for $E\subset \Sigma_{-i}$ we have $marg(b_i^2;\Sigma_{-i})(E)=b_i^1(E)$. I try to understand this definition. So I tried to consider a game in which there are two players $i$ and $j$ and two actions for each player. So $$ \Sigma_i=\{(p,1-p):p\in[0,1]\}\quad \Sigma_j=\{(q,1-q):q\in[0,1]\} $$ and $b_i^1\in\Delta(\Sigma_j)$ and $b_i^2\in\Delta(\Sigma_j\times B_j^1)$. So $b_i^1$ is a probability measure over $q$, and $b_i^2$ is a joint probability measure over $q$ and the first order beliefs of $j$. Suppose $E$ is the collection of $(q,1-q)$ such that $q\leq 0.5$, which is a subset of $\Sigma_j$. I could not convince myself why $marg(b_i^2;\Sigma_j)=b_i^1(E)$. Apologies for the length of the question and any help is greatly appreciated. 

I wanted to know facts, thoughts and such since this article (which was big news that trended this week) popped up: $URL$ I know "History always made NEW jobs when technology advanced...I feel like it's getting so advanced the new jobs, even repairing robots, will be done by robots and that is what is different this time. When the tractor came along there were no robots just humans to fix it.. I am a writer/journalist. However, these days a pencil and paper aren't enough. To survive we must adapt so I am learning online video and podcasts as well. No need for humans to work=no jobs for humans=no way for most humans to earn money= no way for the humans to feed themselves or their families or even provide warmth. Essentials for just living and not dying in poverty. I have started learning programming again through Codeacademy and research on Google, plus old books I had from a few years ago. Working on HTML, CSS, JavaScript (taught together) and some Java too. I know having a good understanding and practice of these languages will help me and others adapting to the future, but needless to say some people have it harder than others because of health issues or where they were born into. Been reading Investopedia.com as well to learn more. The job at a factory assembling or even as a truck driver is all some people have and use to make very good livings from it. With technology advancing in things like robots, computer software and even 3D printers, how exactly will the economy NOT collapse if we keep losing jobs...while still growing in population? Will it be likely we see increases of starvation, homelessness or communism?
