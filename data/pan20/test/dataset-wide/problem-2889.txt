This question presumes not only the existence of common sense, but that two individual's common sense about a very peculiar topic might somehow coincide. As Einstein categorized it, there were four major aspects of a QM interpretation: 

I continually find Tarski's work on formal languages enlightening. In particular, his undefinability theorem continually helps remind me where the limits of formal languages lie. The arguments also tie tightly into First Order Logic, which is a useful topic to grok fully when exploring validity in debates. Most debaters accept First Order Logic as valid, if you can get them to agree on the base axioms you want to use. Highly related to his work is Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, which are "stronger" than what Tarski looked at because he restricted himself to a smaller subset of languages where more stronger statements could be made. I then like to link to the Aggripan Trilemma, which shows how long such questions have been explored. These frustrations with provability are not new -- they're millennia old. This also can serve as a neat trampoline to spring into the field of epistemology, the study of knowledge itself. My personal opinion is that, if you're used to thinking in logic and programming terms, epistemology seems like a waste of time until you've gently jostled your preconceptions about just how effective our programming based tools are for managing knowledge. I find those three topics to be very effective at jostling (if perhaps jostling a bit too hard). From that point, there's some interesting segues into ontology because ontology is quite interesting when you're willing to question everything you know. From that point, you'll certainly know enough about philosophy to know what to ask for at the next fork in the road. 

Yes The total number of humans that have graced this earth: roughly 100 billion The total number of attempts at a theory of everything: probably 500-1000 billion. I would argue that every individual has tried and failed several times, because it is human nature. Consider what the purpose of a "theory of everything" is. Most definitions of "theory" imply that it must be testable -- thus a theory of everything must be testable by future tests. Since it's a theory of everything, it must predict all future events. Now at some point, most individuals contemplate the eternal. Religion spends a great time pontificating on the eternal... its a popular topic. To contemplate the eternal and one's life in one gulp calls for a theory of everything. This is pretty darn important if you want to make sure you pick the right religion! Of course, so far either 100% of these theories have been wrong, or all but one have been wrong (depending on whether you believe your current religion's theory is right or not). We don't give up; we pick our selves up and try it again! I would feel comfortable with the claim that every individual has gone through 5 or 6 "theories of everything" before they finish puberty, simply relying on anecdotal evidence. The tricky bit, of course, is that some of these theories look less like what you might expect a "theory of everything" to look like. Many of them include things like "God knows all" or "What goes around comes around." These are fuzzy phrases, but they are not any less a "theory of everything" than the infamous Grand Unified Theory of physics would be. In fact, there are three famous "theories of everything" which you may be familiar with: 

The end result is that much of TCM is doctor-centric. A doctor finds out what works well for them, and suggests it to others. The focus is less on rejecting bad hypotheses, and more on finding new good hypotheses. TCM relies more on natural attrition to weed out the hypothesis, rather than actively trying to disprove them. Can I claim one is better than the other? I'm not sure if I can. However, I do feel comfortable claiming that they are different, and that a remarkably large number of individuals consider one better than the other in both directions. It's simply another way to approach things. 

This is not from your essay, but from a comment you made above. It is very difficult to include irrational numbers in decimals without needing to be able to construct infinite series. The rational numbers "behave" much better than the irrationals in many scenarios. For example, the issue I mentioned above with 0.99999... equaling 1 is an issue that only raises in irrational numbers. This sort of strangeness never occurs in rational numbers. In the end, your opponents for this essay is proof theory, the Peano axioms (for natural numbers), and their realization in set theory. These three concepts are very very powerful concepts in mathematics. The multiple infinities that both you are a straight forward side effect of those basic assumptions. To refute the idea of multiple infinities is to reftue one of those fudamental cornerstones of mathematics. In that sense, your articles is not "A Refutation of Georg Cantor’s Findings about Infinity," but rather "A Refutation of All of Mathematics (or at least most of it)." Needless to say, this is quite the bold challenge, and your thesis will have to prove great implications before its value exceeds that of all of mathematics. Which leads us back to where we started. As Bumble pointed out, you are not the first one to question the canon definition of infinity. Some, such as the finitists, don't even believe infinity exists! However, when one looks at this from a linguistic perspective, this means the concepts encoded in your words will always be slightly different than the concepts similar words would encode when said by others. You are welcome to say "In my wording, a fraction is an adjective, not a noun." However, if you try to say "You are wrong, because fractions are adjectives, not nouns," you have attempted to force your linguistic constructs on someone. Your discussion of the philosophy of mathematics may benefit from actually learning more mathematics. For example, you may see that the mathematical community does not always agree on their axioms. For example, there is an axiom known as "The Axiom of Choice." In laymans terms, the idea of the axiom of choice is that you can have a bunch of bags containing objects, and in all cases you can construct a new bag that contains one object from each of the old bags. This seems obvious. You just go to each of the old bags, pick an item out of each, put it in the new bag. However, when you start playing with infinities, it gets murkier. So murky, in fact, that the Banach–Tarski paradox shows that, if you accept the axiom of choice (AC for short), you can take a sphere, cut it up into a finite number of pieces, and reassemble them into two dense spheres (no holes), with each sphere having the same volume as the original! Duplication! The result of this is that AC is not accepted by everyone. This duplication issue bothers many people enough that they will not accept AC as part of a proof. Set theorists who do not believe in AC who face a proof that demands AC will not say, "Oh, this theorem isn't valid. The mathematician proving it made a mistake." They will say "Oh, this mathematician assumed the axiom of choice. I do not accept this, but I can say that, if you accept the axiom of choice, the theorem is proven." Likewise, you are free to develop you own concept of mathematics, and bring it up to a state where others find value in it, but you will not be able to get away with saying "Oh, that statement it false" when what you really mean is "That statement relies on assumptions I do not accept, but if you do accept those assumptions, the statement is valid." 

What language do you want to phrase the most basic question in? No, really. That's the question where I'd start. I think the definition of the most basic question will actually vary from individual to individual. Not all of knowledge fits nicely into tree like structures with one fundamental question at the bottom. If you do try to construct such a question, it tends to be less than perfectly objective, indeed often personal. 

Running off the idea that there are undefinable numbers because there are countably infinite definable real numbers and uncountably infinite real numbers, one result that could be considered "important" is that no continuous chaotic system can be perfectly modeled by a Turing machine. Thus, if a truly chaotic dynamic system exists, it could not be part of a simulation of the universe that is running on a Turing machine. 

It looks like the paper has created two people named 'i' and 'j', and that caused the confusion. If I substitute Alice and Bob into that I get 

That would probably be the closes to an accepted definition of life that can be had from a scientific approach. One can choose to go beyond that, and define one's own criteria for life. There's no rule against it, no thought police that will imprison you for your crimes. One could define life in a way which uses the language of quantum mechanics to do so. However, if you use an existing word like "life" and apply a new meaning to it, you can expect to have to defend your definition, for we typically like to keep the meanings of words as clutter-free as possible, and "life" is already quite cluttered. 

Fault is heavily tied to causality, which is a topic of endless debate in Philosophy. Uncaused acts are very frustrating, because we want to find a cause. However, sometimes identifying the cause can be incredibly difficult, to the point where some argue that there are events without causes. I find the concept of fairness to be one built around the presumption that all people are equal. This is a popular conception, until you actually try to dig at it (how do I explain to my child why we are equals, yet I get to tell them who is boss?) Then we quickly find that we only want some ephemeral part of us to be equal. The issue is made more complicated in western culture, especially American culture, where we are taught that "we can be anything we want to be." That phrase is true, but there's a devil in the details. We cannot be (future) anything we want to be (present). Its very rare for someone to be able to decide "I want to be a fireman when I grow up" and go make it happen. What causes this problem is that we believe that we can fix things that are in our intellect to a specific value, and hold them forever. We encourage the belief that what we believe to be true is true and if it turns out to be untrue, we are encouraged to use our full capacities to enforce that truth onto reality. That's probably an overstatement. I'm certain there's more balance than that. However, I believe overstating it in that way demonstrates why the phrases you are studying are so difficult to convey. It's easy to interpret them in a "me against the world" mindset. If it becomes "me against the world," then its entirely possible you cannot do what you want because in many cases, the world is more powerful and more strong willed than an individual. Now consider the other extreme overstatement, pure capitulation. Pure collapsing. If you decide to make your desires to be whatever the world wants them to be, its easy to see that you have no aspirations, so you will naturally achieve all you set out to do. Needless to say, few believe this to be an ideal path (though "surrender" does show up in more philosophies than I care to admit). At this point I would dare to bring in some mathematics to bring the argument home. On one side, we have "me against the world," where it is easy to see why you may not always be able to accomplish what you want. On the other side, we have "do whatever the world asks," where it is easy to see that you will accomplish everything you want, because you want nothing of yourself. What if we considered the space between them. Let me make a highly contentious assumption for a moment: that there's a continuous line between them. If such a line exists, then it is mathematically provable that there exists a point on that line where you can accomplish that which you want by riding the balance between your wants and the world wants. I'd even go so far as to declare that that point is not just at the "capitulate to the world's desires," though to argue for why I believe that I'd have to go quite far into my own personal philosophy. I'd say a more useful phrasing rather than "You can do anything you set your mind to," may be "There is a place for you in this world, where you can accomplish everything you wish to accomplish at that time. If you work with the world to accomplish both of your goals, you can find that place." These phrases are also easily defended with game theory and drama theory. Many people who set out with the "you can do anything you set your mind to" forget to be flexible to work with the world, and instead become a battering ram to knock down obstacles. The trick is simply that you need to be flexible. Your Self needs to be flexible. Western philosophy tends to prefer to think of the essence of the self as rigid and immutable. Eastern philosophy tends to presume the self is always flexible. All real philosophies fit somewhere in that spectrum between extremes (real Western philosophy does have flexibility, real Eastern philosophy does teach rigidity).
