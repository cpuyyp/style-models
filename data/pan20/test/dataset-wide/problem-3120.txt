The question is poorly stated. The Founding Fathers were not all of one mind on many subjects— the Federalists saw danger in direct democracy, whereas the Anti-Federalists did not. Additionally, popular usage of terms like "democracy" or "republic" is quite different from a political scientist's use of such terms— indeed, quite a lot of things "don't mean what you think they mean," from liberalism to imperialism. Moreover, very few shifts in history can be traced to a particular "moment"; the world-historical figure as a character for study has been distinctly out of fashion for some decades. So, I will limit the discussion to the Federalist position on direct democracy versus representative democracy, i.e. a republic. 

The Phoney War (Sitzkrieg, Drôle de Guerre, etc.) seems destined to remain one of the great mysteries of history. It is difficult to comprehend now, after the fact, how such an astonishing combination of missed opportunities, wishful thinking, and indecisiveness on the part of not just one, but two great powers, could have carried on for more than half a year. The seventh episode of the 1998 documentary series Sworn to Secrecy: Secrets of War is devoted to Sitzkrieg: The Phoney War, and a good introduction. The period is also the subject of numerous books and papers— not to mention various conspiracy theories, and certain narratives of Western betrayal, especially in Poland. Full coverage is not possible in the space of an answer here, but this excerpt from William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers most the popular theories: 

Hormisdas is of Persian origin, and he possibly took the name to honor a Persian noble named Hormizd. In the tenth century we had a Pope Landus, or Lando, and various sources say that this name is of Anglo-Saxon origin. Lando was also his given name, however, and I find it unlikely than an Italian from Sabina would have been given an Anglo-Saxon name. What can be said is that he was the last pope to have taken an original name, until Francis. Incidentally, francis seems to have been the Latin name for the Celts or the Suebi, and not Germanic as you suggest. 

Ruhollah Khomeini came to prominence for opposing various actions and policies of the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the early 1960s, such as removing the requirement for public officials to swear oaths on the Koran, and the appropriation and redistribution of land from religious estates. He was imprisoned and kept under house arrest for a period, then on November 4, 1964 deported to Turkey. He remained in Turkey less than a year, then relocated to Najaf in Iraq, where he spent most of the remainder of his exile. He continued to agitate against the shah's regime, and as antigovernment sentiment intensified in Iran throughout 1978, the imperial government wanted to increase his physical distance from Iran. They pressured Iraq to expel Khomeini, and he was deported to Kuwait on October 6, 1978. He had originally planned to relocate to Syria, but his aides noted that he would be monitored and highly restricted if he stayed anywhere in the Middle East. He requested and received political asylum in France instead, and on October 8 he relocated to a rented house in Neauphle-le-Château outside of Paris. The move was a huge boost to his cause. It put him within reach of the international news media and sympathetic (at least in their opposition to the shah) intellectuals, but perhaps more importantly, the phone infrastructure in Europe was far more reliable, enabling him to stay in close touch with contacts in Iran and participate in the groundwork for the post-imperial regime. If he had stayed in southern Iraq, who knows whether he would have had such a profound influence on subsequent events. 

I've been reading through Hamilton's Report on Manufactures recently, and he suggests that women and children work in factories to help ease the labor competition between the North and South. However, this was highly controversial and people hated it. However, it was normal in Great Britain and it wasn't quite as contested. Why was Hamilton's idea so controversial and not Great Britain's? 

With the Hamilton (a musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda about Alexander Hamilton's life) craze going around, I've heard a few of the songs. While they are typically very easy to understand, one lyric I didn't understand was in "Washington on Your Side" when Madison, Jefferson, and Burr say: "[MADISON] So he’s doubled the size of the government / Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size? [BURR] Look in his eyes! [JEFFERSON] See how he lies [MADISON] Follow the scent of his enterprise [JEFFERSON] Centralizing national credit / And making American credit competitive [MADISON] If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it [JEFFERSON] I have to resign". What does it mean that Alexander Hamilton made American credit competitive? 

I'm reading The Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy, by Charles Beard, and I came across this quote on page 52: "It is an interesting commentary on the quality of Jefferson's democracy that he chose Madison as his successor." What is it referring to and is it true? 

I know that Lincoln's views changed a lot from when he was growing up to the Lincoln-Douglas debates, but how did his views change? From what? 

I've read in various Holocaust memoirs that the difference between being a "half-Jew" and "full Jew" could mean life or death. Obviously, Nazi treatment of a "half-Jew" was better than a "full Jew", but to what extent? What are some examples of people surviving because of better treatment by Nazis because they were "half-Jews"? 

I'm writing a paper about what events and ideas led to the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and one thing I'm using is the corruption in the English government. My evidence includes the fact that 120,000 people out of a population of about 7 million in Britain were able to vote. First of all, is that true? Second, if so, what were the voting qualifications? Property? Wealth? What made someone able to vote? 

I'm researching the Armenian genocide on a very basic level, and I've learned that a lot of the tension between Armenians and the Turks was because the Armenians were seen as supporting the Russians, who the Turks hated. Why was there such tension? What did Russia or Turkey do to prove one another?

It has nothing to do with ancient Greek culture or neoclassicism. Almost all American Greek-letter societies (including general/social fraternities, service fraternities, honor societies, and professional fraternities) follow the example of Phi Beta Kappa. Remember that the traditional university curriculum included a heavy emphasis on classical texts, and the tiny elite who enjoyed a post-secondary education for most of modern history would have had many years of schooling in Latin, ancient Greek, and Hebrew. There had been student societies such as the FHC, established in 1750 at the College of William and Mary. The letters FHC were the initials of a Latin motto, Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio ("brotherhood, humanity, and understanding"). As the motto was secret, the FHC was popularly known as the "Flat Hat Club." In 1776, a student named John Heath was denied membership in the FHC, so he formed his own organization in response. Instead of a Latin secret motto, he used a Greek one: Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης ("love of learning is the guide of life"), and so the organization became known as Phi Beta Kappa. Phi Beta Kappa was eventually forced to become an open society, but all collegiate Greek-letter societies more or less follow on the model of these early student clubs. Some, like Farmhouse or Triangle, do not use Greek letters; others, like Delta Upsilon, are open societies rather than secret societies, but for the most part they take the same model: letters representing a secret motto or principles; a creed or other philosophical basis for organization; and public and private tests for identifying members, such as a badge or secret handclasp. 

Anyone can declare that he or she is running for president of the United States. That is essentially unrelated, however, to whether he or she will be placed on the ballot, much less have a chance of winning. To become president, one must win a majority in the Electoral College, and barring an extraordinary bout of collegiate faithlessness, that means you will need to get electors who support you selected. The selection of electors is largely a matter of state, not federal law, but at the very least, you'll need to qualify for the ballot in every state and the District of Columbia. If you're representing a party, you'll need to be certified as that party's candidate, a process which also depends on state law and party rules. So, determining the longest-running campaign has numerous answers depending on how you define a candidate: Anyone who declares? Anyone who won delegates? Anyone who got ballot access? Anyone nominated by a party with ballot access in XX% of the states? Anyone who received above XX% of the popular vote in a primary or the general? Anyone who won electoral votes? Anyone who had an actual chance of winning? Some possibilities include the following: Major party candidates 

It refers to the people then and the people now, just the people in general who aren't happy with their government. 

So I understand, maybe, how arming people to hurt others is treason because the "others" who will be hurt are Americans. So is it treason if, for example, a gun store owner provides a gun to someone s/he knows will use it to hurt others? I'm sure that's something, maybe indirect murder or something, but is it treason? If not, why was John Brown's raid treason? 

What was the first civilization to, with a law, ban slavery that had it previously? For example, if Civilization X never had slavery and it makes a law banning it without ever having had slaves, I won't count that for these purposes. I've looked online but found nothing. *I'm aware of the other question about slavery. This is different because this is asking which civilization actually banned slavery after having it, not who was the first person to realize slavery was wrong. 

I've been reading some different sources about the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings and some authors seem to emphasize that she was essentially a sex slave, while other authors make it seem like it was consensual on her part. Is there any solid evidence either way? Obviously she couldn't exactly say no, but has anything been recorded that says she didn't want to enter into the type of relationship she had with Jefferson? 

Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (the slave he had an affair with) were thirty years apart in age (he older than her). I've asked a few history-loving friends and they told me that even if Jefferson had married someone the same age as Hemings (thirty years younger than him), it wouldn't have been frowned upon at all because 60-70 year old men commonly took teenage or 20-some-year-old wives. Now, however, most people would consider this behavior disgusting and try to help the girl. When did this shift happen in the US and how? 

I was told by a history-loving friend that one of the reasons Aaron Burr wanted to duel Hamilton was because Hamilton had published something rather derogatory about Burr's daughter Theodosia in a local newspaper. First of all, is this true? I've searched for it but haven't found anything- Google results are covered with "Dear Theodosia", a song from the musical "Hamilton". What did Hamilton write? 

In the Declaration of Independence, it says that King George III "protect[ed] [the British]... from punishment for any Murders which they committ[ed] on the Inhabitants of these States.” What are some examples of this? I searched for it but all I found was the Boston Massacre. Besides that (and even that one is debatable), are there any other cases of the king protecting the British from punishment? 

TL;DR: Russia was not interested. Fort Ross did only sea otter hunting; all attempts to grow food on any reasonable scale failed. California in general was a desert with half-wild grazing and no arable land, except maybe some of New Helvetia (which started wheat production only as late as 1840, and even that was barely sustainable). Of course lumber was great, but I doubt Russia has any interest in more lumber. Mexico was equally uninterested. When in 1836 von Wrangel talked to Mexican government about legitimization of Fort Ross, they agree on the only condition that Russia would establish diplomatic relationship with Mexico. Tzar Nicolas said that he'd never recognize this ungodly Republic. So much for the either side interest. I don't even want to start on the ghastly logistics of a military expedition to California. PS: Russia had a small window of opportunity to expand into Oregon Territory before 1805, but Paul was preoccupied with the Maltese knighthood. 

Russian Wiki gives the following breakdown: According to an Austrian military archive, upon mobilization in August 14, the Austrian forces consisted of 68.4 divisions. Of them 53.5 divisions (78.1%) headed to the Russian front, 15 divisions (21.9%) to the Serbian. In February 1915 there was 63.5 divisions, of which 51 (80.35) fought against Russians, 8.5 (13.4%) agains Serbians, and 4 divisions (6.3%) stayed at the Italian border. Upon Italy entering the war, Austria concentrated against it 21 divisions (30.7%), while on Russian front there remained 39.5 (57.7%). On Serbian front there was 8 divisions (11.6%). By February 1916 the contigent dropped sharply at Balkans to 4.9%, and somewhat rose at Russian and Italian fronts (59.2% and 35.9% correspondingly). Half a year later at Russsian front there were 45 divisions (58.6%), and 29.75 (38.9%) at Italian. At Balcans there were just 2 divisions (2.6%). By February 1917 Austria had 82.25 divisions, of which 59.6% were at the Russian front. ... During the Russian's summer offense of 1917 there were 53.8 Austrian divisions (60.3%). At that time at the Italian front there were 32.75 divisions (36.9%), at Balkans - 2.5 divisions (2.8%). At the truce of Brest there was 43.5 divisions against Russia and 41.25 at Italian front. 15.25 Austrian divisions participated in occupation of Russian territories, while the bulk of the forces (73.8%) were at Italy. 2 divisions remained at Balkans, and 2 more were sent to France. 

@Alex, while generally correct, presents a rather simplistic point of view. A doctrine of democratic centralism was indeed a cornerstone of power distribution in USSR. The important nuance is that to subordinate powers, according to the doctrine, the controlling organ must've appear united. That certainly gave the impression of dictatorship. In reality, far from it. Podgorny's removal illustrates very well that the Secretary General didn't consolidate enough power yet. As a side note, in a classic Brezhnev's Politburo an influence of people like Suslov, Grishin, Ustinov was comparable to Brezhnev's. As for "ordinary power", it was also a bit more convoluted. A Director of an enterprise (akin to CEO), an University Rector (akin to President), etc, was appointed by a supervising organization (everything had a supervising organization), and was subject to approval by a corresponding Party organ. For example, a Director reporting to an USSR Minister had to be approved by Central Committee. There was exceptions: Directors of some extremely important Institutes were appointed directly by Politbureau.
