The case $\ell = 3$ and $k = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ requires studying the plus and minus parts of the class group of $L$ (the plus part is the piece on which $\tau$ acts trivially). The key to the proof is the exact sequence $$ 1 \longrightarrow Am_{st}(L/k)^- \longrightarrow Am(L/k)^- \longrightarrow E_F \cap NK^\times / NE_K \longrightarrow 1 $$ for dihedral extensions $L/F$. The idea then is to show that if $\ell \nmid h(K)$, then the plus part of the ambiguous ideal class group is trivial, hence everything is in the minus part. There all ambiguous ideal classes are strongly ambiguous, and this will lead to a contradiction similarly as above. The proof given here is extracted from Bölling [Zur Klassenzahl nicht galoisscher Körper in Diedererweiterungen, Math. Nachr. 118 (1984), 271--284). 

It is a rather difficult result that primes of the form $x^2 + 27y^2$ are not characterized by linear forms; this requires limitation theorems from class field theory. Already Euler conjectured that $2$ is a cubic residue modulo primes $p = 3n+1$ if and only if $p$ can be written in the form $p = x^2 + 27y^2$. This was later proved by Gauss, Jacobi and Eisenstein. Cox has written a whole book about this problem, which I recommend to everyone interested in such problems. In your case, you have to combine this result with the question which of $a$ or $b$ is even in $p = a^2 + 3b^2$; this can be decided by congruences. 

In an unfinished (and as of now unpublished) article intended for the encyclopedia of mathematics, Arnold Scholz wrote: "Classifying extensions according to the Galois group of their normal closure provides us with a new point of view. Not only the minimal discriminants but also the mean values of the ideal densities differ considerably, and have the following values for discriminants with large prime factors: 

In his letter to Zimmermann (March 12, 1797; Werke X), Gauss wrote May God give the noble Duke a long life, and what may Science expect from him since he deems a work that is only a little interesting not unworthy of his support; how much I wish that I could present a work that is more profitable for society [serving the public good] or more excellent. Gauss was talking about the Duke's support for printing his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. 

Basically you will have to look for the largest abelian extension of ${\mathbb Q}$ with the same conductor as $K/{\mathbb Q}$. 

If I recall it correctly, the class number of the real cyclotomic field comes from its cubic subfield. Thus you might as well ask whether there is a connection between class numbers of quadratic fields ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and real cubic fields with prime conductor $p$ for primes $p \equiv 7 \bmod 12$. What little we know about class numbers comes either from analytic objects (zeta functions, class number formulas), class field theory, or elliptic curves. Since we are talking about abelian extensions of the rationals, I would expect an explanation for such a result to come from class field theory. But nothing I know could even be remotely responsible for such a relation. Indeed the only results that might be within reach would be "independence" results claiming that there are infinitely many fields for which one class number is divisible by a certain prime but the other is not. The problem why there are so few relations between the two objects has to do with the fact that the compositum of the two fields is a cyclic sextic field, which only has two nontrivial subfields. The units of these subfields do not generate a group of finite index in the whole unit group, which for me means that we should not expect any relation between the class numbers of these objects. On the other hand you never know; the class number $1$ for the quadratic field is connected with continued fraction expansions (see Zagier's book on quadratic fields and forms) - but real cubic cyclic fields seem to have preciously little to do with continued fractions. 

Artin's collected works are quite small, and his thesis (two parts) is put right at the beginning. Artin looked at quadratic extensions of the rational funtion field and distinguished between real and imaginary extensions; geometrically, these are affine pieces of hyperelliptic curves. The birational point of view, in which these distinctions disappear, was introduced later by F.K. Schmidt. Moreover, Artin talked about ideal classes instead of points on the curves. The rationality of the zeta functions follows from the quadratic reciprocity law in the rational function field. Given a specific extension, it is easy to compute the zeta function as well as its zeroes, and verify the Riemann hypothesis. This is what Artin did for extensions of small degree. F.K. Schmidt introduced "birational invariance" by looking at the projective curves and realized that the rationality can be proved by Riemann-Roch instead of the reciprocity law. I think Artin started reading Hecke only after his thesis, so he did not know about Hecke characters at the time. 

An approach based on cubic forms, which was used by Karim Belabas to quickly list cubic fields with discriminant up to a certain bound. The approach via class field theory mentioned above: look at all quadratic number fields with small discriminant, find all of its cubic cyclic extensions via class field theory, and check which of these are not abelian over the rationals (this set includes all whose conductor is not invariant under the Galois group of the quadratic field). The approach via Kummer theory: start as in 2., but then adjoin a cube root of unity; cyclic cubic extensions will simply be Kummer extensions over this extension. Standard methods (this should be in Gras' book on class field theory) allow you to step down once the construction is done. 

A quadratic order has unique factorization (or is Euclidean) only if it is the maximal order of a number field (it must be integrally closed); for your examples, this holds if and only if $c$ is a squarefree integer congruent to $2$ or $3$ modulo $4$. 

Takagi also proves the decomposition law in these extensions. Step 2 In Sect. 9, Takagi begins proving the analogue of the theorem of Kronecker-Weber. His approach is the one used by Hilbert in his proof of the theorem of Kronecker-Weber: Given an abelian extension $L/{\mathbb Q}(i)$, we write $L$ as a compositum of cyclic extensions of prime power degree. If the odd Gaussian prime $\mu$ is ramified in $L$, form the compositum of $L$ and the cyclic extension $K/{\mathbb Q}(i)$ unramified outside $\mu$ constructed in Step 1 and show that the compositum $KL$ contains a cyclic extension $M/{\mathbb Q}(i)$ unramified at $\mu$ such that $L$ is contained in $KM$; the case of wild ramification requires a careful investiagtion of the ramification subgroups. By induction, this process reduces the proof to cyclic extensions that are unramified everywhere. There are various ways of proving that such extensions do not exist: 

It is well known that Euler gave the first proof of FLT ($x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no nontrivial integral solutions for $n > 2$) for exponent $n=3$, but that his proof had gaps (which are not as easily closed as Weil seems to suggest in his excellent Number Theory - An Approach through History). Later proofs by Legendre and Kausler had the same gap, and in fact I do not know any correct proof published before Kummer's proof for all regular primes. Gauss had a beautiful proof, with the 3-isogeny clearly visible, which was published posthumously by Dedekind, and of course Dirichlet could have given a correct proof (he gave one for $n = 5$ in his very first article but apparently did not dare to provoke Legendre by suggesting his proof in Theorie des Nombres was incomplete) but did not. The problem in the early proofs is this: if $p^2 + 3q^2 = z^3$, one has to show that $p$ and $q$ can be read off from $p + q \sqrt{-3} = (a + b\sqrt{-3})^3$. The standard proofs use unique factorization in ${\mathbb Z}[\zeta_3]$ or the equivalent fact that there is one class of binary quadratic forms with discriminant $-3$; Weil uses a (sophisticated, but elementary) counting argument. I wonder whether there is any correct proof for the cubic Fermat equation before Kummer's proof for all regular prime exponents (1847-1850)? 

I don't think that this is too easy. By Golod and Shafarevich, there exist towers of number fields with constant "root discriminant". Whether these fields can be generated by roots of polynomials for which the index is bounded is, I fear, open. It might very well be the case that there aren't any considerable improvements over the family $P_n(t) = t^n-2$. 

I browsed Dirichlets Werke today and was kind of surprised by two remarks that he made on p. 354 (Über die Bestimmung ...) and p. 372 (Sur l'usage ...). In the second paper, he claims (my translation) I have applied these principles to a demonstration of the remarkable formula given by Legendre for expressing in an approximate manner how many prime numbers there are below an arbitrary, but very large, limit. 

In a recent article, Emmanuel Lecouturier proves a generalization of the following surprising result: for a Mersenne prime $N = 2^p - 1 \ge 31$, the element $$ S = \prod_{k=1}^{\frac{N-1}2} k^k $$ is a $p$-th power modulo $N$, and observed that he did not know an elementary proof. Neither do I. Numerical experiments suggest that $s_p$ is actually a $6p$-th power modulo $N$. I can't even see why it is a quadratic residue, i.e., why the following result (not proved in the article cited) should hold: $$ T = \prod_{k=1}^{\frac{N+1}4} (2k-1) $$ is a square mod N. For arbitrary primes $N \equiv 3 \bmod 4$, the following seems to hold: $$ \Big(\frac{T}{N} \Big) = \begin{cases} - (-1)^{(h-1)/2} & \text{ if } N \equiv 3 \bmod 16, \\ - 1 & \text{ if } N \equiv 7 \bmod 16, \\ (-1)^{(h-1)/2} & \text{ if } N \equiv 11 \bmod 16, \\ + 1 & \text{ if } N \equiv 15 \bmod 16, \end{cases} $$ where $h$ is the class number of the complex quadratic number field with discriminant $-N$. This suggests a possible proof using L-functions (i.e. using methods in (Congruences for L-functions, Urbanowicz, K.S. Williams) and explains the difficulty of finding an elementary proof. My questions: 

Galois deformations are an important tool in Wiles' arsenal for proving FLT. Are there any more elementary aspects (I'm thinking of 1-dimensional Galois representations attached to number fields) that would help the novice in better understanding what's going on? Here's what I have in mind. Let $\rho: G_{\mathbb Q} \longrightarrow {\mathbb C}^\times$ be a 1-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of the rationals factoring over some finite extension. Given a Dirichlet character $\chi: GL_1({\mathbb Z}/N{\mathbb Z}) \longrightarrow {\mathbb C}^\times$, we can find representations $\rho_\chi: Gal(K/{\mathbb Q}) \longrightarrow {\mathbb C}^\times$ for any cyclotomic extension $K = {\mathbb Q}(\zeta_N)$. Call $\rho$ modular if there is a $\chi$ such that $\rho = \rho_\chi$. The statement that every $\rho$ coming from an abelian extension is modular is the theorem of Kronecker-Weber, and in this form it can be proved using Galois deformations along the lines of Wiles' proof (see Tunnell's proof in Kowalski's notes). BTW if anyone knows a source for this result that is more readable than Kowalski's notes (which I discovered just a couple of days ago and haven't studied in detail yet) I'm all ears. Question: Are there other similarly "elementary" questions, for example in embedding problems or inverse Galois theory, that can be described in terms of Galois deformations? 

Furtwängler proved the principal ideal theorem when he was almost 60. No small feat given that Artin and Schreier simultaneously were working on it. 

Far from being able to even begin to answer the question, let me make a few remarks that perhaps shed some light on the situation. Gauss's result on the cubic character of $2$ was generalized in Dedekind's highly underrated article on pure cubic fields [Über die Anzahl der Idealklassen in reinen kubischen Zahlkörpern; J. Reine Angew. Math. 121 (1900), 40-123]: already in the early 1870s Dedekind had written 

Fermat's motto was "Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia" (many will pass through and knowledge will be increased). At another occasion he wrote about "passing the torch to the next generation", which I find particularly nice. "When kings are building, carters have work to do". Kronecker quoted this, in his letter to Cantor of September 1891. 

Let $m$ be a squarefree number, and let $d$ run through the discriminants of quadratic number fields coprime to $m$. Then the $2$-rank of the class group of ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{dm})$ is, up to a small term depending on the residue class of $m$ modulo $4$ and the sign of the fundamental unit involved, essentially the number of prime factors of $md$ minus $1$. This follows from Dedekind's version of Gauss's genus theory in quadratic number fields. Thus the answer to your question is yes for any $d$ (I've just seen that I switched your $d$ and $m$). You will get slightly cleaner formulas is you replace the usual class group by the class group in the strict sense, since the dependence on the fundamental unit will disappear. 

Billing (Beiträge zur arithmetischen Theorie der ebenen kubischen Kurven vom Geschlecht Eins, R. Soc. Scient. Uppsala (4) 11, Nr. 1. Diss. 165 S. Uppsala 1938; see Ian Connell's Handbook for elliptic curves for a modern presentation of the result) proved the following result: Let $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ be irreducible, and consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = f(x)$. Let $K$ be the cubic number field generated by a root $\alpha$ of $f$, and let $E_K$ be its unit group. Write $({\mathcal O}_K: {\mathbb Z}[\alpha]) =: m_f^2$. Then $$ r \ \le \ r_2(K) + r_E(K) + 2n_+ + n_-, $$ where $r$ is the Mordell-Weil-rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$, $r_2(K)$ is the $2$-rank of the ideal class group of $K$, $r_E(K)$ is the ${\mathbb Z}$-rank of the unit group $E_K$ of $K$, $n_+$ is the number of primes $p \mid m_f$ that split in $K$, and $n_-$ is the number of primes $p \mid m_f$ that decompose as $p {\mathcal O}_K = {\mathfrak p}{\mathfrak p}'$ or as $p {\mathcal O}_K = {\mathfrak p}^2 {\mathfrak p}'$. If ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{m})$ is a pure cubic field with $m \not\equiv \pm 1 \bmod 9$ cubefree, then the index is trivial, and $n_+ = n_- = 0$ provides us with the bound $$ r \ \le \ r_2(K) + 1. $$ On the other hand, the parity conjecture (see the article by Liverance pointed out by Dror) implies that the Mordell-Weil rank of $E$ is even for squarefree values of $m = 8b^3 + 3$, and the family of nontorsion points $$ P_b\Big( \frac{2b^3+1}{b^2}, \frac{3b^3+1}{b^3} \Big) $$ shows that $r \ge 1$. Thus the parity conjecture implies $r \ge 2$, and Billing's bound finally gives $r_2(K) \ge 1$.
