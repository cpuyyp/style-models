The best treatment for dehydration is prevention, be sure to drink enough water throughout the day. One easy way to tell if you are starting to get dehydrated is your urine. If it's clear to light yellow then you are hydrated, colors darker than that indicate dehydration. 

Also be aware of the surface you are running on. Always on the road or bike trail? Treadmill or grass? You may try running on a different surface to mix-up your workout and give your body an easier/harder workout depending on how you feel. I would give yourself a day of full rest and see how your legs respond. Feel good? Go back to running 30 minutes for a day. If you're feeling good, next run do 35 minutes. See how we're working our way back up to 40 gradually? Perhaps you increased the time/mileage too much and need to taper down. If the soreness does not go away after 2 days of rest, I would definitely consider seeing a medical professional just to make sure no damage has been incurred. You may also want to follow a training program like Hal Higdon's 5K so you can vary your workouts/runs. 

Your symptoms lead me to believe you have a very stressful day job or even life. In other words, by taking a day off you are removing the coping mechanism that allows you to deal with your stress - so the stress has no way out! If this is the case, I would recommend that you find the "root cause" of the stress and remove that. I think the reason why your question causes so much concern is you admit that rest is important yet are still experiencing stress when NOT exercising. Ask yourself if any of these apply. 

This example test was taken from LiveStrong, however, there are many other examples that could be used. This one increases both speed and incline. 

I could interpret your description of your activity as, I am exercising every day of the week.. If this is the case, I highly suggest that you give your body (and legs!) at least one day of full rest for recovery per week. It will ultimately fall upon you to learn how your body responds to the rest or lack of rest. Time your results and adjust your training as necessary for future races. Please come back after your race and let us know how you performed with or without the rest day! =) Best of luck to you! 

I'm going to answer your question in the way that you requested, "in categories not a list of examples". Metabolism Boosters 

From what I've found so far, there is still a need for a well-rounded training regimen. In other words, just running your target distance (in this case, 5K), on a consistent basis will not make your faster. Great 5K Runs Workouts from Running Planet recommends the following: 

Cool Runnings has a program for Advanced Runners. (Defined as: For men, 5K time is between 17:00 and 20:00, and 10K is between 34:00 and 40:00. For women, 5K time is between 19:00 and 22:00, and 10K is between 36:00 and 42:00) Hal Higdon's 5-K Advanced Training, where you could start on week 7 or 8 in the chart. Cool Runnings has another article that details how you can tailor your own workout based on distance, speed, and rest. 

I'm going to address only the supplements that contain caffeine. It appears that the use of caffeine in sports is a controversial topic. However there appears to be some base conclusions that are beginning to appear (emphasis mine): 

Note: Because you phrased your question as "how often and for how long I should run", this leaves out A LOT of other stress reducing activities, like yoga :) 

If you want to get good at cardio, you're going to have to do more cardio! Improving your cardiovascular fitness needs continuous activity for a window between 20 and 60 minutes (more advanced = more minutes). Some really simple guidelines from National Academy of Sports Medicine 

Does max heart rate vary by activity? No. Your MAXIMUM heart rate is how fast your heart can beat, or, contract, in one minute. For the same level of effort, my heart rate on a bike is significantly lower than when running. You will experience a difference in heart rate between these exercises because you don't spend the same amount of energy while cycling as you do running. 

There are problems with this because you have to store the water somewhere and it may not be convenient to carry large containers of water! Also if you drink less/more than your large container, you have to do a little extra measuring and math to get your total intake. 

Note, I'm assuming that you've already dismissed the idea of cycling. My suggestion would be in-line skating, aka roller-blading. Great cardio workout and easy on the knees. The only downside is that it won't burn as many calories as running though. You may also look into: 

If you want more info, check out The Principles of FITT. Here are some suggestions to squeeze in more cardio. Note: monitor the workouts of your classes, since it's hard for us outsiders to gauge how intense (heart rate) they are. 

I think the visualization technique you mentioned is good. You have to imagine yourself squeezing your shoulder blades together to really target your back. Otherwise you may find yourself cheating a little by using your biceps! If you want to take this visualization into reality, ask a friend to straighten their hand and put the tip of their fingers in between your shoulder blades (their hand should be vertical). As you do the pull-up, your goal is to squeeze their hand with your shoulder blades. This simple technique helped me so much because I was cheating too much with my arms. In my case I did have to lower my usual weight (i.e. machine assisted) until I got used to the new form. Note this works for other back exercises as well, like rows. 

A lot of people swear by caffeine saying that "improves" their workout. However I believe they merely enjoy the mental boost it gives them, aka more alert, rather than giving them a real, physical boost. Special note about Caffeine and Creatine I did come across an article that asserted that regular, high-doses of caffeine consumption interfere with creatine absorption! 

Performing the Test If you really want to find your "personal" heart rate, and I agree with Xenovoyance that you will want to do this supervised, you could use a treadmill and slowly increase your speed and incline in order to push your body to its limits. Basic prerequisites 

Are these signs of shin splints? If so how can I safely train with this condition, aka prevention and treatment? 

Focus on having good, well-rounded core meals, meaning breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Eating properly may reduce your snack cravings. Mental Awareness If you catch yourself snacking at various points of the day, try to ask yourself WHY you are snacking. Are you bored, stressed, depressed? When you smoked you may have formed unconscious desire to smoke at certain times or as a response to certain stimuli. For example, I've seen smokers light-up after every meal or every time they answered the phone. Once you become aware of these habits you can tell yourself "NO" and choose a better alternative, like a glass of water. Over time you'll re-train yourself to automatically go for snacks that won't increase your waistline. 10 Appetite Suppressing Foods I've included a list of 10 appetite suppressing foods from Men's Health to give you some snack ideas. Note this isn't a panacea but you may find that snacking on these may make you feel less hungry: 

I started running around my neighborhood, on sidewalks or streets, a few weeks ago. Recently, I took a new route on the bike trail (asphalt?). After a five-minute warm-up of walking, I started a slow jog when I started getting pain in my right leg. The pain was mild and located in the middle of my shin and on the outside of the bone. I stopped jogging and immediately started stretching. This stretch felt sooo good! 

The pad's sole purpose is to address that exact issue. I don't think it's dangerous at all, it's there to prevent injury to your traps. If using the pad allows you to perform this exercise, then use it. Ideally yes, you want to get to a point where you don't need it. However this article over at Stronglifts indicates that its usage is not optimal. 

I would proceed with making any changes to your diet slowly and incrementally, or in other words do NOT make radical changes. You could start with documenting your current eating habits. Track your meals and calories by using a journal/notebook or use an online/mobile journal like MyFitnessPal. Review your journal after two weeks and look at possible foods that you can target to either add, eliminate, or replace. Commit to making these changes for approximately 1-2 weeks until you get the hang of it. After that time frame, review again and target the next series of changes. Feel free to adjust the amount of changes you make (i.e. more/less) based on how well you managed during the last period. Of course you are still tracking your meals, right? :) Examples 

Caffeine does not appear to benefit short term, high intensity exercise Caffeine can enhance performance in endurance sports. 

Here is a list of foods that contain a high amount of water. Examples include watermelon, tomatoes, and bananas. Note that food intake will only amount to approximately 20% of your daily water intake, which means that you need to get the other 80% through drinking. One note about salt, 

Taken from $URL$ In Caffeine and Athletic Performance, the author concludes that its effects vary by sport: Pro: 

Please realize that you aren't the only person to feel this way! We've all had to learn our way around the gym. Some Tips: 

If rehab "speed" is your primary concern, I would consult with a professional who can tailor a program specifically for you. Having said that, "To the Googles!". Suggest perusing these articles for exercises that 1. you can do and 2. do not cause pain. Do not try to rush this, give yourself at least week of exercise before you move to the next tier. Note that some of the suggested phases in the articles are multi-week. EXERCISES Meniscus tear: Rehabilitation exercises from WebMd. 

Taken from Exercise as a Stress Management Modality You may also try to apply some of the recommendations from Runner's World where they summarize a list of stress symptoms and propose solutions to each. 

This is very similar to my recommendation except you need a second utensil solely dedicated to measuring. 

No. After a workout your body still needs water to get rehydrated which could take hours. Sleeping means you aren't drinking! Resources/Links Read more on dehydration with this FAQ. 

You said that you recently went from 30 minutes to 40 minutes. Your pain is most likely from your body adapting to the new mileage. Although you should make sure you are doing your part by: 

I would suggest that you have someone critique your squat form first. Find a friend or maybe a trainer at the gym to see if you have proper form. Assuming your form is correct, then we'll need to feed you some exercises that should strengthen your body to support the squat exercises. Trouble doing squats, try these exercises: 

Yes, it is definitely okay to drink water during a workout! The main concern is to stay hydrated since an athlete that is dehydrated performs poorly. The 7 Hydration and Exercise Rules That Every Athlete Needs To Know recommends that you should drink about 600 - 1,200 ml (2.5 - 5 cups) of liquid per hour, which is just below your 1.5 liters that you like to drink. If you want to drink less during your workout, you could always try to drink more before your training. Try starting to drink some water, every hour starting 2 hours before your workout. 

When you start feeling comfortable, move to the free weights. Start with a low/light weight and perform the exercise to warm-up and to focus on form. When you perform the exercise with weight, do it in front of a mirror and ask someone to watch your form. The mirror is there so you can see how you are responding to their feedback, allowing you to learn what the proper form should look like. 

I found the mileage for the Ragnar Relay Wasatch Back race and it doesn't seem to be as punishing as a marathon since there seems to be rest in between each leg of the race. I know tapering before the race is important to marathoners but since this race isn't a marathon tapering will most likely not be a critical issue. See It's Taper Time for tips on tapering for shorter races. 

To find your maximum heart rate you can use an online calculator like this one that will run a number of calculations against your age (there are many formulas for calculating MHR).
