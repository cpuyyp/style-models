Thus they claim, further, that this rules out hidden-variable theories of the Bohmian type, which (they imply) employ exactly these models of stochasticity to provide a model for the indeterminism associated with measurement. One refreshingly new angle in Conway and Kochens argument, is that they take freewill seriously enough to see what can be said, because of it, about the physical world. Thus they also point out: 

You are operating within the laws of classical logic. If God is all-powerful he'll can possibly change the laws of logic itself to allow what you suggested is for him impossible. I say possibly as this is to a large extent speculation on my part. However note that there are paraconsistent logics in the Western philosophical tradition within which allow inconsistencies and intuitionistic logic which drops the excluded middle; the Eastern philosophical tradition has the catuskoti one of which allows the possibilities of contradiction. Of course this itself a little anthropomorphic - for him to change the laws of logic. One could say alternatively that there are no laws of logic for him - since he is the ground of all laws. Though I'm not sure quite this means in practise. 

As a dialogue it's aim is to understand what so far is known, and which way each leans - it's this clarification that is operative here. They quickly go over the position of reality independent of thought: 

Which is not far off descriptions of Socrates himself; it's hard not to think that it's Socrates counselling his younger self. The subject of the dialogue, surprisingly, is the nature of knowledge - Socrates asks Theaetatus is there a simple formula for it. This, in essence, is the gist of your own question - to establish a simple formula for knowledge; such formulas have been established already - the Descartian axiom, the Turing Test and Wittgensteins Logic - but of course these are at best partial answers; it's also in the context of this dialogue that Godels incompleteness theorem displays it's special interest, at least philosophically. 

I had associated with the Chilean biologists Maturana and Varela; but given N Alexander's excellent answer, it appears that Luhmann applied this in his own work in Systems Theory. 

By chance, the animals form 'useful' ie fit, for a 'purpose', ie it's environment construed broadly; which they 'survived'. 

First, I would suggest that meaning is intersubjective; this gets away from the notion of Descartian subjectivity which is self-subsistent; requiring no other. This is Lacans distinct contribution to modern European philosophy (through his notion of the Mirror, which is just his allegorical method of re-introducing this truth; the face of the mother, or father being the 'mirror' in which we see ourselves; where we resolve a Unity of Apperception at the level of subjects; not of sensations - a la Kant). (Unger takes this further, he grounds freedom in this acceptance). In this picture, Crusoe on his isle, alone; would not survive for twenty years to return to the life-world; but his unity as a subject would dissolve; one cannot say disrupt; as nothing has acted on him to disrupt him; unless one goes along with Sartre (in Nausea) and say pure nothingness can act in this way. In a different tradition, say Native Americans; aloneness is not the conditions for nothingness, as such; but to enter into a different dimension of being; the spirit world (see Black Elk Speaks). A parallel here might be with Rilkes Sonnets to Orpheus: 

That is it's roughly equivalent to our idea of matter; Anaximenes, a later philosopher chose air rather than water (notably this is two of the four elements), and Anaximander, his student etherealised it into the apeiron. Why would Russell choose water as an 'originary' principle rather than a 'matter' principle, particularly since then a theory of matter had already been worked out and was at hand; was there in fact two competing explanations, and Russell chose the 'originary' one? Had he not read Aristotle, or was he working from bad translations (assuming he had little greek). 

Badiou, a French philosopher counters the modern form of sophistry (Postmodernism and other ills) by what might be seen as a modern form of Platos forms by steering philosophy towards a philosophy rooted in mathematics - he takes his starting point the axiomatisation of it within set theory - that is ZFC. One might say he's resurrecting a grand narrative. Philosophy for him is a point from which three 'truth procedures' are suspended from: Love, Science & Art. (Being an avowed communist of the Maoist kind - he is rigourously atheistic, but for the religously inclined philosopher one may suppose that Religion comes under Love). Nina Powers, a British Philosopher (a follower of Badiou) takes a more modest view of philosophy and considers it empty of content (or taking a 'Buddhistic' view - lacking its own essence), and thus by only embracing one of those three conditions can it be said to have content or substance. 

Looking at the sky, we seen the moon, stars, sun and planets. Their motion have been plotted since Early Babylonia, and gods and godesses have been associated with them. When, so we are told, men began to think about Astronomy rather than Astrology, and Materiality rather then Mythology in Hellenic Antiquity, did they then begin to suppose that these moving objects in the sphere of heaven may also contain life? If they did what reason did they put forward for that? Or did it happen much later, say in the late Renaissance, after Galileos discovery of the Moons of Jupiter. It certainly must have happened before Jules Verne novel of 1865 - de la Terre a la Lune (from the Earth to the Moon). (Returning to the scene of mythology - did one then think, say that goddess of the moon, Selene lived on the moon? Or the god of the Sun - Helios lived on the Sun? Probably not - I suppose they were seen as embodiments, or the spirit of the Sun or Moon). This isn't really metaphysics, as is usually understood, but I couldn't think of anymore appropriate tags. I suppose I see the question of life like us elsewhere, that is not on this planet being a fundamental question of natural philosophy (physikoi) as understood in these terms in Early Philosophy. After all, once it was deduced that the earth was a sphere, as was done in Hellenic Antiquity, and presumably hanging in space; and seeing that the Sun & Moon are also spheres - the natural question would have been are they like Earth. One might assume that the Sun was discounted as being too hot. But that does leave the moon as a possibility. 

It is this dictum from Hobbes (in Leviathan) that also informs Burkes view of sovereignty; (Hobbes distinguishes between two forms of soveriegnty de jure and de facto, the first is characterised by the Social Contract, and the second by the right to levy taxes, raise a military and enforce ideology - which in his day was religous (these come apart in a situation of contestation)). It is this that informs Schmitts famous (in places)
