Stability is great, despite my initial skepticism. At 225lbs I can get out of the saddle no problem although it feels odd not balancing the bike yourself. Folds down to about 8" tall, 26" x 18" so not too difficult to store. Resistance is based on how fast the wheel spins: gear up for more, down for less. 

That's an impressive amount of mileage on a single chain. Especially on a narrow 11-speed one. I'm guessing that you keep everything very well maintained and don't ride in much wet weather? The two main problems you'll get from a worn cassette are: 

Interesting tool. I haven't used one but can sympathize after breaking many tire levers with my old tire+rim combination. It's no fun being in the middle of nowhere and snapping a lever while fixing a flat. I've since switched tires (and later the rims) and can now roll the tires over the rim by hand -- what a difference! Unless you plan on taking this tool with you on rides, you may want to look at tires that are easier to work with (if this one is new, you can probably exchange it at your LBS). Otherwise a single flat could end your ride. For beefy plastic levers, I'm now using a set of Pedro's. They're about 3-4 times the size of the ones I had before and were strong enough to wrestle my bad old tires back onto the rim before I switched. To avoid pinch getting flats while putting the tire back on, try putting a bit more air in the tube. This will make it hug the inside of the tire instead of getting caught between the tire and the rim. 

It's difficult to judge the quality of a tire hanging on a rack in a bike shop. Experience (including recommendations) is an important factor, since it takes 1000's of kms to put a tire to the test. When deciding on a touring tire, buy a set to try out pre-tour. You'll get an idea how they handle, how fast they wear, how puncture-resistant might be just by using them for everyday riding. Then when you're ready for the big trip, put a fresh set on the bike and save the worn ones for when you get back. Certainly wider tires will help on rough roads. Thicker tires may last longer. For puncture resistance, stay away from racing tires and look for ones with a kevlar belt (or similar puncture protection layer). If you know the roads may be bad, plan ahead and get a wider set for the entire tour. Don't plan to buy wider ones during the trip -- you never know what will be available when you get there. Conversely, if you find yourself having to replace a tire while on tour, your options will likely be limited. You'll just have to settle for what you can find. (I once had to replace a split road bike tire in a small mountain biking town but only one shop carried my size -- an off-road knobby tire. Still better than a split one!) 

Ultimately it's a trade-off between a wider range of gears and bigger jumps between those gears. There will always be uphills that are too steep for your lowest gear and downhills where you spin out. If you try to fix both problems with a wider range cassette (your triple already has a great range) you may find that you're never quite in the "right" gear for all of the in-between situations. I'm using a 11-32 cassette on my road bike (with a MTB derailleur for more capacity). I have plenty of climbing gears but rarely use the small cogs since I spin at around 90rpm. Like the Bay Area, there are a lot of hill around here. But I find the jumps between gears too big (either spins too easily or too hard) so am looking for a narrower range cassette. If you want just a bit more range for climbing, you'll need to jump up to at least a 28-tooth large cog (you'll barely notice the difference going from 26 to 27) which might require a long-cage derailleur. On the high end, a 12-tooth cog will be a noticeable difference over your 13. Since you're used to a compact range you probably don't want to go with a much bigger cassette. Sheldon Brown has a great gearing calculator that you can play with to see what different combinations will give you. 

My only cycle trainer experience is with the one I bought, an Elite Fluid Primo. It's a fluid trainer with a beefy stand, so less noisy than other types and the design is fairly simple. Just a matter of clamping the trainer onto the bike's rear axle and you're ready to go. As an apartment-dweller, I've got the whole thing setup on rubber tiles from Home Depot to reduce the amount of vibration sent to the neighbours below. As far as your criteria: 

My favourite resource is the BC Randonneurs website (very biased, since I'm a member). The links at the bottom of the page go into more detail on what I've covered. Randonneurs USA will probably be useful if you're looking for a US-based club. If you love riding, enjoy challenges and are very persistent (read "stubborn") than I'd highly recommend it. Most clubs run shorter rides called "populaires" which are open to non-members and give people a chance to try the sport with only a 50-100km committment. 

Most bluetooth accessories (like headsets) expect to pair up with something smarter, like a cellphone or computer. One simple alternative would be to each use a bluetooth headset and cell phone. Start a call at the beginning of the ride and stay connected until you finish or part ways. You will ideally need a cell plan that allows unlimited calling to a specific number (your cycling partner's) or else plenty of minutes. 

I've mounted lights with similar clamps on carbon forks with no ill effect (just have to be very careful not to over-tighten the clamp) but a lock -- which is heavy -- might put a too much torque on such a small clamp. Maybe if you could spread out the area over which the clamp attaches to the frame then it might be ok. What about attaching the U-lock behind the seat? Hang two loops (tie wraps, wire, string, etc.) from the seat rails and pass the straight portion of the lock through them. Then secure the bottom of the "U" to the back of the seat post with a velcro strap (put some padding between the lock and the frame so that the lock doesn't bounce and scrape the seat post up). 

Pedal Selection Pick a system that will work well for your current and future use. It's annoying to have different shoes for different bikes. My experience is limited to Shimano SPDs and Crank Brothers systems -- both of these work very well for road and mountain biking. The shoe cleat is similar for both systems and is fairly small, which means you can use it with shoes that allow recessed cleats. Very nice to be able to get off the bike and walk like a human being rather than a duck. If you're just starting out with clipless, definitely get double-sided pedals (some "road" pedals only clip in on one side). If you think you might still occasionally use the bike with regular shoes, consider getting a pedal that also has a normal platform. One other thing to keep in mind: float. This is how much freedom your foot has to rotate. Some folks like almost no float, others like/need plenty -- I need lots for my peculiar pedal stroke. If in doubt, err on the side of more float, your knees will thank you. Shoes Like regular shoes, fit is very important so make that your first priority. Remember that your feet swell later in the day so don't try shoes on first thing in the morning. Also look at sole stiffness. A completely rigid sole transfers more power, but is more awkward to walk in. A partially rigid sole is a good choice for touring where you're not likely to pack a pair of normal walking shoes. I have a pair of each but much prefer the rigid soles for normal riding. Both pairs have recessed cleats. Practice Once you get your nifty new shoes and pedals: practice, practice, practice! You need to be able to unclip on either side at a moment's notice. Practice coming to a stop and unclipping -- better to get it right when you're not in traffic trying to stop at a light. That said, you will probably still have a few falls. It normally hurts your pride more than your body and this phase should wear off after a few months. 

I've only worn out 3 or 4 pairs of regular shorts in the last 18 years, so it's possible to make them last. I try to buy high quality pairs and relegate the older ones for use on the trainer. Proper care (gentle cold water wash, hang dry) is important to keep them from wearing out too soon. If the shorts develop large holes, lose their stretch or the stitching starts to come undone, then it's time to say goodbye. Also watch out for the chamois bunching up or getting rough in places. 

Keep your knees warm. Knees have very little insulation by themselves and as the temperature drops the fluid in the joint will get more viscous plus you'll get less blood flow. I try to keep my knees covered any time the thermometer dips below 20 degC. If you're wearing jeans that are loose enough, you can try wearing cycling knee covers underneath. They'll keep your joint warm and the compression will help too. Check your saddle height. As @jefferee pointed out, pain at the back of the knee is a common indicator of your saddle being too high. Try lowering it 0.5cm or so and it should clear up quickly if that's the case. Otherwise it's something else. Get your bike & cleats fitted. A serious bike fitting session might be overkill for commuting, but this is how I eventually cleared up my chronic knee pain. You may have an unusual pedal stroke, or one leg longer than the other which might require fine tuning your saddle position and cleat adjustments.
