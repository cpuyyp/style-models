Consider that for something to be impermanent it must have some sort of arising. Arising implies Cessation. Without arising, there can be no cessation. So you tell me, does space arise? Or is it simply the unawareness of space that ceases? At any rate, compassion is a much more profound topic to put your efforts toward, for "the view of emptiness without compassion shall not lead you onto the sublime path" ~ Saraha 

Practice the Four Immeasurables, the four divine abodes. Potential practice methods: There are four, pick one a day and spend a few twenty-minute sessions meditating on it. 

Multi-tasking is an illusion... I have read that the mind and the senses are like a monkey sticking its head out six different windows rapidly in succession. A great lama once told me that trying to solve a puzzle when you sit down to meditate is in actuality making another samsara. 

Think to benefit all sentient beings with your gift, that the benefits may echo out into the cosmos and into all planes of existence. Set that mind when you give, and lose yourself in the action. 

If you have crossed Arising and Passing away (mistakenly taken as kundalini, or enlightenment experience) Yes, it is expected you go through it at some stage. refer to: $URL$ $URL$ 

My two cents: It is not easy to come to a conclusion from the behaviour alone. Consider: A1. Ignoring the error due to indifference/apathy, not caring for whatever the outcome or result. A2. Not interfering with it, because there is good in everything and allowing the natural process to evolve - not siding with push or pull to change the outcome one way or the other, but staying with it, observing one's reactions as well as accepting things as they are. And: B1. Correction being done because one cannot accept the presence of an error, a reaction to correct things based on one's view of how things should be. B2. Correcting because of compassion, in-order to benefit all the beings that may chance upon this. To me, both A2 and B2 are equally good, as they are a display of true equanimity and compassion, respectively. A1 and B1 are not actions without demerit, but B1 is slightly better in a sense because there is a greater chance to learn from it than A1 (going ahead and committing even a mistake is better than totally ignoring it, in my opinion). Of course, in a community managed site like this B1/B2 are the better options, but in regards to right action for mindfulness practice/self development both A2 and B2 should rank equally. 

Really? The shining of the sun is happening naturally without the need for a "shiner" Where does cognizing happen? Or even better, if you drink a cup of tea, where is the drinker? Is the drinker in the hand? In the tea? In the cup? Buddha Shakyamuni taught that there is no independent, lasting self, which is what selflessness alludes to from the perspective of pure wisdom. The fact is, even a single action by a single person requires the rest of the universe to come into alignment at all. Now, when coming to consider our very personal and intimate experience of the world, we find that we all have proclivities, patterns, and pathways or courses through life that are distinct and fairly individual. However, all beings wish for freedom from pain and discomfort, and yearn for bliss and happiness, we all just go about it in ways that may be contrary to our goals, and the Buddha taught true causes, true effects, true pathways to where we want to go. One of the contemplations taught by the Buddha was the contemplation of selflessness. Without faith, it is not possible (in my limited perspective and ignoramus opinion) to realize selflessness. With doubt we can sharpen our perception and acumen to a degree, but when one sits down to try and realize truths that were illuminated by the Lion of Speech (another pet name for the Buddha), doubt is a huge obstacle. So rather than doubt whether or not selflessness is true, we can doubt the notion of a self. We can investigate: if there is a self, where does it dwell? Does it dwell in the body, does it dwell in the mind? Is it the same as the body? Is it the same as the mind? When your attention is focused on a sound or on a flavor or on a taste, would this experiencing be a Self? What happens when the experience dissolves or the rest of the cosmos transitions. Where did this "lasting self" go? Was it ever actually there? We may be fooled and think selflessness means that we have no agency or power in the universe, but it is precisely because identity is not a static thing that we can grow and make our way towards Awakening. So consider with any phenomenon: where is its self nature. Does it perhaps come into being based on all the phenomena around it? Does this computer exist in the way we think it to, or does it arise due to the circumstances and all the parts and intentions coming together? anatman may be translated as selflessness or identitylessness and both terms are great for meditating. If they are difficult to accept as truth or reality, then we must contemplate them over and over and ask questions. Finally, when we have faith that there is no alternative to all forms of existence exhibiting the (three) marks of existence [selflessness/identitylessness being one of the three marks] then we can sit down to meditate with great faith and inspiration and gratitude to the Buddhas. 

I have experienced the same things that Andrei has mentioned, i.e., loss of joy, relating with normal people, loss of interest in entertainment and other worldly stuff (in no particular order). It even became crippling at one point when I didn't clearly understand what was happening and tried to correct myself unskillfully. But as with many things it was a phase and I no longer suffer from those issues. Some things can become worse before getting better, so even if certain things seem to become problematic at some point it doesn't mean that it will remain that way. I know its not wise to generalize, but that is my experience anyways. 

The sights and sounds were always there. Since your question is about why it is different when you meditate as opposed to the days you don't, may be you need to understand what happens on those days in order to understand this increased sensitivity ? Maybe your mind was caught up in worrying about fulfilling commitments, like reaching university on time. Maybe you were daydreaming, or probably just scanning the environment and only noting novel and interesting stimuli. Probably this doesn't happen on the days you meditate. I don't know about your typical meditation session, so I am assuming you are watching the breath. So you watch the sensations that make up the breath for a period of time. You are not only looking at interesting sensations during this session, you are looking at all the sensations - if you are doing it right. So after this session, when you go out, its only natural that you are not looking at just interesting sensations or worrying about getting somewhere, but looking at all the sensations that make up the external reality. 

With enough relaxed meditation, relaxing the speech and the thinky/discursive mind, one can collect and attune their pervasive-attentiveness to an investigation of self and if all the aggregates are truly selfless, as is taught. Metta and joy. Just offering some notes to aide, perhaps they will be helpful. 

Metta is a feeling of love or loving-kindness and is cultivated in a variety of ways. You can listen to various techniques and talks on dharmaseed or find a teacher with whom you vibe with and watch a video or read it in a book. The earliest reference is the Metta Sutra, as far as I know, and it is all about engendering a mind of good-will and loving, dearness, and fondness directed at sentient beings (and eventually all phenomena). Karuna is often translated as compassion. Karuna means you are aware of what suffering is / how you yourself do not wish to experience it, and therefore when you see it in another you wish for them to not have to carry it. Karuna is also the yearning to remove suffering and its causes. Compassion literally means "to suffer with" so it is based on an understanding of our equality as beings and our mutual striving towards happiness. They are not opposites. In the teachings I have been studying lately, it is stated that from the field of loving kindness a mind of compassion can easily blossom, so they are mutually helpful. When we have love for beings then it is a natural extension that we wish them to not suffer and to be free of any cause that could lead to future suffering. Anatta implies that what benefits one can and shall benefit us all, and dukkha is simply what needs be abandoned. Metta and Karuna, as you may know, are two of the four Brahma Viharas or Divine Abodes or Divine Dwellings. Also known as the Four Immeasurables, they are called Dwellings or Abodes because a mind steadily accustomed to their contemplation and saturation easily "dwells" of "finds home" in such wonderful states. 

What you are describing is a state you reach when you practice meditation. This cannot be anatta since anatta is not a state, it is a property of existence present in all things. Rather, your description looks like you have reached a state called access concentration. This is the first but important step in practice. This is the state where mind no longer gets lost in usual wanderings, and breathing becomes relaxed, with mind staying with the object of meditation (breathing). Thoughts don't arise or if they come, they stay in the background, because the subtle tension that gives rise to thoughts doesn't become strong enough to distract and goes to the background (This is what I believe you meant by mind itself can be seen). Also, your description that mind itself can be seen also tells me that is not related to anatta, as that itself is a thought (without that you would not know that it is mind you are seeing), which means you are in the identification stage and not (yet) seeing the true nature of things. Observing anatta is seeing the grasping/identification activity in action and noting that that is not me (if it is, then who is the I that is watching it? - hence a contradiction so both are not me in essence). 

Return to the position your body was in while you were actively engaged in a dream, and your recall of the dream can be better. Be on the lookout for reality-oddities in your dreams that trigger your knowledge that "dreaming is happening." One such technique that ended up serendipitously working well for me personally was dying my hair blue in waking life, seeing my reflection in a mirror in a dream, and noticing non-blue hair, thus triggering the lucid catalyst dynamic whereupon one becomes entity and environment. In line with the above, dye your hair in waking life to some funky color. Definitely do breathing exercises and stretches for your whole body before sleeping, or at least at some point in the day. Think wind channels. Perhaps the most important point, kept for the bottom of the list: set a strong intention or motivation as you ramp up your going-to-bed process. It could be like in the above, where @Lanka mentioned the dream yoga stages. 

Self-reflexive awareness is awareness focused on itself. IT has nothing to do with memories or fantasies of past and future, but is knowable only in the precise moment of inspection. Self-reflexive awareness is the natural condition of the mind and is such a profound topic that debate without meditation would be like cooking rice without a fire. Please check this resource for a most excellent write-up, and please be sure to verify the conclusions in your own meditative experience. 

If all the actions that involve volition can happen without volition as well, can volition be assumed to exist and be only under the control of a self ? This is in reference to your question: 

First of all, you don't have to take your life, even if you didn't cure your suffering. There are many escapes available from pointless suffering in this world. You can travel, spend time online or even spend time playing video games etc... But do you want to do that? probably not. And why not ? probably because there is a better alternative available. The possibility of ending suffering. All the issues you have mentioned are solvable. All of these are conditioned and all conditioned things can be ended, the Buddha himself said so. If things are not working for you in your current meditation practice, try to make some alterations (like picking a (different) teacher, changing the method to see what works better for you etc) but continue to practice, as that is the only way to end suffering in this life. May you find peace, May you find your inner happiness! 

The Four Dharma Seals encompass the whole Buddhadharma and are excellent. It brings me joy that you are learning them. You should pretty much give everything, to perfect generosity. However, before you go out and give away your house and all your clothes, you can probably benefit people in greater ways by "setting your intention and being natural" -- one of the Lojong Mind Training verses. (You can read more about Lojong proverbs at this wonderful resource $URL$ Think about, in the simple example, of a man who could use his great wealth to buy many acres of farm land and supply his village with a seemingly endless supply of food. Had he given all his wealth away at once, it might not be as beneficial to sentient beings. So, yes, time is definitely something you should give to other beings. In fact, practicing, studying, reflecting, and meditating can be of the most generous uses of our time, by setting our intentions to ultimately benefit all beings (as numberless as the sky is vast). This setting of intention is called Bodhichitta, it is the "Mind inclined to Awakening" and it is so very very precious. More valuable than all the diamonds and gold and silver. Your question is really wonderful! Our time is valuable, and if we can spend even 10 minutes a day thinking about how we can benefit someone we know, it is time well spent! Also wonderful, is that using your time in the service of others lessens our attachment, and brings us closer to the natural. You can use your time to think about how you can help people you know (or just met) who have similar needs as you. If you know someone without a job, you can try and help them get one, or if you know someone lonely, you can be their friend and really listen and be there for them. You can also spend your time reflecting happily on the good deeds you've done for others. This is also a great way to uplift the mind and ensure that our practice of virtue grows and grows. You can plant great seeds by encouraging the people you know to do the same: to help where help is needed, to think about how we can help others, and to spend our time offering all the wisdom and love we can. 

There is suffering, that is the first noble truth. May be you can contemplate on that, see how it applies to you? Also I'm curious, based on this and your other questions as well, have you diagnosed yourself for ADHD ? I suspect you might have a mild case of ADHD, based on what you have reported - lack of focus, lack of interest in mundane things etc. (If that is the case, I see only two options - you have to find some innermost passion or obsession and use that as a fuel or use stimulant medication) Hope this helps! 

The concept of anatta is hard to get. But the concept of anatta is not same as experiencing anatta. Seeing anatta is to see everything as being made up of constituent parts and lacking any inherent essence. Like seeing forest as nothing but a collection of trees, a chariot as nothing but assembly of related parts put together. And seeing what one thought of as self as made up of various aggregates. If you have such an experience, nothing needs to be done by you. Just the very nature of experience will transform you, redefining the way you view yourself and the way you experience reality. The self/world division disappears as everything is seen as made up of processes/aggregates that are inherently impermanent and without any essence. You cannot do anything anyways as the experience itself will change everything. Ok, what to do if you don't have the direct experience of anatta but know what it means ? Again nothing. The self arises not because you believe in a self, but because the conditions for its arising are present. So the self doesn't go away because you intellectually realise that there is no self, (that would be too easy :) ) it will continue to arise till you have a life changing experience, like experiencing No self, because only that changes the very conditions of its arising. So your worry about changing the way you think is unnecessary. The very meaning of anatta is that you are not in control, just that you have thoughts that you are in control because of belief in self-view. To change the content of your thoughts is not going to make you drop your self-view. You can change it from one form to another, but that will only complicate things. So only thing to do is practice seeing things the way they are, i.e., practice mindfulness and in time things will change of its own accord. 

@ChrisW mentions in a comment that kusala means skillful, so a +kusala would mean the negation of kusala (if you look at how sanskrit works), thus another word may be and it sounds like your meditation friend was trying to expound on what that term actually means. Many words have nuances that can become lost in translation, so sometimes it is good to leave words untranslated, or look at how they were constructed. For example: we could not say "pulsive" as the negation of "impulsive" even though "possible" and "impossible" have the same relationship as "kusala" and "akusala" -- it just depends. Again, good translation, but be open to the idea that not everything need be translated (and thus nuance can be ushered into a new language body and preserved) 

To insist emptiness is the reality without having realized what the words mean brings no benefit.. in order to become realized one must train in both merit/virtues and wisdom. Through gathering the two accumulations of merit and wisdom one can arrive at the perfectly awakened state. What is your question? The entire world is rather magical!
