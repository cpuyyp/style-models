The ratio $E/V$ has no upper bound. Moreover, for every $n\ge 4$ there exists a triangulation of a tetrahedron in $\mathbb R^3$ with $V=n$ and $E=n(n-1)/2$ (so that the edges form a complete graph). To construct such a triangulation, consider a curve $\gamma:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R^4$ defined by $$ \gamma(t) = (t,t^2,t^3,t^4) . $$ Pick $n$ distinct points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ on this curve and let $P$ be their convex hull. It is a 4-dimensional convex polytope. It is easy to see (and well-known) that every segment $[p_ip_j]$ is an edge of this polytope. It follows that all faces of $P$ are simplices. So the boundary of $P$ is a triangulated 3-sphere with $n$ vertices and $n(n-1)/2$ edges. Now a standard construction (the stereographic projection from a point lying outside $P$ near one of its faces) turns the face complex of $P$ into a triangulation of one of its faces. 

A (Euclidean) polyhedral space is a metric space obtained by "gluing together" several (let's assume finitely many) Euclidean simplices (of varying dimensions) by identifying some faces via isometries. In other words, a polyhedral space is a simplicial complex where every simplex is equipped with a Euclidean metric and these Euclidean metrics agree on common faces. Such a space is naturally equipped with the quotient metric (i.e. the maximal metric that does not exceed the original Euclidean metric on every simplex); this makes it a geodesic metric space. Including a simplex in a polyhedral space can make some distances smaller. For example, consider a circle made from two segments of different lengths: the distance between the endpoints of the longer one is smaller in the circle that in the original segment. Let me call a simplex in a polyhedral space convex if this does not happen to it (i.e. the distances induced from the polyhedral space on this simplex are the original Euclidean distances). It is obvious that simplices of the original triangulation can be subdivided into convex ones, isn't it? (For example, one can do sufficiently many barycentric subdivisions.) Unfortunately, this obvious fact is not that easy to prove, and I was not able to locate any source where a proof can be found. (Although it is asserted without proof in several texts that I checked.) Well, I think I know a working plan of a proof, but it would be so long and full of nasty details... So here are my questions: 1) Does this fact (that every polyhedral space admits a subdivision into convex simplices) have a written proof somewhere (or maybe a slick proof that fits in MO)? 2) Is it true that this can be done by iterated barycentric subdivision? ADDED. The existence of a desired subdivision follows from the fact that every polyhedral space admits a piecewise-linear path-isometric map to a Euclidean space. Unfortunately this fact does not seem to be written in citeable sources either. And it does not answer Q2 anyway. 

Yes. Let $A=(A_1,A_2)$, $B=(B_1,B_2)$ and $C=(C_1,C_2)$. For the triangle $A_1B_1C_1$ in the first tree, there is a "center" $M_1$ such that the (unique) geodesics $[A_1B_1]$, $[A_1C_1]$ and $[B_1C_1]$ contain $M_1$. Similarly, there is a "center" $M_2$ for the triangle $A_2B_2C_2$ in the second tree. Let us show that $(M_1,M_2)$ belongs to any convex set $S$ containing $A$, $B$ and $C$. Suppose $A_1\ne M_1$ and $A_2\ne M_2$. Then consider a geodesic $A(t)=(A_1(t),A_2(t))$ connecting $A$ to $B$ in $S$. Its coordinate projections are geodesics in the two trees. Let $A_1(t)$ hit $M_1$ before $A_2(t)$ hits $M_2$ and this first hit happens at $t=t_0$. Replace $A$ by $A'=A(t_0)$. It suffices to prove the assertion for $A'BC$ in place of $ABC$ (note that the centers of the new coordinate triangles are the same points $M_1$ and $M_2$). What we gained is that now one of $A_1$ and $A_2$ coincides with the corresponding center $M_1$ or $M_2$. Repeat this procedure for $B$ and $C$. Now, for each of $A$, $B$ and $C$, one of the coordinate projections is at $M_1$ or $M_2$. So at least two of these projections are at the same point $M_1$ or $M_2$. Assume w.l.o.g. that $A_1=B_1=M_1$. Consider a geodesic from $A$ to $B$ in $S$. Its first coordinate projection is constant $M_1$, and the second one is a geodesic from $A_2$ to $B_2$ that must go through $M_2$ eventually. 

It is NP-complete. Here is a reduction from the graph 3-coloring problem. For a given graph, consider a sphere with $n$ holes where $n$ is the number of vertices. Enumerate the holes by the vertices of the graph. Fill each hole by 3 discs (red, green and blue) by identifying each disc boundary with the hole boundary. Glue the centers of the 3 discs into one point (so that nor two of them cannot be included in one surface), Then, for every edge of the graph, pick one new point in each of the 6 discs filling the holes corresponding to the edge endpoints, and glue together each of the 3 pairs of chosen points lying on discs of the same color. The points chosen for different edges must be distinct. The resulting topological space is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex (which is easy to construct from the graph in polynomial time). It contains a sphere if and only if the original graph is 3-colorable. Remark. You can alter the formulation by saying that an immersed sphere which self-intersects itself in finitely many points is still a sphere. For this problem, the construction can be modified as follows. To make a pair of discs "forbidden", glue together two pairs of small discs in them rather than one pair of point. This creates a surface of positive genus if you try to pick a pair of discs connected this way. 

The specific $F(M)$ is not a smooth submanifold. Here is an argument. To simplify formulas, I renormalize the sphere: let it be the set of $(z_1,z_2)\in\mathbb C^2$ such that $|z_1|^2+|z_2^2|=2$ rather than 1. Then, as Gregory Arone pointed out, $F(M)$ is the set of $(b,c)\in\mathbb C^2$ such that the roots $z_1,z_2$ of the equation $z^2-bz+c$ satisfy $|z_1|^2+|z_2^2|=2$. I claim that it is not a smooth manifold near the point $p:=(2,1)\in F(M)$. Let us intersect $F(M)$ with two planes: $\{b=2\}$ and $\{c=1\}$. If it is is a smooth submanifold, at least one of the intersections should be locally (near $p$) a 1-dimensional smooth submanifold of the respective plane (otherwise both planes are tangent to $F(M)$ at $p$, but this is impossible since they span the whole space). But this is not the case: If $b=2$, the equation is $z^2-2z+c=0$, hence $z_1+z_2=2$, then $|z_1|+|z_2|\ge 2$ and therefore $|z_1|^2+|z_2|^2\ge 2$. Equality is attained only for $z_1=z_2=1$, thus the intersection is a single point $c=1$, not a 1-dimensional submanifold. If $c=1$, the equation is $z^2-bz+1$, hence $z_1z_2=1$, then $|z_1|\cdot|z_2|=1$ and therefore $|z_1|^2+|z_2|^2\ge 2$. The equality is attained if and only if $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, so $z_1$ and $z_2$ are conjugate to each other. The set of $b$'s for which this happens is the real line segment $[-2,2]$ which is not a submanifold near 2. 

Q1: No. Let g(0)=1, g(1)=0 and g(x)=x for all $x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0,1\}$. Assuming $f\circ f=g$, let a=f(0), then f(a)=1 and f(1)=g(a)=a since $a\notin\{0,1\}$. Then g(1)=f(f(1))=f(a)=1, a contradiction. Q2: No. Let $g(x)=-x$ or, in fact, any decreasing function $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$. Then f must be injective and hence monotone. Whether f is increasing or decreasing, $f\circ f$ is increasing. 

The answer is no in dimension 2 and yes in dimension 3 and higher. The property that the nearest-point projection to a line does not increase the norm is equivalent to the symmetry of orthogonality relation defined as follows: $x$ is orthogonal to $y$ iff $\|x+ty\|\ge\|x\|$ for all $t\in\mathbb R$. It is well-known that symmetry of this orthogonality relation in dimension $\ge 3$ implies that the norm is Euclidean, see e.g. Thompson's "Minkowski geometry", Theorem 3.4.10. This is not the case in dimension 2. There are many counter-examples (I believe they are called Radon planes). Basically you only need to ensure that every unit vector with its unit orthogonal one span a constant parallelogram area, this is easy to satisfy and is equivalent to the symmetry of orthogonality. For a simple explicit example (although non-smooth), consider a norm on the plane whose unit ball is a regular hexagon. 

I recently discovered the following fact: Let $K\subset\mathbb R^3$ be an origin-symmetric convex body with smooth and strictly convex boundary. Suppose that all central cross-sections of $K$ (that is, its intersections with planes through the origin) are affine equivalent planar bodies. Then $K$ is an ellipsoid. Equivalently, if we consider the norm in $\mathbb R^3$ defined by $K$, this fact can be restated as follows: If a 3-dimensional normed space (with a smooth strictly convex norm) is such that all 2-dimensional linear subspaces are isometric to one another, then the normed space is Euclidean. My motivations and my proof are from differential geometry, but the fact itself looks like something that might be studied in convex geometry. I know there are many ellipsoid characterization theorems but I could not find this particular one. So the question is: Is the above fact known, and what are appropriate references? If it is known, does it generalize to non-smooth bodies and to higher dimensions? 

Let $D\subset\mathbb R^2\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a unit planar disc in $\mathbb R^n$. Let $S$ be an orientable two-dimensional surface in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $\partial S=\partial D$. Of course, we have $area(S)\ge area(D)$. Assume that $area(S)< area(D)+\delta$ where $\delta>0$ is small. Then $S$ is close to $D$ in the following sense: there is a 3-dimensional surface $F$ filling the gap between $S$ and $D$ such that $volume(F)<\varepsilon(\delta)$ where $\varepsilon(\delta)\to 0$ as $\delta\to 0$ ($n$ is fixed). "Filling the gap" means that $\partial F=S-D$. This fact immediately follows from the compactness theorem for flat norms. But this proof is indirect and does not answer the following questions (I am especially interested in the second one): 1) Are there explicit upper bounds for $\varepsilon(\delta)$? How do they depend on $\delta$ and $n$? 2) Can $\varepsilon(\delta)$ be independent of $n$? Or, equivalently, does the above fact hold true in the Hilbert space? In the unlikely event that 2-dimensional surfaces are somehow special, what about the same questions about $m$-dimensional surfaces, for a fixed $m$? Remarks: "Surfaces" here are Lipschitz surfaces or rectifiable currents or whatever you prefer to see in this context. Rather than talking about the filling surface $F$, one could equivalently say that the integral flat norm of $S-D$ is less than $\varepsilon(\delta)$. 

Answering a sensible question appeared in comments: If a geodesic space is Busemann and CAT(1), then it must be CAT(0). Indeed, CAT(1) implies that the space has well-defined metric angles between geodesic segments. And if a space is Busemann and has well-defined angles, then it is CAT(0). Indeed, let $X$ be the space in question and $\alpha,\beta:[0,1]\to X$ constant-speed minimizing geodesics with $\alpha(0)=\beta(0)=p$. Then, by the Busemann definition, the function $t\mapsto d(\alpha(t),\beta(t))/t$ is non-decreasing. Hence the comparison angle at $p$ of the triangle $p\alpha(t)\beta(t)$ is non-decreasing. Hence its limit at $t=0$ (which is by definition the angle between $\alpha$ and $\beta$) is no greater than the comparison angle at $p$ of the triangle $p\alpha(1)\beta(1)$. This means that Toponogov's hinge comparison holds. It remains to recall that existence of angles plus hinge comparison is one of the standard definitions of CAT(0). 

First of all, the identity holds for any degree 1 map $F:\mathbb S^2\to\mathbb S^2$. Moreover, for any $F=(f,g,h):\mathbb S^2\to\mathbb S^2$, $$ \int_{\mathbb S^2} f\,dgdh = \frac43\pi \deg F. $$ This follows from Stokes' formula. So basically the identity means that the Gauss map of a surface diffeomorphic to the sphere has degree 1. This is by the way not always true, you have to choose $N$ according to the orientation (that you use to define the degree), otherwise you get the value $-\frac43\pi$. In other words, $\phi$ must be orientation-preserving. Back to the question, the answer is trivially yes if $F$ is a diffeomorphism, by Alex Degtyarev's comment. In general, the answer is no because certain types of singularities can not occur. For example, consider $F$ that maps some circle $C\subset\mathbb S^2$ to the north pole but such that the $F$-image of an open disc $D\subset\mathbb S^2$ bounded by $C$ avoids the north and south poles. It is easy to construct such a map of degree 1. Suppose that the desired $S$ and $\phi$ exist and consider the disc $\phi(D)$ in $S$. On its boundary $\phi(C)$ the normal is vertical, hence $\phi(C)$ is contained in some horizontal plane $H$. Then there is a point in the interior of $\phi(D)$ where the tangent plane is horizontal (look at a point furthest from $H$). The normal at this point is vertical contrary to the fact that $F(D)$ avoids the north and south poles. 

No, Let $B_n\in M$ be the $n$-dimensional Euclidean unit ball and $r=\frac12+\varepsilon$ where $\varepsilon=\frac1{100}$. Then the $r$-balls in $M$ centered at $B_n$ intersect pairwise. Indeed, for $m>n$ the $m$-dimensional Euclidean ball of radius 1/2 lies within Gromov-Hausdorff distance 1/2 from both $B_n$ and $B_m$ (as seen from their natural inclusion into $\mathbb R^m$). However there is no compact metric space $K$ which stays within distance $1/2+\varepsilon$ from every $B_n$. Indeed, suppose the contrary, then there is a map $f_n:B_n\to K$ which distorts distances by at most $1+2\varepsilon$. But $B_n$ contains $2n$ points with pairwise distances $\sqrt 2$, hence the $f_n$-images of these points are separated by distances at least $\sqrt2-1-2\varepsilon>\frac1{10}$. Thus $K$ contains arbitrarily many $\frac1{10}$-separated points, hence it is not compact. 

There is a couple of standard methods. First, one can embed $M$ into some $\mathbb R^N$ and fix a smooth neighborhood retraction onto the image. Then let $a$ be the composition of the weighted average in $\mathbb R^N$ and the retraction. Second (this is an extended version of Nikite Kalinin's answer), you can take the barycenter with respect to a Riemannian metric on $M$. For $x_1,\dots,x_n\in M$ and $(m_1,\dots,m_n)\in\Delta_n$, define the barycenter as a point where the function $$ x\mapsto \sum m_i\cdot dist(x,x_i)^2 $$ attains its minimum. Since the square of the Riemannian distance is smooth near the diagonal, and in normal coordinates it has the same first and second derivatives at the diagonal as the Euclidean counterpart, an easy application of the implicit function theorem shows that the barycenter is well-defined and depends smoothly on its arguments in a neighborhood of the diagonal. Moreover the size of the neighborhood can be estimated in terms of the injectivity radius and sectional curvatures of the Riemannian metric. 

I'll address the last question (about an a priori bound for $\epsilon$). If $n\gg k\gg m$, the worst-case bound for $\epsilon$ is between $c(m)\cdot k^{-2/(m-1)}$ and $C(m)\cdot k^{-1/(m-1)}$ (probably near the former but I haven't checked this carefully). Note that the bound does not depend on $n$. Proof. The columns of $A$ form a set $S$ of cardinality at most $n$ in $\mathbb R^m$. For a given $\epsilon$, a suitable $B$ exists if and only if there is a subset $T\subset S$ of cardinality at most $m$ such that the convex hull $conv(T)$ majorizes the set $(1-\epsilon)S$ in the following sense: for every $v\in S$, there is a point in $conv(T)$ which is component-wise greater than $(1-\epsilon)v$. And this majorization is implied by the following: $conv(sym(T))$ contains the set $(1-\epsilon)S$, or equivalently, the set $(1-\epsilon)conv(sym(S))$, where by $sym(X)$ denotes the minimal origin-symmetric set containing $X$, that is, $sym(X)=X\cup -X$. Consider the polytope $P=conv(sym(S))$. We want to find a subset of its vertices of cardinality at most $k$, such that their convex hull approximates $P$ up to $(1-\epsilon)$-rescaling. This problem is invariant under linear transformations, and we may assume that $P$ has nonempty interior. Then Fritz John's theorem asserts that there is a linear transformation of $\mathbb R^m$ which transforms $P$ to a body contained in the unit ball and containing the ball of radius $1/\sqrt m$. For such a set, $(1-\epsilon)$-scaling approximation follows from $(\epsilon/\sqrt m)$-approximation in the sense of Hausdorff distance. So it suffices to choose $T$ to be an $(\epsilon/\sqrt m)$-net in $S$. Then a standard packing argument gives the above upper bound for $\epsilon$. On the other hand, if $S$ is contained in the unit sphere and separated away from the coordinate hyperplanes, you must choose $T$ to be a $\sqrt\epsilon$-net in $S$. This gives the lower bound; the "worst case" is a uniformly packed set of $n=C(m)\cdot k$ points on the sphere. UPDATE. Fritz John theorem, also known as John Ellipsoid Theorem, says that for any origin-symmetric convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^m$, there is an ellipsoid $E$ (also centered at the origin) such that $E\subset K\subset\sqrt m E$. (There is a non-symmetric variant as well but the constant is worse.) The linear transformation that I used just sends $E$ to the unit ball. There are lecture notes about John ellipsoid here and probably in many other sources. Comparing scaling distance (see also Banach-Mazur distance) and Hausdorff distance between convex bodies is based on the following. The scaling distance is determined by the worst ratio of the support functions of the two bodies, and the Hausdorff distance is the maximum difference between the support functions. Once you captured the bodies between two balls, you can compare relative and absolute difference. This should be explained in any reasonable textbook in convex geometry; unfortunately I'm not an expert in textbooks, especially English-language ones. By "packing argument" I mean variants of the following argument showing that for any $\epsilon$, any subset $S$ of the unit ball in $\mathbb R^m$ contains an $\epsilon$-net of cardinality at most $(1+2/\epsilon)^m$. Take a maximal $\epsilon$-separated subset $T$ of $S$, it is always an $\epsilon$-net. Since $T$ is $\epsilon$-separated, the balls of radius $\epsilon/2$ centered at the points of $T$ are disjoint, hence the sum of their volumes is no greater than the volume of the $(1+\epsilon/2)$-ball that contains them all. Writing the volume of an $r$-ball as $c(m)\cdot r^m$ yields the result. This argument gives a rough estimate $$ \epsilon \le (2\sqrt m+1) k^{-1/m} $$ in the original problem (up to errors in my quick computations). To improve the exponent one can consider the $(m-1)$-dimensional surface of $P$ rather that the whole ball.
