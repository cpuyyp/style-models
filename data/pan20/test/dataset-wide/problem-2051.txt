It's acceptable to put anything that you think is relevant on your resume. You want to include details that paint you in a good light, and show that you are a potential employee that the interviewing manager should hire. I've been interviewing and hiring for many years and have never seen this sort of thing on a resume. Frankly, I'm not sure I'd lend much credence to an offer that wasn't accepted. It would be hard to check, and would raise doubts if it was a formal offer, or just one of those typical "look us up when you are ready for a full-time position" offers that most interns get. Perhaps it was an offer at such a minimal salary that it wasn't worth much. The most useful resume items are those where you recently worked at a job which demonstrated skills similar to the job you are applying for. Rejected offers don't really demonstrate much. I suspect your best bet is to simply mention just the internship on your resume and cover letter, and go into the fact that you got an offer of employment from them (and subsequently rejected it) only if the internship topic comes up in your interview. But if you are new to the job force, you may not have anything better than a rejected offer to put on your resume. In that case, something is usually better than nothing. Good luck! 

Leaving a good job is always awkward, particularly leaving your first job. The first time for many things is the hardest - it almost always gets easier as you go on in your career. You were likely thrilled when you landed this job. You were excited that they chose you. You made many friends. You grew professionally. And now you are leaving them behind. But new experiences await - a new job, new friends, new chances to grow. While it feels like things may fall apart in your prior company, that almost never happens. Although you likely have a great network there, a mass-exodus is seldom triggered by one individual's exit when that individual has only been there for two years. If a group of folks leave, you can be comforted that it almost certainly won't be because you left. Sure, whenever anyone leaves others think through and reassess their situation. But if they leave, it's because they saw something lacking themselves, or have found something far more tempting on their own. And good companies can absorb people leaving - it's just part of the normal ebb and flow of business. They will carry on. And perhaps your leaving will open up opportunities for others. When you leave, say goodbye to your coworkers and promise to stay in touch with your personal network. But try to put most of your energies into you new job, you new network, your new friends. Look forward, and not so much backward, and you'll be fine. 

You need to ask your boss about this. Anything else is just a guess, and your boss is the one that gets to decide if your decision to not work on some projects is acceptable or grounds for dismissal. In some companies with many projects it might be fine. If you don't work on one there's plenty of other work to do. In other companies everyone needs to be on board with important projects. 

I've been in a similar situation at a prior company. While it was a different set of technologies, and wasn't email, it was basically a similar "important system migrating to a new technology with a few unhappy/scared/grumbling users resisting". What they did was arrange an additional series of optional lunchtime Learning Sessions specifically for those who were still having a difficult time adjusting even after the normal training sessions. During these 1-hour sessions (and basically only during these sessions) users were encouraged to bring their questions, and have them addressed on a projected screen in front of the group of attendees. This all served several purposes: 

If the purpose of the group isn't being served, due to its composition, then the list should be modified. If this list isn't being used, solely due to the presence of the manager on the list, then yes - remove the manager from the list. Note that it's not all that hard to contact others in your group without using this list. But far, far better would be to get to the source of this fear of the manager's negative view. Perhaps this fear is unfounded? Perhaps you could discuss this with some safe third party in your organization? Perhaps some group-plus-manager team building is in order? 

That's a personal decision. Unless you have a contract forbidding this practice, or there are local laws prohibiting it, I'm not sure how you expect your employer to react to the fact that this practice doesn't sit well with you. If they are operating legally, you don't expect your reaction to prompt them to stop doing this, right? Now that you know this happens, you could leave and attempt to find a company who doesn't/wouldn't do this. Or you could come to grips with the fact that it happens. 

You've only been there 2 months so far. And you aren't willing to wait "several months" to see your concerns "fixed". Again, it sounds like your mind is already made up. 

If you want a raise with your next contract, you need to talk to your employer now. In this case, your employer is the "vendor". You just speak with your boss at the vendor and say "This contract is coming up for renewal in a few months. I really like working there, but for my next contract, I would like $X." Usually, a company has a budget in mind when it seeks out a contractor through a vendor. That rate isn't always firm, so it might be possible that they would be willing to pay more. At the same time, there are many contractors out there - probably available through the same vendor. You are in a position where the company knows your work. If they want to extend your contract, that indicates that they like your work, and probably don't want to bring in a replacement contractor. That works in your favor. When I have hired contractors in the past, I had to get the contract approved by folks higher up in the corporate ladder. It was fairly simple to get the contract extended - as long as the rate didn't change. But if I wanted to increase the rate, I would have to go through another requisition process, and approval process, which was the equivalent of starting over. That meant I always tried to renew at the same rate. That works against you. Asking your vendor for a higher rate could work. Either the company could pay a higher rate, or the vendor could accept a smaller percent of your rate and thus pay you more. Or, your need for a higher rate could mean that this particular position is no longer viable for you, and the vendor must find you a different position. You might find yourself on the bench for a while, waiting for the higher rate position to come along. To sum up, if you want a higher contract rate - start with the vendor you work through.
