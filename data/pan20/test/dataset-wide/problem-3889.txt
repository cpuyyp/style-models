Indeed the primary question is a well-known hard problem. To have a chance to be a polytope, the cellular decomposition should be regular (the closure of an open cell must be a closed cell) and satisfies the lattice property (The intersection of two cells must be a cell - possibly empty). It also needed to be a polyhedral complex - each cell by itself should be combinatorially equivalent to a polytope. These conditions are sufficient for 2-spheres by a fundamental theorem of Steinitz (and also when the number of vertices is at most the dimension plus 4) but not for d-spheres for $d>2$. The smallest examples of polyhedral spheres which are non-polytopal are 3-spheres with 8 vertices. 

I wonder what is known on the following: 1) What is the number $T_k(n)$ of $k$-tuples of (pairwise) edge-disjoint trees $(T_1,T_2,\dots, T_k)$ with $n$ labelled vertices? 2) (harder, it seems) What is the number $S_k(n)$ of subgraphs with $n$ labelled vertices which are union of $k$ (pairwise) edge-disjoint trees? 3) What is the number $R_k(n)$ of $k$-tuples of (pairwise) edge-disjoint trees $(T_1,T_2,\dots, T_k)$ on the set of vertices $[n]={1,2,\dots,n}$ such that $T_i$ is a tree with $n-i$ edges? 4) (Like 2) What is the number $U_k(n)$ of subgraphs with $n$ labelled vertices which are union of $k$ (pairwise) edge-disjoint trees $(T_1,T_2,\dots, T_k)$ on the set of vertices $[n]={1,2,\dots,n}$ such that $T_i$ is a tree with $n-i$ edges? (Added Sept 7, 2017): 5) What is the number $F_k(n)$ of $k$-tuples of (pairwise) edge-disjoint forests $(F_1,F_2,\dots, F_k)$ on the set of vertices $[n]={1,2,\dots,n}$ such that $F_i$ is a spanning forest with $n-i$ edges? 6) Variant on 5): Rooted forests rather than forests. (Call the number $G_k(n)$.) Of course, Cayley's formula for the number of trees on $n$ labelled vertices gives that $T_1(n)=S_1(n)=R_1(n)=U_1(n)=F_1(n)=G_1(n)=n^{n-2}$ but I wonder if something is known even for $k=2$. 

Some of the advances regarding bounded gaps between primes following Zhang's proof were using computers and computations quite substantially. This applies to progress in polymath8, to Meynard's paper, and to progress in polymath8b. See this paper for a general perspective of these advances. 

1) perimeter of planar sets with constant width I like the probabilistic proof that every set of constant width 1 has perimeter pi using Buffon's needle problem. See also the wikipedia article on Buffon's noodle problem. Another beautiful analytic (of a sort) theorem where probability plays an important role is regarding the overhang problem. The description of the problem and the solution is taken from the abstract of the paper "maximum overhang" by Mike Paterson, Yuval Peres, Mikkel Thorup, Peter Winkler and Uri Zwick: 2) Maximum overhang How far can a stack of $n$ identical blocks be made to hang over the edge of a table? The question dates back to at least the middle of the 19th century and the answer to it was widely believed to be of order $\log n$. Recently, Paterson and Zwick constructed $n$-block stacks with overhangs of order $n^{1/3}$, exponentially better than previously thought possible. We show here that order $n^{1/3}$ is indeed best possible, resolving the long-standing overhang problem up to a constant factor. 

I recommend the paper " An elementary core equivalence theorem" by Robert M. Anderson. It is a very short paper that contains a fairly self contained description of the basic models and concepts. You can then try to guess how to prove the existence of equilibrium based on some fixed point theorems or look at papers that Anderson quote. There are various more advanced models including models with incomplete informations ("rational expectation is a useful buzz word). There are also plenty of examples of market failure. (I do not see why the recent financial crisis has anything to do with these models being less hot...) 

It is useful to know the following Erdos-Szekeres fact: For every k > d there is N(k,d) so that every N points in general position in R^d contains k points in "cyclic position". We say that d points $x_1, x_2,...x_d$ are in cyclic position if all the simplices $x_{i_1},...,x_{i_{d+1}}$ have the same orientation. This fact follows from Ramsey's theorem. (With very large N(k,d).) It implies various results of the kind ask here if they refer to properties of points in cyclic positions. This gives a complete answer for the case $k=2$ of the original question. Indeed it is useful to think about the original problem as for which sizes $d_1,d_2\dots,d_k$ whose sum is $(d+1)(k-1)+1$ if N is large enough and we have $N$ points in $R^d$ we can find a subset of $(d+1)(k-1)+1$ points with Tverberg partition of sizes $d_1,d_2,\dots,d_k$. When it comes to Radon partitions points in cyclic position are "cannonical". For larger values of $k$ I dont know the precise situation. We can look at lexicographic sequence of points on the moment curve and this is a property inherited by subsequences. (So it will exclude plenty of $d_i$ sequences.) But I am not sure every large set of points "contains" a lexicographic sequence of points on the moment curve. ("contains" in terms of having equivalent Tverberg's behavior.) So there is more to explore. By the way, an interesting higher dimensional question is what is the number f(n,d) so that every f(n,d) points in general position in $R^d$ contains $n$ points in convex position. This is monotonic non-increasing in $d$. 

In my (first research) paper, A note on evaluation of Abel's sums, (that appeared second, in 1979) I described another way to evaluate Abel's sum of the form $$A_n(x,y;p,q)=\sum_{k=0}^n {{n} \choose {k}}(k+x)^{k+p}(n-k+y)^{n-k+q},$$ via (simpler) auxiliary sums defined by $$F_n(x,y;p,q)=\sum_{k=0}^n {{n} \choose {k}}(-1)^k (k+x)^{p}(n-k+y)^{q}.$$ The $F_n$ functions have simple evaluations in terms of difference operators. I was inspired by Riordan's book Combinatorial Identities and later corresponded with Riordan, and met him in 78. 

This is a interesting question but, in my opinion, are several misguided or at least questionable conceptions: 1) The future is what matters. Scientists should concentrate now on what will have most impact in the very long run. Why is that? I certainly do not agree. 2) The future is clear. Even if you agree with predictions about the Future (like Brendan McKay's prediction which I tend to agree with) you should acknowledge that even a plausible prediction of this kind might be wrong, there are various plausible developments which may be competing, and the time scale is also very unclear and of great importance. 3) Long term projects are most fruitful Even if you do give high weight to long term projects and it is clear to you, say, that computers will have vast impact on mathematics, it is not clear at all that your own efforts in such a direction will be more fruitful than effort in other directions. Long term risky projects more likely fail. 4) It is problematic if non-mathematicians will bring major (or even the major) contribution to future mathematics. It is possible that current non-mathematicians will have major, even dominant, long term contributions to mathematics. What's wrong with that? 5) Mathematicians should mainly concern about ML's impact to mathematics There are more important and more immediate applications of ML which are not to mathematics. This could be as tempting or even more tempting to mathematicians who want to get involve in ML. If you can see how your mathematical ideas could contribute through ML to autonomous driving, go for it! This can be more important than automatic theorem proving. 6) The "math community" allocates its manpower. 7) Impact of mathematics to a new area is measured by current mathematicians working on it. It is probably the case that mathematics and the work of mathematicians in the past (along with statisticians, computer scientists, physicists, ...) had much influence on ML current development. A related thing is: 8) Impact of mathematics to a new area is measured by direct attempts of mathematicians aimed for this area. And finally 9) Mathematicians do not contribute to current ML. I am not sure this is correct. As a matter of fact, I recommend to look at the book Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David to learn more. 

Here are two more candidates for new ways of thinking in proofs but I am not sure about the historical picture. One is Brunn sieve which led to new results in number theory. The other is Kummer's method that have led to proofs of many cases of FLT. (Frey's new way of thinking regarding FLT was already mentioned in a Roy Smith's comment.) 

Branko Grunbaum wrote in 1978 lecture notes called "Lectures on Lost Mathematics" Grunbaum talks about areas of geometry that went "underground". The topics discussed there and Grunbaum philosophical comments (e.g. p. 15 of the pdf file where the original manuscript begins) are quite relevant to the topic of the question. Some topics discussed by Grunbaum were "revived" in some cases because of these lecture notes and in other cases independently. 

I am familiar with unexpected application of a Dvoretzky-type theorem (albeit not Dvoretzly's theorem itself) to the combinatorial theory of convex polytopes. A theorem of Figiel, Lindenstrauss and Milman asserts that for arbitrary centrally symmetric d-dimensional polytopes P that for some absolute constant $\gamma$. $$\log f_0(P) \log f_{d-1}(P)\ge \gamma d.$$ (Here, $f_0(P)$ is the number of vertices of $P$ and $f_{d-1}(P)$ is the number of facets.) This is derived from a similar relation between the dimension of a spherical section of $P$ and that of $P*$. Dvoretzky's theorem asserts that we can find a log d dimensional spherical section and Fiegil-Lindenstraus-Milman proved that we can find a k-dimensional spherical section for $P$ and an m-dimensional spherical section for $P^*$ such that $mk \ge \gamma' d$. I dont know a different proof for this theorem. A famous application of another Dvoretzky-type theorem is the work of Bourgain and Milman on Mahler's conjecture which derive a related inequality based on a theorem of Milman asserting that a spherical subquotients of $\delta d$ dimension always exists.
