I can find little official as to why they play opposite. Many possible reasons exist; the most logical seems simply to make it so the maximum total games can be attended by those who are fans of both teams (I'm sure there are a few), and in particular businesspeople who take out visitors or clients to games are most likely to have a game available to take their clients to. I'm not sure that the other reasons givem by @Braamstruik in the comments really apply to baseball; Shea Stadium and Yankee Stadium are not particularly close, and police presence at baseball games is fairly minimal at most times (compared to the size of the total NYPD force, anyway), though perhaps it is a consideration. Chicago does not have this concept of home and away alternation with its two teams; the Cubs and White Sox regularly play at home on the same day, though they do usually have home openers on different days than each other. The only real discussion I've found online of this topic is articles about the 2013 Home Opener which was for the first time since the 1950s held on the same day for both teams. Reasons for that occurence were that with the 15 team league and interleague play, it was more difficult to keep that aspect of scheduling. As far as the other part of the question; during the period of 1903-1957, there were three teams in New York (the Yankees, the Dodgers, and the Giants), and so they certainly could not have had consistently played a similar schedule, though I imagine they didn't very often have all three playing home dates on the same day (just by coincidence if not by intent). 

After collating the Eagles 2004 Roster with the Eagles 2017-2018 Roster, There were no returning players. The method performed to calculate this was to prioritize the 14 years that have advanced since the 2004 roster. Using this criteria, we can eliminate any players that were over the age of 26 on the 2004 roster due to the striking unlikelihood of any players over the age of 40 still playing other than the Kickers and Punters (both were checked, and both retired before the 2017-2018 season). So, we are left a handful of players 26 or younger from the 2004 roster. Of the 32 players from the 2004 Eagles roster aged 26 or younger, none of them even made it to the 2017-2018 NFL season. In fact, most of the players from that great 2004 team didn't even make it out of the 2000's. 

There isn't a realistic answer, though, for "most cases" that has any meaning. I suspect > 50% of the time, you would find the closer does not come out again, but that's for a variety of reasons. And who they'd go after would vary significantly also - maybe a setup guy, maybe a long innings guy. Maybe a hybrid (TB has a guy right now, Geltz, who could do anything from 1 inning to 3 happily; he's often a 7th inning guy but is likely who they'd go to in the 10th.) 

The game at the University of Hawaii (not Chaminade) on Nov. 18 is likely the source of the 32nd game. From the 2015-16 bylaws (the most recent I can find): 

First, a minor correction in OP's understanding of the grouping In the ATP World Tour Finals with regards to the first two seeds. 

So, based on these witness testimonies and confirmation of them by Wilt himself, we would be with good reason to believe that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk from the foul line and did. 

One possible term to describe this phenomenon is a "Stand-in." The usage for this term is more common in eSports than traditional sports, but it nonetheless holds a similar connotation. 

After watching many Wilt Chamberlain dunk compilations and reading many articles on The Big Dipper, I can say with a large degree of certainty that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk the ball from the free throw line. For the second question, if by "proof" the OP means "video evidence" then I'm afraid it simply cannot be found if it even exists. On the other hand, in terms of proof, a strong case can be built that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk from the foul line via Witness Testimony and Wilt's Self Proclamation. On November 28th, 1956 the "Toledo Blade" (a Northwestern Ohio newspaper) published this article which details the "Big Seven" conference's 2 rule changes based on then sophomore Wilt chamberlain: 

Here is a second chart; the same data as above, but smoothed using an Exponential Weighted Moving Average. This weights nearer years higher; I used an 0.3 decay exponent, which I found recommended by one of the developers of my software. This is a bit more interesting. Here you see for most years a similar level; there is a bit of a dropoff around 1999 that is either due to the flakiness of 1999 data or an actual year with few kick returns for touchdowns. Beyond that, you see very similar numbers until 2010's drops start being accounted for in the moving average and the blue bars drop off dramatically. 

The article is based on a source-less example which narrates Chamberlain's "unorthodox" free throws: 

Tex Winter (a rival coach at Kansas state) seems to affirm Wilt's ability to dunk from the foul line by stating: 

Although this may put the definition of "professional" in question, there exists a North American club team that's existence does date before the Cincinnati Red Stockings. Some lesser known history, there exists a sport in North America that has been around for many centuries. That sport is lacrosse. Believed to have originally been played by the Native American Iroquois people, historians have traced the general sport of lacrosse back to the 1100's.1 The game was predominately played by those Native American people in what would become the North-Eastern United States, and lower parts of Ontario and Quebec. Explorers and missionaries have recorded details about the game as early as 1637.2 As time wore on, the people of Canada grew fond of the game and began to play it themselves. According to the "Canadian Encyclopedia": 

If you mean any ATP tournament (and not the overall Finals), Aaron Krickstein won an ATP World Tour tournament in Tel Aviv in 1983 at the age of 16 years 2 months, the youngest to do so according to his wikipedia page (which cites a book with that information). I don't see any other source that disagrees, and he's still listed in Wikipedia as the youngest top 10 in the ATP rankings, so that seems likely. 

This isn't clearly stated in the rulebook. This differs from some high school rulesets, from my understanding (though I'm not a high school expert); some of those do have explicit rules for this happening (as I expect it happens more often). In the NFL, all of the rules are based on "when the ball is kicked", such as in 6.1.2: 

They enjoyed it so much that a few decades later in 1856, enthusiasts banded together and formed Canada's first ever lacrosse club the "Montreal Lacrosse Club." 3 Now, it was around this time that the Prince of Wales traveled to Canada and grasped the merit of holding sporting exchanges between Britain and Canada. As a result, tours began developing in Britain pitting the Native American Khanawake players from Montreal against white gentleman amateurs from Scotland, Ireland, and England.4 It was then, in 1867, that one of the first ever "professional" sports teams/ clubs was formed. The Montreal Lacrosse club, then led by team captain W.B Johnson, began organizing matches in the British nations primarily as a profit making enterprise. The team was comprised of 16 Khanawake players who were each paid $25 dollars for their play (roughly $1600 dollars today).5 Given OP's qualification of "professional" as " (a team) that paid its players as professionals." These Khanawake players would've fit the category. As for the club still being in existence it is complicated. The club itself is not in operation like the Boston Red Socks are, but it exists in an almost ceremonial way. This article outlines the 150 year anniversary of the Montreal Lacrosse Club's existence. The anniversary was celebrated by an exhibition game between the sports two oldest clubs, one of which being Montreal Lacrosse Club. So yes the club is still in existence, but does not operate as team which is comprised of players who are paid a salary by it. Sources: 

While the defender may not flagrantly attempt to injure an opponent's hand, if a defender bats at the ball to attempt a steal and contacts only the hand (not the forearm) of the ballcarrier while it is in contact with the ball, a foul will not be called. 

After a pickoff it is certainly possible that the runner might ask for time and the umpire might grant it, but if the runner on second or third was in the process of attempting to advance, the umpire should not grant it. 

But it's pretty clear that it's not cheating, and it's not something that's unexpected in this day and age:
