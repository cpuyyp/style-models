I have checked this up to $x=50$ and for each such $x$ the $c(j,x)$ are positive and unimodal. For instance, for $1\leq x \leq 20$, the coefficients are: [1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4, 4], [1, 5, 5], [1, 4, 6], [1, 5, 7], [1, 6, 12, 8], [1, 6, 13, 9], [1, 5, 13, 10], [1, 6, 15, 11], [1, 6, 13, 12], [1, 7, 15, 13], [1, 6, 15, 14], [1, 5, 15, 15], [1, 6, 20, 30, 16], [1, 7, 23, 33, 17], [1, 7, 21, 32, 18], [1, 8, 24, 35, 19], [1, 8, 22, 34, 20]. 

It is claimed on it's Wikipedia page that Euler's function, defined by the infinite product $\prod_1^\infty(1-q^n)$ for $|q|<1$, cannot be analytically continued outside the unit disc, that is, the unit disc is a natural boundary of the function. Unfortunately no proof is referred to. I would like to know how this claim is proved, as it appears to me that it is defined uniquely for $|q|>1$. 

There are several recent results on non-trivial bounded functions $f$ that are orthogonal, i.e. $$\sum_{n\leq x} \mu(n)f(n)=o(x),$$ to the Mobius function $\mu(n)$. These include the results of Green and Tao on Nilsequences (which includes information on the history of the problem) and Green on bounded depth circuits. The lecture notes by Peter Sarnak on Mobius randomness is an interesting overview of the subject. Sarnak mentions there that it is easy to construct counter examples, or examples which decay very slowly. Of course, its easy to do so if $f$ is sparsely supported or has partial sums that are the inverse Mellin transform of a function having positive powers of $\zeta(s)$ as factors. 

I must point out that I am not suggesting these observations actually have any bearing on our understanding of the truth of the hypothesis. I am just wondering if anyone has investigated the behaviour of the Cesaro sum to a degree of accuracy that could possibly reveal divergence in the simplest imaginable case. 

The answer is that $l=0$, so the power series does not converge. This is not necessarily because there are poles arbitrarily close to the critical line yet not on it; it is because there are, somewhere on the critical line, poles that are arbitrarily close together. Indeed, Littlewood has shown that the sequence of differences of the imaginary parts $(\gamma_n)$ of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, that is, the sequence $|\gamma_{n+1}-\gamma_{n}|\rightarrow 0$. Thus, since there are infinitely many zeros, there are infinitely many $\rho$ such that $$\limsup\sqrt[n]{|l_n(\rho)|}>C$$ for any positive constant $C$, so the sequence $s(n)$ is unbounded. I should add that my statement that the radius of convergence of the power series measures only horizontal distance was clearly incorrect. 

It is not clear to me what the level of difficulty of this problem is but it appears to involve questions about notions of randomness in number theory, and so it seems like a reasonable MO question. The motivation here comes from considering the Dirichlet series $$\sum_1^{\infty}\frac{d(n)}{n^s}\sum_{q|n-1:q\leq X}1,$$ and looking at the value of (the analytic continuation of-) this function at $s=0$. Such Dirichlet series are related to questions about the autocorrelation of the divisor function, for which the asymptotics were worked out by Ingham and Estermann in the 1920's and 1930's. The objective is to obtain an asymptotic formula for the sum $$S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\frac{1}{\phi(q)}\sum_{\chi}L^2(0,\chi),$$ and it can easily be shown that determining this is equivalent to knowing something interesting about Farey fractions. It is fairly elementary that \begin{eqnarray}\label{} S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\frac{1}{\phi(q)}\sum_{\chi} \left( \sum_{a\leq q} \chi(a)\zeta\left(0 ,\frac{a}{q}\right) \right)^2 \end{eqnarray} where $\zeta(s,a)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function so, denoting by $a^*$ the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $q$, expanding out the square and using the orthogonality relations for the Dirichlet characters one obtains $$S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{a}{q}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a^*}{q}-\frac{1}{2}\right).$$ Noting that the mean value of the non-trivial Farey fractions ($0$ and $1$ being trivial) is $1/2$ for all $X$, at this point one probably realises that $S(X)/X^2$ is proportional (by a factor of $3/\pi^2$) to the correlation of the non-trivial Farey fractions of order $X$ with their multiplicative inverses modulo their denominators. Since one would expect the values of $a/q$ and $a^*/q$ to be independent as $q\rightarrow\infty$, one would expect that $$S(X)=O(X^{1+\epsilon})$$ and so I would like to pose the following question: 

I have currently started a new research line aiming to prove a mapping between a 2-symbol Turing machine and the one dimensional Ising model. The connection is seen by recognizing that a set of symbols on the tape of the machine is indeed a configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model. The relevance of this connection relies on the fact that a limit on the entropy for information has been conjectured by Rolf Landauer in the '60. A mapping between a Turing machine and the Ising model can make this conjecture a theorem. My question here is what are the main references on Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machine and so on? Does it exist any standard, research level, literature to consider? Especially for probabilistic Turing machines, does it exist some result making them equivalent to a deterministic Turing machine and, in any case, there exists a theorem stating they can compute anything a deterministic Turing machine can? Thanks. 

The best way to proceed is to use Legendre polynomials through the formula $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2yx+x^2}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(y) x^n. $$ In this way you will get closed form integrals with the error function. 

I think your formula is not correct. The right kernel is invariant by interchanging $x$ with $y$. This symmetry must be preserved. Then, note that $$ L=-\Delta+ax^2+bx=-\Delta+a\left(x+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4a} $$ and this operator is invariant for translations. This means that the kernel for $b\ne 0$ can be obtained from the kernel for $b=0$ by translation of a shift $\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}$ and multiplying for the overall factor $e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}$. Once this is observed, we can consider the kernel for $b=0$, just the argument of the exponential, to be $$ S_0(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[(x^2+y^2)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t-\frac{xy}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right] $$ and apply the above translation to get $$ S(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[\left(x^2+y^2+(x+y)\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t\right. $$ $$ \left.-\frac{1}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\left(xy+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}(x+y)+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\right] $$ and this gives the right kernel $$ K(x,y;t)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\pi\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right)^\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}e^{-S(x,y;t)}. $$

There is no change into the probability distribution due to the absolute value. The reason can be traced back on the Ito's lemma applied to the derivation of the (Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability distribution: This will depend on $\sigma^2$. 

In order to iterate, you have to substitute the second equation into the first one. So, $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)n_{11}(y_1,z). $$ This equation is generally the starting pointing for an iterative procedure, the main tool of perturbation techniques. E.g., you can choose for the first iterate $n_{11}(x,z)=1$ and you will get $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1) $$ $$ +\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)\int_{-\infty}^{y_1}dy_2e^{-izy_2}u(y_2)\int_{-\infty}^{y_2}dy_3e^{izy_3}{\bar u}(y_3)+\ldots. $$ You can stop the procedure at any desired order to get an approximation to the solution of the integral equations. Then, you put this approximation to $n_{11}$ back into the equation for $n_{12}$ and you will get an approximate solution for it at the given order. 

This is a typical problem of special relativity. The next best choice is a constant acceleration $a$ providing $V(x)=ax$. This has the well-known solution $$x = d+ \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{1+ a^2 t^2}$$ being $d$ a constant, that is unbounded as required. 

As OP seems to be stuck, I give here the few lines needed to solve this problem as sugested in the comments. Given $$ f(\mathbf{r})=\int_{\Omega }d^2k\int_{\Omega }d^2q \cos[(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q})\cdot\mathbf{r}]= \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} +\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}. $$ These integrals are easily done to give $$ f(\mathbf{r})=4\frac{(1-\cos(\pi x))(1-\cos(\pi y))}{x^2y^2} $$ from which the asymptotic behavior can be readily gotten. This makes clear that the question is not appropriate here. 

This isn't a research level mathematics question, but you do have to do a bit of high school calculus. Since $y\log(2/y)$ is strictly increasing and $k(a-y)\log(2/(a-y))$ is strictly decreasing on $(0,a)$, dividing the l.h.s by the r.h.s, differentiating twice and setting the result to $0$ should give you the unique point where the curves meet. EDIT: This is incorrect (or at least it only holds for $k=1$, which trivially gives you the mid-point) because the inflection point is unchanged by the constant $k$. Apologies. Speaking of arcane special functions! the $q$-digamma function function might be of some use: $$\frac{d}{dz} \log\Gamma_q(z)=-\log(1-q)+\log(q)\sum_{0}^{\infty}\frac{q^{n+z}}{1-q^{n+z}}.$$ 

Using some basic facts about Euler products it follows that $S(x)\in O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$, $\epsilon>0$, but can $\epsilon$ be replaced by something explicit? 

Do these bounds together imply that those $s$ with property $P$ belong to subset that is asymptotically smaller than $S$ itself? What geometric tools are used to conclude this is the case if so? 

I am interested in those $s\in S$ which also have a particular property $P$ say, and it turns out that for this subset one also has: 

I expect that this question is an elementary exercise in combinatorics, so hopefully somebody who knows more than me can explain. Specifically, if $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $$f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_nx^n,$$ one obviously has $$f^m(x)=\sum_{n=m}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{k_1+k_2+\cdots + k_m=n}a_{k_1}a_{k_2}\cdots a_{k_m}\right)x^n.$$ The number of distinct products appearing in the iterated convolution is the integer partition number $p(n-m)$ so, writing the inner sum as (1) $$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots + mj_m=n}s_{n}(j_1,j_2,...,j_m)a^{j_1}_1a^{j_2}_2\cdots a^{j_m}_m,$$ the questions arise: What is the coefficient sequence of integers $s_{n}(j_1,j_2,...,j_m)$, explicitly? What is its combinatorial significance? EDIT: The fact that the number of terms in the sum is $p(n-m)$ is perhaps not so obvious, but you can reason as follows: note that the largest subscript that can appear in the coefficient of $x^n$ is $n-m+1$, because $n-m+1+(m-1)\times 1=n$. This restricts you to having only those partitions of $n$ whose largest part is $m-n+1$, that is, the set of solutions to the diophantine equation (2)$$ j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m+1)j_{n-m+1}=n.$$ On the other hand, since there are a total of $m$ coefficients in each product (counting repetitions), you know that (3)$$j_1+j_2+\cdots +j_{n-m+1}=m.$$ Thus, subtracting (2) from (1), you get $$j_2+2j_3+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m+1}=n-m,$$ the number of distinct solutions to which is the partition number $p(n-m)$. I am trying to think of a better notation for the summation in (1), as I think it is definitely misleading. EDIT: I should've indexed everything by $+1$ so that (1) becomes $$\sum_{j_1+2j_2+\cdots +(n-m)j_{n-m}=n-m}s(j_1,j_2,...,j_{n-m})a_1^{m-(j_1+\cdots +j_{n-m})}a_2^{j_1}\cdots a_{n-m+1}^{j_{n-m}}.$$ 

Let $Li_s(z)$ denote the usual polylogarithm. The elementary functional equation $$Li_{-n}(z)=(-1)^{n-1}Li_{-n}(1/z)$$ holds for $n\geq 1$. I remember only that the proof used some reproducing property of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. This functional equation is rather useful because, taking linear combinations, it amounts to saying that a meromorphic function having a power series on the open unit disc whose coefficients are the values of a polynomial $f$ of degree $d$ evaluated at integer arguments: $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}f(k)z^k=\frac{1}{(1-z)^{d+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{d}\left(\sum_{j=0}^k{d+1\choose j}(-1)^jf(k-j)\right)z^k$$ is defined for $|z|>1$ by the series $$-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f(-k)z^{-k}.$$ 

Some time ago I read part of a book in which the author made some conjectures outlining what kind of zero distribution is expected for functions representable by Dirichlet series with completely multiplicative coefficients in some half plane, based on statements about non-zero value distributions. Unfortunately I forgot the author's name, and have not found the book since. The connection outlined was something along the lines of:
