As @ChrisW linked above, there are many representations of the Buddha in his emaciated state, such as and . From the book Buddhist Art and Architecture by Robert E. Fisher, a brief mention of this style of portraying the Buddha is found on page 47 when discussing contrast between Roman and Indian styles of portraying the Buddha in art in the Gandhara region where Alexander the Great had just ended his campaign. 

Kwan Yin (a.k.a. Guanyin, Avalokiteśvara) is an important figure in Mahayana Buddhism. But I recently noticed a statue of Kwan Yin on the grounds of a local Theravada monastery. I looked up Kwan Yin on Wikipedia and a connection to Theravada Buddhism wasn't clear, but the article did list translations of her name in Thai and Sinhalese; both areas where Theravada Buddhism is predominant. I also saw mention of a statue of Avalokiteśvara listed in a very old guide to Bodhgaya. Is this figure part of early Buddhism? Or simply beloved by many? 

Sometimes people feel sad. Sometimes the thing that makes people sad is not getting something they want or getting something they don't want. There is a way not to be so sad about not getting what you want or getting something you don't want. The way is to not think so much about what you want at all, but instead think about how you can be kind and helpful to your family, your teachers, your friends, other people, animals, bugs, and everything that lives. :) 

I believe this to be an example of a practice of learning to attain wisdom, as it's known in the Buddhist tradition, outside of Buddhism. 

When I asked this question, I did not have a good understanding of how fundamental making merit is to Buddhist practice. So it was interesting to look further into it myself. 

In addition to the excellent answers already given, it's important to also keep in mind the effect of one's actions on oneself. So even if the lie you told had no ill effect on the interviewer or company for which you were applying for a job; (say for example, they didn't hire you anyway), you still know you stated something untrue and that stays with you. We work to keep our sila good (by following the 5 precepts) because of the good it does for our own minds. 

A well known way of practicing metta is to start out by wishing that we ourselves will be well, happy, free from harm, etc. We then wish that someone we care deeply about will be well, happy, free from harm, etc. We then wish someone we feel neutrally about will be well, happy, free from harm, etc. We then wish for someone we dislike to be well, happy, free from harm, etc. And from there we may included good wishes for everyone in a small geographic area, then everyone in a larger geographic area, and eventually building up to everyone in the cosmos. So it's a building process; you ease into it rather than starting out trying to summon up benevolence for someone who is very challenging for you to feel benevolent towards. This takes some time and regular practice. The benefit of metta is that it helps dissolve greed (jealousy), aversion (hatred), and ignorance in you, yourself. We shouldn't think that any category of beings are outside of our capacity to "wish them well". When a person is acting with extreme hatred and delusion, they are not well mentally and wishing them well is a way of wishing for mental clarity for them so that they will not continue to act in hatred and delusion. If there is any doubt that we should include those acting in hatred and delusion in our wishes for well being for all, there is the fascinating story of Angulimala, a serial killer back in the Buddha's day who became an Arahant. Here is an audio link to the style of metta meditation described in this post. $URL$ 

The four tetrads correspond to The Four Frames of Reference referred to above. They are (in Pali and English): 

Maha Pajapati and 500 other women shaved their heads, donned yellow robes, and walked to where the Buddha was. Ananda went to the Buddha on their behalf to ask for their permission to join the sangha, but the Buddha's response was "“Ananda, please do not ask so.”. Some of the considerations and concerns that might have been present include the fact that: 

Is there more to this association or was the simple utterance of that verse so long ago the sole reason for believing that Budai was the bodhisatta? 

In the booklet "Women in Buddhism - Questions and Answers" by Chatsumarn Kabilsingh Ph.D., this question is answered in some detail with a comparison of the monks and nuns Pāṭimokkhas. This quote shows where a large amount of the difference lies: 

Again, this explains the monks' rule regarding alcohol. Regarding laypeople and the 5th precept, I'm not sure I understand your meaning of the significance of something having been created "later by the Buddha". Perhaps a Buddhist scholar could identify the timeline of the 5 precepts; but my simple way of thinking of it is that they were created by the Buddha during his lifetime and whether it was in the first years of his teachings or the last; it was a valuable teaching to help lay people make their lives simpler (less suffering) by avoiding bad deeds. And avoiding alcohol is helpful for many people to stay mindful enough to observe the other 4 precepts. Whether observing the 5th precept means avoiding even a drop of alcohol or just avoiding drunkenness or "heedlessness" by laypeople varies by tradition. 

Exercise can be healthy or delusional according to your intentions. If you believe that bodies can be beautiful and having a beautiful body (or a body that is somehow different than it is) will bring you true happiness; than that doesn't really accord with true happiness in Buddhism. If you're trying to stay healthy to have the energy and vigor to study and practice with ardor, what could be wrong with that? Unless you go overboard and lose your wholesome intention of course. One thing about sitting at work; see if you can possibly switch up your work station to stand. I did this 10 months ago and it feels very energizing. (I'd rather spend my sitting time on a mat at home!) If your employer is open to the idea, some creative re-arranging of your work station might be easier than you think. Best wishes. 

I attended a meditation event that included morning and evening chanting at a Theravada monastery/temple. It was a wonderful event but I couldn't follow the chanting book as it was written in Lao characters. I recognized some basics like taking refuge and eight precepts, but other than that I was lost. Does morning and evening chanting follow a set pattern or does each monastery just pick out what they like? If it is a set pattern, what might it include? I'd like to print out some in Pali/English if possible. Thanks for any help. 

Actions taken with wholesome intentions such as these, from the same book, can be considered good actions: 

Sarcasm is a type of humor and humor can be very unwholesome. What people are often trying to achieve with humor is to bring attention to themselves and make themselves look superior while making someone else look inferior. (There are other situations where someone is just trying to diffuse stress or lighten the mood; maybe by being self deprecating; which is not cruel.) Before I began meditating regularly, I enjoyed watching comedy routines, giving quick sarcastic responses, and the feeling that my friends and I were very witty and smart. At this time, I see the cruelty and wrong speech far more in many types of humor and try to avoid being involved in it. It may not be a bad thing that you "don't get" sarcasm. Maybe that says something about the wholesomeness of your mind states. But to go so far as to judge someone else as telling a lie or having wrong speech isn't helpful to you. Slowing down and not reacting to such unskillful responses to your sincere questions may possibly cause the sarcastic person to feel uncomfortable enough to say "just kidding" and give you the real answer you needed. But if not, you can just say "ok, thanks" and move on to the next person who might be a little more helpful. In my tradition, we just note "hearing, hearing" and try not to react to the aspects of what we are hearing, such as cruelty in this case.
