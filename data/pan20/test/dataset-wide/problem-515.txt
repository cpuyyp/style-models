For example, if your position is too now and short for your anatomy you may compensate in various ways, one way can be go flex your thoracic spine such that you start to affect breathing mechanics. If this goes on too long your body can start to permanently change your breathing patterns, where you start to rely on secondary muscles to breath, rather than the primary muscles. These muscles will fatigue more easily which could lead to cramping and the inability to breath under heavy efforts. You suggested your fit was good “on paper”. I would also be careful of trusting "standardized" fits, especially fits based only on body height. Everyone's body proportions are quite different. For example, if you have relatively long legs, you will have a relative short upper body for your height. The longer inseam effectively reduces any frames stack height and while the shorter upper body makes the frame reach effectively longer. Upper to lower arm/leg proportions also vary by up to 30% in people which can further affect fit. It is easier to ride a lower stack height with longer upper arms, while longer lower arms extend the reach and requires a higher stack height in a road bike setup). Personally, I have a long inseam and long lower arms, this requires a much taller stack and longer reach than would be expected for my height. Prior to that I often rode a position that had too low of a stack height and too short of a reach, this caused me to compensate by excessively rounding my back in the thoracic region, which started to impact my breathing mechanics slowly over time. At one point as I would inhale my diaphram would only come part way down, then lock in place followed by breathing "up" (i.e., apical breathing). I ended up getting muscle spasms in my intercostals and at the top of my rectus abdominis right near the rib cage. The solution was to raise my stack by a 1-2 inches (due to having about 2 inches longer inseam) and extending my reach by over an inch for my longer arms. This ended up straightening my back more which opened up my breathing greatly. I also had to work on gaining back thoracic flexibility and retrain my breathing mechanics. My final position did not differ much in aerodynamics because I am more stretched out. You may wish to get assessed by a professional as you may be unwittingly compensating for less than optimal fit by impacting your breathing mechanics. 

Kinda, maybe, sort of... its complicated You could use a Shimano 7 speed derailleur with a 9 speed shifter, if you also used a wheel with a 9 speed cog. The 7 and 9 speed Shimano derailleurs use the same derailleur ratio of 1.7 (amount of derailleur movement for a given cable pull) despite the two systems having different cable pulls (2.9 and 2.5 respectively) and sprocket pitches (5.00 and 4.35 respectively). If you used a 7 speed cassette, with a 9 speed shifter and 7 speed derailleur you would not pull enough cable and the shifts will get mangled. If you are currently on 7 Speeds, this means you have a 7 speed wheel that will most likely NOT take a 9 speed cassette. This would mean you would need to buy a new rear wheel as well as a new 9 speed cassette in order to keep you 7 speed rear derailleur. You would also need a 9 speed chain (which is narrower) to mesh with the 9 speed cassette, which may or may not work okay with your 7 speed chain rings. For pull ratios see $URL$ 

I suspect the jockey wheels are the culprit. You said you lubed the jockey wheels without removing them. Likely the bearings or bushings didn't get lubed sufficiently this way. Typically you will need to remove them and clean and lube the bushing or pry the dust shield off of the bearing so you can clean and lube the cartridge bearing (depending o the derailleur). If you are dealing with a cartridge bearing you need to take care when prying of dust shields so you don't damage them. When reassembling the derailleur ensure you use loctite (blue 242) so that the derailleur doesn't do a RUD (Rapid Unplanned Disassembly) at a later point in time. 

Either or both imply you are operating the brake outside of the intended design parameters, which means that the functioning can be negatively affected. Adjusting pad engagement by using the adjustment knobs on caliper keeps the caliper brake arm in the same relative position regardless of pad wear thereby maintaining brake function throughout the life of the pad. 

Before you start looking at bike setup/fit and/or different bike parts I would get your flexibility assessed. With one knee deflecting nearly a 1/2 foot more than the other, this suggests either underlying flexibility issues or functional issues. A bike fit can help to some degree to mitigate the issue, but a good fitter will also tell you that modifying bike fit is no substitute for fixing any underlying flexibility/functional issues. Knees do not take kindly to off angle loads, in fact neither do most the joints in our legs and hips. Often flexibility issues can cause us to modify our pedal stroke to compensate, including knee deflection, which can lead to repetitive stress injuries. Do you sit down a lot for work? This combined with cycling can really do a number of hip joint flexibility, which can have far reaching functional ramifications outside of just cycling depending on how your body compensates for any lack of flexibility. Do you have a regular stretching routine? If so, good. If not you might need to consider this (especially hip and hamstring flexibility) as part of your regular routine. Do you release muscle adhesion (and potentially muscle shortening) in your legs? - Sometimes referred to as muscle knots, these can also affect range of motion and therefore realized flexibility. Self-message (e.g., leg rollers) can be used to release these. IMS treatment also works well. 

Tires wear out based on tread thickness, compound, tire width and mileage. Tires that you have to replace less often have tread and casings that are thicker and less supple, offering a rougher ride and requiring more effort to pedal. Touring tires will offer the best longevity at the cost of experience (they are noticeably slower to pedal). Larger volume supple tires (there are a few now) are a good compromise as they are fast, offer superior comfort and all else equal larger volume tires wear out less quickly than smaller volume tires. Rims can require replacement due to wearing out the brake track (rim brakes) or damage (e.g., hitting a large hole with insufficiently inflated tires). A lot of road bikes in all four outlined categories come with disc brakes. As the disc is what wears under braking (and can be replaced), disc wheels can theoretically last indefinitely if you do not damage them. Running a larger volume tire will reduce the chance a errant pot hole will damage a rim. Finally, wheel longevity can also be affected by bearing type. Cartridge bearing wheels could also provide some better longevity compared to cone and cup arrangements if you adverse to maintenance. Cup and cone require periodic maintenance, that if missed for extended periods, can result in permeant damage to bearing races. This can be a problem if the damaged race is the one that is part of the wheel hub. Alternatively, a damaged cartridge bearings can simply be removed and replaced, which can be hard to do at home, but most local bike shops should be able to do without issue.

Honestly, as an amateur cyclist I would suggest focusing on learning how to pace a climb first over more finer details such as cadence. Many amateur typically go out too fast on a climb, go anaerobic, accumulate a lactate debt, then find themselves suffering terribly the remainder of the climb. This gives most the idea the climbs are harder than they could be. Ideal, you want start easier, settle into a sustainable pace, and only max out your effort at the top of the climb. This can take practice. I would err on the side of going too easy for the whole climb. See how that feels. Next time you do the climb try upping the effort a bit. Keep doing this until you find yourself blowing up on the climb... congratulations you found your aerobic threshold. Next time you will know to back off a bit and this will be pretty much your max sustainable pace. In terms of cadence, try different gears until you find one that feels good. When left to their own devices people tend to self select a suitable cadence for their training and muscle coordination. (I am sure there are exceptions to this, but once people learn how to change gears many do a good job of self-selecting an appropriate cadence.) Higher cadence climbing tends to be a technique to "save" your legs for later hard efforts like sprinting (i.e., you are trying to avoid tapping your fast twitch muscle fibres on the climb, these fibres are what drive short hard efforts). This trade-off can be important if you are racing, less so if you are a causal rider. (Unless you are riding with friends and there are fish signs sprints - it can be important to be at your best so you can win all the beer!) Anyway, I digress... Fast cadence climbing is a technique that has to be trained. If you do all your riding at a slow cadence, you will not have efficient muscle coordination for climbing at a fast cadence. I personally found things like fast paced club rides a natural place to hone the fast cadence riding style. Training it on your own might be a bit tedious and boring, but can be done. Strangely, enough lower cadence climbing may actually be more efficient in terms of oxygen consumption (i.e., cardio-respiratory system work; see Determinants of “optimal” cadence during cycling). This is consistent with the idea of "saving" your legs, where you are stressing your cardiovascular system a bit more in order to try and reduce some of the stress on the muscular system. 

I suspect marketing. More is always better. If you were naive to bikes and you saw two derailleur bikes for $499: One with 9 gears (1 x 9) or one with 27 gears (3 x 9). Which do you think they will choose? In western society, more is always and without question better. The single chainring bike might have better components (due to being simpler at the same price point), but people will fixate on the number of gears. That said, I have noticed quite a few 8 speed hub internal hub bikes on the market now. Single chain ring with essentially the same number of gears as a single chainring derailleur bike, but they can do a marketing end run around the issue of number of gears with a different sell, namely the reduced maintenance and simplicity associated with an internal hub. Aside - I will avoid any discussion of whether or not internal hubs are simpler and lower maintenance, just that this is the common "knowledge" about internal hub bikes. 

It is likely the temperature change combined with imperfections in your rotor. No rotor is perfectly straight, all will have a slight deviation from centre. The colder weather can make metal contract, which can exacerbate any imperfections, and could cause the rotor to start interacting with the brake pad as you ride. The squeak can come from an on/off interaction that can happen if only one part of the rotor touches the pad. 

The answer is less "can" it take the wheel (yes it can physically fit) but more an issue of safety. Misapplication of a quick release (QR) can happen. If the QR is not tightened properly the constant vibration experienced riding off road can cause it to loosen further. Older forks may be missing "lawyer lips" (little tabs at the bottom of the drop out) that can help keep the wheel in the drop outs in the situation that a QR does loosens off. I have personally had a QR back off under very rough conditions. The wheel rattled about but did not come off. I was very grateful for the lawyer lips. I don't consider myself "stupid" either for the misapplication, in my case it was one of those crappy Bontranger QR's that never seem to engage well. 

BMX was originally (and still is) run on smooth dirt track that have obstacles such as jumps and whoops (also know as the rhythm sections). Because the tracks are smooth a small fully rigid bike works amazingly well when ridden appropriately. The BMX bike and track evolved together emphasizing a riding style that is about timing and body position. All of this took off in around the mid-70's just as Mountain biking was in its infancy with the Repack rides. The end result is that BMX bikes are really the optimal form factor for BMX tracks. For example, whoops are a series of smooth small mounds that are typically part of a track's rhythm section. By pulling back and up on the bike as you approach the crest and pushing down on the downside you can actually gain speed through this section without pedalling. If you can continue pedalling while doing so you can gain even more speed. Some advanced riders may even jump some or all the whoops, others may manual or wheely through. The commonality, is controlling your center of gravity so that you body position changes as little as possible while moving the bike over the terrain. Similarly jumps have smooth lead ups and transitions. Learning body position, timing and pumping are some of the techniques used to ensure you land smoothly on the transitions on the backside of each jump. Good riders will look like they never stop pedalling from when they leave to when they land on the transition. Advanced riders also do some other pretty impressive things such as rear wheel dabs mid-flight to help control their flight paths and where they will land. Speed and smoothness is the goal in BMX dirt track racing. Because the tracks are so controlled, once the various skills are learnt a small rigid bike like a BMX bike is literally the fastest way around the track. Starting in the 90's many BMX clubs started introducing MTB bike categories to encourage cross-overs. Having ridden both on the tracks, the smaller BMX bikes are faster. Things such as suspension are not needed. The tracks are smooth and jumps are landed on the transitions (hopefully!). Suspension just ends up just adding weight, and can interfere with techniques such as pumping the bike.
