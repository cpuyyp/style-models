TL;DR No, moral acts are definitely not beautiful for Kant. They are objects of respect (as consistent through all works on practical philosophy by Kant), which is to some extend similar, but actually more a kind of the sublime. By virtue of judging it as a case of morality, you exclude the mere reflection on the intuition that is kantian beauty simply because of the alteration of the object of reflection. But YES, there has to be "an affinity" between morality and beauty. Actually, Kant states in the quote (which I edited into the question, admittedly) that the positivity (and feeling of universalisability) of the feeling of beauty actually is grounded in it being the symbol of morality. In order to fully answer the question, there have to be three aspects adressed, while the points 2 and 3 some kind of lay ground for the statements of the first one, as section 59 is rather late in the book and many aspects are just reformulations and clarifications of former arguments and conclusions: 

In the english translation, the first "ugly" is missing. And the main verb in the last sentence is missing in both languages. This is a poetical wording. I will fill in the missing words for fuller understanding: 

Yes, there are. Contemporary views J.D. Velleman argues in his works that the (analytic) metaphysics of time, especially endurantism and presentism, are severely inconsistent. He explicitely introduces the Buddhist thought of no-self as an interesting concept that shows us how time could and should be understood, illustrating his own (again, analytic) theory of time. He even talks about not only self and time, but suffering as well, as examples of mere illusions. He further points out that while the works of Derek Parfit mentioned by @Drux point in the correct direction (and indeed contain thoughts similar to Buddhist philosophy), he himself did not make this link and therefore missed some interesting features of his model of self regarding the theory of time as a whole. These thoughts are summarised in the lecture 'So it goes' (2006), freely available as part of the Amherst Lectures (which are always worth a look by the way). Quoting the abstract: 

Hegel himself can be read as materialistic (in a very, very weak sense): In the sense that the general in which the particular being is thought, the concept ("Begriff"), is always "grounded" in the very being of this particular, as it is the generality of the being. BUT he descriminates between being ("Dasein") and reality ("Wirklichkeit"), where reality is what conforms to the concept and therefore is persistant. For him, the main task of our substance (that is "being practical", including "thinking" for developing a grasp on the concepts) is bringing a being into existance that can be seen as a particular of the concepts and therefore is reality (hegelian "idea"). This is why Engels made his claim about Hegel and Marx: Hegel's reality as persistant being is grounded in the concepts of mind/spirit/reason (in the end: GOD). Materialistic would be if the concepts of mind would be grounded in reality. But actually this holds for the later works (Encyclopedia, Philosophy of law) as I do not know his earlier ones ;) 

What does Kant actually write in the mentioned section? How are the sublime and the beautiful destinguished? How is respect (for the moral law) destinguished from both of them? 

Here, Kant speaks of 'concepts of nature' and 'concepts of freedom', which 'attribute to the object' of nature/freedom, i.e. are constitutional for these objects. Subjective principles in contrast express how 'we proceed' in order to reach a given (and may it even be necessary, as eudaimonia and 'thoroughly interconnected experience') aim. They are therefore merely regulative. Another possible (but possibly confusing) way to put it would be the following: 

A possible interpretation is given in Kaufman, W. (1955). Nietzsche and Rilke. The Kenyon Review, 17(1), 1-22. His thesis is that this textbit is about the constant change and reinvention, the creativity and not being bound to making sense, i.e. purposeless striving that allows for doing something really original which then should be repeated eternally (transforming it to a will striving to dominate in order to achieve reoccurrence). Hence, the spirit of a child: 

General remarks The edition suiting your needs depends on many factors. Do you just need a one for all solution that is a good compromise between academic usability and remarks? Do you need a good basis for in-depth academic work? Or do you need a discussion of contemporary literature and a lot of references and explanatory work? I will go into detail for all three of them. Regarding the answer of @MarkH. (one for all type) Seconded on Meiner, at least for the second and third critique. The first critique (at least in my 1998 edition) lacks remarks/end notes, but all for them have a good subject index. Especially the third critique's remarks are excellent, though. For CPR, I recommend reading commentaries alongside. A reasonably complete and comprehensible critical edition would go into the thousands of pages. Weischedel's edition in Suhrkamp is good enough and relatively cheap, but it is outdated and not good for citation imho. An often overseen alternative As for citation, there is an online version of the Akademie-Ausgabe. It even has a full-text search available and is a perfect complement for the one for all editions. But for more extensive work on Kant, it does not suffice in the sense that immediate reading of whole arguments and arcs and writing down the exact reference (including line) is not exactly comfortable when being forced to read from a screen and change the page per click. Regarding in-depth academic work At some point, when dealing with Kant academically, it is worth considering the purchase of Kant's Gesammelte Schriften in the Akademie-Ausgabe. Walter DeGruyter has on-demand printing available. The three critiques are volumes III-V. The special advantage here is that the text of A and B edition (until they are identical) of CPR are printed completely seperately. The main disadvantage is that they are photocopies of the original edition 1900ff., which means they are written in (the old) German type and you may have to become used to reading this first. There are some remarks of the original editioners, but they are not exactly voluminuous. This edition is the very basis of any academic work on Kant rather than something build upon it like you seem to look for. Additionally, Kant's reflections on the topic from different periods can be found in the volumes XVII-XIX. Regarding contemporary literature and explanatory remarks Both cannot be found in the critical editions mentioned above. This is the task of commentaries and introductions. Here, it may in fact be worth looking into English commentaries. They discuss both German and English literature and tend to be more recent. But I think questions on good commentaries on the respective critiques can either be already found (CPR here and CPoJ here) or should be asked seperately. Addendum as per comment The Suhrkamp edition of Georg Mohr consists of all three volumes, they are not sold seperately as it seems. The first two volumes contain the works themselves (in that case, only the first critique and some other texts), the third the commentary. This review says the commentary is quite comprehensive and open to non-academic readers as well. It seems to be worth a look for a first understanding of the text and seminar work, but I'd say that for more academic work (essays, papers, dissertations), it may not be recent and extensive enough. 

Regarding § 59 of the Critique of the Power of Judgement First, please consider the title of this section: On beauty as a symbol of morality. That does make two points to consider: First, we are speaking here of the opposite direction: It is not the moral act that is beautiful, it is the beauty that is a symbol of morality. Secondly, what does this actually mean (for Kant)? Here, Kant is quite clear: 

One thing to always keep in mind: Nietzsche wrote in German. And referring to translations without double-checking (with the original language, if possible!) is always problematic. The original lines read: 

Introduction: Is the thesis correct? There are some authors who surely thought that way. Just to give a few: 

In fact here he says that as soon as we try to go further than a priori principles as found in the three critiques and go for transcendent instead of immanent concepts (see Prolegomena, 4:373, fn.), we transcend all knowledge ("es überschreitet die Grenzlinie alles Wissens [borderline of all knowledge]"). The object of speculations like that would become a no-thing [Unding]. That doesn't mean that we couldn't contemplate on them. But all contemplation then would never be in the realm of knowledge, but mere speculation. That is only consequent, because the difference between object [Gegenstand] and thing [Ding] is the one between the table of judgements (necessary conditions of reference to objects as such [Gegenständen überhaupt]) and the table of categories (necessary conditions of reference to things as such [Dingen überhaupt]) in the Critique of Pure Reason (A70-71 and A79-80 respectively). The latter only makes sense for objects of intuition [Anschauung]; concepts [Begriffe] and intuitions are interdependent and both necessary for constituting things, i.e. objects of knowledge (remember the famous quote about concepts and intuitions in CPR, B75). Therefore the proclaimed contradiction in itself: As soon as intuitions are involved, we can schematize, and only then knowledge is possible. And these intuitions cannot be intellectual, because our understanding simply is not capable of it. I actually think this is the real reason for his needing of a type of the moral law in the second critique, because for the moral law itself, we have no scheme and therefore no (not even practical) knowledge. On the other hand, the moral law itself is arguably the one exception from the rule, as it seems to be some kind of intellectual intuition that cannot be further processed by our understanding and because of that evokes these feelings of reverence. Regarding Fichte, Schelling and Hegel Most contemporary philosophers only learned from CPR through Jacobi's reading of the A edition (which wasn't too accurate) or by the B edition, because there have only been 1000 copies of the A edition and the first edition that featured both was published in 1838. The readings and (mis-)interpretations of all three critiques by Jacobi, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel are perfectly described in Eckart Förster's The 25 Years of Philosophy. For a detailed answer on their objections and their ways to finally get access to things-in-themselves I would recommend reading the book as a whole. One thing you can see from this answer already is that they obviously have to step into speculative idealism, which for Kant would by definition be transcendent, and try to reconcile this with the possibility of knowledge. This is imho exactly what Fichte tries in his Wissenschaftslehre, Schelling with his philosophy of identity in My System of Philosophy, and Hegel in his Science of Logic and even in his earlier Phenomenology of Spirit. Regarding what "Thing-in-itself" [Ding an sich] actually means for a native speaker For native speakers, it is quite obvious that "Ding an sich" means "The thing as it is in its full essence/being". "An sich", as an idiom, means "how it is for real". Substitute would be "eigentlich", translation "actual, rather, intrinsic, real". Regarding the reality of things in themselves Kant has a clear account of what is real and what's not:
