The result is that the Moon has a nearly perfect circular orbit around the Sun, the effect of the Earth is only a perturbation in it: 

There is no such limit, at least not a meaningful one. If the gravity would be more strong, smaller hydrogene clouds could evolve to stars, even Jupiter or Earth sized, or much smaller. As you increase the strength of the gravity, the required mass for star formation decreases, but stars will still exist. 

Extending @Aaron: Which also does matter, that it is relatively common in the universe ( $URL$ ). For example, rubidium has a much lower ionization energy, but it can only be found in traces, while sodium is one of the most frequent elements in the stony planets. 

The current best theory to describe the gravitation is the General Relativity. In it, gravity is not a force, but the change of the curvature of the spacetime as the result of the matter (energy) density in it. Essentially, it has 2 equation systems: 

This can result anything, even a repelling gravitational force. For example, parallel laser beams going into opposite direction repel eachother. The problem is that we would need 40-60 orders higher energy densities to have a measurable effect, so it remains only a theoretical calculation. In the "common" situations, i.e. if we have planets, 

It has a very, very low chance. However, if the asteroid is larger as some centimeters, it will irrecoverable destruct the satellite. Typically, mm sized space trash can damage a satellite already, although the tipical impact velocities are in the order of some $\frac{km}{s}$. As a comparision, cannon balls are flying typically with lesser speed as $1 \frac{km}{s} {}^*$. A collision with an asteroid on a solar orbit would have the impact speed in the order of some tens of $\frac{km}{s}^{**}$. A direct collision with an asteroid larger as the satellite itself would have enough energy to vaporize the satellite. We, from the Earth, would see a space explosion. *: Orbital velocity on low earth orbit is $7.8 \frac{km}{s}$, but most satellites are flying prograde with a not very high inclination. Thus, the we can estimate their "typical" relative collision velocity in the order of some $\frac{km}{s}$. **: The configuration is similar in heliocentris orbits, but the velocities are higher with an order. 

But this surely also implies that we can see beyond the CMB if we see anything which has a red shift indicating an expansion speed very close to $c$. This suggests axiom 2 is incorrect - so what should it be instead? 

The Big Bang happened everywhere and the recombination of electrons with nuclei - the thing that causes the CMB - also happened everywhere. So in every direction you look you can see the radiation from that recombination. But that recombination also happened a long time ago and so, given light has a constant velocity, the places where we can see the recombination take place are also a long way away. And, as a result of the expansion of space-time, that radiation is very red-shifted, so instead of the recombination looking like it is happening at roughly 4000 degrees Kelvin, it looks like something happening at 3 degrees Kelvin. That expansion is also what makes it look like the distant galaxies are all moving away from us and the further away the faster they seem to be moving. 

There are certainly applications of number theory (as opposed to group theory/algebra - but you do also mention abstract mathematics in general) to astrophysics, though many would suggest these applications are on the boundary between real science and metaphysics. One such application is the measure problem - if we assume our universe is one of an infinite number of multiverses how can we draw conclusions about the fundamental physics of the many multiverses, for instance to say that intelligent life is possible in a given proportion. 

There are relatively big varieties, but most of them is between 10 and 70 km/s. If a comet is a periodic comet, that means it needs to have an elliptic orbit around the Sun. That gives an upper limit to its speed of the escape speed from the solar system on the orbit of the Earth. That is around 40 km/s. But this 40 km/s is in the reference frame of the Sun. The Earth is moving in this reference frame with around 30 km/s, on a nearly circular orbit. Between the escape speed and the mean speed of a circular orbit there is always a $\sqrt{2}$ relation. It is a physical law. Theoretically it were possible to find extrasolar comets (if the speed of it were bigger as around 70 km/s, it were a clear signature of its remote origin), but they aren't coming. 

In fact, the "waves" are much smaller (400.000km Moon orbital radius to 150.000.000km Earth orbital radius) This is mainly because $R_{Earth-Moon} \ll R_{Earth-Sun}$, and $M_{Moon} \ll M_{Earth} \ll M_{Sun}$. In general, 3-body gravitationally bound systems tend to be unstable, i.e. one of the components tends to fly away with time. But this system seems stable, because the ratio of the masses are big. The same can't be said from the whole Solar System, (it is a notoriously unsolved problem) although also this seems stable in human time scales. 

There is no way to know, if any other "different Universe" exists. There is also a terminologic problem with it. Universe means, on latinic, something what "contains everything". 

Indeed it was the perturbations of Uranus's orbit that led to the discovery of Neptune - which was itself a major triumph of the scientific process and the mathematician Le Verrier is often credited with the discovery even though he did not actually make the observational discovery. 

There are lots of reasons. First of all because we can see that a typical galaxy is a spiral galaxy and we seem to live somewhere pretty typical. Secondly because we can see the arms of the spiral through close examination of the Milky Way (ie the band in the sky) - through stellar distances and measurements of hydrogen cloud red shifts and so on. But you your question is a perfectly good one because, ultimately, we are guessing a bit as we cannot see the galaxy from anywhere other than one vantage point. 

When the Sun is on the meridian and is due South (local noon in Northern Hemisphere) your hour hand will point to (or close to 12) - assuming your local noon and civil noon are similar! (Daylight saving means 1pm fills this role). The Sun crosses the sky in 24 hours, the hour hand travels round the watch in 12 hours. Hence the watch hour hand is twice as fast, so when the hour hand has reached 2pm, the Sun has only gone half as far (ie "to 1pm"), so if you point the hour hand towards the Sun in this case, the meridian is an hour further behind rather than 2 hours. By the time we get to 4pm the Sun will have travelled "two watch hours" away from the meridian and so on. 

Brown dwarves don't have fusion in their core, thus they don't have their own light. They may have a little heat production from other processes (for example, contraction, or radioactive decay in their core). These aren't enough strong to heat even the dwarf significantly. Many brown dwarve were found orbiting a star closely, they may have surface temperature even in the order of some thousands K. But they get their temperature from their stars. For example, the Jupiter's temperature is only 40K more warm as it would be reasoned by the Sun. In the case of red dwarves, the situation is better. The distance depends on the star. You can very easily calculate it: check its absolute luminosity, so you can see its total power output, compared to the Sun. The radiation what a planet receives (per surface area) depends quadratically from its distance. 

(1) is about the same as of the Earth - the planets were created from the same protoplanetary disk. (2) is significantly stronger, about the double of the Earth's. Surprisingly, also (3) is the same as the Earth - the upper cloud layer what we can see (= which is enough high to be not covered by anything above) has about the same temperature as the Earth. On the Venusian surface, there is very hot ($\approx 450 {}^\circ C$), but it is the result of the greenhouse effect and not of (1). The internal radiative heating is small, around $70-100 \frac{mW}{m^2}$ on the Earth and there is no reason to think that it would be on the Venus significantly different. On an average night, the surface temperature loses 5-15 ${}^\circ C$ due to (3). It depends mainly on how cloudy is the sky. This happens only on the surface - some meters below the surface, there is no daily temperature fluctuation any more. The soil is a very good heat insulator, if it is enough thick, which is well visible also on that how small is (1). Thus, if some space macroengineering project could cover the Venus with a large sunshade, then the Venusian temperature would decrease to a new equilibric state between (1), (2) and (3). This could be significantly smaller, as its current temperature, depending mainly on that, how big percent of the Venusian solar radiation is covered. The time scale of the transition to the new equilibric temperature balance would happen in weeks, at most in months. It wouldn't have any effect to the deeper layers of the Venusian soil, thus minig on the Venus would be still problematic, but covering it with an enough large foil, could reach even a mean Earth-like temperature, too. 

Yes - especially as the occultation does not have to occur on the bright side. Planets may also be occulted (see $URL$ Incidentally the symbol is not originally Islamic. It was the flag of Constantinople when conquered by the Ottomans and then adopted by them. The Ottomans later became the Caliphs - the nominal leaders of the world's Sunni Muslims and so the flag was widely adopted across Islam. 

Stars are, to all intents, infinitely far away and hence present themselves as points - thus the small changes in the atmosphere's refractive index caused by different patches of density and temperature of air make them appear to twinkle. Planets, on the other hand, are relatively close by and (with the exception of the Moon and the Sun itself) whilst we cannot resolve any solar system body into a disk with the naked eye, they are still larger than (most) variations in the atmosphere, hence they don't appear to twinkle or the twinkling is much reduced. The evidence suggests you saw a planet, quite likely Jupiter or Saturn. 

The Earth's equator is inclined to the plane of the solar system (called the ecliptic) by 23 degrees. In other words, the Sun's position, as seen from the Earth, varies between 23 degrees North (at the northern hemisphere summer solstice) and 23 degrees South (at northern hemisphere winter solstice), appearing to cross the Earth's equator twice (at the equinoxes). The tropic lines mark the maximum apparent solar move north or south. The Moon's orbit is inclined by about 5 degrees to the ecliptic so moves over a somewhat wider range of the sky as seen from the Earth. The Moon orbits the Earth every 28 days or so, so moves over that range each month. At full Moon the Moon is opposite the Sun in the sky, so if the Sun was close to the tropic, then the Moon would be around the opposite tropic when full, and so on. 

This "laser star" is a hypotethical object in an Asimov short story, which has a special star-like object with very uncommon properties. But this is entirely Asimov's invention. In the reality, no such thing was found until now. Not even any similar. 

This picture show the Earth-Sun Lagrange-points, but the Sun-Venusian Lagrange points are very similar The Sun-Venus L1 is around 2million km away from the Venus, and it is unstable for point-like mass points. However, in the case of a not point-like body (a planetary-sized foil isn't point-like), or by manipulating the radiation pressure of the Sun, could be made statically stable, or could be stabilized dynamically. 

But the problem is a hypothetical one, as no alternate Universe were found until now. We can play with different Universes in some theoretical constructions. For example, the spacetime of a rotating black hole looks like as if it would be some gateway to somewhere, out of our Minkowski-Universe (or to a different point of our current one). Google for Penrose-diagrams and for the topological extensions of the General Relativity, if you would like to play with it more. 

The relative recent WMAP result shows, the Universe seems infinite. However, the "is the Universe infinite" question has a hidden problem: it doesn't matter, how far away can we see, we can't be sure, if anything out of it is finite or not. :-) Thus, it is about a definitely unknowable thing. The WMAP measured essentially the curvature of the Universe and it found a zero curvature (i.e. it seems to be planar). If there is a minimal curvature, below a measurement precision, and we have a cyclic, spherical geometry, then its radius must be at least 300billion light years. 

Radio telescopes cannot "see further" than optical telescopes but electromagnetic radiation in the range detected by radio telescopes may come from a further distance (i.e. from an earlier time) than detectable by optical telescopes and/or radio waves may penetrate things which are obscured at optical wavelengths. The classic example of the first case is the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - actually the oldest detectable radiation in the universe (assuming our cosmology is even half-close to being right). This is the radiation that was emitted when the early expanding universe cooled just enough to allow hydgrogen atoms to form - the captured electrons gave off radiation and the universe's density was no longer great enough to ensure that radiation caused a balancing ionisation. That happened so long ago/so far away that it now looks like something very cold (about 3 degrees above absolute zero) and so is not detectable at visible wavelengths but is at microwave wavelengths. The second case includes things like radiation from dust clouds in our galaxy - the dust blocks visual radiation but not radio waves. But the premiss of your question is wrong in that it is not a question of dish size and certainly not magnification (the correct parallel with an optical telescope is also dish - or rather lens or mirror - size incidentally.) 

It's not possible to see photons from "beyond" the cosmic microwave background (CMB), because (assuming our cosmology is generally correct) the CMB is the result of recombination of electrons with protons in the early universe. Photons from before that era were absorbed in the plasma. Essentially then, the earliest matter we can see (in photonic terms) is this glowing hot hydrogen, but massively red-shifted so it looks like hydrogen at 3K. We see the CMB in every direction.
