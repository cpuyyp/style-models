There is no part inside a coaster brake that can be harmed by grease. You do need to use a high-temperature grease though, friction makes them get quite hot. 

Suggestion: can you try a spin bike at a gym? Could give you the cycling motion without needing to be on a bike at all. They are heavy, solid and stable so you're not going to fall off. 

I fitted hybrid tyres to my ebike and road speed improved, while track speed was unchanged. Sadly its gone now so I can't show a photo. There was a slight knobbly pattern to the shoulders of the tread, but the bare face had a solid line of flat rubber all the way around. So when riding straight and vertical, it was a slick. When the ground was a little irregular, or when cornering the small lugs had a chance to bite. Cornering on the road stayed mostly on the ring of rubber though, so it was not squirmy. Downside, the pressures were 80 PSI , which took ages to get to on a 1.75" tyre. Plus it was a bumpy ride should the road be less than smooth. The weight of my batteries would have contributed too. Edit: Do be aware that ebikes are heavy. So my 17 kg MTB had another 26 kg of batteries on it, plus me and my gear. When carrying my work toolbag of 20 kilos plus me, that's ~165 kilograms. Handling is definitely affected by the mass, so your tyres have to cope with the full load. 

The motion of the light is what does the work, the colour is less important as long as its bright. A valve light will describe a "flattened corkscrew" through the air and is obviously different to any other vehicle on the road - which means you get perceived by driver's conscious brains not just their subconscious or autonomous brains. These things are brilliant because they're not powered, and reflect a lot of light. They're also lightweight and forgettable. $URL$ 

To clarify - here's shimano's current line up, according to shimano, from the link above, which is dated 2016 and titled "Product lineup" 

Here's an example. Notice entering on the left at fairly decent speed, probably high 30 km/h. The path slews out into the river, and then winds its way back to the road. I have seen far worse at this corner but this was all I could find in a brief search. I do this segment frequently. 

In my country, cycle helmets are mandated by law for use on the road. It is illegal to sell a non-certified helmet for the purposes of riding on the road. So any accident where you're not wearing an approved and certified helmet could result in insurance cover being refused, regardless of whether the helmet is a cause or a mitigator. Like having your car stopped and parked on the road, being struck, but because you have an expired Warrant of Fitness, the insurer refuses to cover your damage because the car shouldn't have been on the road. Its petty, but that's how insurance companies roll. Why risk it? 

Two parts to this question - how to ease off an old grip that you may want to reuse (ie cutting it off is too destructive. Followed by how to fit the new one. I use a thin old electrician's flathead screwdriver to gently lever the edge off the grip up, then tilt the bike so that it leans to the side I'm working on, and then squirt a splash of water and dishwash liquid from a spray bottle into the raised edge. Then withdraw the screwdriver and work the grip around. You can feel it loosen and then it just comes off. To fit the new one, you simply push it on and position the angle before the soapy water dries. Once the water evaporates the dishwash is left behind, providing somewhat of a tacky adhesive. So yes this will leave it slidey for an hour or so while the water dries. You can speed this by leaving the bike in the sunlight, black/dark grips should dry quickly. Personally I'm a big fan of the grips with palm support, but you need them tilted to the right angle before the soap dries. Then tighten the tiny restraining bolts that many new grips have now. 

Disassemble the whole wheel, loosen all the spoke nipples, remove the bare rim hoop. Order replacement stainless steel spokes and brass nipples. Send the rim hoop to a commercial shotblaster for cleanup, with whatever product they recommend. Could be glass pellets, walnut shells, sand, or similar abrasive powders. While these steps are happening, service the hub with new bearings etc. Once the whole rim is bare metal, get it commercially rechromed. A proper chrome expert will know the appropriate grades to use so the brake track works. Reassemble with new spokes and nipples (you may as well do it right) on the fresh hub. 

This one doesn't have a name, but its the cheaper tube-in-tube sort. It does take the edge off, but doesn't give you any setback. 

Generally no - smell would be an indication of heat and vaporisation of something. In a brake it would be the pad turning to smoke with overheating. If your pad is that hot then your rims are about as hot, and will be very noticeable to the touch. This level of heating normally requires hundreds of metres of fast descent, combined with hard braking. Snow on the brakes would pretty much make overheating impossible. I suspect the snow has an odour. Its also possible your location salts the roads in times of snow, and this may be close enough to trigger your nose-memory. 

So? If the pedal spindle has any play, the movement will slowly grind away the first thread because of the increased pressure and that it comes and goes with every revolution. In theory its doing the same on the other side too, but we never notice that damage. As the pedal spindle "self-tightens" it also presses the end of the pedal thread into the crank with applies a side force to the threads of the crank, also deforming and "squashing" the threads away.
