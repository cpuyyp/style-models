The authors of the book mentioned that problem $84$ is an old classical open problem. So I suspect that there should be some papers available on solving the problem partially or fully. 

Let $Q$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space and $E$ be a Banach space. Let $C(Q)$ be the collection of all real-valued continuous functions on $Q$ while $C_b(Q,E)$ be the collection of all $E$-valued bounded continuous functions on $Q.$ Clearly $Q$ is completely regular. Let $\beta Q$ to be the Stone-Cech compactification, where $\beta Q = \overline{e(Q)}$ and $e:Q\to \prod_{f\in C_b(Q),[0,1])}[0,1]$ is an embedding. 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model. 

This answer is partly an expansion of the comments so far. What you are looking for is a type of decoration on groups that (1) lets you evaluate infinite products, and (2) also creates extra points that are the value of some or all of those products. There is one fairly inevitable answer to (1): You should consider topological groups or at least topological spaces, since taking limits in a topology is the main way to extend finite products to infinite products. But for (2), a topology isn't good enough. You get more information from a metric than from a topology, because a metric space has a completion. On the other hand, a metric isn't entirely satisfactory either, among other reasons because it has extra, non-canonical data. A good alternative to a metric is a uniformity. A uniform space also has a completion (in which all Cauchy nets converge) and every metric space is canonically a uniform space. In fact, every well-behaved topological group has a canonical associated uniformity, because you can use the neighborhoods of the identity to make uniform neighborhoods. (I am a little hazy on how exactly the topological group should be well-behaved. It should be sufficient for it to be Hausdorff and for the left and right uniformities to agree.) Thus every such topological group has a completion which is also a topological group, and which then has infinite products which are group elements. As Mark Sapir suggests, one such uniformity is the profinite uniformity on a residually finite group. At the other end, I think that a word-hyperbolic group $G$ has a uniformity defined by Gromov whose completion points are called the Gromov boundary. However, multiplication is not uniformly continuous in this construction; rather you only have that the uniformity is left-invariant. Thus, the completion is not a topological group, but it does have a left action of $G$. You can only define right-infinite products, and you can only multiply them by group elements on the left. Still, you can do that much, which still lets you consider many interesting infinite relations. Your example of groups of matrices is modeled by a uniformity of intermediate quality. The uniformity of the additive Lie group structure on $M_3(\mathbb{C})$ is not the same as the uniformity of the multiplicative Lie group structure on $GL_3(\mathbb{C})$, even though the topologies are the same. Multiplication extends to the completion, but inversion does not. (Toy model: The function $1/x$ on $\mathbb{R}^\times$ is not uniformly continuous in the standard metric on $\mathbb{R}$ and obviously does not extend to $0$.) The completion of $GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ is obviously $M_3(\mathbb{C})$, and any subgroup has an inherited uniformity and a completion which is then a semigroup. So an answer to your second question is that a discrete group can have many different semigroup-completed uniformities, some of which come from matrix representations. 

The Schoenflies theorem, as a variant of the well-known Jordan curve theorem, states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a simple closed curve (aka Jordan curve) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (through Jordan curve theorem) are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk respectively. Equivalently, any Jordan curve $\phi : S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, can be extended to a homeomorphism $\psi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ of the plane. A closer look at the proof of this theorem suggests that it might be a little bit choicy. This is indeed the case, according to the following result of Sakamoto and Yokoyama: 

Hi "DC". I think that I have worked out that the Hermite normal form is a "trichotomous quasipolynomial" in the variable $p$. If $f:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a function, then my definition is that $f$ is a trichotomous quasipolynomial if it is a quasipolynomial for $x \gg 0$, possibly a different quasipolynomial for $x \ll 0$, and in between finitely many unrestricted values. I think that if $R$ is a canonically Euclidean ring — Euclidean with canonically chosen quotients and remainders — then there is a Hermite normal form for matrices over $R$. In particular, I think that $R$ does not have to be a Euclidean domain. As a first try, let $A$ be the ring of all functions $f:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$, using pointwise quotients and remainders. Hermite normal form over this ring is a model of computing Hermite normal form for any $\mathbb{Z}$ family of integer matrices. $A$ is sort-of a Euclidean ring, except it isn't Noetherian. Let $B$ be the subring of $A$ consisting of trichotomous quasipolynomials. Then I believe that $B$ is Noetherian and it is a Euclidean ring. If that is correct, then you obtain a Hermite normal form that is also a trichotomous quasipolynomial. 

They showed that the problem has positive answer if $\beta_0 = 1$ (Theorem $5.5$) or $\gamma_0$ is a limit ordinal (Theorem $4.5$). 

Notations: Recall that $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal. Let $X$ be a Polish space (completely metrizable and separable) and $F(X)$ be the collection of all real-valued functions on $X.$ A function $\rho:F(X)\to \omega_1$ is called an ordinal rank. In other words, ordinal rank assigns an ordinal to a function, typically measuring complexity of the function. 

Here are some definitions and results from the above papers. You may find further information in the mentioned references: Definition. A polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ over the reals $\mathbb{R}$ is $(k, n)$-ary if each $x_i$ is an $n$-tuple of variables. We say that a $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored with countably many colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. The polynomial is unavoidable if it is not avoidable. Similarly, for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is $\kappa$-avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored using $\kappa$ colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. A polynomial is $\kappa$-unavoidable if it is not $\kappa$-avoidable. In fact, $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the chromatic number $\chi (H)$ of its zero hypergraph $H$ is countable, and it is $\kappa$-avoidable if $\chi (H)\leq\kappa$. Example 1. For each $k<\omega$ and ordinal $\alpha$, the polynomial, $x_0+\cdots+x_{k}-x_{k+1}-kx_{k+2}$, in Fox' theorem is a $(k + 3, 1)$-ary polynomial which is $\aleph_{\alpha}$-avoidable if and only if $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{\alpha+k}$. Example 2. The $(3, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x, y, z)=||x-y||^2-||y-z||^2$, for $2\leq n<\omega$ where $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is avoidable. Theorem 1. For each $n < w$ there is a countable partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which avoids every avoidable $(-, n)$-ary polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$. Theorem 2. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, every avoidable polynomial is $m$-avoidable. Theorem 3. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, every $m$-avoidable polynomial is avoidable. Corollary. The followings hold: (a) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $m$-avoidable. (b) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $\omega$-avoidable. 

The theorem provides a linear isometry from $C_b(X)$ onto $C(\beta Q)$ by the mapping $F\mapsto F\circ e.$ However, I do not know whether there exists a Stone-Cech compactification for 'Banach space-valued' mapping, that is, 

After stating the problem, authors mentioned that the problem holds true for finite-dimensional spaces but not for non separable spaces. Then they point to the reference,page $255$ which contains the problem above. 

The generalization covers the case $\xi=1$ as every continuous function is of Baire Class $0.$ When $\xi = 2,$ it is well-known that $\chi_\mathbb{Q}$ is of Baire Class $2$ as it is a pointwise limit of $(g_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ where $g_n(x) = \max\{0,1-n d(x,K)\}$ and $K$ is a finite collection of rationals. (extracted from Wiki) Since $\chi_\mathbb{Q}$ is discontinuous everywhere, so it is not of Baire Class $1.$ This MSE post also contains other Baire Class $2$ functions. However, I fail to obtain any Baire Class $3$ function and above. 

The present post is intended to tackle the possible interactions of two bizarre realms of extremely large and extremely small creatures, namely large cardinals and quantum physics. Maybe after all those paradoxes and uncertainty phenomena among weird tiny particles, which follow their own weird quantum logic, and after all those controversies surrounding the right interpretation of what is going on in the sub-atomic universe, the last straw that would break the camel's back could be the discovery of a series of statements in quantum theory which are independent or have large cardinal strength set theoretically. The fact that will send such physical statements beyond the realm in which the so-called usual mathematical tools can afford us a solution. Not to mention that inspired by Hilbert's sixth problem and Godel's incompleteness theorems, some prominent physicists already brought up discussions concerning the possibility of obtaining independence results or existence of undecidable facts/theories in physics. In this direction see Stephen Hawking's lecture, Godel and the end of universe. [The corresponding post on MSE might be of some interest as well]. Anyway the bad (good?) news is that the intersection of large cardinal theory and quantum physics is non-empty (if not potentially large). For example one may consider the following theorem of Farah and Magidor in the Independence of the existence of Pitowsky spin models which contains an assumption of consistency strength of measurable cardinals. [cf. R. Solovay, Real-valued measurable cardinals, Axiomatic Set Theory, 1971.] 

To me, the question sounds like, "How do I get over the bred desire to meet everyone in sight, and instead work on the desire to fall in love with a specific person?" So my personal answer is: It is just so THRILLING to solve an interesting open problem. Learning material is very nice, I like it a lot. But when I have gotten new results, those have been the among the happiest and most memorable moments of my life. (And I don't think that that is an unusual sentiment.) I don't just mean "big" results; even "small" results feel wonderful. Maybe the bred desire that you mention is (or is related to) the emphasis on "theory building". Yes, theory building is great, but I personally see it through the lens of problem solving. The best solution of all to a problem is one that is short and sweet, and doesn't use an excessive amount of theory. Of course, unless you're Erdos (who would not have asked the question), you wouldn't solve open problems all the time. If you're a graduate student, the experience may seem inaccessible. So I might suggest answering a few questions on MathOverflow, in a certain frame of mind. Take some relatively rigorous MO questions (related to your thesis topic, say) and work on them as if they're open. Or, another good method is to collaborate with someone who has that problem-solving itch. Or watch such people work; see what animates them. 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues.
