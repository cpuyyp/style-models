Paints which have dried will still emit VOC's continuously, as do carpets, wallpaper glues, and treated flooring (and subflooring). If the objects are exposed to sunlight, they will emit higher levels of chemicals. (For further reading you could look up specific emission rates for the desired object) The biggest way to combat poor indoor air is to ventilate. You'll never be able to rid your house of VOC's, but you can lessen their impact by ensuring you refresh the air often. 

Back to the camel/rabbit issue; both are carriers of diseases which can affect man. Since the aforementioned diseases would also affect various organs of the animals, they would not be considered edible under Jewish dietary law. Shellfish, clams etc - you can't see the organs of them to know whether or not they're clean - therefore they aren't edible. My opinion: As far as not eating something that keeled over dead one day... that should be a no-brainer, as is the case with carrion - rabies Since sanitation and food preparation left MUCH to be desired, foods which were 'risky' were banned, as were any animals known to commonly carry diseases which could affect men. 

Depending on the outdoor pollution level (PM, smog, NOX, SOX, VOCs) along with the number of indoor source pollutants, it is very likely that the indoor pollution is higher than the outdoor. (This is very much the case in developing countries.) Again - the ventilation of the home is the major mediator of pollution levels. 

As a comparative note to the Ha, et al, 2009 study given above, it is interesting to note that the Faroese children had at birth a geometric mean Hg cord blood concentration of 22.9 μg/l, and at aged 7 years 8.82 μg/l, notably higher than the Korean children studied. 

Whether or not you can 'wash' off a pesticide/fungicide/preservative is a function of its water solubility. In the cases of something which is water soluble, yes, a simple wash will suffice. Carbofuran is water soluble, and its half-life in mature fruit was estimated at 4 days. Methidathion is also water soluble: 

I don't believe there's a magnet in existence today which could 'pull' a cloud of gunpowder the distance of a football field. The reason: gunpowder contains no metals, and it is not paramagnetic. Gunpowder's main ingredients are nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin (single or double based) When Indy got closer to the crate, he used the buckshot from a rifle if I recall correctly - in that case I would guesstimate the same magnetic force as an MRI machine could do it with ease. 

As an environmental chemist, I can honestly tell you that most people don't realize just how bad their indoor air quality is, since they don't realize just how many items in their home are contributing to it. With regards to measuring indoor air quality, the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards can be found here, and the EPA has a publication database on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) available here. There are a number of devices used to sample the indoor air periodically which calculate the total amount of chemical/PM present over a given amount of time. The type of pollution you'll encounter is indeed influenced by where you live, with regards to mold, NOX, SOX and such (the EPA has a lovely "Where you live" resource link available here) Regional differences aside, there are a few 'standard' pollutants found in pretty much all homes: particulate matter (PM), passive smoke, formaldehyde and other VOC's, air fresheners/cleaners (seriously). It's also worth mentioning heating sources: fireplaces, wood burning stoves, gas stoves, furnaces and the like; if they're not functioning and/or used properly then they can emit pollutants indoors - notably NO2 and SO2. Home ventilation plays a key role in indoor air quality: if your home isn't well ventilated, then the pollutants are able to accumulate in the ambient air to levels which can trigger a response in the people living there - asthma, headaches, etc. Also, the quality of the materials used in the home can contribute to the quality of the indoor air, as well as its age. Bernstein, et al (2008) published "The health effects of nonindustrial indoor air pollution" in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (121:3) - it's a pay site, but I have access to it, and I'll give a brief overview of their findings below. Ozone: Links like the one you've provided talk about the 'health benefits' of ozone. They neglect to mention the health risks: 

Glycolysis is the method by which glucose, fructose and galactose into pyruvate, acetic acid and a Hydrogen ion. The energy released via this process is used to form ATP and NADH, which the body uses to perform work. NADH+ must be oxidized to NAD+ or the whole glycolysis reaction stops (all the NAD+ in the cell is used up) One method to oxidize NADH+ is fermentation - the production of ethanol. Ethanol is only produced in animals in muscles which are overworked and starved of oxygen (ie: anaerobic) - and this process CANNOT be sustained. Oxygen MUST be returned to the cell. Otherwise, in aerobic organisms the NAD+ is produced (essentially) via the Krebs cycle. Bacteria also utilize fermentation. But in order for the human body to be producing ethanol in amounts large enough to damage itself, it must be starved of oxygen for prolonged periods; which is lethal regardless of potential ethanol production.

In order for conception to occur, there has to be an egg (or ova) present for the sperm to fertilize, where the 'average' woman will ovulate around day 14 (from the first day of the last menstrual period). Of course, not every woman is average. Because the human ova is viable for a short period (~24 hours), knowing the right 'window' of time is helpful if you wish to become pregnant. The calendar method can (and often is) used in conjunction with basal body temperature measurements and the examination of mucus, and is based upon statistical analysis studies. Some calendars will show a fertility window for the next 3 months, allowing for more 'planning' of bedroom fun. (Vacation, honeymoon, etc) I'll be honest, it's much easier for me to plunk down my information on a calendar, hit "ENTER" and get a nifty calendar in front of me for the next 3 months, than to pull out my desk calendar, find the first day of my last menstrual period, then count forward to when my next should arrive, then backwards again 14 days, then back another 4 days, etc....and to do that for the next three months? Call me lazy, I don't mind. Common sense (and logic) says that if you want to get pregnant, you need to have sex. However, work, school, kids, and life in general can sometimes distract you - and having a calendar can give that extra 'nudge' in the right direction. (wink wink, say no more). Is using the calendar the best option? No, charting BBT and purchasing an ovulation test are much more precise; however they aren't free - while an online calendar is. There are also women who aren't thrilled about taking and charting their temperature daily. There are also women who utilize it for avoiding pregnancy - given the short lifespan of the ova, they know which days to avoid unprotected sex - this was called the rhythm method Current natural family planning methods utilize a similar approach, which avoids intercourse during the most fertile phase.

The above table lists what chemicals are emitted by indoor items, I've taken the time to give a small summary of where you'll find them in your home. Please note that my list is by no means exhaustive of the sources. Adhesives: furniture, wood floorings, moldings - anything that's been glued in your house. Particleboard also is smothered in adhesive. Carpeting: it's treated to resist stains and smells - it's often glued and nailed down. Cleaners: If you're using a cleaner that should be diluted - and don't dilute it properly - then you'll be left with a residue that contributes to the PM pollution in your home. Linoleum - again, glued down. Millwork: all that lovely molding, window casings, baseboards and doors - yep. It's contributing. Office furniture: again, particle board, glues and all. Most homes have at least 1 computer and a computer desk/hutch. Paints: If your walls aren't painted, then they're most likely wallpapered. Either way - they both emit VOC's. Others: any spray (air fresheners, deodorants), tobacco smoke, CO & benzene from your attached garage, etc. Textiles: ALL textiles are treated for shipping - do you wash your drapes before you hang them? What about the pillows on your sofa and the cushions? Now to answer your question, "is indoor air pollution really higher than outdoor air pollution?" The answer is: it depends. The air inside your house comes from the outdoor environment (and the amount present in the outdoor air will vary daily) - therefore any pollutants that were present in the outdoor air are now present in your home. Koponen, et al (2000) studied the effect of outdoor air pollution on indoor air and determined: 

There are a number of environmental factors which can influence cancer in man. Bracken ferns (eaten in the US, Canada and Japaan as Fiddlehead ferns) contains the compound ptaquiloside (PTQ). PTQ is a known carcinogen - and it's responsible for some forms of cancer (gastric) in both animals and humans. Obviously those at greatest risk are those living in areas with a large Bracken fern population, as it does leach to the groundwater and does pass into the milk of cows (which could be a potential exposure route to other populations). It's also been suggested that PTQ can, in conjunction with other viruses (HPV) be a contributing factor to squamous cell carcinomas in cattle and possibly in humans. So no, cancer is not a 'man made' disease - there are a number of natural sources of cancer in the environment.
