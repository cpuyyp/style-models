Kamma is largly based on intention...in both the cases you have given the intention is not clear. Moreover Kamma is not some measurable quantity that can be quantified...so you cannot ask such questions like whose Kamma is more bad... 

I understand that if I am looking at a beautiful woman, I am obviously not seeing as she is, but what when I am looking at a clear blue sky, not clouded by ignorance, lust, and greed, am I seeing things as they are? Or I should necessarily have to have insight into Three marks of existencece? Can I see things as they are without Enlightenment? If so, can only an enlightened being see things as they are? Sometimes when we look at a flower we can see something transcendental, something which is greater than the sum of the parts. (Not a concept from Buddhism) but some people have an aura around them, even the Buddha in pictures is shown with an aura around His head. So does seeing this metaphysical reality constitute seeing thins as they are? 

I am glad that people here were considerate while stating their opinions about Osho. Osho cannot be considered Buddhist in traditional sense as He did and said many things that Buddha didnt recommend from an Enlightened being like lavish life style, music, singing, dancing etc But from an another vantage pount he really really was buddhist rather than anyone else... He stressed on becoming a Buddha yourself rather than following anything at all...which really the Buddha would have stressed that get enlightened yourselves... Osho stressed highly on meditation...which is really the Buddhist way to become arahant along with other things... Osho's comnentry on heart sutra, diamond sutra, dhammapada...is unparalled...He is only contemporary teacher who have spoken on Thervada, Mahayana, Zen, Vajrayana, Buddhist Tantra... He made his Sannasins wear a maroon robes like the tibetean buddhists...ok not yellow...but similar to tibeteans... Osho synthesized many things... He talked of rebirth, impermenance, no self, and dukkha...amongst othet things... So I really see their no reason why He cant be called a Buddhist....but he himself hated being pegion holed...so rather not call him a buddhist... But more and more I understand Buddhism...I understand that self is an illusion...so even calling my self a buddhist is somewhere wrong... 

I think this will take you too far with the body contempletion meditation. And if nothing works contemplate on this story of buddha. 

As I have understood, Heavenly and Hellish realms are determined by state of mind. It is well said that two people can be walki g down the same street and one is in hell and other is in heaven. Heaven and hell is the way we experience this universe. So if you do meditation and you get born in a monastry world setting and it is still heavenly as it will all be experienced. 

Because Samsara is Nirvana (this is something I learned in Zen). Also not focusing on people who are not of profit to you or not yours shows selfishness and will bolster your ego. Remember the Jataka tales and remember all the sacrifice the Buddha did in His previous life for other beings, out of compassion. 

Vipassana needs higher levels of concentration and mindfulness. Instructions for Vipassana are little bit more complicated and difficult to follow than Samatha. Vipassana involves using the mind to sense the bodily feelings. Mind usually wanders. Learning Vipassana for first time requires a 10 day commitment to a retreat. But Samatha meditation can be learned at a days retreat. 

Pahāna Sutta But is attachment a necessary condition for anger? For greed? Attachment or it's flavours are necessary conditions for greed. Anger is a form of grief hence you can include anger also. 

Unless you are fully liberated you create new Sankara. The old Sankara you eliminated through practice Vipassana is Ahosi (or rendered in effective) NB: This is answered in the context of interpretations of the Ledi Sayadaw lineages as I see the question seams to be from some one looking at it from this perspective. 

Many of the gross realities many intelligent people can deduce. It is the subtle ones they cannot deduce though logic. E.g. If you ask any one "Can I live for ever?", they would respond "No". At the subtle level is what you need to see through meditation. Everything arises and passes away. (Udayawaya nana) You just have to see this to realise impedance. What arises you cannot control hence non self. What ever feeling that arises passesaway hence all feelings are unsatisfactory. 

The other two arrise and exist due to Moha or lack of Panna. Hence this is the the hardest. You break this and the other two will break away. You cannot break any or both of the other two while you have Moha. 

Most in depth explanations happens in the Abhi Dhamma. There are 52 Cetasikas our of which 50 come under Sankara (with the exception of Feeling and Perception). Explaining the 50 would need a small size book and maybe beyond the scope of an answer in this format hence refer to: Mental Factors By Dharmacharya Ruwan Buddhika, The Abhidhamma in Practice by N.K.G. Mendis, Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, Mental factors. According to the Suttas there are 3 types of Sankaran (Cūla Vedalla Sutta, (Paṭicca,samuppada) Vibhanga Sutta): 

So when you see a person of the opposite sex the 1st time, what you get is Kama Raga and Suba Sanna. This is in seeking of pleasure born of such interactions. Though Kama Raga heavily influences Chanda Raga, the main thing is that the person is influential in you life / perceived world. As the "puppet master" of the perceived world you get pleasure from the "puppets" in the show when they seem to go according to your expectations. Chanda Raga is what might keep a relationship going even when Kama Raga subsides with time and into old age when Suba Sanna wanes off. Though in seeking pleasure we get the above 3, in fact these give diverse sensations: pleasure, displeasure, neutral due to impermanent nature and non self nature of existance. All the experience you can derive from it is Dukkha (pain - Dukkha Dukkha, pleasure - Viparinama Dukkha, neutral - Sankhara Dukkha). So to understand the 4 Noble Truths contemplate on the arising and passing of sensations. 

In normal work no need to pick. Just keep a check that your awareness is present on some sensation or the other. In simple terms, your focus should be on the arising and passing of sensations like in the Pahāna Sutta. 

Good karma are intention which drive actions which mature into results which are deemed favorable and bad karma are intention which drive action which mature into results which are deemed unfavorable. Karma is the product of intentional action may it be mental, verbal or physical.
