Here's a very, very simple explanation: "why did it take so long to get here?" There's two aircraft carriers, A and B, fifty miles apart on the ocean. You've got a helicopter that flies 50 mph. Of course, it takes one hour to make it from A to B. Now, imagine A and B are both moving - they're steaming away from each other at a good speed. Of course, it now takes longer than an hour for the chopper to make it between A and B. Regarding the many, many mysteries of the metric expansion of space, this trivial observation is just one thing to bear in mind. Note that of course this is not a full and complete analogy, and the analogy is indeed utterly wrong / totally irrelevant to many aspects of the broader discussion. "I thought that the photons were "trapped" in an expanding ball" sure, the chopper can only move at 50 mph over the water underneath it meaning that at any given time it can only have moved so far over the water underneath it (a sort of "circle of achievablity", if you will). But you can see with the carriers moving the hell all over the place, it's just an open question whether the chopper reaches B in much less than an hour, much more than an hour, or can never reach B at all. 

As best as is known, what is the latest thinking on in the issue of, in which constellation was GW150914, and in which constellation was GW151226? (That is to say, within the large uncertainty, as best as is known in what direction is the likely center of that uncertainty?) 

No need to make it complicated: what about this... Just scribble a rectangle on a piece of paper, and say "there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy".... Then, color off (let's say) 1/3 of the rectangle, and say "only one third of those are the sort of star that could have life, so that's blah billion" Then, color off (say) 9/10ths of that box, and say "we believe about 90% of those have planets - so that's blah billion" Then, color off (say) 1/20th of that box, and say "of those with planets, it seems that about 1 in 20 have Earth-like planets. Now we're down to blah billion..." and so on. (Note: the Drake equation has a number of fairly silly terms relating to "nuclear war!", which were added as political sops in that era; suggest ignore these unless you want to sound 90 years old!) So just scribble a box or draw a line on a piece of paper ... or maybe use "a bag of marbles" as the other answer suggests. Just BTW there is in fact an entire documentary (I noticed it on "Netflix") called "The Drake Equation" which does exactly what you say... 

Andromeda is about 2.5 million ly away. Actually, in this universe, at what "speed" (in km/h) are two objects separating cosmologically - I mean strictly due to the "expansion of the universe" - if they are 2.5 million ly apart? I do understand that local "ordinary" or "peculiar" motion completely swamps this effect. If I'm not mistaken, the "local" "ordinary" motion of Andromeda per our galaxy happens to be about 400,000 km/h towards us. Is the "speed" due to the "expansion of the universe" drastically smaller than this? 

Explanation: $URL$ Note that just as you say, light interference is a huge problem for instruments this insanely sensitive. GAIA has a problem where, apparently some tiny little bits of the sun-shade (like small hairs) were poking around, and that is enough to cause stray light; also some ice particles seem to be causing stray light. $URL$ 

Finally if your question is about either (C) inside our galaxy but not near a star, or, (D) midway between the galaxies: That's too difficult. 

If your question is about (B) in the solar system - say "on Uranus" or the like. There is remarkably less light there than on Earth, the sun is much smaller. Many young people don't realize this; everything's basically dark all the time from about Saturn outwards! Outstanding page explaining this: $URL$ 

It's simply because the sun and planets were formed out of a big pile of dust. Originally the dust was spinning. So once the dust became planets, it kept spinning around. That's all there is to it - that's why the solar system is spinning around. It's was once a pile of dust that was spinning a bit; it's still spinning. You then ask, "For example, if you turned off gravity, why would the planets carry on moving?" THat's just the same as asking "if I spin something around on a string, and break the string, why does it keep moving?" For that matter, it's the same as asking "What is momentum?" So, if you push something ...... why does it keep moving? At this stage in history, we have utterly no clue, at all, what the heck time, space, matter, and momentum are. "Why does momentum do what it does?" is for now just one of those super-deep questions like "What is time" or "So what caused the big bang" or "What is gravity" or "What's the explanation for this quantum stuff?" or indeed ... "What is momentum"? So, why do the planets keep moving?: answer "momentum". If you want to know "what causes momentum?", that is one of the basic total mysteries. For now, nobody has a clue. You may as well ask ... what is space, what is time, etc. Regarding momentum, you might like to read up about the so-called "Mach's conjecture". The famous Einstein was, like you, fascinated by the question "WTF is momentum anyway?" One sort of general thinking-point originating with this smart guy called Mach is that momentum could have something to do with "all the other mass in the universe". Nobody has a clue about this, and it's just a vague general idea. Isaac Newton was a pretty smart guy (if a bit whacky), and in the end he found gravity so mysterious, he just put it down to God. He probably found momentum as mysterious, and he was one of the first guys to think about it clearly. An interesting point: actually everything astronomers look at (all galaxies, all structures of galaxies) in fact does not (!) behave the way small things (our solar system, as in your question) behaves in terms of gravity and momentum. This is usually explained by invisible unknown matter ("dark matter") or for a few scientists, that gravity works differently than we think presently. So the fact is with issues like gravity/momentum you ask about ... not only do we have no clue "why momentum works" but when you look through a telescope, issues like "orbits" work totally differently anyway! 

I assumed that the expansion of the universe (or "of the spacetime metric") is even everywhere: it's well known that it only affects "the largest structures" but I still assumed that the expansion is the same in my room, my galaxy, my cosmological region. Perhaps this assumption is totally wrong? 

The reason? Galaxies are very big. That is to say very thin. They have incredibly low density. Because of this there is simply no dilation at all. (Well, only a minuscule amount - but that is true of simply, say, standing on Earth.) That's the story! 

I'm sorry my answer is off by about 700,000 miles compared to what you asked :) I'm fairly sure there did not happen to be, a time when NASA had cameras on the moon, when, there was a lunar eclipse. Note that cameras today (such as this one on ) are unbelievably better than cameras from era, so this would blow away any merely 700,000 miles closer imagery captured during the Apollo era. 

The mindboggling GAIA spacecraft-telscope sort of does what you suggest! That's kind of the closest concept to what you describe. Just as explained in JamesS answer, if you were that far away you wouldn't be in orbit around the Earth. But, GAIA's L2-like orbit is kind of the closest thing to what you say. 

Say an asteroid identical in all ways to the Chicxulub impactor (size, mass, materiel, orbital type, etc) was about to hit us. (Again!) As of exactly early 2018, given our known instruments and indeed our known watch-out-for-asteroid-collisions systems, in fact, 

One huge confusion with "parsecs" is this: Parallax means the distance an object moves in two photos take six months apart. That technique can be used with objects from 1 to about 100 parsecs away from us. However, astronomers (for convenience) still use the measure "parsecs" even when the distance is far more than 100 parsecs. And, they even use the measure "parsecs" for things like "size", which just have no connection at all to parallax photo measurements. If you hear that something is "5000 parsecs away", it is inconceivable the distance was determined using parallax photo measurements!! And, if you hear that something is "1000 parsecs wide", that just has no connection at all to parallax photo measurements (it's a width - nothing to do with the distance from Earth!!) In the question at hand here, the "width" of an object was quoted in parsecs. The OP was originally assuming that, since parsecs were mentioned in relation to the width, you could use something related to the technique of parallax photo measurement, in relation to the width. In fact, parallax photo measurement just has no connection, whatsoever to width. You literally might as well use smell or taste - heh! The confusion is that parsecs happen to be also used (very confusingly) to measure things like width: but remembering that the technique of parsecs (parallax photo measurement) has absolutely no connection at all to width, and no connection to anything more than 100 ps from us. 

Quite simply, in both cases the effect is absolutely tiny. Here is your basic confusion, on both this and the other similar question: 

We're (basically) in the middle of an arm of our galaxy. That is to say, we're sitting in the middle of a dense disc of stars. It would seem to me that. You should see: the thick line of the milky way all around you, i.e. on that plane, in all four directions. (Additionally - sure - in the particular direction of the galaxy center, you would additionally see the huge central bulge.) However: this does not seem to be the case: when you look at the milky way from the vicinity of our solar system, you basically see it "in one direction". What am I misunderstanding? How come the sky object "the milky way" is well-known as only a lump/strip in one direction, rather than, a lump/strip that goes right around us? -- Put it this way... Quite simply does anyone have any photography of the anti-galactic point? (Near "Auriga" right?) Does it show any "milky way band" going through it? If not why not? Looking outwards, we are still looking through ~30k lightyears of the dense disk we are sitting in. 

I guess a related question would be: "about what is the density of bok globules near us?" ... in a cube of 1000pc on a side, about how many bok globues are we talking? one or two or thosuands?? 

Pretend you're in our galaxy near Earth and you're standing upright wrt the flat galactic disk. If you look directly towards the center of the galaxy, that's Sagittarius. If you swivel your head and look directly away from the center, I believe that's around Auriga. In fact, if you look straight up, about which constellation is that? And if you look straight down? (If I'm not mistaken, could be wrong, this is equivalent to asking about...
