Seems like I'm a Necromancer again... Most likely a spacer. No, I take that back; Almost certainly a spacer. With the Hybrid cassette fitting correctly, it's quite often that they are slightly thicker, even by a couple of millimeters. An easy way to check is to check the limiter screws on the deraileur if you haven't adjusted them. If there's too far away from the wheel for where the jockey wheels line up, it's probably missing a spacer. If not, it needs a thicker spacer or more, assuming the gears were properly set up before you took it to pieces. Also, good call, taking the cassette off to clean it. Too many times, people leave it on their wheel using a degreaser to clean it, and it breaks down the grease inside the hub and freehub body! Annoying because I usually get asked to replace them when it happens, then I lecture them about all the problems from doing so..... Boring! 

As any others have said, nope, nothing will reeeaaallllyyy happen. The only thing you need to worry about is if the water sits for too long on parts such as your chain. Just make sure you buy proper lubricants, and NOT WD40's spray can!!!! ;) Also, if you plan to do that often, it's best to just get a cheap rag and wipe the bike down to dry off most of the water first. Stops the water sitting in places that it probably shouldn't be in! 

I personally do a full bike overhaul every six months, though I absolutely torture my road bike doing off-roading on places I wouldn't even put a mountain bike.... My chain is cleaned thoroughly after every ride, and then stored in a small vat of chain oil to keep it from rusting. (Bad practice, I know, but I'm lazy and like to make sure the chain is ready for every ride. Pull it out, attach it, run it through the cogs a couple of times and then wipe off the excess oil from the chain and cogs and derailleur before the ride.) I'd first remove the wheel, get my cassette lock-ring removal tool and a chain whip and remove the cassette, taking a note of all the positions of the rings. Then, on my cassette, there are little holes that were probably put in for weight reduction; I'd nail each cog onto a big board of ply-board, soak in a strong degreaser and agitate with a brass wire brush, then pressure-washing off everything, then repeat on the other side. (As I said, this bike is tortured, and as such, everything needs a very heavy cleaning...) The free-hub itself I would also replace, too. Every year or so, I replace my chain, chain-rings and cassette, bottom bracket, headset and hub axles/bearings. I personally disagree with using a degreaser on the cassette whilst it's still on the wheel as the degreaser can get into the wheel hub, and much worse, into the free-hub mechanism itself. A more basic way would be to just remove the cassette, degrease it in a plastic tub and leave it to soak for a couple of minutes then brush off with a plastic brush, rinse off and then re-assemble. Place your (I'm assuming) freshly-cleaned chain back on, lubricate the chain and then ride on! If possible, avoid getting oil on the chainrings; only the insides of the chain need lubrication. There is no extreme heat happening on the chain and cassette, so lubrication is not a requirement, and if anything, would hinder the efficiency of your chain by something hilarious like 0.0005 percent because of the layer of oil there. A pathetic number, but another good reason is it'll turn any road dust and brake dust into a grinding paste for your chain. 

The cable pull ratio was changed for the listed models, whereas previous generations were compatible with a wide range of Shimano and non-Shimano brake components. Use Shimano's Specifications site to compare the compatibility of your levers and brake calipers. $URL$

In England and Wales, under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 goods must be as described, of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose. Regardless of warranty length, a product which is intended to last many years but fails after a few months of use can be deemed faulty or unfit for purpose. Within the first 6 months, it is assumed that the product did not meet the contract specification when delivered. After 6 months a fault may indicate the product fell short of the durability expectations. The contract of sale is with the retailer, not the manufacturer, so don't let the retailer pass the buck. Your local laws may have similar principles. 

That sounds like 3/8 inch. Take the hub to a bike shop, they'll be able to pick out a compatible axle for you. 

There would be a measurable decrease in drag from removing external d√©railleurs and gearing, however I would guess that the power loss through an internally geared hub would make such a setup slower rather than faster. (I have no sources for this) 

That chainring doesn't look particularly worn from this angle. The wear would make the teeth look less symmetrical and more like shark fins. That shorter tooth allows the chain to leave that ring more easily when you change gear. Ensure the chain is not worn out using a gauge (see $URL$ for what types of gauge are available and how to use them). If you grab the chain at the front of the chainring and pull it away from the crank spindle, you shouldn't be able to get more than about 1mm of gap between the chain and the dips between the teeth. 

Having seen the video, it looks like your derailleur is MASSIVELY outside of it's B-tension adjustment. Put it on the biggest cog and turn the B-adjustment screw to the point where the top cog of the derailleur is about 3-4mm away from the cog. In my personal experience, this is a common cause besides the actual indexing, and it looks quite likely here, too. Also, that chain looks a bit big for an eleven-speed set-up; Is it original? Also check for chain wear, as this will cause a horrifyingly loud sound, along with wearing out the cogs faster. Also, and this might sound a bit basic, but please bear in mind we have all skill-levels here; Is the wheel properly aligned within the rear drop-outs? The wheel on the derailleur side needs butting up against the very furthest point of the drop-out, or rather, shoving in as far as it'll go. The drive-side is used to make sure the wheel is A) grabbing onto a safe amount of material and B) to essentially 'zero' the alignment for the cogs, and where they sit inside the frame. Remember, the adjustment screws on the derailleur only adjust where the derailleur will sit within the frame, not where it'll hit the cogs. You can use the old-style method of measuring the gap between the frame and where the first cog would be, and then measure the distance of the first and last cogs, then adjust the tension of the cable to make it evenly move around the range, and have a perfect derailleur adjustment, you don't actually need the wheel within the frame to do an indexing. However, it is recommended for less experienced to just do it with the wheel on, and it also helps with fine-tuning. After checking the wheel's alignment, make absolutely certain that the springs on the derailleur are moving easily, with no noise, and without requiring cable tension to be dropped to near zero. They should only need a slight tension adjustment to make a fairly drastic gearing change. Good luck with the repair! 

BB92 is also known as PF41. The shell width should be 91.5mm and the inner diameter should be 41mm. 30mm: According to SRAM's 1x11 frame fit specifications, the inner part of the XX1 "spider" sits 45.5mm from the centreline (Dimension W1). The equivalent dimension is 43.5mm for X1 cranksets. MTB BBs compatible with Hollowtech 2 should have a fully-assembled width of 96.5mm. Road HT2 BBs should have a fully-assembled width of 91mm. It won't be possible to fit SRAM 30mm cranks to a BB92-spec frame without permanently modifying the frame. There are various systems which use a 30mm diameter axle and greater lengths, including Rotor, Hope, and eThirteen. GXP: Many brands produce BB92/PF41 bottom brackets for GXP cranksets, but this combination is not common so many retailers won't have them in stock. Hope offer converters to allow GXP axles to be used with their 24mm bottom brackets. These should not be used with Shimano BBs as they already have a plastic "top-hat" spacer between the bearings' inner casings and the axle, whereas Hope use bearings with a 24mm. 

Tyres. Easy upgrade, quite cheap. Chainset. The Praxis Turn M30 crank is about the same weight as Shimano Ultegra, but is surprisingly stiff. Praxis make a matching bottom bracket for most shells, including "old-school" BSA threaded 68mm shells. Stem. Thomson Elite X4 is heavier than their X2 "road" model, but you'll struggle to twist the stem and the 4-bolt clamp is nice and wide. Carbon bars, but not a superlight model, since you need them to be stiff for acceleration. 

But only until heat causes the water to become gas, which is compressible. When this happens, the lever feels a lot less stiff and pressure at the pad is drastically reduced. 

According to the Shimano document SI-6R3FA-002, FD-M191 works with the Acera M360 groupset, which is 8 speed, whereas FD-M590 is a 9 speed component. 

Many tyres can be made to work without a tube, but tubeless tyres tend to work fine with tubes. The bead of a tubeless tyre is smooth and moulded more accurately than non-tubeless tyres, to form a tighter seal with tubeless-compatible rims. You may be able to achieve tubeless running with a non-tubeless tyre, but it's likely you will need to use more sealant compound. Some tubeless systems use a standalone valve, others use a valve integrated into the rim strip. For "ghetto tubeless", you can take an innertube from a smaller size and cut it to resemble the tubeless rim strips that have valves. (I've never done this, YMMV). If you don't mind getting messy with sealant, try it. If you fail, fit a tube! 

I'll answer all your questions in order. 1) "Will this tire wobble wear down the bearings faster, or other components?" -Nope, this wobble will do pretty much nothing to the rim. If anything, you will feel the slightest of 'floating' (the only way I can describe it, the bulge ever-so-slightly lifting the bike when you go over it.) 2) "is this amount considered normal, and won't do any harm?" -Any tyre wobble is not classed as normal, though it will not do any harm to you, the bicycle or your bike's performance. 3) "Is this as true as you can get on such a cheap bicycle?" - The bicycle has nothing to do with the tyre. If the bike was ¬£120, you can still get ¬£80 Continentals. The tyre's quality, however, is quite a big factor. If you bought them for ¬£12 a piece, there's a high chance that there may be minor defects. 4) "Should I spend more time trying to adjust or leave it as it is?" -Leave it. If anything, you risk doing more damage to the tyre/rim, constantly playing with it. Ride around on this tyre for a couple days. In my experience with cheaper tyres, they'll settle down. It's usually due to storage/transit. Re-inflating usually gets rid of any deformation, though not always. Riding it for a while will eventually get it to even out. If the tyre is damaged, you'll usually notice a very major bulge. If you take an innertube and inflate it, looking at the valve, you'll notice it has a weird shape around where the valve is. It'll look somewhat like that, but on the tyre. 

So, I broke a Shimano Sora rear derailleur last night... Ouch, there goes a load of cash... What had happened was the hanger was bent slightly inwards, yet was functioning fine, so I rode it home. Came to a slight bump in the road whilst in first gear, and then the rear wheel spokes decided the derailleur looked tasty, caught the mech and bent it all the way up, over, in front of and then below the chain-stay. Long story short, it broke. Just in case you hadn't gathered. :P I've repaired bikes for years, but I've never come up to this part; Can I use HeliCoils to place into the bolt holes for where the hanger itself is meant to meet? I cannot bring myself to part with this frame as it was my best friend's, and he had died after riding this bike in a small criterium near me, I brought it up to scratch, offered it to the family to help pay for funeral costs and they decided I should be the one entrusted to look after and care for it. I screwed up big time. Theoretically, HeliCoils should ('should') work in this application; If it works holding brake calipers on cars, it should work for this. But, would there be any other way to fix the threads (which are warped and stretched, not even a thread chaser would work on it!) so I can still use the same bolt size? I don't want to have to bodge it together with a bigger bolt size in a larger, re-tapped hole. In fact, I'm not even sure THAT would work, either. Could I put a big tack weld in where the hole is and then drill the weld out to tap a thread into? (After rubbing the paint back and all, though Aluminium is a pain to weld) I've never tried anything to do with frame/fork work directly, I'm used to fixing bikes, not frames, if you know what I mean by that. Any help would be great, and I'm curious if HeliCoils would actually work. Cheers. 

The spring tension of front derailleurs is not normally configurable. Addressing your difficulty shifting up, have you checked whether the High limit screw is preventing the mech from moving all the way, forcing you to stretch the cable until the shifter reaches the ratchet point? The shifter is normally able to freely pull cable slightly beyond the ratchet point to allow you to ensure a successful shift, releasing the tension until the ratchet point so that the cage does not foul the chain running on the selected chainring. 

Assuming these are Drop handlebars, the second dimension would be reach or drop. On the other hand, as you're buying a complete bike, not just bars, the second dimension is very likely to be stem length. 

If your fork is regularly bottoming out, you need to either increase the spring rate or modify the loading. In the latter case, achieve this by moving your centre of mass rearwards, reducing your speed or modifying your route such that your inertia has a greater component away from the surface... use the first root to jump over, or "float" over, the subsequent roots, depending how much surface-normal inertia you can handle. Most modern forks contain hard elastomer or plastic bumpers to absorb the force experienced when the fork exhausts its available travel, but these bumpers can fail under extreme loads or repeated heavy loads. As for the chain-slap, rear mechs containing clutches such as Shimano's Shadow+ models can help reduce the motion. (Note, Shadow models, without the plus, have no clutch mechanism) 

The Mega is not a single mass-start race. There are qualification stages on the days preceding the main event. You might get an entry into the Mega, but if you don't qualify, that's a very expensive learning experience! 

Based on these figures, I would calculate the following values for your chosen Spoke Length Calculator: 

If your BB uses a threaded interface, there will be a tool interface. For Shimano Hollowtech II style cranksets, threaded BBs sit outboard of the frame with notches needed by the tool clearly visible.
