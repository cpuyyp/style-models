ie because we live in a world which has change, and this has parts, then we are committed to descriptions which too have parts. So we know our description of 'meanEd' will have parts; the minimal number must be two; one part will have the capacity to cause change - the subject; the other the capacity to receive change - the object But this isn't the division in definition that you ask: subject - object; but rather that which qualifies: object - qualifier In linguistic terms, the object is named - so a name - and so a noun; and the qualifier is descriptive, and in two ways, either attributively and so an adjective, or predicative via a linking copula - in English, 'is'. 

Supposing mathematical objects are real and not fiction - then they have no energy - they cannot as they are not in this world. Yet as ideas in our own minds they visibly have causal efficiency. But we never see the bare mathematical 5, say; it is always incarnated within a mind. This is the position, roughly of fictionalism. But given that your standard of truth is Physics - let me take an example from there: We never see the bare quark; Nature has arranged it such that we see them in triples. Their bare existence is only inferred. But existence, by general consensus has been awarded them. So, by analogy - can we say that although numbers are never seen on their own, but hosted by a mind in a human body - can we then award bare numbers existence. Perhaps not, but it is at least thought-provoking (if not provocative). We can go a step further. Does thought or qualia have energy? Descarte famously divided thought from matter and philosophers struggled to put them back together again. Spinoza made an attempt where they were two modes out of an infinite number of modes of a substance that he identified as God. In Islamic theology, the world is a creation of Allah and returns to him. Does energy apply to Allah? The theologians would say not - as energy is a created concept. In Taoism, the Tao is eulogised and described. Does the Tao have energy? It has causal efficiency as it can be known and experienced; but also it does not - causal efficiency is a term from Western Philosophy and sits very uneasily with how the Tao is said to govern. 

There is a significant philosophical problem with the common viewpoint of many set theorists. Namely, the notion of "set" was supposed to capture the notion of "collection". If really there is some set-theoretic universe that satisfies ZFC, then that universe itself is a collection, and clearly the ZFC axioms do not correctly capture that. MK (Morse Kelley) set theory does not solve that, because again there is no class of all classes. In any case, there is no non-circular philosophical justification for ZFC, so ZFC is in fact a red-herring in discussing Russell's paradox. Discarding axioms on reaching contradiction Finally, I want to point out that it is not viable to simply discard axioms that lead to contradiction. For a simple example, if PA is consistent then PA+¬Con(PA) is also consistent, but proves a false sentence (under the standard interpretation of natural numbers in the real-world). This clearly shows that mere consistency is nowhere near enough to make a logic or formal system meaningful, and we must have some kind of soundness. At the least, we ought to have arithmetical soundness (at least at human scales). 

The particular classification science you are looking for when elaborating tree-like structures is cladistics: it is an approach to classification in which units are grouped together based on whether or not they have one or more shared unique characteristics that come from the group's last common ancestor and are not present in more distant ancestors. Therefore, members of the same group are thought to share a common history and are considered to be more closely related. Its born out of taxonomy. The determination of what counts as a unit here is a species which is properly & fruitfully designated as those organisms that can inter-breed with each other. However, additionally, perhaps the french philosophe Deleuze thinking may be helpful here. He draws a distinction between aborescent & rhizomatic thinking. That is tree-like and network-like. As you observe tree-like classifications are everywhere in different scientia, but this tends to be because of the simplicity of the description. That is the tree is neither too simple or too complex that it is almost useless as as classification. For example, one can plot the sciences on a line such as: biology -> chemistry -> physics; this of course captures one important dimension of scientific ontology, but misses out many others. For example the human sciences do not even appear on this classification line. Such simplicity leads to caricature. There being no dimension of time doesn't show the budding of new sciences, nor loss or ossification of old sciences - what happened to alchemy? That is intensities are missing. The tree of life determined by taxology determines how species are descended from each other. Its modern incarnation is cladistics which uses gene-determined information. Now, looking at the traditional classification of languages, philologists have determined several trees. The Indo-European, Semetic or Sinitic language families. But of course there is word adoption, algebra from al-jabr, sin from sinus etc; meaning drift such as gay as in happy to gay as in queer. That is again intensities, connections, divisions and history are missing. The rhizomatic picture is a philosophical concept devised to fix this obsession with trees. To stop thinking tree right out-of-the-box and think out-of-the-tree and towards some new picture. This picture opens up new horizons wheras the tree anchors - for example the archaic controversy as to whether Indo-European languages has an originary point is plausibly driven by the very form of the picture of a tree; one might instead theorize multiple diffuse sites, flows & mutations. One might suppose with the greater computational & data technologies at hand one needs a more sophisticated understanding of classification that elaborates and constructs a typology from the point (no classification) to the rhizome (all significant determinations & dimensions captured). Both these ends being ideal ends - there being no point to the point - and the rhizome always escaping. 

So your professor's answer is actually not precise enough to determine whether he is using the purely rigorous definition. There is a third possible definition, where a polynomial is a function of the form ( x ↦ a + b * x + c * x^2 + ... + d * x^n ), where "+" and "*" can be overloaded and "x^k" is just a short-form for the k-fold product of "x". Such a function will be undefined or crash if given an input x for which any of the multiplications or additions are not defined. In this sense "x" is not really meaningless but is in fact a parameter name. Of course, one can use a different parameter name (as long as it is not used elsewhere) without changing the meaning. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is very difficult to formalize with all the overloading, but it actually corresponds quite closely with how we informally reason. It is actually not too hard to use the formal definition to capture this notion, via the evaluation map on univariate polynomials over R (where R is a ring), that maps each such polynomial p and object x in R to the value ( a + b * x + c * x^2 + ... + d * x^n ). Similarly for multivariate polynomials. The only thing is that we always have to use this evaluation map to 'apply' a polynomial to some object. People naturally create the short-hand "p(x)" for the above value, despite this conflicting with the formal definition! (By the formal definition, p(1) would be the coefficient of the linear term, but by the convenient short-hand p(1) would be the sum of all the coefficients!) 

Mathematics, at least when I was at school, would be notionally attached to the famous (or infamous) Platonic dicta 'let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here' which turns out, to stretch a term, an urban myth; and possibly more due to the nature and vagaries of the English pedagogical tradition. There is, in fact a Platonic Dialogue, Theatatus where Socrates asks Theodorus, a mathematician that hailed from Cyrene, a colony in North Africa, to recommend any students of his that would make promising philosophers; he does - the eponymous Theatetus. Given his description: 

And to be contrasted with the abolition of classes, and distinguished from the equalisation of classes where labour and capital are harmonised. Kant follows Rousseau in arguing that that the poor have a right that the wealthy should be taxed are arguments not based on considerations of equality but on their right to freedom and independence as their own master and not being coerced by the arbitrary will of another. Marx agrees with this intuition. 

The correct objection is that we cannot talk about something we have not defined, and we cannot talk about something that satisfies some description unless we have shown that there is such a thing to begin with! Thus any sentence that contains "this sentence" is simply a string of words without meaning. Quine's paradox But there is another paradox that completely avoids any circularity. Consider the following sentence Q: 

The question actually boils down to the question of whether or not there is a single underlying reality. Science assumes that there is, and recognizes that what we observe is merely a shadow of a slice of that underlying reality, since we can only hope to observe a very small part of the whole world, and our observations will not be a perfect representation of the real thing. The laws of nature then refer to the rules governing the underlying reality, not what we observe or the scientific hypotheses that we make. The problem with discarding the assumption that there is an underlying reality is that there is then no consistent worldview. You would have to grant that it is absolutely true that something exists, even if there is nothing you can say about what kind of thing exists. Since the negation (that nothing exists at all) is absolutely false, you can see that the fact that something exists is indeed one aspect of the underlying reality. Since it is rather evident from Science (even if not absolutely provable) that the underlying reality is governed by laws, your question of what enforces the rules themselves is a very astute one. Clearly something must, otherwise there is nothing to bring about the governance in the first place. We must conclude then that the totality of all the laws governing reality must both govern and enforce itself, since anything that governs that totality must be included in it by definition. Note that this totality includes even laws that govern other laws. From this point, the atheist concludes that the world explains or creates itself. In contrast, the theist concludes that there is a conscious lawmaker called God that made and enforces all the laws for certain purposes, who is self-explanatory (such as being called "I will be what I will be" in Abrahamic religions). The only difference is essentially whether the self-explanatory core is conscious (whatever that means). And the agnostic thinks it cannot be known. Note that all have to accept that it is perfectly consistent to have absolutely nothing at all exist, but it is simply a fact that our world does exist. Whichever viewpoint you choose, it would be difficult to imagine just how the laws are enforced, but certainly it is not by computation in the sense that we are familiar with, and so your reason of rejecting the existence of underlying laws is flawed because you assume that something must compute that way. To give an (imperfect) analogy, a machine works in a specific way because its parts and programming forces it to work that way. If you did not see those constituents, it does not change the fact that it is governed by them, and in fact you can often infer not only the existence but the nature of those constituents to a certain extent just by observing the way the machine works. This is science. The difference is that there is some fundamental part of reality which governs itself, which science may never reach, and that is part of the next point. The observations that we can make in our world may not be able to probe much of reality. This is almost certainly true if we use only scientific experiments, because experiments are incapable of distinguishing between many different hypotheses that are consistent with all the observations but contradict each other. This problem cannot be eliminated because there are infinitely many hypotheses that can 'explain' everything we have observed but differ in places we have not or cannot observe. For example, you could have been constructed by some laws just one second ago and implanted with memories that make it seem as if you have existed for much longer. It is consistent, but no experiment can refute it. This is where we need logic and philosophy to guide our hypotheses and so we choose the simplest ones that explain all our current knowledge. It is highly likely (and history has repeatedly confirmed) that the underlying reality will always be more complicated than the simplest model we construct for our current knowledge, but that does not mean that we give up and do not construct any model at all just because we will never get it. We make models of the world with the main purpose of being able to predict roughly how the world will behave in the future, so that we can take appropriate actions now. For instance, we give food and water to people who depend on us because we predict that they require food and water to live. And so far, at least this necessity of nourishment seems to coincide with the underlying reality! 

Rosa Luxembourg in The Accumulation of Capital describes & investigates the constant and fixed capital of Marx & Smith respectively. With Marx, she says Constant capital is the value invested in the means of production. In Chapter 2, she writes: 

Hegel points out that pure freedom is essentially identical to pure lack of freedom; to have all possible freedoms is, in a sense, to have no choice at all; freedom to mean anything must have shape and form. 

He doesn't explicitly say, but is it implied that this had an impact on Kantian thought outside of his conception of mathematics. 

One interesting aspect of Kants cultural influence is Asimovs three laws of robotics, and his zeroth law - by which he investigates various ethical dilemmas that the introduction of robots have in human society; these are I would suggest direct or indirectly influenced by the various formulas of Kants categorical imperative. The other possible influence is one suggested by Bardis Fifth Postulate, where he writes that Gauss after reaching the University of Gottingen in the early 19C 

It depends on what you mean by "proposition", but indeed with the right view it is perfectly defensible. 

Well many monotheistic philosophies regard both (the human) mind and matter as created entities, while God himself is uncreated and hence cannot be either mental or physical entities. Some of these philosophers attempt to go further and 'explain' God as having divine essence, while some others insist that we cannot know what God's nature is. Simply put, there are far more types of philosophies than just materialism or idealism or dualism. Even in ancient history some philosophers thought that everything was made of 4 elements, earth, air, water and fire. It may seem ridiculous in the light of modern knowledge, but some of them proposed that things that are composed of only a single element are divine, while those that are composed of more than one element are not divine. Others proposed that the 4 elements are not enough and there is a fifth called aether, sometimes even said to be the essence of the gods themselves (the Greeks had a pantheon). I feel like pointing out that such concepts and terminology arise naturally from humans' tendency to attempt to find patterns where there are none. That explains why people gravitate towards such philosophies that 'conveniently' categorize everything into a few types, the 'best' being two as in dualism. Observe that dualistic ideas do not just come up in philosophical opinions on the human mind, but also in opinions on the structure of the world. In Taosim there cannot be good without evil, light without darkness, heat without cold, life without death, divinity without humanity, ... From science we do know that these are wrong (except the first and last ones which are not scientific claims). For instance darkness is simply absence of light, not an opposing entity, and cold is the absence of heat. There are even certain species that are immortal, contradicting the popular notion that life cannot exist without an inevitable biologically natural death (not due to accident or injury). 

If the infinitely small was also infinitesimal there are arguments first marshalled by Aristotle that this cannot be possible; cohesion is required, thus for a time like thing we need duration, and for a spacelike thing we need extension; though it is perhaps a little strange it is possible to have an infinitely small, but not infinitesimal 'object'; and this can be demonstrated quite rigourously by whats called synthetic geometry. 

I was contemplating Heideggers idea of Being whose Being is a problem. Self-consciousness to me, whilst directly speaks of consciousness that is aware of its own self as a consciousness, also carries an overtone of anxiety of that state of knowledge. Whereas consciousness seems to have only the connotation of being aware of qualia stimulated externally. (As an aside, does Heidegger acknowledge the possibility of Being for which Being is not a problem? For if there is no such Being, why bring that distinction, is it only for distinction?) 

"Only Xs are P" never means "All Xs are P", but rather "The only things that are P are Xs", which is equivalent to "All those that are P are Xs". However, "Only those Xs are P" does mean "All and only the Xs are P". This is because "those" somehow makes the phrase refer to the whole group of "Xs", and so none are left out when asserting that they are "P". In this case, therefore, "Only those who ignore the facts are likely to be mistaken." means "Those who ignore the facts, and no one else, are likely to be mistaken." This is of course false in the real world, since there are people who do not ignore the facts but are mistaken anyway because they are not aware of the facts. But it is exactly what is stated by the English sentence. You then see that the argument is valid, but unsound. So you can say that this question is just a matter of understanding English, not logic. Those who disbelieve my answer can check the Corpus of Historical American English for themselves. To prevent bias, I provide here the first 20 results for the search string ". Only those" in the past 50 years or so. Almost all of them provide unambiguous evidence for the semantics I claimed. The rest should also be interpreted in the same manner.
