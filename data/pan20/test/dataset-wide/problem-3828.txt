Maybe I should give an answer, not just a comment. The following maybe isn't the "correct" way to think about spectral projections, but I find that it helps my intuition. Basically, if $T$ is a normal, possibly closed unbounded, operator on a Hilbert space $H$, then $H$ is unitarily equivalent to a measure space $L^2(\mu)$ and under this equivalence, $T$ is just a multiplication operator by a complex function $f$ (which is bounded if and only if $T$ is bounded). If now $T$ is positive, then so is $f$. The spectral projection $E_{(s,\infty)}(T)$ then corresponds to the projection given by the indicator function of the set $\{ x : f(x)>s \}$. It's then clear that $T E_{(s,\infty)}(T)$ is multiplication by the function $g$ defined by $g(x)=f(x)$ if $f(x)>s$, and $g(x)=0$ otherwise. If $T$, and hence $f$, is unbounded, then so will be $g$. Anyway, I find this mental picture of "it's just multiplication operators" to be handy when dealing with spectral stuff. Martin's arguments are probably "cleaner" if you want a polished version... 

Can't you just use the Lyapunov convexity theorem directly? As usual, identify $\ell^\infty(G)$ with $C(\beta G)$, and work with $\beta G$ the Stone-Cech compactification. As this is a compact Hausdorff space, if $\mu$ is a regular measure on $\beta G$ then an atom of $\mu$ must be a point. So we can decompose $\mu$ as something in $\ell^1(\beta G)$ together with an atom-less measure, say a member of $M_c(\beta G)$ (continuous measures). (Left) translation by members of $G$ give automorphisms of $\beta G$, and hence leave $\ell^1(\beta G)$ and $M_c(\beta G)$ invariant. I claim that nothing in $\ell^1(\beta G)$ can be left invariant. Let $\mu\in\ell^1(\beta G)$ be left invariant. Write $\beta G$ as the disjoint union of $G$-orbits, say $\bigcup_i G u_i$. Then $\mu$ must be supported on finite orbits (else we couldn't sum the coefficients, so we wouldn't be in $\ell^1$). If $u\in\beta G$ with $Gu$ finite, then there is $s\not=e$ in $G$ with $su=u$. Realise $u$ as an ultrafilter. Let $A\subseteq G$ be maximal with $A\cap s^{-1}A=\emptyset$. This means that if $r\not\in A$ then there is $t\in (A\cup\{r\}) \cap (s^{-1}A\cup\{s^{-1}r\})$, which implies that $t=r\in s^{-1}A\cup\{s^{-1}r\}$, that is, $sr\in A$. So $r\not\in A\implies sr\in A \implies r\in s^{-1}A$, so $G=A\cup s^{-1}A$. So Zorn implies there is $A\subseteq G$ with $A \cap s^{-1}A=\emptyset$ and $A\cup s^{-1}A=G$. Then either $A\in u$ so $A\in su$ so $s^{-1}A\in u$, contradiction; or $s^{-1}A\in u$ so $A\in su=u$ contradiction. So I (hope!) I've shown that actually for any $u\in\beta G$, the orbit map $G\rightarrow\beta G; s\mapsto su$ is injective. In particular, invariant means live in $M_c(\beta G)$, and so are atom-less, and so now we can just apply Lyapunov. Edit: As Valerio points out, this shows that $X=\{ (\mu_1(A),\cdots,\mu_n(A)) : A\subseteq\beta G \text{ is Borel}\}$ is a convex set in $[0,1]^n$. Now, each $A\subseteq G$ induces the clopen set $O_A=\{ u\in\beta G: A\in u \}$, and these sets $O_A$ form a base for the topology. Now each $\mu_i$ is regular, so given $\epsilon>0$ and $A\subseteq\beta G$ Borel, we can find $B,C\subseteq G$ with $O_B \subseteq A\subseteq O_C$ and with $\mu_i(C)-\mu_i(B)<\epsilon$, for all $i$ (under the obvious abuse of notation). (This follows as any open set is a union of sets of the form $O_C$, and then approximate with a finite union.) So $Y=\{ (\mu_1(A),\cdots,\mu_n(A)) : A\subseteq G\}$ is a subset of $X$, and is dense in $X$. I don't see right now why $Y$ need be convex. 

Suppose X is an inner product space, with Hilbert space completion H (actually, I'm interested in the real scalar case, but I doubt there's any difference). If H is separable, then so is X, and I can find a (countable or finite) orthonormal basis of H inside X. Indeed, start with some countable subset Y of X which is dense in H. Then, by induction, we can move to a linearly independent subset of Y, and then apply Gramâ€“Schmidt, again by induction. The point (to me, anyway) is that at any stage, we never take limits, and so we never leave X. Now, what happens if H is not assumed separable? I've tried to use a Zorn's Lemma argument, but I keep end up wanting to take limits (or, rather, infinite sums) which gives me an orthonormal basis (in the generalised, non-countable, sense) in H, but I cannot ensure that it's in X. Am I just missing something obvious, or is there a slight technicality here...? 

You have that $T^*:(\ell^2)^* \rightarrow E^{**}$, so using that $(\ell^2)^*$ is isomorphic to $\ell^2$ (just in the linear sense, as we already have a co-ordinate system), we can regard $T^*$ as a map $\ell^2\rightarrow E^{**}$. By the Principle of Local Reflexivity (I've used a paper of Behrends in the past, which is overkill, but is freely available: $URL$ Or look in a book on Banach space theory) for each triple $i=(M,N,\epsilon)$, where $M\subseteq E^{**}$ and $N\subseteq E^*$ are finite-dimensional, and $\epsilon>0$, we can find an operator $S_i:M\rightarrow E$ such that $(1-\epsilon)\|x\| \leq \|S_i(x)\| \leq (1+\epsilon)\|x\|$ for $x\in M$, and with $\phi(S_i(x)) = x(\phi)$ for $x\in M$ and $\phi\in N$. So, let $P_n:\ell^2 \rightarrow \ell^2$ be the projection onto the first $n$ co-ords, let $M\supseteq T^*(P_n(\ell^2))$ and let $i=(M,N,\epsilon)$, so $S=S_i T^* P_n$ makes sense, and is a map $\ell^2\rightarrow E$. Then, for $a\in\ell^2$ and $\phi\in E^*$, $$S^*(\phi)(a) = \phi(S_i T^* P_n(a)) \rightarrow T^*(a)(\phi) = T(\phi)(a),$$ as $i$ and $n$ increase. So we have found a bounded net $(S_d)$ (we can even choose it bounded by $\|T\|$ be rescaling a little) with $S_d^* \rightarrow T$ in the weak operator topology. But now a standard trick (take convex combinations, as the closure of a convex set is the same in the weak and norm topologies) allows us to find a net which converges SOT. I think the proof would work for any Banach space F replacing $\ell^2$, as long as we can find a bounded net of finite rank operators $(F_\alpha)$ with $F_\alpha\rightarrow 1$ SOT. That is, F should have the bounded approximation property. 

Fix $x \in X$ and let $(f_\alpha)$ be a net in $X^*$. For each $\alpha$ let $T_\alpha$ be the rank-one operator $y \mapsto f_\alpha(y) x$. Then you want to compare the seminorms $$ |\langle T_\alpha^*(x^*), x \rangle| = |\langle x^*, x\rangle| |\langle f_\alpha, x\rangle| $$ against $$ |\langle T_\alpha^*(x^*), x^{**} \rangle| = |\langle x^*, x\rangle| |\langle x^{**}, f_\alpha \rangle|. $$ As $X$ is non-reflexive, we can find a bounded net $(f_\alpha)$ which is, say, weak$^*$-null, but for some $x_0^{**} \in X^{**}$ we have $\langle x^{**}_0, f_\alpha\rangle=1$ for all $\alpha$. So the topologies differ. 

Remark 1: Having the "compact approximation property" doesn't seem to help. By definition, this means we can only choose $T$ to be compact not finite-rank. Then the image of the unit ball of $H_0$ under $T$ is a compact set, but I don't know how to form the equivalent of $S$. That is, how do you (linearly) distort a compact set from $H$ into $H_0$? 

1) As Yemon said, just pass to a subnet (via compactness) where it converges. 2) Follow the suggestion in the paper and use Cohen Factorisation. In the form I like, if $A$ is a Banach algebra with a bai and $E$ is a left Banach $A$-module, set $F$ to be the closed linear span of $\{a\cdot x:a\in A,x\in E\}$, then $F = \{ a\cdot x : a\in A,x\in E \}$ (no linear span or closure). So, if $F = \{\pi(f)(x) : f\in L^1(G), x\in E\}$ then $F$ is equal to its own closed linear span, and is (clearly) equal to the collection of $x\in E$ such that $\pi(e_\alpha)x \rightarrow x$. Taka said as much as this in his comment. Now let $P$ be a weak$^*$-limit point of the net $\pi(e_\alpha)$ in $B(E)$. Then $P(x)=x$ for $x\in F$. Also $P\pi(f) = \pi(f) = \pi(f)P$ for all $g\in L^1(G)$, and so for $y=\pi(f)(x)\in F$ we have that $P(y)=y$. Thus $P$ is a (contractive) projection onto $F$. Now prove an identity like $(s\cdot f)g = s\cdot(fg)$ for $s\in G, f,g\in L^1(G)$. It follows that $\sigma(s)\pi(f) = \pi(s\cdot f)$. Hence also $\sigma(s)P=\sigma(s)$. Similarly, $\sigma(s)\sigma(t) = \sigma(st)$. So $\sigma$ restricts to a group representation on $F$. 

To complement Neil's answers: At Oxford and Cambridge you will find things called "Junior Research Fellowships". These are funded by and administered by the colleges (and not the mathematics department). They could be in any subject, or in, say, "Science and Mathematics", or even just "Mathematics" (but it's very unlikely to be more specific). Probably the college will rotate which subject(s) it wants over the years. These position receive a very large number applications, and so some sort of filtering system along the lines Ben suggests must happen. Having strong references is perhaps the most important thing. (I had one of these. I didn't know anyone at the college before, but in the end, a mathematics fellow at the college in question worked in a field rather close to mine, and interviewed me, so presumably understood my work and was sufficiently impressed by it. But the other postdoc in my year at the same college was in a different area, and the college simply invited in an expert from outside to interview him. So my strong advice would be to apply for everything, and get lucky once!) The best guide to these things remains, I think, Tom Korner's: $URL$ I think a few other places in the UK (Warwick? Imperial College London?) might offer one postdoc position a year under a similar format (any subject, best candidate wins)?? 

In particular, $V$ certainly contains states. If $I\subseteq A$ is a right ideal then the annihilator $I^\perp = \{\mu\in A^* : \mu(a)=0 \ (a\in I) \}$ is left-invariant, and so 

Given there are no other answers, let me say something about (1). We need only check continuity at the identity of $G$. Let $(g_i)$ be a net converging to $e_G$. That $\alpha_{g_i}\rightarrow I$ means that for each $f\in C(X)$, we have $\|f\circ\phi_{g_i^{-1}} - f\|_\infty \rightarrow 0$. That $\phi_{g_i^{-1}} \rightarrow I$ means that whenever $K\subseteq X, U\subseteq X$ are compact (=closed) and open, respectively, with $K\subseteq U$, we have that $\phi_{g_i^{-1}}(K) \subseteq U$ for large $i$. (This is a basic open set about $I$ in the compact-open topology). To show that $\alpha$ continuous implies that $\phi$ is continuous, you can use a simple Urysohn's lemma argument (to find a function $1$ on $K$ and $0$ off $U$). Conversely, suppose $\phi$ is continuous, and let $f\in C(X)$. For $\epsilon>0$ we can cover $f(X)\subseteq\mathbb C$ by a finite number of closed discs of radius $\epsilon/2$, say $(L_k)$. Then cover each $L_k$ by an open disc of slightly larger radius, say $V_k$. Then $K_k=F^{-1}(L_k)$ is closed in $X$, and $U_k=f^{-1}(V_k)$ is open, and contains $K_k$. So for $i$ large, by continuity of $\phi$, we have that $\phi_{g_i^{-1}}(K_k) \subseteq U_k$. Thus $f(x) \in L_k \implies x\in K_k \implies \phi_{g_i^{-1}}(x) \in U_k \implies \alpha_{g_i}(f)(x) \in V_k$. Hence $\|f - \alpha_{g_i}(f)\|_\infty$ is small. So $\alpha$ is continuous. I think a good reference for the locally compact case is Dana Williams's book "Crossed Products of $C*$-Algebras". It nicely dots all the is and crossed all the ts. For (2): let $G=\mathbb Z$, so $\phi$ is generated by a single homeomorphism of $X$. Let $X=\{ z\in\mathbb C : |z|\leq 1\}$ and define $\phi(re^{i\theta}) = r^2 e^{i\theta}$. Then $0$ and all points on the circle are fixed; the orbit of any other point $re^{i\theta}$ has accumulation points $0$ and $e^{i\theta}$. Let $f\in C(X)$ be invariant; translate so $f(0)=0$. Then $f(re^{i\theta}) = \lim_n f(r^{2n}e^{i\theta})=0$ for all $r<1$, so by continuity $f=0$. Thus the action $\alpha$ is "ergodic", but $\phi$ has non-trivial invariant open and closed sets. Edit: An easier example has $X=[0,1]$ and $\phi(s)=s^2$. Then $\{0\}, \{1\}$ are non-trivial fixed closed sets, and $(0,1)$ is an invariant open set; but again $\alpha$ only leaves the constant functions invariant. 

I don't know if this counts as "simple". But $V$ is Banach if and only if, whenever $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $B$, and $\sum_n \|x_n\|<1$, then $\sum_n x_n$ converges in $V$ (and necessarily to something in $B$). Now, you can phrase this convergence purely in terms of $B$. You need that there is $x\in B$ such that, for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that $\epsilon^{-1}(x - \sum_{n=1}^N x_n) \in B$. That doesn't seem super-simple to me. 

It's a big, famous, hard problem in operator algebras to determine if the von Neumann algebras $L(F_2)$ and $L(F_3)$ are isomorphic, or not. Here $F_n$ is the free group on n generators and $L(F_n)$ is the weak-operator-topology closure of the group algebra $\mathbb C[F_n]$ acting naturally on the Hilbert space $\ell^2(F_n)$. I presume it must be known if the algebras $\mathbb C[F_2]$ and $\mathbb C[F_3]$ are isomorphic or not. But from casually asking a few algebraists, I've never had any luck in finding this out (I admit to not working very hard on this!) I'm guessing some (co)homology theories must help...? What about for replacing $\mathbb C$ by a more general ring? 

If $(a_n)$ is a sequence in $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$ which converges weak$^*$ in $\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)^*$, then $f(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence for all $f\in \ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$. Now, $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$ is weakly sequentially complete (*) and so there is $a\in\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$ with $f(a_n) \rightarrow f(a)$ for each $f\in\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$. In other words, the weak$^*$ limit of $(a_n)$ actually lives in $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$. So the answer is "no" in a strong sense. (*) All preduals of a von Neumann algebra are weakly sequentially complete (see Takesaki I, Chapter III, Corollary 5.2). There is presumably an easy proof for $\ell^1$, but I don't know a reference off the top of my head. Edit: The following is prompted by Bill Johnson's comment (and reveals nothing so much as my own ignorance!) A Banach space $E$ is said to have the Schur Property if weakly convergent sequences are norm convergent-- Schur originally showed that $\ell^1$ has the Schur Property. We say that $E$ is weakly sequentially complete (WSC) if whenever $(x_n)$ is weakly Cauchy (meaning that for each $f\in E^*$, the scalar sequence $(f(x_n))$ is Cauchy) then $(x_n)$ is weakly convergent. The Schur property implies WSC-- if $(x_n)$ is weakly Cauchy, then for any increasing sequences $(n_k)$ and $(m_k)$, the sequence $(x_{n_k} - x_{m_k})_k$ is weakly-null, hence norm-null, and hence $(x_n)$ is norm Cauchy. You can find all this in Section 2.3 of Albiac and Kalton's book. For a general measure $\mu$, the space $L^1(\mu)$ is WSC, but doesn't necessarily have the Schur property-- see Section 5.2 of this book.
