There are many good replies here. Read them a few times and consider carefully what everyone is saying. Based on my experience-- I totally lacked any fitness when I began to ride again as a middle-aged adult-- the hill you're trying to ride is a little ambitious, if you're carrying a few extra pounds and your fitness has not been developed sufficiently. However, as everyone has indicated, it totally do-able, given enough time and effort. And you're not riding some vintage road bike with a 42/26 lowest gear (which clocks in at 42 gear-inches, about twice as much as your actual lowest gear, which comes in at 19.9 gear-inches). I have a couple of similar climbs near where I live (both about 0.4 miles, one with an average grade of 3%, and one with an average grade of 8%), and when I first started riding, I could just make the 3% grade, using the lowest gear on my vintage mountain bike (very similar to what your bike has), and it was a good long while before I attempted the 8% grade. On one of my first attempts of the 8% grade, I was passed on the way up by a female jogger, and she must have noticed how hard I was breathing, because I was really laboring. But over time, I kept riding, and now it's not that much of a big deal to do the 8% grade. So, keep riding, and I think you'll find that this climb becomes less intimidating very soon. 

As long as you have a ten speed chain it should be fine. Presuming this is FC-M675 or FC-M677, use the 8.5mm bolts from the inner ring. The 7mm ones from the outer are below Race Face's recommended bolt length. 

The part with the two notches is left-threaded, so clockwise to loosen from the perspective of your picture. It should be noted that these are quite the can of worms once apart, and cleaning/lubrication can be done pretty effectively by taking the whole freehub body off using the 10mm internal Allen wrench flats (poke a 10mm Allen into the hole in the center of the freehub; that part is normal threaded). Then on the back you'll find a rubber seal. Carefully pry that out and keep track of its orientation. Then you can easily blow or drip air or whatever lubes/cleaners you want into the mechanism. The one thing that can't be done this way is take advantage of the seldom-discussed cassette play adjustment that Shimano freehub bodies have. To do that you remove one of the thin shim washers you find inside the freehub internals. If you do take it apart you must answer the question of what you're going to use to keep the ball bearings in place when putting it back together that's also not too thick for the purpose. You don't want regular bearing grease in there because it can gum up the mechanism. The main thing I know that works is a thin layer of Slick Honey or similar very light grease. 

It doesn't take much of a change in the stem length to make a difference. Long story short, I changed my saddle and my bars, and started getting horrible back pain after 40 miles or so. I shortened my stem by 30 mm, and all is well. I can ride 70 miles or more before I start feeling any pains, but back pain is not one of them, typically. If you can't post pics of your bike, measurements would be helpful for you to know. In addition, check your bike vs. a fit calculator like this one. Make sure you're in the range of numbers before you start throwing money at this problem. 

If you're able to upload the ride to Garmin Connect, or Strava, you can get an estimate of calorie burn on the basis of speed, elevation, and so forth. If you were wearing a heart rate monitor, the estimate from Garmin will be much more accurate, but unfortunately at this time Strava does not factor heart rate into their calorie estimate. 

I heard an interesting opinion yesterday that said all freewheels made back in the day (we were discussing this over a wheel with a Maillard hub and a Maeda (?) freewheel). The shop mechanic said that because it was made in the hey-day of freewheels, it was automatically better than anything made today, in which everything freewheel is being slowly phased out. Now I've tried out mountain/hybrid bike freewheels on a road bike, and I liked the ramps and such, but do the older freewheels (especially entry-mid level ones) really hold that much over modern freewheels? This may sound a little opinion based, but I'm know there's a factual answer out there comparing weight, usability, durability, features, and other technical attributes which make a difference to general, everyday performance. Also, I'm strictly comparing members of the thread-on class, not discussing the merits of cassettes and free-hubs and other modern technology. I tend to run a lot of older technology by virtue of it being cheaper to pick up and cheaper to replace when my daily is stolen and cheaper to maintain myself. 

New road bikes are generally available from two sources: your local bike store (LBS) and online. Not all brands are available from both types of distribution channel. That makes it harder to compare apples to apples. Too, your LBS/brick & mortar retailer probably has a clearance sale starting sometime around August where they attempt to clear out inventory, so they can make space for next year's models. If you want to compare apples to apples, keep that in mind. You can get some very good deals in this way, which can be hard to beat online. The online-only sellers almost never have any kind of substantial sale. In light of that, let's look at a couple of examples. Lynskey Helix with full Ultegra drivetrain ($4950 assembled) vs. BikesDirect Motobecane Le Champion with full Ultegra drivetrain ($2100 assembled). These bikes are very comparable in many respects. Both have a titanium frame, but the Lynskey frame is made in the USA, whereas the Motobecane frame is made in Taiwan. The Lynskey frame has a certain cachet among cyclists which the Motobecane frame does not have. If you were to compare the two frames side-by-side, you may find that the welds on the Lynskey are slightly prettier than the welds on the Motobecane. (The frame builders at Lynskey might be using multiple layers of weldment to help achieve that.) The other components are pretty comparable; I own and have ridden many miles on both the Aksium and Equipe wheels, for example, and there isn't much difference. The fork on the Lynskey is nicer and more expensive, but apart from that, all the components are entirely comparable in terms of price and quality. You can read online reviews of both bikes, and they both review favorably. The price for the Lynskey, however, is $2850 more. This is sort of an apples-to-apples comparison, in that both bikes are available online and you can get them through certain dealers. Take another trio of road bikes and compare: Trek Madone 4.7 with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3150 MSRP) vs. Specialzed Tarmac SL3 Expert with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3900 MSRP) vs. Motobecane Immortal Force with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($1600 MSRP). Look at the specs for each of these; you have nicer wheels on the Specialized, and there are other differences. But all the frames are made in Taiwan, so far as I know. A big part in the price difference comes from paying for the distribution channel. The dealer has to make a profit to stay in business. Trek & Specialized are mainly distributed through brick & mortar retailers; BikesDirect has some brick & mortar retailer distribution, but mainly they sell online. Full disclosure: I ride a Motobecane Le Champion with the titanium frame; I have about 4100 miles on the bike, and I'm totally happy with it. I also have a Trek Fuel EX 8 that I scored on clearance from a brick & mortar retailer. So I have no problem to buy either way. Bottom line, you have to decide how much you are willing to pay for brand name cachet and LBS support. But I think it is fair to conclude that the dealer-centric brands cost more. 

You should not be able to. Generally you want your leg fully extended and your foot parallel to the ground at the bottom of your stroke. As others have mentioned, there are allowances to that rule to increase maneuverability, which comes with having a lower saddle, but if you can touch the ground flat footed, and your pedal is 15-30 cm off the ground at the bottom of your stroke, then you can't possibly have an efficient stroke, and you're hurting your knees in the process. One of the strategies to adjusting your saddle is that you ride for about 5 minutes, then raise your saddle about an inch. According to Sheldon Brown, if your bike feels lighter and faster, then that's a good adjustment for you. I raise it by inch or half inch increments, then when it feels like you're over reaching, lower it by only a quarter inch at a time. Give yourself time to adjust. 

Yes, it will work fine. For road cassettes, the freehub body length had to be increased for 11 to fit more cogs, but for mountain there was no such change because the largest cog slightly overhangs the hub flange. 

Yes, this is a reasonably accurate way of doing it. Along similar lines, with the axle supports square with the base and everything reasonably well aligned, you can just use a vernier caliper to measure the distance between the support itself and the rim sidewall. Dish sticks have the upside that they produce a very accurate, fast reading with a simple tool, and because of their nature, the precise dimensions/alignment of the tool itself isn't what makes them accurate. Getting the exact number isn't really what's important; getting a reading that you can trust is reflective of reality is, and dish sticks are good at that. I've found that when doing the same thing the "math" way, either with a ruler or a caliper, it winds up taking longer and being more fidgety. But it's totally fine for home/occasional use. Dedicated dishing tools also have the nice feature that, when they're flipped to the "gappy" side of the wheel being dished and you touch one end of the tool against the rim, the other side is showing you a picture of how much more you have to bring it over magnified about 4x (2x because you're touching the tool to one side of the rim, and 2x because to correct a dishing error of the rim surface being Y distance away from where it's supposed to be, you need to bring the rim Y/2 over to one side.) I think that probably makes it a little easier to get it dead perfect. In other words, they make it easy to see what are actually very small errors in dish, which can be a little hard to pick up on with a ruler or caliper. How much errors this small matter is a separate question of course. 

Old-school racing bikes (I have two) are not as comfortable as old-school MTBs when you resume riding, especially if you have a bit of a gut. The upright riding position that the vintage MTBs offer (or a modern equivalent) is one of those things that can keep you on the bike until riding a road bike becomes more comfortable. When I resumed riding (as a middle-aged adult), I was fortunate to get this at a local garage sale for $20: 

You need saddle time for a century ride, because the only way to train your backside to be in the saddle for four to seven hours is to be in the saddle for longish rides, like three to four hours. A rule of thumb for centuries is that you ought to be able to go 70-80% of the distance about two weeks prior to the century. I would add to that: over similar terrain. So in other words, if your century route includes 4000 feet of climbing, try to find a 70-80 mile training ride that also includes about the same amount of climbing. Try to ride that at the pace you plan do the century at, and let those training rides inform your pace for the century. In other words, if you're thinking you can do the century at 15 mph average, attempt that with your training rides, and see if it is realistic. You don't need to regard your commuting miles as useless, however. If possible, do some intervals while you're commuting. Another thing I might add: long rides require proper intake of nutrition. Personally, I find that I drink a fair amount on long rides. For example, I did a 60-mile ride this morning, and drank about 2.5 liters of water. To keep my electrolytes good, I always add some Nuun tabs to my water when I fill (and refill) my bottles. These tabs acidify the water slightly, which makes it far more refreshing, and they also add electrolytes without adding sugar. You can get some pretty bad cramps on longish rides when you neglect hydration, and that is another purpose of the 70-80 mile training rides: finding out how much you need to drink. You also need to make sure to keep munching on stuff during the ride, like Power Bars or some equivalent. 

They have totally different bolt patterns, 96mm asymmetrical for 8000 and 110mm asymmetrical for 5800. 

In almost all cases it can be made to work fine. The trick to getting there is that because the ring can be a little thinner due to the the narrower ring-to-ring spacing of the crank it's intended for, you sometimes need tiny little chainring spacers/shims to get the centerline of the ring spaced where you want it to be. With a large ring, the other issue that often comes up if you don't have them is the chain may rub on the inside of the new large ring when you're in the middle ring, small cog combos. It's pretty common to see this being the main functional issue in practice. The main flavor of tiny chainring spacers available are the 0.6mm ones from Wheels Mfg and a couple other brands. On paper the .6 can seem like too much, but in practice they tend to work great in scenarios like the one you're in. 0.1mm spacers exist and can be useful for getting things stone perfect, but they're not a standard bike industry item and aren't usually needed. You can get them from industrial suppliers (McMaster etc) if needed. The 0.1s are probably a little more under the radar in the bike world than they should be in terms of usefulness. The other factor is how well the ramps and pins play together. Usually you don't really have a lot of choices here and it works fine anyway, probably because despite being ostensibly different systems, manufacturers have fairly similar ideas about where in the rotation cycle to locate them. (That is my speculation.) I often gravitate towards using rings intended to be generic replacements, such as the ramped and pinned ones from US distributor house brands Origin8 and Dimension, and tend to get fine results with those. On the other hand, for commuter bikes with 104/64 BCD in particular I often try first the Deore/Alivio level steel rings from Shimano, which are cheap, work good, last a very long time, and can usually be made to work well on any crank of the right BCD. 

This question has been nagging me for ages. I've read a lot of Sheldon Brown's site and actually tend to use bikes from the 70s-80s because they're more economical for daily use and especially for a student like me. But I've noticed that some of his opinions can be controversial (his discussion of "lawyer lips"), can fly in the face of industry practices (that all leather saddles, 'properly cared for', are better than any plastic saddle), questionable (that the Peugeot UO-8 makes for the greatest touring bike of all time) and then, sometimes, his opinions seem on a troll level, which I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but have caught myself falling prey to them. A lot of his material is either very enlightening (his discussion of brake usage) or helpful in that you simply can't find the topic anywhere else on the web. So the question is, is Sheldon Brown's site really the one-stop for all knowledge pertaining especially to older bicycles, or should he be taken simply as a prolific writer who wrote on a great many topics and should be taken with a large grain of salt? I guess the real question is, how much do bike mechanics especially and others depend on his work, or is it simply a convenient online resource for people new to the sport?
