Mathematics is commonly held (by mathematicians and others - for example Rexroth a poet, and Pasternak a novelist and poet) to have Beauty; can it also be sublime in all of Kants sense? Sublime in the 16th century was generally understood to mean as: 

A certain position says that the gods themselves are simply a certain particularity of the universal Brahman; each god has many avatars. They are a material, and personal manifestation of the immaterial and impersonal Brahman. Different philosophical schools explain Brahman differently. The gods & their avatars have a complex mythology and philosophy. One example will have to suffice: Vishnu is the preserver; Shiva the destroyer and Brahma the creator. One may wish to consider the parallels between this and Hegels dialectical triad: thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. His triad drives the world-mind. The Hindu triad does likewise for the world itself. 

I don't see how your conclusion follows:It could then be argued that this type of selfless act should be avoided. Your example is designed to lend credence to your conclusion. A comparable example would be Susan not enjoying concerts nor music, but self-sacrificingly going with Samuel to please him, and over time begins to enjoy it. Is this any more or less likely than the setup you've given? Also the psychology of the situation is a bit simplistic. I suggest an altruistic Susan would give out subtle hints that she's only attending the concert to please Samuel, and that this form would be partly unconcious. Not actively misinforming. 

All of these are vague: It doesn't tell you what to observe and nor how to measure it; or what experiments to make and especially not how to come up with hypotheses. For these one can argue that you need specialist knowledge of a discipline, its history and its methods; this constrains the above more tightly, nevertheless they are still left open to a degree. (It's probably also worthwhile to point out that they need to be vague in order for scientific progress to be possible). 

The following is a summary/excerpt of Sorge (Care) in Michael Innes Heideggers Dictionary. Heidegger uses three cognate words in the description of Care: 

In the ancient theorisation of the body politic, social and economic there was a four-fold distinction between priests/philosophers, warriors/kings, merchants/artisans and labourers/slaves (Platos Republic and the Rig Veda). Marx collapses these into two in the modern era: Labour vs Capital Arendt is making a similar distinction but theorising it differently - don't capitalists 'work'? She distinguishes Labour from Work: Labour is connected to neccessity and the entirely conditioned will; to being a means - ie to tools, to unconstructive and property-less work (for them); to slaves and to animals; it is connected too to inaction; to the lack of speech; thus vita laborans. Work is connected to freedom and the unconditioned will - free-will; to being an end; to constructive property and being property-owners and to citizens; to being human; to be human is to act. Thus vita activa. So whilst, Marx as a theorist of the economic order theorised a duality: Labour vs Capital; Arendt distinguishes between Labour vs Work. Her main observation is that in the ancient polis labour was small-scale and restricted to the house-hold ie the private realm and did not dominate the public order which was the realm for politics: for the free discourse of citizens; for her this labour has escaped the private realm and entered the public sphere. To answer your final question: work being aligned being aligned with what is human in us has the higher dignity. 

There are two kinds of mass, inertial & gravitational. Inertial mass tells you has resistent a particle is to motion, gravitional mass tells you hard strong gravity pulls. It was a puzzle as to why these two kinds of mass were exactly the same. It was Einstein who used this equivalence to physically conjecture General Relativity. Mass as condensed energy just means that energy can too be the source for the gravitational field. The weak force is a gauge field, and as particles, the force is carried by bosons, which like all bosons are massless. But this would mean that the range of weak force is infinite; experimentally this isn't true. One then suppose that the boson must carry mass. The question is where this mass comes from. Its comes from interactions with the Higgs field; and the Higgs boson is the interaction of these two fields - the Weak & the Higgs. As wikipedia puts it: 

ie no inter-subjectivity, or inter-objectivity - thus a loss of reality: reality deprived of realness becomes autistic; and the spectator solipsistic. How seriously is Gabels critique taken now? And is this one input in Deleuzes Capitalism and Schizophrenia? 

Here he describes the robust health & vigour of man, and the children of men following their example. 

This is more on the lines of commentary on your question, rather than an answer. If one uses the usual natural numbers then yes. But are there other systems of natural numbers? 

Modernity is a complex phenomenon coming out of the Enlightment and earlier roots; one aspect of it is the Industrial Revolution and the increasing pace of technology as identified by Heidegger. The division of labour in contemporary classical economics is an outcome of the self-regulation of the market-place (and thus society) by the invisible hand. This metaphor was developed by Adam Smith to explain the self-regulation of market-place; in all his works he uses the metaphor three times; first in his Theory of Moral Sentiments: 

after the industrial carnage of WWII and the holocaust; the dream had turned into a nightmare. Art is a reflection on our place, as human beings in the scheme of things; as is science, nevertheless the subjects are as distinct as the fingers on one hand; an artist may make take science as a subject, and a scientist may liken his work to art as art is more immediately accessible; yet knowing Maxwells equations that describes how electromagnetic radiation radiates does not tell us how light, colour, line, shape and mass affects sensibility; the latter is our common human inheritence; it is with sensibility that artists work with and not sense - which does not mean that they lack sense. 

How can we predict what genetic success means, and for whom? For yourself, for the species, for life in general? Morality is a characteristic of the human species as they are self-conscious creatures. As morality is pervasive amongst the human species one can posit that it is a species advantage. In the same way that for example language or music is. 

One possibly useful example to hold in mind is Chomskys notion of grammar as an inate idea: we aren't born speaking French, English or Bengali - we learn it, surely; but our knowledge or understanding of how grammar works, Chomsky holds is inate - it's for this reason he expects there to be a universal grammar - for surely any man could conceivably learn any language. An example of an a priori idea, is that 2 + 2 is four; again this is something we learn - I remember learning how to add numbers - but when we understand why it's true, we find that it's true not contingently (because of experience, like this blue cup before me is coloured blue - for I can imagine it otherwise) but universally - which has a family resemblence to Platos theory of forms or of universals - it's this universal character that is called a priori. 

Hume wrote some of his works in the style of a Dialogue following Platos lead; has any-one since? Or is it all prose? 

There seems to me a clear correspondance here. Of course, it could mean that both paradigms evolved independently from some prior philosophy. I'm thinking of Leibniz rather than Kant, from whom Saunders MacLane, one of the two cofounders of Category Theory, purloined the word 'Category' for his own uses. He also studied at Gottingen, which from my limited knowledge of German philosophical history, was a centre of philosophy, presumably due to Kant. Some more evidence from Structuralism, by Sturrock: 'What is a structure, then, for Husserl, and 'in general'? The broadest definition is that a structure is an abstract model of organisation including a set of elements and the law of their composition...What stands out in a structure is that the relationships between the elements are more important than the intrinsic qualities of each element'. and the definition of a category can be further elaborated as: 3.Morphisms between objects (i.e. the relationship) follow a law of composition. 

What interests me is this last sentence of Russell - 'language is always more or less vague'; intuitively it seems true because of the four terms together present this truth. That is a logically perfect language cannot be psychologically true, and is essentially a fragment of language and not its ideal. Take this lyric fragment from the Beatles: 

In the usual propositional logic, proving a contradiction means that one can prove any other proposition; this on the face of it , and when one turns it over is quite strange - and there are modern paraconsistent logics that attempt to circumvent this. Does Aristotelian logic, as Aristotle used it, suffer from the same problem? 

Human languages are appropriate for what they're used for; in what they've evolved for, which is to facilitate communication in our every-dayness, that is in our usual mode of living: ordering pizza, arranging to meet up with a friend, getting a doctors appointment and so on. In specialised domains of life where more precision matters then language adapts, in say logistics; but science (or natural philosophy) too is a specialised domain, and in there we have theorising about time - from Aristotle to Einstein; and language here includes the hieroglyphics of mathematics (but possibly not diagrams - these being more pictorial). The model of time that you're interested in, the physical one modelled in physics is not the only one: there is, I think on ontology of time by Bergson where on the present (la duree) exists; the past and the future do not; so here time continuum doesn't exist. In Newtons sense of time, it is time that flows (and it flows uniformly); so objects do not in a sense move in time; this is fundamentally different from how they move in space. The two dimensions - space and time - are ontologically very different; but we do have a time continuum. In Einsteins conception of time, time assumes the spatial character of space; but also our motion takes on the character of time in that our motion is always uniform even when we're standing still; if I move then I move just that bit slower in time so that the two motions when summed come to a constant value (in fact the speed of light). Light for example does not move in time at all, it just moves in space (hence it travels at the speed it must - the speed of light). In Einsteins conception there is no sole time continuum, in fact it makes by itself no sense; there is only as Minkowski pointed out, the spacetime continuum. I'm assuming from your use of 'time dilation' that it is Einsteins conception you are probing; so strictly speaking there is no time dimension. So no time continuum.
