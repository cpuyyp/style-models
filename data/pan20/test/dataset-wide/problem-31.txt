Turrets would be very useful. Luann's answer covers most of what I originally was thinking, but after reading other answers, I have a few more. With the turret you can fire at anything that you can point the turret at and isn't blocked by your ship. With a fixed launcher you have to maneuver the ship to point at the target or waste fuel maneuvering the missile to the target. The more fuel your missile has the longer it can track a ship performing evasive maneuvers. Not pointing at the target may also become important as the ship takes damage. With fixed launchers if the area near the launcher is damaged, you will again have to waste fuel to maneuver or present the damage to the enemy. With Turrets you can rotate the damage away and still fire directly at the target. Multiple targets will also be better handled by turrets. Each turret can independently be aimed directly at the target. Multiple fixed launchers will rarely be able to optimally target multiple targets. Exposure time of the missile is decreased if it is fired directly at the target. If the missile has to turn, time to target will be increased, providing increased opportunity to shoot it down or to be destroyed by splash damage hitting the firing ship. 

Setting: Earth, no more than a century in the future. Premise: Certain US soldiers volunteer to receive genetic modifications that grant increased strength, endurance, and healing capabilities. Most of these capabilities are only technically superhuman--they are slightly above what a normal human can achieve. They can't lift cars or punch holes in steel bulkheads. The greatest advancement is their endurance: an engineered soldier can theoretically run at a full sprint indefinitely, given a constant supply of calories and water. Problem 1: The soldiers tend to push themselves beyond their new physical limitations, as they no longer experience the fatigue of a baseline human during exertion, and they do not have evolved instincts for their new capabilities. As a result, an engineered soldier can accidentally raise their heart rate and blood pressure to the point where they'll suffer instant death due to cascading burst blood vessels in their brain. Solution: The engineered features include a pea-sized gland within the soldier's brain, which will create phantom physical sensations to warn the soldier when they begin to approach their limit. If they ignore these sensations (like a buzzing cell-phone over their heart) and get too close to the fatal limit, the gland will instantly render the soldier unconscious, and gradually slow their heart. Question: What are the potential flaws in the warning/killswitch gland? More specifically, what are the potential flaws in a safety feature which will instantly knock a soldier unconscious in a situation where they would otherwise have a very good chance of dying (>90%)? Are there any obvious ways that an enemy force could exploit this killswitch to their advantage? [Edit]Problem 2: Why not use the gland to mimic the fatigue sensation? The genetic engineering technology is still relatively new, and geneticists are able to create very straightforward sensations (ie, a given patch of skin, of a given diameter, will feel like it's buzzing). More abstract sensations, like fatigue, vary wildly from person to person (in terms of brain chemistry), so they've not yet developed a safe catch-all. A second issue with mimicking the fatigue sensation is that soldiers are all trained to push past it as part of basic training (not just in this future setting, but in reality). The difference is that non-engineered--but otherwise healthy and fit--soldiers will typically reach muscle-failure before hitting any fatal heart rate or blood pressure. 

No, they wouldn't be more effective. The biggest issue would be the massive amount of food they would need. A quick search quoted a male can eat around 50 to 75lb of food a day. A typical human soldier can be expected to consume 4500 to 5000 calories per day. This is slightly more than double the calories that a civilian would consume, leading me to expect a gorilla soldier would need to carry minimum of about 100lbs of food for each day. Even at base the amount of food needed would make a logistical nightmare that could easily be attacked. Another issue would be endurance. Being much lighter we would likely be able to outlast the gorilla. Obviously you wouldn't want to go hand to hand with them, but that doesn't happen often. Edit - Nutrient paste probably wouldn't save much in the weight. The issue is the fact vegetation is the main food source. A nutrition bar with lots of calories probably requires foods they may not be able to handle. I found an article on zutrition.com listing 8000 calories as the daily requirement for a adult male gorilla. That is three to four times what you would feed a human soldier. The issue here is the only advantage gorillas have is strength. Strength is not a big plus in the modern military. The only thing I might use them for would be to carry equipment for the humans, and I doubt they could actually keep up with the humans. I don't think they could stand upright to shoot for long. Humans can and do move and shoot, especially in close combat situations (Think SWAT teams storming a building, they move forward with the weapon in the firing position). Equipment and training are the important factors in modern combat. If you look at many of the battles that have happened in the last 25 years, highly trained troops were able to attain kill ratios above 10 to 1. The Blackhawk down battle is an excellent example. 

Yes Consider the case of Easter Island. The people who lived there believed that their ancestors watched over and provided for them, so they would construct giant heads to ask for help. They built too many heads and ruined the ecosystem because of it, and, unfortunately, their only way of fixing it was to build more heads. Now consider super-colliders. We keep needing more powerful idea to test our theories, so we keep making them bigger and bigger. Imagine a world do wrapped up in whatever they're trying to prove that we use all of the planet's resources. While neither of these events strictly philosophical, I do believe that such a failure would have resounding effects on the attitude of the people. Everybody worked towards something that failed and now we're going to die soon and there's nothing left to party with. 

The alien is actually a collection of life-forms. Once your hero starts removing that armor, oh boy. Her arms and legs are some sort of worm, connected to a circuit board in her chest that sends electrical signals to make them bend. The life-form in her helmet controls the whole operation, but it gets its energy from the waste of its legs/arms. With a piece of her armor in his hand, he worries that he's broken her forever. Her face is quite pretty, and with well evolved anatomical parts, he can almost believe she's one species. 

Both the first and second generation androids could wirelessly connect to data servers via a global satellite network and share learned skills with other androids worldwide. 

Question: Roughly how much time would it take for a government (such as the US) to build a single, self-sustaining, underground shelter capable of supporting 10,000 people? 

Depending on the specific setting/tone you're going for, maybe something as simple as a simplified "third eye" would be enough: 

I'm going to try and tackle my suggestion in pieces, so you can pull from it whatever might be useful: The Height of Human Civilization At the peak of the civilization's technical achievement, they had nanotechnology, almost perfect medical scanners, and the comfort of knowing that all the heavy lifting would be handled by androids piloted by almost human-level AI. Almost every single of the world's twelve billion inhabitants had at least one android. Life was great. There was no middle or lower class. There were no slums. There was no "need" or "want"; only "have". People pursued whatever endeavors whey wished, and even had romantic relationships with android replications of whomever they wished. 

Yes Technology allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do otherwise, as well as make what we can do easier. My opinion is that any civilization that attempts to enter space will have a fundamental drive to do one or both of these things. Progress is inevitable. Particularly in the case of space flight, where you're trying to skim as much weight off of things as possible. I'm having a tough time playing devil's advocate with myself. On the one hand, I try to think about a world with less competition, less of a hurry. However, I'm getting stuck with that one person who looks at a room full of vacuum tubes and doesn't think "there has got to be a better way". How did they get the room full of vacuum tubes if they were happy with pen/paper? 

Steam Engines The aeolipile is the first recorded use of steam as power we know of, having been recorded in the 1st century AD. Other notable points in history: people using fire and cooking 2 million years ago, fire being commonplace 125 thousand years ago, pottery 30 thousand years ago, and simple machines in 3 BC. Even without slavery, I think there is a good case for saying that at some point, somebody in early times would figure out how to control heat pressure. Something like "Why did that clay bowl explode in the fire?".
