That's not necessarily the case, as your friend has pointed out. One can have a belief in the general trustworthiness of a person, and thus be inclined to believe any future propositions made by that person, without any regard to the propositions in question. However, this is still operating at the level of folk epistemology. If you want to move this discussion to a more properly philosophical domain, you're going to have to make reference to a particular epistemological school of thought. 

Start going about town ranting and raving like a lunatic while declaiming all authority and you''ll be fine. 

There seems to be a moral sensibility presented by the author through the use of the term "promise." Since a promise is something that will happen in the future I think the author needs to use a more accurate term. Kant wanted to "rebalance" truth since there is no duty to tell it and indeed an infinite number of reasons not to (to protect your buddies on the battlefield for example.) So how do we achieve our HIGHER calling of "informing on the matter accurately"? Obviously Kant is quite strict on this matter as he sees (correctly) the need for not just the truth but for the truth to " get to the top."(Fog of War for example...or perhaps informational disadvantage in the current context.) So the "residue" does indeed become a contradiction because me and my "posse" are probably going to have to lie to survive in this thing called life...but I still owe my Tribal Chief something too otherwise I might not even have my posse without my Chief. That's my take on the "categorical imperative" as presented here namely "more than a promise." Is it a duty? The author does not elaborate sadly. 

I think the most concise (and yet still useful) explanation you are likely to find is Sartre's brief essay Existentialism is a Humanism. If you read that and still have questions, post them. 

I don't think there is any philosopher who takes a strict tabula rasa position. Naturally, there is a broad spectrum of opinion about the degree of influence attributed to nature versus that of nurture, but I don't think you will find anyone arguing for anything like a pure nurture position that would dismiss the heritability of some traits. 

We are all born weak so I'm unclear about the question other than to say "by protecting the weak"(our children) "we are becoming strong." (a family, a community, a society, a Nation.) Killing children as a policy is usually frowned upon...but certainly "blotting out bloodlines" is quite replete in History...so one answer might be "they're an easy kill." Not all pups all welcome in the litter. 

One approached used by Justice of the US Supreme Court William O Douglas was "the sidebar" whereby a "defendant" would be allowed to approach the Bench first requiring the appellation "if it pleases the Court may I approach the Bench?" whereupon the Judge having agreed to said request you may discuss the matter at hand "in secret." Quite remarkable how much objective truth can be realized from that "deceptively simple" methodology actually. 

The Stoic call to action and kindness is famously illustrated by the Circles of Hierocles. We are taught to imagine ourselves at the center of a sphere of humanity, pulling everyone closer and closer to us, until we care about their needs the same as our own: 

Use indifference and mindfulness to cope with upsets and stressors, unjust behavior on the part of others, and your own tendency to procrastinate and be lazy or careless. Stoic therapy can help make your situation more palatable, despite the challenges Fortune throws your way. Use a love of virtue to push yourself away from lazy inaction, and instead cultivate healthy emotions that motivate you to kindness, activity, good habits, affection for others, generosity, and overall excellence in your work and craft as you pull the circles of the human cosmopolis closer into your sphere of concern. 

You can find a decent introduction here. Is there any particular reason why you didn't do a quick search in the basic encyclopedias first? Imagine what would happen if everyone behaved that way... 

I have not read the book in question, but this seems like a peculiar idea-- how would one deal with children, who do not have the capacity to enter into a contract? And, presuming that one signs such a contract on one's 18th birthday, what happens to those who refuse to sign, or wish to negotiate a different contract? And, since the power differential between the state and the individual is so immense, to what extent could one argue that the contract was not coerced? 

The first known "Political Parties" or "factions" as they were first termed that I am aware of were noted during the ratfication of the US Constitution. "Federalist" Party members were pro Constitution and "anti-Federalist" were against...and this was noted with some alarm during the ratification process as "office seeking" was seen as ungentlemanly. In other words one should asked first before one "becomes President" for example. Alexander Hamilton is the first and only proponent of "ambition" as the pre-requisite for Governing...meaning "do not ask but take." He actually wanted George Washington to be elected President for life in his only appearance before the Constitutional Committee meeting...in secret interestingly...in Philadelphia in 1789. This idea was never considered...but certainly Hamilton's "men of ambition" future was born out...and with it poltical parties. 

Scholars have noted that healthy passions may be phenomenologically very similar to the other passions. The key difference is their cognitive content. They are often still approach-oriented or avoidance-oriented, in modern terms, so they still have a lot of motivational power! As you can guess, the Stoics rejected the passions (1), but they viewed the proto-passions (2) as normal and healthy, and the healthy passions (3) as desirable and essential to the virtuous life. Our main source for these details of the Stoic emotional theory is again Cicero, in his Tusculan Disputations. So yes, you do indeed need to exercise emotional caution in order to make your appointments! But a Stoic would say that this needn't arise from being "stressed," as much as from cultivating a passionate "wish" for virtue: 

The scientific method is very rigourous. It begins in my view with an expectational proof ("no matter in nature can either be created or destroyed") and then proceeds to prove said hypothesis using carefully calibrated instruments and techniques the absolute truth of the hypothesis. In order to secure validity it must be repeatable as well. It is the aposite of "statisical theory" which while critical in an engineering faculty is a dangerous foil when working with items of tremendous volatility or uncertain properties. Controls not just to prove the hypothesis are critical but also to keep the "scientists" from being harmed. For a textbook example read or Google "tickling the Dragon's Tail." 

The Outcome is Neither Good nor Bad, but the Attempt is! It's true, though, that in Stoic theory, it is said that external things are "neither good nor bad." We are taught to value what is within our control, and not to view things like professional success, wealth, or fame as being important to our capital-H Happiness. But the attempt to pursue certain outcomes in absolutely within our control! The Stoics said that external things have a kind of "selective value" (depending on the situation), and that we cannot be virtuous if we do not exert ourselves in pursue of valuable outcomes (namely outcomes that benefit humanity). They were quite serious about this point! In Cicero's De Finibus, we learn that the Stoics thought that people who treated external things as wholly indifferent and rejected even their selective value (namely the Cynics and Aristo of Chios) had destroyed the foundation of virtue. Action matters! Cicero also gives us the famous metaphor of the Stoic Archer: the Archer's goal, he says, is to perform her art well. She shoots at many external targets (which have selective value), but her ultimate goal is simply to do her best. Other Stoics texts make similar analogies to Olympic athletes, pilots of ships, musical performers, and ball players. 

Agree with the comments above concerning such a thing as "Scientific reasoning." There is such a thing as the Age of Reason (circa the late 19th Century) where many of us Westerners thought we had conquered ideas such as War, famine, etc through the use of "Reason" (use of evidence to advance an argument or create a greater bounty for all of humanity as two examples.) Philosophy is never to be bound by what I think they would term "such externalities." Logic is even worse sadly. Of course what is a "reasonable amount of money" is always an interesting point of inquiry....
