Most of the less expensive car/van rear racks are shaped like this: The arms with pads rest against the vehicle and then straps from the center attach to the hatch, trunk and/or bumper. This should work if you attach the straps to the top, bottom and if included to the side of the hatch. You would be able to open the hatch if the bikes are removed first, but it is likely that the hydraulic hatch struts will not keep the door open with the added weight of the rack. If the bikes are on the rack the weight will be significant and you will likely have difficulty opening the door. For a rear rack at allows you to easily open the door and still keep the bikes stored I think your only real option is a hitch rack. 

clipless pedals : buck for buck experience tells me this is your biggest win. It makes a big difference in power transfer. frame stiffness: while bike weight (unless your talking >1kg) isn't going to make much difference, a stiff frame which allows for efficient power transfer will. Changing your bike doesn't seem to be an option for you, but adjusting your seating position and height so you get most effective oomph from your pedalling is worth trying. Aerodynamics makes a big difference for a strong headwind, or at higher speeds. So drop bars, a longer stem, or possibly bar ends could help you out here. Rolling resistance can be a big factor too, and this is a cheap one to improve -- get kevlar bead, high pressure tires with a slick surface (if your current tires have a degree of knobbyness to them, you'll notice a big difference here). Light tires make a much bigger difference than frame weight because of rotational momentum. 

First, at around 10-12 MPH and below you are fighting rolling/frictional resistance enough that the drafting benefit is negligible in still air. If the you have a headwind of 10+ MPH or are traveling at 15+ MPH then there is some benefit to be had. Assuming that there is no wind or a direct on head wind, the extension of the 'drafting bubble' is about 5 - 6 feet beyond the front rider. Any further back than that and neither rider experiences any benefit. Obviously the closer you get the better, but that requires the lead riders cooperation and that the two of you communicate. Since wind is rarely straight on, many times you will be drafting slightly to one side or the other. The impact again is a little less, but you may be safer, as long as you are careful not to overlap wheels. 

Regular maintenance I do this once a week, or daily when riding in inclement weather. That's pretty frequent, but the more frequently you do it, the quicker and easier it goes. You can experiment with frequency depending on your riding conditions, but you should find this is all the drivetrain maintenance you need until you chain wears out, with the gunk-cleaning being a special case. 

In my experience, which is sadly rather high, bike thieves tend to look for shiny, and easy targets of opportunity. Camouflaging your bike as a beater will cause most to simply scan right over it. Incidentally, the following happened to my roommate in Paris, with a brand new $3K mountain bike: He pulled up to a fixture of some sort, leaned his bike against the fixture, and started fishing around in his bag for a lock. Whilst doing so, a thief road up on a beater bike, sprung off said beater, sprung on roommates fancy pride and joy, and road off while my roommate looked on in shock and horror. Probably wouldn't have happened if his bike looked like a beater. A further tip is to look for a good locking place -- somewhere with nice bikes on parade, in view of gendarmarie, or in view of many cyclists (where a thief might suppose you are among said cyclists) are good choices, as is underneath a security camera, such as those typically found in car parks. Finally, workplaces often have a sheltered area where you can lock your bike in relative safety. Last but not least, you can leave the QR for your bike seat, and take the seat with you when you are leaving the bike for an extended time. This tends to be quite discouraging as it both makes your bike look like an abandoned beater, and makes riding off on your bike uncomfortable. 

My experience is that starting with a 7, 8 or 9 speed hub you can usually put a 10 speed cassette on it. Sometimes, especially if you are starting with a 7 speed freewheel, you will need to use a spacer. This is because the sprockets are all significantly more narrow and you need to "extend" the cassette just past the end of the freewheel so that the lockring will properly engage. I've not done a conversion to an 11-speed cassette but my guess would be that it would work the same way. So, you really have two options: 

If you are talking about the things that look like thin, wide plastic washers that go on the outer part of both sides of the bottom bracket, they are called bearing seals. Assuming that you are saying that the bearing seals were not installed, then I would absolutely remove the cranks and install them. They are designed to keep most of the road gunk out of your bottom bracket, helping it to last significantly longer. If you have the appropriate crank puller then you can do it yourself. Remove the cranks, put a light coat of grease on the inner side of the seals and then press them firmly into the bottom bracket. They should seat firmly into an outer groove on the bottom bracket. If you are talking about the clear plastic cylinder in the pic then I don't know what it is officially called, but I think you can do with out it. Not having it may mean that you need to check and tighten your bottom bracket more frequently, but I don't believe it's necessary. 

I also strongly recommend a chain-checker -- a simple little tool for checking chain wear, but you can always just run by your shop periodically to have them check it, if that's convenient. Cleaning a gunky drivetrain I say drivetrain, because it's usually not just your chain that's gunky, the casset, chainrings, and especially derailleur typically get really gunky too. If you're keeping your chainring lightly oiled (defined below) you won't have to do this too often -- after a really muddy ride for example 

Replace all quick release fixtures with tooled fixtures. This is generally a small investment. Take a black marker to all component markings, making all those Deore XT's look at first glance like no-name-brand cheapo components. Either give your bike a crappy paint job -- spray paint some garish, noticeable color. Dont' bother making it beautiful, but make sure any brand markings or indication of quality of bike disappear. An easy alternative here is to wrap the frame in packing tape, which will make your bike look like a beater, but preserve the original finish if you ever want to resell it. Use a good lock, but it should look old and beat up, not like you take your bike too seriously. 

Utah also considered it, but several groups including a large group of experienced bicycle commuters opposed the change. The main reasons are: 

Outside general weight/fat loss, strength and endurance exercises targeting the area will tone the underlying muscles, but will have little to no effect on your spare tire. 

I wouldn't go that far, but play in the stem/headset assembly certainly could have been a contributing factor. Just take a second to imagine to torque and force applied to that small area below the weld when you hit a curb or pothole if the assembly is not tight. The bottom of the headset is somewhat wedge shaped, and if the whole assembly is loose it can be like pounding up on it with a hammer each time you hit a bump. That said - it's a 10 year old aluminum frame and there can be myriad reasons for that failure. 

Also note weight, including rotational weight, only affect acceleration (and maybe climbing a teeny bit), not how much work it takes to maintain cruising speed. Rolling resistance and wind resistance affect what your top speed is. So if your can keep up with your colleagues cruising speed but not acceleration, focus on weight. Otherise focus on aerodynamics and rolling resistance. 

I had one of these. With the exception of the narrow brush (which can be bought seperately), whos curved, toothed end is wonderful for cleaning gunk out of cassettes, I found the tool a waste of money. I wound up throwing mine away. If you're seeing a lot of grime, your problem is almost certainly not the conditions in your area, although this can exacerbate the problem. Rather, you probably leaving too much oil on your chain/drivetrain. The following will work better than the Park cleaner, save you money, and reduce your environmental impact. Equipment needed
