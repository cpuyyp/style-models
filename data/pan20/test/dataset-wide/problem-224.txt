Check this out: $URL$ HAL 9000 is an artificial intelligence. It is true that HAL has monitors to display things. But the "Interaction" part in GUI is verbal. Only when HAL breaks down and loses his verbal communication abilities does he need keyboard input, which Dr. Chandra performs. 

Look at this breathtaking animation of Jupiter herding the asteroids: $URL$ I got an idea from this. Have a star larger/hotter than Sun, where your habitable planet is around 5-8 AU from the star. Have a gas giant closer to the star. And then have an inner planet collide with a rogue planet few 100,000 years ago. The gas giant will herd the debris so your planet will not be affected much. And oh, the rogue planet was crossing the planetary plane, so the debris is not a disk, but a big mass ball of dust, sand, and rocks around the star. 

No, I'm not telling you to plagiarize Alien (1979). But there are qualities you can duplicate: Much like the alien in the Alien, your alien will have to use stealth, speed, agility, and intelligence for its benefit. Tanks lack the stealth and the agility, compared to such a creature. You can add some drama with human overconfidence: soldiers operating the tanks underestimate the alien, probably taking it for a mere animal based on it's looks. BTW this is exactly what happens most of the time in Alien series: hunters becoming the hunted. Tanks will not be able to target a creature that rapidly zig-zags, even in a flat desert terrain. A swarm of tanks would have to take friendly fire if aliens are hastily jumping from one tank to another. Armor piercing biological weapons can be useful, such as the acidic blood from the alien. Alien will be able to pierce armor if it can rapidly accelerate small solid objects. Check how Mantis Shrimp attacks. If the alien can throw metal objects of considerable size fast enough, that's practically a bullet, and they may be able to pierce armor. If alien has a tail, they can use it as a whip to do considerable damage. The ends of a whip can travel at supersonic speeds. It may not be hard to achieve hypersonic speeds if the tail is long and the creatures are very strong. If the and of the tail is made of a really hard substance and very sharp, it might cut metal. Another form of biological weapon to use is poisonous gases. Make your alien produce something like Sarin gas. This can be effective even if the crew wears masks, because Sarin works even in very small concentrations. A leak in a mask, or an overconfident crew member not wearing a mask would be enough to generate a panic situation and make a sitting duck out of a tank. Combining a way to slightly pierce armor and then inject poisonous gas could be effective. Most of the time, the latches on top of tanks are thinner than the armour around the body, and intelligent aliens will quickly realize this. 

If this reasoning is correct, then we should expect to find all five in aliens, provided they evolved as pack animals. Depending how exactly the species looks like and how it operates, some could be stressed much more than the others. If they evolved as mostly solitary animals, they would probably completely lack pillars 2, 3 and 4. (This would be probably the reason why cats in Bobson's answer do not attach to people.) They might be betraying, paranoid, completely unwilling to follow natural leaders or simply indifferent to what others think. But they would probably still be able to feel compassion, or be disgusted. On the other hand, for example the elephant seals live in groups of one dominant male and many females. The males often fight for the females fiercely. If they would develop intelligence, their behavior would probably be very strongly based on authority and the gender inequality (and differences in general) would be probably be near to extreme. The foundations present nice tool for a worldbuilder, since you can analyze patterns of behavior more analytically - you simply decide how strong will each foundation be and then work out the details. But the results will probably not look so alien. 

With these assumptions, we can calculate how does the portal behave now. If previously, we calculated the difference in potential $\Delta \Phi = g h$, now this difference is reduced by the potential gain inside the portal equal to $a_g L$. So we have $$ \Delta \Phi=gh - a_g L\;. $$ With this assumption, now have to update the formula for $m_f$ to $$ m_f=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G}\;, $$ which leads to $$ a_g=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G} \cdot \frac{G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ By solving these two equations, we obtain the final formulas $$ \begin{align} a_g &= \frac{2 d g h}{2 d L+r_g^2}\;,\\ m_f &= \frac{2 d g h r_g^2}{2 d G L+G r_g^2}\;. \end{align} $$ As we can see, with large inner length $L$, the forces near the portals can be made arbitrarily small. It is still true that if you are going from the lower portal mouth to the higher one, you are going "uphill" and you must exert work. How does it look inside the portal? Interestingly, there would be no walls. The space wraps into itself, so it looks like if you are standing between four mirrors: all around, there are images of yourself and of other things inside the portal, just they are not images, but they are really there. You could see your own back. Conservation of Momentum The solution above conserves the energy properly. However, the energy is not the only thing that should be conserved. There is also momentum. With momentum, I do not have any nice idea how to put it into equations. But similarly to the previous case, I guess there would be forces acting on any entering object that change its momentum as it is passing through the portal. The forces would act both on the passing object and on the portal gates. If it is easier to rotate the portal gate so that the object would not change its direction of motion (yes, it could be easy - the portal gates could have negligible inertial mass), they would rotate to a proper position. If they are somehow fixed, the passing object would get strong kick from the portal and its momentum would be transferred to the portal gates. This would definitely not be pleasant experience if you are entering quickly - probably like hitting a concrete wall. Note I do not know if this is the solution you wanted, but it seems quite self-consistent to me. I definitely do not guarantee that it is consistent with the general relativity - it is probably not. (On one side because the portal gates are curvature o space and require extreme exotic mass, which brings additional effects. On the other side because the proposed model is not the only one - I know at least about one more consistent possibility, that is probably the case for wormholes. If you want to go this deep, you should be asking about wormholes, not portals. 

I can answer that! Well...kinda, I can give some ideas. As you might remember from school, plants are green because of chlorophyll, a substance plants use to absorb sunlight to make food. It's green because the most intense color light emitted by Sol is green; if they take in too much at once, then it basically hurts the plant. So green plants are the most efficient at absorbing light from a G-class star. Other such chemical compounds have colors like orange, red, yellow, even purple. These are less efficient than chlorophyll, but they're good for fallback options. These might be better, tho, around other types of stars. Which ones would work best where, I dunno, but it's safe to mention that dimmer stars will, in general, tend to have darker plants. Imagine forests of black trees facing a red dwarf star, absorbing all the light it can... For more info, I'd recommend taking a look at these two videos by MinuteEarth. $URL$ (Part 1) $URL$ (Part 2) 

Hill Sphere Every object has a set gravitational field; you, me, the earth, cheese, and the galaxy all are gravitationally attracted to one another. Gravity though is a function of mass and distance, which means that the larger and closer an object is, the more gravitational pull it will exert. This also means that if an object is moving fast enough, but close enough, or a large center of mass, then it will orbit that mass. This zone is the Hill Sphere. 

I'd say it depends on the climate. Remember, Homo Neanderthalensis and Homo Sapiens were able to coexist on the same planet for a long time before climate change forced/allowed the two groups to come into contact with one another. I suspect that, were it still an Ice Age, we'd still be at least able to live together. Another possibility lies in a civilization from the old game Star Control 2: The Zoq-Fot-Pik. (Bear with me here, this is an old game, and some of its ideas are a bit...eccentric.) 

1. Assuming you're using "Ye Olde Dinosaurs", then those forementioned climactic limits would probably be more in effect. While even Herbivorous dinosaurs could have some extra blubber for those lean times, it wouldn't be enough to live in arctic environments. That'd be where humans would have to set up cities. Farming spots would be prime competition with destructive herbivores; humans would either need to take up herding/ranching, or would be stuck as hunter/gatherers, in small tribal communities.
