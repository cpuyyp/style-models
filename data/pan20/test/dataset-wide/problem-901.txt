meaning that they did have a wider audience than just those who could read Yiddish or who sought out his works. Singer was also well known because he was one of the leaders of the Yiddish literary movement. Doesn't have to be popular As Time Magazine puts it: 

(From the Wikipedia article; unfortunately this particular section is only cited by a dead link to a personal autobiography.) Looking at the Amazon preview/Google book preview of Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson, it says 

What do the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet symbolize, if anything? Mercutio's character mainly provides jokes, and then, in his hot-headedness, is slain by Tybalt. Benvolio at first tries to take Romeo's mind of Rosaline, and then tries to stop the violence between first Tybalt and Mercutio with Romeo, and then between Romeo and Tybalt. He then, after Romeo kills Tybalt, reports to the Prince of Venice what happened. Do these two characters have any special meaning, represent any quality in particular, or represent some person from Shakespeare's time that members of the audience would have recognized? 

from this website; the same however also points out that what was believed to be a reference to Steinbeck was in fact not, and a comment on the blogpost by Hammond and Scull, two of the foremost researchers of Tolkien and authors of (among other works) the massively definitive J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, said: 

Here, there's an interesting point to consider. Even after an explosion, you can come back after a little bit, and see growth, rebirth. After a fire, after natural disasters, you can also see rebirth. A scene I like to think of is in Disney's Fantasia - after the volcano erupts, it all comes back. With an atomic bomb, it doesn't work like that. If you look at the area of the Chernobyl disaster, lifeforms are still being born with mutations. There is a whole forest whose needles have turned red from the radiation. I think this all together points fairly clearly towards the poem referencing an atomic bomb. Another point - "Tree let your arms fall" is repeated in the poem. The symbolism there is that of giving up, giving in. There is nothing resistance can do. There is nothing the tree can do against the power of the atomic bomb. It can resist a fire with thick bark. It can resist a storm with its deep roots. It can resist, even, an explosion. But the sun is no ordinary one, and it must give in. Its end "is at last written". 

I'd like to point out the second verse is all about failures. "Your faith was strong but you needed proof" probably references Gideon, who had God perform miracles to prove that he was really the one God wanted. "You saw her bathing on the roof / Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya" references, of course, David and Bathsheba - David saw her, killed Bathsheba's husband, and took her as wife. "She tied you to a kitchen chair / She broke your throne and she cut your hair" probably all references the story of Samson and Delilah - Samson wanted Delilah even though he'd been warned not to be with her, and then she tricked him and cut his hair, removing his God given power. His actions eventually caused his death. A lot of the Old Testament is about God choosing a hero or rescuer, and the hero, rescuer, Israel, or all of the above, failing, and God forgives again. Just look, for example, at the book of Judges (though really almost any Old Testament book would do). 

That is the most relevant passage involving a tree, but a tree appears in many of his poems. A tree, in his mind, if you look at that last stanza, gives relief, it soothes. An atomic bomb is almost the exact antithesis of that. It is utter destruction. In this context, when the tree, relief, is told to give up - give in - to the atomic bomb, that says a lot about what he thought. 

No, there wasn't; Sam had no wish to go to sea. Sam is referencing what his father said earlier in the book (pgs 8 and 9 in my copy): 

Which also seems to cast doubt on Tolkien having known of Mark Twain. Then, I found this little gem, a transcript of a letter by J.R.R. Tolkien to Naomi Mitchel which seems to clearly indicate that Tolkien was indeed aware of at least some of the works of Mark Twain - the letter contrasts Michel's book, The Chapel Perilous, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: 

Censorship, I would argue, is more about the banning of discussion of specific topics. This isn't censorship. This is a complete end to real learning and thought. It's about staring, blank-eyed, at a screen - Montag's wife is almost not there by the end of the book, with the installation of the screens so she can "watch the story", though the stories are really meaningless. It's what the people want. So books go up in flames. 

Note also that I'm pretty sure this quote was not said by Descartes. This site provides several citations for when it was said. The earliest source for which there is any support is the Talmud: 

(From a letter to Arthur Greeves in October 1931 by C.S. Lewis.) Tolkien argued that myth was more than just a story. It is much as when he argued in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that "We do not deny the worth of the hero by accepting Grendel and the dragon." Just because the story of Nnedi has talking baboons doesn't mean it doesn't have worth. Interestingly, I looked up Nnedi Okorofar. She has severe scoliosis, and had to have her vertebrae fused together - according to Wikipedia: 

Looking at the word origin of Bilbo, it seems to come from bilboa and bilbao, both of which are purely English in origin. Tolkien, as a professor of English, would probably been aware of these words, and might have been influenced by it, especially as Bilbo owns the sword Sting, of Elvish make (therefore a good blade). However, there is another twist to this (thanks to the comments for pointing this out) - the "that class" here refers to hobbits of the class of Samwise and his Gaffer; Bilbo as a Baggins would not be of this class but a higher one, and thus this line crumbles a bit. I will note that also in Letter 25 it says: 

See this site. With Joan of Arc? It should be noted that Joan of Arc was not one of Twain's more...popular works. To quote Wikipedia on the matter, 

As asking if the life, and the memories left from it, have had an impact on people and have lead to a new growth yet. So we now arrive at your passage: 

Well, first, the whole beginning of your quote is basically saying: Cody was rich, but as he was getting older and presumably had a soft spot for women or wasn't super clever, many women tried to marry him for his money. Ramifications means consequences. Madame de Maintenon is actually a historical figure. She was the second wife of King Louis XIV of France, but her marriage wasn't actually official; she was of a different social rank than the King, so she was never officially queen. However, she had a lot of influence at court. She is often depicted in works as ambitious, greedy, and evil. Now, let's try to tackle the question. 

The question then, of course, is what exactly these "Obvious Sources" are. (The phrase "proper to their kind" is also intriguing as many have compared hobbits to the British servicemen in war who Tolkien so admired - see for example the work of Joseph Loconte.) In Letter 72, Tolkien writes: 

And so on and so forth. Further, names also fit in with culture and language - think Ghan-buri-ghan vs. Elrond vs. Nazgul vs. Khazad-dum. Literary form The form of Lord of the Rings is that of an epic. It's meant to emulate stories like Beowulf, or the Norse sagas, or the Finnish Kalevala, or the Oedipus cycle. Further, it is presented as such: in the foreword, Tolkien describes translating and transcribing the story he is about to tell from the Red Book of Westmarch. Storytelling A not insignificant portion of the Lord of the Rings is tales from the past, or reminiscing of the way things were. Think of the story told in the council of Elrond of how the ring came to be, and how it was passed to Frodo, or the story of Luthien and Beren told in the hollow of Weathertop, or the song sung by Gimli in Moria, or the song sung by Legolas just inside of Lothlorien, or the stories told by the Ents of the Entwives, or the reference of the barrow-wights to the past kings that lay there, or... The list clearly goes on. Further, there's some meta references - in the foreword, Tolkien mentions how he got the story, through the Red Book of Westmarch, which was copied and past down, and in LotR it's described how the Red Book was written, first by Bilbo, then Frodo, and finally Sam. There's also the appendices. Status as artefacts First, see above about the Red Book of Westmarch and the appendices. Second, things like the image provided, showing the inscription on Balin's tomb in the Chamber of Mazurbal act as "artefacts". He also describes hobbits in the foreword, and the family trees, almost as a historian or an archaeologist might. See also the section on the literary form of the work, and how LotR comes across as a true epic. Other Notes It seems that the definition of metafiction can be awfully confusing. Some definitions define metafiction as drawing attention the fictionality of the work - breaking the fourth wall, so to speak. Others define it as presenting the fiction as artefacts. Let me quote a paper on The Lord of the Rings' status as metafiction: 

As Peter Shor kindly pointed out, the line is actually from Au Lecteur, another poem. The last section of the poem translates as 

David is literally in awe and astonishment that God pays any attention to man, forgives man, has given man ownership of anything (later in the Psalm David says "You [...] crowned [man] with glory and honor"). No wonder David is "the baffled king" in Cohen's verse. Later in the same Psalm, David says "O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!" (Psalm 8:9) - he is literally a "baffled king composing hallelujah" - he goes right from being baffled to praising God. This is exactly Cohen's line. 

In the third and fourth lines here, the author is mourning ("if [only] my love were in my arms") and so in the first line the author is sort of pleading for their luck to change - when will the Western wind blow and return fortune so that their love comes back. Interestingly, the fact that your poem mentions "my love" is interesting, because Zephyr was also related to love. As mentioned above, he served Cupid, and this was because Zephyr loved Hyacinth, and so did Apollo, but Hyacinth chose Apollo, so in a fit of jealousy when Zephyr saw the two together playing with a discus, Zephyr caused the wind to blow at the discus, which ended up hitting Hyacinth in the head and killing him (stories vary, but some believe Zephyr intended the discus to hit Apollo in the head, not Hyacinth). Apollo was furious but Cupid took him under his protection because the act was out of love. The Western Wind here may thus also connect to the third line because of Zephyr's longing for Hyacinth, just as the author of the poem longs for their love. 

This strikes me more as referencing Tolkien's attitude towards myths and Christianity in particular: 

I'm reading J.R.R. Tolkien's The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún and the commentary talks a little bit about differences between Old Norse and Old English epic poetry: 

A final small note: Tolkien didn't exactly like Shakespeare; he wrote the story of the Ents marching on Orthanc because he did not like the way the marching of the forest was portrayed in Macbeth; he also did not like Shakespeare's writing of Elves. Hopefully this helps. 

The world we describe in our minds affects how we see things. We see everything through a lens - our biases, perceptions, thoughts, all affect how we act and see the world. That's exactly what this quote is describing. Everyone (or at least most people) know that they are biased, in some way or another. That bias affects how we see things. It's why we should be thoughtful when looking at anything. How much of what you're thinking is colored by your perceptions? Are you really thinking about this with an open mind? That's what this quote is talking about. 

(pg 5, Keith Baines version, bolding my own) Then after the church service, all the nobles file out to the courtyard and see the sword/stone with the inscription. However, nowhere that I can find in Malory does he come right out and say that Merlin enchanted the stone so only Arthur/the true king could pull it out. Do we know Merlin did this for sure? 

First, I'd like to point out that Dog is capitalized, which makes me think this isn't just an ordinary dog, but a represenation of something/someone else. Looking at my earlier interpretation of this growth from the dead as the impact of the memories, my first thought for what the Dog could be representing is a critic. The critic appears to be a friend to men - many read what they say and consider it - but in reality, they can be enemies, which explains the connection with Webster's The White Devil. Further, the next line is 

So it could very well be that Tolkien was not in fact familiar with this particular tale of Twain but was familiar with the source material from which Twain drew. On the other hand, these sources are primarily in French, and to quote letter 213: 

In my answer here I interpret the meaning of the broken images in this passage as referencing the memories someone has. With this interpretation, I read 

In the passage The first paragraph here proposes (through a somewhat rhetorical line of questioning) that novels are meant to help provide a moral model for society: 

It conveys the idea, more subtly than explicitly stating it. If the author is asked about that idea, they can say that it was merely to explore, merely to write a story for people to enjoy, by no means to propound an idea. By nature, it is a way for a writer to explore an idea, but with less impact on themselves. Le Guin also said in the quote you provide 

All quotes from the Bible in this answer are from the NIV Study Bible from 1995, edited primarily by Kenneth Barker, though with help from Burdick, Stek, Wessel, and Youngblood. 

In Sophie's World, as the end of the book approaches, crazier and crazier things begin to happen - dramatic storms, fairy tale characters in the forest, geese that carry people around, strange garden parties, and so forth. The purpose seems to be that it shows the power the author (well, not really the author, the in-book author, the major) has over the world. But why is this shown through such fantastic events? I can understand inserting some irony ("breaking the fourth wall" so to speak) and lots of birthday references, but the fairy tale characters for the most part seem kind of random, and the whole party is just weird (though Alberto does suspect the crashing of the white Mercedes distracted the major so they could escape). What was the purpose in making the ending so fantastic and wildly different from the rest of the book? 

Cohen may have pictured David similarly "banging his head" and then coming up with the "secret chord [that] pleased the Lord" and being a bit baffled on what happened inbetween.
