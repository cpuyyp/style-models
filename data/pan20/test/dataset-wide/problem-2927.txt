Is post-modernism really pragmatic? Seattle is widely promoted as a "progressive" city, yet it's actually just the opposite. I haven't studied postmodernism in any detail yet, but I've spotted a few red flags. 

Things are going to Hell because philosophy has made insufficient progress, or it isn't making progress fast enough. The problem is that there's too much disagreement between philosophers or philosophical disciplines, which only creates confusion. Things are going downhill simply because too few people are knowledgeable about philosophy; in other words, the lessons of philosophy are largely ignored. Philosophy really isn't part of the equation. Philosophy's essential goal is to interpret or explain the world. Using that knowledge to effect change is the province of something else (e.g. political activism). 

The revelation that Earth is round had a huge impact on Christianity, similar to Darwin's theory of evolution. The ability of medical science to keep even the terminally ill alive and perform a variety of abortions has similarly affected Christianity and stimulated philosophical thought. One of the key questions is "What is life?" or "When does life begin?" Those are questions that could have been asked in the distant past, but they've taken on a new meaning. Suggestions that Earth itself might be considered something akin to a living organism (Gaia) has generated some philosophical discussion. Humankind's growing impact on the environment, including genetically modified food, raises some urgent ethical questions. However, it isn't clear (to me) if they have really revolutionized philosophic thought. 

Analysis - He's correct. Moreover, if we find out John Doe didn't vote, we really shouldn't criticize him for not voting if the election was a total sham. 

Whenever media headlines announce a major unexpected snowfall, many people exclaim, "Aha, global warming is a hoax!" Their logic is simple: Snow requires cold weather, therefore, record snowfall must indicate record cold, not warming. But the apparent logic is deceptive. Snowfall is also determined by other variables, including precipitation. In fact, global warming models predict more erratic weather, with increased drought in many locations along with increased precipitation (including snowfall) in others. Is there a philosophical term for the deceptive logic or "pseudo-logic" described in the first paragraph? Can we call it logic to begin with? 

I can only partially answer your question. The principle of "innocent until proven guilty" is generally just. Wrongfully convicting people just doesn't make much sense. But in times of war, that gets turned upside down. Now, guards scream "Halt, who goes there?!" Obviously, they have to assume an intruder is the enemy. We might thus argue that presumptions of innocence and guilt are dictated somewhat by the environment. If you're surrounded by friends in peacetime, you have the luxury of letting your guard down. But in time of war or natural disasters, you may have to assume the opposite. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that people should be punished without a trial; you may simply keep a close on them or take a few extra precautions. You can also add a little math to the equation. Many Jews believe there's no such a thing as a good Nazi; every nazi that ever existed was evil. In other words, they wouldn't give a Nazi a trial. Rather, they would simply assume he or she was evil, just because so many other Nazis were supposedly evil. That's pretty much the way I've come to feel about U.S. politicians and media you-know-what. I consider them guilty (i.e. corrupt) unless they can prove otherwise. Why? Because in two decades of activism, I've encountered virtually no one that was on the level. I'm not intimately familiar with the Obama policy you mention, so I don't know how relevant my response is. But if you have a situation where women are in extreme danger of sexual assault, then you might have no choice but swing the pendulum away from justice for the accused towards protection for the victims. 

I'm confused by your comments on crime and punishment. You believe in punishment - not because we want to punish the individual but because we want to impact "the mental state of all society." But then you state that when a person thinks about doing something bad, they'll worry about the punishment they're going to receive. So you go from the individual to "all society," then back to the individual. Or are you suggesting that the individual's second thoughts before committing a crime result from a society-wide perception of punishment? Also, it isn't clear to me how your suggestion is radically different from the status quo. I'm no fan of the justice system in the U.S., which is horribly corrupt and embraces an enormous double standard. But I think it's based largely on the premise that punishment is a deterrent to crime. You're obviously in favor of punishment, but I guess you just support it with a supposedly different philosophy. I may be going off on a tangent, but I think punishment is important not just as a deterrent but to give society a sense of justice. If a psychopath murders a dozen people and isn't punished, then a lot of friends and loved ones are going to be in even greater pain. 

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand how, in a universe without free will, an individual couldn't write the sentence in your example. Which isn't to say I'm part of the mainstream. I would certainly prefer to believe that free will exists. My personal feeling is that the question is simply too complex to know if a reliable answer to the puzzle has been found; the jury's still out for me. Unfortunately, your example doesn't work for me, though, like I said, I could be missing something. Kudos for the effort. 

NO. The opposite of emancipate is enslave, and that'a a much better description of what's happening - not in the future, but now. There are some who might consider themselves emancipated - the techies, propagandists, etc. But, in the U.S., the middle class may be going the way of the dodo. Of course, the people who are pushing automation - notably corporate tycoons - keep getting richer and richer, giving them more power over the government and therefore over ordinary citizens. That's hardly an example of "emancipation." It's just the opposite. Keep in mind, also, that the global population continues to grow, meaning the number of people requiring either a job or a free handout from some utopian post-capitalist government that's remarkably fair and caring (will Congress still be a club made up of white, male millionaires?) will only increase. One should also remember automation's handmaiden, artificial intelligence. The reality that is unfolding around us is very bleak, which is precisely why propagandists are spinning wonderful tales about a "post-capitalist" paradise guided by its own philosophical school that most emancipated citizens can't even understand, postmodernism. A more precise answer: Automation has already emancipated many people from labor, but it has emancipated an even greater number from jobs. 

As a U.S. citizen, I live on stolen land, built by stolen labour, powered by stolen resources from poor countries - but not necessarily by choice. I just happened to be born in a land characterized by those problems. I can do what I can to fight those problems, but my chances of beating the system aren't great. However, I can choose not to loot. The comparison is therefore invalid. Whether the person who posted this was comparing apples and oranges depends on the context. Judging by the excerpt you posted, it sounds kind of lame. However, they may have posted it to point out a particular injustice or hypocrisy. It's reminiscent of the photos of Native Americans accompanied by captions that read something like "And you think MEXICANS are illegal aliens?" The photo and caption point out a major hypocrisy, but it may not make much sense unless you associate it with the proper people, in the right context. Accumulation was probably correct in identifying it as a tu quoque fallacy. However, we aren't necessarily talking about a situation involving two wrongs. There are multiple wrongs, but I never owned slaves or fought Native Americans, and I have long spoken out against U.S. imperialism, so I don't feel like anyone is pointing a finger at me. 

Humans are animals and are born neither good nor evil. "Good" behavior is generally taught or imitated. It begins with learning to follow one's parents' rules (e.g. don't hit), then society's rules. Eventually, one must learn to follow the state's rules. Empathy allows us to effectively extend goodness, caring for people on the other side of the world or even other species (generally "sentient" species). "Bad" behavior consists of either breaking the rules or knowingly doing something that hurts another individual or even another species (e.g. kicking a dog). 

I just listened to a video in which a propagandist compares conspiracy theory to animism - the belief that natural forces are imbued with "agency," which he describes as "some sort of life force." He says that conspiracy theorists similarly think social issues are imbued with agency. We might describe this as simple obfuscation. He's using a somewhat unfamiliar word ("agency"), and it isn't clear if he's saying conspiracy theorists think social issues are actually living things - like robots revolting against their makers - or if he's subliminally suggesting that social issues aren't even remotely connected to living things (e.g. the humans who create social issues). In other words, wars aren't caused by humans; they just happen the way flowers blossom and birds lay eggs. What kind of fallacy (or fallacies) would this qualify as? Or is this just one big spew of gibberish (obfuscation), designed to confuse and disorient people? You Are Not So Smart Podcast 016 @ ~ 9:35 

People certainly need to embrace both philosophy and psychology, though I'm not certain if Freudian ideas are necessarily the key. I've been reading about humanistic psychology, which strikes me as kind of a mixed bag. But I think it may help balance Sigmund Freud's neurosis-based psychology. 

The goal of the game is to focus on topics (e.g. evolution/paleontology > Neanderthals) and try to put together a combination of deductive and inductive clues that form a "framework." For example, we know that Neanderthals were bipedal humans ("archaic humans") that presumably evolved in Europe (300,000 years ago, I think) and apparently became extinct (about 30,000 years ago?). We also know Neanderthals were extremely similar to modern humans. So the goal is to put together a combination of deductive/inductive clues that help us distinguish between human fossils and Neanderthal fossils, based on what we know about their morphology, the dates both groups first appeared in Europe (and when they became extinct), etc. Stress the fact that good detectives need to do their homework in order to really use deductive/inductive reasoning effectively. If you're interested in political science, then study political science, history, psychology and philosophy in order to grasp the basics. Then you can create more effective lines of deductive/inductive reasoning. In fact, that might be an idea for another game: 1) Choose a topic (e.g. a conspiracy theory). 2) Each player then has to create a series of deductive/inductive clues that shed light on the theory. 3) The winner is the player who either proves or disproves the theory or who can at least pronounce the theory credible or not highly credible with the least number of deductive/inductive clues. Sorry for the wordy response, but, to summarize, make the difference between deduction and induction clear, then practice by applying each one to a variety of topics before creating "frameworks" based on series of deductive reasoning and inductive clues. Make it more fun by turning it into a game. EDIT: I edited this to change "Sorry of the worse response" to "Sorry for the worthy response." ;) 

Do most notable philosophers accept such lies as virtuous or at least acceptable, or do they condemn ALL lies? If you know of any philosophers or philosophical schools that have really explored this topic, it would help if you could mention them. 

I decided to analyze my personal philosophy regarding good and evil. Can anyone tell me how it compares with what major philosophers or doctrines have to say about good and evil? 

Sure, it's possible, but there are limitations. Levitating people sounds a little far-fetched, for example. There were a couple philosophers named Hobbes and Rousseau who had very different ideas about Nature and "progress." Hobbes thought man's natural state was brutish, while Rousseau was more of a romanticist who thought progress degraded people. I believe another philosopher named Locke was somewhere in the middle. My natural inclination is to side with Rousseau. Unfortunately, I couldn't survive without electricity and ice cream. In the end, it's a balancing act. There's no question that technology has affected us in both positive and negative ways. But some would argue "What's so bad about a physically disabled person (who would have been eaten by predators thousands of years ago) who's a guru of astro-physics?" 

War can be regarded as an extension of the agonistic behavior that's wired into our genes. Our ancestors were fighting long before recorded history. A major reason for fighting, not just in humans but in many species, is competition for resources. If two lions wrestle each other until one surrenders, then you still have two lions preying on the same herd of zebras. But if one lion kills the other lion, it then has the zebras all to itself. Of course, ritualized fighting is a common thing among many species, including humans. But lethal fights are also very common. Modern wars are generally driven by greed. People fight wars because they want another country's natural resources or gold reserves, or because they think another county is competing with their economy. So why strive for some sort of civil agreement when you can just kill the other country's inhabitants, giving you a stronger bargaining position? The U.S. government (and probably many others) has a long tradition of going to war with countries that have different values or belief systems (e.g. socialism). People who have been exploited by capitalism for generations may not be interested in arm wrestling. The only way to force some countries to accept free market capitalism is to bomb them into the ground, then literally force them to do your bidding. At the same time, bombing their factories eliminates competition, making your country stronger. (World War II was one of the best things that ever happened to the U.S.) Of course, the very act of war has become an enormous business, with trillions of dollars spent on weapons systems and material. If we settled a conflict by letting Donald Trump arm wrestle the leader of the Afghan freedom fighters, then a lot of greedy, powerful people invested in the military-industrial complex would lose a lot of money. I'm not saying I support this mentality, by the way. The irony is that the more money the U.S. government steals from other countries, the more impoverished U.S. citizens themselves become - not to mention human rights issues and environmental destruction. 

Your question inspires another question: What kind of fallacy is it where an oppressed individual who breaks the rules is automatically condemned as unethical, with virtually no scrutiny of the people who make and enforce the rules? There is an assumption that the people who make the rules (the oppressors) are ethical and live up to the rules. In fact, that very frequently isn't the case at all. In "Corporate America," for example, the rules are typically drawn up by corporate attorneys and politicians. The people whose lives are governed by the rules typically have little or no real representation. On top of that, the government, corporations, etc. often break their own rules. To put it in perspective, consider a card game. If a person you're playing with is cheating (breaking the rules), then it doesn't make much sense to continue playing, especially if you're playing for money. So a smart person would just walk away. But in "the real world," people can't just walk away. We have to work in order to acquire the money we need to survive. We have to follow local and national laws. We have to follow company rules. But if the people who make and enforce those rules aren't playing fair, ordinary people may have little choice but break the rules themselves. The stakes are even higher if an oppressed individual has a family to care for. Do you follow unfair rules if doing so means your children will go hungry or receive a poor education? Looking at it another way, instead of asking if it's ethical for an oppressed individual to break the rules, let's ask if it's ethical for a politician or corporate tycoon (insert the name of your favorite capitalist titan here) to break the rules? EDIT I should add that there is a big gray area here, too. If the oppressor isn't playing by the rules, does that make it OK for the oppressed to break ALL the rules? Taken to an extreme, that mentality could lead to anarchy. So the oppressed are forced to walk a tightrope, attempting to figure out which rules can or should be broken, when, by whom, etc. 

The two questions posed in the title of your post would be equally at home in a psychology forum. In fact, psychology is a great thing for a philosophy student to study on the side. The answer to your first question is YES. What you think is a rational thought could be based on propaganda you have unwittingly stored in your mind, a misunderstanding of scientific principals, a cognitive bias, etc. The partial answer to your second question begins with understanding and accepting your limitations. If you believe something (A), ask other people what they believe about A. If their beliefs are different than yours, try to pick apart their arguments to see if they hold water. Warning: "Peer review" can itself be deceptive. Many so-called peer-reviewed journals are nothing more than propaganda rags. So it helps to solicit opinions from several people and make sure you analyze their opinions to make sure they're logical. You can sometimes rely on your senses and powers of observation. If you think the economy isn't so bad because the media says it's not so bad, and "Hey, it's gonna get much better!," then just look at your paycheck and benefits, as well as your overall standard of living. If you're surrounded by a growing population of homeless people, you might start questioning the media. Unfortunately, many philosophical questions are beyond the scope of science, the senses, etc. Just for fun, you should post your question on a psychology forum and see what kind of answers you get. If you do, please share the link; I'm curious to see the responses.
