I think that, in addition to Greg's answer, it is also fair to end the interview when you know that you're not going to hire the person for whatever reason. There's no sense in wasting either participant's time going through a charade of an interview until you hit some magic time threshold. It's definitely a little harsh and, as an interviewer, I hate to do it. But I make sure the recruiters I work with convey to the candidates that there is a possibility of the interview lasting as little as 10 minutes. And yes, I have interviewed candidates that lasted as little as 10 minutes. At which point I say "Look, I'm sorry, this just isn't going to happen. Best of luck." 

I would make sure you recognize that different people will interpret this request differently. You're likely to get a range of interpretation from earnest naivete all the way to blatant sycophancy. Like mhoran alludes to, I would start with the folks that you have more regular interactions with and save the more senior people for another time. As long as you're sincere, most people would be more than willing to spend an hour over lunch discussing things with you. Just make sure that you have some specific questions and topics to cover. If the crux of your questions are "How can I be successful at Company X?" you're odds of getting something beyond "Work hard and get your stuff done on time" aren't going to be that high, unless you get really lucky with the person you select. Think about what you want to get out of the exchange before you even broach having the exchange. 

The communities in which we work throughout our lives are generally pretty small. You never know when you might come across some of the same folks you're working with now. And you can't predict if they'll be in a position to decide whether or not you get some job or some promotion. You don't say how much time you have left on your notice period, but if it's just a couple of weeks, I'd suck it up and power through. Make sure all of your work is done, any transition stuff is prepared, etc... Your manager is treating you differently because they're likely taking your departure personally. This happens all the time and I'd just ignore it, do your job and thinking about how great things are going to be in your new gig in a couple of weeks. 

If you're pretty confident that they are being shady, I would ignore them and use it as an opportunity to winnow down the list of recruiters with whom you may work in the future. Additionally, depending on your level of confidence, it may be worth reporting to either the employer or a higher up in the recruiting organization. But this doesn't sound egregious enough for that. 

I have had colleagues in the Netherlands who changed job while being in therapy for burn out or other serious health conditions. As far as I know, it's not something that will prevent you from getting a job, as long as you are open about it with your employer. You may ask your doctor advices on how to handle it with your employer (he/she will surely have other patients in the same condition). Maybe you can settle to start working part time (0.6 or 0.8 FTE) and then gradually increasing your work load as your health situation improves. 

you don't really have to fill in the time with "inane" topics just for the sake of using the entire hour. As additional benefit, you won't risk being perceived as a person who needs to be micromanaged. Based on my experience in most of the cases half an hour is more than enough for a weekly face to face. 

Normally not. Whenever I have searched for a high-tech job in the Netherlands I was almost never asked for reference letters. Normally you are required a CV/resume and a cover letter, sometimes a list of exam with grades, but reference letters is not really requested as common practice. 

It sounds at best a borderline comment, as it implies that as a woman you should be more "decorative", which per se is not appropriate, as I assume the job you are hired for is not purely based on appearance. You should probably check what is the company policy on sexual harassment, gender equality and if there is any speak up policy about such episodes. Then, if you feel molested by such comments, take action. I would suggest such order of escalation (but this is based on the policy and culture of the company where I work): 

First of all, check what is the company policy for applicants. Some companies do not allow multiple applications, for the sake of reducing load on HR (in big companies each HR can receive hundreds of CV in a day, do not expect them to do your job of matching CV and positions for you). If the company has no policy forbidding multiple applications, I would still advice you to narrow down your selection in any case. Multiple applications can convey the message your simply firing in the group or that you are indecisive, and you don't want to be labeled as the serial applicant. Set some criteria to evaluate the position, rank them and go for the top one. 

A company usually thinks of its employees like "progressing". Therefore wanting to stay in the same position is already kind of strange and sometimes not well perceived. Even more weird can be the will to step down, so the crucial point here is how you motivate the question which you will get: with your experience, why are you applying for a junior position? If you are able to tell a convincing story there would be no big issues. 

Will you modify my resume without my approval? Do I get final say on which opportunities I'm presented as a candidate for? How does your firm source new candidates and new opportunities? Do you present multiple candidates simultaneously for a position, or one at a time? Can I speak with the account manager for each opportunity that you may present me for? etc 

The chairs that you should be looking at have a crazy amount of options when it comes to adjustment. I have personal experience with Aerons and Steelcase chairs, generally considered the cream of the crop for office chairs, and both of them are outrageously adjustable and configurable. If you're looking at chairs in this price range, the personal preference for employees will probably just come down to the mesh vs non-mesh as everything else can likely be moved into appropriate positions. However, recognize that many people won't familiarize themselves with the chair that they're using and it may be beneficial to bring in an ergonomic expert to help educate people on how to appropriately adjust their chairs for long term comfort. 

Typically these pay levels are a range and are attached to the position being filled. So, a 'Junior Widget Flipper' could have a range of 10k to 20k while a 'Senior Widget Flipper' could have a range of 30k to 40k. Despite having these ranges established, this question gets asked for a few reasons: 

In my opinion, JMort has good advice if your issue with the actions is the physicality of the action. If, however, the issue is the inferred purpose of the action (i.e. to dominate), then I'm going to go against the grain of the other answers... I really think you should ask yourself why it really matters. If you know the action is to 'dominate,' then how does that really influence your day to day activities or impact your position in the workplace since you can account for it? One option is to "rise above" the games being played... Let the sales guys or whomever play their silly little personal interaction games. Recognize that, in the long run, it has no real impact on your life or work and give the guy the benefit of the doubt that he's just being friendly. Knowing, of course, that when it comes down to actual position and merit in the workplace, you've got him beat on the things that really matter. 

It is difficult, in my mind, to explicitly quantify "Motivation." It's probably the easiest of the desirable "soft skills" to BS in a technical interview. Rather than motivation, I look for passion. A passionate person can be a motivated person, you just have to be able to get them passionate about the right things. HLGEM is on the right track with her answer. One of my favorite interview questions is "Tell me about your most favorite project ever - Dev / Non-Dev, Professional/Personal." If the candidate answers passionately then you can infer that they can be motivated. Conversely, if they answer flatly, I expect to be disappointed. This question also provides a nice vector into conversationally gauging additional problem-solving skills and potentially technical skills as you dive into a deeper discussion about their most favorite project. 

Large company based in continental Europe. How to handle a project lead who refuses to use English in meetings, even though there are engineers in the meeting who are known to not speak the local language and have been hired with the only language requirement of "good knowledge of English, both oral and written"? Making explicit local language is not spoken and explicit requests to use English have been made and ignored. Addendum: Project Lead is able to properly speak English, and when asked why not using English answered that "using local language is more effective" (though somebody else has then to translate the content of the meeting) Edit: this is not a duplicate of colleagues not talking english, as the person having this behavior is in an higher hierarchical position. UPDATE Made aware of the issue, management has sent an e-mail to remind all employees that meetings shall be held in English. Reaction of the PL has been to move discussions from meetings to coffee machine stand up talks, still in local language. 

To optimize your effort, I suggest you take the no response as a lack of interest on your profile and move on. If you really want to show interest in the company/position, give a call before applying and ask some questions about the role. In this way when they see your CV they will already have you in their mind, and you will be "oh, this is that candidate who called me...". 

I don't think you have to fill the entire hour. Managers are normally very busy, and usually glad to cut some meeting short if possible. Therefore, once you have 

If your mind is really made up for leaving, there is no reason in playing with the fire and risking your perspective employer to doubt your commitment. If, as you say, it's the company tune that motivates you to leave, it is not an higher salary that will accommodate that. You are wasting time (yours, your current manager's, your future manager's) just to fiddle. If this comes to surface it won't praise your attitude. 

Stop covering the sh*t he makes. Let managers step on it and let him bear the consequences of his work. If you remove his accountability by filling the (alleged) gaps he creates, there is no way that the organization will feel the need to fix the issue. 

The ethics would require that you get paid for what you have done. If you are faster than the average, increase your hourly rate so that the end payment is comparable. But do this before accepting a task. Doing it afterwards will only put you under a bad light. 

Made up example: "In my present project I am working of the validation of an algorithm for biomedical usage. Without going into confidential details, it analyzes data gathered via an echo scan and assesses the health of the patient's liver. What I do is testing the algorithm by feeding it data and checking the outcome versus the analysis executed with the present golden standard. By doing this and providing feedback to the developers team, I have been able to increase the analysis rate from 8 patients/day to 40 patients/day". You don't explain how the algorithm work, but you explain your work.
