Whenever I interview at a company, I like to talk to my potential peers. I always ask questions about the company and about my potential boss. But I try hard not to have my questions come across as negative. Some of your questions are okay, but you don't want these peers reporting back that you seem very negative. 

The top-notch companies I know hire people who are smart and hardworking. Since you have no formal work experience other than your work with these startups, I would certainly list them as evidence of how smart and hardworking you are. Good companies (and all the top-notch companies I know of) understand that good potential employees tend to be busy people, doing a lot of things at the same time. Be ready to talk about this work, what you mean by "being a stakeholder" and what you expect to continue to do for them (if anything). Many employers aren't phased by good people having "side gigs" although a few are. 

Unless there is something specifically in the employee manual prohibiting it, you could permit your team members to do as they have done in the past, until you/they are told to change. In this case, that's the approach I would take. Don't ask, don't tell. And that's exactly what I have done in the past when my company was acquired. I assumed the old rules still applied unless I was specifically told that they did not. Where I worked most recently, the office park had a daycare center adjacent to the parking lot. Most of the businesses arranged a discounted fee for just these types of cases. Seemed to be a handy arrangement. 

That seems unlikely. Still, if your friend gets hired and turns out to be an excellent employee he/she could turn around and recommend you at some point in the future. And the hiring manager might remember that you recommended what turn out to be a great hire. 

Whenever you take over a new project, you owe it to the company to assess the situation anew. You need to look at the tasks at hand, the schedule, the expectations, your abilities, the people you have working with you, and the options available. You may conclude that you need more help, more time, a change in expectations, or perhaps all three. Or you may conclude that you aren't good enough professionally to lead this project. Tell your manager up front what you see. You ask for what you think you need. Then you find a way to deal with what you are actually given, as best you can. 

In my experience it is very common for US employers to pay employees commensurate with wages that are market-driven within their locale. That is the reasoning behind a lot of outsourcing decisions - go where the labor is cheaper. 

You were asked to review it. So review it. First, go to the author and ask how you should convey the results of your review. That might include a pencil markup of the document, and in-line markup of the doc file, or something else. Then review everything. Mark up spelling and grammar errors as well as technical problems and omissions. Do the job you are being asked to do. No need to be shy about it - just comment on the document not the author. If you do this respectfully, most likely you'll just get a big "Thank You". Not everyone is good at writing, but nobody wants to look foolish to the clients. I've been there and done this many times. 

Just send a simple "Thanks!" email to the director, without replying to everyone. That shows your gratitude without going over the top. 

You seem to think that an open, friendly, low-stress culture implies low productivity and lack of professionalism. This is not the case. As a manager, you owe it to your company and to your team to set clear expectations, and hold your team accountable for meeting those expectations. You are probably already doing that, but aren't even aware of it. If you expect chaos, you'll get chaos. If you don't expect folks to act professionally, they won't. You (and the rest of management) set the tone for others to follow. You should get together with the rest of management and discuss the issue first. Unless they are in agreement that change is needed, you won't succeed. But if they are, then you'll have a chance. I'd have a team meeting and talk about the fact that productivity needs to improve. I'd mention that I didn't want to lose the fun parts of the culture, but that without productivity we won't have a viable company. I'd make sure that everyone understood that change is necessary, not optional. And I'd hint that if folks don't want to go along with the changes, then they may be better off working somewhere else. Then I would start setting meaningful goals, and measuring the achievement against those goals. Change is hard and it will take some time. Not everyone will understand and adapt quickly. But you do need to see understanding and progress. As painful as it may be, it might be necessary to eventually fire folks who refuse to go along with the new program. Hopefully it won't be needed, and hopefully everyone will get on board as quickly as they can. If you are in management, it's your job to manage and to lead. You and the rest of management are responsible for where you are now. You need to be responsible for change. 

That's a false dilemma. Nobody would ever advise anyone to get insufficient sleep, just as nobody would advise going without food or water in order to prepare for an interview. Get enough sleep - every day, not just when you are preparing for a test or interview. Use your free time in your waking hours to prepare for your interview. In general, you want to understand and be conversant in the technical aspects of the new job, understand the company, and be very conversant on your background - with a particular emphasis on whatever is contained in your resume and cover letter and with anything in your background that is particularly relevant to the new job. 

I don't believe in the US there is a federal law requiring that they warn you ahead of time that the "background check" will include a drug test. And each state has their own laws. See: $URL$ That said, every time I have encountered a situation where a drug test was to be performed, I was actually notified ahead of time. If this is a situation that could be dicey for you, you should prepare as if you will be drug tested - whether it is mentioned ahead of time or not. 

(note: In my answer, I'm assuming that these individuals have already handed in their notice, and that you are seeing changed behavior afterward.) I don't think it's a matter of leniency, just a matter of "what are you going to do - fire them?" If your company has a written policy around sick time (such as requiring doctor's notes) or remote work, then certainly follow whatever the policy dictates. And hopefully, when you received the resignation, you talked with the individuals one-on-one and spoke about leaving on a professional note. Other than that, the only real possibility is to hint that you would withhold a good recommendation in the future. ("I'd like to be able to give you a great recommendation down the road, and write about how professionally you handled your last weeks with us.") If you are still uncomfortable with this, talk to HR. This certainly isn't the first time this has happened in your company. HR could give you some additional (and possibly company-specific) guidance. They could also step in and talk with the offending individual(s). 

Just send an informal email, requesting permission. Make it non-confrontational and fact-based. Make it clear what you want your manager to do. Acknowledge that this is contrary to the CEO's email, but state your reasons for why you think your request is appropriate. Just be cognizant of the fact that, in spite of what the employee manual says your manager could do, your manager is in a difficult position. You may get what you are wishing for, but you may not. (BTW, most dress codes are silly, subjective, and outmoded. Yet such is the life of many/most businesses.) 

Well certainly it can be viewed as "disloyal". And it could "backfire" in the sense that one or both parties won't want to play the bidding game. If you still decide you want to risk it and play the game, your best bet is to go to your current employer and indicate that you have a solid offer to go to your former company for a 25% increase. You could indicate how grateful you are, that you really like your current company, and that you really like your current manager (if that's the truth). You could point out how stellar your performance has been, and how valuable you are to the company. You could also indicate that you understand you are being paid competitively, and that at one time, this kind of increase wouldn't have mattered too much, but now it does. You then ask if they would be willing to match or beat your other offer. That way, if they match or beat the other offer, you can still take two different paths: 

First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss. While career is important, family is far more important. Looking at your situation from a prospective employer's view, it's not hard to see how they could be wary. Your employment history is 1 year, 6 months, 8 months, and 1 year (with the local agency). Unfortunately, you have no history of staying at a job for any significant period of time. The bad news is that it might take some time to overcome this history. The good news is that it only takes one good job (where you stay for a long time) to do so. I don't seen any value in bringing up "personal issues" in a cover letter. I don't think that would reassure any prospective employers, and it might bring up concerns about what the "personal issue" was, and if it still lingers. I think your best course would be to indicate in your cover letter that you are seeking a company where you can build a long-term career. That signals to employers that your short-term stays are over. During interviews, you will almost certainly be asked why you left jobs so early. This will be your opportunity to explain. Make sure you think your responses through. You don't want to come across as flighty, and you do want to project an attitude of "those were unfortunate and I really want this time to be different". Even though you are ready to resume your career, make sure you are careful selecting your next job. You don't want to rush into something that will not last - that would just confirm the prior pattern. 

It probably wouldn't matter, but I would be worried that some folks would view you as "the sensitive type", and concerned about people mispronouncing your name. Yet you have indicated that this mispronunciation doesn't bother you. 

Only you and your former boss can know what his blurted out comment really meant. That said, you were right to brush it aside. You will be best served by keeping work about work, and nothing else. So assume positive intent here. Assume that the comment was just an awkward way to deliver a work-based compliment. Hopefully that never happens again. If it does, you'll need to deal with it at that time. 

Yes, you should continue to socialize with your co-workers as you repair your performance and your professional reputation. (As @JanDoggen points out, "No amount of socializing will make up for bad performance". But I'm assuming that wasn't your intent here.) Particularly if you are making an honest effort to get better, most folks are able to separate their social interactions with you from your work issues - even more so if your supervisor is becoming happy with your improved performance. Every team has a "best" performer and a "worst" performer. Being at the bottom end doesn't mean you have to be a social outcast. Socially, it's attitude that matters far more.
