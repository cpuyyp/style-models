The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche rather prominently includes the idea of the Übermensch ("overman" or "superman"), who were exempt from the ordinary rules of morality in some sense. Is this what the following passage from The Magician's Nephew is referring to? Does Uncle Andrew consider himself an Übermensch? 

When the Strikers re-emerged, there would've been numerous abandoned factories and equipment (including, presumably, factories and equipment that had been abandoned by the Strikers themselves). While the original owners may have been around in some cases, in many other cases there wouldn't be any clear ownership of these factories (e.g. if the owners were dead). If some of them were in at least somewhat salvageable condition, would the Strikers be able to rightfully use them? While the book doesn't directly answer this, how would someone gain the rights to the property in the first place? Economist and political philosopher Murray Rothbard (who was not associated with Ayn Rand), for example, argued that property rights (e.g. to the rights to land ownership in a previously-undiscovered area) "originally" derived from being able to make productive use of it. Does Ayn Rand have some kind of view of how property rights could "originate" in the first place? Is it similar to Rothbard's or different? The most direct hint to this in the book is when Dagny and Hank visited the 20th Century Motor Factory, seeing if anything was salvageable from it. (They discover the prototype of John Galt's motor along with a partial manual related to it, which they promptly take with them; Dagny promptly goes through considerable trouble to try to find the original inventor and, when she failed to find John Galt, hired Quintin Daniels to try to reverse engineer it). You could argue that this was meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive (i.e. the fact that the book records that Dagny and Hank did that doesn't necessarily mean that Ayn Rand thought that they were doing the right thing), but is this an implicit endorsement of a view that's analogous to Murray Rothbard's? Was the fact that they were able to at least try to put it to productive use and the fact that there was no longer any clear ownership in the company a basis for them to claim at least some kind of a property right over it? 

We're not told exactly how much time passed, but I agree with you - it doesn't seem like a lot of time in the book. The book glosses over the details of what happened in the interim. John Galt is also admittedly somewhat vague as to why he thought that it was time to go back: 

This only appears to describe a single "surface" (evidently a snow-covered landscape). That being the case, why is this titled "On Most Surfaces"? What's the significance of the title? 

Maybe. First, it's important to realize that her attitude towards Narnia is only one of several reasons that Susan wasn't there. For example, unlike the other characters, Susan isn't dead yet. Everyone who was in Aslan's country in The Last Battle was either there because they were in Narnia at the end of the world (e.g. Eustice, Jill, and the others at the Last Battle) or because they had recently died (Peter, Edmund, Polly, and others had recently died in a train accident; Susan doesn't appear to have been with them at the time). That being said, even if Susan had remained a friend of Narnia, there's absolutely no reason that she'd be in Aslan's Country at that point. The only people actually recorded to have gone to Aslan's Country while still alive are those alive at the end of the world in Narnia and Reepicheep the mouse (in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader). At a minimum, then, Susan has the opportunity to change. We can only speculate as to whether she actually did or not (although, as others have said, the text strongly implies that her current behavior was a "phase" she was going through), but I think that there was a good chance that she did. Another point to consider: being "too grown-up" (at least in the sense of chronological age) doesn't seem to be an absolute exclusion. Several of the people there were already adults, or even quite old (e.g. Digory Kirke), so chronological age alone doesn't seem to be an absolute exclusion. This is especially true given that the Pevensies had already been told that they were too old to return to Narnia (Peter in Prince Caspian and Lucy and Edmond in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader). I think "grown up" in that sense refers more to a mental attitude (rather than just their age in years). Also, I think that this quote from the end of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is very important: 

Shortly before the Sphere visits him, A Square had a dream about Lineland. The king of Lineland was unconvinced by A Square's arguments in favor of a second dimension. A Square's efforts to convince the King included analogies, describing things that he wouldn't be able to see without being in a higher dimension, and moving in ways that would be impossible for someone of their world (e.g. seeming to disappear and to then reappear). The king of Lineland accuses him of being a magician and tries to kill him. He views the king of Lineland with disgust as a fool. When he's visited by the Sphere, though, he reacts to being told about the existence of a third dimension in almost exactly the same way that the king of Lineland had reacted to being told of a second dimension, even though the Sphere made the exact same kind of arguments that A Square himself had just used. Why didn't he recognize the obvious double standard here? 

Related: Why did Yossarian sign letters with "Washington Irving"? Both Major Major and Yossarian would routinely sign official documents and censorship documents with "Washington Irving" (I have another question on exactly why they do that). When that became too monotonous, they'd sign stuff with "Irving Washington" for awhile. Why didn't they simply select a completely different name? Why did they consider reversing the names less monotonous? Or is that part of the joke (the fact that it really wasn't all that different)? 

To what extent did Eddie learn why he felt that later, or why it bothered him so much? Why did he tell the bum that it didn't bother him when they both knew that it did? Who was Eddie trying to convince - the bum or himself? 

This would suggest that C. S. Lewis didn't know "in advance" how many Narnia books he would write. This would seem to at least open the possibility that he would have written more Narnia books at some point. Even if he had intended to stop writing at 7 books, that isn't necessarily conclusive evidence that he wouldn't have written more. It's certainly not unheard of for authors to continue to add to the canon of their works long after the fact (notably, for example, J. K. Rowling). The counter to the above argument, of course, is that the original question was whether C. S. Lewis intended to write about the other universes. The fact that he might have written about them doesn't necessarily prove that he actually intended to do so. With that said, The Magician's Nephew is the only book that even mentions that there are other parallel universes. While The Magician's Nephew was admittedly the second-to-last book, the fact that none of the other books (even The Last Battle, which was written after The Magician's Nephew) even mention it strongly suggests that he didn't particularly intend to write about the other ones. In fact, from a plot perspective, the main reason they visit Charn at all was to bring the White Witch into Narnia. He also kind of needed the Wood between the Worlds to make the plot of Magician's Nephew make sense. We also have the fact that the magic rings used to reach the Wood Between the Worlds were buried at the end of the book, clearly implying that the characters didn't intend for anyone to use them ever again. Also, the Narnia series was published at the rate of approximately 1 book a year from 1950 - 1956. C. S. Lewis died in 1963 without writing any more books. Finally, the Chronicles of Narnia series is the Chronicles of Narnia. The fact that Narnia ended in The Last Battle, and the fact that the series covers Narnia from beginning to end, suggests that he didn't intend to write about any of the others (at least in the Chronicles of Narnia). They fundamentally wouldn't be the chronicles of Narnia at that point, they'd be the chronicles of other universes. Some C. S. Lewis scholars, most notably Michael Ward in Planet Narnia, have argued that the choice of 7 books was not coincidental. This article in Christianity Today describes that further. To quote from that book: 

In a real sense, then, people wanted to believe the truth. Given a reason, they could "come out of their stupor" in a sense. These people, while they were "caught up" in the bad philosophy of the day, apparently lacked the fundamental malice of Jim Taggart and Wesley Mouch. They were still capable of responding to the truth, unlike people like Dr. Robert Stadler (who knew better) or Wesley Mouch (who was fundamentally malicious and power-hungry). In terms of why Dagney seemingly chose at random, the book doesn't really answer this. However, I suspect that the fact that someone volunteered would, in and of itself, seem to suggest that they were up for the job. In that moment, they saw the value of the John Galt Line, which suggested that they would be able to run it. 

The entire storyline of Othello is precipitated by Iago's resentment over being passed over for a promotion in favor of Cassio. That being said, why doesn't it seem to occur to Othello that Iago might have reacted this way? 

Not coincidentally, the entire thing is read in a robotic, synthesized voice. Clearly, this is referring to the "deadening," entrapping effects of the lifestyle in question. Wikipedia describes this as follows:
