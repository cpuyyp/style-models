It does look like you would be classed as an employee under IR35 however you would need to get a lawyer to check this and to draft an IR35 friendly contract. $URL$ Supervision, Substitution, Mutuality of obligation and Control are some of the key areas HMRC look at to determine if you are a true self employed. Oh and remember the rule of thumb is charge 3x the rate that a full time employee would get as an employee. 

The best way to handle this would be to say you have to work your notice period in any event and say that is after the consultation period closes. The other option is to ask HR not your boss if there is a VR (voluntary redundancy) option you could take. This is obviously a big company paying contractual redundancy as you don't qualify for statutory redundancy as you haven't worked there long enough so a VR option maybe more generous. Also if you do get the new employer to pay you a bonus you have to ask for more to make up for the fact that redundancy payments are tax free (up to a point) 

NO Unfortunately in the world of work you cannot assume that you will even get a payrise let alone one greater then inflation. I would assume that the wildly generous estimates you quote have been set politically to flatter the organisation by implying that amount repaid will be higher. Implying that all graduating students wont get married and have kids is another sign of this. 

I've worked for companies that had policies regarding this sort of thing, but I don't think there are any over arching labor laws. Some of these policies included things like: 

It appears that Colorado has some pretty broad DUI laws: A specific instance of lawn mower DUI with some explanation The DUI/DWAI statute The Colorado Department of Transportation's "Marijuana and Driving" FAQ 

I'm struggling with a direct supervisor, who just doesn't seem to pull his own weight. Basically my supervisor is expected to be a "working manager", so his time is split between 15% administrative tasks and 85% doing the same job I do. I understand that he has admin responsibilities that pull him away from day to day tasks, no problem there, but it seems more and more that the quality of his work in the field is sub-standard. Which leaves the bulk of the work undone, or worse done poorly and the rest of the department is left to scramble to meet deadlines and fix his "mistakes". (To be clear, its not that I just have a high standards, he often scolds the whole department for things that he did, or didn't do.) It seems that any one of his subordinates can accomplish more in 4 hours than he usually gets done in 2 or 3 days. I'm thinking it may be time to make the higher management aware of the problem, before things boil over, but I'm unsure of how to approach the situation. Should I go to higher management with my concerns, and if so, how can I report the situation without coming across as in-subordinate? 

I would take the developer role as unfortunately QA/test doesn’t really have the cachet that a developer does. And sorry bharat two years in test isn’t going to help if you want to be a developer. What you and the other answer doesn’t take into account is the federal job comes with much better benefits in terms of leave and pension a DB plus a DC top up (with a 5% match) which is much better than any FANG - also effectively working a 9 day fortnight is nice. So when you try and compare the two offers you have to take this into account and also you do have to decide (which it looks like you have) that you are ok with defence work and also are ok with going through the security clearance process. 

This looks like the Scottish version of CRB checks (basic checks against the legal records). In your case I would hire a lawyer/ specialist (on the companies dime) to produce a proper procedure and information for those going through the checks. 

This appears to be the statutory minimum notice in the UK its not that uncommon. Yes it is acceptable to take a job with the aim of eventually finding something better. In almost all cases its better to be working as you are building up qualifying years for things like state benefits and also missing any employer provided pension payments. Its also easier to get a job if you are already working. Also in the current climate rejecting a job offer can cause problems in claiming benefits, even more so if you in an area that uses Universal Credit. 

I had a job where I worked a couple weeks for a temp agency. The hours were long and they owe me a large amount of money, which I need. The other day I got an email saying they had forgotten to get me to sign the contract for employment. The job is already finished, and essentially they are withholding pay until I sign and send in the contract. Now, the contract is fairly standard and nothing really bad about it. Though I feel very uncomfortable and this was unprofessional of them. The contract did contain information that would have allowed me to do my job better if I had received it before work (for example knowing the hierarchy of the team). I already have in writing my work schedule and pay rate. This contract is mostly legally jargon e.g. “we will not claim any responsibility or liability for any accident while attending training sessions or during any event you work or for damaged or lost personal belongings.” One part of the contract said I must show up 15 minutes before each shift and can’t be late. I didn’t know to do this so I didn’t. Is it even legal to include this as it’s unpaid work? Anyway, at this point what’s my best course of action? I would like to just sign it and get my pay but was thinking I could include a message in the email that I was unaware of this prior to work. According to the law, the date the contract is signed is when it becomes enforceable, so I’m not sure if signing it now could make a difference? No incidences occurred during this work and I don’t think anyone plans on suing anyone. EDIT: I don't think hiring a lawyer is a practical solution as I would end up loosing money and making none. 

Most of these things are just common sense and good business practice. Even assuming that a visitor is dropping in for business purposes, it's a good idea to make sure that they were expected and that you're prepared to greet them. 

I'm kinda surprised that no one mentioned this yet, but compelling people to participate in any "holiday celebration" is assuming that it is a holiday for everyone. Basically not everyone celebrates these holidays and forcing people to participate, in what could be seen as religious holidays, could be an HR nightmare. Even if this isn't your reason, you could drop that bug in someone's ear and get the whole thing called off. "You know I like the holidays as much as anyone, but have you considered..." 

A portfolio website can say a lot about you as a programmer/developer and that's largely why I would advise against hiring it out. If it ends up looking great and an interviewer, particularly a web savy interviewer, likes it and asks how you did X, it may look bad if you don't know. Also, not to put too fine a point on it, there may be an inclination for an interviewer to think "what sort of programmer can't handle simple HTML and a little css?" Your site doesn't necessarily need to be "fancy". Simple, clean, and maintainable should probably be the goal. Keep in mind that it's a resume/portfolio not your usual internet click bait. 

How does one write a good resignation letter? Should the reason for quitting be included? I had recently started a job. The person responsible for training was on vacation so the main manager trained us for a couple hours, then handed us off to a random person (in the sense it wasn’t her job to train) for a bit more. I’ve been told by others we weren’t properly trained and I certainly feel I lack training. Also I did not know before starting that this job was essentially on call and would receive little notice of the time and location to work at. I was never trained how to read the schedule (I know it sounds strange, but they have a very complicated way of communicating work times and locations). In my resignation letter I don’t want it to sound that I’m blaming the manager for not being trained. Should I give any reason and if so what should it be? Obviously I’m not going to say “I quit because you didn’t train me” but should I include “sorry I missed a shift, I was never trained how to use the schedule”? EDIT: this is a government subsidiary and I don't want to burn any bridges in case I want to work for the government again in the future. 

The root of humiliation is humility... It's an unfortunate situation, but try to be humble about the whole thing. If you overhear any further discussion about the matter laugh it off. Also... self deprecating humor can go a long way in taking the wind out of peoples jokes about it. Let them laugh with you rather than at you. "Well, I really shouldn't have trusted that and I really, really should have called in... let that be a lesson to all of you... Move along, nothing to see here." 

$URL$ This seems like a pretty important contextual detail why was it edited out? I'm a little surprised that this hasn't been mentioned before, but donating your hair for this reason is a real thing. $URL$ I remember a number of girls, who I grew up with, growing out and then cutting off 10 inches of their hair for this purpose. It was sort of like their "ice bucket challenge" I can appreciate that you're not interested in cutting your hair, but this isn't necessarily gender based harassment or him picking on you. He may just be trying to raise awareness for a charitable organization... The easiest way to get him to stop is probably to just tell him something like: 

To directly answer the question - which no one has done yet. Stick to a minimum of 10 Point Anything less risks being hard to read to read and you can't assume that every reader has 20/20 vision and you risk getting your cv discarded especially if its being read by an older person Don't get to hung up on exact numbers about the number of pages in a cv there is no magic trick here.

Normally a good rule of thumb is to triple your day rate as an employee when going self employed if your committing to a long contract of a year or more you could reduce this a bit. Pseudo self employed - This worries me in many countries the tax authorities see this as disguised employment and treat it as tax evasion. You would need to check carefully with a lawyer that you aren't going to get into trouble 

Simply put... Believe it or not... Some people cheat. If the drug test is disclosed up front it gives people who are going to cheat an opportunity to do so. As mentioned in another answer, some people will just clean up for a few weeks before the test in order to pass. Others will try to use one of the never ending commercially available products to try to beat the test. Like it or not, it's a reality and a financial reality too. Sending people to a lab for testing isn't cheap, but employers often get discounts on insurance for doing so. They also do this to limit their liability. If you're ever injured on the job you can expect to be tested. If you fail, you'll lose your benefits and most likely your job as well. 

To more directly answer the question... Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine. Be honest about your skills in interviews, keep working hard, and keep learning. 

To more directly answer the question... Yes it is harassment, and no it doesn't matter if you're gay. Though unfortunately in a lot of places people aren't protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Your best bet is to get out quickly and consider consulting an attorney after you've secured a new job. 

I know maturity level is more important than age, but I also know any thing taken to an extreme is ridiculous. I have been in touch with an international marketing firm and had been invited in for a second interview. The person interviewing me looked awfully young and was dressed in a very stereotypical suit. At one point he asked me my age (which, by the way, I heard is illegal?) and I answered. I asked him the question back and he said 19. He seemed like a typical 19 year old, for example he talked about how winter is his favorite season as he can go snowboarding then. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong about being 19 or snowboarding, but I'm not sure I would be comfortable having someone this young in a management position. He had some young tendencies that most people his age have. It has been my experience that employers like to hear would google search something to find how to do it, but when I told him this he didn't like it and I remember back in grade school it was consider cheating to "google search the answer" (though obviously in the work place that's what you do). I don't know how to take it that the second round interview was conducted by a 19 year old kid. Also there was some other questionable circumstances, like how we ended up going to Starbucks for the interview as apparently the office was in the middle of moving.
