A minister normally resigns by sending a letter to the Prime Minister, informing her of his intent to resign, and normally giving reasons for the resignation. The announcement may be made by the government, or by the minister. The resignation is normally effective immediately. The minister remains a member of the House of Commons, or House of Lords, since quitting those bodies is an entirely separate matter. They loose their ministerial salary and other services, such as a government car and driver, and in most cases, their security. Some resigned ministers have continued to have security after they'd left their position: notably some past Northern Ireland Secretaries, who were at risk of assassination, continued to have security for years afterwards. I don't know if this still applies. That's about it, really. The process is probably less controlled by legislation than in many other countries, because quite a bit of the UK's constitution is based on custom and precedent. A minister is doubtless free to brief his successor if he wishes, but this is not required, and the civil service will brief the new minister anyway. 

As congusbongus wrote, this idea seems to originate in S.L.A. Marshal's Men Against Fire. I examined the book carefully a few years ago, and found that the whole idea seems to start in one scenario, which he generalised from WWII interviews with US soldiers in Europe. An inexperienced infantry company is given orders to advance, without any kind of fire support. It does so, until it comes under effective fire from a well-concealed enemy, at which point the troops instinctively go to ground. At this point, nobody takes charge. The NCOs do not give the men orders to position themselves better, or organise fire. The officers don't give the NCOs orders. Nobody tells the commander about casualties, or provides him with any information. Under these circumstances, 25% of the men firing in a useful way is actually pretty good. Marshall explicitly says that he doesn't think NCOs should be organising the men, but should be setting an example by firing. This doesn't work well when a unit is pinned down by enemy fire, because the men are at risk of being shot if they look around very much, so they won't see anyone setting an example. Other armies don't expect as much individual heroism as Marshal seems to. When the unit goes to ground, there won't be much immediate fire in response. But the squad NCOs will be getting their men organised and passing information up the chain of command. Within a minute or so, most of the men will be firing, and they'll be doing it at selected targets, rather than the most obvious thing they could see from the positions they ended up in when they went to ground. Marshal seems to have misinterpreted the problems faced by the US Army in WWII, where drastic expansion meant there was a terrible shortage of NCOs with combat experience. Interpreting the resulting difficulties as being due to fundamentals of human nature may have been very agreeable to the heads of the army, but it doesn't seem to have been accurate. 

This was Operation Magic Carpet. The Wikipedia article explains it, and has a link to the more general article on demobilisation of US forces after WWII. 

Like most large cities, Moscow had a coal gas supply during this period. Coal gas is made, naturally enough, from coal. There's a short history of the Moscow gas system online. To summarise: The initial system was put in for street lighting in 1865, by entrepreneurs from England and Holland. By 1905, there were over 215 kilometres of gas pipeline, 8735 gas lights in the street, and 3720 private consumers. In 1914, gas production was 18.7 million cubic metres per year, and in 1941, it was 176.1 million cubic metres per year, with 62,300 apartments connected. That was a fairly small proportion of the housing in Moscow. I suspect most of the gas was used by industrial plant, since there was plenty of that in Moscow. In 1946, there was a start on constructing natural gas pipelines. From 1948, liquefied gas was sold in tanks. In 1957, the production of coal gas in Moscow ended. 

Adding to Pieter Geerkens' answer, in 1944 the Germans were retreating at high speed when the battle front crossed the Zone, and did not attempt to use it. At that time, doing so would have just caused them pointless casualties, since their units were shattered and disorganised. Source: Victory in the West, volume II, The Defeat of Germany, the British official history, which doesn't consider the Zone significant enough in context to mention. 

If the British Isles are within your range, the Pipe Rolls survived in a continuous series from 1155, with some earlier ones also extant. The UK National Archives has information online about how to access them. The Pipe Roll Society is dedicated to publishing them. Unless you're a Latin scholar, you'll want to access someone else's research into the rolls to get the kind of information you're looking for. 

Müller was a "general with special duties" on the staff of OKH. This made him the top legal officer for the Heer, the German Army, but meant he had no jurisdiction over the Luftwaffe, Navy or SS. He wrote the first draft of the commissar order, but he doesn't seem to have originated the idea. That happened in a speech by Hitler to a large group (200-250) of senior officers on March 30th 1941, at the New Reich Chancellery. It lasted over two hours, and many of them don't seem to have noticed the instruction to commit war crimes, according to Walter Warlimont's memoirs, although those are often self-serving. Müller was ordered to produce a draft order on 31st March 1941, apparently by Halder, and his legal adviser, Dr Lattmann, also produced one. These were merged, amended by various people, finally approved by Hitler and circulated by OKW. It was recognised in OKH and OKW that the commissar order was contrary to international law, and Warlimont at OKW wanted to consider if such a written order was actually necessary. However, it all went ahead. Müller doesn't seem to have been a priority for individual war crimes prosecution, being treated as a functionary. He was presumably considered part of the "General Staff and High Command" within the first Nuremberg Trial. Sources: Warlimont's memoirs, and volume IV "The Attack on the Soviet Union," of Germany and the Second World War. 

The Japanese had no real idea how many atomic bombs might be available. They had not had any specific knowledge of the Manhattan Project. Their scientists were aware of the possibility that such bombs could be built, and they had a small atomic weapons research project (it didn't get anywhere). Once the first bomb was dropped, their scientists realised what had happened within about two days, although explaining it to the military and politicians was harder. Using the second bomb relatively quickly may have been intended to give the impression that there were plenty more. Another would have been ready for August 19th, with three more in September and three in October. Richard B Frank's Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire is a pretty good source on this period. 

It is entirely normal for cities in empires to erect monuments to emperors. The exact practices vary between countries, but there seem to have been at least 425 to Wilhelm I erected between his death in 1888 and 1918. It was unusual in Prussia to build monuments to living royals, even before the creation of the empire, so there were few before his death. A more meaningful question would be "Who decided to put up this monument to him in Bonn?" That was likely just a group of patriotic local citizens who could raise the money, and obtain the agreement of the city's authorities and permission from the then-current Kaiser, Wilhelm II. 

The UK has never had a single-document constitution like the US one. There are occasionally moves to create one, but they never get anywhere. There are a number of acts of parliament of fundamental constitutional importance, such as the Bill of Rights (1689) and the Act of Settlement (1701). There are also some key court decisions, which are parts of the common law, and the Royal Prerogative (nowadays exercised, in practice, by the government). There are conventions that have evolved over time about the operation of Parliament, and several books that record and generalise constitutional principles that are regarded as reasonably authoritative. But there is no document that you can refer to that tells you what the whole constitution is. This has some surprising advantages. It is far easier to create a constitutional crisis than is the case under a formal constitution, which means that everyone is careful not to do it and a degree of consensus is maintained, which limits the scope for abuse of power. The constitution can also change gradually, by consensus, and changes that don't work can be reversed easily. And being literal-minded about the constitution, or anything else, just isn't respectable. 

German Wikipedia has a page on him, with references to books that mention him, and there's a more here and here. Google Books has Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany online with a bunch of references to Pohl, and Lessons and Legacies VI: New Currents in Holocaust Research with more. Searching on "Johannes Pohl 1904" gets you the right man and avoids confusion with the more recent psychologist. The "Pohl Trial" in Nuremberg was of Oswald Pohl, a different man. 

The Wikipedia article you linked to has the explanation. Bernadotte was killed by the Lehi group, also known as the Stern Gang. 

An invasion by US armed forces would have worked, but would also have been deeply illegal, since it would have been a war of aggression, and would also likely have precipitated a war with the Soviet Union. The plan seems to have started as one for a counter-revolution within Cuba with outside support, and been expanded into a plan for overt military action without that being properly thought through. The forces that landed, composed of Cuban exiles, were too small for the job and didn't have enough supplies or support. They also assumed they would have support from the population, but actually, most of them were pro-Castro. Wikipedia's summary of the CIA internal report on the fiasco covers the matter reasonably well. 

The 1st Watch Officer was the second-in-command. Where Mulligan gives two possible ranks, the higher rank would be for more experienced officers, with a slight bias towards them commanding larger boats. In addition, there could be a commanding officer in training, presumably an officer who hadn't served in submarines before who was converting to the work, or a medical officer. There would also be one or two apprentice officers, Fähnrich zur See, but Mulligan groups them with the seaman senior NCOs. 

The Norwegian Rocket Incident appears to have prompted the opening of the Russian Federation's briefcase. That Wikipedia article says that was the only such incident, but that seems unlikely to me. 

Pearl Harbour was (edit) the base where most of the US Pacific Fleet was deployed, and the intention was to attack the fleet in harbour. That was because ships that are stationary are much easier to hit with bombs and torpedoes. Staging the attack required knowing that the fleet was actually at its base, but that was hard to hide - ships are big and easy to see - and the Japanese had a consulate nearby that could make reports. The point of the attacks was to cripple the Pacific Fleet and thus prevent it from interfering with the attacks that the Japanese intended to make on US possessions nearer to Japan (The Philippines, Wake Island and Guam were also attacked over the next few hours) and on British and Dutch possessions that were also attacked. If the Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers been present at Pearl Harbour at the time of the attack, they would also likely have been damaged or sunk. It was a matter of chance that they were away on missions. Wikipedia has a decent overview of the reasons for the attack and an account of the action. (edit) Any fleet going to attack the Panama Canal or California would have to be fairly small, so as to be able to take enough fuel along in tankers for the return trip. The obvious reason for not doing that is that the fleet would be intercepted by the US Pacific Fleet on its way back, and sunk. Attacking the Panama Canal effectively is tricky. Attacking California is pointless - you can't do damage that will cripple the US war effort. But destroying the whole Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour would cripple the warfighting ability of the USA. The Japanese attack was intended to do just that, but did not succeed. 

This does not appear to be true. There's no mention of it in Weinberg's A World at Arms, which is about the best one-volume history of WWII. The German multi-volume history Germany and the Second World War covers this period in volume 2, Germany's Initial Conquests in Europe, pages 118-126. The German High Command, OKW, does not appear to have expected the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland. OKW laid down a maximum limit to the German advance on 17th September and required units beyond that line to pull back. Subsequent lines were laid down every day from 18th to 21st September, pulling German forces back to the "four rivers" boundary line that had been agreed on 23rd August, backed up by orders from Hitler. The intention was to keep German and Soviet troops apart, and to give the Germans time to move back wounded, prisoners, and their own and captured material. Another reason for doing it in stages was to avoid giving various undefeated Polish forces time and space to regroup. The Germans hoped to revise the agreed boundary, and there were various changes, but the Polish oil fields had always been on the Soviet side of the line, and stayed there. There was no fighting involved in the Red Army taking them over, according to both of these sources. 

Communications weren't quick It would have taken hours for the news to reach all the units on the western front. Radios were not in widespread use, so many telephone calls would have had to be made to many headquarters. They would then have had to send messengers to all their sub-units that didn't have telephones. If one side stops shooting, and the other doesn't, fighting will just restart There would be no way to guarantee that the word of the cease-fire, spreading separately on the two sides of the lines, would reach the same areas at the same time. So if side A got an order "Stop fighting immediately," and side B hadn't heard, A would stop, and B would carry on, causing casualties on side A. In fact B would be more effective than usual, because they weren't having to look out for enemy fire. Pretty soon, A would start firing again, because being shot at while having the means to shoot back, but being forbidden to do so is very hard on the nerves. So it was necessary to give some notice if everyone was to stop simultaneously. 

Large gliders became obsolete. They were easy to detect once radars had become smaller and more common than they were during WWII. Their ability to evade radar-controlled anti-aircraft fire would have been very limited, and surface-to-air missiles would slaughter them. Helicopters were much more versatile, could fly significant distances very low to avoid radar, and could extract troops as well as insert them. They were more useful all round, so they replaced specialist glider units. The remaining advantage of gliders is quietness. Some special operations forces may train with hang-gliders for quiet small-scale insertions, but such operations tend not to be publicised.
