It is easy to tile e.g. a $1\times a$ rectangle for $1<a<2$ by four isosceles triangles, but with two of them being equal. In the case that $a=\sqrt{\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}2}$, we are lucky and can split one of those into two smaller ones, obtaining a tiling into 5 different isosceles triangles (with all occurring angles being multiples of $\frac\pi{10}$). BTW, we can iterate that by splitting the blue triangle again etc., getting tilings of the same rectangle into $k$ different isosceles triangles for all $k\ge5$. 

Let $P(x)$ be an irreducible monic polynomial of degree $\ge4$ with integer coefficients. We all know that over a finite field $\mathbb F_p$, $P$ will often split, and I am interested in polynomials with the property that, for any given $p$, all splitting factors in $\mathbb F_p[x]$ have the same degree. Call such polynomials "uniformly splitting". (This doesn't exclude the possibility that for certain $p$, they may remain irreducible.) E.g. it is not hard to see that $P(x)=x^4-x^2+1$ is uniformly splitting, because it will never split into two linear factors and one quadratic irreducible one. I suspect the situation is similar for $P(x)=x^8-x^6+x^4-x^2+1$. (Is it really?) On the other hand, e.g. $P(x)=x^8-x^6-x^4-x^2+1$ splits uniformly for all $p<43$, so far so good, but in $\mathbb F_{43}$, we have $$P(x)=(9+x) (19+x) (24+x) (34+x) (14+x^2) (40+x^2).$$ 

Inspired by this question, in particular by the indeed elegant description of the Mathieu group $M_{23}$ it starts with, I am wondering about the following: Instead of $C$, defined as the multiplicative subgroup of order $23$ in the field $F=\mathbb F_{2^{11}}$ with $2^{11}=23\cdot89+1$ elements, let us take the "complementary" subgroup $D$ of order $89$. Knowing that $M_{23}$ is the group of additive maps of $F$ to itself which permute the set $C$, what about the group $G$ of additive maps of $F$ to itself which permute the set $D$ instead? Naively, I would expect this group $G$ to be also a simple group by "duality", but it cannot be a sporadic one because of the divisor $89$. 

By the latter I mean the following: I wonder if generally speaking, the shift from an entity to its q-analog(s) can be likened, at least sometimes, to the shift of passing from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb C$, in the sense that some q-analogs provide a more complete picture than the entity itself (cp. for the $\mathbb R\to\mathbb C$ case the fundamental theorem of algebra or the meromorphic extension of the zeta function)? 

This is about properties of certain fractals defined by Lindenmayer systems, a.k.a. L-systems. Unlike “classical” fractals like Julia sets or the Mandelbrot set (the name “set” says it all), these fractals are not defined by calculus, but rather geometically, by iterating certain drawing procedures and resizing, which often results in a well-defined limit "curve." Some fractals, e.g. the well-known dragon curve, can be defined by very different L-systems. I am mainly interested here in fractals where the self-similarity can be seen by decomposing shapes into smaller similar shapes (similar in the strict sense). Which angles can appear between similar shapes? E.g. for the Heighway dragon curve, it is easy to see directly from some of the L-system formulae defining it that these angles are $k\pi/8$. Now I have encountered L-systems featuring angles which do not seem related to the one in the formula. E.g. for the following one, the angle between the biggest "hole" and the next-to-biggest one below it (colored blue) is about $70°$. (Note that it is smaller than $72°=2\pi/5$). This fractal has been obtained by the formula 

It is well known that some transcendental numbers like e.g. rational multiples of $e^{2/n}$ with $n\in\mathbb N $, when written as regular continued fractions (R.C.F.), yield what can be called a quasi periodic form, meaning that the terms, after possibly an aperiodic onset, are 'periodic' but with some of them undergoing linear shifts, e.g. $e^{1/n} = [1 ; 3n-1,1,1,5n-1,1,1,7n-1,1,1,...]=:[1 ; \overline{(2\lambda +1)n-1,1,1}]$, where $\lambda$ is meant to run through $1,2,3,...$. Sometimes the periodic part is also written as $K_{\lambda=1}^\infty[(2\lambda +1)n-1,1,1]$. So this R.C.F. has period 3, and one of the three periodic terms is shifted by $2n$ each time. If we take the most general form $x=\dfrac{ae^{2/n}+b}{ce^{2/n}+d}\ $ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z$ and $ad\ne bc$, it appears that the (periodic part of the) R.C.F. of $x$ is built of quite simple patterns. Let me first give two "typical" examples: For $x=\dfrac{3e-3}{e+1}$, the R.C.F. has period 10 and is given by 

This is inspired by the recent question How many solutions $\pm1\pm2\pm3…\pm n=0$. The oeis entries A063865 linked to this question and A292476/A156700 for the related one "How many solutions $\pm1\pm3\pm5…\pm n=0$" give the asymptotics as $n\to\infty$, respectively $$\sqrt{\frac6 \pi}\frac{2^n}{n^{3/2}}\quad \text{ and }\quad 2\sqrt{\frac6\pi}\frac{2^{n/2}}{n^{3/2}} $$ (the first one only applies for $n \equiv 0$ or $3 \pmod 4$, the second one only for $n \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, as otherwise there are no solutions). Note that in the second one, I have replaced $4n-1$ by $n$, with the outcome that both asymptotic formulae become very similar. This naturally raises the question for the asymptotics of the number of solutions in other arithmetic progressions: 

Not a complete answer but a heuristic argument that there is little hope for a good estimation, let alone an exact solution. Take the matrix $$\pmatrix{a&b&.&.&.&.&.&.\\ .&.&a&b&.&.&.&.\\ .&.&.&.&a&b&.&.\\ .&.&.&.&.&.&a&b\\ a&b&.&.&.&.&.&.\\ .&.&a&b&.&.&.&.\\ .&.&.&.&c&d&.&.\\ .&.&.&.&.&.&c&d }$$ which is a special case of an $8\times 8$ "equivalent" (sort of) and has the characteristic polynomial $$x^3\left[x^5-(a+d)x^4+a(d-b)x^3+b(a+d)(ad-bc)x-b(ad-bc)^2\right].$$ Now, the factor in brackets is of form $x^5+px^4+qx^3+rx+s$ with linearly independant coefficients (in terms of $a,b,c,d$), i.e. a quintic in almost general form, with just the $x^2$ term missing. AFAIK this has no closed form solution, and I wonder if there are reasonable estimates of its maximal root in terms of $p,q,r,s$. 

Let $z=a+bi\in\mathbb C$ with $b\ne0$ be an algebraic complex number of minimal degree $n$. It is obvious that $a=\dfrac {z+\bar{z}}2$ and $b=\dfrac {z-\bar{z}}{2i}$ are also algebraic. For $n=3$, it is easy to see form Cardano's formula that $a$ is of minimal degree $3$ and that $b$ must be in general of minimal degree $6$. For general $n$, it is also clear from looking at $iz$ that the minimal degree of $b$ is "at worst" the double of the one of $a$. Question: 

Call this number $p(\mathcal T)$ and define for a tile $p(T):=\max_{\mathcal T} p(\mathcal T)$. For example, the Voderberg tile has $p(T)\ge60$ and supposedly $p(T)=60$. But is it even clear that $p(T)$ is always finite? Theoretically a tile containing irrational angles might occur in infinitely many positions, or is there an easy combinatorial argument against that? A related probably easier question arises if we require $T$ to be convex. 

EDIT: Yes, of course we can, as per Wlodek Kuperberg's comment. This excludes the possibility of self-similarity only partially, so to speak. So I will squeeze this out by sharpening the conditions as follows: 

As already said in my comment, there is no link between $f(n)$ for $n<0$ and the odd zeta values occurring for $n>0$. For $n<0$, putting $k:=-n>0$, we have $f(-k)=\dfrac2\pi\int\limits_0^{\frac\pi2}\dfrac{\sin^{2k} z}{z^{2k} }dz$. After one integration by parts, we remain with some negative power of $\pi$ and an integral $\int \limits_0^{\frac\pi2}\dfrac{\sin^{2k-1} z\cos z}{z^{2k-1} }dz.$ Performing $2k-2$ more integrations by parts, all the remaining integrals are a combination $$\sum_{j=1}^k a_j\int\limits_0^{\frac\pi2} \dfrac{\sin^{2j-1} z\cos z}{z }dz.$$ By the multiple angle formulae, we can write the numerators as linear combinations of $\sin 2rz$ with $r=1,...,j$, thus evaluating the integrals as multiples of $Si(\pi),...,Si(k\pi)$. As an example, $f(-1)=\frac2\pi\int_0^{\frac\pi2}\frac{\sin^2 z}{z^2}dz=\frac2\pi\left[\frac{2 z Si(2 z) + \cos(2 z) - 1}{2z}\right]_{z=0}^{z=\frac\pi2}=\frac2\pi(Si(\pi)-\frac2\pi)$. 

Based on the answer to this question, I am wondering: Let $n>8$ and $G$ a finite group for which all orders of its elements are contained in $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$ (denote the set of all such groups by $\mathcal G_n$). How big can $\dfrac{|\mathcal O(G)|}{n}$ be as $n$ grows? Here $\mathcal O(G)$ denotes the set of all orders of elements of $G$. From the previous question, we know $f(n):=\max\limits_{G\in \mathcal G_n} \dfrac{|\mathcal O(G)|}{n}<1$ for $n>8$. 

Not an answer yet but too long for a comment. For the $a_n$ as in მამუკა ჯიბლაძე's answer, it is worth to look at even and odd indices separately. In fact, for $n$ odd, $a_n$ only seems to have terms for $x^{n-4k}$ and $[x^{n-4k}]a_n=[x^{n-4k-1}]a_{n-1}$, so all the information is contained in the even polynomials. Writing $r$ for $\varepsilon_{2^r}$ and keeping the signs, we have the following coefficients: $\begin{array} {rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr} n&|&x^{n-2}&x^{n-4}&.&x^{n-8}&.&.&.&x^{n-16}\\ \hline 2&|&1\\ \hline 4&|&2&12\\ 6&|&-1&&-2\\ \hline 8&|& 3&-13&&-23\\ 10&|& 1&&-3&-23&-123\\ 12&|& -2&-12&&&3&13\\ 14&|& -1&&2&&&&-3\\ \hline 16&|& 4&-14&&24&&&&-34\\ 18&|& 1&&-4&24&124&&&-34&-134\\ 20&|& 2&12&&&4&14&&-34&-234&-1234\\ 22&|& -1&&-2&&&&-4&-34&134&&234\\ \end{array}$ Except for the signs, which keep some mystery, the patterns of the columns seem already essentially predictable, everything in terms if the A006519 sequence. If you compute some more lines, it should be entirely clear (e.g. what happens in the 5th column?), and from there of course possible to prove that by some induction. If one adds to your list of $\varepsilon_{n}$'s the lines $\varepsilon_{2^k}=\varepsilon_{2^k}$ for completeness, then the pattern of indices 2,2,4,4,2,2,8,8,2,2,4,4,2,2,16,16... in particular also should be isomorphic to the (doubled) A006519 sequence. But the signs...? (Sadly, $\varepsilon_{22}=-\varepsilon_{2}$.) Also note that the "main diagonal" of this table (i.e. the array of the absolute terms of the even $a_n$), taken as a binary code, seems to encapsulate a bijection $ 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4, 12, 13, 15, 14, ...$ from $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$, more precisely the Gray code A003188. 

As far as characterizing rigid O-circuits which are not FO, I'd guess this is even more difficult. I don't see a reason though to think that they are more frequent than FO ones, so maybe their number is finite, too? (In fact, are there any at all? - see below.) The minimal size of such a circuit is $n\ge 7$: for $n=4$ there is only a trivial one, FO of type , for $n=5$ it is not hard to show that no O-circuit exists, for $n=6$, if the vertices of an O-circuit are numbered $v_1, ..., v_6$, then $v_1, v_3, v_5$ have pairwise distance $\sqrt{2}$, likewise $v_2, v_4, v_6$. So it is rigid (because the equilateral triangles of side $\sqrt{2}$ are 'rigid') and must be FO of type . 

Just to visualize your zeros. This shows that their distribution seems indeed "quite regular", but nevertheless with some lettle "dents", e.g. they are not on a concave/convex curve, and the distances of consecutive ones do not decrease monotonously. 

The setup is similar to this question, but generalizes the size of the Hankel matrix. We'll define $$d(n,k,r):=\det\left(\binom{2i+2j+k+r}{i+j}\right)_{i,j=0}^{kn-1}.$$ Edit: Thanks to Johann Cigler for checking, which made me discover that the originally given formula $d(n,k,r):=\det\left(\binom{2i+2j+k}{i+j}\right)_{i,j=0}^{kn-1+r}$ was not the one I used in my implementation. Sorry for that! So in fact my generalization only concerns matrix sizes that are multiples of $k$. Now I am not sure if the picture becomes more coherent when including other matrix sizes as well, but it may be wotrh giving it a look. The original question is the special case when $k$ is odd and $r=0$ and conjectures $d(n,k,0)=(2n+1)^\frac{k-1}{2}$. (For even $k$, we have $d(n,k,0)=(-1)^{ n\frac k2}$ according to Krattenthaler.) Computer experiments suggest that in the more general case, there is still a certain proportion of those determinants which are, up to sign, exact $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]^\text{th}$ powers (including $\pm1$), while the others are not only no powers but usually have quite large prime factors (e.g. see the two grey entries in the $k=4$ column just below). In the following I will ignore those other values and only consider those which are powers. It may not be a surprise that they all come in intriguing patterns. E.g. for $r=1$, the table of $d(n,k,1)$ starts with $$\begin{matrix} n \backslash k &2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11 \\ \hline \ 0 \quad| &1 &1 &1 &1 &1 &1 &1 &1 &1 &1\\ \ 1 \quad|&-4 & 8 & \color{grey} {\scriptstyle {(-61)}} & & & & & \\ \ 2 \quad| &3& -16& -8^2 & -24^2 & & & & \\ \ 3 \quad|&\color{red}5 &1 & \color{grey}{\scriptstyle {(5\cdot139)}} & -36^2 & 12^3 & -48^3 & & \\ \ 4 \quad|&\color{red}{-12} & 1 & 7^2 & & & 64^3 & 16^4 & 80^4 \\ \ 5 \quad|&\color{red}7 &32 & \color{blue}{9^2} & 1 & & & & 100^4& -20^5 & 120^5 \\ \ 6\quad|&9 &-40 & & -1 & 11^3 & & & & & -144^5 \\ \ 7 \quad|&-20 &1 & \color{blue}{-24^2} & & \color{red}{13^3} & 1 & & \\ \ 8 \quad|&11 &1 & & 84^2 & & 1 & 15^4 & \\ \ 9 \quad|&13 & 56 & \color{blue}{15^2} & 96^2 & & & 17^4 & 1 \\ 10\quad|&-28 & -64& 17^2& & \color{red}{36^3} & & & -1 & 19^5 \\ 11\quad|&15 & 1 & & & & -160^3 & & & 21^5 & 1 & \\ 12 \quad|&17 & 1 & -40^2 & & & 176^3 & & & & 1 & \\ 13 \quad|&-36 & 80 & & & \color{red}{23^3} & & 48^4 & \\ \end{matrix} $$ These first entries largely suffice to conjecture the general patterns of $d(n,k,1)$ for even and odd $k$. For $r=2,3,...$ the patterns are not too different from the ones encountered for $r=1$. (See at the end.) Instead of $d(n,k,r)$, wherever it is up to sign such a $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]^\text{th}$ power, let us consider the root $e(n,k,r)$ defined by $$e(n,k,r):=\sqrt[{\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2 \bigr]}]{|d(n,k,r)|} \in\mathbb N$$ If $r$ and $k$ are fixed, the $e(n+\lambda(k+r),k,r)_{\lambda\in\mathbb N_0}$ always seem to form an arithmetic sequence. For $k+r$ even, its difference is either $2k(r+k)$ or $0$ (in the latter case, we have the constant sequence $1,1,...$), i.e. the first conjecture will be 

Further, if $k$ and $r$ are coprime and moreover $(k+r)$ is odd, the $k^\text{th}$ column consists of equidistant triples (three of them are colored in the above table) such that the middle value of the root is the sum of the two others, e.g. from $d(10,4,1)$ and $d(12,4,1)$ we can guess $d(14,4,1)=23^2$. BTW, the middle value is always $\equiv0\pmod4$. So for these columns, the roots come in exactly $3$ arithmetic sequences. 

For given $n\geqslant 3$, I'm looking for a connected set composed of $n$ equal segments in the plane such that the convex hull of it has maximal area $A(n)$. To simplify notation, we'll take $\dfrac{2}{\sqrt[4]{3}}$ as the length of each segment, so the unit triangle has area $1$. It turns out that for small $n$, all the optimal solutions are Steiner trees, in the sense that each point belonging to more than one segment is the common endpoint of either two segments forming a straight line, or of three segments forming angles of $\dfrac{2\pi}{{3}}$. We'll call points of the latter kind branching points. Using Steiner trees with only one branching point and the three legs of almost same length, we get the trivial lower bounds $ \ \ \,\quad A(3k)\geqslant 3k^2$, $A(3k+1)\geqslant k(3k+2)$, $A(3k+2)\geqslant (k+1)(3k+1)$. Equally, we can write $A(n)\geqslant \left[\frac{n^2}3\right]= $ A000212 $(n)$. The oeis entry contains several interesting comments but nothing which immediately applies here. For a given $n$, there can be other Steiner trees of same length with more than one branching point which yield the same area. It might be an interesting question how many non-isomorphic ones exist, but before that, I want to ask the following: 

It is well known that several definite integrals $I_n$ containing a parameter $n\in\mathbb N$ can be expressed recursively (e.g. doing integration by parts) in terms of $I_{n-1} $ or $I_{n-2} $, and thus written as some expression containing factorials, e.g. the gamma function itself $$\int_0^\infty t^{n}e^{-t}dt=n\int_0^\infty t^{n-1}e^{-t}dt=\cdots=n!$$ Or take the formula $I_n:=\int_0^\pi \sin^nx\;dx=\dfrac{n-1}nI_{n-2}$, allowing to obtain $$\int_0^\pi \sin^{2n}x\;dx=\dfrac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}n!^2}\pi\ \ \text{ and }\ \int_0^\pi \sin^{2n+1}x\;dx=\dfrac{2^{2n+1}n!^2}{(2n+1)!}$$ (which BTW easily yields the Wallis product). As long as for such integrals the LHS is also defined for non-integer (say all positive real) $n$, 

Intuitively this should be true, but I have no idea how to construct such a matrix $S$. Note that this is not true when replacing everywhere "Galois-irreducibility" by "irreducibility of the characteristic polynomial" because any non-trivial Jordan blocks like $\begin{pmatrix}\lambda&1\\ 0&\lambda\\ \end{pmatrix}$ for, say, $\lambda\in\mathbb Z$, would yield a counterexample. In a similar vein: 

This is inspired by the self-similarity of the celebrated Golay-Rudin-Shapiro sequence, more exactly, of its alternating partial sums. (This latter one is oeis 020990). The pictures show the 550 first terms, then the 9000 first terms. 

On the other side, a striking example of a non ambivalent one is $\pi$, which is a period while $1/\pi$ probably isn't, likewise e.g. for $\ln2$. 

I couldn't resist to include a picture showing how asymmetric the distribution of roots can be for a bicycle polynomial. Here are the roots of $$z^{16}+2 z^{15}+z^{14}-2 z^{13}-4 z^{12}-2 z^{11}+3 z^{10}\\ +5 z^9+3 z^8+z^7-z^5-z^4-z^3+z^2+z+1,$$ which is an example of an extended Salem polynomial given by Dubickas and Smyth in their paper. 

More generally, for a partition $(p,q)$ with $p\ge q$, putting $$x=\frac{q}{p+q},y=\frac{p-q}{2(p+q)}, z=\frac12,$$ we have $x+y+z=1$ and can apply the discrete form of Hölder's inequality to obtain $$(a^{p+q}+b^pc^q)^x(b^q+c^q)^y(c^q+b^q)^z\ge a^{(p+q)x}b^{qy}c^{qz}+b^ {px+qz} c^{qx+qy}=(a^q+b^q)b^{qy} c^{qz} ,$$ which after multiplying all its cyclic permutations and dividing by $\prod\limits_{cyc}(a^q+b^q)^{y+z}$, leaves us with $$\prod\limits_{cyc} (a^{p+q}+b^pc^q)^x \ge \prod\limits_{cyc}(a^q+b^q)^{x}\prod\limits_{cyc}a^{q(y+z)}=\prod\limits_{cyc}(a^q+b^q)^{x}\prod\limits_{cyc}a^{px} ,$$ qed. This proof settles $k=2$. (The inequality is wrong for $p<q$). For $k\ge3$ and some special choices of $\alpha$, there are elegant proofs using Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder. But not for the general case. A bit of motivation: Looking at some famous inequalities of discrete variables like the power means inequality or Maclaurin's inequality, but also Cauchy-Schwarz, a recurrent principle is that for homogenous inequalities, the more "separated" the variables are, the bigger the expression, and the more "mixed" they are (in the sense of multiplied with each other), the smaller the expression. This coincides with the patterns in question here, giving some "empirical support" in favour of the conjecture. Even though the condition of non-increasing parts of $\alpha\vdash m$ does not seem always necessary for $k\ge 3$, I think the above conjecture is very tough. (Of course I would be happy to learn the contrary.) I don't even know of a proof for the simplest case of $k=3$, viz. $\alpha=(1,1,1)$, yielding $$\prod_{cyc}(a^3+bcd)\ge \prod_{cyc}(a^3+abc )$$ for $n\ge4$ variables. It might be possible to use some kind of majorization, but I don't see how. Based on strong numerical evidence, I also have a different "iff" conjecture for $k=3$:
