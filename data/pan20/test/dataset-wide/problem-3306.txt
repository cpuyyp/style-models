These trees illustrate the extent to which notions such as topic and focus are going to receive the same sort of explanation in both dependency- and constituency-based systems. These notions are taken care of by linear order alone, and the distinction between dependency and constituency has no bearing on topics and foci. On a multistratal approach, however, things become more complex, since dependency grammars that posit deep syntax also acknowledge information structure in deep syntax. The main dependency grammars that do this are Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) and Functional Generative Description (FGD). However,these DGs can nevertheless also assume that constituents (complete subtrees) are marked in deep syntax as topic or focus. In the mapping that occurs fron deep syntax to surface structure, a topic should then appear at the left periphery of the utterance. Now if the question is more concerned with how notions of FocP and TopP in Chomskian syntax translate to dependency grammar, that question is perhaps more difficult to anwer in a coherent manner. The difficulty stems from the fact that modern Chomskian syntax assumes all syntactic branching to be binary. This can lead to a large number of various functional categories, all located above the lexical domain in the syntactic hierarchy. What one has to ask oneself, though, is whether these functional categories can exist without linear order. That is, one has to ask oneself whether one can have a topic that does not appear at the left edge of the utterance. If no such topics are possible, the notion of topic cannot be separated from linear order, so there is no reason to locate the notion of topic in the syntactic hierarchy. But if one can have a topic that is not at the left periphery of the utterance, then one has to ask oneself what the Chomskian syntax tree would look like that acknowledges such a topic. For instance, can a topic follow the finite verb? I think many syntacticians would answer this question with "no". 

The best term to denote headstrong when it functions like a noun is nominal. The term nominal is broader than the the term noun. Any word that functions as the head of a noun phrase is a nominal. Thus if the head of a noun phrase looks like an adjective (e.g. the good, the helpful, the first, the best, etc.), then one can use the term "nominal" to denote it. The terminology in this area is of course not used consistently. There is confusion about the distinction between nouns, nominals, and substantives. For most of us, the noun concept is relatively clear. The term nominal is less clear, but my understanding of it is that it is a broader concept, encompassing nouns, pronouns, and any other word that functions as the head of a noun phrase. The term substantive is older and has fallen out of use. It seems to have been more prominent in the grammars of European languages. It denoted a noun in the narrow sense (not including pronouns and adjectives used as nouns). The class of adjectives that can be nominals if they are plural and introduced by the is large, e.g. the old, the fat, the skinny, the friendly, the robust, etc. But there may be an animacy requirement on the adjectives that are used in this way. It doesn't seem to work for adjectives that modify inanimate objects, e.g. *the wide, *the red, *the rough, *the smooth, etc. 

The adjective young is a direct dependent of the verb died, but it is a predication over the subject he, i.e. it assigns the property of youngness to he. In other words, young is behaving like an adverb/adjunct syntactically because it is a direct dependent of the lexical verb died, but it is definitely an adjective insofar as it looks like an adjective and is assigning a property to a (pro)noun. As Jlawler points out, the terminology used to denote these words varies. Some call them depictive adjuncts or participant-oriented adjuncts. Depictive adjuncts are stage-level predicates; the property that they assign is not an intrinsic characteristic of the noun, but rather its applicability is transient. Adjectives that assign intrinsic properties cannot occur in this use, e.g. 

The thing to note in this case is the manner in which one predicate-argument structure serves as the argument of another predicate. In other words, the theory of predicate-argument structures that one employs should be able to recognize the embedding of predicate-argument structures. There are many many further challenges facing any attempt to produce a typology of predicates. A third example: 

All syntactic structure is binary branching. All syntactic structure is right branching. Numerous empty elements are present in the structure, i.e. theta heads. All arguments merge as specifiers, whereby the predicates to which they belong appear originally to their right as complements of the empty theta heads. Leftward movement (actually copying) occurs on a massive scale in order to achieve surface word order. For instance, verbal predicates must move leftward in order to precede their object arguments, e.g. one wants eat meat instead of meat eat, one wants believe that it works instead of that it works believe, one wants say it instead of it say. etc. 

If I am forced to produce a deep syntactic analysis of the sentence, there are various ways that I could do it. All of these ways would, though, abstract away from linear order in the tree. Here's one possibility: 

The form my book is preferred if there is no reason for another determiner to appear. In that book of mine, the necessity for the demonstrative determiner to appear forces the appearance of the "genitive" form of mine, since English generally allows just a single determiner to introduce a noun phrase. German has antiquated forms of the genitive pronoun (meiner 'of mine', deiner 'of yours', seiner 'of his', ihrer 'of hers', unsrer 'of ours', eurer 'of yours', Ihrer 'of yours'). These forms have basically died out of the modern language, but they can be found on occassion in older texts. When these pronouns appeared, they would usually follow the noun that they modify, e.g. das Buch meiner 'the book of mine'. There was thus a difference in word order that helped distinguish between the genitive pronoun meiner (of mine), which followed the noun, and the possessive determiner mein- (my), which precedes the noun. I'm not sure I understand Manjusri's answer, but perhaps Icelandic is similar to German insofar as the genitive pronoun (not the possessive determiner!) appears rarely, and check to see if it follows its noun as opposed to preceding it. 

As Ivan writes, the example in the question is indeed an example of so-called right node raising (RNR). I can provide some more background information about the phenomenon. First, note the term itself (i.e. right node raising) is due to Postal (1974), and it indicates the analysis he proposed at that time. He assumed that in canonical cases of RNR, e.g. [You like] but [I dislike] the cheese, that at deep structure, two complete clauses are coordinated. The material that ends up being shared to the right is raised out of both clauses and attached to S as an adjunct would be, but only one of them is realized; the other is deleted. Many linguists who have studied the phenomenon (including myself) reject Postal's analysis, but the terminology that Postal employed remains. There is no consensus about the best analysis of the phenomenon. What this means for your example is that you have some freedom to posit a parse that you believe fits your understanding of syntax best. The Wikipedia article that Ivan linked to ($URL$ gives three possible theoretical accounts; you might choose the one that you think is best. The actual example you produce is noteworthy. It is noteworthy because it involves RNR at the level of NPs, as opposed to at the level of the clause. RNR can occur at the various levels of syntactic structure, e.g. at the level of PPs, at the level of VPs, at the level of NPs, etc. What makes all examples of RNR interesting is that the coordinated strings, i.e. the conjuncts, do not appear to be constituents. My preferred analysis is to assume small conjuncts:
