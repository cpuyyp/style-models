That is precisely what the question is asking. It is just restating it another way. Taking out all the lies, however, in the context or pure logic results in a tautology—something necessarily "true" by virtue or form. I guess the philosophic answer depends largely on your definition of "truth". I lean towards the idea that lies are the twisting of truth, and not the other way around. A distinction I make with an analogy. Truth is like pure water. Lies are everything else in the same bottle trying to blend in. 

If you're looking for something a little easier to read, I've found Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos to be a good balance of informative, entertaining, and understandable. 

Most philosophy begins with a question. I'm wondering why certain questions provoke more profound thoughts than others. What characteristics do good questions share with each other? How can we go about finding worthy problems to seek solving? For example, questions of ontology have led to much stimulating thought: What exists? How did it come to be? What does it mean to be? Questions about the nature of the universe have led to great advances in scientific thought: Does this phenomena happen every time? Under what conditions would this hold? Is this possible? Socratic questioning has brought us to the depths of the human soul, enabling us to examine the complex nature of the human mind and glean otherwise elusive truths: What makes you say that? Could you explain further? But what about...? In the perennial book How to Solve It, mathematician George Pólya, lays out a framework for solving problems by a series of progressively penetrating questions: 

The credibility factor goes up asymptotically towards 1 as time increases. This is due to the lack of evidence that disproves the proposition (rather than the lack of evidence that proves it). Since the value is 0.7 at t = 100 (1x10^2), I would guess that at t = 1x10^12, the value would be very close to 1! 

Although consciousness "implies" intentionality, the reverse is not necessarily valid. A more "stringent" definition of consciousness would be, the capability and ability to make choices! Before making a choice, the subject matter may be evaluated and compared (or not), and a choice made (good or bad). With this requirement, a plant following the sun would not be conscious because it cannot choose to not follow the sun. With regard to evolution, it is correct to regard it as entirely unintentional. Evolution is a process, and as such, it is incapable of consciousness (intent). 

If there is no such symbol, one can be easily created by "inversion" of the existing symbol. If skeptical consequence is sc, then credulous consequence would be,-sc. Or contact the "entity" responsible for the creation and standardization of symbols and request/propose the creation of such symbol. 

You will, between you, confirm that 2 is a prime number. *: : By my definition 2x1 and 1x2 are 1-dimensional lines, not rectangles, and maps to our other definition of 'only divisible by 1 and itself'. If you think these are rectangles, you could add "... rectangle with both sides > 1 to the definition" 

The problem you're having with that statement is that it's ambiguous. I suggest the follow two possible interpretations of your statement, one of which is impossible, one is completely valid. I believe to understand it, you need to specify which meaning you mean. 

Mr. Black is committing the fallacy of over-generalisation. Because it is clear that there are some claims that must be 'accepted' without evidence. Otherwise Mr. Black must deny all the axioms of mathematics and science. There is no evidence that always equals . There is no evidence that if . These are Axioms that we take to be true without evidence. 

To be able to answer the question, I have to start by defining what "free-will" is. My definition is: the freedom to change(or not), select(or not), any and all decisions. Without free-will, the ability to "change your mind" would not be possible. So, to answer your question, what free-will gives someone, is the ability to change their mind. 

There is such a thing as "synergy," were the total is greater than the sum of its parts. I think that reasoning is what "allows/causes" the synergy. Thus, reasoning also creates knowledge. So you have observation, experimentation, and reasoning, as the sources of knowledge. 

The paradox comes about because there are several statements that are not true. Lets start by examining each, one at a time: 1- In order to move, a body needs emptiness (void, space); true. 2- Emptiness (void, space) is what "exists," that has no properties and doesn't manifest itself in any way; false, (it has length, we can see and feel emptiness (void,space). 3- If emptiness exists, then it can not be known; false, (it can be seen and felt). 4- Because it is nothing; false, it is something, it contains (itself, void, space). 5- Hence, emptiness is something existing, and at the same time not existing; false, second part of statement is false. Thus, the assumption that a body needs emptiness (void,space) to move, does not lead to a paradox. 

I can say something without thinking it, just as I can think something without saying it. Therefore, I'd argue that "I think" is not implied in all language statements, but rather, "I say", "I state" or "I assert". From that perspective, the paradox resolves itself. 

There is a big jump from "is the absence of something" to "doesn't exist." I think most of the responses here, taken from the English stackexchange, were more focused on the language of it than the logic of it. For example, @chaos, 

Well, I think the question is, does the very act of shooting a man make you culpable for his death, or are you only responsible for the way your act has changed the outcome? That is, are you culpable for any exercise of free will, or are you simply culpable for the consequences of your actions? I lean towards the former. That is, the act itself is wrongdoing, not just its consequence. 

In order to come up with the "most useful" boundary on the definition of "thinking," a committee (as large as possible) should get together and 1)put forth their individual definitions of how "broad" the definition of "thinking" should be, and 2)obtain the best definition that includes as many of the definitions that are in "close" agreement with each other. In other words, the most useful boundary definition, is the one that is used the most, or by the largest group of people! 

Upon analyzing the determinism dilemma, I find that one part is false (or incomplete). I agree that all actions are either determined, or undetermined. For the determined actions, "free will" is not present. However, for the undetermined actions, there are at least two types, random and selected. Also, for the random actions, "free will"is not present. But for the selected actions, "free will" is present. This results from the application of "free will" by the selector! 

*at this point, we're transcending things entirely and starting to talk about general facts. If we only cared about the objects in the universe, this would not be 'part of the universe' Wittgenstein also is talks a lot about hypothetical facts 

Have a friend sit on the other side of a curtain with a box of tokens. have them pick a number of tokens (x) but not tell you how many they have picked. Ask them if they can form a rectangle with those tokens. Repeat the experiment, ensuring that at some point they choose 2 tokens 

You're missing information on whether or not A AND C is representative of A and representative of B. I.e. it could be that A AND C represents 49% of A, and 49% of C, and that NONE of them are B. Let's try an example: 

We could classify AI in an infinite number of other ways; some based on outcome, others based on how it works on a technical level. Here are some examples: Strong and Weak AI Your first 'School' of AI is probably Artificial general intelligence "(AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies." This is also known as Strong AI. Your second 'school' of AI is known as a 'Expert Systems' which are defined as a system designed to emulate the decision making of a human expert in a specific domain. For instance, Deep Blue, the famous chess 'AI' is an Expert System in the domain of Chess; it emulates the decisions of human Chess experts. this is also known as Weak AI, and Narrow AI. In this system, we are defining AI based on whether or not it possesses human-like cognitive abilities. Communication Ability You could classify AI into groups of those that can pass the Turing Test and those that cannot. One isn't necessarily better than the other; i.e. just because something does not communicate to humans doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. What 'Type' of 'Mind' it has You can classify AI into what I would describe as what 'type' of 'mind' it has: 

I think you are asking two separate questions here. First, is it ethical to be proud of one's country? And second, can you be proud of something that you did not create? The first, as others have mentioned, is dependent on what you use to define your ethics. In most ethical systems, to have pride in (which is different from being possessed by hubris) is amoral. If a country is doing something which is ethical, then it is good to be pleased in that country. If a country is doing something unethical, then it is good to be ashamed of it. Most of the time a country, because it is made up of people, is like a person, and is in a much more complicated situation than merely being one or the other. The second is an entirely different question. You can be proud of things you do not create, but are a part of. I am a part of my family. I like being a part of my family, and am proud of them for their accomplishments. I may have influenced the way my family is, but I did not create my family. I was merely given the opportunity to be part of it. The same for a club, or a college, or a community. A country is just much larger, and you are a much smaller part of it. But you can still be proud of this collective identity if you so choose, and the ethics of that seem mostly irrelevant to most ethical systems. In general, however, I do not believe that most people who are proud of their country are applying the kinds of critical analysis that they would of other things. Because a country is such an abstract notion, and a person's idea of something can stray so far from the actual reality of it, I think many people end up with a harmful, blind, and unconditional approval of one's country despite all evidence to the contrary. Like recurring domestic violence between a husband and wife, where one or the other is unable to admit the fault or wrongdoing of the other. People tend to think it is wrong to apply value judgments to something they love, but that kind of detached, uncritical sense of loyalty actually turns out to do more harm than good. 

Almost all scientific theories are taken 'for granted' we don't have to re-test them every time we come to a conclusion that relies upon them being true. I.e. if I want to test whether Ball A is bouncier than Ball B, I assume that the laws of motion apply equally to both balls, and that acceleration due to gravity is the same for both, etc.. 

i.e. if you had two stones, you cannot arrange them into rows and columns to form a rectangle; therefore two is a prime number. Unless you can find a way to make 2 stones form a rectangle, it is a prime number. We can use this to address the 'philosophy' aspect of your question, you are effectively attacking the 'divisible by other numbers' aspect of your definition of prime, however my definition dispenses entirely with the concept of dividing by anything, and still gives us a complete list of 'prime numbers' which includes '2'. Even in a theoretical universe where the number of numbers less than x is indeterminable (i.e. there may or may not be numbers less than x) it is still possible to independently verify whether or not x is prime using this method, therefore the 'primeness' of 2 can be verified regardless of the fact there are no whole numbers between 1 and 2 In fact, we can prove this is in our own mundane universe with an experiment: 

The short answer, is that double negation is not valid for all logic implementations. For example, although it is true/valid for Boolean logic, it is not true/valid for Intuitionistic Logic. Therefore, intuitionists are justified in rejecting double negation, as valid. 

No, there is no contradiction! However, since you make several statements, I will address/answered each one separately. 1) God is timeless - this is true because, although God is multi-dimensional, time is not one of His dimensions. 2) He exists outside spacetime - this is "sort of" true, but it would be more accurate to say that spacetime exist "inside" God. 3) Where there is no time, there is no change - this is not true! Movement/change in four-dimensional space, does not require time! 4) In order to create the Universe, God would have to have an impulse, the will to create it. This, and the very act of creating, is change - whether God has an "impulse" or not, and whether He acts or not, makes no difference because whatever He does, takes Him no time to do it (per responses 1 & 3)! In conclusion, there is no contradiction because "time" is not applicable to God. 

Your confidence in h1 will increase as you discover A that are B (and fail to discover any A that are not B) Your confidence in h2 will increase as you approach time t and fail to observe any A that are not B You may never observe any evidence of A becoming not B before t, so, in the absence of evidence, your confidence in h3 remains the same. 

Although we take these things to granted, we do allow for them to be disproved or to proved to be lacking; if new evidence arises that does so; but we may not seek that evidence out. Many of these theories are proven 'beyond reasonable doubt' but may never be proved to be 'absolutely true' 

We also have 'Axioms' in science, like we do in mathematics. Some of these 'Basic Assumptions' are things like "There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us", "Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes.", and "There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world."
