The answer is "sure". You have a given capacity - based on training - to buffer lactic acid out of your system. To do so requires oxygen. If you are running at a rate that generates lactic acid faster than you can buffer it out, you will accumulate it, and after a while, you'll have to slow down. When your aerobic system cleans up enough of the lactic acid, you'll be able to exercise again. 

600-700 grams of weight loss isn't anything to be concerned about; you can easily make it up after the workout. You could go with glucose, though you don't need to replace calories for that short of a workout. If you want to replenish more water, I'd recommend something with electrolytes in it. That will allow you to absorb the water more quickly. 

No, there is not a good way to get an estimate of how much you burn. Most machine estimates aren't very good, and they tend to be overly optimistic. The only decent way to calculate energy burn is on a bicycle with a power meter, which is actually measuring the work that you are doing directly. And no, it doesn't really matter if you are doing intervals. 

The bigger the muscles you are using - and the more of them you are using - the quicker you can get your heart rate up. That generally means using your leg muscles, and using them to move your body weight up and down. For me, something like deep squat jumps or running stairs are the ticket. 

JohnP gave a good explanation of the calculations involved. Note that wattages and calories on exercise equipment are generally inflated, and often inflated significantly. 200 watts/hour is a pretty hard effort; I ride about 3000 miles/year, and my best hour effort for last year was about 215 watts. 

I'm a ski instructor who is working on similar things. I picked up a copy of "Total Skiing" by Chris Fellows, and it has a lot of useful information. Specifically, it has a set of evaluations for physical strength and balance, and then a set of exercises to work on for each of the areas. 

Most people don't really need any calorie replacement after workouts, and if you are trying to lose weight, it would go against maintaining a deficit. If you are really hungry a day after a workout, you could eat a little more that day. Exceptions - If you are working out hard - and by hard I mean a long workout where you are working hard (say, 800 real calories or perhaps 1200 my most gym machines) - then a replacement drink to refill your glycogen stores is a good idea. You aren't working that hard, so I wouldn't bother. 

You get better because you put training stress on your system - that is what causes the adaptation. Initially, pretty much everything you do causes training stress, so you get better, but if you keep running at the same intensity, you will plateau. Which may be fine if that's where you want to be. If you want to continue to improve, however, you need what is known as specificity, which involves workouts that are shorter but targeted at improving specific things. So, when you reach a certain point, not only does high intensity work benefit your overall speed, it's really the only way to keep improving. There are numerous different approaches to doing this, from structured programs like specific intervals to informal ones like fartlek. I suggest finding a good running forum and asking there. 

The health benefits from being active are just too big to ignore; not only will you feel better, but you will age slower than those who are more sedentary. I would recommend against jogging; it can be hard on the joints, especially for those with some extra weight, but more importantly, it's hard to do, and the harder the activity is, the more likely you are to stop doing it. Walking is simple to do, requires no equipment, and can be done anywhere. Cycling is also a good choice, though I'd recommend walking first. I'd start with just doing that, and perhaps paying a bit more attention on your diet. Over time, you'll be able to walk farther and faster. I'd keep this up for a month or so. Once you are used to that, I'd look at some weight training; those who do cardio and weight training have considerably more success at losing weight than those who just do cardio. I don't know anything about freeletics, but a quick look suggests that it might be a reasonable next step. Good luck. Oh, one more thought. If you're a console gamer, some of the Kinect games on the Xbox 360 or Xbox One can be a nice way to get a little physical activity. 

I'm also going to assume that you are healthy and cleared for intense activity. If you are wanting to increase your anaerobic fitness, you are going to need to do intervals. In this case, I'd recommend all-out intervals; they will place a significant load on your system, and that will cause you to improve. I'd recommend starting with simple sprints twice a week; go out and warm up thoroughly, find a good spot, and then run as hard as you can for about 30 seconds. Recover for 3 minutes, and then repeat. When you can no longer work at the same rate, you're done with the session. Typically, this would be 4-6 efforts; if you hit 6 and still feel okay, you need to up the intensity or add a second set after a 10 minute recovery. A few keys to having success. First off, if you are running, the sprinting will put a big load on your muscles and you could get overuse. Good shoes and a good running surface will help. Second, intervals work because you can put a large load on your system, and to do so, you must be well-recovered. Make sure you take a few days off between your sessions, and if you can't put out a good effort early in the interval set, abort the session. I would not do intervals more than twice a week, and that may even be too much. Pay attention to your body. I would not do full sets the week of the event, but it's okay to do 1-2. If you do these right, they will make a significant difference in both your aerobic and anaerobic fitness. I am a fan of weightlifting in general, but starting a lifting program right before an important skill competition isn't a good idea. You could injure yourself, and even if you don't, you may end up with strangely tired muscles that throw off your timing. For the weight part, I'd concentrate on good nutrition. Intervals are going to be taking a lot out of you, and if you try to lose weight at the same time, you could go too far.
