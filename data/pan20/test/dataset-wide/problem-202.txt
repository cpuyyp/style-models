Don't fixate on the USB stick. It's a known technology with known limitations; it won't age well. Nobody has implanted neural link in their head yet so as standards progress over time the brain computer interface will look nothing like USB. Also the human brain won't fit on current portable storage devices. Even with shortcuts and good compression you'd need a shipping container full of drives using current storage tech.(not to mention the computers to run them). BUT storage density is increasing at a phenomenal rate so it's easy to imagine a future with some very dense storage technologies (maybe 3D optical storage on the myriad internal facets of a crystal --or even more radical single bit single atom techniques) AND Another limitation is that we currently have no idea how the brain stores data. We don't know the encoding language, we haven't located the storage locations, we have no idea how to read or write to the brain, but we'll figure it out if we don't kill ourselves first. Neural interfaces will be invented, after which some reckless souls will implant them. These would be easy prey. Malicious AI could also invent a method for a rapid, forced neural link. (though the process would almost certainly be painful, invasive and potentially damaging to the host). I can't imagine being able to do it without long tendrils snaking throughout the brain (the brain has no convenient bus or central architecture to plug into). So a forced neural link might look like a metallic squid that snakes around the skull and embeds deep in the brain. In traditional copying the original data persists. That's actually kind of required to get a perfect copy. But we have no idea how a neural link will function. Maybe it can only copy circuits after they've been activated. (you re-experience your life in moments as the AI forcefully activates every circuit in your head) Maybe a rapid copy literally burns out the circuits as it copies them (look up a video of a lightbulb with the glass broken off of it, it lights up bright and burns out in a puff of smoke), destroying each section of the brain as it copies it. Maybe the AI only needs the personality so the personality, memories, hopes and dreams get burnt out and a drooling husk remains. You can basically have it work any way you like since it hasn't been invented yet and we have no idea how it will work. 

It might be interesting to engage with a theologian's mindset. For fun you can dial the piety up or down as the circumstances require. There is a strong tradition of rationalizing a god's tolerance of evil. 

Use exactly the same language that religious people currently use to explain their theism in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 

What if some of the concepts were present already? Charles Babbage is credited with inventing the first computer long before the technology existed to make an electronic computer. He died in 1871 still working on his general purpose computing engine, but his work popularized the ideas of computing and formed the foundation of knowledge necessary to understand (and ultimately create) electronic computers. It's quite possible that similar thinking would have been going on in the magical world as well. Magicians would clearly need to understand energy flow. The next step towards a computer is thinking of energy as holding state and representing information and then the idea of combining different flows logically to create and store desired information states. These are concepts you could easily imagine being present in a magical universe if they were important for advanced magic, or were being worked on in theoretical circles. The third leap of insight and the one that takes us to the idea of a magical computer is: what if I could chain a bunch of these systems together and do advanced calculations, store arbitrary information etc. If your goal is a plausible way to import computation to your magical world, pick some of these concepts and add them to your world. It would still be hard to reverse engineer a computer though. One of the barriers would be how advanced and compact it is. Reverse engineering a simple logic circuit like this adder would be trivial. Pump some magical energy in one end and watch the effects, but the adder(s) in your computer have been shrunk to the size of a human hair and is sandwiched in layers of silicon. It's hard to conceptualize things at that scale. It would be far easier to reverse-engineer something out of a computer history museum, a child's toy (walking, talking robot?) or something designed to teach the fundamentals of computing. A college notebook containing an undergraduate's computer architecture homework would be sufficient to kickstart a computing revolution in a magical world. A simple computer like a Raspberry Pi or an arduino might do (It certainly would if it also included the book). 

The state of the art for subs is stealth. You can't hit what you can't see. When sneaking around everyone uses passive sonar since active sonar lights everyone up equally. The idea is that you need to minimize cavitation, that's what happens when the spinning prop blade (which has a shorter radius near the center) creates a density differential in the water and forms a bubble. The resulting bubble collapses making noise. Minimize that and you're good. It works better at slow speed, but you can kind of tune your prop for the speed you want. The process is well known, but solving the problem requires lots of number crunching and some good understanding of fluid flows. Then one day one of the major powers had this break though in out-of-the-box thinking. Stealth is only part of the battle. When things get heated, everybody lights up active sonar, bathes the battlefield in light so to speak. At this point you want to fire the fastest weapons you can. So instead of making a slow quiet torpedo, they made the fastest they could. They put the prop on the front, they maximized cavitation and put a rocket on the back end of it. The little guy swims in a pocket of air and travels like a bat out of hell. Meanwhile the other side worked hard on quiet torpedoes. In a situation with multiple sources of active sonar and rocket powered torpedoes/torpedo killers, I'm not sure a stealth torpedo is actually going to win any battles. 

All you need is for the hull to remain intact throughout the crash. That's relatively easy even if the antigravity drive is marginally functional. I'd probably assume the crew is all dead prior to the crash and the automatic systems are all fluttering on the point of failure. The craft won't have any interesting aerodynamic properties (wouldn't need it with antigrav) so it'll fly like a brick when antigrav is off. But even being active for a few moments during descent could preserve the hull. A space ship's core function is to provide a stable environment inside, regardless of extreme conditions outside. Even without active environmental controls a buried ship's atmosphere would remain stable basically indefinitely. (As long as the aliens solved the pesky problem of rubber, if not you've got a hundred years tops before all the air seals fail -- even then if it's buried in a sand dune, by then you might be protected enough for the cores to survive) Crashing in an arid climate would solve the problem of the hull rusting through, but honestly so would building the craft out of non-reactive metals. Aluminum springs to mind since aluminum oxide forms a super strong clear coat which protects the underlying metal quite nicely. Titanium is nice and strong (though brittle) and benefits from being very light. Not that you need to worry about that since you have antigrav. I would go ahead and assume that an advanced alien race would combine metals into very interesting alloys. Metals which were light and strong, non reactive etc. Consider stainless steel, it wasn't till the industrial revolution that it was commonly available. Compared to cast iron it's a super metal, but really it's just a minor tweak. An advanced civilization will have thousands of such tweaks. Transparent, ultra strong ruby glass, metals which are light and strong, non-reactive radiation proof. (we're starting to be able to make all of the above) Soil accumulation will be different in different environments. The Sahara for example has very low soil accumulation. There's basically a set amount of sand and it moves around. Other deserts have higher soil accumulation due to soil deposits from the surrounding environment. This book looks cool.

Complicated mechanical equipment degrades with startling speed. A car that has been sitting in a garage for as little as six months probably won't start. After five years, the work of a day can get it back on the road (assuming good tools, fresh fluids, fresh fuel, new batteries, available replacement parts). After a fifty years in a field in a wet climate, cars become an unrecognizable pile of rusted metal. (but aluminum is different) Hangers are usually just a thin metal shell over steel supports. It's unlikely a structure like that would survive a thousand years in a moist climate. I'd expect a normal hangar to be completely erased after a few hundred years in a jungle-like climate. If you're interested in the process of decay here's a bit about the degradation: (shortening the timeframe to 5 years when things start to become problematic) 

Cyclical fertility It's hard to convince intelligent creatures to reproduce for purely rational reasons. More power and autonomy will only exacerbate the problem. Continual reproductive impulse causes undesirable overpopulation. But cyclical fertility could solve the problem nicely. When things are stable and normal there could be no reproduction for thousands of years. A fertility cycle could initiate a period of reproduction. Preventing extinction and stagnation. This also also allows for feedback loops which allow circumstances to influence fertility rates. Catastrophic event kills off half the population? Increased duration and frequency of fertility cycles. Stable population? Reduced duration of fertility cycles and an increase in the pause between cycles. 

(edited) Upon further consideration, it's quite unlikely that our style of biology would work for a space whale (carbon based with liquid water featuring prominently). I can't even imagine a made-up biology that would work in space. Tardigrades can "survive" but they dry out and suspend all life so maybe it'd be better described as coming back to life. Some of the challenges surrounding space biology: zero atmospheric pressure, super high radiative heat loss, no protection from solar and cosmic radiation, no free mass floating around to build biology mass, and the only free energy is light. Maybe they gestate in a mass and energy rich environment such as nebulae, but even solving the mass problem I can't imagine the biology. Honestly the easiest path forward might be a multi-dimensional creature which somehow has access to an environment and materials that we're not aware of. Where does it get the mass and energy necessary to support life? From someplace we are not equipped to see or touch, (but maybe we can start looking there now that we know about it). How does it move across interstellar distances given the speed of light and the lack of free energy between solar systems? Maybe it's not always entirely present in our universe. As for what the authorities would do with a thousand tons of alien biology, I would hope that samples would be made freely available for scientific study. There's no rational reason to maintain secrecy and openness really helps scientific progress by creating a distributed non-blocking system. Then again secrecy seems to be engrained in governments so perhaps the finders would try to keep it secret (good luck given the size) 

This question should probably be rephrased for greater scientific accuracy, but the core is good. Perhaps the question could be rephrased as: 

Reduce the number and weight of things you need to launch: Raw materials food water/air Sustainability: Ultimately you'll want to bootstrap mining and manufacture in space. (this is probably the point when you know you can colonize the solar system) Sustaining life Food production in space Water harvesting in space Waypoints would really help (imagine how boring the martian had been if there had been a habitable terrarium and emergency shuttle in orbit before anyone went down to the surface)
