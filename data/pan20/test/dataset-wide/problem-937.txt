from P.W. Livermore et al. 2013 Finally a cross section (image above) of the asymmetric flow (off dipole) clearly shows opposite direction in the outer core and inner core (blue vs red on the color bar). So, in summary: 

While this does not directly answer the question, these two ideas are relevant: Rare Earth hypothesis and Mediocrity principle. More focused to the question, This letter to nature discusses the purposed link between evolution/mutation rate during of life and magnetic pole reversal periods. You see, when the magnetic fields reversed, it widely thought that it occurs over a period on the order of 1 - 10,000 years. During this reversal, the intensity of the magnetic field degrades to 0, and then increases from there in a reversed polarity. It is not a contentious position that during these field reversals the mutation rate (not sure about speciation rate) dramatically increases. 

David Salzberg and Margret Marshall suggest that using green receiver functions (which might make more sense given how we determine the difference between explosions and earthquakes) can locate a detonation in North Korea with up to 0.5 km accuracy. I am assuming that IRIS data sets carry enough information to make receiver functions, as I think triangulation may require a much larger event than a single nuclear warhead (not sure about this point) to be very accurate. For a little background on how we determine if an event is a explosion or an earthquake (I know this isn't part of the question, but still useful for others) we look at "beachball" diagrams(from csegrecorder.com): 

I am afraid that you aren't being specific enough to really answer your question: What about mountain chians valleys and hills are you interested in? There are simple and complex models dating back from the 1960s to present. Are you interested in learning about the material properties of the crust, or just topography in general? What about weathering effects? What about the flow laws that govern the lower and middle crust (depending on who you talk to). I would look into the field of dynamic topography and how that is calculated. Two books that I think might be useful to read are Fowler and Tourcotte and Schubert, they will help give you an overview of geodynamics as a field, and what engineering solutions we apply to Earth. In the 1-D and 2-D flow sections there is much about the crust. A good starting paper might be Bird 1991 (sorry, its probably behind a pay wall, but I couldn't find an open pdf on it). As far as codes (and consquently mathematics) The two sections of CIG I would look at are S-T Dynamics and Mantle Convection. I am sorry I couldn't provide a comprehensive answer, but I think the sources I've linked may give you a good start and thinking about this problem. 

While I don't know the specifics of ocean modeling, unless there there is a "standard" in which nodes are organized and written (Ie X,Y,Z), there will always be coding required. Furthermore, the way a a data file is written always depends on how tasks in the model are delegated to the processor: Is the model designed to be run on a personal PC or a Beowulf Cluster? You might be able to use something such as OpenDx, to compare ocean modeling results, though I still think that a quick python script would be in order to properly format all data types. 

This is a very good question, not just important to seismic inversion, but also modeling in general. Lets set this problem up differently. Lets say point's A and D are nodes. 

I was thinking about this question, which may turn out to be simple, about climate dynamics: How does the amount of mass in an atmosphere affect the seasonal changes and dynamics of the planet's climate? For example, while I know there are seasons on Mars, there surely isn't as stark of shift between seasons like Earth for example. Perhaps the amount of mass in the atmosphere really isn't a controlling variable? Perhaps composition or even distance to external heat sources is more important? 

Almost all finite methods that use forward time models adhere to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy law which calculates a courant number and compares it to a $C_{max}$, which is what determines stability, so for 2-D: $$C = \frac {V_xdt}{dx} + \frac{V_ydt}{dy} \ge C_{max}$$ Where $C$ is the courant number, $V_i$ is the velocity in subscripted direction, $dx$ or $dy$ is the length interval in specified direction and $dt$ is the specified time step. If you are getting numerical instability, increasing the mesh spacing will lower the courant number, but then you might be missing the dynamics you want to capture. If you decrease the time step, it will take longer for the dynamics to develop computationally. One way to solve this computational problem is to code in a dynamic time step: Keep calculating the $C$ and $C_{max}$. If $C > C_{max}$, then have the model lower the step by half. Check again, then reset for the next step so you can have larger timesteps for "less dynamic" times. I have implemented this many times in other models and it has worked well. Another possibility might be that you have high aspect ratios in your mesh: if your $x$ direction is 10 km and your $y$ is 1 km, a $10:1$ aspect ratio is very high. In your case, since the model package you use are triangles, you want the angles in the triangle grid to be as acute as possible. Obtuse angles would mean high aspect ration, in general. Like llmari, I am not familiar with hydrodynamic models, so I do not do specifics. My expertise are in both mantle convection and plate flexure models. I hope this helps. 

The answer is that there are more forces than just the momentum of the earth at play. The electromagnetic force generated by the core is pushing on itself, in fact: 

In addition to Joe Kington's excellent answer; there is also a more complex process going on in the pacific northwest. As described in Nature, the origin of Columbia River Basalts is caused by the rupture of the of the subducted Farallon slab. The intense mantle flow weakened the slab to the point that the end decoupled from the "main" tectonic plate. The decoupled lithosphere is left to "sink" into the mantle without constraints from surface boundary conditions (kinematic) pushing hot mantle up under the pacific northwest. The pushing of this hot mantle provides an uncommonly abundant source of meltable mantle, resulting in increased volcanism. 

As a non-oceanographer, I might approach this from a continuity standpoint. The sum of the fluxes in each direction must equal 0 (conservation of mass, basically). So you might have some measurements in the x and y directions, which could then give you at least an estimate of the vertical velocities in a given water column, assuming uniform lateral and vertical compositions. There are more assumptions you'd have to make, such as what is a reasonable water column size, that I am not privy too. While I wouldn't use this in a scientific paper, I'd bet it would be a good enough initial calculation to see if some question is worth doing a more accurate method. Just an idea... definitely not a definitive answer. 

Unless they are large or famous earthquakes, I doubt you will find the waveforms for specific earthquakes. What you will find is a ton of seismic data: $URL$ which you can request. Once you have requested (downloaded ect) the waveforms (probably in seed format) you will need to analyze the waveforms themselves to find specific earthquakes (request data from a time when you know there was an earthquake) and find the p/s/love ect wave yourself on the seismogram. To read seed data, you can either find a matlab code or write your own! (Im sure there is a python equivalent at this point.)
