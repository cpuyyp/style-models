This requirement is wrong. What will happen in the future depends on what knowledge we will have in the future. If we knew what knowledge we will have in the future we would already have it, and we don't. So predicting future states of affairs is impossible in problems where people are involved. You ask for a demarcation criterion between rational and irrational ideas. It is possible for a person to adopt an idea that stops the correction of errors in some or all of his ideas. One example of this is not holding claims to make predictions to a high enough standard. People who think astrology is valid are making this mistake since its predictions are either vague, or rely on information supplied by the person for whom the prediction is being made. You might want to read "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch for more on the issues raised by this question. 

I think the core of the problem is this. Consider some piece of knowledge Y that enables you to tell whether any purported piece of knowledge X is actually knowledge. The problem would then be: can you use Y to identify whether Y is knowledge? The way out of this problem is to realise that it is misconceived for at least two distinct reasons. First, a criterion is basically a definition. A definition is a way of summarising an uncontroversial piece of knowledge so you can easily refer to it. A definition can't fulfil the role often assigned to it of allowing us to settle substantive using a dictionary because every definition uses undefined terms. So a definition always has some wiggle room for drawing different conclusions from it. So trying to settle whether some alleged item of knowledge is knowledge by appealing to a criterion is bound to fail. There is another reason why trying to settle issues by definitions is an extremely bad habit. A definition is only useful in the light of an explanation. Any remotely interesting explanation will have lots of unanticipated consequences that will require the definition of new terms to make discussion easier. But those definitions will only make sense if you understand the underlying explanation. Trying to discuss a definition in isolation is a recipe for confusion. Second, the whole idea of the criterion presupposes that at some point you're going to have a closed set of rules for when something is knowledge. But if that is true, any unsolved problems written into the criterion can never be solved even in principle. Anything not included in the criterion is not knowledge and so the solution to any problem in the criterion is not knowledge. Knowledge consists of solutions to problems. You create knowledge by noticing a problem, proposing solutions to it and then criticising the solutions until only one is left. There is no reason to think there is any criterion, and no call for one. For a better understanding of epistemology see "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Popper, Chapter I. 

There is a substantial amount of material about creating knowledge in general in some recent writing with philosophical content. Creating knowledge requires generating variations on current knowledge and then selecting among them. The selection can take the form of adopting ideas. But you can also select ideas by refusing to provide material support to people advocating such ideas. So the best way to ensure that disadvantaged people can affect philosophy is to allow them to critically discuss any idea they like, and to deny material support to people whose ideas they disagree with. Denying material support to academic philosophers is not really an option at the moment since they are funded by tax money. Universities get grants, many of them from the government, and put some of that money toward philosophy. You can't refuse to pay the taxes for this activity without being fined, going to prison and that sort of thing. So one way to make it possible for disadvantaged people to affect the philosophy is done would be to abolish all government funding of universities. This is part of the more general insight that poor people benefit from free markets, not from government control of the economy. See "Capitalism" by George Reisman for more explanation. Since philosophers are not advocating this, they have not done everything possible to allow disadvantaged people to correct them. 

You seem to be confused about the distinction between two different tasks you might perform with a computer. You can take some set of bits B with value V(B) as input to a computation and compute some function of those bits F(V(B)). The function F is a rule that maps any specific sequence V(B) to some specific value of those bits. Any computer that obeys the laws of physics is limited to computing only the set of functions that a Turing machine could compute. Not all of the patterns of information flow that can take place in reality fit the pattern of being a function of a set of bits with specific values. A quantum system is best described by a set of Heisenberg picture observables. For a system prepared in a particular way, some of its observables may be sharp - that is, every system prepared that way gives you the same result when you measure that observable. But in general not all of the observables can have that property. If one observable of the system is sharp, others will not be sharp. There are processes that can take place where there is no explanation of those processes in terms of quantities that have a single value all the time. Entanglement is an example of this kind of process. There is no explanation of what is happening in the EPR experiment in which each of the systems involved has only a single value for each measurable quantity. See $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ However, it is still possible to simulate a quantum system to any degree of accuracy you like. A suitable simulation will not only give you accurate information about the probabilities of various outcomes once the process has finished, it could also give you the same information about the probabilities at stages intermediate between the initial and final state. All of that information about the probabilities gives you information about other properties of the system like relative phases. For a brief discussion with some references see $URL$ It is possible to build a device that can calculate a detailed abstract description of a quantum system, including an entangled system. People who say that quantum computation isn't real computation or something like that have an idea about what sorts of things can be calculated that is arbitrarily limited to a subset of what can be calculated in reality. 

First, an epistemological note. It is not possible to prove any position at all. That is, there is no way of showing that any position is true or probably true or anything like that. A valid argument has assumptions and some kind of rules that then show that if the premisses are true then the conclusion must be true. But there is no way of showing that an argument is valid and the premisses are correct. How would you do that? Make another argument? But that argument raises the same problem as the original argument of proving the correctness of the premisses and validity of the argument. Rather, you have to guess what premisses and arguments and arguments are correct and then criticise those guesses by considering issues like whether they are consistent with other ideas about how the world works, whether they match scientific evidence, testimony and that sort of thing. If two ideas fail to match then one of them is wrong. You don't know which of the two ideas is wrong and that requires more thinking about how to test each idea. Why do people get wrongly convicted? Because there is no way to guarantee that a person will not make a mistake. It is possible that the proven beyond reasonable doubt standard makes the situation worse because people are trying to act on the false idea that they can prove stuff, but I don't know whether that is the case. A more reasonable standard would be that if you can think of any explanation for what happened that has not been successfully criticised by the prosecution, then you should not convict. 

The laws of physics, in particular quantum physics, seem to imply that it is possible to construct a universal computer that could simulate any physical system with arbitrary accuracy, this is called the Turing Principle, see $URL$ and "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch. The relevant kind of computer is a quantum computer, not a classical computer. These laws apply to all physical systems, including everything that you can observe and your own brain. So if these laws and the argument that they imply the Turing Principle are correct then it is impossible to observe anything that contradicts the Turing Principle. There are explanations that are not entailed by the laws of physics but are nevertheless true, such as epistemological explanations. They are usually about some complex phenomenon where it is possible for complex rules to emerge that are not straightforward consequences of the laws of physics but don't contradict them. These emergent explanations can't contradict the laws of physics, because then they couldn't be instantiated in any physical object because the existence of such an object would be forbidden by the laws of physics. Even if the Turing principle is wrong these emergent explanations still could not contradict the laws of physics for that reason. 

In general, you don't have a right to medical care. If a vaccine takes a long time and a lot of money to make, then the manufacturer has to charge a lot to get his money back, so he can keep making it and maybe improve it and make it cheaper. If you want to increase availability of medical treatment there would be many ways of reducing the cost, most of which involve the government getting out of the way. See books such as "The Primal Prescription": I don't completely endorse this book since I think it endorses food fads but it illustrates a lot of the problems created by government intervention in medicine. If you're going to say the person is holding the vaccine out of meanness or whatever, then in general companies don't create medical labs on a whim and any executive who tries to use them for a whim has a high risk of being fired and/or sued. The utility monster is an illustration of the stupidity of utilitarianism, not of liberty, and it also contradicts basic economics. There isn't a measurable quantity called utility that can be compared across different people. Rather, each person ranks the means and ends available to him and if he would choose option A over option B, then we say A has more utility, but that has no meaning outside the context of an individual choice. 

Before I begin I should note that you have been given some bad advice, e.g. - read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Any second hand source in philosophy should be treated with deep suspicion. Misunderstandings are extremely common even in everyday life, and in an abstract subject such as philosophy the problem is even worse. Philosophers in general have not understood Popper at all and many accounts of his work bear almost no resemblance to the original. Historicism is the idea that it is possible and desirable and scientific to predict the course of history. Popper pointed out that this is flatly impossible in several places, e.g. - 'The Open Society and Its Enemies', 'The Poverty of Historicism' and 'The Open Universe'. What you will do at some future time is a result of the knowledge you have at that time. What knowledge you will have in the future is necessarily unpredictable because if you could predict the content of that knowledge you would already have it. So historical prediction is impossible. Institutions should be not designed to make prophecies. Rather, they should be set up to make it easy to remove bad or incompetent policies and leaders. Since Marx makes historical prophecies and has no interest in error correcting institutions as a result, he advocates bad ideas. Popper lets Marx off far too easily. I recommend 'Karl Marx and the close of his system' by Bohm-Bawerk and 'Time will run back' by Hazlitt. 

I think the solution doesn't have much to do with the intuitionistic continuum. Rather, there are two considerations. First the mere fact that a continuum can be divided arbitrarily finely doesn't imply that the appropriate measure for how long it will take to cross some particular region is infinite. Whether the time taken to cross a region is finite or not depends on what measure of time the laws of physics respect. The fact that you can imagine measuring the space in question in a different way has nothing to do with anything. Second the real laws of physics do not allow space and time to be divided arbitrarily finely. In any finite region containing a finite amount of energy, there is a finite number of possible states. That number is typically extremely large by the standards of everyday life, but it is finite: the Bekenstein bound. What changes continuously is the probability of any given state. 

The human body is a very complex machine. In principle, when it is damaged that damage can be undone provided that we know about the damage and it hasn't gone too far. At present, the technology required to do this doesn't exist. If it did, then your body could be kept alive indefinitely in a youthful state. That means there would no upper bound on how long you could live barring accidents and murder. I don't know whether you would want to call that immortality. A researcher called Aubrey de Grey has come up with an idea about how to repair age related damage before it goes too far that he calls Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS): $URL$ 

No statement of any kind can be justified by induction because induction is impossible (Section 1 of LScD): 

I don't know what the author of the book you cite means. However, induction is impossible and unnecessary as pointed out be Karl Popper, see "Realism and the Aim of Science" especially chapter I, "Objective Knowledge" by Popper chapter 1 and Chapters 3 and 7 of "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch and Chapter 1 of "The Beginning of Infinity" by Deutsch. It is impossible because an explanation, an account of how the world works, does not follow from any finite set of observations. Such an explanation has an infinite set of consequences, some of which may be unobservable. For example, our current physical theories have implications for the temperature at the core of the sun, but it may be impossible to measure that temperature. Knowledge is created by noticing a problem, proposing solutions to the problem and criticising the solutions until only one is left and it has no known criticisms. No induction is necessary to guess and criticise guesses, so no induction is necessary for progress. Alleged examples of induction are all examples of guessing and no amount of fancy terminology can change that. For example, "up to now the sun raised every morning; therefore, the sun raises every morning". Taken literally this is false. The sun often doesn't rise at the north pole. And if the Earth's orbit decays so that it falls into the sun or is ejected from the solar system it will fail. The sun rising every morning so far has nothing to do with it rising tomorrow except in the light of an explanation of why it rises: celestial mechanics or whatever. And then the explanation is doing the heavy lifting, not induction. Admitting that you've guessed an explanation and some consequences for the sun rising is the honest way to go. Saying anything else involves stupidity and/or self deception. The idea that induction can be rescued by assuming the uniformity of natural law is no good.If such a uniformity principle does nothing to explain in what respects natural laws are uniform, then it selects no specific explanation. If the principle does try to explain in what respects the laws of nature are uniform, then it is a law of nature and so can't be used as a foundation for some attempt to justify some set of laws of nature.
