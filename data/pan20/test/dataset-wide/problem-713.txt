This will always require some DIY, though. For example you could get a small cloth handlebar bag (worn+slightly dirty). Make two button holes (i.e. with the same technique, not for real buttons :) ) in the bag next to the handlebar and use a cable like this to tie it through the button holes to the handlebar with both loop ends hidden in the bag. Now you can lock something to the loop ends of the cable, for example a small lockable pouch made from strong tarpaulin (maybe reinforced by a layer of wire mesh on the outside). But from the outside it looks like any old cloth bag with at most something like a water stained map and a dented apple inside. :) Other idea: Mud stained non-translucent drinking bottle. Just leave it in the bottle-holder with your stuff inside. 

I don't know about your area, but here around it's quite common to see bikes locked up with some carrier bags attached (not locked) to them. I wouldn't ever do this because my bags are high-quality bags (water-proof, durable, etc.) which are expensive even without content. But this leads me to the following idea: Get a cheap looking bag for your bike, handlebar, saddle, rack, whereever. Then discretely lock that bag shut and to your bike. 

(in short: best solution is in the first bullet point) There are quite a lot of possibilities, as reflected by the myriad of different answers. Here is an attempt at summing them up together with my experiences with them (where available). The problem appears when there is cold wind blowing on the scrotum+perineum and when they are wet and cooled by evaporation. If you are a women who wants to warm your corresponding area: I don't think this answer is actually too gender-specific if you mentally replace any references to male body parts. Should probably work for you too. Just dressing other parts of the body warmer doesn't help. I tested this a couple of times and it really seems to be true. And it makes sense: heating the testicles (and torso in general) is a priority for the body, if that stops working then you have much bigger problems because you definitely have hypothermia. So the solutions need to be about keeping the wind away from this specific area and keeping it dry. The obvious luxury solution is the answer by Criggie: Get a fairing. This keeps the wind away and if it's good the rain too (also: speeeeeeed :). Other solutions work like an additional layer of clothing: Inner layers: 

It really depends on how big the bumps are. You might want to stay away from a full carbon bike as they are rigid and you will feel everything. You can get "Roubaix" style that are built for a bumpier ride. When you say road bike I assume you mean racing style. A tourer or hybrid may also do the job but the fastest will be a racer. 

Helmet lights are good. Usually in addition to one on the handlebars. The pro of the helmet light is that you can light up things that are not directly infront of you. The pro of having an additional light is that it increases the chance of being seen and adds extra illumination for you. The con is that if you are looking to the side and a car is coming from the front they will not see the light shining at them, so you should not have a helmet light as your only light. 

It seems silly to say I don't know how to breathe, but I don't. When doing weights, I know you exhale when you do the work part of the rep. In Yoga similarly breathe out on the stretch. Rock climbing too, when you pull yourself up breathe out. The list goes on. What on earth do I do for cycling. Is it different for riding on flats or going up hill? I am talking here about when a reasonable amount of effort is being put in, not necessarily racing or time trial but not exactly bumbling along either. I remember when I was younger and did Cross country running at school we were taught to do two short breaths in and two out. Does that apply here or is there something else. I saw watching time trials no TV that some of the riders seem to ride with their mouth wide open. I tried this and found that on hot dry days it really hurt my throat and lungs. 

I have a 2010 Specialized Tricross Sport Triple. I want to know what type and size of Bottom Bracket I need to replace the original one. Specialized's archived page for this bike lists the BB as a "BB-7420 w/crank bolts". From what I've read online, this is a British threaded, square tapered, 68mm BB. From what I've read elsewhere online, a common replacement for this is the Shimano BB-UN55, at around $15 CAD online. However, I haven't found a consensus about what length the Tricross needs. Here someone says 118mm for the 2011 Tricross; Bikepedia lists 113mm for the 2010. Is there any way to figure that out without taking the bottom bracket out to read the specs off of it? And is there any other spec beyond the threading, width, taper style, and length, that I need to ensure compatibility? Finally, if there's a better replacement than the BB-UN55, I'd be curious to know about it. I'd like to stay under $50 CAD. Thanks. 

There are lots of great answers already, I'll just throw out one more thing: you could check around for a cycling skull-cap with an SPF rating. One example is this one from Giro, rated at SPF 30. It's designed to go under a helmet for summer use, and has an SPF rating. Presumably any fabric will keep some sun off and could therefore have an SPF rating, but since this one actually provides the rating, you can compare it to sunscreens you've used to determine if it's sufficient. In my experience, SPF 30 is plenty for most conditions. I haven't used that Giro cap myself, but I did use some Pearl Izumi SPF arm "warmers" which I actually found cooler than riding without sleeves. I used them on tour, sometimes doing 6+hours in the sun without sunscreen on my arms, and never got sunburnt while using them, whereas my back would sometimes get mildly sunburnt through my wool jersey. 

Switzerland: Cycling on pedestrian facilities is forbidden unless there is a sign allowing it. There are lots of people who ignore this (both people who are uncomfortable in traffic, and people who are optimizing time at all costs, like couriers). In general this seems to be tolerated by the police, although they can make an example of anyone if they want to. 

Your braking technique is probably bad with respect to overheating. Continuing to ride could help, but only if you do periodic breaking, i.e. you don't break at all until you reach max safe speed, then you brake hard to slow maybe by 10km/h, repeat. How much speed to lose depends on slope (how fast you gain speed again) and load (how much energy is dumped into your brakes to slow the same amount). If you brake more in one go, then your brakes have more time to cool in between but your average speed is also slower. In the absolute worst case (heavily overloaded/bad brakes/too steep) you stop almost all the way and your max safe speed is also pretty low. Make sure the periods of braking are much shorter than the periods of free-rolling. If your rim brakes become too hot you risk melting the tube (or otherwise damaging the rim, but I suspect first to go would be the tube) and at least disc brakes also just stop braking at all once they are properly overheated (I can tell you from experience, this is no fun). If the above technique doesn't suffice, then it's too steep and/or there is too much load on your bike for this gradient and you must periodically stop and let the brakes cool or just walk your bike down the hill. 

In your case there are no bikeways of any kind showing: pathways, or even shared lanes (dotted lines) on the bridge: 

It's tough to give an "objective" answer to this, but I was in the same scenario 5 years ago and went with a CX bike and have no regrets. I always advise newbies to non-mountain biking (e.g. you're new to pavement commuting, road biking, racing, touring, gravel road biking, etc.) to at least consider a CX bike. Here are some thoughts: Road bikes tend to be very specifically tailored to road cycling, with lightweight (i.e. less durable components), and an aggresive (i.e. "hunched over" riding position that while great for racing is not so hot for almost all other pursuits (commuting, touring, etc.). CX bikes, at least at the entry level (think aluminum frame, carbon fork, low to mid-range components) tend to have a more upright position that's a lot easier to get used to if you're coming from mountain/hybrid bikes. They also tend to have more heavy duty components, e.g. wheels with more spokes, etc., and the aluminum frame ones will often include mounting points for racks, fenders, etc., which road bikes tend not to. As such, a CX bike can be a bit of a jack of all trades, letting you try out various types of road riding: 

Can someone tell me what this pin is doing, and was I supposed to remove it before riding the bike? If I'm not supposed to remove it, in what maintenance scenario would I ever remove it? If I was supposed to remove it, is it possible I've done damage by riding with it in place? Thanks. 

Presuming you are doing a standing start and coming to a complete stop at the top of the hill. The simple requirement is you need energy to move your from the bottom to the top. Most of the energy required will be to raise potential energy of the payload (you and the bike). Essentially you will be creating kinetic energy (moving the bike) by converting chemical energy in your body. There will be loses due to heat, friction with the road surface and air resistance. Disregarding them for the moment (they are not negligible, but complicate the calculation). Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h Where: m = mass g = gravitational acceleration h = height PE is proportional to m, so a 10% increase in mass will increase the PE by 10%. Meaning you will need 10% more kinetic energy to get to the top of the same hill. Power is work done (energy) divided by time: P = W / t Where: P = Power in watts W = work done or energy in Joules t = time to do work. If your power is constant we can rearrange the equation to get P = (m * g * h)/ t becomes: t = (m * g * h) / P so with constant power, gravity and hill height your time will increase proportional to increase in mass, given by the above equation. If there is no wind air resistance will become less relevant the slower you are going. Friction will increase due to increase in weight. The steepness of the hill is theoretically irrelevant in this calculation. You are gaining the same amount of Gravitation Potential energy when you the same mass to the same height. So it shouldn't theoretically matter whether the hill is 10% or double as long and 5%. However, as you are generating the energy you need to create it from chemical energy, and there is only so much you can generate at one time. Your muscles will become inefficient and therefore on steeper hills you may require more energy than less steep ones. So on a steeper hill wind resistance might become less relevant but power (how much energy you can put out over time) to weight ratio will become the most relevant factor. What I am trying to point out in the last paragraph is that the energy you require to put into your body and for your body to convert into forward motion is not the same as the simple kinetic energy required to get you to the top of the hill. However all things being equal a change in mass will have the same affect on the time as I stated in the equations. 

I'm curious to get some opinions on this from other cyclists. FYI this event took place in Ottawa, Canada. On my work commute, there are about 3 blocks where I ride in the lane with cars because there are no bike lanes or sharrows, and I need to make a left turn in one of two left turning lanes, onto another street which also has no bike lane, and no shoulder. Details below in photo. During that part of my commute two days ago, I stopped at a red light, in the middle of the left turn lane at the front of a line of several cars. The car behind me honked while we were still stopped, clearly wanting me to get out of his way before we'd even started moving. I stayed where I was since there was nowhere to go: another left-turning traffic lane to my left, and a straight through lane on my right that only buses can proceed through. After taking the left turn, I proceeded in the center of the lane for one block before signalling a right turn, after which I normally ride on the side of the lane because there is more space. While I was riding the block right after the left turn, the driver who had honked at me pulled into the other lane to pass, then while passing, i.e. while right next to me, quickly swerved back about halfway into my lane, coming within about one foot of me while I was riding, then back out into his own lane. This was clearly meant as a threatening maneuver to scare me. The vehicle did not make contact with me. I was able to memorize his license plate, make and model, and car color, and I took note of the exact time time, so I can certainly pinpoint who it was in a police report. So I'm wondering if it's worth reporting something like this to the police, or will that just be an exercise in frustration? If anyone has any tips or suggestions on reporting something like this, I would appreciate it. (Again, this is in Canada, so any locally relevant tips would be great)
