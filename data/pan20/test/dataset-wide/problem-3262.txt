First, Jackson was within his rights. My recollection (of a piece I read years ago) was that when Jackson's pistol misfired, it was Dickinson's second who forced Dickinson to stand for Jackson's second shot, which Jackson was allowed, under the rules. My further understanding is that both Dickinson and Jackson violated the "unwritten" rules; that in a duel, the need to preserve one's honor required one only to shoot to wound, not kill. (And even firing in the air was acceptable, especially if it was "close.") Dickinson violated that "rule" by shooting close enough to Jackson's heart to kill, and missing by a fraction of an inch. After this, Jackson was not inclined to grant Dickinson any mercy, especially since the duel was fought over Dickinson insulting Jackson's wife. But pro Dickinson people (the majority in this group of "locals"_ were understandably mad that Jackson shot to kill, even though Dickinson had done the same. 

Most jobs in those days, farm and factory work, was nearly as dangerous as the military.In the military, young men at least got a uniform, more or less enough to eat, and a place to sleep, which was more than many migrant farm or factory workers could count on. And a few were attracted by opportunities for travel and adventure and plunder. Battles were bloody when fought, but fortunately few and far between. As to training, it helped that most men of the time (other than officers) were illiterate, and could be drilled relentlessly to march and shoot without thinking, and be "numb" to the death around them. 

Strange at it may seem, there was a movement called "anti-suffragism" in the U.S. and U.K. composed mainly of women. Their numbers were small, since this posture would have been "counterintuitive." The Americans were composed mainly of "conservative" women who liked the division of duties and society between "domestic" (for women), and "outside," for men. On the other side were radicals like Emma Goldman, who favored "anarchism," instead of working within the system, through suffrage. 

To a Cuban, it looks like a "Spanish Cuban, (North) American" war. But to a (North) American, it looks like a war on several fronts against Spain, of which Cuba was one. Other battlefields included Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. To the American way of thinking, it was a transfer of Spain's (remaining) overseas empire to the rising Americans. Cuba's revolution was advanced enough for her to assert her independence from America (although this was somewhat nominal until 1959). But the others just fell into the lap of the victors, and history is usually written by the victors. From an American point of view, Cuba was what America didn't get, which is why Americans would likely omit "Cuba" from their description of the war. 

Keynes' views were widely mis-represented by his disciples, notably Joan Robinson, who was well to the left of him. Keynes was actually "orthodox" in many ways. With his emphasis on "money," he was actually closer to Milton Friedman than to the "Keynesian" doctrine he is associated with. Where he differed from "orthodoxy" was in promoting deficit-financed pump-priming policies "this one time," (the Great Depression). His more liberal disciples, like Robinson, preached that such policies should be followed "all the time" because they believed in government spending. Some of them were actually "Fabian" Socialists. 

In February 1916, the Germans might have captured the fortress of Verdun (France), quickly through an all-out assault. Instead, the German General Falkenhayn initially elected to make an artillery attack on it, without using a lot of infantry. His rationale was allegedly stated in his Christmas (1915) memo to the Kaiser (some historians dispute this), which was interpreted to mean that he wanted to attack a city of sentimental value to France, "suck in" as many French troops as he could, kill as many as possible with artillery fire, and bleed the French army to death. Capturing the fortress would be of secondary importance. The end result was that the Germans failed to capture the fortress, and inflicted French casualties at rate of only slightly more than 1- to 1 (versus a 5 to 4 overall Allied advantage), meaning a tactical defeat for Germany. In 1942, the German summer offensive (Fall Blau) started spectacularly with the capture of Voronezh on the Don by the left flank of the southern front by armored divisions. If this armor had been sent southeast to Stalingrad, supported by an eastward advance of infantry, the Germans might have captured it by late July. Instead, the Germans sent the armor from Voronezh due south for the Caucasus oil fields. This not only prevented them from using the armor to capture Stalingrad, but blocked the infantry advance of Paulus' Sixth Army. The assault on Stalingrad didn't begin until late August, giving the Soviets more time to reinforce the city. Why were the Germans so dilatory on their attack on Stalingrad? Were they trying to "suck in" Soviet reinforcements to "Stalin's city," destroy them en masse, and thereby weaken Soviet forces to the north (around Moscow) and south (the Caucasus)? 

In "A War to Be Won," historians Williamson Murray and Allan Millet reported that "Rommel was not working office hours." After marching and fighting a whole day, he bridged the Meuse during the evening and night hours, and had his division across by early morning the following day. That enabled the intrepid Heinz Guderian to reach the sea in two more days with armor (a relatively new weapon), an unheard of timetable that scared the German high command almost as much as the Allies. Similarly George Washington "crossed the Delaware" on the night of December 25, 1776, after having marched Christmas Day. He attacked and captured 1000 "Hessians" at dawn, December 26, 1776, "the morning after." America won a key battle because it had a commander who was willing to march on Christmas Day and the following night to fight the following day, and Germany won the Battle of France because Rommel as a similar commander. He deserves his fame for this, as much as for his African campaigns. Maybe "amphetamines" had something to do with it, but a lot had to do with the Germans' commander. I used an example for "pre-amphetamine" times to illustrate that fact. Edit: A commenter pointed out that the British were equally energetic to Rommel, citing then divisional commander named Montgomery,* who almost singlehandedly replaced the collapsed Belgium-held Allied left flank near the French Belgian border. That's why the British had their own miracle, at Dunkirk. So a large part of the answer was yes, the French high command was "that bad," or at least not up to the level of the others cited above. Murray and Millet made the point that the rapid defeat in the Battle of France defied all expectations, but happened nevertheless, because of the way the various interactions played out. *And it was the same Montgomery who bested Rommel in North Africa years later, albeit with superior forces. 

Many civilizations arose because they were the "optimum size" (for their time), and then fell when they ceased to be the optimum size. It's interesting that the early civilizations started in peninsulas. Such places had good water transportation, and one land connection. This basically describes Babylon, between the Tigris and Eurphrates Rivers, and the part of Egypt between the Nile and the Red Sea. India is one large (too large) peninsula, as was "China" (the part between the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers). Greece and Rome rose when they did because they were peninsulas that were optimum size for their time. Similar things could be said about England (an island), as well as Spain and France (peninsulas) in their time. The purpose of the Erie Canal was to turn the eastern United States into one large "peninsula between the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, and the Atlantic Ocean. The rise of the BRICs is occurring now because they are optimum size for OUR time. India and China, as large peninsulas, are now coming into their own. Russia and Brazil, although larger (than Chine ex the Himalays, etc.) may be similarly regarded. The only other country in the world of comparable size (more than 1 million square miles and more than 100 million people), is the United States. 

David Farragut was an aggressive commander who sometimes exceeded his orders. In 1863 near Port Hudson, for instance, he had orders to co-ordinate a naval attack with a land based attack. Farragut decided to attack first, to obtain all the glory for the navy, and was defeated when the Confederates could concentrate artillery fire on him without the distraction of a land attack. Another formative influence was the capture of New Orleans, which he had won by "going through" two enemy forts, and then destroying a large (but inferior) Confederate fleet, leaving the port at the mercy of his ships' guns. At Mobile, the Confederates had both two forts and torpedoes, but on the other hand, its fleet was much smaller than at New Orleans. Farragut coolly figured that while he had two barriers to get past, rather than one, his earlier experience had taught him that he was capable of doing this. The effect of losses such as the the one sunk ship is psychological, as much as physical. Seldom do armies or navies take losses of as much as 50 percent (except in retreat, after being broken). Farrugut figured correctly that if he could get through the torpedoes and past the forts with "some" losses, what was left would be able to defeat the few remaining Confederate ships and capture the harbor. He was right of course, and the decisive factor in such battles is often the bravery and determination of the commander. It's not a matter of Farrugut, Nelsono, or any other naval commander "knowing" he can get through. It's called "you pay your money and you take your chances." A good commander (in any environment) will know when to do this.
