Don't omit the 5 month period from your resume. It can come back to bite you if they call your employers to confirm the dates of employment. You of course can't leave the 5 month hole in your resume, just be prepared to discuss it. Several short duration jobs in this economy is not surprising. I have seen many resumes with a detour in them. I always ask about them, but their presence in the resume would not make me disqualify them. Make it clear in the resume that the new job is different than the old job. Don't use the same phrases to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments. If you are learning new skills in the new position make it clear that you really didn't regress. Be prepared to describe why you made each job switch. Knowing after almost six months that you made a mistake shows that you didn't quit after two weeks. It also shows your old employer wanted you back. The worst would be if you hated the job so much your performance suffered and they fired you. 

People use social media sites like LinkedIn to keep in contact with former co-workers, and to find new positions. You are a contractor, which isn't a bad thing, so you should state that what you are. Your text can describe the nature of the work you did/do, but each contracting company should either be listed or use the generic term contractor as employer. I wouldn't list company XYZ as my employer on either my resume, or social media. You aren't an employee of Company XYZ you are an employee of contracting company ABC. Frequently when you need to provide work history for a new job, they will call a toll free service who will verify that person X worked for company XYZ from start date to end date. You won't be in their database of current or former employees. You will be on the list of people that were given contractor access to their facility; the same as the cleaning crew, or the people that restocked the soda machine. Keep in mind that in some cases you can't reveal the customer, or in some cases the customer varies but not the contracting company. In my case I worked for 1 contracting company for years, but supported 3 different government agencies. In government contracting the contracting company may be more well known than the customer. 

Your biggest issue is that you are going to have to be perceived as the best candidate even with the negative of working 100% remote. Why is remote considered a negative? If it wasn't viewed by them as a negative, they would have allowed for that possibility when creating the job posting. If you also want to be considered a contractor and not as an employee, that also may be considered a a negative. In some organizations getting a non-employee access to certain systems is almost impossible. Even your referral may not mean much, because multiple people may also have referrals. While you could wait to get the offer, they could then pull it back when you tell them, "by the way, the core hours to be in the office as 09:00 to 15:00, will not work for me because I will be living 3,000 miles away." You may have to pre-interview where you discuss the situation, especially if they are requiring an in-person interview and have no idea you are that far away. Unless you have sold them on your awesomeness before bring up the topic the risk is that they will terminate your application immediately. But even if they think your are the best they may still reject you if they think you hid this fact from them. I would be honest with them, and if they say it won't work, then nothing has been lost. You may be better off focusing on either jobs nearby or ones where remote work is encouraged. 

You decide how much you are willing to pay for that job, generally there will be a range even for the exact same position. Shift leads, and supervisors will make even more. You also decide on the job qualifications: X years doing this, y years doing that, education of Z. Then you filter the resumes and applications. Ones that don't have the minimum qualifications or are way overqualified never get interviewed. At some point you will discuss salary, that might eliminate some others that need to make more than you are willing to pay. Notice age was never an issue. If you want the employee to have 2 years of help desk experience using system x, they could be 20 years old, or 70 years old. This could be the start of their career, or it could be their second or third career just to make extra money. In the US asking about some things is a red flag. You must have a valid reason for knowing a persons age before the hiring decision is made. Requiring that a bartender be over 21 is good, if they are there is no need to even interview them. Discriminating by age is wrong; but establishing before advertising for the position what the requirements are is acceptable. Some companies will redact candidates names, pictures, names of colleges, and graduation dates from submitted resumes to make sure the people reviewing them aren't biased. 

It depends on the procedure. If the interviewers are in separate locations and can't be on a single speakerphone then all parties will have to call in to a conference system number. Otherwise either way works. Both parties have logistical issues that have to be resolved, they may not know the number they will be using in advance. Because the company may be doing multiple phone interviews if they can reserve a conference room then that can be the number that the potential employee can call. Unless I will be doing a single interview by myself I will generally use a conference number even if I will be sitting in a conference room, so that neither party has to know the number in the room they will be using for the interview. I have worked at locations that you can't reserve a small room in advance, and the phone in the cube is not a good place to do your job search. 

Of course you list the internship. As you said "This internship gave me a good experience in testing and development of web based applications. That is what you are supposed to use to sell your self to the next employer. The ability to include the internship on a resume, and to network, is why people just starting out take an internship. If you don't include it on your resume you will either have a hole in your resume, or a resume that shows that you have zero relevant experience. Don't just list it as a one liner. Treat it like any other job. Tell us what you learned, and what tasks or projects you completed. If you are still in school they should have a office or a website that can help you prepare a proper resume. Or even have somebody at the internship look it over. Have your supervisor review it, or ask if they can recommend somebody in HR. 

The problem with the larger companies is that the recruiter is just the person that does the initial filtering of the resumes and applications. These need to exist in the system before you can move on to the next step. The bigger companies may have recruiters thousands of miles from you. They can have a set of recruiters working with college campuses, but they will be a different set from those trying to fill specific positions. Jobs you see online could be handled by either group. Even if you university has the name of a recruiter, unless they are the one tasked will filling that position, they won't be of much help. Nevertheless do try to contact the recruiter because you want to use as many approaches to the job hunt as possible. 

After every sales call or presentation you need to review what happened to see where you can make your process better. The three questions you quote as absurd (access the software, update the data, load the data) would be the first three questions I would have before you even started your presentation. If I can't see from your presentation/demo how these are answered I will be asking them at some point. 

Your idea of hosting a copy of my site would be a non-starter. That would mean that everything that I was trying to protect behind the scenes was open to your whims. You could take everything and give it my competition. The code doesn't belong to you, it belongs to your employer. You might even need permission to show screen captures. You definitely would even need permission to show snipets of the code outside the company. 

Until you have an written offer with zero contingencies, you don't have an offer that you can use to trigger notifying your current company. A background check is a contingency, because they can still decide not to hire you. Once they have removed in writing all contingencies, then you can tell your current employer and start the notice period. Doing so prior to the removal of the contingency means that you could end up unemployed. The banning the box only allows you to get past the initial stages of the hiring process, it doesn't mean that they must hire with a felony conviction. Based on the dates you provided: estimated starting date of 27 November and today's date of 11 November, if they get back to you on Monday you can still give two weeks notice, although for many places that would make your last day Wednesday the 22nd or only 8 days of work post notice. Reasonable employers know that delays in background checks delay the hiring process, because they know you can't tell your current boss without the solid written offer. So unless they have a reason for needing you by that date, and unless they have another candidate ready to go, they may have to accept a slip of a week or two. 

Sometimes you can use one of the forced delivery methods, with the letter saying that the new policy will start in 60 days. If you want to opt out do so with 30 days. Then move forward, keeping proof of delivery in each employees folder. If employment is at will in your jurisdiction stubborn refusal to even acknowledge the policy is not a problem, it can be addressed by termination of employment. 

I have been in a similar situation. I applied to several open positions in my company. Each situation develops at their own pace. At some point one of them was ready to commit and I was told that I had 72 hours to accept the position and remove myself from consideration for the other positions I had applied for. I would expect a large company to operate in a similar fashion. They should make a formal written offer with a deadline, and a set of conditions you have to meet. Until they issue the written offer you can keep any internal applications open. HR may not know the timeline for the different positions. Some parts of the hiring process are under their control others are fully under the control of the people you will be working for. I have seen situations where steps you think can be done in a few hours stretch our for two weeks because that is the way that manager operates. Until that final offer is received you need to keep all options open. I would not even hesitate to keep applying if new openings popup. 

Your mistake was mentioning the other offer. They expect that every candidate is interviewing at multiple companies. But you mentioned the other offer so now the face a dilemma. They were prepared to offer you X but you have an offer in your hand. They know that the most they can offer is X+delta. They want to know if they will win with X so they don't have to offer x+delta. They don't want to waste any more time if x+delta will be too low. Showing them the offer letter will cut right to the end. They will either just beat A's offer or they will walk away. of course if you told them how much A is offering while you were talking to HR, they want to see the letter before they push for a funding decision from the company. They don't want to maximize their offer when there was no offer. You have to decide which you want to go with. Take the written offer from A, or pursue a potentially better offer from B. Keep in mind your opinion of B's HR is not very good right now. 

In the US you would have several choices, though you should have the corporate legal department review them to make sure they meet the law. 

In the United states there is no database of employer/employee relationships. The background check company will if tasked to verify all the companies you listed on your resume/application and will contact them. For large companies they send all the requests for employment verification to a third party who will confirm dates or employment. Therefore the background check company will only be told the dates of employment. In these cases don't worry about about your current boss being told. These types of checks are also done for loans, apartment leases. I don't think you have something to worry about. But they are professionals and their goal isn't to get you fired. For smaller companies, the risk is that they will talk to somebody who will tell your current boss. Now if you told the new company that you aren't employed they will not be able to track down your current employer via a database. If you told them that you are still employed by company X, but you left weeks ago, they will find out because the employment dates won't match. 

Game development is a term that encompasses a lot of jobs and technologies. Game development companies still have testers, IT, DBAs, QC/QA positions, web designers, graphic artists, technical writers. They work in multiple languages and platforms. They also have specialized positions music, graphics, engines... But so does any other specialty program type. Medical software companies have some people that know a lot about medicine, but not everybody has to. You can work for a spacecraft development company and not be an astronaut. You can work for a company that develops software for the insurance industry and not be sure about the difference between Whole Life an Universal life. Your resume should reflect what you have done and what you can do. Apply for jobs with companies that do game development, then later leverage that experience into the job you ultimately want. But don't expect to be able to jump directly to your dream job without either education or experience. So do it in two steps. 

going back to the same position, for the same pay, after spending your time and money defending yourself doesn't make any sense. Expect they might reject all or part of your requests. Also get all the money in advance. Don't let them promise to pay you in 30 days. Also the documents you sign after the lawyer reviews them, should not require you to reimburse them if you don't work there for a minimum period. 

Yes the document is a contract. It is the applicant giving other entities, besides the current employer, a release from liability if they answer the questions requested by the potential employer. Note that it doesn't require them to answer the questions. Many companies will only provide the minimum amount of info: dates of employment, and job title. They will only provide salary information if the request is coming from a bank for a loan, or if you have explicitly requested them to provide it. The form is not unusual. If they are uncomfortable with it, they should move on to other places to apply. Over time they may realize how common it is, and accept it; or they will find an exception. While having a potential employer knowing what you made with a previous company may seem like a bad thing it doesn't force you into accepting a job that pay less then you need. Also remember knowing what I made 5 years ago tells them nothing about what I would accept to join a new company. 

They don't care if you are perfect for the job, and that you would be willing to negotiate a salary in their range. They would prefer to interview those who they know are viable. If you want to skip the question most systems will allow you to enter a small string or number. 

Open office must be defined. It is not just the presence of doors and wall, cube walls, or no walls. If I am in an shared space with people working either directly on my project, or doing the same task that I am: then there is benefit to collaboration. If the grouping of people is random then the other people are just a noise source. The only thing we have in common is trivial topics, so the only interaction we have is nonproductive. Unfortunately companies have not been willing to maintain cohesion, and they devolve into a random assortment over time. In the Unites States the GSA is pushing an office of the future. 

You have people willing to pay you to develop code. That is what you put on your resume for the summer period. Yes internships are great, but there is nothing wrong with taking a summer break to make money developing code. Plus this keeps the customers happy.
