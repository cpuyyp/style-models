On some full suspension mountain bikes some of the pivot/linkage bolts can be reverse threaded. Manufacturer dependant though. 

Assuming disc brakes, some reasons for short pad life could be: Riding conditions - If you're riding in gritty mud, pad life will be shorter than dry conditions. The mud can form a grinding paste which wears the pads quicker. Damaged rotors - If your rotors are scored or damaged, this can accelerate pad wear. If you've worn a pad down to the backing plate this can damage the rotor and lead to shorter pad life. Not bedding the pads in sufficiently - New pads straight out the packet need bedded in before use. This typically involves putting them through a few braking cycles to bring them up to a high temperature. Pads which have not been bedded in, will wear quicker when subjected to wet muddy conditions. Pad material - Brake pads come in different materials which can have different pad lives depending on usage. E.g. sintered pads should last longer in muddy conditions than resin pads. However, some brake discs are not designed for sintered pads. 

As I was changing a set of brake pads today, I was reminded of this question and realised that there is a safe way to change the pads and reset the pistons without removing the wheel and that is to unbolt the brake calliper from the fork/frame, reset the pistons and then bolt it back on. How much hassle this is will depend on the mount required to fit your calliper. If the rotor size/calliper mount is such that the calliper bolts directly to the fork/frame without any adaptor, it should be relatively easy. When remounting the calliper you'll have to re-adjust it to be centred around the disk, but you might have to do this after changing the pads anyway. However, I do think removing the wheel is the simplest and easiest way to do this. 

the big wrench below the chain whip Is for removing the cups on shimano hollowtech II bottom bracket. $URL$ the thing in the upper right corner Is for screwing in the preload cap on a shimano hollowtech II bottom bracket. The preload crap is screwed in to the non drive side crank to keep everything together before the crank is tightened onto the spindle. $URL$ the truncated triangle below the cassette tools Is a spoke wrench - each of the 3 sides fit a different size of spoke as per the numbers on the corner. You fit the side over the spoke nipple and the spoke can be tightened/loosened as required. and the thing next to it. That's a crank puller for removing cranks from an internal bottom bracket. There's a cap you unscrew with a hex wrench and then that tool screws into the thread the cap was screwed into. You then tighten the other end with a spanner which pushes the black bit through and pulls the cranks off. $URL$ Also, the small wrench opposite to the chain tool has a 90 degree protrusion at each end. This is for removing chain-ring bolts. $URL$ 

As far as for the tubes I have used, schrader valves offer a less restrictive air passage, that is they create less resistance (less pressure) on the pump side. That means that for a large volume tire, to be used at low pressure, almost any pump or even a low powered compressor will be a little bit faster. For that reason in particular, I use schreaders in my DH bike (2.5 tires) and prestas in my XC bikes (2.3, 2.1 and even 1.8). I once used presta on my DH, but it took forever to inflate with a hand pump. 

My late answer will be very similar to the other (s), but I want to contribute with various experiences. First, proper brake lever travel gives you optimum brake performance for your system and hand size. Effectively the brake lever should make the pads touch the rim a little before your hand reaches top "grip force". This is because several parts on the system flex or compress a little before really beguin acting, causing the lever to travel a bit further down before any braking force is developed. When you start squeezing the lever, the hand forms a hook with the last joint. Continue squeezing until the hook is formed with the middle joint. Most people would have the strongest grip when this "hook" is roughly 90 degree (observe hands carrying a lot of grocery bags for example). This is the point where your levers should act. With caliper brakes you calibrate this by releasing or taking up cable, that is loosening the bolt that holds the cable, sliding it and tightening again. Then you fine tune using the barrel adjusting bolt(the one the cable goes through). Other systems have this bolt in the lever, for example cantilever, v-brake or linear pull and almost any lever designed for straight handlebars. On the maintenance side, I recommend replacing the pads before they loose to much flexibility, (the get dry and stiff with time). But before that happens, periodic cleaning enhances breaking performance. I use kitchen products to clean my brakes. Dish washing soap is designed to break grease but does not damage rubber nor plastics. I also use a dish washing pad, the famous brand is Scotch Brite, but the generics work as well. These pads are designed to be barely abrasive, so they remove hardened food without damaging antiadherent coating from cooking pots. This is why I recommend them for brake pad cleaning; they remove grease and stuck debris without wasting pad material. The general grease removing capabilities of these products work wonders with rim brakes and are cheap and easy to find. 

I think that repair kits are thought for repair shops where patching tubes is more frequent, so you can use all the glue before it dries up inside the tube. Smaller kits that are for emergencies include two to five patches, and a very small tube of glue, generally enclosed in a disposable case, but are not universally available. My trick to get a little more out of a glue tube is that I pile up a few punctured inner tubes, and patch them at home, all of them at a time so I use more glue every time. Then I always carry one of these tubes in my backpack so I just change the tube, instead of patching while in the trails. At least in My country it's easy to find only the tubes of glue, which I find curious: Is it that manufacturers know patches last longer than the glue?
