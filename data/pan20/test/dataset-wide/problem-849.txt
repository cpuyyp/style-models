The first data release from GAIA was in 2016 so fairly new. If you want to be certain you should take a look at it because as you say, GAIA will no doubt be the source of the most accurate parallax measurements in the near future. Speaking of accuracy, I believe that this is the essence of your question because it basically depends on how uncertain measurements you are willing to accept. Basically, modern values of parallaxes are very small numbers, e.g. 0.1 milliarcsec which means a distance of d(pc) = 1/(parallax in arc-seconds) around 10,000 pc (one parsec is 3.26 light years). But the important point is the accuracy of these estimates. Clearly if your measurements is 0.1 milliarcsec, but the accuracy is 1 milliarcsec, it would be going out on a limb to postulate that you have measured a distance of 10,000 pc. So the real answer to your question is another question "to what accuracy?" So if you want something like 10 or 20 % accuracy you are more or less limited to our neighbourhood, say some 200 pc. If you check out ESA's website on stellar parallax, they will go up to 500 pc but it really depends on what level of accuracy your work requires. If you check out the GAIA satellite then the aim is actually to go down to an accuracy of 24 micro-arc seconds so whatever object is measured to be farthest (with a given accuracy) is sure to replaced as the data from GAIA is analysed. For fun, you might wanna look at this also found at the GAIA website.. I think it provides a nice visual guideline to what distances we can expect (and it also nicely shows a ring at 500 pc - the limit of fairly accurate measurements from Hipparchos!) 

Extraterrestial intelligence is a hard research topic as the search for evidence is not straight forward in any way. The search for intelligent life as far as I know is limited to observations in radio and for that you want to see if any SETI members are UK based. However if you're more into astrobiology in general you might wanna look up the UK Centre for Astrobiology which is based in Edinburgh. I don't know any of the faculty but I do know that they are hosting a meeting for early career scientists in 2017. There are also some smaller research groups based in the UK but you might wanna check out the specific research aim for these (e.g. the group at Imperial College in London is focused on Mars) as it might not be the area within astrobiology that interests you the most. There is also Mark Burchell who is a professor at the University of Kent. His group did some exciting work on Panspermia (the idea of life travelling through space) that I happened to read earlier this year. Note that this is focused on microorganisms so this is probably as far from "intelligence" that it gets. But you can try to look up departments at different universities. You probably want to look under astronomy or sometimes physical or Earth science as the research aims of some groups put them more in e.g. Earth science than actual astronomy. Sometimes you can also find smaller groups under biology or life science. 

A little exposure without other complications will generally be survivable. We don't have a ton of data on the subject, so it's possible that unpredictable complications could arise, and frankly it's not exactly advisable, especially considering the person will lose consciousness quite quickly. 

This isn't really a huge problem. Space isn't necessarily cold. The extraordinarily low density of matter in space means that the movement of energy through induction is extremely limited. If one were to step into 'space' one wouldn't feel cold, or even cool. For engineers, often the greater problem is not how to deal with cold, but how to deal with heat, as even though one can't easily release heat through induction, one can certainly gain it through radiation or internal chemical processes. A person, however, is likely to experience cooling due to the process of liquids in the body evaporating and escaping, taking some of their heat with them. It's unlikely that this would prove fatal though, or at least it's unlikely to be the first thing to prove fatal. 

As you've said, the definition of binary star systems would mean that the cases you are describing would not be considered binary star systems. That said, there are other arrangements which exceed binary, but are often thought of as including binary relationships. This is due to star systems which reach beyond binary often resulting in hierarchical arrangements. For instance, many triple star systems involve what is largely a close binary star system with a third star that orbits the pair at a much greater distance. For an extreme example of this, consider Castor, which is a sextuple star system containing three binary star pairs. These systems wouldn't technically be said to be binary star systems, but rather to contain binary pairs, but given the question I can't think of a better way of having a binary star system that isn't a binary star system. Note that the hierarchical nature of super-binary systems is a matter of system evolution. Systems which would not be considered hierarchical are believed to be unstable, which would eventually result in the ejection of a star from the system. 

Yes. Most consumer telescopes can be used for terrestrial viewing (or at least the ones I have used) and are often utilized for wildlife viewing or other uses for extreme telephoto requirements. The manual doesn't list the minimum focus distance (usually the information provided for photographic lens to describe how near they can focus), but the manual does include a short passage (pg 25) on terrestrial viewing. 

Has the Roche limit affect been observed having an effect on an constructed object gravitational wise to cause damage? Could the Roche limit be used to slow an object? 

There are many types of orbit around the Earth. Is there an orbit where the moon can pull an object traveling in parallel with the moon's orbit to Earth allowing the object pulled along by the moon's gravity slightly providing the force needed for the object to indefinitely sustain orbit around Earth? I'm not talking about the Lagrange points around the moon, but a distance out side of them where the moon over takes the object and as it passes it reinforcing the force needed to the object to stay in an orbit around Earth. More like a moon assisted orbit. 

Is there a observable void outside our universe that can give a clue on how far the next on is? How many universes can surround ours? What does a universes gravity well look like? 

Is a orbit possible where 2 objects going in opposite directions can intersect repeatedly with minor course corrections? 

Unlike Saturn's moons our moon is relatively much larger in ratio to the size of the Earth. Earth's moon's orbit is also elliptical and is at a tilt to its equator because of this would a ring last and what would the ring look like? Does the moon disrupted a defined ring from forming? This is a picture of space garbage of artificial satellites. 

Is the Earth losing or gaining distance from the sun overall? Could asteroids over time add weight to the Earth and push it farther from the sun more than having a degrading orbit around the sun? Does asteroids and space dust increase the mass the the outer planets over sustaining or pulling the Earth from the Sun? 

It is said that planets are continuously moving away from the sun. At one time Mars was just the right distance to support life at least temperature wise? Could Venus be far enough from the sun eventually to cool down? Related: Are planets moving away from the sun? Is Earth losing orbit? 

I read about natural gravitational eddies that travel in a wave that black holes have. They also have a strong magnetic field. Does those eddies follow magnetic field lines of the rotating black hole? Can a galaxies have their own gravitational eddies like a black hole does? 

There is an uncountable amount of stars from our perspective, but space does have a limit of size which is the distance which subatomic particle and matter as traveled since the big bang and with that limit of stars. Although stars die and form beyond our ability to count so observably we can never have an exact count of stars at anytime as well. I would bet on answer B because The universe does have a total mass of about 25 billion galaxies. We can mathematically calculate the mass of our universe. 

19390101 is the date (1939-01-01). The first zero (Marked as SC) is the station code, the second the recorded hour, and the third the recorded minute (H/M). Most of this is 0 due to being interpolated data. After this information, there are 72 remaining columns (numbered 1-72 above), which represents collected data consolidated in groups of 5 degrees, presumably starting at 0. Given the amount of interpolation of old data the value may be questionable, but newer data appear to be more complete. The data format might be a little overwhelming to work with, but you can organize it in excel quite easily - paste it in and each line break will form a row, then use the text-to-column function to break each data into its own column. 

The crop size is defined by the sensor size. Any light that spreads beyond the sensor is not captured. By increasing the area of the image, the portion that is within the sensor decreases, resulting in a cropped image that appears to be zoomed in. A telescope works in a very similar fashion, but the telescope has a fixed focal length and fixed aperture. As these are all fixed, the telescope is generally engineered to utilize all light, where as a DSLR level camera will be built to allow diverse lens selection, which results in a lot of light wasted (light that is cropped by not reaching the viewfinder or sensor). The light is finally adjusted by the eyepiece. As everything before the eyepiece is more or less fixed, the type of eyepiece is a direct trade between total light and image size. It should probably also be noted, that 'More distance = More zoom' isn't true everywhere in optics. Microscopes, for instance, tend to be designed in the opposite fashion. 

It may be difficult to find proper photos that emulate this, both because given the tools and the subject, most people would opt for longer exposures, and also because of the general difficulty in emulating how our brain processes visual information into an image, especially in low-light or high contrast situations like this. I think the photo at the bottom of this article may be a decent recreation of it, though it's a bit fuzzy and not so wide. Note: There are star trails forming in the image, which is indicative of it being a longer exposure. The image (unless cropped) doesn't appear to be from a wide-angle lens - I would guess somewhere in the 35-50mm range. Perhaps a 10 secondish exposure, but my judgement is more based on result than technique. What you can see will depend a lot upon the conditions of the night. You're probably not expecting a lot of light pollution, but you also have to keep in mind that your eyes will adjust to light as well. A cell phone or a full moon can be enough to prevent you from being able to see well. If conditions are perfect - little to no light pollution, no light from cars, flashlights, etc, a new moon, low humidity/no clouds, etc, and the milky way is in a good position, you will be able to pick out the galaxy quite well. You should be able to notice both the high concentration of stars as well as the 'milky' lighter shade caused by the many stars too dim or distant to appear bright.
