New Zealand is relatively new country. It essentially was founded in 1840 in a contract between the native Maori people and the British Government. For some reason a large chunk of the housing stock in New Zealand is badly insulated and drafty and cold, compared to houses in Europe for example.* I don't understand how a country that was essentially built in the modern era, has built such bad houses. What economic factors contribute to this? *Here's a good paper about the subject. PDF. 

The important thing to note here, is that the best outcome from the perspective of an individual country is that they don't cooperate on climate change, but the rest of the world does. And it's worth mentioning, that it is the position of many countries in the world that they shouldn't have to pay the full economic cost. Typically the argument is that poorer countries like African nations and India have not yet developed their economies to the same extent that rich western nations have, and that a completely equal reduction emissions would stifle that development. But the scenario where the whole world doesn't cooperate is much worse the scenario of paying the cooperate cost, and avoiding the catastrophe. Individual countries can use this knowledge to leverage themselves a lesser obligation to climate change targets. That is - an individual country knows that every other country values avoiding catastrophe more than the cost to pick up the slack of this individual country. So you can have a situation where some countries are going to free ride on the cooperation of the other countries, in order to get this most beneficial position of avoiding catastrophe, as well as not paying the economic cost. There are few things the other countries can do in response: 

There are also 'irrational' explanations, such as the investor being caught up in the hype, or fearing missing out. The question is, is investor behaviour during bubbles well studied, and are there models explaining it? 

Banks and stock exchanges all around the world seem to adhere to quite a strict regime of 9-5, Monday - Friday, in the countries local time. This can have the effect of where an event that happens overnight, causes the market to open at an immediate dip as happened recently on Wall Street in response to economic data from China. The question is - in today's always-on, all connected world, why does this system still remain? I would have thought that for industry that is all about making money, they'd be the first to be always on. 

The New Zealand dollar has reached parity with the Australian dollar for the first time in more than forty years. The question is - what are the economic factors that have caused this? 

I'll partially answer this question, by pointing out that this is a classic prisoner's dilemma issue. 

GDP as a measure of the well being of an economy has been criticised as not being an accurate measure of the quality of an economy, as it excludes non-commericial interactions (such as housework or volunteer work) and includes negative events (such as graffiti and cleaning up after it) as economic activity. However, at the same time, GDP is a good predictor of a society's wellbeing. Some people have suggested instead of relying on GDP as the primary measure of an economy's performance, we should use something like the Genuine Progress Indicator (warning: PDF). The question is, how much traction does this idea have, in economic circles? 

Discount rate is rate at which actors will value something that occurs in the future at less than its value now. A simple hypothetical test that would determine this would be: 

Now you buy a factory with the \$1m. You write a cheque to Bob who you're buying the factory from. He banks with XYZ bank. Your books: 

I know that in New Zealand, the wholesale price of electricity is set using a spot market, whereby every half hour, each of the electricity producers provide offers for how much electricity they can supply at each price level, and then when the actual amount of electricity is used, they producers are paid at the highest value need for all units of electricity supplied, with the lowest offers being utilised first. The market is regulated by the Electricity Authority, which is an independent crown entity, while the transmission of electricity is managed by Transpower, which is a state owned enterprise. In practise what this means, is that the producers will offer their renewable energy for free, and price their coal/oil at a higher rate. Some coal/oil is always needed and so this higher rate is determines how much the producers are paid for their cheaper energy supplied. My question is, how else can and are electricity prices determined around the world? 

Economic wealth (ie. GDP) per capita is increasing around the world. We can refer to this as 'the pie is getting bigger'. At the same time, inequality (the distribution of the pie) is also increasing. Economic inequality is correlated with social harm, such as crime. 

The more cynical (or perhaps realistic) of us would argue that there's a fair amount of game theory going on in the dating game. For example a classic ploy is 'Don't ring for three days, because you don't want to come across too keen'. Of course this rule is now widely considered obsolete (as would be natural in any game). A fairly straight forward hypothesis I would put forward is: 

As far as I can see there are two senses in which it's 'rational' for an investor to buy during a bubble. 

I'm a bit perplexed that eBay has auctions that have a fixed time ending, and so winners are often determined by who can 'snipe' the auction, by putting in the winning bid at the last possible microsecond. Often specialised software is used to achieve this. An alternative system, like New Zealand's Trade Me auction site uses, is that the auction is auto-extended by two minutes, if a bid is put within the last two minutes of the auction. What this means in practise (from what I've seen in auctions I've particpated in) is that an auction might be extended by 10-30 minutes due to 'last minute' bids between two or more bidders. Now, it should be noted that the auto-extending dynamic doesn't completely negate the sniping dynamic. For example if Bob sees that Alice has put a bid on a item for \$1000, which is due to close in two days, and Bob is willing to spend \$2000 on that item, it still makes sense for Bob to hold off bidding on the auction until closing time. Alice may not be paying attention\be at her computer (though trade me allows auto-bids) at closing time, and by bidding at the last minute, he reduces the window in which she can outbid him. This auto-extending system seems like it evaluates the market value more genuinely than the sniping system. Ebay is surely aware of this dynamic, and it must be a conscious decision to keep the sniping-allowed system. My hypothesis is that systems that allow sniping encourage higher selling prices, as bidders pre-emptively increase their bids as to stay out of the sniper's willing-to-bid range. 

In the prisoner's dilemma - in a single instance of the game and assuming no collaboration between the prisoners and assuming no other costs (ie. you're not going to be shamed for being a snitch), the best move is to betray the other. 

Here's a hypothetical society. The currency is gold coins. These can't be created virtually or counterfeited. There's a limited number of them in our society. I happen to have 1000 myself, and because I own them, I create a bank and I can lend them out. If people deposit their coins into my bank, I can't lend those coins out. Therefore I have no reason to look after them for them, unless I start charging 'safe keeping' fees. Because I only have 1000 coins to lend, but lots of people to lend to, I lend my coins to who's paying the highest . I can't make a new loan until the old one is paid back. This means that it's much much much harder for anybody to borrow money. They can either borrow money now and pay exorbitant interest, or they must save money before they spend it. Somebody that has a great business idea, but needs the capital to fund it, needs to wait five years while saving money for it, or else he sells shares in his business. I guess he's allowed to borrow the supplies he needs directly from the suppliers. But this means that the suppliers assume all the risk in the case that business fails. Suppliers would subscribe to 'risk assessment' services who match ideal borrowers to the suppliers, since it's now the supplier holding the risk. When someone purchases something with gold coins, the gold coins then sit the seller's vault doing nothing, as the seller doesn't need to spend the coins right now but may need to use them tomorrow, so he can't lend them out, unless he's doing some 'day to day' lending scheme, which would be hard for the borrower in this case to payback unless they had some surefire way to pay the loan back each day. 

And so forth, to determine just how much someone values money now, over money in the future. Discount rates can explain why criminals for example, commit seemingly irrational crimes - the cost of potential imprisonment being discounted because it's an abstract outcome that occurs in the future, compared to an immediate gain now. My question is - is there research into what factors affect and individual's discount rate? Eg. things like age, education, income. And in what circumstances was the discount rate being measured? 

Part of how high frequency trading works, is by taking advantage of millisecond advantages over other traders in communicating with the stock exchange. To gain these advantages, high frequency traders have moved their servers closer to the stock exchange's server, or have rebuilt a a Chicago - New York IP cable to be straighter and thus reduce latency by milliseconds. To create a 'fair playing field', traders can put all their servers in the same building, and each be given the same length of cabling. HFT has been criticised essential for giving the high frequency traders an unfair advantage. My question is - why not just make the stock exchange work on a one second 'tick'. ie. during that second trades are queued up, and on the tick, they are all executed simultaniously. This would prevent any - 'see other people's trades and buy them before they do' type trades.
