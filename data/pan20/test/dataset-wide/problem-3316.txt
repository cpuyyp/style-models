From a purely linguistic scientific point of view, i.e. abstracting from all humane feelings such as compassion &c., I would say the most important reason to care about languages dying out is data. Generally, those languages that die out, are also the least attested and least researched ones. Since written material and recordings are usually scarce, with the death of the last native speaker, we irreversibly lose the possibility to ever properly investigate the language. This is bad because linguists care about languages (or at least they should), and they care about parallels, cognates, reflexes and other things that can help them study other languages. The real reason, however, why so many linguists are nowadays interested in dying languages is fashion, in my opinion. The trend goes hand in hand with ecology, manifesting appreciation for other cultures and other typically late 20th c. points of view, and brutally speaking it has become fashionable in some centres to conduct field research. This is not to say field research hasn't been done earlier; just not in that scale. Also, not all people interested in languages are necessarily sit-at-home type of people. Field research gives them a great opportunity to study what they like the way they like it. But the phenomenon is not without a dark side, either. Field research is a costly enterprise and requires a specific set of mind, which does not cooccur terribly often with a scientific attitude. As a result, a great deal of field research nowadays is done by 'curiosity hoppers', i.e. collectors of linguistic pecularities (and their own fame) from a multitude of randomly chosen exotic languages, none of which they ever become specialists in. Sort of cabinet of curiosities kind of attitude. As a consequence, a lot of data thus collected is totally unreliable and next to useless, and proper linguists find it very difficult to obtain further funding because the languages they want to investigate are, in theory, already described. Edit: removed a specific example because apparently some users consider a warning against dilettantism to be equivalent to wishing a language to die out. My aim was not to start a flame so just see the history of this post if you're interested. 

So you can see that the distinction is a gradient and comes down eventually to the proportion. Unfortunately, no scale or mathematical formula seems to exist which would allow to specify the feeling. The process is not limited to phonemes. I wrote "phoneme/word/anything" above. It's because this is how we perceive familiarity in general. In the 19th c., English purists attempted to convince the society to abandon French, Latin &c. loan words and thus 'purify' the language. The slogan they came up with was Use exclusively Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. In case you wondered, use is a borrowing from French. 

Polish originally did not have /f/. When the Latin name Stephanus was borrowed, it was adapted to Szczepan [ščepan]. But later many other words with /f/ have been borrowed and Poles began to perceive it as a native sound. The connection between Stephanus and Szczepan became obscure, and the name was borrowed again, yielding Stefan [stefan] this time. (Both exist in modern Polish and are seen as two separate names.) Turkish originally did not have either /f/ or /ž/. Since the 10th century, however, it has borrowed a large number of words with /f/ but only relatively few with /ž/. As a result, the former is now seen as a native sound much more than the latter. 

I don't quite see the link between your question about word boundaries and what syllables the language permits. Could you elaborate? As for one versus two words, I don't think there is a universal method. It mostly depends on what the particular language does to its words and affixes, e.g. 

Language is a complex system used simultaneously by a large number of people. Changes typically begin on a very limited area and spread to eventually encompass the entire language. (Or not. That's a simple version of how dialects come into being.) Whether they succeed and spread or fail and die out, depends on how people (individuals) talk to one another. In other words, changes in language spread not entirely unlike diseases. It is usually relatively easy to find out how and where a pandemic started but it is very difficult to foresee one. There are many places in the world where the hygienic conditions are horrible but somehow a pandemic does not break out. (That is similar to Aaron's example of English having been ripe for developing NC for centuries.) And at the same time, there are places where hygienic conditions are not bad at all, and yet a disease can from time to time manage to spread very far. Another analogy would be road or air traffic. When an accident happens, we are usually able to reconstruct how it happened. But regrettably, we are no good at predicting where and when one is going to happen, so we can't prevent it. 

A nice pair to look at is Finnish and Estonian. They are (very) closely related but due to a relatively low number of mostly sound changes, Estonian has quite moved towards inflection, while Finnish remained agglutinative. For starters, you might want to take a look at H. Metslang's paper A General Comparison of Estonian and Finnish, from which I took the following examples: 

My guess would be that notions such as case, number or gender could be expressed in this way. Or maybe some sign language requires some kind of agreement between e.g. an adjective and a noun? Examples of what I'm not interested in: 1. ASL for 'person' used after a verb (because it makes sense if used alone); 2. and 3. exaggerating the ASL sign for 'big' to obtain 'huge' (because it's the semantics that is modified, not the grammatical function); 4. signing slow slower in ASL to denote 'very slow' (because it's limited to this one word). 

The Slavic languages were mentioned above, as they often are in the context of a three-way gender system, but the case is actually a little more complicated. I will limit myself to Polish. The traditional, Latin-inspired interpretation is masculine, feminine, neuter, the division being mainly defined by phonetics. Feminines end mostly in -a, -i, and palatalized consonants, neuters in -o, -e, and -ę, and everything else (mostly non-palatalized consonants) is masculine. Plus a few semantic exceptions, e.g. mężczyzna 'man, male', or poeta '(male) poet' are masculine despite their endings. A more modern approach is to distinguish as many as five genders for the singular, but only two for the plural. In the singular, these would be: 1a. masculine (people), 1b. masculine (animate), 1c. masculine (inanimate), 2. feminine, 3. neuter. In the plural, just 1. masculine (people), 2. everything else. This distinction is based, like the traditional one, on endings, but unlike it, this one also takes into account the accusative. Specifically, in which number it is the same as the genitive, and in which it is the same as the nominative. The whole thing is actually a bit complicated. You might want to take a look at $URL$ and especially $URL$ My point is that the more you think about it, the more fuzzy the notion of gender becomes. In the case of Polish, it becomes some weird cross between declension types, syntax and semantics, and makes it really difficult to answer your question. I think you'd need a pretty sturdy definition of gender before venturing anywhere further with whatever idea made you ask this question, and it isn't going to be easy to find or construct one. 

Stress is perhaps the most universal method, as almost all languages have it, and in your example it must be either one or two. Counterexamples: 1. one can always claim li is a separate word which might lose its accent in certain combinations; 2. stress solves nothing in cases such as Polish w 'in' or z 'from' which are only made up of a single consonant and so can't be stressed anyway (they count as separate words, in case you're interested). The possibility to insert a separate word in between can also help answer your question. How would you say 'the smart dog' in your language? Can 'smart' go between li and stulu? Counterexamples: German, Dutch, Hungarian &c. separable verbs are typically counted as one word, although they can be separated, their order swapped, and other words inserted in between. Vowel harmony is a good method in languages which have it. Counterexamples: Hungarian -kor temporalis does not harmonize with the stem, yet it is counted as a suffix rather than a separate word. Mutations which only happen on morpheme boundaries. Unfortunately, no ready example comes to my mind. Native speaker intuition would be a great method if it only weren't so shaky. It's a sort of chicken and egg problem with NS intuition and spelling, e.g. Russian v 'in' was first written together with the word, and later the spelling was changed to separate. 

There's a paper by I.I. Popescu and G. Altmann 2008, Hapax Legomena and Language Typology, Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 15/4, 370–78. Unfortunately, they don't give Finnish and Estonian data but if anyone here is good enough at statistics to calculate it, I'd be very interested to find out the results, and how to achieve them. 

A good question, but I'm afraid there's no good answer to it. The phenomenon has been noticed by linguists some time ago, and we have two terms: loan words and foreign words. For the latter also the German term is sometimes used, Fremdwort (pl. Fremdwörter) -- incidentally, itself a good example of its own meaning. There is at least one more like that in English, namely menu. I don't know why it hasn't been adapted better. Maybe because it's a 'vocabulary word', maybe because there aren't many more like it, and maybe both. But the second possibility is key here: the feeling of nativeness of a phoneme/word/anything is a function of its frequency. English native speakers don't perceive [œ] as native because it's only there in very few (possily just one) words, and not a very frequent one to that. As it is, it's a foreign word. If there were many more like it, they would become loan words. Two examples: 

In loanwords, however, this distribution is disturbed, e.g. [ḱ] can occur in a back environment in Turkish ([kar] 'snow' : [ḱar] 'profit'), but [k] still can't occur in a front environment. In Bashkir, where the opposition has shifted from [k] : [ḱ] to [q] : [k], the latter can be found in a back environment, too, but I'm not sure whether [q] can be found in a front one. All examples off the top of my head, but can be found in probably any Turkic grammar. (Only I'd suggest, if you settle for Turkish, that you use e.g. Ersen-Rasch (in German) or Stachowski (in Polish) because all English grammars I know of are not terribly good in my opinion.) As a counter example, in Polish, *[k] and *[g] have been conserved in all surroundings except before [i] (< *[y]) and [e], where, in the Middle Ages, they > [ḱ] and [ǵ], respectively. Examples: 

But, in Polish exactly the same thing happened with *[p] and *[b]. All examples from Mańczak W. 1983, Polska fonetyka i morfologia historyczna, Warszawa. 

The short answer: they don't. The long answer: It isn't black and white. Some phrases certainly are grammatical (attested many times in different places and different contexts), some (almost) certainly aren't (never attested in a huge and diversified corpus), and all the rest is somewhere in between. English continuous tense is in the former category. But if English died out today and future archaeologists only discovered, say, the Bible, they wouldn't be sure that the structure was also stylistically acceptable in a secular context. If they only discovered a transcript of an IRC chat, they could think it was limited to slang. And so on. For example, for Old Turkic we have almost nothing more than official stelae. Plenty of constructions and words are missing, and we can't be sure that they did really exist at that time. We can reconstruct them based on what we find in later texts, but this isn't as certain as if they had been actually written down. Sadly, no widely accepted method of quantifying this probability exists. The situation is similar with languages which are at the verge of extinction right now. If there are only, say, three speakers left, we can't go too far in making claims about the entire language. Usually in such cases, however, we simply consider the lect of these three people to be the language. Everyone knows this isn't exactly true, and everyone knows we simply can't do any better. It's just easier to give it a short name than to note every time when we refer to it, that it's only based on the evidence of three speakers. Asking a native speaker directly usually isn't a good idea. It's better to just make them talk as much as possible and record everything, and only ask to explain the unclear parts. Various cultural rules might interfere, such as e.g. the informer might consider it impolite to point out to strangers (= guests) that they made a mistake, and he or she will confirm the grammaticality of an ungrammatical construction merely not to offend. Summing up, everything comes down to quantity and proportions. But regrettably, everything is evaluated by intuition. There is no official scale that would determine a certain phrase is 60% grammatical or anything of the sort. However, when you think about it, I suppose you might find it difficult to judge precisely how grammatical/acceptable/natural e.g. long time no see is in modern English.
