The short answer is 'yes', it is professional. In fact, it's not just professional but desirable. And I base that answer not on opinion but on reviewing the research on the topic. Let me explain. I read this post a few weeks ago, and was intrigued not just by the number of answers but by the lack of consensus. Like others here, I'd assumed this question was now redundant, given how we've all long gotten over the whole 'look at me with a new iPhone' thing. But I'd begun wondering about it again after the default signature reappeared on my iPhone after a software update. I'd hesitated to just change it. (OK, I procrastinated, as I was irritated that I had to do it again, having carefully set up my mobile signature a couple of years back.) Then I wondered if I was actually better off leaving it as it was. Which is why this thread caught my eye. Rather than just add my two cents', I decided to see if there had been any research on the topic. It turns out that there has. A few years ago, two social scientists at the University of Oklahoma tested emails with and without 'Sent from my iPhone' on over a hundred volunteers, to see how each affected perception of the sender. In particular, they wanted to test whether the line reduced the damaging effect of grammar errors and typos. What they found was that, while such mistakes did indeed have a negative effect on perception, 'Sent from my iPhone' significantly reduced that effect. The reason is that we're all programmed to look for cues that help us judge the people we're communicating with. In a nutshell, we want to know whether we can trust and believe them – a concept covered by an idea called Uncertainty Reduction Theory (first put forward in 1975). Mistakes in an email increase uncertainty about the sender, but other cues called 'high-warrant' cues can reduce it. 'Sent from my iPhone' is the second type of cue. So those people here who've suggested it buys you leeway are spot-on: it repairs some of the damage that typos (or hurried, terse replies) do to your credibility. The original Oklahoma study research paper is here. I've also written up the research findings in more detail on my blog here. I may have geeked out a little, but it strikes me as a fascinating area – not least because I've never come across these ideas in any business books (despite working in communication for about 25 years). If the people we email (etc.) are all driven by the desire to reduce uncertainty, then tweaking what we write to help them with that (by including these cues) can only improve our work relationships. Adding something like 'Sent from my mobile – apologies for any typos or strange predictive text' seems like one easy, simple way to do just that. 

A title means exactly what a particular company intends it to mean nothing more nothing less. Some companies use "programmer". Some companies use "developer". Some use both. Some use neither. A company that uses both may have some sort of hierarchy. Or it may not. A "Developer 1" at one company could well be the most senior title for someone that writes code while at another company "Developer 1" is the most junior title. I wouldn't get too hung up on a title. If someone is looking at a resume, the description of what someone did is far more important than the title. 

Can your offer be rescinded? Absolutely. Is it likely that your offer will be rescinded? Not particularly, no. If the company has gone through a long interview process, determined that you're the best candidate for the job, extended an offer, negotiated a salary, started the process behind the scenes of getting you set up in all of their systems, etc. they're not likely to rescind the offer based on a small mistake. Of course, you might be unlucky and this mistake might disqualify you for this company or this position or this manager. Details like how long ago the collection was, what impact it has on your credit score, whether there are tons of other equally good candidates in line, whether the company invested a lot of time in interviewing you already or whether they're hiring a bunch of commission-only salespeople with the expectation that some will do well and some will get let go rather quickly will all play a role. You would have been better served telling the employer earlier in the process about any negative information on your credit report given that you knew they would need to pull it as part of your background check. Not only does that give you the opportunity to explain the issue, that allows the hiring manager to tell you whether that would be an issue for the particular company and the particular position you're applying for. And it allows the hiring manager to diffuse the impact when the background check actually happens. Politically and psychologically, knowing in advance that there is a small issue is much easier to take than being surprised at the 11th hour. If you haven't even completed the paperwork for the background check yet and you have a relationship with the hiring manager from your time as an intern, I'd drop him or her an email. Let the hiring manager know that you just became aware of an issue that's likely going to show up on your background check when they pull your credit. Give a brief explanation of the issue. Then you can ask the hiring manager whether you need to do anything special as part of filling out the background check paperwork in order to ensure that this doesn't become an issue. Most likely, the hiring manager will tell you not to worry about it. If it is something that is going to cause a problem in HR, though, the hiring manager can help you work through it. 

I recently had my duties reassigned so that I'm heading a new project for SSIS DTSX Packages. The instructions I were provided were very vague and did not make much sense, but since I've been affiliated with the system for so long, I had a good sense of what direction my manager was going. The project requires several DTSX packages to be created, with the first package having a deadline to prove that I'm capable of doing the project. I created the DTSX package and provided it to my manager about a week prior to it being due for testing purposes or to see if there were any additional features that were desired since the instructions were so vague. After about six days, my manager responded stating that I did not follow the original directions of creating a DTSX package and that I need to send him the project as a DTSX package. He threatened that if it was not completed prior to the deadline that there would be consequences. After receiving the email, it's clear to me that my manager has not utilized anything within SSIS. How do I tell my manager that I've already sent him the DTSX package without being disciplined? 

Two months ago, our IT team received an email that a new position had been created in our department. We were informed that our positions would not be impacted. Strangely, my direct manager scheduled and held a call later in the week with just myself and one other person in the department for the exact same topic. After a new hire was found for this position, I was scheduled a one on one call with my direct manager which was called "IT Update". When attending the call, the HR Director was also on the call (I had no knowledge of this). My direct manager told me that my position no longer existed in the department and that if I did not accept a newly created position in the data department, I would be laid off. I had two hours to accept the new position otherwise I would be laid off anyway. In order to keep income, I was forced to accept the new position which doesn't fit my skill set well. After signing for the document for the new position, my old job was immediately posted for hire. It is well known that my direct manager does not like me (I'm not sure why). I'd like to go to the owner of the company about this as I've known him closely for the entirety of my career. There was no layoff package mentioned. Is this legal? Would it be worth taking steps to apply to my original position? When looking for a new position, what would be the best way to put a positive spin on this on my resume and during an interview? 

If you're not willing to talk to your manager and don't have an HR department, your options are probably limited to living with it or moving on. I don't understand why you aren't willing to talk to your manager, though, these are exactly the sorts of things that managers sign up to deal with. Sure, it won't be a fun discussion to have. But I'm sure your manager will be more tense if you quit because of the behavior rather than airing your concerns. If you're really adamant about not involving your manager, your long-shot options are to have another conversation with your coworker or to try to organize the other folks in your group to have a collective conversation with the coworker. If you were at all unclear in your discussion with your coworker that you were seriously bothered rather than being concerned about his medical status, you could try having another conversation with the coworker. If others are bothered, you could all have a conversation but that involves more confrontation than simply bringing the matter to the attention of your manager. You're already wearing headphones so that, presumably, takes care of the noise. You've said that there isn't an aroma problem. So it seems all that's left is learning to ignore whatever a "fart type position" is. 

You don't specify where you are. In the United States, it is very common for large companies to have a policy against giving references (other parts of the world may have different customs) because they fear it exposes them to liability. If an employee gives a bad reference, the company is theoretically vulnerable to a libel lawsuit. If an employee gives a good reference, the company is theoretically vulnerable to a lawsuit for failing to disclose some material fact. It is possible that a manager would violate that policy, of course. But it would be unlikely that they would do so in order to badmouth a former employee. A manager would have to have a major grudge to be willing to risk their job in order to violate a company policy in order to spite a former employee particularly when a negative reference gives the candidate much more incentive to contact HR and get the manager in hot water. It's more likely that a manager would skirt the policy to give a good reference for someone they really liked since that is much less likely to get reported to HR but even that is pretty rare. If you are really paranoid and think you manager really has it out for you, you could always have a friend call your former company posing as HR from some company looking to hire you to see what sort of reference they'll give you. If you were planning on having a conversation about the reference on your last day, though, that would strongly imply that things were cordial enough that no one would be likely to violate company policy on references just to torpedo you.
