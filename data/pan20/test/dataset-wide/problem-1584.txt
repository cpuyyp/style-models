Yes, if the woman has reliable cycles and also pays attention to her cervical fluid. When a woman ovulates, it intrinsically causes a rise in progesterone (this is known as the luteal phase). The presence of progesterone causes the body's basal temperature to rise by a few centigrade. Therefore, a slight raise in the BBT mid-cycle helps to confirm the beginning of the luteal phase, ie. ovulation. This 'temperature shift' pattern becomes predictable if the woman has consistent, normal cycles and so charting one's BBT (which is what the Lady Comp does for you) will give you a good idea of when to avoid sexual intercourse due to the foreseen ovulation. According to one study (1): 

The answer is yes, it can happen after death, but only SHORTLY after death. This is due to the contracting and expanding of the related muscles, which do not necessarily "shut down" immediately after death. $URL$ Two or three hours after death, rigor mortis sets in. This is a chemical stiffening of the muscles that prevents the kind of activity described above. $URL$ So the "window" doesn't last very long. 

It seems to have to do with childhood nutrition. In their book "Generations," (Pp.175-176, 267), William Strauss and Neil Howe pointed out that one reason that Americans won the American Revolution was that their better nutrition made them two inches taller (5' 7'' vs. 5'5'') on average than the Redcoats, who were nearly two CENTURIES behind them in height. They also pointed out that the so-called World War II generation (born after 1900) was more than an inch taller, on average, than the generation born immediately before them (pre-1900). Two generations later, their children had grown another 3/4 inch, on average. Basically, the closer you get to "modern" (second half, 20th century) U.S. standards, the taller people get. We are now seeing Asian children in ASIA, with 20th century U.S. nutritional standards catch up in height to American children, while their parents' nutritional standards and sizes were more like (U.S.) 19th century. 

The flavonoids are potent antioxidants and therefore protect our bodies against oxidative stress; especially the oxidation of lipids, which when not prevented can lead to atherosclerotic build up in the vasculature as well. In addition, thanks to these antioxidants, "according to epidemiological evidence, garlic may have cancer-preventative properties, especially against cancers of the gastrointestinal tract." [2] Regarding Blood Pressure:

As per Medical Herbalism, "The major odor principle of garlic, allicin is produced from the amino acid alliin by the enzyme alliinase when exposed to air. In both laboratory and clinical studies, allicin has demonstrated antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antibiotic, and hypolipidemic activities. It also enhances fibrinolytic activity in the blood and inhibits platelet aggregation." [1] Garlic also contains B vitamins, minerals and flavonoids. This means that therapeutic doses of garlic will indeed have an antimicrobial effect against certain bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. What's more, the volatile oil of the garlic gets excreted through the lungs. This makes it especially useful to use for upper respiratory tract infections. Regarding Cholesterol: For the cardiovascular system, garlic can be considered a healthy tonic that is preventative against chronic heart diseases. Not only does it lower blood pressure and blood sugar, but it promotes the production of HDL, the good cholesterol, and inhibits LDL, the dangerous lipoprotein. This prevents atherosclerotic build up in the arteries. It is a blood thinner because it lowers the activity of platelet activating factor (PAF) in addition to enhancing the break down of blood clots, which prevents sudden occlusion of arteries and veins. 

Through a combination of coercion and persuasion, the Nazis managed to pass the so-called Enabling Act with the necessary two-thirds "supermajority" in the Reichstag. The key features of the Act were that with very few exceptions, "...laws of the Reich may also be enacted by the government of the Reich... Laws enacted by the Reich government shall be issued by the Chancellor [Hitler] and announced in the Reich Gazette. They shall take effect on the day following the announcement, unless they prescribe a different date." Hitler had basically given himself the power to write Germany's laws, effective one day after publication. Therefore, everything he did while Chancellor after the passage of the law (March 23, 1933) was legal, or could be made legal. 

In addition to @hdhondt's answer (+1) The evidence for the existence of Pangea lies in the existence of matches between fossil records and rock formations in continents that are now thousands of miles apart, in addition to Wegener's observation that the (continental shelves) of the existing continents match quite closely like a jigsaw. If Pangea did not exist, it becomes hard to explain how the same fossil species evolved independently on continents that were not contiguous at some point. This picture from Wikipedia illustrates the fossil evidence for Pangea quite nicely: 

Right, well lets see what the UN report actually says, here is figure 7, which shows projected world populations out as far as 2300. The range of plausible world population in 2100 is 5.5 to 14 billion. So the figure of 12 billion that appears in RCP8.5 clearly would not be considered implausible by the UN. 

I did not see anywhere on the Lady comp site, however, that cervical mucus is also documented. Lady Comp takes into account the cycle length and basal body temperature (BBT), which is quite similar to the natural family planning method of the book Taking Back your Fertility by Toni Weschler ($URL$ except the latter also observes and documents cervical fluid changes (also known as cervical mucus). To have such a high success rate in preventing pregnancy as Lady comp claims, cervical mucus must also be accounted for because different phases of the menstrual cycle correlate to different phases of cervical mucus, and this factor determines whether or not the sperm can travel up the female reproductive tract to actually reach the ovulated egg. In a study done on bovine to determine fertility properties of this mucus in mammals (2): 

Jefferson was misunderstood or misquoted. He did express his concerns in an 1820 letter to John Holmes regarding the Missouri Compromise. What worried him was not slavery, per se, but the North-South division over slavery. "I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the useless sacrifice of themselves, by the generation of ’76. to acquire self government and happiness to their country, is to be thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions of their sons." According to William Strauss and Neil Howe in "Generations,", the "generation of 1776" was much like the World War II generation, for whom politics was "played between the 40 yard lines," because they rallied around a major war. Their children, the "Transcendentals" of Emerson and Lincoln, were more like the contentious Baby Boomers that created "blue" versus "red" states. It was this "state" division, and not slavery itself, that Jefferson feared. His preferred solution for slaves was "their diffusion over a greater surface" (over all states), to lessen the burden of a solution such as a national "buyout" to set them free. But in any event, he wanted a "national" resolution, not a state-by-state one, which he (rightly) felt would divide the country. 

It took me all of five minutes of fact checking to find this out. It seems to me that Ridley is focusing on the medium scenario, in which global populations are projected to stabilize this century. However if you are going to say that something is implausible, you need to show that it is unlikely, for which you need the high and low scenarios as well. This is basically either poor scholarship or cherry picking on Ridley's part. I suspect that many of Ridleys' other claims probably don't withstand cursory fact checking either, but frankly I have better things to do, when the bias in the article is already so obvious, e.g. 

Edit: Found a corresponding figure for the 20th century. Note the spread of the model runs (which is our best estimate of the plausible variability due to the unforced response) is pretty broad. There is no good reason to expect the observed climate to lie any closer to the modern GCM ensemble mean (or indeed GCM-Q) than that. 

The math in the title of the question apears to be incorrect. This chance should be 1 in 25,000, assuming a life expectancy of 68.5 years. That is, the "average" person with such an expectancy will live 25,000 days. It also assumes that a person will have an equal chance of dying on the first day or the 25000th. But as early as the 19th century, Benjamin Gompertz worked out that mortality increases (exponentially) with age. That is, you are MUCH more likely to die on the 25000th day than on the first. $URL$ So your ACTUAL chances of dying on a given day depends on how old you are. If your are 60, your chances of dying today are greater than 1 in 25,000. And if you are 20, less. 

Just to add to @Henry's answer (+1): If you go to the NOAA webpage for downloading the data, at the top of the page it says: 

In addition to Articuno's answer (+1): Lets look at the first reason Ridley gives for RCP8.5 not being realistic: 

In addition to @hadriens good answer (+1): (i) Many forms of rock appear to have a density of about 3g/cm^3 (see e.g. here), so a density of about 3.3 g/cm^3 certainly does not imply that the moon is hollow, it could simply be made of solid rock. I would suggest that the Earth is more dense because, unlike the moon, it has an iron core (iron has a density of about 7.8 g.cm^3). (ii) The moon is not perfectly round, its polar radius is 1736.0 km, but its equitiorial radius is about 1738.1km. It is more closely spherical than the Earth, but that isn't surprising as its rotational period is about 27 days, which is much slower than that of the Earth, so the centrifugal force is lower (although so is the gravitational force, which would make it easier for the moon to become more oblate). The flattening of the Earth is 0.0033528 and that of the moon is 0.0012, so the Earth is three times more oblate than the moon, but then again it is spinning nearly thirty times faster. (iii) Apparently, some very large craters have convex floors, simply because the convexity follows the curvature of the moon, so unless some clarification is provided, this argument may simply be a misunderstanding. (iv) This is a non-sequitur from (i) to (iii) as none of those actually imply that the moon is necessarily hollow or artificial. (i) and (ii) are very weak arguments, as very basic fact checking shows that there is nothing unduly suprising in either of these "facts".
