Your question leads directly to 2 important considerations. First, whether the physical laws we discover through science are merely 'resemblances' - that they reflect but are not actual natural realities; and Second, that the laws of physics do reflect physical content or constituents themselves as it is like in nature. This in turn depends on your own metaphysical view of what is possible to be known by the human senses. The problem with the term 'Laws of Nature' that is often used in science today (or in textbooks) is that it is a misleading way of putting what in actuality are our best theories. These theories are what, after multiple tests and confirmations, verified as they are separately in experiments, are considered to be true because they give us the best results. They are not considered final. In this sense, 'Laws' as they are used, are actually tentative theories, they are not the final say in any descriptions of reality. This is because even the most well tested and described laws, such as Newton's Laws of Motion and gravitation, have limits. For instance, after Einstein, the laws do not give predictable results at high speeds or small quantities. Thus, Laws can never be Laws in our modern sense of certainty because they are incomplete. They raise further questions about physical phenomena that require further experimentation and testing. These questions are raised when we synthesize it with other laws that we know from other experiments, or from before. For example the recent discovery of the Hiigs Boson can be considered a result that has been built upon not just our knowledge of quantum mechanics, but also our understanding of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. The lack of a unifying theory does not mean that we do not understand nature. Often, we are dependent on these theories to built upon our understanding of reality and nature. It is fundamentally important then to distinguish between the metaphysical question of whether nature can really be discovered as it is by our senses, and whether there are laws of nature that are scientific theories to be discovered through experimentation, that are dependent on our senses. 

I would like to answer your question directly and succintly. First, you need to start reading a lot. Philosophy helps in that, it presents arguments that requires you to dissect those parts of the proposition, and reconsider it. Read introductory books on critical thinking, philosophy, but also expand your horizons and see what is going on in current affairs. This is because most of the fallacies are out there in the media, that often present a biased point of view, subtly or covertly. Second, discuss with people good in understanding arguments. Not just any person who is familiar with philosophy or critical thinking, because such a person may not be a good arguer, or someone who understands argument. Third, practice. With increasing practice breeds familiarity, and you will be good over time naturally. Doing nothing leads to no improvement and subsequently, nothing. 

Update: Regarding the first scenario, there is a school of thought, 'Intuitionists', who will say that instantaneous states do not lead to worser outcomes because one can consider past experiences as helpful to making decisions. 

Empirically, no. In our imaginations, yes. That is essentially what you have referred to in the conception by children from images and symbols which seem to refer to their existence. You cannot prove an ideal conception conceived purely from objects situated in reality. For one could almost conceive of any imaginary object if we put them together. Consider what David Hume says, that there is a difference between 'matters of fact' and 'relations of ideas', in Chapter 4 in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. To simplify, matters of fact are things that, no matter what word we assign to it, are true in this world because they exist. They are established by evidence, which in turn are presaged upon 'cause and effect'. Relations of ideas are when, based on certain ideas we hold in our mind, establish them to be true by the mere thought of it. This includes mathematical and geometrical ideas, but also ideas we put together from different 'matters of fact'. That is, things that we hold true from evidence. So Santa Claus is a combination of many ideas from evidence put together as an imaginary whole. The idea of a man in a red costume, with his moose and a some 'human' looking elves, are taken from real life. We distort this picture by making this man and his moose fly, jumping into the chimneys of houses, carrying a host of goods into them (even apartments without chimneys), and give him a sense of humor. This is the imaginary picture we transmit to children, through word-of-mouth and images we draw and enact, therefore to them, there is a possibility that this imaginary figure is real, given that the empirical evidence was not told to them truthfully, but turned into a festive season made real. 

As you see, it's a tough choice, where you are going to lose either the inviolability of the principle of conservation of energy, or the inviolability of deep-rooted intuitions and most philosophical traditions. All is not lost. Mathematicians and physicists can live with singularities, knowing that they are bound (at the risk of oversimplifying: without being afraid that airplanes will fall from the sky and GPS will stop working). For the rest of society, the notions of incompleteness and singularities are not palatable (hence the initial skepticism about black holes). As Richard Feynman used to say: "I don't feel frightened by not knowing things". Which is why we might get some advances from that side, rather than from other disciplines where doctrines are more radicated. As you realize the debate is not only philosophical or (anti-)religious, it is also highly political since free will and freedom of thought (in a social and political sense) are closely connected. According to the position 1 and 2, the imperative of defending freedom of speech, research, etc. might be interpreted in very different ways. With 2, it is necessary, with 1 it is contingent and conventionally accepted as merely functional. 

Fits your needs (sufficient completeness) Is the simplest you can think of (minimal number of parts => Occam's Razor) Gives you a correct (accurate, sufficiently precise) calculation/prediction according to experiment. Hopefully will not get you in some contradiction or dead ends (consistency with itself and the rest of your knowledge). 

This is a paradox (solvable, but rather undecidable at this stage), but not an aporia (logical impossibility). I would consider your model as incomplete: there is no definition of the object "wish". In particular what is the scope of the effects it can have? May a wish (effect) influence back the source (genie) or not? If yes, what are the rules and limitations? In mathematics, this comes under the heading of "feedback". In order to decide on an answer to this question, you would have to define the feedback function and see what happens to your system. It might stabilize to a definite answer (which is preferable), flip-flop to two or more answers, become wildly chaotic, go to infinity, etc.. The simplest way to solve the issue is, of course, to forbid feedback: a wish is invalid if it concerns the genie in any way, shape, or form, as well as someone else's wishes. But that would also remove the challenge in your question. The answer of gnasher 729 is not that off the mark, even though it is formulated, as it were, as a reductio ad absurdum: his implicit assumption being that the genie is omnipotent: hence not only the wish cannot affect him, but he can break it (a value of humor is that is shows absurdity). His is an acceptable axiom, though perhaps not what you intended either. But since you invented the problem, is up to you (not the genie) to give a more substance to your problem, so that it becomes decidable. 

The Hippocratic Oath is considered as a moral yardstick of the medical profession. Hence a discussion on that point would have to take it into consideration. Though it would have to be taken in its entirety, I excerpt the following parts (in its classical form): "I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice." "Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief [...]." 

This tells you how the model should look like. It doesn't tell you how to get there, except by increments (pare down and toss away elements that are not strictly necessary, add new ones that are missing, subject your model to "stress tests", by making experiments or trying to find calculation errors, inconsistencies or contradictions, etc.). Most importantly, the adjudication on what your "good" model should be, is on a case by case basis, according to the function of the model you need (e.g. *what is one trying to do with the cars? Producing them, selling them, managing a company fleet, or starting a personal collection?*...). 

Two broad reasons come to my mind. A) Reality isn't just social construction. It has to be rooted in certain facts about individual biology and environmental demands. If biology was so insignificant that we could simply brush away existing bodily differences and they'd stop mattering, couldn't we then also simply convince people that they are of a certain sex or gender (for instance the one that popular belief assigns to them)? If one's perception of sexuality and identity were free floating entities "chosen" out of will and wish, then we could just coerce likewise people into believing they were of a certain gender (or by extension, persuade them that they aren't hungry and they'd just forgo starvation ). That's the first reason. Environmental demands that the sexes were differently exposed to from an evolutionary perspective would have lead to systematic sex differences. How "relevant" they are is no doubt a matter of malleability (or plasticity) of nature, degree of systematicity in the different environments and other such complicated factors. (Not to mention that they'd be exceptions to this trend) B) Secondly you need to understand thay social conventions are created to maximise happiness. Stereotypes, howevermuch of a bad word it may be today, are rom a completely neutral perspective only statistical predicitons or trends drawn from probabilistic data about social behaviour. And for all their fallouts, they do at the end of the day help increase efficiency and happiness. Think of any group, say vegetarians. Now it might be good to offer them salad and government policies might be formulated to subsidize salads for them but it is also true that they'd be many exceptions who just despise all kind of salads. Is it unethical to stereotype them and aren't the policies unfair to those who are at odds with the majority group? And that's it: a balance has to be maintained while targeting services or behaviour or products to groups based on the increase in happiness from this targeted/focused approach and the extent to which the members of that group actually share those characterisation (i.e. the reliability of that stereotype). Now, giving scholarships to students' with high SAT scores seems justified (because the statistical trend of high scoring sat takers having proficient academic careers plays out in real life and the benefits of this "discrimination" outweigh any negative externalities). But, disadvantaging people of a certain sex or race (women and blacks for example) depending on the differences in the average intelligence level might not seem such a good idea. I'm not giving any conclusive comments on the justifiablity of these policies but the point I'm making is about the trade offs involved and how these are continuously contested themes. So to summarize: gender matters, it cannot be changed completely out of willingness or political correctness, and it in many ways is a beneficial and productive social practice. 

If reincarnation is about humans dying and their souls taking on new bodies, doesn't a net increase in human population size contradict it? (I know I'm assuming that non-human organisms do not possess souls but if they did wouldn't that sort of push moral relativism way too far? Because that'd imply non vegetarianism is tantamount to cannabalism or homicide....) {The first is the primary question though you could share views on the other one too!} 

Maybe because you happen to be? All current events are caused by antecedent conditions, so at one level of analysis you can reflect back on the vicissitudes of life that brought you here. But if you're looking for a teleological answer as to why didn't those antecedent conditions play out in a different way out of the infinite possibilities​, you are in for some serious disappointment. It is you who must first justify the assumption that there should/can/must be a higher or bigger (preplanned?) "purpose" to anything at all. 

I've always wondered if it isn't too unethical afterall to have enclosed my goldfishy in a tiny tank given her extremely small memory span. Assuming that it is shorter than the time it takes her to swim from an end to another, she never really "feels trapped", right? - especially if morality of actions affecting others (in the context of the "harm argument") is intricately linked to consciously felt emotional experiences. Otherwise wouldn't it make sense to then protect things like chairs as well (as long as sentience is what separates moral agents from material things.) Novice philosophy student here.
