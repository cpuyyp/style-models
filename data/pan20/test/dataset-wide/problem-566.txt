I always log my rides on Strava. By spending a couple minutes to set up any bike I own, they show up in a dropdown list at the end of each ride. 

The FD needs to have a firm spring, because it has to operate against the full chain load when pedalling. By comparison, the RD operates on a piece of chain under no tension, and the RD is putting the tension on that length. So you need to check the inner cable that runs from the handlebar shifter down to the FD mech. If its bright-shiny silvery then that's good, but if its dull and rusty then that's not good. A new inner cable is cheap, a little fiddly to fit, and will "bed in" over the first month of use. Second is the outers - could be someone's fitted a new inner cable but not changed the outer(s) and they're scraggy on the inside. You should be able to feel this when pulling the inner back and forth with your hands. Finally - the handlebar shifter. Its not unknown for them to clagg up with rust. They're reasonably expensive to replace. More-so if yours is integrated into your brake lever. Needs to be the same number of speeds as the rear cassette. 

I'd guess late 90s for this bike. Reasoning: The overall look of the frame is small diameter tubes, which implies steel. You can check this with a magnet. Aluminium frames of the day were rather oversized by comparison. It appears to have aluminium rims though, which is good, better for braking than steel rims. Its a rigid fork so was never intended as a hard-core MTB. The fork doesn't have a crown as such, instead the tines (legs) are welded straight to the steerer, giving it a curvy-hips look just below the headset. I can just make out mudguard/carrier mounts at the rear dropout (fender and rack) so it has commuter features. There's a quill stem, which is perfectly functional, but these days only low-end bikes have quill stems. Most have moved to threadless. The cantilever brakes will be fine once adjusted. Given the age, you'll want to consider new pads, and possibly replace the inners and outers. Canti brakes have a straddle cable which should also be replaced. Its got a wide-range triple crankset on it, where the granny chainring is about half the tooth count of the big chainring. Not a bad thing. 

Others have answered the second part "what are the differences..." Here's an answer for the first part "why not many at the dump" In in my city 2015 light grade clean steel is worth $0.02/kg. Aluminium extrusion is worth $1.83/kg. Brass like nipples is $3-$4/kg and stainless steel is about $0.90/kg. Recycling metal pays money, but I'm not going to drag a whole ton of steel there for $2 profit. So plain steel goes in the city recycling bin, and the rest goes in sorted barrels for a yearly trip to the metal man's yard. 

I would call them cable ferrules, but that same name also applies to the round cylindrical brake and gear cables like 

It's a BMX or a child's bike - built to be a single-speed because of the horizontal rear dropouts. The external cups on the headset suggest a newer bike, not a vintage. The brutish-square box section might help identify it - apparently many companies used square box, more so in the rear. Example: Redman (as an example of box section in use) 

I had this exact problem - fitted some long-reach dual pivot calipers because the bike was going from 27" to 700c wheels. The front wheel was perfect and just bolted on in. The rear caliper STILL wouldn't reach the rear wheel brake track. I checked with a ruler, it was definitely long-reach but off by ~4mm. So I made a drop plate from some scrap aluminium and two bolts. 

It now looks more like this with a 3x8 setup. The rear wheel was rebuilt onto a 8 speed freehub and I fitted am 11-32 cassette. Shifter needed replacing too, but the cable and chain was left as-is. The front chainring was replaced with a triple that I had laying about, so its 26/36/48 tooth. I did NOT change the bottom bracket at all other than a quick inspection, clean and grease. All up this gives a lowest gearing of 15 gear-inches, and a maximum of 80 gear inches. I did not change the rear derailleur mechanism. 

2.1. Since you have no front derailers, you could possibly flip the chainrings to have the big one close to the frame, and teh timing chain on the outside. Or you could even have both chainrings the same size. Its also possible, (but uncommon) to have just one big long chain doing all the drive. 

I suspect that somehow you've loosened the locknuts while disassembling, and possibly days of vibration have allowed a the nuts to migrate along the thread. Totally a guess. The fix is simply to readjust the bearings correctly, and then make sure the locknut is cinched down onto the cone to prevent movement. If your wheelset has sealed or cartridge bearings then this supposition goes out the window, and something else is wrong. 

Brifters plus quill stem suggests around 1997 or 1998 vintage. The rear brake bridge formed like a front fork, instead of two full seat stays up to the seat post... that's quite unusual. Makes the smallish frame look even smaller. I'd guess its a 7, maybe 8 speed on the rear, can't see in the photos. The front fork has relatively little rake (curve) on the legs compared to older bikes, which also suggests late 90s. That's a gorgeous bike - you should look after it and will enjoy riding it. 

You have a front-suspension mountain bike from the 90's or 2000's It is probably made from steel, based on the tube diameters. Test this with a magnet. Brake levers up on the flat bar are hard to see but seem to be metal. That's much better than plastic levers. The rear brake appears to be missing, or its lost in the photo. The front brake is a V brake and is in the wrong place relative to the braking track on the front wheel. Therefore its the wrong sized front wheel, someone's put a 27.5" wheel in a 26" wheel fork. The front suspension looks odd - a bike of that vintage would normally have rubber stanchion boots protecting the sliding surfaces. Perhaps someone has cut them off, or they may have simply perished. It appears to have pod shifters (trigger shifters) which are indexed and nicer than friction shifters. 

Pacing doesn't really come into it in a race - you keep up, or you drop off. If that means you go "into the red" on a climb then so be it - recover on the downhill, or realise you entered a race beyond your current ability. This is why its really important to know the course in a race, having either ideally ridden it before or at least had a good study of the route map via google street view or by topological maps. 

Focusing on the fork part of the question: Remember the front wheel is an OLD of 100mm (just under 4") so you will need to spread the legs/tines of the fork to give room for your changes. This means you will need a steel fork. No other material can be spread, and even a steel one might break. Consider that spreading the fork will un-align the front dropouts. They will need to be bent back to vertical too. You also require a rigid fork because this level of bending will render any suspension ineffective. 

I was toying about with a disk brake for the first time and managed to shear two bolts clean off while reassembling. Curiously, both tore the head off, leaving the threadded shaft in the tapped hole in the hub. I was able to remove the shaft using bull-nosed pliers both times. Looking closely at the remains, the head has torn off where it fastens to the shaft. Is this a weak point by design? No, I was not using a torque wrench, because I don't own one. This is high on my list of wants though. 

But records don't help where you have a bike with unknown provenance. For those you have to fire up the eye-crometer and make an educated guess. And ride it, if feasible. You can find more faults quicker in a 30 second ride than any other way. 

Something noone has mentioned is that the QR lever is not to be touching the frame or fork when in the closed position. Reasons for this are 

Answer: Salt accelerates rust of iron and steel. Any exposed metal will rust faster and sooner when exposed to salt. Even a pinhole in your paint will start turning into a rust spot where in a non-salty location it would probably be fine. With respect to chains, there's probably a bit more oil and lube on the chain than on the rest of your bike. This may have a minor protective function until it washes off. Chains are made of plain steel or less commonly stainless steel. Sometimes the plain steel chains are powder coated, but this doesn't offer any protection to the rolling contact surfaces of the chain. Stainless steel will last longer generally, but its not immune to corrosion either. Doesn't matter if its road salt that some places spray around in winter, or if its sea salt that has come from seawater or sea spray, I don't think there's a significant difference. Defence against the dark salts: 

ANSWER: on a 50:24 gear combination, with an 11 speed Shimano Alfine hub and 28-622 tyres on a 700c roadwheel, you will be doing about: 

And these are plastic ones. You'd have to clean the frame really well to ensure a good adhesion, but there's fairly low forces acting on the tube while braking - all the pressure is internalised.

Yes backpacks are not really suitable for bikes. I occasionally have to move my tools by bike, and that requires either a trailer or a tramping (hiking) pack. Sweaty, harder to see behind, and if I land on it, I'll break my back or neck. Not ideal. In your situation you want something soft and fairly well padded to protect your computer. I recommend a waterproof pannier hanging on a carrier rack, or (something) on a carrier rack, or possibly a frame bag that sits inside your main triangle. You might also get away with a larger saddle bag or an old-school handlebar bag, or even a front basket. 

The long black bit looks like a really big barrel adjuster to me. (edit not an in-line brake booster/multiplier as I originally guessed) Do you know what the original size tyre was, and what the new one is ? If you're replacing a tyre with the same width of tyre then the brakes should not need significant changes, perhaps a small adjustment for brake wear over time. If the new tyres are bigger or have a knobblier profile, then its possible they may may be rubbing on the brakes. The brake pads may be let out to allow room, but now won't close up enough before the brake lever bottoms on your handlebar, leading to poor braking. You'll be fine to fit the original size of tyre without further change. 

Obligatory "I've been there" - this particular corner has a kick, and is known for catching out both cyclists and motorcycles.
