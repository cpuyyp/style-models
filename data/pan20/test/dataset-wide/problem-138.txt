Effects will be unpredictable because of stuff floating around in the subconscious. Feeling bad about the cake you burned this morning? That healing spell just might end up cauterizing the wound instead of healing. Why magic is permanently unavailable to the scientific minds Any person that strives to be rational and scientific will suppress expressions of their subconscious, act according to established goals rather than instincts or feelings. This blocks any activation of the magic part of the brain and over the years causes it to atrophy, so that even when a scientist reverses course and tries to go all instinctive and subconscious, no magic will come of it. Any successful magic user forced into a laboratory setting will be forced to do exactly the one thing that will block his magic: think about it. Everything about the laboratory setting screams this into the magic user's brain. Even just an observing scientist in the sacred grove will trigger a blocking reaction as long as the magic user cares about that. This makes magic not "reproducible" and thus no "serious" scientist will risk their reputation on it. 

A separate digestive tract for only water/fluids with a kidney-like filtering organ connected to it. This would allow the body to extract usable water from the ingested salt water and expel the rest. Having the walls of the digestive tract develop a kidney-like function that regulates salt before it hits the bloodstream. This would likely increase the risk of infections, because kidney function depends on very delicate tissues that wouldn't do well when exposed to ingested objects or stomach acid. Extra kidneys or supercharged ones might be able to remove enough salt from the blood to maintain balance, but the tissues around the digestive tract would be exposed to much higher salt concentrations, disrupting vital processes at the slightest further increase. Rebalancing the entire body chemistry for higher salt concentrations, at which point sweet water becomes undrinkable because it will cause cells to burst when they absorb too much water. 

If after the interviews you still have human candidates left and none of the postliving candidates is clearly superior in either credentials or "experience", you'll just have to bite the bullet and wait for the next vacancy. Haha, just kidding. Tell the remaining candidates that you're setting up a challenge where they can show off their marketing skills: They'll all be put in a room and must convince the other candidates to support them for the position. Whoever gets the most votes will be in (this time). Btw, "unliving" or "non-living" are such negative terms! How about "re-living" or "non-traditionally living"? Actually, "postliving" it is! 

Let's take two small villages along the border between elf and troll lands. In the elf village, there is a school where all children learn the human and troll languages. The parents force them to practice the human language by only conversing with them in human for a month of their lives. They find troll too harsh/distasteful to speak it much. The local leader often meets with his troll counterpart, as do the traders. In this village, everyone will understand and speak a decent amount of human but despite the proximity will only be able to barely make themselves understood in troll, with only the leader and traders having a need to keep up their troll. On the other side, the troll children learn from their parents as they accompany them to work every day. The farmers, bakers, millers etc. speak only troll, since they have neither a need nor an opportunity for learning any other language. There are some exceptions: 

That is a very vague question. If by close you mean a lightyear or two, there would be little effect. If it passed inside Mars orbit, it would probably destabilize all the inner planets' orbits. If it passed between the Earth and moon, well, they wouldn't be there anymore. 

A final option may be that the people themselves are seen as more pure, making the noble sons and daughters very good prospects for foreign nobles. This would lead to many alliances and lots of political influence. Edit: A trade hub needs a good reason for different traders to converge there. Typically it's the combination of accessible location (river/sea port), local resources, industry and wealthy patrons or customers. Sadly, ABC has neither local resources nor a large cheap labour force, so it would either have to finance the trade itself or have unique highly skilled crafts that can't be moved nearer to their needed resources. It also seems unlikely that ABC is the easy road to an even more inaccessible but resource rich country, though they could have the start of the continent's main river, putting them at least at a somewhat central point. In short, ABC would to have a reason (or impose one) that traders don't just move to an easier cheaper location. 

Without sunlight, all photosynthesizing plants would die. Then all animals would die a little while later. Most fungi are dependent on the presence of energy-rich (decaying) plant matter, so they may thrive for a long time and then die out after exhausting their food source. It's unlikely that anything other than bacteria can switch their energy source to new chemical sources, leaving only a bunch of bacteria and a few isolated cave-dwelling populations. The composition of the atmosphere will change due to the rotting of all that dead stuff and the bacteria thriving on it. However, due to the lack of sunlight, this will not affect things greatly anymore. Without day and night, winds will mostly cease (no more thermals, only a slight breeze from oceans currents at most). The ice caps will slowly melt, equalizing the temperature across the globe, thus stopping most ocean currents. The planet will become very still and mostly covered by water. Over many thousands of years, the remaining bacteria will evolve to a new balance, resembling a ridiculously huge cave. If you're lucky, some of the cave-dwelling animals manage to survive on the surface and spread out a little, but most of the planet is likely too toxic for them, since they evolved in very fragile environments, and even those caves might have been dependent on oxygen-containing water coming from the surface. A few thousands to millions of years more will see rising temperatures as the heat from the planet's core slowly spreads now that the planet is not able to radiate its heat anymore. This is estimated at 43-47 Terawatts over the whole planet, both from radioactive decay inside the planet and primordial heat left over from the planet's formation. It's a tiny amount compared to the energy the Earth used to receive from the Sun, but it builds up over time. In the end, you'll have a scorching hot cave with maybe a few extremophile strains of bacteria left. 

Prevent the rise of any other armed force, in effect counter-insurgency operations. Provide assistance after large-scale disasters (Possibly) prepare to fight off an alien invasion. 

This reminds me of a recent news article about scientists proving that quantum entanglement is real even at larger distances. If it is possible to send one of a pair of entangled particles through this type of tunnel, capture it and keep it at the receiving end, you could then signal to the receiving party that they should open the white hole to receive data, by changing the "spin" of the particle in a certain sequence. Otherwise, the entangled particles would either have to be taken along by who or whatever was originally sent to set up the receiving stations, or sent after them in the same way once the technology to create and use the entangled pairs was invented. This might take many years if not included in the original mission. Small amounts of data could be transferred in binary form using just the entangled pair, and that might have been the primary communication method until the receiving stations are ready, but I suppose you'd want the black hole/white hole tunnel for bigger stuff. 

The body parts are passed down/recycled The mature robots doing specialized work require and manufacture high-performance body parts and replace pairs of limbs/parts if one of them gets damaged or degrades. These are then obtained by younger/less essential robots who refurbish them and use them, again discarding their own old parts. Servos and other components are reused in smaller parts when their performance drops, so the newly manufactured robots have to make do with those while they are "growing up" into their role in robot society. This results in immature robots having varying sizes, types and functionalities in their limbs, depending on their assignments, status, "friends" and the dumb luck of finding an awesome part. The robots also make different choices. Some may keep a matching pair of crappy limbs while others take any bigger/better limb individually, compensating for the imbalance as much as they can. Finally, the mature robots all end up human-sized with the same body plan because to deviate from compatibility would be a huge efficiency loss. So new robots are made able to use existing parts, while the mature robots do not modify themselves or manufacture parts that would be unusable for the next generation. Incremental improvements do happen, but slowly, over generations of robots.
