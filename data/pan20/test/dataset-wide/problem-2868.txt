Pattern Recognition is the ability to learn or train a system in detecting patterns. Within the field of AI, the terms "Pattern Recognition" and "Machine Learning" are used (almost) interchangeably. Sometimes Pattern Recognition is considered a subset of Machine learning, other times they are considered to be the same. So to answer your question: Pattern recognition isn't a trained ability, so much as it is itself the ability to learn and train - and we are naturally very good at this ability, because we are good at learning. At a second level your question is more interesting and falls within longstanding debate in philosophy of mind of whether we have innate knowledge or whether we start with a blank slate and learn everything from scratch. See here, here and here for more information and references. The two opposing postions are: 

Many would are argue that you are right, the demon is still successful in his deception. DesCartes claims in the cogito that he has proven the existence of an "I", since for there to be deception, there has to be thinking, and for there to be thinking there has to be an "I" that does the thinking. Hence "I think, therefore I am". Several philosophers, notably many empiricists like Locke and Hume, pointed to a major flaw in DesCartes argument, which is that all that DesCartes proves is that "thinking occurs", not that "I am thinking". Later on, Russell in his essay "Analysis of Mind", makes the analogy with rain: when we say "it rains", there's no need for a "rainer" to do the raining. Similarly, when thinking occurs, there's no need for there to be a thinker doing the thinking, the thoughts just occur. From David Hume's perspective: When we try to observe an "I" that is doing the thinking, we can't find anything. All we observe is the thoughts and emotions themselves - what we think of as the "I" is just the collection of thoughts and impressions that we have. This is known as the Bundle Theory of Self. See this post for a more detailed explanation. To recast the argument in Cartesian demonic terms: The demon is fooling you (and this "you" is just an illusion) by making you think that an "I" is necessary to do the thinking, when in fact thoughts can occur perfectly well on their own. 

This is by definition NOT Strong AI, it can only be strong AI if it has general problem solving abilities regardless of context. See this discussion for example by Hilary Putnam (it is somewhere toward the last third of the video): What distinguishes the human brain from even the most powerful current computer is that the human brain can solve problems it was not designed to solve. Assuming that human brains were programmed by evolution for specific purposes - hunting, reproducing, avoiding predators, etc ... - they are now capable of solving problems far beyond their original design, such as mathematical models for cosmology or composing and preforming symphonies, etc...you are explicitly defining an AI which doesn't do that, so it can't be Strong AI. That being said, your question in general still holds, and I will address two separate aspects of it 

Are there other positions that can be construed as being equivalent to "spiritual but not religious"? Have any academic philosophers addressed the "spiritual but not religious" position? 

There are several established and historical religions which are polytheistic. Notably, in modern times, some schools of Hinduism and Buddhism (e.g. Tibetan Buddhism), and Shintoism (the traditional religion of Japan) among others are recognized by scholars, practitioners and governments as formal religions. They all contain some elements of religion: Scripture, deities, a creation story, a set of moral rules, a priesthood, etc... 

To summarize the argument: For a person able to decide among multiple courses of action, the number of future courses of action in the real world is so large as to be practically infinite. Unless the scientist or demon was omnipotent (in which case all bets are off anyway), the simulated world/illusion that a person was experiencing would only have a limited amount of choices, and the person would realize that something was amiss. 

Laplace most famously formulated this idea in what later become know as Laplace's demon: If a super being knew everything there was to know about the universe in terms of velocities, masses and positions of each an every particle, then that being would be able to calculate all of the past events that have ever occurred and know all of the future, since there was only one possible past and one possible future per the laws of physics. Note that this position isn't compatible with current results from quantum mechanics (whether Copenhagen or MWI, or any other non-hidden variable theory). After comments from the OP, adding a second possibility (pun intended) The idea that everything that is possible exists (at some point or the other), could be a reference to Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence. Eternal Recurrence is a fairly intuitive concept once you accept the basic premise (popular in the 19th century) that time is infinite, but space is finite. Finite space implies a finite set of possible configurations of the material world. If time is infinite, then the universe will go through every possible configuration it can have, and eventually return to a configuration it has already been through before. 

I myself have wondered why I have come across so little discussion of sex among philosophers, especially since it seems to me that it would be a very serious question for ethics and philosophy of religion (i.e. why do sexual norms vary so much from society to society? Why are some religions so hung up on trying to control sexual behavior?). 

"According to new theories in modern physics the concept of matter is an illusion. Matter is just a wave. We understand materials through the curvature of the space." : No, according to modern physics (quantum mechanics, that is), matter is not a wave. Matter has both wave aspects and particle aspects. Nor does the curvature of space time have anything to do with it, that concept is from a different branch of physics, which is general relativity. In fact reconciling general relativity and quantum mechanics has been problematic for theoretical physicists. You seem to be addressing three types of questions at the same time in your post: Ontological (what is the world made of?), epistemic (are we sure about our knowledge of the world?), and axiological (does our civilization value the right things?). The ontological questions and the epistemic are related, but the axiological is outside of the scope of the question and unrelated to the other two. 

I don't think any inversion is necessary. I recall reading somewhere that Sartre's metaphysics were "surprisingly Cartesian". More to the point, DesCartes already starts from a point of existence before essence. If you follow the logic of how he arrives at his famous cogito: 

So it is not that the psychological arrow and the thermodynamic arrow of time happen to move in the same direction. They are one and the same because humans can only process information (and therefore perceive things) in the direction of increasing entropy. Here is now my question: Is Hawking here just refining Kant's idea that we perceive space and time the way we do because that's how the mind organizes our sensory input, not because that is how they really are? (i.e is my understanding of Kant correct?) 

We could then use Gödel's proof to conclude that no ethical system can be both complete and consistent: Any consistent ethical system would have to prescribe courses of action that are right, but whose righteousness we cannot prove. This wouldn't be just a mere exercise in linguistics: It would mean that any consistent set of ethics would have to rely on an outside source (Religious scripture, Social convention, evolutionary and game theoretical considerations,....) for at least some of it's rules? This is very simplistic, where are the holes in this reasoning? Can a more formal, serious version of this argument be made to show that any ethical system is inherently limited? 

Your interpretation of quantum teleportation here is incorrect: Real world quantum teleportation is limited and can't be applied to entire human bodies the way you describe. This is due to the no-cloning theorem (Wootters, William; Zurek, Wojciech (1982). "A Single Quantum Cannot be Cloned". Nature 299: 802–803. ). So the question of copying a mind using quantum teleportation is moot. 

A personal question: As an Arab-American, I try to maintain my children's ties to Arab culture and the Arabic language, going out of my way to make sure that they speak Arabic fluently, and sending them to Arabic class and attending various Arab-American community events etc...to give them a "sense of identity". But of late I have been wondering what's the point? I have Irish great grand parents from one side of my family, but it would seem silly for me to go out of my way to instill an Irish identity in my kids, or to make sure that we spoke Gaelic at home. Moreover, if one them was to marry a person of Philippino-Jewish decent, what identity are they going to instill in their offspring? Are they going to speak Tagalog on odd days, Arabic on even days, and Yiddish on Weekends? At some point it starts seeming pointless, why not just give up and adopt the dominant cultural identity of the society you live in. Moreover, it seems immoral for me to impose on them that they marry inside the group the way many groups do to their children in the name of protecting ethnic and religious heritage. On the other hand, it seems totally reasonable to me that a group which has come under sever oppression and violence (Jews, Armenians,...) or that is so small that it is in danger of extinction (Cajuns, many Native American Nations,...) would seek to protect itself by forcefully insuring the perpetuation of its language and values through its children and preventing or at least minimizing intermarriage with other groups. In addition to that, it seems that if the ideal American melting-pot model succeeds and gets extended to other geographies, in a few generations humanity will end up being one uniform, boring group with little or no cultural and genetic variation at all. Think of the number of languages that have gone extinct just in the 20th century. Some might see such a unification as a positive thing (less conflict, no sectarian strife, no racism, et....), but to me it would make for a very poor planet indeed. My questions: 

See also the noumenon/phenomenon distinction. Kant's considerations are more epistemic, while Berkeley starts with epistemic considerations, but draws ontological conclusions from them. Note that the issue of reality and its existence or not outside of the mind has been discussed for a long time, and is independent of physics theories - quantum mechanics just added fuel to the debate. For references on these questions as they relate specifically to quantum mechanics and idealism/materialism, see here and here. 

I was reading the introduction to a general philosophy text book, and it mentioned at some point that philosophy was like science in that concrete results are established and philosophers are able to build on past results and ideas. This lead me to thinking about whether philosophical issues can be resolved for good or not. My questions: 

How would Kuhn's approach avoid classifying Creationism and Lysenkoism as normal science? Shouldn't the intent of a research program count for whether it is classified as a science or not? In both Creationism and Lysenkoism's case, the program starts out with a none scientific agenda, and then tries to fit it with scientific results. It seems to me that this intention/agenda is what marks out the two as pseudo-scientific, more than anything else (that's not their only problem, but it is their biggest). 

It is fairly easy to argue that the ideas of the most notable philosophers in history (those whose names are familiar to laymen) have had effects on society beyond just their influence on other philosophers. Plato, Aristotle, DesCartes, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, have all had tangible effects on modern western society - if only by providing us with well known aphorisms. Even some lesser known thinkers (again from a laymen's point of view), such as Russell, Mill, James, have had tangible effects on modern culture. Kant is one of the greatest and most influential philosophers ever. 

This is the topic of Hofstadter's "Godel, Escher and Bach" and "I am a Strange Loop". He explicitly calls the circularity you describe a "Strange Loop". It is is strange because there is a hierarchical relationship between observer and observed, yet the top part of the hierarchy somehow connects with the bottom part. 

There can be different responses to your question, depending on which definition from the Oxford dictionary you go with. 

Most introductory texts or lectures of Nietzsche mention the connection between his thought and Nazi ideology (supposedly due to his sister's promoting his thought as being pro-Nazi). But Nazis don't get mentioned at all in similar texts regrading Hegel. For example Nazis are mentioned the Wikipedia (5 times) and SEP (4 times) articles on Nietzsche, but the Wikipedia and SEP articles on Hegel never mentions the Nazis. One has to do some more in depth research before coming across any references to Hegel being "adopted" by the Nazis. Yet listening to lectures on Hegel's philosophy, it was immediately obvious that his philosophy could be interpreted as supporting nationalism in general and German nationalism in particular. His association with romantic nationalism and German romanticism, his concept of national spirit (Volksgeist) and how the spirit of the time had "settled" on the German people, and his ideas about race seem to be very amenable to being interpreted as supporting Nazi ideology. For example in "The Philosophy of Right", he says:
