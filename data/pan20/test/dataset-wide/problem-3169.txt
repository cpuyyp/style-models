Putting aside the fact that Britain outlawed slavery in 1833, the conditions for "slavery" were not nearly as favorable in Australia as in the American south. Slavery made sense in the American South because slave labor could be turned into cash crops such as cotton, and to a lesser extent, sugar, rice or indigo. These in turn depended on trade routes to markets in Europe. The distance from Europe to Australia is a multiple (maybe twice) that of Europe to North America, meaning that this cash crop trade, and hence slavery, would not be nearly as profitable. Also, the Australian aborgines would not have made as good slaves as Africans, if for no other reason that it would have been easier for them to escape to their homeland (the "rest" of Australia), whereas the Africans were separated from their homeland by the Atlantic Ocean. Instances of enslaved Africans trying to return to Africa on e.g. the Amistad, were so rare as to be the stuff of legend. 

I agree that the above was the only battle between two submerged submarines. More to the point, I'd be surprised if there was ever a battle between two SURFACED submarines. BY DEFINITION, submarines do not like to fight on the surface. They are small ships with no guns (to speak of), and are therefore not a match for a warship when surfaced. Their primary weapon is torpedoes, and ships armed with torpedoes are basically at a severe disadvantage against ships armed with larger guns than their own. (This is true for destroyers and cruisers as well as subs.) The reason subs are used at all is because they can attack with torpedoes from underwater, where large ships like battleships cannot effectively retaliate. The best "subchasers" are small, fast surface ships like destroyers and corvettes. Their weapon of choice during World War II were "depth charges," strings of explosives set to explode at varying depths, thereby "chasing" a submarine down. Subs are too small to carry many such charges, and too slow to use them effectively. The Venturer had only eight torpedoes (basically, one "string") when it attacked the German sub, and was lucky to sink it. That's why such actions are so rare. And knowing this, naval commands would seldom use a sub to chase another sub. 

When the Americans landed at Salerno, loudspeakers blared out in the best Hollywood style, "Come out with you're hands up. We've got you covered." Not spies, exactly, but certainly "voices." The Americans refused to surrender, and won the battle. 

In "Gulag Archipelago," Alexander Solzhenitsyn made the point that the Soviet Union tried to attract its "citizens" living in Europe to return to the Soviet Union by playing on their homesickness. Once returned, they were imprisoned in Siberia to prevent them from "contaminating" ordinary Russians (by telling stories of a better life abroad). More to the point, Stalin wanted to neutralize these people for fear that they would form the core of a new "white" (anti-Communist) movement, even though the "whites" had already been defeated in Civil War, ridiculous as this may seem to us. Remember that this is the same Stalin who slaughtered his own generals out of paranoia. AT Yalta, Stalin asked for and won British and American acceptance for the repatriation of Russian solders serving with the Germans (Operation Keelhaul), and Russian "Cossack" civilians. The former group was mostly executed, the latter group imprisoned. Again, Stalin wanted to destroy these potential "whites." Basically, any Russian who had managed to leave Russia before it became the Soviet Union would do well to stay away if at all possible. The people who had the best chance of doing this were those that became "naturalized" citizens of other countries. 

Germany was fortunate to have a large batch of officers born in the 1890s. These included Rommel, Doenitz, Paulus, Richtofen, Zeitzler, and Dietl. Important "exceptions" such as von Manstein and Guderian were born just a few years earlier, in the late 1880s. In this context, it was important to note that Germany's "maximum leader," Adolf Hitler, was born in 1889, which is to say that these generals were appointed by a "peer." This was known as the "Lost generation," which more than others, had to rely on its own resources. The reason the 1890s "vintage" was so important was because these men spent their (key) fortysomething age brackets during the 1930s, that is the Global Depression, before ripening into generals around age 50 in the 1940s. These hard economic times shaped an "edgier," more resourceful, more cunning group of officers than the ones that came just before and after them. This was particularly true in Germany, which suffered the double whammy of the depression and the restrictions imposed by the Versailles Treaty. Also, they were much more conversant in the "new" technologies of tanks, airplanes, and self-propelled artillery than older generals of other armies. America was fortunate to have a number of generals born in the 1890s; Dwight Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, and Mark Clark, who were more adaptable to modern war conditions than older generals such as Patton. These generals were headed by a President (FDR) born in 1882, which may be why there were fewer "1890s"-vintage American generals than Germans. Britain's commanders (Wavell, Auchinleck, Gort, Montgomery were mostly born in the early to mid-1880s, which is to say in a less timely fashion than the Germans. It is noteworthy that their leader was Winston Churchill, born 1874, who did not appoint brilliant later commanders such as Jock Campbell (born 1894) to senior command. The French were in the worst shape. Their only general of note born in the 1890s was Charles deGaulle, and he was only a brigadier. Spots ahead of him were occupied by the likes of Generals Gamelin and Weygand, born in the 1860s and 1870s, the right age for World War I (but not II). There is a fear that today's hard economic times is creating an edgy, hungry, and cunning new "Lost" generation of young adults born in the 1980s and 1990s. (Some would say that the "New Lost" goes back to the 1970s). If there is a major war in the late 2020s, 2030s, or early 2040s, this generation will likely produce the sharpest generals we've seem in modern times; otherwise, they'll become generals of finance, technology, or "cyberwars." 

The passage means that if you want a fight, you should not meet the enemy on his side of a river which he needs to cross. The reason is fairly obvious. You should wait for him to cross first, and fight on your side of the river with his back to the water. If you win, you will destroy him. Better yet, you should wait until he has crossed the river with half his force (so that he has passed "the point of no return") and then divide and conquer. 

Maybe another way of putting it was that the U.S. tried to "capitalize" on discord between Russia and China. The U.S. supported China during the Sino-Vietnamese "war" of 1979,by establishing an Embassy in Beijing during the war. Also, after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in the early 1980s, the U.S. sent weapons such as "stinger" missiles to the Afghanis, which pleased the Chinese, because they were allied with the Pakistanis against the Soviets (and Indians).
