Indeed, when premises contradict, any conclusion (even a false one) is true. This is due to the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet): 

If A says that B is true, but B is not true, then A cannot be speaking the truth (whether that is intentionally or not is a different question). This works the same way with questioning if B is true: this allows for B to be false with some probability, and in that case A is not speaking the truth with the same probability. This of course doesn't mean that A never speaks the truth. However, it is not uncommon to think that when someone has made many false claims in the past, he will continue to do so in the present and future. Still, the past strictly doesn't give any guarantee for the future. So, questioning something someone claims to be true, is implicitly also questioning that person in the sense that the probability other things he claims are false has increased, and have thus become "more questioned". 

Drunkenness has both subjective and objective aspects. The subjective aspect is the altered state of consciousness. On the other hand, the presence of certain amount of alcohol in blood plasma, or being unable to walk on a straight line are the objective aspects. Now is the statement "I'm drunk" subjective or objective? Drunkenness is a simple example. However, if we accept physicalism, or more specifically the idea that every conscious experience is related to a unique pattern in the brain, can we conclude that all statements are somehow objective? 

This argument is valid since it has the same form as the abstract argument above. However, as it turns out, it's not raining (the second premise is false). Moreover, I am not eating a cat at this moment. Hence, the conclusion is false while the argument is valid3. Validity is often confused with soundness: 

If you translate an "if ... then ..." construction into propositional logic, you get something of the form P → Q. Recall the truth table of material implication: 

It is in the name that a necessary condition has to be true for the consequent (smog) to be true. So, if you have ten necessary conditions, they all have to be true. Therefore, if one is not true, the consequent is not true. And in that case, you can rewrite n necessary conditions E → N1, E → N2, ..., E → Nn to one necessary condition E → (N1 ∧ N2 ∧ ... ∧ Nn). It then becomes clear that if one Ni is false, E has to be false as well. So, your error was to write "Chemical 1 ∨ Chemical 2 ∨ ...", i.e. to use ∨ instead of ∧. 

There are many obvious examples for 1 and 2. It seems to me that 3 is impossible. My question: Is 4 possible? If so, please provide an example. Update: I have edited the question. In the previous version, I asked about two examples: A. Bob is prettier than Charlie B. Alice believes that Bob is prettier than Charlie 

A: All bachelors are unmarried B: Water is liquid We all agree that A is analytic. To prove its truth, we only need to replace "bachelor" with its definition. The proposition B can be controversial, depending on whether we include liquidity of water in its definition or not. Now here we encounter a problem: How much knowledge should we include in definitions? Some extremist may attach any new knowledge about water to its definition. They will come up with a very long definition of water, but any statement about water will be analytic to them. 

A sufficient condition S for event E has the form S → E. A necessary condition N takes the form E → N. If you want to make sure E happens, make sure one of its sufficient conditions is true, because then S → E ensures E. Using modus tollens it also follows that ¬N → ¬E. So if you don't want E to happen, make sure one of its necessary conditions is false. 

There are two other formulations, but here, especially the first formulation is interesting. On wikipedia, the universability test, a method to determine whether or not your maxim can be one of those of the categorial imperative, is described. Let's imagine a world in which the maxim as we defined it is a universal law. Therefore, everyone necessarily acts according to this maxim. Do we find a problem here? No, rather the opposite: If everyone would act according to a maxim as "act such that your actions will diverge inequalities in wealth between all people as much as possible", the world becomes terribly unstable. First of all, this will create one group very rich people and one group very poor people. However, in the end the rich people will need the poor to be richer in order to get richer themselves (to sell things, to produce more, etc.) So in the end we can't diverge anymore. Any action to make the rich richer will need the poor to be richer as well; any action to make the poor poorer will need the rich to be poorer as well. We're running into a state in which the maxim doesn't really have any effect anymore: a final state, in which people can't really follow the maxim to its end anymore. The question is whether this final state is desirable. Secondly, imagine some kind of natural disaster, somewhere along the way to this final state. A big flood comes, destroys everything of the rich, making them poorer than the poor. Following the maxim, the 'old poor' will now become richer and richer, while the 'old rich' become poorer and poorer. This demands adaptability from us, the humans in the world, an adaptability that we don't really have. So a world in which the opposite of our maxim is a universal law, isn't desirable. Kant doesn't say that from this follows that the maxim itself should be a universal law, but it could be argued with his help. Nietzsche The immoralist. He didn't really formulate his own ethics, but had lots of criticism on others. He argued that 'God is dead', meaning that we don't have any moral framework anymore, and that we're "plunging continually": 

What are the criteria for existence, i.e. the answer to "what exists and what doesn't exist?" in modern schools of philosophy? My trial: Something exists if and only if it can affect our senses, either directly or indirectly. For example, magnetic fields or electrons exist, because they affect our measuring devices, which we can see. Update 1: There are at least two challenges for this criterion: 

Update 2: Another approach: We need to accept the existence of at least one object as a reference (let's say our hands), which is followed by two rules: A: Anything observed to have interactions with existent objects is also existent. B: Anything whose existence is consistent with our knowledge probably exists. I think the circularity of this definition is resolvable, but I admit it's vague. 

I haven't read it myself, but this book was mentioned in an introductory course on robotics on the Radboud University in the Netherlands (I am a student computing science, so this may be just relevant for you as well): 

Consider splitting a set in two based, one subset of which the elements satisfy the predicate, and one subset of which the elements don't satisfy the predicate. If the predicate is stronger, the Yes-set will be smaller ("the stronger the restriction, the narrower the class"). Therefore, the No-set will be bigger. And since it works both ways, this means that the negation of the predicate is now weaker. This does not only work for predicates that become stronger or weaker. If we have a strong predicate, that means the Yes-set is small. Since the No-set is the complement of the Yes-set, it has to be big, and therefore the negation of the original predicate (that is, the predicate of the No-set) has to be weak. 

There is a predictor [who is never wrong], a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following: Box A is clear, and always contains a visible $1,000. Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor: If the predictor has predicted the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing. If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000. I'm a fan of "only B decision". But just before acting my decision, I will face the following problem: ...I know my decision Is B. So I know B is filled. I know if I know B is filled, then my decision is A+B. So I know my decision is A+B. In order to have B as my final decision, I must choose to know the "I know my decision Is B" statement and reject to know the "I know if I know B is filled, then my decision is A+B" statement. Now the problem is, can we choose to know or not know something? I found this interesting problem here, which is quite relevant: Imagine you're stranded on a desert island, dying of hunger and thirst. A man in a rowboat happens to paddle by, and offers to transport you back to shore, if you promise to give him $1000 once you get there. But take heed: this man is extremely psychologically astute, and if you lie to him, he'll almost certainly be able to read it in your face. In order to survive, I must choose to know my future decision. 

There is some anachronicity here. The Bible story Kierkegaard is referring to is Genesis 22 (the binding of Isaac). What has happened until then is the following: 

I'm just going to give you the general way to solve these kinds of problems, as this looks like a homework question. Since there are no common variables between the expression "Q ∧ R" and "¬(¬¬¬P ∨ P)", you can only proof the causality by proving that the latter is necessarily false. From something untrue anything follows. This is called ex falso (sequitur) quodlibet.
