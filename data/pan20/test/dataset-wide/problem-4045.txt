This isn't my research group (though some of the people for whom it is are around), but here's a website devoted to this stuff, with lots of papers, names, etc. It's a VERY active area, with a lot of interesting problems. 

So, not what you're looking for, but closely related. A nodal cubic threefold's Fano surface is isomorphic to $S^2B/\sim$ where $B\in\mathcal{M}_4$ is nonhyperelliptic, and $\sim$ is constructed as follows: Let $L,L'$ be the two $g^1_3$'s on $B$, then they give maps $B\to S^2B$ by $r\mapsto p+q$ if $p+q+r$ is in the $g^1_3$. Then identify these two copies of $B$ in the natural way. So, not numerical invariants, but $F(X)$ deforms to this singular surface, so you can read off quite a few pieces of data from it. A reference to this is Donagi's "Fibers of the Prym Map" section 5.4 but I'm sure it appeared somewhere else earlier, I just don't have that reference on hand. 

Don't need stable. It's the stack of all G bundles on a curve. The right hand side is the derived category of local systems, which are vector bundles with flat connection (G-bundles, for the Langlands dual of G in this equation). As for background, that depends on how deep an understanding you want. For a lot of the positive characteristic stuff, you want to look at stuff by Frenkel and Gaitsgory, is my understanding. In the complex case, there's a bit of other stuff. I've got to, of course, recommend the work of my advisor, as well as the work of Witten which is closely related. To really get this, you need to have a bit of an understanding of the Hitchin system on Higgs bundles (though not by that name, they're used extensively in this paper). As for why it's called Geometric Langlands, that'd be because it's, essentially, a geometric formulation related to the classical Langlands conjecture in number theory, which I know fairly little about, except that it involves automorphic forms. I recommend asking your local number theorist for some help, though I do believe that it is explained in the book Introduction to the Langlands Program by quite a few authors, which includes Gaitsgory explaining roughly what Geometric Langlands is and how it all fits together. Hope that helps. 

Although to you, category theory is merely an inefficient framework for data about logic and programming languages, to mathematicians working in areas like algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, categories are truly essential. For us, some of our most basic notions make no sense and look extremely awkward (in fact, some of them are from pre-category days, and no one really knew what we wanted intuitively until after we started using categories) until you phrase them in terms of categories and universal properties of objects and morphisms (and 2-morphisms, etc). Additionally, it helps us tell what various types of mathematical objects have in common, and how they relate via functors and natural transformations. As far as recasting algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in terms of lambda calculus, I'd rather like to see that if anyone can manage to, say, give an alternative definition of stack or gerbe or model structure which are more intuitive without using categories and groupoids and the like. 

Let k be an algebraically closed field. It's well known that every complete curve, period, is projective. Also, that every smooth surface is, and that there are smooth 3-folds which are not, and people go to reasonable lengths to include these examples all over the place, so they're easy to find. However, Hartshorne does say that singular complete surfaces are not all projective. Is there a simple example? A complete normal surface that is not projective? Is there some "least singular" possible such surface? I suspect that normality is too much to hope for, but I can't quite phrase why I think this, so is every normal complete surface projective? 

I'd say that the really fundamental issue is that the two theories have such different flavors that it's impossible to come up with an interpolation. General Relativity is about Lorentzian manifolds, so the objects are smooth, and the geometry is paramount to understanding the physics. On the other hand, although to do quantum mechanics does require vector bundles (or more generally, principal $G$-bundles for $G=SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ in particular) the study of these things is fundamentally rooted in discrete objects: the root, weight and character lattices of lie groups, which are where charges live, the collection of Feynman diagrams for a theory, are very much combinatorial. One thing bearing this out is that two of the most well known attempts at quantum gravity work very hard to interpolate between these: in string theory, instead of looking at graphs, you have Riemann surfaces, which in some sense smooths everything out to be more like relativity, but in loop quantum gravity, you end up with discrete spacetime, and I've heard people talk about things like "Smooth discrete spaces" which I know absolutely nothing about, but which seem like a decent candidate for the cosmos in quantum gravity. 

Here's a blog post I wrote, based on Georgi's book. The example is solving for the normal modes of oscillation of a system of identical masses and identical springs. More generally, you can use the automorphism group of the graph they form to do it for more complicated configurations. 

You can start with these notes by Vistoli, which talk about that stuff in the direction of doing stacks and descent theory. The other articles in FGA explained might be useful, as they do a lot of moduli space construction (ie, prove that a given functor is representable). Another place to look would be in Eisenbud and Harris's "Geometry of Schemes" where they characterize schemes among sheaves on CommRing, towards the end of the book. 

No, they cannot. Note that $exp(PAP^{-1})=Pexp(A)P^{-1}$, so wlog, both are in Jordan form. Then, we can compute by exponentiating Jordan blocks, and the first will have a two by two block (or two one by one) depending on whether it is diagonal or not $\delta=0,1$, and three $exp(\lambda_2)$ eigenvalus. The second has a 3 by 3 block and two $exp(\lambda_2)$ eigenvalues. These will exponentiate to new Jordan blocks for the eigenvalus $exp(\lambda_1)$, and so the two matrices have different spectra, and so cannot be the same. 

Should be able to use Groebner bases and elimination theory to do it, I think. Though in the case of linear and quadratic equations, I'm not sure how much help it will be. 

Well, there's Witten. He got his degree in history, then attempted to be a political journalist and get a grad degree in econ before looking into physics and math, but got the Fields Medal. 

It's hard to say anything about fundamental groups of complex projective varieties that isn't also true about compact Kahler manifolds. Perhaps the proof should focus on using the Kahler structure, when you're working on these. Want to parameterize subvarieties of a projective variety? Tough, it doesn't work. SubSCHEMES, however, gives the Hilbert Scheme. Proving things about ideals is often easier to do with modules in general 

Adding it so that it's easily found. The thing I was looking for, which is generally not written out except in the case of vector bundles, is that the sheaf of sections of an F-bundle with fiber F is a sheaf of sets that is locally isomorphic in the etale topology to the sheaf hom(-,F) ranging over small enough open subsets of X. 

I have to follow Alberto's answer with Deligne and Mumford's paper on irreducibility of the moduli of curves. 

Not the cleanest answer (if it's too messy to follow, I can clean it up a bit) but look at section 2.4 (starting on page 14) of these notes from a complex algebraic geometry course that I took. Also, section/chapter 6 on page 33 picks up the thread after some diversions about curves. But roughly, the cohomology (specifically, the Hodge decomposition) depends only on the Jacobian Ideal. 

Every time that I've taught someone what a vector space is, I first spent some time on what a field is, including examples of finite fields. It's rather hard for someone to claim you can take the real and imaginary part of a vector if you say "Ahh, but the field I'm thinking of is $\mathbb{F}_2$, so what does that mean?" It's always seemed to help with what a vector space is to first see what a field is, and get some experience manipulating axioms that are more familiar. 

Well, that's a function $\mathbb Q\times\mathbb Q\to \mathbb Q_{\geq 0}$. However, it is the same as a function $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, by continuity, and so by Hilbert's 17th Problem, it's a sum of squares of rational functions (with real coefficients, but I'm willing to be that we can do it over $\mathbb{Q}$ as well). 

Now, I don't want any projectivity hypotheses here, and I'm curious, with the more arithmetically inclined, is this still true over an arbitrary field? 

You want concrete? Then you want curves and surfaces! Check out Chapter V of Miranda's "Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces" to see lots of stuff about divisors, how they're made up of functions, how they can give maps to projective space, etc. As for how to choose a pencil, that's just choosing two divisors that are linearly equivalent, and taking linear combinations. For surfaces, you'll want Beauville's book "Complex Algebraic Surfaces" which does surface theory without schemes, over $\mathbb{C}$. 

Well, for 3, it'd be all of them (well, at most one of them is empty, by Big Picard). The zeta function is meromorphic, but not rational, and so has an essential singularity, at infinity. 

Well, couldn't you use the fibration \Omega G\to PG\to G, note that PG is always contractible, and use the spectral sequence of a fibration? You know the cohomology of PG and G from contractibility and from the lie algebra, and then you just need to do the spectral sequence yoga to compute it for \Omega G. 

And actually, as a partial answer to my own question, I just stumbled across Schubert's "Kalkul" on Google Books, and it looks complete, which makes me rather happy, though other portions of the question still stand. EDIT: A friend of mine has informed me that Zeuthen's "Lehrbuch" is also there, and now it's linked. 

The most useful thing here for your interests would probably be log geometry, from what I know. In one formulation (Matsuki "Introduction to the Mori Program" is my reference) you look at pairs $(X,D)$ where $X$ is a projective variety and $D$ is a divisor on $X$ with normal crossings. Then look at the category of these pairs called log pairs, and the geometry captures a lot of the geometry of $X\setminus D$. Here's the book, check out chapter 2, hope it helps. 

A sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ doesn't just come with topological support on a scheme. If you look at the definition of support (Which should be available in any good book, none of which I have at hand at the moment) it should describe to you that the support is a subscheme of the ambient scheme, not just a subspace, and may really have non-variety structure on it. 

So, I feel like I'm missing something obvious, but I have the following situation: Let $X\to Y$ be a finite group quotient of schemes (in fact, varieties) by the finite group $G$. Let $\tilde{Y}\to Y$ be any resolution of singularities. Then we have a natural map $X\times_Y \tilde{Y}\to X$ which is birational, and $X\times_Y \tilde{Y}\to \tilde{Y}$ is a quotient by $G$. I want to be able to say that $X\times_Y \tilde{Y}$ is a resolution of $X$, and if $G$ acts freely, I can see how. But what if there's a locus (let's say a divisor) where $G$'s action has stabilizers? EDIT: I'm leaving the above, though that situation is no good, thanks to comments below and abx's answer. But perhaps this is more reasonable: Given $X\to Y$ a quotient by $G$ a finite group and $\tilde{Y}\to Y$ a resolution of $Y$, can I always find a resolution $\tilde{X}\to X$ such that $G$ acts on $\tilde{X}$ and $\tilde{X}/G\cong \tilde{Y}$? 

For a very non-Lie Theoretic reason to care about the ADE root systems, look at $URL$ and do exercise 66 on DuVal singularities of surfaces. It's good to do by hand if you need practice with blowups, otherwise, just looking at the fact that you get ADE out of canonical surface singularities should motivate the need for Dynkin diagrams, which describe the root systems.
