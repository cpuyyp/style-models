One way is to stop thinking of Magic as "Science only better": It's not a simple (or even complex) set of reproducible rules, causes and effects. It exists at the whim of the gods. It takes a combination of concentration, knowledge, instinct, will, creativity from the mage to produce a spell. Why can he produce a fireball and throw it at an enemy, but not boil his brain? Not even the mage himself (or perhaps even the author/narrator!) knows. All he knows is one is relatively easy (or allows room for error) and the other is difficult. It's a very mysterious art. And as the effects become more complex or powerful, the spell becomes more difficult. Asking an army to step through a teleportal is a big request if they know that the more people that step through, the stronger the spell has to be, and the stronger the spell is, the more concentration and skill is needed from the mage, and if it goes wrong, they could end up trapped in a deep cavern for the rest of their lives, or teleported into solid rock, or their bodies just mangled or never rematerialising. 

He uses his wits! He's not strong enough to fight and defeat the monsters in the first chapter, but he may be smart enough to set traps (or have/make friends who are) or trick them in some way. Of course it may take him some time to figure out that he needs to do this, and more time for the opportunity to spring the trap, hence he can't defeat them straight away... Just be careful not to fall into the common trap where at the climax, to increase the tension, the monster doesn't get caught by his subterfuge and he ends up having to fight him mano-a-mano anyway and by a miracle manages to defeat the monster.... Which of course would undo all your work to show he was "under average" 

A lot of technological development since then was motivated by the Cold War. If that could be averted, then you may well avoid or at least severely slow development of space technology, advanced weapons, jet-powered flight, computers, etc. Perhaps the best way to avoid that would for communism not to have taken hold in Russia, but have Russia still well able to stand up to Germany in WWII. Doing away with the revolution altogether might be required. Care is needed though - without the revolution, do Russia still withdraw from WWI? If not, then is Germany beaten more decisively and how does that affect Hitler's rise to power? 

For spaceships from Earth, computer navigation technology would make any form of jousting or even combat with ranges close enough to see your target completely redundant. However, perhaps an alien species that has highly advanced space-travel technology but very primitive computer technology might use jousting as a means of fighting effectively - if your missile can only fly bullet-like in a straight line, then a tactic would be approaching from the direction of their nose getting as close as possible, to minimise the effect of your bullet taking time to get to them and them not being where they were when you pulled the trigger. Having said that it might be only useful against inexperienced impetuous enemies. An experienced pilot would recognise when you have the advantage over them and just steer away, calling off the joust. 

I don't think the "reality-check" tag is appropriate here because of course there's nothing realistic about moving faster than light anyway. So the answer must ignore all the relativistic stuff that happens as they approach the speed of light, and just regard light as an energy transfer with a limited speed (like sound) First of all, they could not see anything behind them, because they're outrunning its light. So what happens if they look backwards? Complete darkness. Secondly, there would be severe doppler-effect type issues for seeing anything in front of them, so depending on how fast they're going, visible light might well be increased to a frequency that is outside the visible spectrum, and infra-red is now in the visible spectrum. But the key here is that all this is happening through evolution. Evolution is a gradual process, so as they evolve the ability to move at higher speeds, they must also evolve the vision sense to see light frequencies higher than we can, as well as process information at the higher speeds - otherwise the high speed ability would be useless, cause them to kill themselves by crashing into things and therefore they would be removed from the gene pool, and the faster than light evolution would have never taken hold. That being the case, they are most likely evolving the ability to see each other while moving at FTL speed, even though the light itself would form nothing like their shape as we think of it, their brains would have evolved to reprocess the information into the correct shape so what they would "see" would a correct image. (Similar to how our brains process the two separate images from our two eyes into a single 3-D image) Of course they will only ever be able to see within a limited field of vision in front of them. The light from outside that field simply isn't reaching them. 

Why not just make the hull bulletproof? It probably has to be anyway to survive the super-high speed grains of space pebbles whizzing about... As to why they don't just make body armour out of the same stuff? Simple: it's too heavy or has to be too thick to wear. Even if they do, body armour has moving parts and therefore chinks. Or, the ship has an automated system that can quickly plug/patch small holes in the hull. 

On Earth, there are geothermal vents - heat coming from underground vents that support life at the bottom of the ocean where the sun cannot reach. My question is, would this be possible to support life in the atmosphere of a planet as the only source of heat? I'm thinking of a planet with these vents dotted around the surface like oases, each one surrounded by teeming life (even if it's just basic vegetation or very simple animal life) in an otherwise cold and barren landscape. Further to this, could they support a small communities? People didn't necessarily evolve there (perhaps space-travelling colonists crash-landed there or something). There are one or more stars close enough to provide a twilight level of light but no heat. (Think outer planets) though the people, while as close to being human as possible, may have somehow superior or different vision to ours (e.g. different visible frequencies) so they'd be able to see just fine. The atmosphere would have a safe level of oxygen & other gasses so it could be breathed by human-like creatures and the indigenous life. My question is, is this possible? What are the major drawbacks to this that would make it implausible and how can they be overcome (naturally, not with technology)? e.g. ... 

If your story starts off 100 years from now, it's possible that by the time it begins, some more Voyager-like probes have been sent off into space, maybe some with transmitters a lot more powerful than Voyager / Voyager II. Your protagonists pick up a weak signal from one of them, but the signal comes from where it will be in 20 million years! 

It depends on how much "artistic license" you're taking with physics... you already have an alien traveling faster than light... Maybe your telescope isn't a simple optical telescope and either somehow "sucks" the light from the alien planet (to get around MozerShmozer's huge telescope problem) faster than c, or uses technology similar to what the alien used to get here to send information from there to here faster than light. Perhaps the telescope can detect tachyons (hypothetical super-light-speed particles) coming from the planet or something... 

They like to curl up so that's a good start. Let's say they virtually never lie out flat to sleep, this would eliminate the need for length in beds. Secondly, they are very small and light, compared to humans, so there isn't the same need for support / tension that we have in spring-type mattresses, not to mention the height. And with large families, you need to be able to make a lot of them quickly, so the simpler the design the better. So, with all that in mind, a bed is just a loop of tough fabric, which is filled with soft stuff (foam / straw / hay / whatever). And what is the most natural state for a loop? A circle! At least, that might be the history of beds, nowadays it's become so traditional that that's just the shape of their beds. Rectangular beds? Leave that to the Austin Powers type characters... 

18 years ago, an incredibly hardy and contagious but slow-acting disease spread throughout the world. The germ buries deep in the liver (or maybe brain!), making its eradication pretty much impossible without destroying the liver. Having no immeadiate symptoms, it wasn't detected before pretty much everyone on Earth had caught it. This disease must incubate for about 18 years before it wakes up and kills a person. A vaccine was developed as soon as it was discovered - a cheap and simple vaccine that could be easily distributed to the peoples of the world. The only problem is: The vaccine is only effective on unborn babies still in the womb! 

I disagree with most of the answers here. I think there would be very little effect because of the price. I don't even think it would increase the gap between rich and poor. At that price, I think almost no one would buy it regularly. It would be a luxury item. Even upper class people would think twice before spending $1,000 a week on it, because even if you can afford it , it's still a fine chunk of money, can you not think of something more fun or productive to spend it on? Its most important contribution to society would be its leisure applications e.g. it could be an occasional treat, e.g. so people could attend week-long parties, or perhaps on "adult" holidays with all-night activities. Even if you earn enough per hour that the ability to do the extra work would pay for it, would you want to? The $21 per hour that Nathaniel mentions is just to break even, in other words, working for free. You'd want to be paid double that to actually make it worth your while (more than double, in fact, to cope with the extra tax you're now paying, presumably it's not tax deductable), and I think your company would just prefer hire a second person to do the night shift. The same goes for the military. Furthermore you don't mention whether it fights off tiredness for reasons other than lack of sleep. You might be tired after 16 hours of work, not because you didn't get enough sleep, but because you've been doing 16 hours of work every day (or even just for the last few days). So the extra 8 hours you're doing every day is not as valuable as the 8 hours of a normal day, and you're tired and pissed off... The only people I see using it for work are people in really high pressure jobs (like CEOs and national leaders) or the occasional push for a looming deadline. 

If you arrive at a distant planet you mean to colonise, without enough food for the long term - just maybe a couple of plants and a bunch of seeds and enough food in storage to keep you going for the time being, could you develop that into a farm to feed a large population over time using hydroponics, or any other real / theoretical / hypothetical methods? (How large doesn't matter, it's the possibility of expansion that I'm asking about) The planet doesn't have much in the way of organic material or soil, it's a rocky and icy wasteland (It does have water and oxygen). If not, what is the minimum of other basic chemicals / elements that could hopefully be extracted from the planet that would be required? 

Have the door open out As in, you have to pull the door to open. If there is no pressure on the other side, you won't be able to / it will be very difficult to open the door, or you'll be able to open it a little before it's quickly sucked closed again. 

The spell book itself is magic, and actually contains some of the magic (if we could quantify that somehow) for the spell. To put two spells into one book would cause their respective magical fields to intermingle and taint each other. Best case scenario, they ruin each others' purity and the spells become less efficient / effective, at worst, they can't be compatible with one another, and rupture the fabric of reality around the book perhaps causing minor accidents (bursting into flames or corroding the things around them or something). The covers of the books contain special magical insulation to keep the magic from leaking out. That only leaves the matter of the content required to fill an entire book. You could use one of the other suggestions above, or maybe the spell doesn't need the entire book - the rest of the content is just the ramblings of the wizard who created the spell, interesting facts, perhaps the theory which lead to how the spell was created, etc. We've to create an entire book anyway we might as well put something in there. So doing this might have become a tradition, respected by those nerdy intellectual wizards... 

I imagine a society where most people join the army as soon as they leave school, remain for 5 years and then move onto their actual desired profession, which would result in a very youthful army (17-21 year olds), and a very small tax base into the future. Presumably you get paid while you're in the army, so I wouldn't see too much of a problem with career soldiers - some of them may like it and stay on just as they do in real life. 

With many religions it would help! Aren't heaven and hell held to be in sort of parallel universes? (e.g. you can't dig to hell, or fly a rocket to heaven) The religious people would simply say, "Yes I know, we've been telling you that for years!" 

The particular adults who don't believe in him were naughty kids themselves and so never got presents. They now buy presents for their kids (since they don't believe) so Santa doesn't need to. Two lots of toys would just be spoiling them... 

What I'm trying to figure out is what the limit is before actually moving some of the population to another planet becomes a desirable alternative, but assuming that by the time we have the technology to do that, we also have the technology to resolve our resource issues. 

There are plenty of reasons to stay. First and foremost though, they have a home, be it a house, apartment, shanty hut. They might even have running water and electricity. Furthermore most people there are city folk, and haven't a clue how to be self sufficient. As bad as the city is, there is probably still a place to get food. If there is a school for the kids, they don't want to risk their education by leaving. If not, then maybe they are so poorly educated that they don't know what they will find once they leave, or where they should go. As o.m. stated in his answer, all the family and relations live here, and people don't wish to abandon them (or be separated from them) If the city is isolated as you say, the situation is probably the same for all citizens. And with the bad infrastructure, there are no decent roads or transport methods to get out of there, and as such not only would it make leaving more difficult, but it would also mean visiting other places would be difficult - this means that there would be a reduced likelihood that people would even see other places and be inspired to move for a better life. You could introduce more fantastical elements depending on the genre of your work. e.g. The city's people as a whole have an inherent fear of the dark or maybe believe that vampires/ghouls/etc. lurk in the protection of dark outside the city, but the city itself is well lit at night. (Obviously the mines were well lit when they were open!)
