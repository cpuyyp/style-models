See final remark of "SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE WEAK CONTAINMENT PROPERTY FOR GROUPOIDS AND SEMIGROUPS" by Claire Anantharaman-Delaroche for an affirmative answer of the question. $URL$ 

Let $G$ be a non-amenable countable discrete group. How can I show that the group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ has no injective direct summand? 

Let $K=\mathbb{F}_2((t))$ be the field of formal Laurent series over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Now consider $K^3$ as an additive group and its dual group $\hat{K^3}$, which consists of all continuous group homomorphism $\chi$ from $K^3$ into the circle Group $\mathbb{T}$, i.e., $\chi$ is a unitary character of $K^3$. It is well-known that for a fixed unitary character $\chi$ of $K$, distinct from the unit character. The mapping $\Phi: K^3\rightarrow \hat{K^3}$, $y\mapsto \chi_y$ is a topological group isomorphism, where $\chi_y$ is the character of $K^3$ defined by $\chi_y(x)=\chi(\sum_{i=1}^3 x_iy_i)$. Define an action of $SL(2,K)$ on $K^3$ by $g.x=(ax_1+bx_2,cx_1+dx_2,x_3+x_1x_2+(ax_1+bx_2)(cx_1+dx_2))$, where $g=\begin{pmatrix} a&b\\ c&d\\ \end{pmatrix}$$ \in SL(2,K)$ and $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in K^3$. Since characteristic of $K$ is 2, we know that 1=-1. Moreover, $1=det(g)=ad-bc=ad+bc$. It follows that $g.x=(ax_1+bx_2,cx_1+dx_2,x_3+acx_1^2+bdx_2^2)$. Since $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2$ for all $x,y\in K$, it is easy to see this action is well-defined. In some sense, you can regard the semidirect product $K^3\rtimes SL(2,K)$ with this action as the Jacobi group in characteristic 2. Now we consider the dual action $\alpha: SL(2,K)\curvearrowright \hat{K^3}$ by $(g.\chi)(x)=\chi(g^{-1}x)$. My question is that what is the corresponding action of $SL(2,K)$ on $K^3$ via the isomorphism $\Phi$? More precisely, find the unique element $y'$ (depending on $g$ and $y$) in $K^3$ such that $\chi_{y'}=\alpha(g)\chi_y$. The isomorphism $\Phi:K^3\rightarrow \hat{K^3}$ is not canonical and we have to fix $\chi$. My favorite choice is that $\chi:\mathbb{F_2}((t))\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$, $\chi(\sum a_nt^n)=\exp(\frac{2\pi i a_{-1}}{2})$. My motivation is to compute all the orbits of the dual action $\alpha: SL(2,K)\curvearrowright \hat{K^3}$. 

Suppose we are given a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ with an action of a finite group $G$. Suppose $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ is finite. What is the relation between $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ and $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ ? Is $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ finite too ? Such algebras occur for example when on considers a smooth projective variety over $k$ with an action of a finite group $G$. If $X$ has a $G$-equivariant tilting bundle $\mathcal{T}$ then $\mathrm{End}_G(\mathcal{T})=\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{T})^G$ would be such an $k$-algebra as above... 

For a linearly reductive Group $G$ over a field $k$ one has that the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$ is semisimple. What can one say about the number of simple representations? For what kind of groups the number is finite? 

No. Let $G$ be a locally compact group acting on a compact Hausdorff topological space $X$. Then the canonical $*$-homomorphism $C^*(G)\rightarrow C(X)\rtimes G$ is injective iff there is an invariant measure on $X$. The later can be equivalent to amenability of $G$ for some $X=\beta^{lu}(G)$. When $G$ is discrete, then $\beta^{lu}(G)$ is the Stone-Cech compactification of $G$. 

I have a few questions about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable, Hausdorff topological groups. Recall that a locally compact group $G$ is said to be amenable at infinity if there exists a topologically amenable action (in the sense of $URL$ of $G$ on some compact Hausdorff space $X$. Permanence property: Q 1. What kinds of permanence properties do we know about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable non-discrete groups? e.g. If $\Gamma$ is a Lattice in $G$, which is amenable at infinity, does it imply that $G$ itself is amenable at infinity? Examples: Q 2. Which locally compact non-discrete groups are known to be amenable at infinity? e.g. Are Haagerup groups amenable at infinity? Q 3. Let $G$ be a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff topological group, which acts amenably on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Does the transformation groupoid $X\rtimes G$ admit a continuous proper negative type function $\psi$? negative type means 1) $\psi(x,e)=0$ for all $x\in X$; 2) $\psi(x,g)=\psi(g^{-1}x,g^{-1})$ for all $(x,g)\in X\times G$; 3) $\sum_{i,j=1}^nt_it_j \psi(g_i^{-1}x,g_i^{-1}g_j)\leq 0$ for all $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^n t_i=0$, $g_i\in G$ and $x\in X$. 

In the article "Categorical resolution of irrational singularities" of Kuzentsov and Lunts is described how one can glue DG-categories. For this let $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ be two small DG-categories. Now consider a bimodule $\phi\in(\mathcal{D}^{op}_2\otimes \mathcal{D}_1)-dgm$. Then the gluing of these two categories along $\phi$ is denoted by $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}_1\times_{\phi}\mathcal{D}_2$ is defined as follows: Objects are triples $M=(M_1,M_2,\mu)$ with $M_i\in\mathcal{D}_i$ and $\mu\in\phi(M_2,M_1)$. Morphism complex is defined via: $\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}}(M,N)=\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}_1}(M_1,N_1)\oplus\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}_2}(M_2,N_2)\oplus \phi^{k-1}(N_2,M_1)$. Now suppose we consider $\phi^{op}\in(\mathcal{D}^{op}_2\otimes\mathcal{D}_1)^{op}-dgm=(\mathcal{D}^{op}_1\otimes\mathcal{D}_2)-dgm$. Now gluing $\mathcal{D}'=\mathcal{D}_2\times_{\phi^{op}}\mathcal{D}_1$. My question is now: Is it possible to get a DG-functor $F:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}'$ in the following way: send $M=(M_1,M_2,\mu)$ to $M'=(M_2,M_1,\mu^{op})$ and anagously for the Morphism complex??? The second question is: If we have a DG-functor $F:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}'$ this clearly induces a functor between the homotopy-category $F':H^0(\mathcal{D})\rightarrow H^0(\mathcal{D}')$. Does $\mathrm{Hom}_{H^0}(M,N)=0$ imply $\mathrm{Hom}(F'(M),F'(N))=0$? 

Hi, I am looking for a software package that will allow me to experiment with the irreducible representations of lie groups (for example, $SL(2,p)$) over the complex field and over finite fields. That is, I would like to get the corresponding matrices for group elements. Thanks, Shachar 

Background: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $X \subset \mathbb{F}^n$ be an affine variety. Let $\pi(X)$ be the projection of $X$ to the first $m < n$ coordinates, $$ \pi(X) = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_m): x \in X\}, $$ and for a point $a \in \mathbb{F}^m$ let $\phi(a,X)$ be the fiber of $X$ over $a$, $$ \phi(a,X) = \{x \in X: x_1=a_1,\ldots,x_m=a_m\}. $$ It is known that $\dim(\pi(X)) + \dim(\phi(a,X)) \ge \dim(X)$ for all points $a$, and that equality holds for all $a \in U$ where $U \subset \mathbb{F}^m$ is a Zariski open set (so, dimension equality holds for "typical" fibers). Question: Are "a-typical" fibers, where the dimension equality doesn't hold, have lower degree than $X$? That is, for all fibers we have that $\deg(\phi(a,X)) \le \deg(X)$ since they are the intersection of $X$ with the degree $1$ variety given by $x_1=a_1,\ldots,x_m=a_m$. Can it be that when $\dim(\pi(X))+\dim(\phi(a,X))>\dim(X)$ it implies that $\deg(\phi(a,X))<\deg(X)$? Example: Let $X$ be defined by $x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_4=0$. Then $\dim(X)=3,\deg(X)=2$. The projection of $X$ to the first $2$ coordinates $x_1,x_2$ has dimension $2$. Fibers over $(a_1,a_2)$ if $(a_1,a_2) \ne (0,0)$ have as expected dimension $3-2=1$. However, the fiber over $(0,0)$ has dimension $2$ (which is $>1$) but degree $1$ (which is $<2$). 

Is there a comlete discription of algebraic groups having only finitely many irreducible representations? ( giving some references would be very kind ) 

Conjecturally, for a complete intersection $X$ the group $K_0(X)$ is finitely generated iff $H^{p,q}(X)=0$ for $p≠q$. This holds if and only if $X$ is a quadric, a cubic surface, or an even-dimensional intersection of 2 quadrics (see M. Rapoport, Complément à l'article de P. Deligne "La conjecture de Weil pour les surfaces K3", Inv. math. 15 (1972), 227-236). But Orlov proved that a intersection of two even-dimensional quadrics admits a semiorthogonal decomposition $D^b(X)=\langle \mathcal{O}_X(-d+3),...,\mathcal{O}_X,D^b(C)\rangle$, where $d$ is the dimension of $X$ and $C$ is a hyperelliptic curve. Since $K_0(C)$ is a direct summand of $K_0(X)$ this is not finitely generated in general. Furthermore $D^b(X)$ does not admit a tilting bundle... 

Let $K$ be a local field of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is a prime number greater than 2. In particular, $(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p$ for $x,y\in K$. The fake Heisenberg group is defined to be $$ G=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1&a&b\\ 0&1&a^p\\ 0&0&1\\ \end{pmatrix}: a,b\in K\}$$ It is a non-abelian, $K$-split connected algebraic group, which is also unipotent with nilpotent length two. Consider its Lie ring $$ \mathfrak{g}=\text{Log}(G)=\{\begin{pmatrix} 0&x&y\\ 0&0&x^p\\ 0&0&0\\ \end{pmatrix}: x,y\in K\}$$ Since $K$ is not perfect, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not stable under scalar multiplication. In particular, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not a vector Space and is different from Lie(G), the Lie algebra associated to G. Q.1: Do we know the unitary dual $\hat{G}$ of $G$? Notice that $G$ is a central non-split extension of the additive group $K$: $$0\rightarrow K\rightarrow G \rightarrow K \rightarrow 0.$$ I can image to apply the Machey Machine to this group extension similar to the real Heisenberg groups. Q.2: Is $G$ CCR? or type I? Q.3: Let $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ be the Pontrjagin dual of the additive group $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $G$ act on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ by the coadjoint action. Are all orbits closed or locally closed in $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$? Recall that the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by $Ad(g)(X)=gXg^{-1}$ for $g\in G$ and $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ and the coadjoint action of $G$ on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ is defined by $Ad^*(g)(f)=f\circ Ad(g^{-1})$ for $f\in \hat{\mathfrak{g}}$. Dear all, my motivation is about the Kirillov orbit method for unipotent Groups over a local field of positive characteristic (see Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in A general Kirillov Theory for locally compact nilpotent groups). It describes the unitary dual of $G$ by its coadjoint orbits. In order to do this, we need to know Q.3 has an affirmative answer according to Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in op. cit. So if the associated Lie ring $\mathfrak{g}$ is a vector space (this is always the case if char(K)=0), then we can identify its Pontrygagin dual with its linear dual, on which the unipotent group $G$ acts algebraiclly by the coadjoint action. Since unipotent Groups act algebraiclly on an affine variety, all its orbits are closed. Then the orbit method (Corollary 7.3 in op. cit.) implies that the group $G$ is CCR and the Kirillov-orbit map is a homeomorphism. Hence, we have affirmative answers for all my questions. For unipotent Groups over a local field $K$ with char(K)=p. I find the above obstruction. However, if we start with a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ (in particular, a vector space) with nilpotent length less that $p$ and consider the group $G=\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ obtained by exponentiating it, then we have affirmative answers for all my questions by exactly same argyments. Remark that $\exp: \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow G, \exp(X)=\sum_{l=0}^{3}\frac{X^l}{l!}$ with the inverse $\text{Log}: G\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}: \text{Log}(g)=\sum_{l=1}^{3} \frac{(-1)^l}{l+1}(1-g)^l$. 

I am searching for a reference for the generalized Bloch conjecture for surfaces. I know that it states that $CH(S)$ is finitely generated if and only if $H^q(S,\Omega^p)=0$, for $q\neq p$, but where I can find it? 

For a linearly reductive group $G$ over $k$ we consider the bounded derived category of finite dimensional representations $D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$. Is the Grothendick group $K_0(D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$ finitely generated? 

The Grothendick group of a smooth curve over $k=\bar{k}$ is $K_0(C)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathrm{Pic}(C)$ and is finitely generated only for $\mathbb{P}^1$. When is $K_0(C)$ finitely generated when $k\neq\bar{k}$? 

Kapranov showed that for a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ there is a tilting bundle. For example if we consider a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=4$ and $\mathbb{P}(V)$ then the tilting bundle is $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{O}\oplus \mathcal{O}(-1)\oplus \sum_{+}(-2)\oplus\sum_{-}(-2)$. Now $\omega^{\vee}_Q=\mathcal{O}(2)$ so what is $\mathrm{Ext}^k(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T}\otimes \mathcal{O}(2))$? This should be zero for $k>0$... 

We can reformulate the problem as follows: given vectors $u_1,\ldots,u_n,v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$, find $\max | \langle u_i,v_j \rangle |$ over all $i,j \in [n]$. Now, if an approximate answer is good enough, I think that for small $m$ an approximate answer with multiplicative error of $1+\epsilon$ can be found in time $\approx n m + (1/\epsilon)^m$. Take an $\epsilon$-net of the $m$-dimensional sphere (that is, a set of points on the sphere such that each other point on the sphere is $\epsilon$-close to one of them). Such a net has size $ (1/\epsilon)^{O(m)}$. Now, hash the vectors $u_1,\ldots,u_n$ to the sphere. Let $u'_i=u_i / \|u_i\|$ be the image of $u_i$. Find the point on the net closest to $u'_i$ (trivially this can be done in time linear in the size of the net, but probably there are some geometric algorithms to do this is constant or near constant time). For each point in the net store the vector close to it with maximal norm. Do the same for $v_1,\ldots,v_n$. To finish, go over all pairs of points in the net and compute the inner products of their associated vectors. 

Suppose we are given two smooth projective varieties $X$ and $Y$ over $k$. Let $D^b(X)$ and $D^b(Y)$ denote the derived category of coherent sheaves. Furthermore let $k\subset L$ be a finite Galois extension of $k$. Suppose there is an equivalence $F:D^b(X\otimes_k L)\rightarrow D^b(Y\otimes_k L)$. If one has an object $\mathcal{T}$ in $D^b(X\otimes_k L)$ that descents i.e. there is an object $\mathcal{K}$ in $D^b(X)$ such that $\pi^*\mathcal{K}\simeq \mathcal{T}$, where $\pi:X\otimes_k L\rightarrow X$ is the projection, does the object $F(\mathcal{T})$ also descent? Maybe this depends on the functor $F$ ? 

Consider the blowup $X$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a single point $p$. Then, Orlov showed that there is a semiorthogonal decomposition $D^b(X)=\langle e,O_X,O_X(1),O_X(2)\rangle$, where $O_X(i)$ is the pullback of $O_{\mathbb{P}^2}(i)$, and $e$ can be taken to be $i_*O_E(-1)$, where $i:E\rightarrow X$ is the inclusion of the exceptional divisor. The objects $e,O_X(i)$ are in fact all exceptional, so their direct sum should be a tilting object for $D^b(X)$. But I dont see why for example $Ext^k(e,\mathcal{O}_X(i))=0$, for $k>0$ ?
