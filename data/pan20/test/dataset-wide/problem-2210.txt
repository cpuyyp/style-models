For the track events, you've nailed it: the 200m standard indoor track means races of the same distance (e.g. 800m) can be notably different from races on a standard 400m outdoor track. In the sprints, the tight banked turns can significantly change the athlete's approach to the race, and some events (e.g. 60m) are only held indoors. For the field events, the reasoning for different records is more tricky. In the throws, e.g. shot put, the implements are different (size and weight). For the jumps, though, the differences are entirely environmental: lack of wind (either supporting or impeding) and different runway surfaces, mostly. In these events, competing indoors can actually be easier (although long jump and triple jump may be limited in the length of their run-up - I'm not sure if that would help or hurt an athlete). 

To add to Ale's thorough answer: in the case of any disqualification in a major athletics event, the official results will usually cite a specific rule in the IAAF competition rules (which Ale linked). If you look up that rule you see what violation they're being disqualified for. In this case it wasn't immediately obvious which exchange was the problem from the results, but often the rule cited in the results gives you the clue you need to explain the disqualification. 

Your question, I think, proposes changing this rule, and you're looking for arguments against. The IAAF rules don't offer justifications, so it's difficult to argue from grounds more specific than "but that's the rules", but here are two reasons a mechanical system would not work: 

A lot of what you're seeing in the news these days is driven by two problems which aren't solved by comprehensive in-competition testing. One is accessibility of athletes for out-of-competition testing, which is an issue in e.g. East Africa, where many elite distance runners train. Maintaining the infrastructure needed to get samples and test them in an unpredictable way is expensive, and despite some significant investment (e.g. by the World Marathon Majors) there still needs to be more funding to do this properly. Much of the negative news about Kenya from WADA has to do with the lack of testing infrastructure. The other problem - and this is what we're seeing from Russia - is the presence (or rumored presence) of state-sponsored structures which facilitate doping on a national level. If anti-doping "agents" (for lack of a better word) are simply testing individual athletes, that's one thing; if they're contending with an entire system which is coordinating evasion of out-of-competition testing, that's entirely another. And the stories coming out of Russia about evasion of testing are real James Bond stuff: local police detaining testers in order to give athletes time to get away, or to invalidate the samples either environmentally (keeping them from being refrigerated) or by breaking the chain of custody, athletes giving their whereabouts as in closed "military cities" to prevent surprise visits from testers, etc. When the full apparatus of the state is employed in protecting dopers, the "arms race" between cheaters and anti-doping officials becomes very expensive, underlining Canadian Coders' point about finances. So, the short answer to your question: in-competition testing happens and is pretty comprehensive, but it's not enough and the implications of closing the gaps are all expensive. 

They are performance trackers. They track a player's vital statistics (heart rate, etc) as well as their movement. Their average speed, their distance covered, etc. As for the "bra-like" design, it would appear to just be the result of needing a small and unencumbered design that allows for minimal interruption, maximum body contact, and full range of motion.

This would be considered dead ball contact and would result in a technical foul( or a flagrant foul if it was violent contact). Player A would get 2 free throws (1 if he made the layup) and then another 2 free throws for the dead ball foul. NBA Video Rulebook on dead ball contact. 

The pitching change officially occurs when the new pitcher takes the mound. For example, let's say Pitcher A finishes a half inning with his team losing. During the next half inning, his team takes the lead and the manager either pinch-hits for Pitcher A or decides to put in Pitcher B to pitch next, Pitcher A would still get a Win assuming his team maintains the lead they got. 

They're called stabilizers and, among other things, they help improve the accuracy and balance of the bow. 

There has been analysis done to look at the correlation between individual WAR and the record of teams. Most entities that calculate WAR make the same assumption that a team full of replacement level players would win about 52 games in a season (.320 Win %). Below are 2 links that show high correlation when studying the relationship between WAR and team records. Hardball is more in depth and (mostly) impartial. FanGraphs is more of a summary and could be less impartial. Hardball Times WAR Study FanGraphs WAR Study 

It looks like the game against Chaminade is exempt from the 31 game maximum due to an NCAA rule about playing games in Hawaii. Here is a link giving information about that. 

As you can imagine, scheduling an MLB season is not the easiest task to accomplish. Especially with all the different specifications enacted by the league and the player's union. More or less, there have to be 2,430 games scheduled in a time frame between 178 to 183 days that minimizes travel distance and consecutive playing days (no more than 20 days in a row). The MLB (and their scheduling contractor) receive a list of requests from teams for all the things they would like for the season. The MLB tries to fit all these in, but again, the schedule isn't the most flexible thing. With that being said, there isn't any known reasoning behind what requests get granted and which ones do not (outside of the Cincinnati Reds always starting the season at home due to the club being the oldest in the league). I would imagine that Orioles just have Opening Day at home at the top of their list, as opposed to other teams that might have other requests they feel are more important.

“Hitting the wall”, or "pinging" is colloquial for having your heart rate bouncing off your Max Heart Rate (MHR). Being overly out of breath and head-dizzy are symptoms. “Bonking” is colloquial for when your muscles run out of glucose-etc. Your entire body aching – especially your shoulders – is a symptom. These are two very distinct feelings; but are somewhat interrelated. Sounds like you're suffering from the first. In my experience the first can start to happen more dramatically (noticeably) as you get older – “older” as in 36yo mind you : / I had the first example above happen so bad one time in Santa Cruz that I had to get off my bike and walk. I had had plenty of food, and absolutely knew myself – I knew I wasn't bonking and couldn't understand what was happening to me – but I pushed too hard for too long to try and keep up with an amazing athlete on a hill climb. This is colloquially called “exploding”. You see it all the time in professional bike races during hard climbing events. Once you “explode” you can't recover while still providing output to the bike. This happens easier as you get older – even though you think you are at exactly the same (or better) physical condition. A third thing is ”heat exhaustion”. This is a whole 'nother animal, and the most dangerous of the lot. I've explored the depths of these three failure points quite a few times. It's good to know where they are, but to be sure, one day you may “take it to the next level” and be completely shocked by what your body is doing,even though you think you understand what these things are... You need a heart rate monitor, and to review the breadcrumb heart rate data for a race on your computer and see exactly what your heat is doing when you feel that way. The numbers will be clear as day. Or you can just look at your wrist/stem when riding and SEE you're “pinging” off your MHR – and if you stay there for long, you'll feel that “explosion” coming - irretrievably out of breath and often dizziness. “That's rodeo” as far as bicycle racing (sans downhill, in most cases) – scrunching up against a predetermined heart/work rate and staying there. The way this feels, as far as work output, can vary widely – hugely in fact – depending on altitude, food, sickness and countless other things – and especially nerves – but the numbers don't lie as far as optimizing your output. Hope that helps. Be careful. Genetic predisposition for heart problems may onset. A full checkup may be required – even if you're only 40-some years old. People die from heat attacks in their 40s – even athletes. EDIT: One final thought – as a runner you probably understand clearly the notion of stride length. How extending your stride just slightly can drastically increase your speed for basically the same amount of work. And like rowing, or swimming, where getting that extra “reach” - even an inch – can really make all the difference in the world for max top-speed. I see breathing as exactly the same – especially road racing. Take a big breath right now. Then take another breath and exaggerate the total input – EXPAND the lungs. THAT right there – training yourself to do that all the time when riding at your predetermined heart rate, will effectively be like having the extra few inches of “reach”. If you ride hard enough long enough – training – you just naturally acquire it. But understanding what the desired end-state condition “looks like”, can really help you get there ..faster. When you “explode”, as I've call it, that whole process of breathing is out of sync with your body. To try best to work through an explosion in a race is exactly – precisely – directly – the art of breathing big and consistent, even though your body is saying you really don't need to – because it's overloaded and wants to make you slow the F' down.... it's making you hyperventilate with shorter 25% quick breaths.
