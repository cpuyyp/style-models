As the title says... What would be the effect to earth or an oceanic planet if it lacks the presence of Radioactive Elements in its crust and mantle. Also can you explain what would happen if we don't have Radioactive Elements in core?

Stop the current crusade/jihad from advancing further Cull extremists from both sides Establish yourself as a prophet of a 'God of light' and establish a religion Destroy the validity of both Christian-esque and Islam-esque religions not with overwhelming military/fire power but influence and if possible economics Establish a pantheon of false(nonexistent) gods to denounce Christian-esque and Islam-esque further. Destroy all scriptures of the 2 religions Convert most(60%) of the population to your church, and you shall name it 

My answer for this question is to use magic... specifically time magic This creature can be starve with right application of time magic. I doubt it would survive in a time capsule that has its time bubble accelerated to million years per second... It is a living creature thus it needs sustenance... the passage of time is your friend in this case 

To begin with the gods of both Islam-esque and Christianity-esque in my story are just super humanoid beings with semi-immortality(They won't die but can be killed) but they already died including all their offsprings that would have taken their place. All thats left are their super advance technologies(The 'gods' were in fact the last 2 of their super advanced civilization). Come 500 years after they died the religion that they established is still going strong with Crusades and Jihads dividing the world in half. The world has magic(a mutation from the god like humanoid beings) The good thing about the crusades and jihad is that because the whole world is split in two and its might makes right rule in most areas, the roads are fully developed, there are industries capable of of supporting the armies of both sides on a massive scale. But also the population is always culled due to the crusades and jihad so suffering and poverty in most war torn places runs rampant but the inner territories of both sides flourishes due to its distance from war zone. The difference between the rich and poor is so large that the fear of rebellion can be realize once the crusades and jihad ends Now you come to the story as someone from modern day earth and see the world divided in to two, just that this world is ripe of strife and suffering. Being the good person you are, you want to put a stop to it. The only probable way to do it is to create a religion to false gods. Upon stumbling on their hidden cache of technologies you are only able to use 3 things atm. 

The "Anti-Utopia" Proof I will tell you one thing that I do know though: if a utopia is perfection, all it takes is one person who believes that they are worse off to, by definition, make a situation non-utopian; so if you applied StackExchange's principles to my country's governing structure, I can tell you right now that there is near-zero possibility that any utopia could result since I would be miserable every time some group of 5 (or make it 500) "trusted" individuals voted to suppress what I was doing that day. You are going to get a lot of super-pissed-off people. Right now I live in a constitutional-republic with a semi-democratic election process (the U.S.), and it is already bad enough that my neighbors have so much control over my life - I would not want to give them even more control. 

A lot of answers here seem to be answering the related but un-asked question of "How does the lucky person get away with it or maximize winnings?" The answer to the actual question is rather simple and short... How can the casino prove I'm cheating? If you are not cheating, they cannot prove that you are. How would they? The casino cannot prove something when there is no proof. The casino could try to plant fake evidence. This is unlikely to happen unless you are breaking the bank for any given, specific casino. Some people do walk away with millions, and the casinos don't plant evidence against them all, so why would you be different? If you are raking in Billions from 1 single casino, then maybe they would try something. At that point, though, what they are doing is illegal, so just use your imagination. Maybe they rig their own roulette game in a fashion that you could for cheating and they say you did it, maybe get false witnesses. There are 1000 things they could do here. Speaking of illegal activity, casinos are highly regulated in a lot of ways. It is illegal even for the casino to tamper with their own devices to cheat in the casino's favor, just like it is illegal for you to tamper with them to cheat. That said, they will definitely suspect you of cheating. There have been times when people have cheated, the casinos have looked into them and proven they did cheat, and those people have gone to jail. What Can (or Will) the Casino do? Even though the casino cannot prove you are cheating, that doesn't matter. They don't need to prove it. They can and will simply kick you out. It is that simple. If you keep winning too much money in a way that does no good for the casino (provides no positive publicity for casino, causes nobody around you to bet more, etc.), eventually someone will come over and just force you to leave. What Else is the Casino Likely to do? Planting evidence is unlikely, as mentioned above, since that could get the casino in big trouble. However, that does not mean the casino will just roll over. I will also go into the situation where you try to get one last big win so the casino has little time to react, but I will cover it from the casino's point of view, per your question. I have heard of people being denied their winnings before. Even if this is illegal (some have suggested it is, and I would agree), that does not bother the casino if they do not lose out. This, then, becomes just another bet, another game of chances. Odds are that people who are not given all the chips they deserve are not going to take legal action against the casino, and even if some do then the casino just pays you what you were owed in the first place. That is: there is no negative for the casino since they lose (approximately) the same amount whether they pay you now or pay you when your lawyers threaten them and so there is little incentive to bully you into leaving without all earnings, but there is much positive for the casino if you don't send lawyers. So it's a "win/not-lose" situation for the casino to bully you into not taking that last big winning when they are kicking you out. Further, if you have no witnesses or evidence, it may be hard to prove that you were denied what was rightfully yours. If you leave without all your winnings when the casino bullies you, what proof do you have that you actually were denied what was yours? If you were keeping a low profile, you likely left few or no witnesses. This makes it even easier for the casino to withhold what is yours. Summary The casino can't prove anything but doesn't need to. The casino can and will kick you out. It is possible they might try to bully you into leaving without all your money. 

My answer would be Massively scaled stellar mining rig/barge/station (Mining star matter) so fast that leave it for a day or two you'll notice changes happening in the star... But we can go better... You have warp technology right so why not warp stellar matter using hawking radiation(black hole) to another enemy of yours? suck the star of its matter and throw that matter to your enemy! Not only it could collapse a star since it will be missing alot of its mass since you are warping it away but hit another enemy as well with it! Imagine a star being pulled apart and its mass being sent to your enemies! It will not go supernova(as far as i know) but you can be sure that they got nothing on your stellar sized plasma flame thrower... Since this is a galactic strategic weapon price shouldn't be an issue constructing a warp ring enough to engulf atleast 10% of the star or 1% for that matter depending on how fast you want the star gone or your enemy gone... take your pick! 

So a man who was about to die was given a chance to evade death under the circumstances that he must travel to parallel world earth where magic exists and has only medieval level technology. He has 3 years to prepare before his departure, the date of his death. One of his preparations is about a powered assault armor. With near future technology and virtually unlimited funds. He must achieve the following for the powered assault armor. 

There are 2 series(Records of a fallen vampire, Muv-Luv unlimited) that i read a while ago about this topic, it doesn't only stop rockets from flying(This also included SLBMs launched from Atlantic, target was an island in japan), anything generally larger than 10 meters is shot down mid air with the use of LASERs The lasers were used by aliens in those 2 series. Aliens from RoaFV used meteors to strategically place their laser turrets all around the world(They camouflaged it). The gov't didn't know it was laser turrets. And when they knew, they cant even destroy it due to its molecular armor BETA(Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race) has laser class that has pin point accuracy that the moment you surpassed 100m off the ground you have 5 seconds to go below it to evade a laser salvo from this little aliens they also have extra ordinary range too and virtually can target anything they see. Taking an idea from this scenario. An efficient but very effective laser can be used in near future with the current fad of bleeding edge technology that R&Ds are fond of releasing these days. Then again why lasers. Because you only need to point it in a right direction, and boom, the problem is solved. 

The smallest geological change necessary to ensure that insufficient fossils exist to create the evolutionary ideas as you requested is: No change at all. Fossils did not provide the "origin of humanity" idea in the first place As has already been pointed out, the idea that creatures evolved from common ancestors did not originate with analysis of fossils. Fossils may already be insufficient to trace the link you speak of Further, even when fossils came into the equation, they did just as much, if not more, to dismiss modern evolutionary theories as they did to support it. For a long time there was a controversy called "The Missing Link." The argument went something like this (simplified for this answer): You have found fossils of humans, fossils of apes, and fossils of an extinct semi-apelike creature that is our common ancestor, but you have found no fossils that suggest the extinct creature ever evolved into humans. Indeed, some prominent evolutionists were concerned about this and looked hard for evidence to connect the proposed common ancestors to their modern day descendants. It was even suggested by some of them that, if they fail to find some of the evidences their model suggested should exist, then the modern evolutionary model should be abandoned. We do have more evidence now. However, the evidence is still not conclusive enough for all scientists to agree. In fact, there is a minority group (but still quite large) of scientists who do not believe that humans and apes have a common animal ancestor from which they both descended. In science, even among people with the same (or similar) beliefs, there is a lot of argument; scientists do not all hold strong to one unified belief where they are all in concert. Even many of the supporters of the current evolutionary model will suggest that the fossil record as dug up so far is not yet sufficient to trace human origin. Summary The fossil record we have is enough for the majority of scientists in that field to support the modern evolutionary model, but it is still sufficiently lacking such that a reasonably large portion of reasonable scientists do not support it. If there are smart, well educated professors and scientists who do not believe that even our current fossil record that we do have in reality is sufficient to make human evolution traceable, to the point where they don't even believe there is a link to be traced, then surely the amount of geological change necessary to suggest such a link is untraceable is zero change. In fact, I speculate that the modern evolutionary model would still exist today, mostly intact, even if we had no fossils more than a few generations old for study. 

Thanks to discussion with @aslum for teasing out the following paragraph... The problem here is with defining a utopia by terms of perfection. If we instead defined a utopia as just "a really good state where the average happiness per person is maximized," then things would be different and you might be able to accuse me of a "No true Scotsman" fallacy. As it stands, asserting "Everything is perfect" is easily disproven every time anyone complains (reasonably) about anything. For this reason, it might well be literally impossible to have a complete and true utopia as long as it is defined as such, since all it takes is two people with mutually-exclusive desires to make the utopia impossible. For example, I roll my eyes at "anti-gun" people, I believe that being allowed to open-carry firearms is necessary to a safe society, and I absolutely hate it that my state cracks down on firearms - I really don't care what anti-gun people think. For me, a utopia simply cannot ban open-carry of firearms. But I know that someone else might freak out every time they see me with a firearm, and they might (irrationally, in my opinion, but my opinion is irrelevant to this person) think I'm going to rob them; for this person, a utopia simply cannot include people open-carrying firearms. Our utopias are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if we use a definition wherein the neighborhood is perfect for both of us, our neighborhood utopia is not possible.
