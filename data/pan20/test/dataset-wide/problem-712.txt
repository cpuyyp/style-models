This is a debate that gets picked up on every bicycle forum known to man (okay, that might have been exaggerating a bit). Typically you start to ask the question when you notice that the morning after you have used your CO2 cartridge, your tyre is ridiculously low. By no means am I a chemist but, as it has been explained to me, CO2 and butyl are more soluble than N2/O2 and butyl. Most tubes are constructed from butyl (fancy pants cyclists will sometimes use Latex tubes, haha). Due to the increased solubility you can expect that a CO2 inflated tyre will need re-inflating sooner than one you pump up by hand. $URL$ While the explanation above is dealing w/ escape from balloons I am going to assume that we can take that information and apply it to our discussion. Now, if i am incorrect (which I often am) please let me know! I just noticed I didn't tackle the temperature issue. I do know that temperatures exceeding 50 degrees celcius (above 125 farenheit) can result in the potential for ... explosive fun, in regards to CO2 canisters. $URL$ This company has a proprietary gas blend that won't leak from your tubes apparently ... ... ... 

There are a few things that could help the shimmy, but there is no real silver bullet. Typically the shimmy is a function of head tube angle, top tube length and frame (specifically top and down tube) elasticity. Jobst Brandt describes it best in this article so I won't get into too much detail on the whys. There are a few things that reduce or negate the shimmy that have worked to varying degrees for myself. 1) Knees against the top tube. Squeeze the top tube with your knees. 2) Stem length. Sometimes a longer stem might help out. Very frame dependent and you would not want to change your fit imo. 3) Handlebar bag. Distribute some weight to the front and see if a handlebar bag can help overcome the gyroscopic forces created by the wheel. 4) Switching to a set of tyres w/ more 'tread' (ie. knobbies). I haven't tried this but the jobst brandt article indicates this could work. The Kaitai is pretty unique in its long top tube, exceedingly short head tube and relatively steep head angle. This also makes the bike a 'tough fit' for the majority of people. 

To deal with the question posed below I thought I would add on. I ran out of space in the comments section. I think it is because most of us are everyday working joes. Sure we ride way too much and some of us compete. But typically we have to either be on our feet or sitting at the desk, day in day out. Cycling is incredibly repetitive and puts you in a position much different than that of your everyday 'healthy' posture. It creates muscular imbalances that can affect your pelvic tilt, your mid back, your neck and more. This can affect how you stand, how you sit and how you feel day to day. So for myself, I stretch so that I can feel better walking around, so that I can feel more like a functional human being. I stretch (and more accurately engage in pilates and yoga) as a form of 'cycling rehab' to try and correct those imbalances. As well that is why I cross train much of the year. From all of that I take it to, the better I feel day to day, the better I perform. And in my experience it has paid off in spades. That said, if your spend 6-8 hours a day on the bike and the rest of the day off of your feet resting, perhaps you would prefer your body to become more oriented towards the position you take on the bike. But for the rest of us ... 

I don't use them is if someone is into racing and we are looking at changing a flat being important down to the second. In that case it is just another impediment to speed. Otherwise it keeps the system (whether presta, schrader or dunlop) clean and easy. 

Pam cooking spray. Spray the frame and the mud falls away. I'm sure the same can be said of waxes etc... anything that gives your bike a nice shiny coating. Anyways, people have been using Pam for years. 

Carbon compound can definitely help. As the following link points out, it helps you avoid 'over torquing' to ensure that the component doesn't slip. $URL$ In my personal domain, if there is carbon and carbon, or carbon and some other material, thou must use fiber grip. And a torque wrench. No questions. 

Personally, no, I have not had any problems w/ carbon fibre mountain bikes. I am currently on my 5th such steed (Trek Fuel EX 9.8) and it is going quite well. My thumb ... not so well. But, that's besides the point. Of note ... I weigh 145 lbs and ride the bike for what it is meant. I have seen many broken carbon frames. Like wise I have seen many broken aluminium frames as well. Typically when I see a broken frame it is caused by many of the same things. a)Riding a bike outside of its comfort range. If you have a 26" carbon fibre hardtail, do not think it would work for jumps or all mountain riding. You will break it. Don't take your 4" travel carbon race bike to the downhill course either. Use common sense. b)Maintain your bike. Use a torque wrench and carbon prep. Check linkages. Keep it clean. Those who don't tend to see things (or miss things ...) break with greater frequency. Scratch depth has alot to do with this. A simple scratch ... no, it doesn't render it useless. I have many scratches on many carbon bikes. I have paint chips etc... and they are still a-okay. What I would be aware of is a 'scratch' on the handlebar that could result in stress risers and eventual breakage. Again, this goes back to my points above concerning maintenance. Regular maintenance (of any bike) is key. There are also advances in carbon that companies are indicating have created a much stronger frame. The following are two I am familiar with but I am SURE there are more. $URL$ Cannondale has 'Ballistec Hi-Mod' carbon which I believe is supposed to be similar. OCLV is just another way of 'laying up' carbon. I have had many OCLV bikes and have enjoyed them immensely. I am sure I would have enjoyed a monocoque frame or a mitred frame as well. In my mind it is the companies warranty that matters most. Will they stand behind you if the frame fails from reasonable riding? In my experience, yes, Trek will. But, I'm not here to push Trek. Buying a well known frame, with a strong warranty from a shop you know will go to bat for you is what I would recommend. In regards to carbon lay up, yes, it does matter. The ability to strategically lay the carbon (or in terms of the new BMC Impec weave the carbon) allows engineers to create strength where strength is needed and to remove weight were less material is necessary. It can be likened to the 'butting' of steel, aluminium and titanium frames. Sorry for the Trek angle throughout this but as the question regarded OCLV and I have experience with both, it was inevitable. 

If you are looking at the Biopace/Rotor/O-Symmetric relationship as similar due purely to aesthetics, or their similarity due to their lack of similarity to round chainrings then, yes, they are similar products. But, that said, from the RotoR website "The Q-Rings are elliptical; the Biopace and O.SYMETRIC chainrings are asymmetrical.". And Sheldon Brown points out that Shimano called Biopace "point-symmetric egg curve". Which really only gives them the similarity of being different from the norm which in this case, is a round chainring, but if you go a step further, they are quite different. So, to try and answer the question posed above. 

For your bike I would probably recommend a 'moto style' front fender that uses an expansion fitting in the steerer tube to remain fixed in place. My reason being that it does not look like you have eyelets on that fork for easy full fender installation. $URL$ A seatpost clamp style rear fender is my recommendation. Again, it looks like a full fender set w/ struts would be difficult to mount to your bike (not impossible, just a little finicky) and quite frankly, it would look a wee bit weird to put a full fender on the rear and a moto style on the front. Just sayin'. $URL$ 

You are trading in 'road feel' and perhaps increasing your rolling resistance for durability. For example, a set of Vittoria Open Corsa tyres have 320 tpi (threads per inch) and are quite supple. They will, to some people, give the perception of a smoother ride with less rolling resistance. The same could be said for many of the higher end race tyres. By adding a puncture resistant layer or 'belt' you can reduce the suppleness of the tyre and increase your rolling resistance. $URL$ Typically if you are commuting or just putting in long training miles I would recommend a puncture resistant tyre. If you are racing, TT'ing or participating in an event where you are worried about mere seconds, I would perhaps not use a puncture resistant tyre and choose weight and reduced rolling resistance first and foremost. 

Multi tool w/ a replaceable derailleur hanger as part of it. Or just a universal derailleur hanger. Pretty nice. Mind you, if you are touring you might as well carry your proper hanger as a 'just in case'. Having a phillips head screw driver can save you. I have snapped the head of the front shifter cable mid way through a 160km point to point ride ... I just dialed in the limit screws and blocked the gear in. Same can be done for the rear derailleur to get you home. A quicklink or power link is exceptionally useful to have on a ride. You can fix a broken chain enough to simply get home or if it was just a tweaked link, replace it, and have a fully functioning geared bike to ride home (or continue on your ride). For mountain biking a spoke key can be essential. Break a spoke? Over tension the two opposing spokes to even it out. You can wrap the broken spoke around its nearest or, if you have tape, tape it to the other spoke. A friend has stuffed a tyre full of grass (seriously) enough to ride the trails home. It did ferment a bit inside and was fairly odiferous after but it worked really well.
