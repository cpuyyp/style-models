Go to therapist / doctor. If you don't want - try tests like this one - to identify your problem. Then read/watch/find out how to fix the problem. Usually doctor is much better option - like that two from video. In case of problems I would choose them, instead of trying fix something for myself. 

I would add forearms rolling, since main muscles are there. You can do that everyday, a specially when they are light, and short. I'm doing forearms rolling every 2-3 weeks - with lacrosse ball that is a bit painful. Sometimes that pain is inside the muscles, or just touching skin pains. I perform it to relax forearms and prevent elbows problems - like golfer's elbow, exercising every 2-3 weeks do the job for me. 

To be precise - you want better stamina? I would use powerball, or some other exercises that requires squeezing. Instead of short term - high intensity, use lower intensity, and train longer. Please observe your body, elbows a specially. You can develop golf elbow, and that is quite tricky to get rid of. You need to stop, and rest... and you have exam. EDIT And agree that it can be done anywhere, not only at the gym. For instance you can buy something to squeeze, like de-stress ball, and squeeze it while watching TV... Other from that. Famous violin players ware able to squeeze porcelain cups. So strong their fingers ware. Also talk with guitar players - they have strong fingers too. Problem is that writing requires more precision, and your pain comes from having muscles stretched to control pen. 

Welcome! Start with your body weight exercises. Lady push ups, then normal push ups. Forward/backward lunges, for legs. Keep back straight, do not bend it forward, and do not move front knee off toes. Maybe two small dumbbells in your hands just to have better posture. If that sounds complicated - ask for help - one hour per week with personal trainer can help a lot. Plank is other exercise I would propose. Try to start with something called full body workout. That mean - every time all muscles are trained. Put 'Full body sample workout for girl" into google. For me that was one of the first results. Read, try if it works for you. If not - just ask another question. WE will be more then happy to answer. There are two main points, or tips here. Changing body is long process, it takes months to have results. You are young, so it can faster, but still - all is about small steps. Every week worked counts, and next January, someone else will start. And then you will see how much you have done. Next tip - it is quite easy to get injured. Thats why I'm insisting on small steps. Watch your body, if something is painful - understand why, and what to do with it. Trainer can help, but at the end it is you, and your body, so be sure you understand each other. ;) I assume that your back pain is in the place where bar was... if so then you can roll towel over the bar. There are foams to put on the bar as well. You body was not prepared for that, tissues got squeezed, so there is pain, perhaps bruises as well. With time, it will be better, after 2-3 months you will do it without a problem. Squat is complex exercise, so I would advise to ask trainer, or someone to watch, and tell you if everything is OK. Trainers are there, so you can talk with them. From time to time, they can look and give you a hint. If that is too often, or that person see much work - paid training will be proposed. To select best trainer - talk with some of them, talk with other people at the gym - if you like trainer, and other people says his is known to be good. At least that is not random choice. 

Interesting question. If considered 1 hour training - running can be better. Why? You burn much more calories then in other trainings, so your blood needs to deal with all of that. I mean oxygen, nutrition, and removing wastes. My heart says it works pretty hard, when I run, sometimes trying to escape... For shorter trainings - rowing? or maybe stationary bike with moving arms? That are exercises, which deals with many muscles at once. Amount of energy produced in short period of time can be quite impressive. And that mean some work for blood as well. Strength training, with rest for 2-3 min gives blood bust, but for short term. After some time - say 2-3 years of training that goes down, as your body learns how to deal with pressure. 

At first bench press, incline bench press looks OK. However you need coordination, as @PoloHoleSet mentioned, but also punch is kind of explosive, while bench pressing is rather maximum power exercise. Static vs dynamic. If your gym has landmine attachment put one end of barbell, and throw other end, catch with opposite hand. Like in this film. Be sure to use whole body. Later, you can do some feet movements. Problem with this exercise is that you are moving catching hand back, and then punching. During the fight that is clear signal what is going on. 

Please try to do weight training, and after that indoor bike. Can you do biking for 40 min? Watch your pulse, and keep it around 60%-70% of your max. You can watch something on phone, read a book, listen to music, podcasts. Just move your legs. To be honest 1 hour tree times a week is not much. Looks like bare minimum. If time is your limit. There are different options for training - hiit, tabata - are on one end of scale. Idea is that weight can be lost by tweaking metabolism. In other words you are loosing weight not only when exercising. Walking for long time is on the other end. Some people says that an hour at gym per day, and sitting for rest of day is bad idea. So we should rather move whole day, with some more effort from time to time. That is more natural - from perspective of our evolution. Hint - stretching in front of TV is also an exercise. Switch chair with gym ball. Note that fat makes the process much more difficult. Maybe that is not a big issue in your case, but still. Fat has significant influence on the way our body reacting on insulin. Muscles have their role as well, but they are at other side. From that point it is good to build muscles, normal size muscles... Counting calories is good idea. I can't recall reference, but I have heard that people with that habit has much less chance on yo-yo effect. So good for you. If your diet is not working, or you feel it should go much better - I would advise visiting doctor, and blood tests. If you don't want to do that - think about diabetic diet. My first bet is problem with sugar level. But it can be also lack of D3 vitamin, or something else - say thyroid problems. In general you must loose if not eating enough. On the other hand, we are not taking all from food, if there is no need for that. We have different metabolisms. So there is slight space that makes two people eating same things and behaving differently. In your case, at very first look - your body reacted on initial change, but now it adopted to new reality, or maybe it is lack of sun, so D3 level is low... Just go and do blood test - you will know what is going on. 

You wrote about x-rays, so I assume that you are in contact with doctor. So I'll skip that part. For squats, and deadlifts - general rule is that you need to move shoulders back, with shoulder blades moved down, and pitched together. Reasons for that comes from shoulders, and back. That is good for shoulders, since they are open, and can take wider motion range, without later problems. Stretched back gives more stability, and makes muscles to take weight. My shoulders mobility is/was poor, so I've developed squat with wide grip. Problem is that I can't put the bar lower, on the other hand - I do 3 sets with 4-6 reps with 140kg as a normal training for maintaining squats. Personally, I don't think that squats / deadlifts are causing the issue, it can be with you for long time. That exercises just made it to show up. It could happen if you do that without trainer, then you can bend spine, and that could cause the problem. Note that, you can "develop" that problem with many other exercises - like over head press... People tend to bend spine too much, to support the move. Even pull ups can cause that problem - if done in cross fit / dynamic way without earlier preparation. Kelly Starrett is concentrated on spine, look for criticism about him to have wide view. But the way he describes how we should take care about spine - must know. Order of stretching muscles before exercise, to stabilize spine, properly support it - as wrote - must know. Listen to your body, listen to your doctor, and it will be OK. 10 kg is a pack of water. So if you take two of them from ground it the shop and put it into the cart? We do a lot exercises, gym is to teach us how to do them without problems. That was what your trainer did telling you about shoulders. Fingers crossed. Hope it helps. 

As Mike described - depends. When you walk - typically you start with hill. There are some phases like foot locking. When walking that is effective, as things developed during evolution. When running - there are different forces, and you should land on forefoot, not on hill. That should happen, when the foot is close / under your body. That way you use quads to absorb forces. All that is present on great pictures, from Mike's post. Like bended upper body when running. On the other hand - you need to be aware about that details, and realize they make difference. To the topic. When you run hill-toes - all forces goes though knees, and hips. That is easier, but can harm joints, a specially when your weight is higher, or you are running with backpack. Try to run that way without shoes - no way to do that. Even on treadmill - I've tried... When to switch? Depends on your needs - if you want to burn calories, on treadmill - that is not big deal. Real challenge starts when you want to run fast, be effective. And here Mike's post comes to play. As a side note - some questions, and side comments. How long we are wearing that fancy shoes? How long we are running? Are shoes done to help or to sell better? Manufactures gives more, and more support for hills, since that makes running easier, but not necessarily better. Issue is when you get that knowledge and it is too late. 

I know that with using a lot of chewing gum, you can develop bigger chewing muscles. And actually that is a problem - at least with musculus masseters. They do not get smaller. Bigger muscles influence on your skull, and brings pain. Getting back to the question. They can get bigger, if putted under higher load, but not always bigger is better. Be sure you know what you are doing, sometimes that can be really tricky. 

Well, it can be that you've just grown... for instance half a year ago more parts of your body ware, as your cheeks. If so - keep training, and things will be fine. Even if that is not your case. Teens are growing in different way. For some - whole upper body stays almost as before, but legs are much longer. Or hands... Watch your family old photos. It can be your father, or uncle. Ask that person, or family for more advices. From that perspective it can be other thing then loosing fat. 

I'm using Garmin's Vivosmart HR band. HR monitor is very accurate. Steps are calculated a bit silly, as well as floors. Looks like band is prepared for runners, so if you spend more time at the gym - there are better options. I know, there is new version of this band, with VO2 metering, but that is quite questionable to me. They have all the data somewhere in the cloud, so I can see what they show. I'll look for something with Android, or Tizen - or better to say - system that can be extended. I can do that for my own, but also I can use software provided by others. That way, I can better track different aspects of my training - like breaks between sets. Also I can have that data for my own. 

If weather is worm you can walk for about 15 min after the training. That slow down allows better regeneration. Also rolling legs after training can be beneficial. If you plan to stretch before training - do short, dynamic stretching, which prepares for the exercise. 

As long as you do not pull your head - it does not matter. You can also keep hands side by side, or straight. Try different positions, and choose best for you. From time to time change it - maybe something goes better over time? You can stress muscles isometrically, or move chest and hips closer. That is other topic, but can influence hands position.
