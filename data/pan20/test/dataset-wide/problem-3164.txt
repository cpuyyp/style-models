A good definition of history that historians use is 'History is the study of change over time.' Historical studies, to a large extent, rely on theory and methodology. A series of facts is a narrative, it is not a historical study. Analyzing those facts, placing them into context, understanding the underlying factors that contributed to those facts occurring, all of that and then some is encompassed by the study of 'history.' Furthermore, history is very much interdisciplinary. Various graduate programs in history will encourage students to take classes in other disciplines (anthropology is a perfect example) and incorporate what they learn outside the field into their dissertation, articles, reviews, books, etc. Historians usually have to become immersed in the subjects they study. Thus economic historians have to have a general and at times detailed understanding of economics that's relative to the time period and location they specialize in. The same applies to politics, labor, medicine, technology, philosophy, warfare, etc. I can't comment on what those outside the discipline of history do, but I can say that 'outsiders' who try to write about history usually fail in that they do not understand how to incorporate either theory or methodology. What readers are left with are either popular histories that add nothing new to the canon or failed attempts to discuss historical subjects/ideas. 

First thing you need to look for is the bibliography and endnotes/footnotes. Archival research is a must for professional historians when they are writing their dissertation, which eventually becomes their first manuscript/book. As well, they have to discuss and incorporate theory and methodology. Later in their careers they can, if they so choose, write books mainly based on secondary literature. Such books can do one of two things; they can challenge an accepted narrative/paradigm or simply create a general history for those interested in a specific subject. Most authors who write about history but have not been educated at the graduate level in history will not have a good grasp of theory and methodology and will, unfortunately, add little to nothing to our understanding of specific historical events/ideas/people/etc. that they choose to write about. 

I ask not about lawyers who serve as military lawyers. The movies Path of Glory (1957) and Thin Red Line (1998) contain lawyers who serve as officers suffering front-line action: in the former, Colonel Dax, a criminal lawyer, portrayed by Colonel Dax, who blows the whistle before going over the top to lead an infantry assault against the Germans. in the latter, USMC CPT James Staros (portrayed by Elias Koteas). 

I limit this question to universities in Canada. 1. What rough percentage of universities required Ancient Greek and Latin, for admission? 2. Then what about after admission, during university? 3. If 2 is true, to what difficulty or degree were these mandated courses? 4. For both questions 1 and 2, would you please roughly date your answers (from when to when)? 

At the 31:20 juncture of Episode 20 in total (Episode 10 of Season 2) of the AMC TV show Turn, because the British infantry march slowly in formation (rather than running) to leave the battlefield at the Battle of Monmouth, several soldiers needlessly perish after easily being targeted and shot with muskets of the Continental Army soldiers, but who cease fire after 1 or 2 minutes after the British start leaving. This TV has been adjudged historically inaccurate; so is the above accurate? If so, is not marching under retreat stupid, unreasonable? Did the importance of formation and order outweigh the value of human life?

Interest only: Standard disclaimers: Correlation does not imply causation, YMMV, do not bend staple fold or mutilate, IANAL, DTTAH: But Googles NGram viewer returns the following interesting curve sets. The upper graph pair shows is a case insensitive search for "rum" and for "pirates" in English language documents in general. The lower graph pair shows the same search in "English fiction". Both graphs have the same frequency of occurrence in their body of literature per minor axis division but te upper graph is slightly more compressed physically. ie comparisons may be made in terms of eg vertical divisions rather than linear dimensions. The real world results show a marked correspondence between occurrences of rum and of pirates with a few periods of substantial variation. The fiction results suggest that rum gets increasing mention relative to pirates with time but that relative mention of both is higher than in the general literature. The NGRam viewing system allows of access to the source documents so it would be possible to investigate the reasons for the patterns seen above. But, that may well spoil the fun.
