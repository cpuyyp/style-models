Having learnt a bit about weightlifting programs using barbells and other stuff, now I wonder how male gymnasts train in order to become muscular and strong. Do they use weights in the same way as bodybuilders and power lifters do? I know those guys train from their very early childhood, but surely the principles can be adapted and they could be useful to some extent for people in other life circumstances. 

Running on the sand of the beach is supposed to be harder for your leg muscles and perhaps less stressful on your joints. What kind of shoes are best for that? Normal jogging shoes? 

It is running (and NOT squatting) what puts stress on my knees (Kate was right, I now know). In fact I often have to insert some extra non-running day in my schedule until small pain signals that arise after a running session completely disappear. Strictly correct squats (I mean slow bodyweight squats) seem to be harmless to my knees, and I do them regularly. BUT: The tiniest deviation from perfect form causes a lot of damage, specially near the bottom squat position. Until I learnt to squat properly I was really scared and had to stop all leg activity and wait a couple of days very often. 

When playing chess against the computer I have a trick to quickly decide if I am going to be white or black. If the date is odd (eg. July 21) I play black. If it is even (eg. July 22) I play white. This ensures that you train equally as black or white player in the long term, and spares you the need of having to decide or remember which side must be first this time. If there is any long-term effect of starting your dumbbell exercises always with the same arm, this trick will completely dilute it. 

A known book about bodyweight training written by a fictitious convict athlete, states that you can gain strength in your legs without using weights at all, by means of exercise variations that will take you from assisted squats to one-leg squats. Before moving on to the next variation, the reader is compelled to achieve lots of repetitions. For instance, before moving on to squats with feet together, you should achieve two sets of 30 normal (bodyweight only) squats. I haven't seen that approach anywhere else. I wonder if it has any solid foundation. I ask this because I have been adding reps during months, and now I am performing two sets of 20 bodyweight squats. I hope I am not loosing my time. 

Any explanation or reference about systematic rest periods introduced in a strength program would be interesting. (Remark, the day after: Ouch, feeling DOMS everywhere... If a fly landed on my pecs now, I could cry) 

Set the alarm clock at the very same hour each day (including sunday). Avoid caffeine and naps. Each morning write down the approximate hours you went to bed and the hour you felt asleep the night before. If the alarm clock woke you up today, go to bed tonight half an hour earlier than yesterday. There comes a day when you wake up a bit earlier than the clock. Go on with the experiment and go to bed half an hour earlier than the day before anyway. If you wake up one hour or so earlier than the alarm, don't subtract half an hour to bedtime any more. There comes a day in which you notice that you have woken up at least one full hour earlier than the clock for several days in a row and the amount of hours you have slept each of those days is approximately uniform. That is the amount of sleep time you need. Allowing yourself any less than that means poor quality of life. Trying to sleep more than that on average will be impossible. 

There is a famous book about progressive strength training using only your body and some place to hang from. It is called Convict Conditioning. The author (under a pseudonym) claims to have spent many years in prison, training himself and training other people with bodyweight exercises uniquely. I think it is all invented, but the system he proclaims seems sound. There are between four and six exercises to master, each of them with a lot of variants in increasing difficulty. For example, for doing pushups, you would start doing them standing against a wall. After mastering 3x40 of them, you would change your hands to a bench, then to kneeling pushups and so on. Eventually, the athlete would master one-hand pushups, one-hand pullups and other exercises. There is a nice poster and graphics for the progressions here. When my tendonitis eventually heal, I think I am going to give it a try. At least all the first steps in the progressions seem nearly innocent (the author call these steps "rehabilitation" stages). Everybody seems crazy about barbell training with systems like HerniatedDisks5x5 and similar. You are free to give credit to whatever you want, but there is no doubt that, if you manage to do pullups and lots of pushups (not to mention that you progress very far an reach the ability to do one-arm pullups) you will have become really strong, and the system in this book divides the progression towards that goals in steps that (at least at first glance) seem realistic. Additionally, the book is funny, because the author hates modern bodybuilding and states a lot of controversial affirmations against it. He depicts modern bodybuilders nearly as slow, clumsy animals artificially pumped up, with their joints damaged. Of course, all is to be taken with a grain of salt, but sometimes is nice to read something from a perspective other than the cult of Rippetoe. 

I know how much that sucks because it happens to me too from time to time. I don't think it is a fully wasted workout. I am doing a linear progression. Each time when I don't get a minimum amount of sleep, I simply insert one additional rest day. When I eventually go back to the gym, I always find that it was not so terrible after all, because my linear progression has moved forward, i. e. I am still able to do some more reps, sometimes as many as I had expected, only a day or two later. So I guess that inserting one or more additional rest days sort of compensates at least partially. I believe that bad sleep slows down my progress but it does not stop it altogether. Don't get obsessed. Just do your best to get enough sleep: avoid caffeine altogether, wake up at the same exact time every day, don't work out short before going to bed (google for "sleep hygiene" for more useful tricks) and insert rest days whenever that is not possible. I would like to show you something that will convince you of not worrying so much about one isolated sleepless night. Since I started my training five months ago, I register my sleep times together with my weight, reps and so on. I have now enough data to start drawing some interesting conclusions: The first graphic shows how many hours I sleep each day vs how many hours I slept the day before. This graphic really pisses me off: as you see, sleeping more than six hours for me has often bad consequences the following night, I will not be tired enough and I won't sleep much. I have accepted that and stopped trying to get as much sleep as possible every night. This has improved my quality of life. I don't sleep much, but at least I sleep regularly now. 

Bodyweight Squat, 3xF (three sets to failure), to be replaced by Dumbbell Squat 3x8 after achieving 100 BW squats. Push-Up, 3xF, to be replaced by Hindu Push-Up after achieving 3 sets of 20 reps. I choosed push-up not only because I don't have a bench, but also because of the need to strengthen my core. One-Arm Bent-Over Row, 3x8 (after two warm-ups sets). I choosed a single-arm version, so that I can go heavier by loading a single dumbbell with all the available plates. Doorway pec stretches, neck stretches and hip flexors stretches. 

What does a weightlifting belt protects against? How exactly? I can't imagine why wearing it is better, although I have used them and, at least subjectively, I felt more safe and comfortable during the lifts. 

Remark: Perhaps many 3 rep sets with submaximal loads might elicit neural adaptations (you are essentially practicing a movement pattern, so who knows). But working out with 3RM loads is no joke, and performing many sets in a row is probably asking for injuries. Poor form in the last set of a 12RM load is not uncommon, whereas poor form under a 3RM dumbbell may send your shoulder directly to the surgeon table. My (humble and amateur) opinion is that anyone working in the very low rep range would better stick to the Bill Starr - alike systems since they have stood the test of time, e.g. Starting Strength or Stronglifts 5x5. 

Simply practising a swim style again and again does not necessarily makes you swim better. Moreover, you might be reinforcing the bad aspects in your technique. What you need to include in your workouts is swimming drills. They are special modified exercises aiming to make you focus on one single aspect of the technique at a time. Here is a random example of swimming drills but you can easily find more examples after a Google search. Now, something very important. You say: 

Bodyweight Squat, 3xF (three sets to failure), to be replaced by Dumbbell Squat 3x8 after achieving 100 BW squats. One-Arm Standing Shoulder Press, 3x8, I not only choose a one-arm version because of a single dumbbell being heavier, but also because of the additional core strengthening. Chin-Up, 3xF. It will be only negative chin-ups at the beguinning, but I hope I will be able to perform at least one chin-up after a certain number of workouts. Shoulder dislocations, neck stretches and hip flexors stretches. 

Push ups. ONLY IF THEY ARE PAINLESS. It goes without saying that, if your feel shoulder pain during push ups or any other exercise, you should stop immediately (ignoring this puts you under risk of becoming a full supraspinatus tear). Be careful not to flare your elbows out. That goes for your triceps too (you asked that in another thread). Push ups will work your chest and triceps. If you cannot exercise without pain, then you should not try it. Seek a therapist. Exercising while in pain will only worsen your condition. The pain happens because the subacromial space is reduced and the supraspinatus has no room. Trying to push through the pain will eventually lead to severe damage to that delicate muscle. If you cannot afford medical treatment, then try to rest and avoid any overhead activity with that arm, and anything that causes pain. If that is your dominant arm, learn to use the computer mouse with the other. Only after the pain has gone and is well in the past, then start exercising, but always avoiding overhead activities. 

What is the difference? Does it target different muscles? It seems to me a bit more natural for my shoulders if I change the usual grip (open grip with palms out) and do a natural grip in my shoulder press. It is the "classic" picture I had in mind about that exercise, specially when alternating hands:
