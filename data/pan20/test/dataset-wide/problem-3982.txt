You may get what you need from various papers on the equivariant Riemann-Roch theorem applied to your G-linearized sheaf $T_X$. For example, look at the papers of Borne and/or Ellingsrud-Lonstead. 

The paper by Alessandro Verra (Math. Ann. 276 (1987), no. 3, 433â€“448) gives a very precise description of all fibers of the Prym map $\mathcal{R}_3\to \mathcal{A}_2$ from which the answer to your question can be obtained. Although your count of constants luckily works in this case, it does not work in general for nodal quartic surfaces. For example, it is not true that a general curve of genus 3 is realized as a plane section of a Weddle 6-nodal quartic surface. It is an open problem to find a condition when the map from the dual $\mathbb{P}^3$ to $\mathcal{}M_3$ given by taking a plane section of a fixed normal quartic surface is generically injective. 

There is a paper of Hotta and Kashiwara which identifies the "geometric" constructions people have mentioned with an "algebraic" one which came from Harish-Chandra's study of characters (invariant eigendistributions is the term I think). This gives you an explicit description of the D-module Rf_*(O) associated to the Springer resolution, one for the D-modules on the whole Lie algebra associated to the Grothendieck resolution on the whole Lie algebra, and proves how the two are related via the Fourier transform. For sl_n this sheaf decomposes into simple summands corresponding to the middle extension of the structure sheaf of each nilpotent orbit. At least that these modules are the only possibilities follows from the GL_n equivariance of the Springer resolution: the constituents therefore have to be GL_n equivariant, and the equivariant fundamental groups are trivial in this case. If you work with SL_n, then on the regular orbit the equivariant fundamental group is isomorphic to the centre of SL_n, and in some sense this case is responsible for all the nontrivial equivariant local systems (Lusztig's generalized Springer correspondence arose from trying to understand related things). The upshot though is that the simple GL_n-equivariant D-modules on the nilcone are the simple summands of the Springer sheaf. Now one way of saying Springer theory is that the Springer sheaf's decomposition into irreducibles is governed by the action of W the Weyl group on it (i.e. by the isotypic components of this action). Thus understanding the W-action on this sheaf gives a way of trying to understand these simple D-modules which is different from simply trying to calculate middle extensions. 

This avoids use of Christoffel symbols and index argument by re-characterizing the torsion free property. The following is one definition for a torsion-free connection. Let $\tau:TM \to M$ be the tangent bundle projection. A torsion free connection is a splitting of $T(TM) = H(TM) \oplus V(TM)$ where $V(TM) = {\rm kernel}(T \tau) \equiv TM \oplus TM$ (see Kolar,Michor,Slovak (1993)). The covariant derivative associated to this splitting is given by $\frac{Dv}{Dt} = {\rm pr_2} \left( {\rm ver}( \frac{dv}{dt} ) \right)$ where ${\rm ver}:TM \to VM$ is the projection onto $VE \equiv TM \oplus TM$ and $\rm pr_2$ is the projection onto the second factor of $TM \oplus TM$. The torsion-free property manifests from the fact that given any surface embedding $m: (s,t) \mapsto m(s,t) \in M$ we observe $\frac{D}{Dt} ( \partial_s m) = \frac{D}{Ds}( \partial_t m)$ by the equality of mixed partials. Consider the map $h^{\uparrow}: TM \to T^{(2)}M$ given by $h^{\uparrow}(v_0) = \left.\frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0}(v(t))$ where $v(t)$ is the geodesic with initial condition $v_0 \in TM$. Then (I think) the Levi-Cevita is given by $H(TM) = h^{\uparrow}(TM)$. Clearly, this is a horizontal space, and thus a well-defined connection. 

A couple of things: Springer theory does not give a bijection between orbits of the nilpotent cone and irreducible representations of the Weyl group outside of type A: in general, there is an injective map from the irreducible representations of the Weyl group to the set of equivariant irreducible local systems on nilpotent orbits (but it is not necessarily surjective). For the action on other representations, there is a paper by Misha Grinberg called "A generalization of Springer theory using nearby cycles" which generalizes Springer theory to a class of polar representations V, which behave sufficiently like case of the adjoint representation. From this point of view, you do not need the resolutions. In fact in a sense his results show that sometimes there cannot be a resolution: he proves that the Fourier transform of the nearby cycles sheaf is an intersection cohomology sheaf, and this is the analogue of the sheaf you get from the Grothendieck resolution in the ordinary Springer theory. However, in the case of symmetric spaces, he also computes the monodromy action on the local system determining the intersection cohomology sheaf, and shows that it does not have to be semisimple. A consequence of this is that the local system cannot arise from a finite cover, and thus does not come from some sort of resolution. A similar phenomenon was notice by Grojnowski in his thesis on character sheaves on symmetric spaces. 

The Koopman operator is bracket preserving with respect to the canonical Poisson bracket on $C^{\infty}(M)$. Formally, this implies the dual operator (the Frobenius-Perron operator) is a Poisson automorphism with respect to the Lie-Poisson structure on $\bigwedge^{2n}(M)$. 

Here is a recent example which I enjoyed. Joris Vankerschaver and Melvin Leok studied point vortices on the sphere (A Novel Formulation of Point Vortex Dynamics on the Sphere: Geometrical and Numerical Aspects). This may have applications in geophysical fluid dynamics where conservation of circulation plays a role. In anycase, the symplectic manifold of concern is $S^2$ with the volume form. The non-exactedness of this symplectic manifold provides a problem when one desires to construct a variational integrator (as the nature of variational principles in such spaces is tricky). They ultimately invokes the Hopf fibration $\pi: {\rm SU}(2) \to S^2$ to pull-back the dynamics to ${\rm SU}(2)$ which allows one to use do everything on a closed symplectic manifold. 

The isn't true: there's a theorem of Stafford which says that any left ideal in the Weyl algebra is generated by two elements so if your claim was true, then the singular support would have to have dimension at least 2n-2 always, which of course isn't the case if n>2. 

This goes back to Jimbo I think. A reference is: "A q-difference analogue of $U(\mathfrak g)$, Hecke algebra and the Yang-Baxter equation'', Lett. Math. Phys. 11 (1986). It has been much studied though, so there are lots of subsequent papers, some of which might be closer to what you are looking for? For example this paper studies an analogue of Schur-Weyl duality for "walled Brauer algebras", and this paper studies a two-parameter version. 

One way to see this is the following. Let $U$ be the complement of the points $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ in $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$. The fundamental group $\pi_1(U)$ is generated by elements $\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_n,\gamma_\infty$ with relation $\gamma_\infty^{-1} = \gamma_1\cdots \gamma_n$. Consider the character $\chi:\pi_1(U)\to \mathbb{C}^*$ defined by $\chi(\gamma_i) = e^{2\pi m_i/d}, i = 1,\ldots,n$, $\chi(\gamma_\infty) = e^{-2\pi M/d}$, where $M = \sum m_i$. Let $V$ be the quotient of the universal cover of $U$ by the kernel of $\chi$. The normalization of your curve is isomorphic to the normalization of $\mathbb{P}^1$ in $V$. It is a smooth complete curve on which the cyclic group of order $d$ acts as the Galois group with quotient $\mathbb{P}^1$. The ramification over $\infty$ is defined by the value of $\chi$ at $\gamma_\infty$, i.e. $e^{2\pi M/d}$. It is trivial, and hence the cover is unramified over $\infty$ if and only if $d|M$. The ramification index is equal M\mod d.$ 

I'm commenting on part 4) of your question really I think: Harish-Chandra was interested in studying the unitary dual, but in the process realized that the whole unitary structure was rather more than one needed to carry around, and moreover, that it was necessary also to consider representations which were not necessarily unitary, and in this wider context the analytic issues of when to consider two representations "equivalent" intrude more prominently (because, for example, there are lots of different kinds of function spaces on a given G-space). The notion of "admissible module" -- a module where each irreducible representation of the maximal compact subgroup occurs with finite multiplicity gave a natural class of representations which includes all unitary representations, and once in this class it is pretty natural to restrict attention to the action to the action of the Lie algebra g, and the maximal compact K (as the Lie algebra acts on K-finite vectors). Thus certainly all the motiviation for the notion of a (g,K)-module must be due to Harish-Chandra, but I'm not sure if he actually abstracts the idea in his papers. I can't tell from BGG's original paper if they are thinking of category O in the context of (g,K)-modules: their stated motivation is much more from modular representation theory. One nice reference for the representations of real groups is the book "Representation Theory of Lie groups" from the Park City summer school -- for example there's an article by Knapp and Trapa which discusses the work of Harish-Chandra. Also, I'd just like to mention that the idea of considering the pair (g,K) where g is the Lie algebra and K is the maximal compact of a real Lie group G is quite natural if one considers that the g action contains the infinitesimal information while the maximal K is a retract of G, and so one could hope that its action captures enough of the "global" information in the representation. (I think it was Graeme Segal who pointed this out to me -- perhaps an obvious comment for him, but I found it insightful and at least psychologically useful). 

Let $Q$ be a manifold, and let $X_{EL}$ be a second order vector-field on $TQ$ derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation, $$ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q} } \right) - \frac{ \partial L}{\partial q}=0,$$ for some Lagrangian $L:TQ \to \mathbb{R}$. Then for any $\alpha \neq 0$ and any $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ we can observe that the Lagrangian $L' = \alpha L + \beta$ yields the same vector-field $X_{EL}$. So the isotropy group (acting on the space of Lagrangians) which leaves the Euler-Lagrange equatiosn unchanged appears to include $( \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} , \cdot) \ltimes (\mathbb{R},+)$. Is this the entire group? If you prefer, I'd be happy to hear the answer to the same question posed on the Hamiltonian side (i.e. what is the group of transformations of Hamiltonians which leave Hamiltonian vector-fields unchanged) 

A couple of things (I meant to just have this as a comment but it got too long): I think with regard to the first fact, a lot of people realised it all around the same time -- the article by Springer which Ben mentions does all the calculations needed, as he says, but doesn't state the result, while an article not long after by Lusztig and Vogan in 1983 states the result at the end, and it's mentioned elsewhere in the literature that Brylinski also proved it (and I can't believe Beilinson and Bernstein didn't know also). It's now, however, textbook stuff thanks to the book by Hotta Tanisaki and Takeuchi. As to the second, I think Ben is overcomplicating things a little. If I say B-equivariant perverse sheaves, that will force the $\mathfrak h$-semisimplicity, which is what you need e beyond say the equivalence which is proved in the paper of Kashiwara-Brylinski. Of course Ben is right to point out that more care needs to be taken with the derived categories, but there are other references for that -- e.g. Bernstein and Lunts paper. The other classic reference that should be mentioned here is the paper of Beilinson and Bernstein on the Jantzen filtration, which discusses a lot of the issues related to central characters (e.g. considering the centre acting trivially or nilpotently etc.) 

Building upon Peter's answer, An Atiyah algebroid, or transitive Lie algebroid is one answer to your question. 

Just as a side-note. The proposition does not imply that every symplectomorphism of $T^*M$ is a cotangent lift of a diffeomorphism on $M$. As a counter example, let $\sigma$ be a non-zero closed one-form on $M$ and consider the map $F(x,p) = (x,p + \sigma(x))$. Notes that $F$ is not the cotangent lift of any diffeomorphism on $M$. Also $F^*d \theta = d(F^*\theta) = d( \sigma^H + \theta) = d\sigma^H + d\theta = d\theta$ where $\sigma^H$ is the one-form on $T^*M$ obtained by horizontal lift. Needless to say, if $\sigma$ is closed, then so is $\sigma^H$. Thus $F$ preserves the canonical symplectic form $d\theta$.
