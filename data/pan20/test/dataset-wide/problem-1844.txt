I'm asking on behalf of a person I know. Honest. He's looking for a job, probably entry-level. This would be a good time to start searching out seasonal/holiday jobs. However, he's going to be out of state during the month of November. This opens up a number of issues. 1) Interviewers sometimes ask if the candidate has any "vacation" time planned. He'll have to say "Yes, the whole month of November." Is there anything he can do to counteract that? 2) I think he should try to get a temporary job where he'll be in November. He'll be living with a local family, but he won't be a resident. Will there be any legal issues that make this difficult? 3) When he gets back at the beginning of December, I suspect most holiday jobs will be already be filled. What industries or types of jobs are likely to still have openings? 

First, you should be accurately reporting the hours you work. Depending on where you work, falsifying a timesheet (even if you're underreporting) could be illegal, and if nothing else you're currently not giving the company an accurate picture of what you spend your day doing. You shouldn't go to your manager and just say you don't like this work. Everyone has to do some stuff they don't like doing, and the response will probably be "Too bad." What you should do is tell him that you're concerned about your ability to give your best effort towards productive work on the project when you're spending so much time training new people. If you start accurately reporting your hours, even if you're salaried exempt, you can point to these reports and say "I spent X hours per week doing training over this time period, which lead me to do Y hours of overtime. I appreciate the trust you've shown in me with this added responsibility, but I'm concerned about how these extra tasks are affecting my productivity on the project. Is it possible to get someone else to help out with training new recruits?" However, if your timesheet shows that you're getting all your work done in the normal number of hours, your manager will probably ask why the timesheet says one thing and you're telling him another. Also, this is based off the assumption that you're okay with doing the work, but it's just taking up too much time. If you're actually just uncomfortable with training people period, that's a different discussion that needs to be had, but it will probably have implications for your future and advancement within the company if you're unwilling to take on this kind of added responsibility. 

I get lots of job postings from agencies, many of whom I'm not familiar with. I've heard it said (on this forum and elsewhere) that many such postings (and those on sites like Monster) are not for real potential jobs; they're either a way for the agency to build up a database of resumes, or maybe the hiring company is researching the talent pool or something. Is there a way to tell if a job is fake? I assume that if I see the same job from multiple agencies, they didn't make it up. Although maybe the hiring company did. 

A better question would be "In addition to sending my resume by e-mail, should I ALSO send it by mail or courier (and in the cover letter, make it clear that I also applied electronically")? I don't know if that's necessarily the best approach, but it has all the advantages that the other posters say about e-mailing resumes; plus you get a bit more attention. The only disadvantage is you might still look like a kook. 

I understand that it is polite to say 'excuse me' after you sneeze, and to say 'bless you' to someone after they sneeze. In situations where someone (possibly) yourself seem to sneeze incessantly, do you need to keep saying 'excuse me' or to say 'bless you' to the other person? I assume that once is usually enough to indicate that you are aware of the etiquette. Is it less polite to say it just once or not to say it at all? 

Being in the right or wrong job is conditional on what your expectations and objectives are. If you don't have one, then it would be hard to know whether this was true or not. I think it is about finding the right balance between what you WANT and what the company NEEDS from you. If you feel like you are getting what you want to providing what the company needs, then all is well. I think you realize that perhaps luck has more to do with skills in getting into these types of roles, so the important thing is to continue developing your skills (not just technical, but interpersonal as well) and set goals for what you want to achieve with your career and let that guide you rather than your feelings and assumptions. At the end of the day, no one is irreplaceable, and in the end people will leave either because they have had enough or they were proactive enough to want to find something better. I don't know of people who are perfectly happy with their job, but they usually have other motivations to keep them there. 

I can't say I know the best thing to do, but I'd love to hear that you went back to them and said: "I have to confess, when you asked how much I made before, I exaggerated the amount. I'm sorry about that, but to be honest I was afraid that if I told you the real amount, you'd make me an offer that was too low. I've heard that happens, and I really feel I'm worth X." "I wouldn't be surprised if you're no longer interested in me, but if by some chance you are, I was actually making Y. But I'm afraid I'm not comfortable showing you my salary sheet." "Again, I apologize for not being completely honest before." 

As has been noted already, there are plenty of different ways to go about this. My boss has "Thanks, [his name]" at the end of every email. I've seen people who default to Regards, Best Regards, and sometimes even just "BR" as well. If I'm sending an email to people in my office, who I see every day, usually I put "Thanks," above my standard signature. Emails that are a matter of record, e.g. notices of changes to drawings, usually include the PDF and my signature and nothing else. When I email colleagues in my company but in another office whom I don't know personally, I usually use "Regards,". What this really boils down to is, no one cares that much. If you're seriously in doubt, I would err on the side of being more formal and ending everything with "Regards". However, it's unlikely that the word you pick to end your emails will affect your career and peoples' image of you unless it's a profanity or exceedingly rude. 

In some ways this is almost like a credibility/reliability check on an employee, unless it is relevant to the work that you are doing. I guess it also depends on the type of social media they are referring to, since there are also professional groups or networks online like LinkedIn and StackExchange, even Deviant Art, Behance, Dribbble and others that are specific to particular professions. I would even consider KickStarter or CrowdSpring as social media related information that an employer would find of interest. 

A profile in StackOverflow (as show in the profile in Careers 2.0) seems to be a pretty good way of presenting your level of experience and expertise in anything to do with programming. I also like the fact that it shows the engagement you've had with other members and different communities, which gives them a good indication about your other characteristics and skills. 

It seems that you actually have two problems here. First is an internal issue, that the support team is directing problems to you when you don't have the time to address them due to the new projects you're working on. You need to work with your manager to identify who internally can handle questions from the support team if that's something you don't have the time to deal with. As far as addressing your unavailability to your clients, I think you just need to be direct, but then also help them direct their issue to someone who can assist them. It doesn't have to be long or overly apologetic. Something along the lines of "I apologize for the problem you're having [if that's appropriate] and I value the relationship we have. Unfortunately, my time is currently consumed developing new projects, and I am not able to give your question the dedication it deserves." Then, depending on how your support system works, either CC a support representative and introduce them to your client, or provide them with the relevant info for how to file a ticket. My last bit of advice would be to try and keep them in touch with a real person during and after that hand-off. Think about how many commercials there are with people frustrated about dealing with an automated system. If they get the idea that they're sending their support issue into a this mysterious automated system, they'll reach out to you because they know you're a real person and have helped them in the past. If you can say "I know Bob in support, Bob is a good person, he's knowledgeable and helpful, and I trust him. I've told him about your problem, and he'll take care of you." that's going to make them feel a lot better than "Please send this e-mail to support@company.com instead." The feasibility of this may depend on the size of your company, but if you're filling as many roles as you say, I imagine you at least know a few of the people in the support department.
