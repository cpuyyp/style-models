In professional play - there are rules about how many points (6) must be played in between towel breaks (to wipe off sweat and what not). The "hand rub" is one tactic or ritual used to wipe a sweaty hand off on the table - usually up near the net on a part of the table the ball is not likely to come in contact with. It doesn't necessarily mean their hand is sweaty though. Some players do it to keep themselves in a rhythm, and do it just as a mental tick or something to keep them focused. Sometimes you'll also see them do it near the baseline of the table if some of the rubber nubs from their paddle have fallen onto the table during play. It is definitely not something "required" by any means, rather just something that some players do out of habit. 

Under the official rules, it's often (like you emphasized) the intent behind the action that is judged, rather than the action itself - in terms of carrying the ball or a double-hit. Tennis rules follow a sort of "good faith" motto - that a carry or double-hit won't count against you as long as you didn't do it deliberately. Having said that, if you feel you gained an unfair advantage from one of these actions, you can always (and should) concede the point to your opponent. Hits by the frame are definitely allowed - so you are correct. In fact, the ball can hit any part of the racquet, including the throat or the handle as long as it hits only the racquet and not your hand or any part of your body. See Rule 24i where it says "except the racquet". Notice the wording there doesn't say "the strings of the racquet" - that wording is on purpose. 

Wikipedia says, "In the event of forfeiture, the score is recorded as "9 to 0", as per rule 2.00 of the Major League Baseball Rules Book." The major league rules (page 16) state, "A FORFEITED GAME is a game declared ended by the umpire-in-chief in favor of the offended team by the score of 9 to 0, for violation of the rules." As for the number 9 - it seems to relate to the number of scheduled innings played out in a professional standard 9 inning game. For softball and little league, for example, the score would be 7-0 since those games schedule only 7 innings of play. I also found something that said that in the event that the forfeiting team is trailing in the score, the score will remain as-is. So, if the team that had to forfeit was behind, say 5-1 - the final score would be recorded as 5-1. I believe the "9-0" score is the rule for games that are forfeited and never begin playing out or where the score is tied. 

Some younger players (teenagers, typically) that are good enough to qualify for pro level events that pay prize money have to make a decision about whether to accept the money or not in order to maintain their "amateur" status in the sport since playing college tennis usually means you cannot have been considered a "pro" before. 

This means after the ball passes beyond the end line (end of the table) - the point is over and whoever hit the ball beyond the end line loses the point. Obviously if it were legal to win a point just by hitting your opponent with the ball, some crazy strategies would come into play - for the worse of the game. 

Monofilament (mono = one) strings are one single strand of string, extruded during the string manufacturing process as a single solid strand. Multifilament (multi = many) strings are several (usually hundreds) of tiny filaments inside a coating or sheath - no single solid strand. What the guy in that video is saying is that monofilament string made from polyester material is made for a single purpose: to be as durable of a string as possible. Players such as (like the guy says) Rafael Nadal use monofilament polyester strings because they last the longest when you hit with an extreme amount of spin and strength, as Nadal does. So the monofilament poly string lasts him longer than any other string would. You can read up more about different string types (materials and construction) here. 

I used to play tennis 3 or 4 days a week and sweat a lot too and I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area where it's 100+ F four or five months a year so I experienced the same thing as you with my dri-ft and clima-cool tennis clothing. Here is something you can try that I had some good results with: 

No major (a.k.a grand slam) tournament has ever been cancelled due to bad weather. I've never heard of any standard one week tournament being cancelled due to bad weather, either. Since tennis tournaments are held all over the world, they tend to be scheduled during times when the weather is good in whatever part of the world the tournament is being held. For example - Paris in late May/early June for the French Open, where you might get a little bit of rain but it's generally good weather. Some other examples are the Australian Open in January during the Australian summer when it's hot and sunny - the same thing with the Indian Wells Masters series event in March in the southern California desert when the weather is nice and warm. The US Open had a streak where for 4 straight years the men's final was delayed until the following Monday because it rained on the final Sunday. That is how most weather delays for majors are handled - the matches will just be delayed until the weather is good enough to play. It has, however, prompted the USTA to construct a roof over Arthur Ashe stadium recently because of the delays weather has caused over the years. 

Yonex Supergrap: The most tacky overgrip there is. Slightly more tacky than Wilson Overgrip. You don't want to wrap it too tight though, or it won't stay tacky as well or absorb moisture as well. Durability is decent - I usually put a new one on after about 5+ hitting sessions (and I would be considered a frequent overgrip changer - I love the feeling of hitting with a new fresh overgrip). Wilson Overgrip: Everything I said about Yonex Supergrap applies to Wilson Overgrip too - just that I find Wilson overgrip to be a little less tacky after it's first put on. Tournagrip: Very popular among higher level players and players with sweaty hands. Has the best absorption of any grip I've ever played with. Unfortunately it's lower on the tackiness scale IMO - and the tackiness is really important to me. 

This article articulates your point and provides some of the data you might be looking for with both the male (ATP) and female (WTA) tours. As of now (July 2016) there is only one teenager ranked inside the top 50 in the world on the ATP World Tour - Alexander Zverev at a ranking of 28. Dominic Thiem is also currently a notable youngster since he is ranked #8 at the age of 22. Both Zverev and Thiem have jumped to their current career-high rankings recently though, so they are not likely to factor into many "average age" calculations done on the age of top 10 or top 50 players unless those calculations were performed on recent rankings data. As an avid fan and follower of the sport of Tennis, I can say that the trend of the top players being older in age does not surprise me that much given the relatively recent advances in many areas of the sport in regards to fitness, strategy, strings and global competition. These are all things that get tweaked and refined to perfection over years of trial and error. Not to mention players adjusting to the demands the sport puts on them by the media, long schedule and travelling all over the world. Fitness Given the ridiculously long schedule Tennis players endure, today's top players are training year-round. They've also put in the time to know exactly how much to train without over-training and have developed highly specific training routines that science has shown to benefit the skills in demand for tennis players like optimal breathing patterns (no joke), balance, hand-eye coordination, core strength & stability, etc. Today's top players are also making use of recovery techniques that weren't known of or available to top players in the past such as ice baths, oxygen rich recovery chambers, Kinesio tape and more. Strategy Younger players don't have the benefit of a sort of wisdom that older players have obtained from having already played on the tour for years. The more matches and different opponents you have under your belt, the more you know about an opponent's tendencies (and weaknesses). The more veteran players are also more likely to have a coach helping them scout opponents. Tennis is also a sport where knowing yourself well is a benefit to the mental aspect the sport brings with it. Knowing your own tendencies and bad habits are key in helping you avoid mistakes. In pro tennis the margins between victory and defeat are commonly so thin that the player usually making fewer mistakes determines the winner and loser. Strings Luxilon and polyester strings have changed the way players can hit the ball - especially on the service return - without worrying as much about the ball going out. These strings didn't hit the market until the late 90's - right when players like Federer and Roddick started their professional careers. Global Competition Tennis has players hailing from many more countries now than it used to. Back in the 80's and 90's, tennis players from Serbia hardly existed, let alone atop the rankings. Now you have the top player in the world being Serbian as well as multiple players in the top 100 from smaller European countries like Serbia, Portugal, Czech Republic and Croatia, as well as Asian countries like Japan and China starting to produce top players (e.g Kei Nishikori). Although I don't have any hard evidence backing up my opinion on this - I think this makes it tougher for young pros to reach the top of the rankings as they have more travelling and conditions to acclimate to on their ascent to the top. Big tournaments in cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo are also now a thing that didn't exist in pro tennis a couple of decades ago.
