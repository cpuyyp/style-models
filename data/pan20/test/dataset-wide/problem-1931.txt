You can always recover to some extent from a miscue in an interview, but the key is timing. First, I would agree with your assessment that your response was not the greatest thing you could possibly have said in that situation. But, learn from it (don't do it again!) and move on. Also, more often than not in phone interviews, not everyone (especially if there are multiple people in the line) is hanging on your every word, and more so at the end (it's often a time for compilation of notes before moving on to the next person to call). So, how to recover from a miscue? Some thoughts: 

No, unless you are applying for a job as a card-memorizer, or have worked as a card-memorizer in the past and this is one of the bullet points you are using to describe your duties and responsibilities in this position. In areas of the resume devoted to lists of skills and qualifications, again this would only be listed if it is a core skill (e.g. "something you might see in a job ad") for the position to which you are applying. If you think such a skill adds tremendous value to your candidacy -- it sets you apart from others in a meaningful way -- you might mention it briefly in your cover letter. 

As a hiring manager who is also 100% responsible for the content of the job ad (this is not always the case, as other answers have noted), "years of experience" is meaningful to me. However, exact matches for years of experience is not so meaningful to me. That is not the case for strict, by-the-book HR screening processes and resume matching, which is still quite prevalent in many industries. Taking a look at your example -- "Minimum 5 years experience with xyz technology in a commercial role" -- if I had written this (which I wouldn't, exactly), what I would care about is the plural of years, the specific technology, and the "commercial" part. What that says is "we want someone who is not just out of school, who uses or has used the same technology stack we do, and who has worked in a team, in a production environment, and in general knows what that entails." The use of "5" instead of "3" in terms of years of experience says to me they do want someone with at least a few years under their belt -- if you're just out of school or internship, that's not really what they want. If you see "3" in terms of years of experience, if you're good and professional, but only have a solid year of work, they could very well take a look at you. In general, there's a difference between 3, and 5, and 7 in terms of expectations of skill level, teamwork, knowledge of processes, responsibility levels, and so on, even if the numbers don't precisely line up. As an example, here is a "requirements" statement in one of my job ads: 

Clarity, transparency, and consistency by both you and your employer is what makes telecommuting a success for all -- you get to be productive, the company gets to reap that productivity. For some, a hard split between Work and Home will be necessary, for others, it won't -- it might not be best to focus so much on the hard separation and instead work on a comfortable integration. 

In other words, ensuring students are not wasting a recruiter's time with fluff, at the point in time when fluff might be all they have. But these guidelines for entry-level job seekers tie in to the general advice given in the Monster.com link used by another respondent, "The One-Page Resume vs. the Two-Page Resume", which focuses on understanding the short attention span of reviewers and showing the most recent and relevant accomplishments, among other things. The guidance given to undergrads, that you and probably many others were given, is not materially different than the guidance we get as experienced, working adults, in which we must understand the context in which we are applying (e.g. is it a cattle-call job in which first, quick, impressions matter most, or a more specialized advanced position in which greater detail is both desired and beneficial?) and tailor our resume to both the position itself and that context. This means making informed rhetorical choices which in the end may result in the use of a resume longer than 1-2 pages. In some cases, that's just fine; I always suggest having two resumes in your back pocket: one made for a recruiter's easy scanning of skills and experience in the last 7-10 years (if you've been a working professional that long, and if the jobs in that timeframe are relevant to the job you're applying to now), and one to send to the recruiter and the hiring manager after you've made it to the "let's talk more" stage and giving a richer and more detailed picture of yourself is appropriate. 

Stop worrying about proving your productivity and just be productive. Remember why you wanted to work remotely in the first place. 

Typically, it is the cover letter than enables you to tailor your presentation of yourself to specific positions; your cover letter is the bridge between the job ad and your resume, highlighting the points of intersection and generally showing where you fit. However, there are ways to tailor your resume as well. Having examined the ad and learned a little bit about the company that you are applying to, you can work with the information on your resume and move it around or add information to highlight or make more clear those areas that are of special interest to the employer. Even if you have less to talk as an entry-level or junior-level candidate than someone with 20 years of experience, it's still possible to make the appropriate rhetorical choices with your information that will cause the reviewer to stand up and take note. For example, let's say that you have a standard line about education, a few lines about skills/qualifications, and then one or two entries about jobs you've held. Let's say that you have the jobs listed before the skills, but you come across a position that matches your skillset so perfectly that you can't help but put it first. That's an example of targeting your resume, even with a limited amount of info about yourself overall. It's not about embellishing, it's just about prioritizing what about you matches what the company wants. 

The way to do this is not to lose it in the first place, and the way you would lose your integrity is to lie (or use "half-truths", as you say). So, when your instinct tells you something is wrong, listen to it -- the examples above show that you have good instincts in this area. 

The answer to #2 is going to put you on a track to figuring out how best to balance work and life, because the answers are different depending on the reason you're doing it. For example (and these are generalities but still show the overall point): 

In the United States, it is unlikely that a lack of credit history will keep you from your first job (or entry-level types of jobs). Not all employers check credit as part of a background check, and when they do, it is not for all levels and types of positions. In general, employers tend to check credit to verify that you do not have liens against you/bankruptcies/foreclosures (potential sign of irresponsibility or bad judgement), that you aren't using all of the credit you do have or aren't late on your payments (potential sign of bad budgeting) and other reasons that could speak to your financial abilities and/or character as a potential employee. Unless you're looking to break into banking, finance, accounting, or jobs of that nature, the lack of a credit history isn't likely to harm you whatsoever. If you are looking to work in banking, finance, accounting, or similar industries/positions, you should probably think about establishing a credit history of some sort sooner rather than later, and also just in general you might think about it (but with a less urgent time frame) -- perhaps talk to someone at your local bank or credit union for the best way to go about this for your personal circumstances. Also, note that you do have a credit history: it says you have no open lines of credit, but (presumably) you also don't have any liens, bankruptcies, foreclosures, student loans, auto loans, or late payments on anything! 

A bit of background for this: I used to teach professional and technical writing to international students in an American university, and resume creation was one of the key aspects of this class. We talked about this a lot, and what follows is generally what I taught in that class. First, you're absolutely correct that there are multiple aspects to language, and the more you do on your resume to break these elements out, the better. Discussing language proficiency in terms of reading, writing, and speaking would be completely adequate; listening is a bonus, and more difficult to quantify (and quite frankly, it's not been my experience that companies, rather than academic institutions, understand what a proficiency measurement in "listening" really means). So let's look at how to describe language proficiency in terms of reading, writing, and speaking. If you can claim native language proficiency in one or more aspects of one or more languages (that's quite possible), that's a commonly-understood term. After that, as you note, it gets a little fuzzy. Describing proficiency in terms of years of use (as one of your examples) is not terribly useful at all. For instance, let's say for the sake of argument, that I studied French in college for 4 years. If you dropped me in the middle of France, I wouldn't do all that well. I could probably buy some wine and cheese. But if one of my mythical classmates went to France after one year of college classes, was immersed in the culture, and lived there for several months with nothing to do but work with the language, their 1.5 years with the language would be significantly more attractive to an employer than my 4. So, numbers are out. That leaves general terms like fluent, proficient, competent, and a host of others, as you note. There are several tests and frameworks of language proficiency that offer guidelines that you can use, and (more importantly), hiring institutions might be using as well. One example is the Interagency Language Roundtable scale (ILR) which describes how the US Government defines levels of language proficiency for foreign service. "Elementary" proficiency would be something like my example of being able to get around, minimally, and to be polite, but not much more than that ("able to use questions and answers for simple topics within a limited level of experience"). However, a level like "Professional working proficiency" includes things like "able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most conversations on practical, social, and professional topics", and would be close to (if not a bit higher than) what a non-Government job might refer to as "business level". There is a similar framework used in Europe, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL). My recommendation to anyone trying to figure out how describe their language proficiency would be to let one of these frameworks do the talking for you, and to reference whichever one you're using right there in your resume. If you're applying for jobs in the US, for the government or otherwise, use the ILR scale; if in Europe, use the CEFRL scale, and so on; the idea is to get information across as clearly as possible, and limit the amount of work/number of questions your interviewers have to go through to get the information they need. So, on a resume, it would be completely reasonable to have a section for Language Skills that looked like this:
