Rather than acrobatic movements with your bike, could you not find a cycle lane to your destination to avoid this? I had the same problem as you but got over it once I used cycle lane for part of my journey. They are usually better in this kind of circumstances. I would recommend you do that for once. I know that it would be mental, but could you possible post a picture of the actual road surface? We could give you an improved answer based on that. If you really need to be on the road, the best way is to balance out the concussion between yourself and the bike. YOUR SAFETY IS FIRST, you can buy another bike not your limbs or arms. A solution would be to determine if you can streer your way around the contiguous cracks and potholes. This will help you to improve your attention to the road surface too. BE CAREFUL OF THE CARS BEHIND YOU. If this is not possible, the other way (which has worked for me so far) is to find course through that specific road which would result into less number of bumps and concussions to yourself and your bike. What you mentioned (i.e. lifting yourself off the seat for a short while to avoid experiencing the concussion) works sometimes, but may be not in favour of road bikes. MTB users often perform a basic bicycle lift where they lift the front wheels first, raise themselves from the saddle a little bit, dash back, and perform a jump around obstacles. This is however, not recommended for road bikes....... I would have thought. There may be youtube videos where people have done this type of safe cycling around cracks and holes. I also recommend you find them. Again, post some pictures if possible please. 

The posts that I found on Bicycles SE and youtube are not really helping me for this. My brakes run out of tuning a bit faster than I thought. If I am doing something wrong, a slap on the wrist will be appreciated! TIA UPDATE SINCE @DANIELRHICKS POSTED HIS ANSWER I have replaced my brakes whilst you folks were reading this and resulted into the followings now. Could anyone tell me if it seems wrong? Also, I am not sure if angle of my V arm of the brake is correct. Do I need to fix that too? 

Lowering the saddle to the lowest level and see how it affects your overall position on the bike is a good start point. Coincidentally, a colleague and friend of mine has done exactly the same, and I almost thought it was you until you mentioned about school :p. Some people would stand-and-pedal, but that is not ideal to do all the time! Another thing to try is that if your saddle slides front-and-back, see what position you require it to be fixed. This is to get your heap ergonomics right. I hope you have got your allen-key turner available at home :) UPDATE Mind you that frame sizes for road bikes and MTBs vary a bit. What I mean is that the if you want to buy a road bike, the appropriate frame size for you will be slightly bigger than its MTB counterpart (e.g. 19" road/hybrid bike fr == 18/17" MTB fr). If you are in the UK, the bike shops usually have charted measurements available for you to find out the optimum height and frame size for it. It would really help us if you give further information such as what exactly is the problem that you experience with this current frame size? Bob (or whoever the guy you spoke to) might have said things to sell a bike to you, but he could very well be right about the size. Coming back to the colleague of mine's bike, it was a carrera 18" MTB and his height is 5' 7". It was just about right, but he could have used a smaller frame. But when we adjusted the seat post height, it was alright although we could have used a slightly smaller bike size. If your round trip ride does not contain too much of steep hill climbing, you should be fine pedalling through. Again, it would be good to know what your height is and the size of bike frame you have. Try lowering your saddle first and meanwhile, let us know your height and frame size. To help you understand, I am 6' 3" and have a perfect fit bike of 19" frame (48 cm). I can probably do with a smaller frame, tried in the past. 

Before going further, ask your self this: You need to drive your UK-purchased car in the US now. OMG, US is right-hand drive but the UK is left-hand. you now need to change the position of my gear and streering wheels to the other side. Does this sound logical to you? Does it make your life comfortable? Are you gonna buy a new car now? Same logic my friend. As @DanielRHicks and hillsons said, brakes are not needed to change. I would rather focus on using the road sides correctly as US is for right-hand drive. Unless there is any law about changing the shifter positions, don't do it. Just ride as you would ride, but try to get the road side correct. 

I am not sure if this is going to be accepted as a comment or an answer, so apologies in advance and any superuser please feel free to amend it appropriately I had a condition a month ago when I braked hard, hit a pothole, somersaulted on the road, and my inner tube had a proper burst with cracks on my back tyre. I would say replace your tyre, get something like a 1200 mile puncture-proof tyres (Schwalbe ones are good) for about $40 (guess). Living in a country like UK where you can never rely on the weather, I always get my tyres replaces in case I have a nasty crack. Rain will destroy my tyre anyway, so no point using those clever crack-repairing glues. Speaking of which, for cracks like 2-3 mm you can use those glues to do the job. They are not too bad, considering that you are not riding somewhere really really hot where your tyre pressure is also affected by the temperature. If you are in a place where rain doesn't really affect your riding, you could probably get away with it. My suggestion is "Replace your tyre if possible" because your safety is not bigger than your cash :) If your bike was a Road bike (can't remember), definitely replace the tyres. Road bikes are different animal and with about 120 psi on on wheels, you don't want a cracked and damaged tyre supporting the super-pressurised inner tube! 

Once the brake pads are replaced. I opened up the nut to the maximum i.e. created the highest tension point. Adjusted the cable attatchment (i.e. the attatchment of the cable with the allen-key joint near the noodle). Slowly closed the nut inside (i.e. loosen the cable tension) so that the necessary gap between the pad and rim can be achieved, also the cable attatchment near the noodle is appropriate. 

I had exactly the same problem last year due to running into snowy roads for a week or two. The front derailleur clutch jammed. DO the following: 

Original Question What physical symptoms do I need to look for to understand that my brake is out of tuning or the cables have reached end of life? It is not necessary to consider the brake shoes in this question as I already have a previous question on bicycles SE covering that. MY USAGE I ride everyday for work and fun. I cover about 20 miles on average every week but would be doing a lot more than that. MY REASONS FOR THIS QUESTION I have been tuning my front and rear brakes by either releasing the nuts near the handle or just adjusting the cable near the brake (i.e. where the noodle is). It seems that they are running out quicker than I though (i.e. running out of tuning). I really don't know what to do anymore. I know that a really bad way to do this is just replace the brake cables, but I just almost bought the bike (November 2012). I think there are better ways of tuning and managing the brake performance. I have attached some pictures for the users to see what I am talking about.
