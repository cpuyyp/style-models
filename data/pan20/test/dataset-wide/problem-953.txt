Of course it happens elsewhere! However, I'm not sure there's a specific term, generally. Even in the "montaintop removal" country of Appalachia, there is no more prosaic term for the practice other than MTR. Too bad! It surely deserves a better term! 

Not necessarily....lots of rocks, especially quartz-rich rocks, give off a noticeable "gunpowder" smell when violently fractured. I'm not sure where it comes from but I've noticed it when manually smashing large cobbles, and in mountain gullies after rockfall. Your rock could well be a quartzite cobble. 

A geologic cross section of the Grand Canyon. Black numbers correspond to groups of formations and white numbers correspond to formations. Typically, formations are traceable across some distance. 

Explosive volcanism is ALWAYS associated felsic magmatism, only because of it's higher water content, whereas mafic magmas are much "drier". 

Looks like rutile. Commonly associated with quartz, it's a simple titanium dioxide, though less commonly red in color. Nicely posted question, BTW. 

All manner of isotopic analyses confirms that the chemical composition of the earth's atmosphere has fluctuated wildly in the past. Besides the Archean hypoxic atmospheres of 2.5 billion years ago, the late Paleozoic saw oxygen concentrations that were much higher than they are today allowing a wide variety of giant insects to thrive (simple diffusion is a large part of insect respiration). Some believe that in addition to much higher oxygen levels, a much higher air density (pressure) may have accelerated the development of flight in these insects: ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN, GIANT PALEOZOIC INSECTS AND THE EVOLUTION OF AERIAL LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE By the way, the internets are full of people who don't understand the difference between "high oxygen partial pressure" and "high atmospheric pressure". 

A turbidity current can easily account for what you've observed. It could be part of a repetitive sequence of shallow angle sloughs caused by accumulating overburden, much like the Bouma Sequences that make up a Turbidite Deposit, or it could be a one-time gravity flow caused by an earthquake. 

Yes. To be clear, this is not the same the same thing as saying that loose soils actually "amplify" seismic waves. If anything, both P waves and S waves are attenuated by unconsolidated materials. However, like eSurfsnake mentions, buildings behave poorly when soils shift randomly beneath them: one corner of a tenement may drop several feet and shear off part of the structure injuring scores of people. On the other hand, the structure may be earthquake-proof, but may not have been built on an earthquake-proof foundation, in which case, shaking the loose soil effectively "liquifies" its load-bearing properties. 

Every textbook written between about 1930 and say.....now, is pretty useless for your purposes. You'd be better served by watching many of those slick, university produced video lectures. They are filled with great motion diagrams that are un-reproducible in the pages of a two-dimensional book. After all, geosciences are largely about dynamic processes and film is a way better medium for conveying such concepts. Despite Michael's great answer, above, old geology textbooks are AWESOME! I simply cannot convey how fascinating it is to discover the state of ignorance of the world just beneath our feet displayed in many of these books. My home is festooned with old geology maps, illustrations, and field sketches taken from old folios, USGS reports, and expedition compendiums. I have a 19th century map of Devils Tower that shows the tower in cross section as part of a sill and not the volcanic neck that it is...it's a small detail at the bottom of a map and easily missed, but it's hugely important in interpreting the geology of the area. After all, can you imagine explaining to professional government geologists of the day that they mis-identified the largest iconic piece of geology in the Rocky Mountains? These old books and texts are a wealth of carefully collected local details which can be used to compare present-day environments with those observed a hundred years ago. Many old reports reference early 19th century expeditionary notes that put the lie to tightly held "truths" repeated here in the desert Southwest. They are also anthropological treasure troves filled with the state-of-mind of the times: for example, most textbooks view geology strictly in terms of mineral opportunities, others are flights of dinosaur fantasies. European paleontology textbooks are incredible works of art filled with DaVinci-esque illustrations of fossils and their modern counterparts that have yet to be equaled for detail. And the most informative textbooks? Those that expound on evolutionary processes before Darwin. This is all outright fascinating stuff! 

No....it's not so simple.....far from it. In fact, there are several rather complicated processes occurring simultaneously, none of which involve the simple transfer of heat from warm air to cool sea water, as stated by userLTK, above. From Skeptical Science: How Increasing Carbon Dioxide Heats The Ocean Sunlight penetrating the surface of the oceans is responsible for warming of the surface layers. Once heated, the ocean surface becomes warmer than the atmosphere above, and because of this heat flows from the warm ocean to the cool atmosphere above. But really, you should read the entire text for a good explanation of the process that leads to warming seas. Another important resource is found at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Physics of greenhouse effect and convection in warm oceans On average, convective regions are more humid, trap significantly more longwave radiation, and emit more radiation to the sea surface. The greenhouse effect in regions of convection operates as per classical ideas, that is, as the SST increases, the atmosphere traps the excess longwave energy emitted by the surface and reradiates it locally back to the ocean surface. The important departure from the classical picture is that the net (up minus down) fluxes at the surface and at the top-of-the atmosphere decrease with an increase in SST; that is, the surface and the surface-troposphere column lose the ability to radiate the excess energy to space. The cause of this super greenhouse effect at the surface is the rapid increase in the lower-troposphere humidity with SST; that of the column is due to a combination of increase in humidity in the entire column and increase in the lapse rate within the lower troposphere. The increase in the vertical distribution of humidity far exceeds that which can be attributed to the temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure; that is, the tropospheric relative humidity is larger in convective regions. 

Far more curious, to me at least, is why the riverbank has been incised in such a way. I suspect that permafrost riverbanks erode differently than the usual garden variety riverbanks. 

There are only a few places in the world where one finds "orbicular granites" like in this australian web photo: 

Do divergent tectonic plates destroy mountains? The short answer is "no". Erosion destroys mountains. Period. Not slumping, not faulting, not "flowing back to flatness" in the absence of compression, not sticking to a wayward plate. Just plain old, basic erosion. To fully understand the physics of rocks and the processes that lead to mountain building, you'd have to at least pick up a basic college level intro to geology. There are many good ones out there with awesome illustrations and clear explanations. On the other hand, simple videos can be useful too: You can check out these short clips from the British Geological Society for a basic view of mountain building at plate margins. To answer your question more precisely, the mountains that form at the edges of subduction zones are the result of several processes: 1) regional uplift of the overriding plate inland of the subduction boundary, 2) building of accretionary wedges from scraped materials off the subducting plate 3) Emplacement of island arc magmas as either extrusive (lavaflows) or intrusive (deep underground) plutons, and 4) Erosion, which cuts the deep channels through inherent structural weaknesses in this enormous mass of uplifted volcanic rock, exposing the sharp peaks and prominent ridges that we associate with mountains. Does reversing this subduction effectively stop these processes? Yes...sorta. And this has happened around the planet frequently enough over 4.5 billion years with the creation of at least to supercontinents, Gondwana and Pangea. I say "sorta" because the uplift is still there and the erosion continues unabated. Does reversing the subduction effectively reverse these processes in any way? No. Reversing the direction of India's movement into Tibet will not cause the Himalaya to slump back onto the sea floor. It's now chemically altered, bullet-hard, de-watered metamorphosed accretionary wedge. Only the steady grinding of glaciers and weather are going to "destroy" those mountains; the same process already occurring. Will reversing South American subduction cause the Andes to "stick" to the Nazca plate as it's pulled back out from under South America, or slump back into the ocean? That would impose a strength to oceanic crust that it doesn't have. If anything, in this new "extensional regime", oceanic crust would simply weaken, be uplifted by a shallow aesthenosphere, and likely be perforated by a mid-ocean ridge, or hotspots. Hope that helps!
