It's mostly an increase in the capillary system, as the primary function of angiogenesis is to increase the capability to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the working muscle. You don't need larger blood vessels for that, you need more. However, there are changes to the larger blood vessels (called arteriogenesis) where the larger blood vessels will increase in diameter, and thus allow them to carry more blood. Note: Both angio and arteriogenesis may or may not happen, it's not a guarantee that if you exercise both will occur. You may get some of one, the other or both, depending on how your body reacts to exercise. 

You are correct, in that the pike and handstand pushups will not involve the rear deltoids to the extent that the front and medial heads are utilized. If you do get overdeveloped, the anterior deltoids will tend to overpower the rear, pulling the shoulder forward and giving you a hunched type look. For body weight exercises, there are very limited options. The best one is some sort of a supine row, where you pull your body up towards something (Think of a pushup position on your back, pulling your upper body towards the bar). Even this requires some sort of a bar and place to prop your feet. Other things you can do at home are bent over lateral raises. Since they are not large, powerful muscles it doesn't take a lot of weight to stress them. You can save a couple of gallon milk jugs and fill them with water, that gets you to ~ 8-9 lbs (A gallon of water is 8.8 lbs). After that you can start filling them with sand. The basic function of the rear delt is transverse extension. If you raise your hands straight out in front of you at shoulder height, and then swing them out wide (like a big T) that is transverse extension. Any motion like that with stress/weight will work the rear deltoids. If you have a set of gymnastic rings you can get some fantastic bodyweight work throughout the shoulder area, but again, that requires some external equipment. 

I wouldn't cut any of your workouts, as I wouldn't consider your current training sufficient for a 10k or a half marathon. Barely sufficient for a 5k. The key to running well and safely without injury is keeping up the volume sufficiently for the events you are training for. What I would personally do is find 15-20 minutes every single day to get out the door for 2-6k. That's going to pay off way more in benefit than kludging together some makeshift schedule. As far as the injury risk, that is going to be highly dependent on you and your own running history. I know my minimum training for completing a half marathon safely is in the 25-35k range. If I want to compete at all, I need to be way higher than that. On the other side, I know some people that can run a 1:35 half marathon on 10k a week. If you happen to be one of those, then your long run and a couple short ones when you can manage may suffice. YMMV. 

There are basically four muscles (In reality there are a lot of smaller muscles involved) that comprise the "abdominals" or "core" muscles. 

Again, this is something that is subjective and going to vary from person to person. I generally monitor my HR a few times during the week first thing when I wake up, and occasionally when I'm just sitting around watching TV. These will give you baselines. When I finish a workout, I'll take my HR immediately, and once again in a minute or two. These are what you compare to when you are checking it. What you are looking for is a consistent drop. If your HR stays elevated compared to your normal trend, then you may be tired, had a harder workout than usual, weather is different, you had too much caffeine that day, etc etc. HR is a metric that is highly variable depending on a lot of conditions. For me personally, my morning resting HR is about the only one I pay attention to on a consistent basis. If it's elevated for a few days over what is normal, then I know something is off. HR is not one of my favorite training metrics to use, as there are so many different variables that can affect it day to day, or even hour to hour. 

Situps, crunches, abdominal raises will all hit most of the groups in varying intensities. You will want to use a variety of abdominal exercises to ensure that you are hitting the various muscles equally. 

In short, the answer is no, there aren't really any good cardio exercises that are upper body only and don't involve the legs without the knees. To understand, you need to know the structure of the knee, but suffice to say that there are tendons that go through the knee area and encapsulate the patella (kneecap) and there are ligaments that hold the knee together. (Tendons connect muscle to bone, ligaments connect bone to bone). Pretty much any exercise (including swimming, unless you are doing strictly pull work) is going to bend the knee to some extent and involve the muscles of the upper leg, which will in turn place stress on the knee. I would go to an orthopedist, and a physical therapist and figure out what is damaged and causing the pain, fix that, and then get back to working out regularly. 

My first thought was no, but I looked on google scholar, and surprisingly (at least to me) there is at least one study that seems to support the theory that training in low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions can promote higher fat burn. Low Intensity exercise with hypoxia - Summary: The hypoxic group lost a little over a kilogram (2.2 pounds), where the normobaric group lost very little at all. There are a few others that relate hypoxia to healing in burn patients, and a couple that suggest other complications, so I would suggest reading further before completely diving in to extreme hypoxic training. 

Calorie counting is an odd beast, in that it can be very hard to get an exact amount of calories eaten. Your best bet is to track your calories (Even down to weighing food at the beginning), activity and weight on a daily basis. For the weight, weigh yourselves at the same time and same situation each day (For example, I weigh myself in the morning after I shower), and track the trends. Educate, educate, educate. Find out exactly how much a 4 oz portion of steak is (Not much), things like that. For your base question, you want to adjust for your activity level. You need to know your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is how many calories it takes simply to lay on the couch and breath in and out all day. Then you add all your activities, and that is how many calories you get to eat if you want to maintain weight. Then adjust for your projected weight loss and monitor for a few weeks. Adjust as necessary. A couple cautions based on the information in your post: 

Yes, you can be quite fit without running. You can be greatly fit just by going to a strenuous aerobics class. What you need to consider in addition to just being fit in a cardiovascular sense is functional fitness, and by that I mean that if you bike 200 miles a day and are supremely fit, you may not be able to swim more than a couple hundred yards, or run more than a mile without feeling gassed, simply because the muscles that you use for those events will not be the same ones as used for biking. Your cardio system will function fine, but your muscular endurance for the task will be nothing. So, do what you enjoy for fitness. If you don't enjoy it, you won't keep with it. And, that way you will be fit and having fun. 

The only way to truly gain height (Assuming that you have stopped growing. An x-ray of your growth plates is the only way to determine that, although at age 30 it is extremely likely.) is for very expensive, painful and long recovery surgery. Basically they saw your bone in half, use a frame to suspend the bones a bit apart from each other and let the bone "fill in" the gap. This costs anywhere from $25-100,000 US, requires a 6-9 month rehab process and might get you an inch. Maybe. My advice would be to make peace with yourself, realize that your height is not abnormal and concentrate on making everything that you have look good. 

Barbell squat - This is basically king exercise for the lower body. Hits quads, hamstrings, glutes and calves. If you have functional impediments that prevent squats, hip sleds and similar machines can be substituted. Deadlift - Hits the hamstrings, glutes and the erector spinae (Lower back). This will also help with the posture and fatigue that comes with long saddle time. Calf raises - Do these both standing and seated. Seated emphasizes the soleus muscle, and the standing emphasizes the gastrocnemius (Which is the larger, two headed heart shaped muscle you see when you look at the calf). 

This paper that I found on Creatine levels and diet cites some studies that say creatine starts to degrade at 115 degrees in fish, and that baking meat causes 92% loss of available creatine due to actual breakdown and then other actions occurring because of that breakdown. (Note: While it is a research paper, most likely from a college student, it lists a lot of studies that it cites for information.) It states that to get the same creatine from cooked fish as you would from raw fish, you would need to eat 1.7 kg (3.74 lbs) of fish. Beef has even less available creatine. This is why everyone is telling you that dietary creatine is insignificant if you are wanting loading levels. You simply couldn't (ok, maybe you could) eat enough meat/fish for it to make the difference, and the other health effects from it would outweigh any benefits.
