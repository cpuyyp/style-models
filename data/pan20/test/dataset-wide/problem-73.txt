However, maintaining a gaseous core nuclear reactor may be compromised by the need for containment of the gaseous fission core. 

An Einstein-Rosen (E-R) bridge has been established that surrounds the solar system. Any spacecraft attempting to enter the solar system will pass over the E-R bridge will emerge somewhere else in the universe. 

Surprisingly enough, it's a real scientific technique. I know it does sound like technobabble, but it's for real. 

The time dilation in question is that experienced in the gravitational fields of inhabited planets. Note many of the other answers leapt to the erroneous conclusion that your question about time dilation related to relativistic space travel. It doesn't, so read the questions more carefully in future. The time dilation in the gravitational fields of inhabited planets with 9.8 m/s/s will be negligible. Exactly as it is here on good old planet Earth. It can be ignored for all everyday purposes. Now there may be time dilation to due to forms of space travel in your world, but that is an entirely different question. With a science-"magic" combination of FTL travel, it doesn't hurt to handwave away any unwanted relativistic effects like time dilation. 

This is a simple case of going about it the wrong way. What is the object of the exercise? It is this: "a group of different species has banded together to use this power to achieve Faster-than-Light technology (or as close as possible), which they haven't even come close to." The objective is to use the native's teleportation power to achieve faster-than-light travel. The group of different species decide to enslave the zappers (a good name, so it can used here too), but why? The zappers must be masters of escapology. Escaping by teleportation will be second nature to them. Enslaving them only works against their greatest strength. This is fools' errand, and it doesn't achieve the main objective of harnessing FTL travel. Remember "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar". Slavery is super-toxic vinegar. It won't work. The slugwits (my name for the group of different species) will do what any neo-colonial exploitative imperialists have done for time immemorial. They will cosy up with the zappers' ruling classes, offering them blandishments and whatever good stuff an interstellar travelling group like the slugwits to have give or sell. In turn, the zappers' rulers only have to allow access to a few members of the lower orders. Once this is done the specimens will be obeying the orders of their rulers and before they know is happening to them they will be anesthetized and taken to another planet (where teleporting won't help them) in the same planetary system for dissection, vivisection and other biomedical analysis. Admittedly the slugwits have to solve the same problem of thwarting the escape of zappers by teleportation, but instead of trying subdue many of them from escaping they only have to deal with a few zappers and this will be more tractable and easy to handle. The slavery option was plain dumb. There are always better and more sensible options. The slugwits were never going to be nice organisms. This way they're less messy and not so stupid. 

Absolutely not! if you built a smartphone with 1950s technology it would be the size of an aircraft hangar. You need the industrial infrastructure of the later 20th century and later to build a smartphone. It isn't remotely possible, take Newton's gold and run back to your time machine as fast as possible. Remember Sir Isaac Newton was in charge of the Royal Mint and was response for having counterfeiters tortured for their crimes. This answer supports the answer from @adaliabooks (who posted first and whose answer has more detail). So, remember to upvote his answer. 

No. They can't and they won't even try to do it. A planet's magnetic field is basically too feeble to even bother about turning their planet into tokamak reactor of any size. To quote this description of Magnetic Flux Compression Fusion, because this sets out the magnetic field strengths for a fusion reactor. "Magnetic fields above 10 mega Gauss can be reached compared with the Earth's magnetic field strength of 0.5 Gauss and refrigerator doors magnets of 10 Gauss." The difference between a fusion reactor's magnetic field and a planet's magnetic field is a factor of 20 million. Nice idea, but no banana. 

The conceptual problems with the Teleforce knock-off neutral beam weapon lie with a failure to understand the basic physics involved in making such a weapon. The proposed particles of "mercury-; nitrogen-; or iron nuclei" are all a poor choice. As nuclei they have too much mass to be readily stopped at the target and thereby transfer their kinetic energy to it. As recommended above, "A better choice of particles for the munitions feedstock for a neutral beam is hydrogen, it gives protons and electrons." In this configuration the neutral article beam consists of protons and electrons. The electrons, which are effectively beta radiation, will be stopped within a shallow distance of the surface of the target. Protection for beta radiation only needs to be the thickness of a brown paper bag. The protons having a thousand times the mass of the electrons will penetrate to depths of centimetres. Effectively the neutral particle beam has been separated into two charged particle beams. The electron beam which stops effectively at the surface of the target, and a proton beam which bores into the bulk matter of the target. Two factors will bring the proton beam to slow down and inflict more damage on the target. The matrix of charged matter within the target itself will exert a 'braking force'; this will transfer kinetic energy from the protons to the atoms of the target. Thus causing damage. The build-up of a negative charge on the surface of the target might act as an electrostatic decelerating force to slow down the protons. As they move more slowly they have a better chance of damaging the target. Though this effect may be discounted due to the dominance of electrostatic forces inside the target's bulk matter. Attempts to prevent the dispersion of a particle beam beyond the target will be futile. This is contrary to physics and a complete waste of time and effort. A mindless pursuit of the unattainable. The sensible approach is to design and produce a neutral particle beam weapon whereby the energy of the particles is brought to bear more effectively on and within the target itself. There will be inevitable losses of particles and their energy beyond and behind the target. Forget about that, preventing it is nonsense. Concentrate on delivering the maximum amount of particle beam energy to the target. 

This system sounds like a form of a resource allocation economy. It's similar to the sort of rationing that had been instituted in wartime except the level of resources are far greater. Wartime rationing was designed to provide equitable access to scarce resources. The querent's proposed system would be allocating not so scarce resources. Despite all the automation in running and maintaining this system somewhere along the line someone has to make the decisions about what algorithms are required to manage the resource allocation. While the majority of people will receive equal allocations, there will be some people who will need more resources than the average citizen. Now some of this enhanced allocation will arise from their occupations or their functional roles in society (this may be irrespective of their occupation). They could be this world's "rich". 

Source: Orphiocordyceps unilateralis Interestingly, and quite chillingly, this fungus is very specific about which species of ants it turns into zombies. The ant species it doesn't into zombies, simply die. Also, the fungus is able to produce specific chemical cocktails for controlling the brains of its ant hosts. These two concepts can be used as the basis of a more feasible Flood. The organism responsible could be a virus. It enters cells and takes over their metabolic machinery. By colonizing the neurological systems of sapient organisms they can create zombified hosts. Alternatively, the agent responsible for the Flood could be a highly evolved version of the zombie fungus. However, viruses can survive extreme conditions and especially the extreme conditions of space itself. In general terms, the virus and zombie fungus concepts provide a feasible biological basis for the Flood. This is still highly speculative biology, real biology itself provides analogues for the biological mechanisms necessary for such a parasitic superorganism. The next stage is to add pseudoscience to make it full workable (in theory, at least). This is a bit of mental "magic". Assuming the existence of telepathy, it is not entirely unreasonable to assume that a telepathic virus could develop. Once this telepathic virus infects the brains of preferrably sapient organisms, it can take command of its host's knowledge, skills and memories. It can alter and control its host's behaviour to firstly maximize infection of other host individuals, spreading the infection through populations of its current sapient host. By means of telepathy the growing infection can share the knowledge, skills, and memories it has acquired. This enables it to grow and develop a group mind making it a formidable adversary for its hosts. Infected hosts may behave in ways as if they continued to act in ways normal to their species. for example, infected humans would behave like normal humans except their behaviour would be modified to ensure the Flood's infection continued to spread until the entire human population was taken over. Presumably the same thing would happen with any sapient populations. This concept of a Flood-type of parasitic superorganism has been constructed by combining plausible biological models of viral and fungal mechanisms for usurping their hosts in favour of their parasitic organisms, and the pseudoscience of telepathy to enable the infection to develop a group mind. It has streamlined out the overly elaborate persiflage of the original Flood, but as science-fictional explanations go for an alien superorganism it is passable. 

Effectively this population of phenotypically identical emortals constitutes a population of unageing twins. Like twins their fingerprints and retinal patterns will not be identical. Therefore, persons can be registered by their fingerprints and/or their retinal patterns. The technology to read fingerprints and retinal patterns, especially if their application is required on the scale to identify persons within a sufficiently large population, is relatively trivial for a society with advanced enough technology to support an unageing population. 

The simple answer is not all. Understanding plate tectonics only came once the world had been thoroughly mapped by navigators, surveyors, oceanographers, cartographers, and geologists had followed up this mapping by conducting geological surveys. The essence of the theory of plate tectonics is the knowledge that continental drift takes place on a global scale. A seventh century world is unlikely to have the global knowledge of the planet they live on to comprehend the changes taking place over geological time. It wasn't until the early twentieth century that sufficient knowledge had been accumulated for a theory like plate tectonics to be postulated in the first instance. To people in the seventh century the world looks like a solid and immovable domain, even being able to grasp the concept that the earth beneath their feet is capable of moving and changing would have been beyond their grasp. This doesn't mean they were stupid, far from it as they are as smart as present day people, they simply didn't have a frame of reference or the knowledge to see the world was like that. 

Even Foxnews announced on 14 August 2010 that the Soviet Offensive was the key to the Japanese surrender was eclipsed by the A-bombs. 

Their argument can be simplified as follows: if the normal or ordinary laws of physics permit closed timelike curves (CTCs) then this should lead to physical events of a fairly exotic kind, ones we do not see in nature, and that the affect of the self-consistency principle is to ensure this new, exotic physics doesn't occur, and that the physics we see in time travel situations is the same physics we see in non-time-travel situations. They call this a no new physics condition. This is another one of those tautologies that plague time travel. Novikov self-consistency not only prevents the past from being changed, it also prevents the nature of physics itself being changed. End EDIT What follows for time travellers are the following implications (OK, this is also a tautology, but time travel logic is full of them.): 

Sometimes the simplest answer is best. It doesn't require future science and engineering to turn the tide of the Second World War. The Germans only need to be told their Enigma code was cracked by the Allies and they should add some extra rotors to their Enigma machines and improve their signalling procedures. 

You asked for catastrophic, you've got catastrophic! Assume a gas giant planet minding its own business is orbiting its primary star when two runaway neutron stars travelling in opposite directions make a 'synchronised' fly-by of the planet's equator. For convenience both neutron stars are of equal mass and moving through space at 30 km/s, which is a typical velocity for runaway neutron stars, relative to this planetary system. Their velocity vectors will match the direction of rotation of the gas giant planet. As both neutron stars pass by the gas giant planet enormous masses of its atmosphere will be gravitationally attracted to its nearest neutron star. Two huge plumes of atmosphere will be drawn out of the bulk of the gas giant. This will accelerate the atmospheric plumes and radically increasing their velocity. Provided both neutron stars perform their flyby at the correct distance away from the gas giant the velocity increase will not exceed the planet's orbital velocity. There will, of course, be a considerable amount of gravitational perturbation to the primary star and other planets in this system. In fact, the now spinning gas giant planet may be ejected from its planetary system. But the fact that the two neutron stars are approaching the planetary system from opposite directions may go some way to ameliorate the gravitational perturbation effects. There will be some who will argue that this is an exceedingly low probability. Quite correctly too, but this of itself does not make this scenario impossible especially if our universe is a Type 1 multiverse. A Type 1 multiverse is spatially and temporally infinite which means all possible configurations of matter and energy will occur and subsequently repeat themselves across this infinite manifold. So while spinning up a planet in this way is an exceedingly low probability event it will occur an infinite number of times in a Type 1 multiverse. 

A reading of the History SE answer about the Maritimes not joining the American Revolution cited above, suggests the following. 

A space sunshade in orbit around the red dwarf that periodically comes between the planet and its primary star. 

It would operate like super-megapolis, a gigantic hypertrophied city, with a population of one billion people. There would be additional technical services to cope with the rigours of deep space & orbiting a star. Expansion problems have already been solved (the OP says so). 

Rules of Engagement and the lessons of history. This is a post-nuclear war world. The soldiers are armed with deadly weapons. There is a global prohibition against civilian casualties and collateral damage. The mass destruction accompanying the nuclear war of five centuries has created an indelible lesson in the need to restrict combat and confine battlefields to much smaller areas. Fighting units are compelled by law and treaty to form up in small, compact groupings to make their exchange of fire less discriminate and less likely to harm civilians or destroy civilian property. Military personnel are also required by law and treaty to wear distinctive clothing to make them readily identifiable. Therefore, when the forces of the Midwestern Empire are abroad civilians will not wear red for their own safety and protection.
