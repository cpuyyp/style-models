The process was pretty gradual. For the WRNS, their association's website outlines it. Post-WWII, the service shrank to about 3,000 women in support and administrative jobs. Wrens had never been allowed to serve on board ships. In 1974, it was decided that integration had to happen, but this took decades: 

Another reason relates to WWI. The UK, France and Russia had all been badly damaged by that war, and here they were fighting another one in which Germany was the most dangerous opponent. The idea of doing it all over again in another few decades was deeply unattractive. Winning the war totally and remaking Germany so that it would no longer be aggressive offered the possibility of averting that. 

Quite a few. The term for people of partially Jewish descent in Nazi Germany was Mischling and Wikipedia has an article about them with a sampling of ones who were prominent, many of whom received the German Blood Certificate. The most notable example is Erhard Milch, a Luftwaffe Field Marshall. 

In 1748, the Virginia House of Burgesses and the King-in-Council set the meridian running North from the Fairfax Stone as the boundary between Virginia and Maryland. This was not surveyed and marked until 1788, when it was done by one Francis Deakins, commissioned to do so by the Maryland Assembly. Unfortunately, the "Deakins Line" is not straight, nor is it an accurate meridian. However, it became the accepted border between the states. There were lawsuits over this when the inaccuracy was discovered, which were eventually resolved by the US Supreme Court in 1910, in Maryland vs. West Virginia, by keeping the Deakins Line, since it had been the de facto border for a long time. Deakins does not appear to have been deliberately inaccurate, since his errors deprived Maryland, who were paying him, of territory that should have been theirs according to the original decisions. To find more about this, give your favourite search engine "Deakins Line", and expect to find a lot of articles about interesting local history. 

So he was claiming that his instructions to the German embassy in Mexico had been a contingency plan for use in case the US declared war, and was blaming President Wilson for a hasty and ill-considered breaking off of relations. I don't know if this had his desired effect within Germany, but it certainly increased the chances that the USA would go to war. That was disastrous for Germany; other not-so-great decisions by Zimmerman included helping to trigger the October Revolution in Russia. 

That seems to be a Harley Davidson biker's patch from a few decades ago, on sale as a collectable here. The Third Reich use of the Totenkopf symbol had a quite different design. 

Edit: Now, he may have been wrong about exact numbers, but this was the information available at the time. I believe some of the persons tried at Nuremberg tried to deny they had knowledge of the Holocaust, but the documentation undermined several of their cases. 

His USMC service was October 24th 1956 to September 11th, 1959. He was trained as a radar operator, and served in that role in Japan. The Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal required three consecutive years of good conduct at the time. He would not have had it: he did not serve for three years, and while he was quite bright and fairly capable, he wasn't good at long-term discipline, and was court-martialled twice, and punished on a third occasion. If he had any awards for personal bravery or achievement, they'd be in his biography, so we're left with campaign and qualification types of award. Going through the lists of US military awards for ones he might have been eligible for, I'm not finding anything: Current Awards 

"Affordable to the poor" is a slippery concept. However, books became much cheaper in the first half of the nineteenth century. Notable causes of this included steam-powered printing presses, mechanical typesetting, pulp paper mills, and the railway distribution network. These factors allowed the publication of cheap paperback books, which seem to have been invented by the Tauchnitz family in Germany, and followed up by publishers such as Routledge in the UK, aiming at the railway traveller market. 

I doubt anyone has compiled such a list. It wouldn't actually be terribly useful, as far as I can see. The difficulties start with a problem of definitions: are you asking for all the cities that contained targets for raids, or all the cities that actually received at least one bomb? With 1940s aerial navigation, the second list is likely to be rather longer than the first, because quite a few planes got lost. Switzerland was bombed several times, all of them by mistake. So the only sources that could list all the cities that were actually hit would be German, and many of them were lost during the war. There were also under- and over-reporting of raids by German sources during the war, for political and propaganda purposes. Then there's the definition of a city: the Ruhr area, which received many raids, has several legal cities, but some of them form a continuous urban area. There were also small urban areas that were sometimes targeted, and a thin random scattering of bombs jettisoned by damaged aircraft. Martin Middlebrook's The Bomber Command War Diaries: An Operational Reference Book, 1939-45, lists all the major raids by the British, but it's 808 pages. The US Army Air Force history is online, but lengthy. While the Soviets did not undertake a major strategic bombing campaign (here's an opinion as to why) they did undertake a fair number of small raids into Germany. 

There were clearly several raids, in addition to many patrols. Some of those raids may have had code names, but if so, they weren't significant enough to make it into theatre-level histories. My main source for all this is a compilation of Royal Marine unit histories, which makes it quite clear that there were no brigade-level operations after Operation Infatuate. I suspect that the online hints of a brigade-level operation may have arisen out of confusion between 4th Commando Brigade, and No. 4 Commando, a sub-unit of the brigade. That suggests that Bogart may have been a smaller-scale operation by No. 4 Commando on Schouwen-Duiveland. However, knowing that there wasn't a brigade operation answers my immediate questions. 

For a list of Royal Navy officers, you need to consult the Navy List. Many volumes of that are available on Archive.org; start with the latest one before 1936, and work backwards from there. It is also worth trying his name in Google without the R.N., and that will lead you to his full name. I haven't found much else, though. 

The Progressive Party of Canada is a small-scale exception. It was formed by farmers opposed to the then Conservative Canadian government's tariff policy, and tended to form alliances with the various Canadian Labour parties, or socialist groups. However, they did not last very long. 

The Despotate of the Morea, which was a province of the Byzantine Empire looks like one of these at first glance, but it isn't. The words "Despot", "Tyrant" and "Dictator" have all changed their meanings over time. 

Dummy anti-tank mines, consisting of ordinary china plates placed upside-down on a road were apparently used by a British Army unit during the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. This improvisation later featured in an SOE training course, and the British Military Training Pamphlet No.42. Like any anti-tank mine, you'd want to put them somewhere that tanks couldn't easily bypass them, and where infantry trying to remove them can be shot at from range.

I only know about this for the late eighteen and early nineteenth centuries, when a letter of marque would usually give you protection from ships belonging to the country that issued it. Usually, not guaranteed. It did no good at all with ships of the country or countries you were "entitled" to attack, who would treat you as a pirate. Other countries might do anything, and it was best to stay away from their ships. Edit: I have to admit my sources for this are tertiary, but the naval fiction of C S Forrester and Patrick O'Brien was very well-researched. 

WWII submarines making a journey of any length would run on diesels on the surface during the day, if there were reasonable odds of not being sighted. Rapid ("crash") diving was a very important tactic for them, and the ability to do it quickly was an important factor in both sub design and crew training. If they were travelling through a contested area they would dive during the day, but would usually proceed slowly on battery, because 12 hours at 2 knots is 24 nautical miles, and contested areas usually weren't huge. The battery capacity needed for underwater travel is large, so the "hotel load" for lighting wasn't a problem in underwater endurance without movement. In practice, they would usually keep moving slowly, because that means you're actually in control of the boat, which is largely exercised through the rudder and diving planes. The limit on underwater endurance was the breathability of the air in the boat, because they did not have CO2 scrubbers. It was normal, when it was expected that a submergence would be lengthy, to send most of the crew to bunks, to minimise their activity and thus their air consumption. The only way to refresh the air was to release compressed air from the air banks into the hull. This raised the pressure inside the sub, but this was usually limited to an extra half atmosphere or so, which wasn't a major problem provided you were careful when you first opened a hatch. Staying down for 24 hours would be unpleasant. 48 hours is probably about the limit. The exact figure depends on the size of the submarine, the number of people on board, the amount of activity, the amount of danger - adrenalin makes people breathe faster - the thoroughness with which the sub was ventilated before diving, and so on. Edit: If you aren't snorkelling, the depth you're at doesn't make much difference to submerged endurance. But read on for the small differences. "Maximum depth" for a submarine is a slightly complicated concept. There is "test depth", the depth the submarine is definitely capable of achieving without being damaged, and there is "crush depth" the depth at which the pressure hull collapses. Since that will depend on the weakest point in the hull, a submarine captain does not know what his exact crush depth is. He knows what safety factor the boat was designed for over its test depth, but he doesn't know if the hull has weak points. Assuming there are none would be unwise. At test depth, there will already be substantial creaking from the structure as it compresses under the sea pressure. Below test depth, the hull plates may well start to bulge inwards between the frames that support them, and there will likely be leaks. At some point, as you carry on going deeper, something breaks, and then the whole boat floods instantly. Even going to test depth causes metal fatigue, but this wasn't understood during WWII. When you're very deep, you want to move slowly. This is because of the possibility of failure of the depth plane controls. If you're deep, and moving fast, and depth plane control unexpectedly switches to "dive", you can easily put the bow of the boat below crush depth before you regain control. And if that happens, you die. So moving at great depth has to be done carefully. Going very deep to evade attack is thus dangerous, and will raise the stress levels of the crew and make them consume more air.
