A steady light is easier to judge distance by, so it's better to have the longer-distance light be the steady one. The more attention-grabbing flash is good to have on the wider angled light, so that you are more likely to catch the eye of drivers who are closer to you at an off-angle. Here's an image from the page showing one of the recommended configurations, with the Hotshot below on steady and the Solas above flashing. As an aside, I don't personally believe that laser lanes are effective at increasing safety. They seem like a real gimmick to me. Given the extra cost of the Sentinel taillight, you might be better off returning it (if you can) and just getting the regular Solas taillight, and then spending the money you saved on something different. 

I run The Bike Light Database (which started from a series of blog posts on this very Stack Exchange site). The Cygolite Hotshot and the NiteRider Solas are actually two of my top recommended lights, and I specifically recommend a setup similar to what you're describing. From the recommended taillights page: 

That is definitely the Vis 180 70 lumen. This is the new packaging that L&M just debuted in late 2014 when the 70 lumen model came out. They sent the new design to the packaging manufacturer just before they got the Vis 180 upgraded to run at 70 lumens, so the white insert says 50 lumens when in fact it's 70 lumens (as shown on the outside sticker there). Another way to double-check is the flash pattern. Does the pulse turn all the way off at its least-bright point or does it only go to about 20% dim? If it goes all the way off, it's the 50 lumen version, if it stays part-way on throughout the cycle, it's the 70 lumen version. You can see a video comparing the old and new flashes on the full Vis 180 review on the bike light testing site I run. To clarify on the packaging, all of their lights that are in a series come in the same packaging within that series. So if you buy an Urban 350, the inset has info about the whole Urban line, including the 350, 500, 650, and 800. When you bought the Vis 180, you got info about the Vis 180 and the Vis 180 micro, because they're sold in the same package with a different label on the outside. The Cygolite Hotshot puts out much less total light, but has a more focused, intense beam than the Vis 180. The total output of the Vis 180 is much higher. I personally use the Vis 180 as my primary taillight in steady mode, with a secondary (less bright) light in flashing mode. Your proposed setup could work well too. Having two lights is always a good idea! So, you almost certainly do have a legitimate Vis 180 2014 70 lumen version. One thing to be aware of is that the eBay seller is likely not an authorized reseller, so your warranty may be void: 

The Oregon Bicyclists Manual explains this very well, and with good diagrams, so I'm going to pretty much copy them verbatim here: 

There has been an ongoing debate in my area's local newspaper, regarding biking with vs. against the flow of traffic. A recent incident in which a cyclist was hit from behind, and later died of his injuries, prompted a letter in which another local called for cyclists to bike opposing traffic, so that they could more easily see oncoming traffic and avoid it if a crash was imminent. Experience, the law, and common sense all say that this is wrong — one would think that everyone knows you should ride with traffic because vehicular cycling is safer. That being said, the debate so far has been almost entirely focused on what the law says, and anecdotal evidence, which isn't enough to convince some people. Does anybody have any references to scientific studies showing actual data on the safety of riding with vs. against traffic? Explanations of why are welcome too, but please include some references or data. I'd like some sources that I can cite in a response showing that cycling with traffic is safer for everyone. 

Just the color. The products are identical. Light & Motion lists their different color variations as separate "products", probably due to some limitation of their store site engine. Note that there is an Urban 800 Fast Charge version, which in addition to coming in different colors, actually is a different product physically. 

They have more information specifically about buying from eBay here. I would suggest you inquire as to whether the seller is an authorized dealer – in my experience, L&M have excellent customer support, but you may be SOL if you bought from an unauthorized source. 

A couple weeks ago I rode around Crater Lake, a 35 mile ride with over 4500 feet of cumulative elevation gain – the sort of ride you really want functional gears for. The night before my rear derailleur cable snapped while I was biking home from work. I was able to make it to the bike shop with minutes to spare before they closed, and bought a replacement cable. Everything worked fine on the ride, but it got me to wondering what I could do if my cable had snapped a bit later and broken mid-ride. I'm not sure if this is universal, but on my bike and many I've seen, if the rear derailleur cable snaps, the rear gear will slip down to the smallest-diameter gear (i.e. the highest gear). This would make it almost impossible to climb significant hills and get home. Is there any simple fix one can do in the field with just basic tools that would enable you to get home on a broken derailleur, specifically when there are significant climbs that can only be done in a lower gear? Is there some way to force the derailleur to a certain position that you would find most useful, and keep it from slipping down from there? 

More importantly for your safety though, the color of a light conveys a certain meaning. Drivers, pedestrians, and other cyclists associate the color red with a taillight and the color white with a headlight. If you put the wrong color facing the wrong direction, people may think you are traveling the opposite direction. Imagine a car is pulling out of a driveway and sees a red bike light flashing to their left. They may assume that means a bike is moving away from them on the left. If they then pull out of the driveway and you're really moving towards them, you could get hit. 

Hard to tell from the photo whether a light or something else was mounted there in the past. It's certainly possible. There aren't any modern lights I'm aware of designed specifically to mount to the side of the fork like that. Many dynamo hub lights are designed to mount to the joint of the left/right sides (i.e. the crown) of the fork, but that type of mount wouldn't fit well on the side. It would be fairly easy to take a small piece of plastic or metal tubing and an appropriately sized screw, and create a small mount that a regular bike handlebar light mount could go on. For a step-by-step example, see this blog post. Below is a picture of their final setup: 

No. You should always ride with a white light facing forward and a red light facing backwards. If you want additional illumination, you can add multiple white/red lights in the appropriate direction. Amber/yellow lights can be used facing any direction for additional visibility. The first reason is that it's the law: 

Be seen lights can be rougly divided into two categories: focused and diffuse beams. Focused lights are much like to-see lights, they're just not actually bright enough to see with. They focus the light into a rougly circular shape that points mostly towards the front (or back) of the bike. Diffuse beams spread light much more evenly, and while they might have a hot spot, they're somewhat bright from every direction. I'm mostly going to address the latter, because focused be-seen lights should be treated effectively like see-with lights. Before we get to positioning, we need to think about flash pattern. Generally speaking, even your be-seen lights don't need to flash at night. Check out the answers on which is safer, lights that blink or emit a steady beam for the justification behind this. Essentially, if your be-seen lights are bright enough, they'll be noticeable at night without flashing. A strobing light can be very disorienting at night, and could ultimately reduce your overall safety. More manufacturers are starting to offer lights that pulse instead of strobing, which is an acceptable compromise at night – the changing brightness is more attention grabbing without being distracting like a strobe. If you have a steady-burn see-with light already, a pulsing be-seen light can be a useful addition. During the day, I would suggest using flashing lights. As the paper cited in the aforementioned flashing vs. steady post points out, the human eye perceives a flashing light as being brighter than a steady light with the same output. During the day your lights have a lot more to compete with because of the direct sunlight, so a flashing light helps you to be better seen. At the same time, it's not too distracting to drivers or other cyclists again because there's lots of other light. If you get into flashing lights that are above 500ish lumens, the flashing could still be distracting, but we're talking about be-seen lights here so that shouldn't be an issue. Now, positioning. On the front, if you have a focused beam, defer to the advice for see-with lights. If it's a diffuse beam and you follow the flashing advice above, it shouldn't matter a whole lot where you aim it because the light output should be fairly uniform. I would suggest mounting the light such that the illuminated surface is perpendicular to the ground. This will ensure that your light is seen from the greatest distance. For the rear, focused beams are sadly all too common. In order to be seen from a good distance, you should angle your light almost perfectly perpendicular to the ground, or tilted just a couple degrees down. What's most important is that you ensure the light isn't pointing too far up or too far down, else it won't actually be visible from a distance. Unless your light is both absurdly bright and very focused, you're unlikely to cause anybody serious discomfort (again, if following the flashing advice above). With a diffuse beam on the back, figure out which axis most of the light is spread across. Good diffuse lights will be designed such that the beam is very wide in one direction and narrow in another. Point your light at a wall to figure out which way is which, then mount it so that the wide axis and the spread of the beam is parallel to the ground, and center it so that an even amount of light comes out each side. This will ensure optimal off-axis and distance visibility. Again, following the flashing advice, you shouldn't have any significant issues with blinding people. 

Flashing yellow arrows have been introduced in the US recently to help ease congestion at intersections. This signal should be treated similar to a yield sign or a turn lane not controlled by its own traffic signal. If there is no oncoming traffic, you may make a left turn if it is safe to do so, but you must yield to any oncoming traffic and to any pedestrians in the crosswalk you would cross when turning. Although laws vary regionally with regards to how bicycles are treated in traffic, in most cases a cyclist would handle this situation the same as any other vehicle. If there is no oncoming, you can make a left turn, but be wary of traffic coming the other way. It may be safer to wait if you don't have a full view of oncoming lanes (i.e. if there is a blind corner or low visibility), since it will take you longer to clear the intersection than a motorized vehicle, and drivers coming the other way will not be expecting a bicycle in the intersection during their green light cycle. This animation from the Alaska DOT shows how the flashing yellow arrow sequence works: 

In your particular case, I would suggest method 2. Cross the intersection, then pull off to the side and orient yourself to cross with the crosswalk. Then wait until there's a break in traffic, and head across that way. If you eventually become more comfortable biking in traffic, you may choose to use method 1. I find that cars almost always slow down and let me in if I clearly signal that I'm making a left turn, but it depends on how fast traffic is, how confident of a cyclist you are, and what the road conditions are like. 

So, I've done a lot of (non-academic) research on bike lights for this site's community blog and more recently for the bike lights resource site I created, The Bike Light Database. There is a disappointing lack of hard scientific data on bike lighting at all, and essentially none regarding this specific question. I can tell you from extensive anecdotal experience that a flashing light definitely helps during the day, both forward-facing and rear-facing. A small AAA-powered blinky light won't do much for you, but if you have a high-output light on during the day, drivers give you much more respect. From the rear, they tend to slow down more and pass with a wider distance. On the front end, I'm much less likely to get cut off by drivers pulling out of driveways or side streets who think they have enough time to make it but don't quite. A flashing light is more useful during the day since there's so much more ambient light to compete with. The human eye responds to a flashing light more quickly than a solid light because it appears like movement. At night the flashing can be very distracting, but during the day there's not a high risk of disorienting drivers since again, there's so much ambient light. When Cygolite first released the lights with their Day Flash mode they told me that they had done some studies that led them to selecting a certain minimum brightness for their day flash. I'll email me contact over there and see if I can find out what sort of research they did and if they can share any of that with us. I also met a university researcher who's doing some studies regarding bike lights, although last I talked with him it sounds like it was still a work in progress. I'll see if he's doing any work with daytime lighting and if he can share any of that as well. 

I can't comment on whether using the same bolt is safe or not, but one possible workaround would be clip-on fenders. These just attach to the frame of the bike and don't need to be attached to the fork at all. They're not as sturdy/durable as fully installed fenders but will avoid any issues with a lack of mounting space on the fork. For example, Planet Bike sells some clip-on fenders for $20, and you could probably find them cheaper online or at your LBS. 

USB rechargeable lights are not typically designed to be run off of USB power continuously, they're only designed to be charged over USB. I run The Bike Light Database, and have tested dozens of different USB rechargeable lights. A few models will run while plugged in, but typically do not charge if turned on, and only run at the lowest output setting. If you're already going to be getting a DC-DC converter, you would be better off getting a headlight that runs directly off of DC power. It'll be cheaper than getting a battery-powered light which you don't intend to use the battery of, and probably more reliable. There are hundreds of options for super cheap (both in cost and quality) bike headlights which run on 8.4 V. You can probably find one without a battery pack, or if you do buy one with a battery pack make sure to recycle the batteries because they tend to be unsafe and low quality. You could also look into higher quality lights which use an external power source; many different manufacturers sell them and they pretty much all take a 2.5x5mm DC barrel plug at a nominal 8.4 V. The Fenix BT20 is a good example of one such light. Cheap generic Cree U2 light (left), Fenix BT20 (right) It's going to be harder with taillights. I don't know of any taillights which operate when plugged in to USB, and I also don't know of any affordable taillights designed to run off of an external power supply. Your best bet might be to look for a taillight meant for vehicle usage and get a DC-DC converter which will put out 12 V. Trailer lights can be gotten for cheap online, or if you wanted something more visibility-oriented you could get a light like the type found on tow trucks and emergency vehicles. I did that using a 12V battery pack and a TIR3 light I got online and wired up:
