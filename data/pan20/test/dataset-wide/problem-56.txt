A purely theoretical answer for completeness' sake. Around the equator, the snow line is around 4500m above sea level (source: $URL$ Research has shown that a slope of 30° is a likely upper bound for a stable mountainside; higher angles will result in more landslide erosion until the hillside stabilizes (sources: $URL$ - paywalled with excerpt; $URL$ - references first source) A 30° angle means a slope rises 1m horizontally per 1.173m traveled vertically. So 4500m up requires 5278.5m sideways. Leading us to an ideal, minimal island size of a 30° cone, 4500m high with a radius (ie. distance from peak to beach, as the crow flies) of 5km and a quarter. 

Nuclear power stations will have their chain reactions shut down: $URL$ However, there is a serious problem remaining, namely decay heat ($URL$ Quotes from that article: 

In order to effectively transmit information and prevent data loss, interference must be kept to a minimum. In other words, all other sources of gravitational waves must be either disabled or perfectly predictable. Since the first option seems unfeasible, we must use the second. Now, this does lead to one requirement: at least one side of the communication must know exactly what effects existing gravitational waves will have on the communication, based on the precise location of the other side. Either the receiver must be able to subtract the interference from the signal they received to arrive at the message, or the sender must pre-subtract the interference from their signal so that it arrives at the sender as a message. So while this can be done for point-to-point communication, I do not believe it feasible for broadcasting. 

I would use a few non-magical alchemists and have them create poisonous gas, then use my mages' ability to control the winds to ensure the gas goes towards my enemies' army and doesn't disperse too much. Should be a total massacre. The benefit here is that depending on the natural wind condition, you need less and less magic the more the wind is already in your favor. Note that this is of course a large-scale tactic that takes a bit of time and doesn't really answer what a mage would do in case of immediate danger. 

The nature of the directed gate makes sending humans prohibitively expensive If sending one human represents 99% of the cost of the entire mission, then sending two would double the already immense cost. Presume, for example, that because of some relativistic rules of physics, a directed gate actually makes 1000 years of time pass for the objects transported (an issue that the tethered and captured gates manage to bypass). Now, anything purely technological could be sent with a minimal battery and get through without much issue. But right now IRL, we have barely begun to scratch the surface of cryogenically storing humans for the long term. What if it needs constant monitoring? What if the environment you spend 1000 years in isn't perfectly heat-neutral? What if a human body still needs some nutrients on a regular basis? Any or all of these circumstances could lead to the pricetag of a single human becoming such that the risk of losing the one becomes the preferred alternative over spending twice the money (and maybe losing both anyway...) Note that this option would also require that the chance of succeeding without a human needs to be as close to 0 as possible. 

$URL$ In the Wheel of Time series of fantasy novels, the nation of Seanchan has basically achieved this through the use of magical items that can be used to directly enslave mages. The working of the item, in this case a collar, is never truly explained as far as I know, nor how they are made. Only the effects are given: 

(References have been removed from the quoted texts.) In short, the reactors will shut down, but if there's no-one left to keep the cooling going properly for long enough, then it's quite likely there will be some serious accidents. So there's a very good chance that large-scale power generation will be shut down rather quickly, within a few days or weeks. Not necessarily broken and unrepairable, though. 

North Korea Don't settle in the US, settle in the most totalitarian corner of the globe. While I'm pretty sure that North Korean people would notice that many people missing, what exactly are they going to do about it? Who can they complain to, who can they ask questions of? If the aliens control the government, any indication that you think something's wrong will just get you shipped off to the farm as well. The same total lack of free communications will also mean that a lot of the defectors out of North Korea would simply not be aware of the problem, and those that do might not initially be believed. And even if the rest of the world starts suspecting there's something quite wrong, what can they really do? Maaaaaybe they can get some spies there and find out the truth, but in the current state of nuclear affairs, an invasion is out of the question. 

Start with numerical scores If you're capable of colonization, why not abstract the difficulty of colonizing it into a numerical score? E=mc² so energy is mass. You're going to need some of both to effectively colonize, but for mere abstract purposes you can reduce your shopping list to either one. Then all you need is to pick a suitably large unit value and you can easily rank colonizable planets. This nearby planet that's a lot like your home? That's a 5. Terajoules? Exagrams? Doesn't really matter. That icy rock floating lightcenturies away? 500. Everything is taken into account to reach your score. Energy in order to get there, energy to warm it up if it's too cold, mass if you need to import food, less mass if you can grow food but need to import soil, etc. The point is, there are so many factors that abstracting it all is the only way to reach a simple system. And unless you're the guy packing the colonization ship, do you really care if you need those 5 terajoules of energy just to get there, or if you need them to heat up the planet? No, you just need to find those joules. Maybe you have fusion engines and those joules are better stored as mass, but again, that's a practical concern. Some additional notes: 

It's not on the same scale, but here is an article from Nature that talks about a spider attracting moths by mimicking their sex pheromones: $URL$ Some quotes: 

Gut reaction: no, aliens cannot become part of human culture. However, it would be possible for both cultures to merge into one shared culture. This would require time (many generations), during which there will be opponents on both sides trying to stop the process or derail it. If it does succeed, the culture will probably be 1/3rd originally human, 1/3rd originally alien and 1/3rd completely new stuff that grew out of the cross-pollination of cultures. 

I'm not exactly sure if there's snow all year round on it, but there was a pretty nice layer on it when I was there (december 2016). Of course it's an active volcano so there are no ski slopes. (Quotes from Wikipedia) 

One of the lowest levels determining sex we've found so far is the $URL$ This gene is responsible for starting the differentiation of male sex organs, from a common base. So anything that can affect this gene, or the structures that this gene is usually contained in (the whole Y chromosome) should do the trick. One thing that might influence your choice is whether you want all babies to be born female, or whether you want male babies to be stillborn, ie. does your population initially keep growing at the same rate or at half rate. 

Reception - Global broadcast As other answers have pointed out, one important hurdle you need to scale is that data needs to get to your phone. Current implementations require your phone to let nearby towers know it's there, so that data can get routed to your phone efficiently. However, this is not necessary. You can do broadcasting, ie. sending the data to every single phone in the entire world. If the data is properly encrypted, only yours will be able to understand it. This already exists for SMS: $URL$ Note that this would only be feasible for a small number of phones, since otherwise you would quickly saturate the entire network, but you did say it was for a few key people. Note that you really, really need to have rock-solid encryption, because every single hacker in the world will also receive the data. And finally, note that yes, you will need to get other companies to accept this broadcast traffic. You can probably get away with an excuse along the lines of: "let's implement this in case of global emergency, we keep the keys so no-one can use this without permission". Sending - no real solution So you can receive data, but sending is another problem. Your phone will always be the single source of the transmission. Now transmissions like these always hop over a number of stations. The best way to go is to ensure you reach a station you control ASAP. Once there you can totally cover your tracks. This means no-one can work their way back to your phone from any station between yours and the final destination. They could find your phone if they start somewhere between your phone and your station, but they'd have to know where to start looking. 

Somewhat side-stepping the question: if science manages to make enough advances to create the geneseed, I would fully expect they will be able to improve on the current in-vitro fertilization and/or cloning technologies. Right now, we're already at a stage where the only thing really needed for a new human child is a womb for roughly 7 months. The "mother" doesn't need to be biologically related, the father doesn't need to serve any purpose beyond providing genetic material. As soon as they're born, they can be kept by the government. No parental strings need to become attached whatsoever. So if science can develop artificial wombs, well then there is no more need for anything resembling parents. And if there's no parents involved, then honestly, you'll have some resistance on principle, but compared to the threat to humanity, it'll be small. You can also counter some of that opposition by harvesting genetic material from everyone. Everyone will have donated something to the cause, everyone will have a child (whom they never met or even knew existed) serve in the war. Let the standard human herd mentality do the rest. The only downside is, if the geneseed is an unexpected discovery, then you need 10 years before you have your first soldier, since you can't start producing children like this in advance. If it's a long-term scientific work, then you can work out a schedule in advance. It'll still take a few years to truly ramp up, though. 

So to a large degree, it's very much a Handwave, as in, it just works. But it could be useful inspiration. 

Radar invisibility that can be turned on and off You've raised a good point: our airspace is currently monitored permanently by radar. Any unplanned disappearance below or above radar level, is very likely to be detected and will raise serious questions. The only solution to that is to be invisible to radar, but that also means you can never officially land on any airstrip that is managed by air-traffic control, because that would draw attention and questions. Your question says they want to be able to land at various airstrips, so they must be able to be visible on radar when they want, and invisible when they don't want. You must of course be extremely careful when going from one mode to another. From visible to invisible, you need to give air-traffic control a good reason why you're going below (landing somewhere?). The other way, again, you need to be below the radar when switching. 

Metal fibres A fabric is something woven or knitted out of fibres. We as humans prefer fibres from animal or vegetal sources for various reasons, but mineral (like Werff proposed) or metal fibers can be made into a fabric just as easily. To some degree, you could say that chainmail is already a fabric made of metal. 

Would we be able to establish communication? That depends on whether or not your Stone Age adult knows language. Scholars seem to agree that language developped some time during the Stone Age ($URL$ but that covers 3.4 million years and several different species of the genus Homo. So you'd need to specify that a bit more. If this person has language abilities, then we can probably establish communication and begin to teach this person, just like we teach children. The actual result is hard to predict, since it would depend on the individual and her ability to learn and adapt. Becoming a normal member of society would probably be out of the question, especially since she would probably be world famous. 

I believe your analogy is flawed. The situation these aliens would find them in is not akin to us humans being in the dark, it's more like us humans in an overly bright situation. What do we do when there's too much light? When there's too much noise? We artificially dampen our senses. We hold our hand over our eyes to reduce incoming sunlight, we wear sunglasses, we carry around parasols, we wear ear protection, ... These aliens would need to develop a similar tool, to avoid their senses being overwhelmed. What form that could take is hard to say, since it very much depends on the details of their senses. For example, they might carry around something highly predictable to them, like maybe a music player, whose music they already know by heart. They could focus on that bit of 100% guaranteed future and try to ignore the rest. But this only works if they do not see the possible futures as indivisible wholes. So that's up to you to decide if it would work or not.
