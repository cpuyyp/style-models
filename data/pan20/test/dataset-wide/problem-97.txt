The issue isn't crushing or "infinite in theory". The practical issue is the limit set by random effects, variations in book positioning (if "sloppy"), and most of all irregularities in books themselves. A pile is stable so long as its centre of gravity (CoG) is over the start of the pile and dynamic effects of oscillations/vibrations, wind, human touch etc don't cause its CoG to not be over the centre (of momentum to build up etc). The taller it is, the more all those can play a role. Book sides aren't exactly parallel; books act like elastic springs when other books in the pile move, wind and touch increasingly cause instability. Above all, when the pile oscillates, the higher up books move sideways as a unit much more (and elastic/dynamic effects become more pronounced which amplifies any existing/initial oscillation), and it also only needs an increasingly small maximum tilt during an oscillation to reach tipping point. I don't have an answer but that's what will limit it, however careful your hero is. 

Part of the problem is that infinities are somewhat counterintuitive. The infinite hotel is a classic example. (*) You want an infinite being that doesn't take up everywhere and lets people wander round, and doesn't get too thin? Nothing could be simpler! Your being is a conical being, which slithers along the ground, and is obligingly flexible so it can slither over other infinite beings. Its head is at the bluntly rounded apex of the cone, and cones of course have infinite volume, if they aren't truncated. There is no "thin" point, and it takes up an infinitesimal part of the world. (* a hotel has an infinite number of rooms, and is 100% booked. If one guest turns up, move everyone into the next higher room, and the new guest can stay in room 1. If a (countable) infinite number of guests turn up, move every guest into a room of double their present room number, which frees an infinity of odd numbered rooms for all the new guests. If an uncountable number of guests turn up, buy stocks in Cantor's AirBNB business and quit the hotel world!) 

Like @Schwern said, idioms are not literals. I'll try to answer this a few ways, but they all come down to much the same point. You might find the paper useful/fascinating, titled "What is it like to be a bat?", which covers this ground. Quick outline: The author asks from a philosophy viewpoint, what it's like to be a (speculatively blind) bat who uses sound "chirps" instead of vision. The author concludes roughly, that the bat would probably think of it as we do sight, by what it provides rather than by how it happens (do we think of photons when we see?). In the same way, your inner living people will have a term (several terms?) meaning "this land/place/surface we live in/on", and whatever term they use, which might be Nordic, or a completely original word, would be used much as we use "earth". The fact we use "earth" as an expletive doesn't relate to "earth as round planet in space", it relates to "earth as known land people can live on/are aware of". "Earth" itself doesn't (or didn't until recently) mean "planet in space" either. So you need to decouple meanings here. When we say "what on earth" we aren't using a term that is based upon knowledge of a round planet whose exterior we live on, or anything like it. We are using "what on earth" to signify "what is this, which seems so unlikely that it should not exist on the places we know and are aware of, and live in" (or something along those lines). So coming back to your question, they may have a similar expletive referencing their term for "all known places", they may not have expletives at all, or they may have a term for it that isn't itself meaningful otherwise such as "what in zlobbbttki" or whatever, a symbol they use for "all the universe except for the bits the gods watch TV in", or whatever outlandish terms cultures has led to. Terry Pratchett would have been more imaginative, I think. The upshot is, don't assume/expect a direct parallel and if one did exist then the word could be anything people might come to use after centuries of linguistic isolation. 

You might consider a combination of broadcast (as used by "the internet of things") & solar power, besides that, with as many robots propping up the economy & industry before the fall (as you say) it may not be (too) far fetched to say the power industry was fully automated, so they could all just be plugging themselves in at night all over the country to recharge like good little domestic appliances. Other good power sources for you include thermoelectric (also called Seebeck) generators & types of broadcast power "tuned" to generate power from background radiation or else from infrared light, no transmitting station is needed for any of those & they never run out, though your bots may have long periods of downtime while they recharge with these ones. 

If you want to get silly you could even have your bots powered (indirectly) by ethanol & bio-diesel, a whole automated farming & industry chain producing crops, processing them into fuel & delivering it to the power stations, with the power flowing back to the abandoned cities & homes the bots inhabit through the remnants of the bot maintained national grid, where they plug in to recharge. 

So other than walking on the soles of the feet (plantigrade), humanoid & clutch size, an Ostrich. Other than hole nesting (which as you point out has implications for the egg not rolling away & the necessity (or rather the lack of any) of shapes that avoid that) your criteria have no implications for egg shape (well not much worth speaking of). Typical clutch size can have some implications for the potential size of individual eggs, but not really for shape (if you only lay one egg you can put more resources in it). It's not one of your criteria but the size of the birth canal (or whatever we call the bit an egg passes through) does have implications, you're laying one egg at a time so you'll want to put as much into that one egg as you can to allow for larger better developed offspring with the best chance of survival at hatching & an oval shape will allow a bigger egg to pass through the pelvic bones. Other than that it will conform to the rounded oval structure of most eggs (simply because a sphere provides the most strength for the shell, & an oval is the closest you can get to that while allowing it to be longer than it's wide so you can have a bigger egg for the size of the pelvis). The same as many other eggs it might be a little thinner at one end so it will roll in a circle instead of rolling away (just in case it is ever out of the nest hole). The long & the short is that nature has had a long time to perfect the design & barring a very few outlying examples has chosen much the same design for almost every egg laying species eggs.. So it will be (really big surprise) egg shaped, meaning a slightly asymmetrical oval. 

All the resources, all the materials, everything you need to build a space station in the first place are basically at the bottom of a gravity well (i.e. on planets). Was that "asteroid belt" I heard you say? it's a damn long way out from the sun to that, & energy to run your station out there is going to be thin on the ground as a result, travelling out & back with the ore will take a damn long time & likely even more energy than lifting the stuff off planet. So everything you need to build, extend & maintain it has to be hauled uphill (or a very long way). In the short term there may be advantages to a space station but ultimately in the long term the cost benefits of hauling all that stuff off world every-time you have enough population increase to need to expand (or build a new station) means that long term the planet route will win every time. Whatever advantage space stations do or don't have long term it's just cheaper & more economic to drop your population at the bottom of that hill where everything they need (for expansion) is anyway. Which doesn't mean we shouldn't have space stations, we should, there are a lot of things we can do with them we can't do (or can't do as easily, or as well) on a planet & they're going to be a useful part of our toolkit, but as a housing solution for the bulk of the human race they're a non-starter. All in all even an un-terraformed planet where you have to live in a contained environment is a better solution for a growing population than a space station, at least everything needed to build new living space is close at hand there. 

So that sets a precedent for "one or at most very few places" and some ideas for features as well. If your product needs specific features to come about, those might only have existed in one place together. How else could it happen? Statistically, although any ore is distributed, the concentration will vary. So you can require a specific concentration range to have existed, and that affects rarity. The geological origin will also matter - did it need to have come from an ore that's had certain history, for example produced from sand that became compressed and then exposed to great heat or pressure? Now you need a location where sand was created at the surface and pulled down at a tectonic plate edge. Again, the specificity can make it rare. An example: Suppose it needed calcium carbonate from sea animals, with a high proportion of something or other that evolved in a given species. Imagine a species in ancient times had a biology that metabolised and concentrated mercury, and arose in an isolated landlocked sea where it proliferated for a few hundred million years until the sea dried and all such animals became extinct. You now have a thick bed of calcium carbonate and some organic mercury compounds at high levels. Add a few billion years and some handwaved geological circumstances that transformed the newly formed rock to a new form over time, and you have an answer. If you also add heat + pressure, then even if this biology were in multiple locations, the resulting ore might have formed from the sediment deposits in one area only. 

Theocracy makes sense if something is to be gained by it. Quite possibly nothing will be - in that case it won't have a compelling reason to be the form of government. Example - perhaps humans figure out that actually, (a) gods exist but (b) they don't seem to want or seek anything from humans, or offer anything to them. Urban foxes know cars exist, we know volcanoes exist - the presence of forces beyond our own, doesn't seem to automatically command a religious approach to them. (While we did worship volcanoes, its worth noting this was at best, only when we assumed it would achieve something, or when there wasn't a better object of praise around the diesphere...) Gods may also have agendas far different from humans', so that what they do and care about is completely lacking in human relevance in most cases. Perhaps all one needs to know of the gods is how to recognise when a divinely initiated event is likely to happen so as to not be in the vicinity (think tornado warnings - "yesterday Odin turned the sea blue near the city, residents advised to leave for the hills for a week in case of some untoward event') 

It may not have any extra strength (etc) at all, because the strength (or other abilities) are not directly or even necessarily related to the ability to metabolise energy or abundance of energy. The main reason is that most limits are not energy related. If you had infinite energy on tap immediately, your muscles would not automatically be stronger muscles, have a higher breaking strain for muscle fibres, be more efficient at conveying that energy to the muscles or removing excess heat or waste products (lactic acid etc) from them. It wouldn't necessarily make you any more intelligent or more co-ordinated, so even if your body could move faster or better (how?) you might not have the enhanced body-eye coordination or reaction speed required to do wonders with it. In effect the question can be paraphrased a bit like this - if you could direct any amount of glycogen/ATP/whatever around your body at will, would you expect this to make you a superhuman? Probably not. Energy sounds great but its not the major limiting factor to performance. 

Over the generations, this sort of phobia – where the crew is concerned with even being close to a gravity well – would turn into almost a religion. An ark ship travelling for generations could develop its own lore, traditions, and faith... meaning that arriving at the planet would be Armageddon, and the colonists would be the anti-christ(s). The (prophesied?) Captain, in turn, would be a sort of Messiah, or, at the least, the Pope. The colonists, then, must break this unified front into smaller groups. Fanatics are obsessed with purity. It's not enough to know who is opposed to gravity – everyone is – you need to know how tainted people are by gravity. How many people have passed through the parts of the ship that were able simulate gravity? Whose ancestors used those gravity simulators? Whose ancestors boarded the ship last (and were in a gravity well longer than others)? Alternatively, genetic enhancements probably were unevenly expressed – so who shows signs of muscle loss, weak bones, etc? Purity becomes paramount, hereditary even, and potential traitors are everywhere. The colonists can play on these tendencies. First, they should broadcast a series of pleas from families desperate for supplies – begging, please won't you send us the food/medicine/technology we need to live? Make the stories as sob inducing as possible – really ham it up. Next, broadcast a message (ostensibly addressed to the captain) saying: 

I see an interesting way of dealing with this (other than the excellent answers so far!). If the supply ships arrive all at once it would change the answer a bit, but it seems like the question asker and many answers here assume that it's not a simultaneous thing. The OP states: 

If enough supplies are sent, they can stiff the crew and just let them die in orbit. If those supplies aren't enough... well, more strife, as they say, must be stirred: 

Some great answers here – want to briefly add my two cents. The TLDR version is: make contraception the norm (free IUDs for anyone who wants them!), give women full rights over their bodies, and create a more egalitarian society where anyone can have long, successful careers in fields that interest them. It does depend on how you define 'manageable population growth,' but below are some knobs you might be able to turn without getting dystopian. Having children is both expensive and dangerous. In fact, pregnancy has always been a leading cause of death for women, especially in poor countries. Combined with the fact that infant mortality has drastically declined with advances in medicine, having a baby in well off countries has become something people do less often simply because they don't need to have 12 kids just to make sure some survive until adulthood. Moreover, with ubiquitous contraception and control over their bodies, women have more choice in when and how often they have children. In most countries these days, this leads to lower birthrates naturally. And it makes sense: if you could make an expensive, large commitment with a (relatively) high risk of death anytime in your life, would it be the first thing did? Or would you get some lower risk, lower commitment things out of the way first? Given the profound nature of bringing life into the world, and having another being completely dependent on you, wouldn't you want to take the time to make sure you're ready and able to do it right? Would you want to take this risk often, or only once or twice? As of 2015, the US birthrate has dropped to the lowest levels in decades, well below 'replacement.' With more access to the things that make that possible, I don't see any reason the downward trend wouldn't continue. Having babies is hard, but in the past, NOT having babies was even harder. Make it easy to not have babies and you're probably most of the way there (again, subject to your definition of 'manageable population growth').
