I don't know of a source for Europe, but The American Alpine Club published "Accidents in North American Mountaineering" annually. 

Yes. There's nothing wrong with melting snow and then purifying it with a standard water filter. Most of the water in mountain streams was snow at some point anyways. That being said, this is generally going to be a very inefficient way to make water, and if the temperature is below (or really anywhere near) freezing, you're going to be thirsty. I would strongly recommend carrying a stove instead. Bringing water to a rolling boil kills almost all pathogens. It doesn't remove particulate matter, but clean snow generally won't have many particulates anyways. A small stove like the MSR Pocket Rocket I have weights much less than a good water filter. Not only does it allow you to melt snow, it also allows you to get a warm drink if you need it, and you can purify regular water by boiling it too. 

Candela is the unit for a point measurement which doesn't depend on the distance. Candelas are inversely proportional to the square of lux. You can convert lux to candela using the inverse square law: where d is the distance in meters from the light source. 

Lower leg splint Splinting a lower leg fracture requires very similar supplies to an arm splint, with slight variations. The same principles of applying TIL and treating any soft tissue injuries apply. Rather than a smaller rigid material like a SAM splint, you can use a standard sleeping pad. In my opinion, the leg splint is a bit easier than the arm splint, but it's harder to explain with words – see the photo below for step-by-step pictures, from this nice article from the wilderness medicine newsletter. You will need: 

Why should you care so much about your aerobic fitness? because the body can only store about 2500 calories in glycogen, the fuel used to generate power anaerobically as apposed to around about 100,000 calories in fat, which will be used to generate power aerobically. As alpine climbing is an endurance activity lasting sometimes several days you can see that dipping into your glycogen supply is a luxury that should be reserved for difficult crux moves or unexpected emergencies, not to compensate for a lack of aerobic fitness on the approach. The most effective training will likely be quite boring unless you have access to some really nice country side. Walking with a weighted pack up something, local steep hill, stair master, staircase of multi-story building. Put something like water or rocks in your bag that you can dump out at the top to save your knees on the descent. I'd avoid running with weight for the same reason. Improving aerobic fitness is quite a large topic but the consensus is low intensity high volume. Adequate recovery is as important as the workout. 

As most people have recommended Training for the new alpinism is a very comprehensive sports science book on exactly the subject your interested in. It covers much more than a stackexchange answer could expect to. From said book, 

Does a tent need any special care after camping on or near ocean beaches? I know that salt can corrode metal (e.g. metal in the poles, stakes, zippers, etc.) and sand can mechanically abrade many parts of a tent. I don't know to what extent occasional use in those conditions will affect the longevity of a tent though. Do I need to rinse everything out when I get done with such a trip, or is simply drying and brushing out the tent as usual sufficient to protect it from wearing out? Is there some other maintenance I should be considering following use in these conditions? 

As Russell mentions, flagging tape can work well in this situation. I carry a roll in my first aid/survival kit, as it's also useful for marking your path if you're lost, among other uses. A more permanent and reflective alternative would be to get some type of reflective fabric and attach it to your fly. You could potentially sew it on, if you're not too concerned about water ingress, or you could just sort of drape it over the fly. 3M makes a reflective non-stretchy fabric which you can buy on Amazon: 

Assuming you are in a location where the signal can be picked up by a satellite – which they almost always can be – the AFRCC will receive your call almost immediately. Most PLBs these days are GPS-integrated. 

Aglets, shoelaces being easy to find and in the right lengths, the smooth exterior and if you have the right kind, the ease of tying and staying in their knots. As a hobby knot tyer, (and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers) I use mountain boot laces to try out the knots I am working with, rather than paracord. On the other hand, I know enough people who make their own laces out of cord of the right size and with a smooth enough surface for the shoes they are used in. Reasons to make their own: Longer lasting laces. Needing non standard lengths. Needing non standard diameter laces. Needing two different lengths due to having an insole or two very different feet. Wanting a colour or design which is not available in their (local) shops. As long as the ends are finished in a way that works, they are happy with their laces, often so happy that they never go back to shop bought ones. While I do agree with using other readily available string and might do it one time, I do not think braiding your own is useful. See my answer here on Arts and Crafts Stack Exchange. One 'knot' that is very useful for making (temporary) shoe laces out of other string is the whipping to finish the ends. Here the Common Whipping on the animated knots site (others are available.) (The site I linked to in the first word of this answer is that of Ian Fieggen, who has a great site about shoe laces, their knots and whatever else you may need to know about them.) 

So far I've far avoided needing to make such a repair but most of the repairs I've seen in the wild have either been gaffer tape or a patch of fabric stuck on with seam sealant. Sometimes if its a small hole just pinching it together and covering with seam sealant. Six Moon Designs has a useful guide for which sealants are best for which materials and a recipe to make your own. I'll summarize below encase the link becomes dead. silnylon use McNett's SilNet Polyester Fabric use McNett's Seam Grip or McNett's Seam Sure Cuben Fiber use McNett's SilNet or McNett's Seam Grip DIY seam sealant 

This will a bit of a more general answer because I don't run 10k but... Peak fitness is something you aim to hit at a certain point in time and is not something that can be maintained for a great period of time. Expecting to perform your best every time will likely lead you to be disappointed. That's not to say you're not capable of running 10k faster than your current best every day, just not yet. 

I think It would be as possible as belaying one leader using double ropes. You would need to take in slack at different rates, as apposed to give it out and prepare to hold a fall with either rope. (in case it isn't obvious) You would belay from your rope loop/belay loop instead of off the anchor as there is no 'guide mode'. Where you would run into trouble would not being able to take in slack for one second while holding the fall of the other. For this reason I would avoid doing so. One alternative is for the first second to trail a rope and instead of cleaning the route unclipping to pass protection, then clipping the trailing rope back in for the second-second(third?) to clean/be protected. 

I think you have the right idea. Leave No Trace principles (and wilderness permit regulations in many areas) dictate that washing be done at least 100 feet from camp, trail, or stream. If there's some soil nearby that would be the best spot, because there'll be higher activity from decomposing organisms there which will break down any tiny bits of food you may wash out. Avoid impermeable surfaces like granite slabs, because your rinse water will run off and end up contaminating a much larger surface area than if it can percolate down into a permeable material. As you mention, large, clean, flat rocks nearby can make organization easier, but I would try to avoid accumulating food particles in the open to get "munched up". Too much food accumulated in one place is more likely to attract animals than a bunch of small particles dispersed in the soil, and you don't want to attract animals to your camp. 

I think you already answered your own question. Most dedicated GPS devices are more rugged, have better battery life, and don't require a data connection to work well. A phone has a lot of power overhead and is fragile. There are a few possible advantages to a phone. If you're already going to be carrying one, it reduces the total weight required. It's often easier to update data on a phone than on a GPS device. On the other hand, there aren't in my experience very many good apps for phones which have full-featured GPS capabilities without a data connection. Most of the GPS type apps I've tried I've been unimpressed with, and would've preferred a dedicated GPS device. 

This isn't really a clear yes/no sort of question, I'm also pretty reticent to tell someone what would be best for their child. Aside from that hopefully someone will provide some information that will make your decision or others thinking of doing the same easier. My first suggestion would be to work out which huts you are thinking of staying at or around and ring the guardians who are usually very helpful/knowledgeable! I don't know how much you know about huts in the alps but some things to consider; 

Just face the pointy bits towards each other and wrap the webbing around the bundle to keep them together. I then just chuck them in the bottom of my bag if I know I don't need them or in the top if I know I will. You could pad them with a hat, spare socks or what ever if you were worried about other more delicate items. Also even if they start out sharp once they've encountered a small amount of scrambling or walking up some moraine they're unlikely to be sharp enough to damage something unless you're being very forceful in your packing / unpacking.

Basically, you should look at the 10 essentials, and make sure you have those and some additional gear any time you go out. Now supposing you're actually well prepared as outlined above, your priorities are going to depend on the climate. In any emergency situation, your first priority should be to treat immediately life-threatening injuries – severe bleeding, etc. Anything that won't kill you in the next hour should wait. Then, sit down, eat a good snack, drink water, and take a rest. It's important to be rested, fed, and mentally prepared to tackle the situation. It's easy to freak out in an emergency, so it's crucial that you force yourself to physically sit down and take care of your most basic needs before proceeding. Hopefully you have enough food, water, and clothing that you can then focus on treating any injuries enough to enable you to walk for help. If you need to spend the night, look for a sheltered spot before it gets dark. You may need some water to clean the wound, so you should be looking for some additional water to use the purification method you brought with you. In a hot environment, water might be a higher priority than finding shelter. It all depends on the environment and context. Ultimately, the topic of extended wilderness survival is enough to fill entire books. Many organizations also offer wilderness survival classes which you might be interested in. But the most important thing is to make sure that your "normal load out" is sufficient to support you in the even of an emergency. 

When I bought my first pair of walking boots, I was told to buy a jar of vaseline and use that on the hooks of the boots. You can apply it very precisely and it is very likely not to run off and spread over the boot. (Not sure how it reacts when it gets hot.)

While bunching up (see the answer by @Charlie Brumbaugh) works most times, it might be useful to have a method at hand that is less bulky for storing purposes. You can make a Chain Sinnet, which is a slip knot into which you pull a loop and repeat. When you fold your tarp or tent and find several lines together (making the bunches inconvenient as it makes too much of a bump) you can chain them together, by pulling all lines together into the loops and going on till the complete lengths are used. The final move of a chain that is in danger of getting undone is to pull the last end through the loop. But when putting the tarp in storage I would leave it without that last move to help in undoing when you use the tarp again. For shortening while using the tarp, the Chain Shortening will work, but best when the line is used. In that case you will need to fix the end of the chain, by pulling the end through or by tying an extra bit of string around the loop and the rest of the line.
