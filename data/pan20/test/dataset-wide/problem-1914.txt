Not. A collection of articles, websites, and links to StackExchange don't demonstrate your ability to do a computer security job. Anyone can list such resources - what matters is your background and understanding. Since you'll clearly need to apply for an entry level position, your educational background, experience in related fields, and ability to learn quickly. If asked during an interview about how you came to your current level of computer security knowledge, then you can mention a few sites and other resources. But spend most of your time discussing what you learned, rather than just the items you learned from. 

Certainly not with exactly the same details, but I've been part of several failed startups. It sort of goes with the territory - many burn brightly for a short period of time but flame out quickly. A few survive and come out the other side in good shape. But in my experience, that usually doesn't happen. 

When discussing salary and benefits you can either bring up the second requirement specifically, or make sure your new salary and benefits covers you without the need for a special allocation for paying your current company back. It's possible that your next company will give you the money you indicate you need to "break free" of your current company if they want you badly enough. In my experience this would be rather unusual (at least these days in my part of the world). Be prepared for the case where they say "No" to your special request. Decide ahead of time if this is a deal breaker for you or not. 

You are correct - don't point fingers. Just saying "bad management" would make a potential employer wonder what "bad" means to you and if you would conclude the same about them. Instead, focus on why this company is "no longer a good fit" for you. You can point out why being shorthanded caused problems. You can talk about the impact of being forced to cut corners. You may want to tread lightly on the "over-worked" aspect, if you feel you must bring it up at all. It's a short drive from saying "I'm over-worked" to being considered a whiner or someone who simply doesn't want to work hard (even if you are over-worked by a lot). If you are working 80 hours a week or such, you might want to talk about work/life balance but in general that's a phrase to avoid. Instead, ask questions about the working culture and see if you can get a sense if the pace, volume and intensity of the work meet your needs. In general when asked, talk about some of the problems you encounter without blaming management. Any interviewer with a clue will understand how those problems came about (it's virtually always about management) without being told. Be ready to answer the inevitable question: "So then why did you stick around for x months?" Perhaps you wanted to work hard and try to see if things changed for the better, but have only recently concluded that your efforts were futile. 

While nothing is certain in this world, it's exceedingly unusual that a verbal offer given and accepted is then rescinded. I've hired a lot of people and have never rescinded an offer. I've never had an offer I accepted rescinded. And I don't know anyone personally who has ever had that happen to them. I suppose it happens, but I've never personally encountered it. 

You simply tell them the truth about your medical condition forcing you to look for a lower-stress position. That way, you'll get feedback as to if this lower-level position is indeed lower-stress, or just lower-pay. In which case you'll need to look elsewhere. If you don't tell them the real issue, they can't help you, and will suspect your motives. 

Again, this comes across as a whine as well as a slam against your co-workers. Don't do that. You might express that your personal learning style works best when you can work/talk directly with someone. Either way, clean up your thoughts and language before having this discussion. You'll be far better off for it. 

Since you don't work for her, the only real power she could have over you is the power you give her to disrupt your work, or ruin your self-confidence. Don't let her do that. 

For me, waiting until after an offer is tendered is too late. If work-life balance is important to you (and I'm assuming you wouldn't have asked the question if it wasn't), then you should find out about it earlier in the process - before an offer is made. That way, you won't be under time pressure to accept the offer, and can make a choice that is good for you both personally and professionally. 

The instructor said it looks bad when people are on their cellphones in the office. If that isn't clear - ask. 

Their offer is only good if it's good for you. If 32k is less than what you need to live on, then it cannot be good. It doesn't matter if it is less than a number gathered from anonymous posters on some website or more. It's about your needs, your wants, your ability to earn more elsewhere. If the job gives you what you want in regard to opportunity, location, culture, and the salary is good enough for you, then it's a good enough offer to be worth considering. Stop worrying about what others may or may not be making. Start worrying about you instead. 

"Dear Ms Company-A decision-maker, While you have offered me a good salary, I've gotten better offers from other companies. Still, I'd really like to work at Company A. Can you offer more?" (You might decide to state outright how much Company B is offering.) Before doing this, make sure you are clear in your own mind what your decision will be no matter what the response from Company A: 

The successful explanations are the ones which are true for you individually. The unsuccessful explanations are the ones that come from trying to guess what the interviewer wants to hear. 

If you are applying for entry-level positions, then the lack of commercial experience won't matter. Still, you may have to answer the question "What have you been doing since graduation?" Be prepared with an honest well-thought-out answer. Explain how your disability held you back in the past, but how you have overcome it to the extent that it is no longer an impediment for you. If you aren't yet able to deliver that answer confidently, find someone to practice with, or take a video of yourself. Practice until you come across as confident, sincere, and ready to start working hard. Remember that "communication skills are a must" doesn't mean "must have perfect speech." Instead, it means that you must be able to communicate well with others. They must be able to understand you, and you must be able to understand them. Much of that will be written, some of that will be oral. Don't worry about this. 

Using phrases like "big talk" and "push them" can indeed make you that guy, so you don't want to go there. Consider asking your manager if it would be okay for you to create a presentation on some of the practices you consider important. Some companies have "brown bag talks" during lunch where such topics are common. If accepted, you can talk about what you are proposing, why you consider it important (hopefully not just because you feel it's a "best practice", but more about why it will benefit the team/company in their particular context), and how you all can go about implementing these ideas. Try to get the manager's explicit buy-in ahead of time, then use your powers of persuasion to convince others to get on the bandwagon. Sometimes suggesting a pilot project starts things off well - often starting small is the simplest way toward improvements. 

That depends on your goals, your sense of how your boss might react to some pushback, how averse you are to 15 minutes of free work, and how badly you need this particular job. You could decide that this just goes with the job and leave it be. You could choose to complain to management about the unfairness of this and ask if they would consider paying you. You could choose to seek legal recourse to try and force the company to pay you for the extra 15 minutes. (In my part of the world you usually need to be paid for all the time you are required to work. Check your local laws. Consult a lawyer or other counsel such as ACAS or Citizens Advice.) You could choose to skip the meetings and just come in ready to start at 10:00 or 11:15. Management may not like that. 

You could try that. Everything else being equal you probably want to land on the low end of your range, so that you'll have room to grow within it. But HR will review the job description and whatever range you choose to ascribe to the new job. They will then check against industry standards for reasonableness and correct it as needed. Remember, this won't likely just be "invented" data. HR won't just be considering you and your new role, but defining the role for the company going forward. If the job tree has levels of 0-2 and 3-5, then you may be slotting yourself correctly. But if it has levels of 0-3 and 4-8 for comparable positions in your domain, then you may not get away with a set of artificial boundaries. You could talk with HR and get their assistance. That could help it sail through more quickly. That, plus the backing of your manager might get you what you want. 

There are two ways for you to point out your abilities and lean them toward a supervisory role. On your resume, you list these activities as details in the section that describes your role. My Title - Big Corporation, Inc. (2001 - 2016) 

Yes. Your team lead already knows that you have some issues. And you have indicated that you are on "performance management" (I'll assume that is the same thing as a formal Performance Plan). Now is your chance to tell your team lead about the possible reasons behind your performance issues, and talk about the plan going forward to correct them now that you have a formal diagnosis. As you learn more about your medications and support group work, share them with your team lead as well (particularly if there may be side-effects evident in the workplace, or if you need to alter your work schedule to accommodate appointments or support group sessions). It must feel great to finally have this formal diagnosis completed! Share that feelings with your team lead, and find ways to work together to improve your performance. 

Not usually. Unless there is some drastic change in the level of benefits being granted in the upcoming year, benefits don't typically affect annual raises all that much. 

If 45.5k would be a comfortable salary that would make you happy, then it was the "correct" response. If you will be unhappy accepting 45.5k, then the correct response would have been higher. 

The best candidate should always get the position. But remember what the term "best" does and doesn't mean. For your particular opening, the best candidate might be one who will accept the low salary, can quickly learn the position, and can grow in the company for a long time. (For example, noting in your resume that you currently make much more money at your current job is a red flag to me that you won't be happy for long with a much lower salaried entry-level job.) Someone with a lot of experience may fill all of those needs. But often someone experienced will eventually chafe at the salary and growth aspects of the role. If you choose to interview experienced candidates for an entry-level position, you must dig in with questions designed to determine: 

When they ask for your GPA, you give it to them. If that disqualifies you, then they will tell you. Perhaps they will give you a chance to talk about it - that depends on the company's policies toward GPA. Some are more absolute than others. Unless you can find a quick way to raise your GPA, there's really nothing else to be done here. If you are very concerned, you could consider sending in your GPA sooner. That way, you'll find out if there is an issue sooner. 

It's always difficult to convey bad news to a team. My approach has always been to be honest and direct. 

With almost any aspect of interviews - nervousness, preparedness, dealing with rejection, etc - the key is practice and experience. Unless there are deeper, personal issues, most people realize over time that rejection is a normal part of the interviewing process. Hardly anyone, no matter their skill set, can completely avoid being rejected. After an interview which ended in rejection, think back (or even make notes) about how it went, what might have been done better, what you would change next time. Go over this as you prepare for you next issue. Remember that rejection isn't personal, it's just a normal part of business. There are many, many reasons you may not have been a good fit for the job. And most of those reasons have as much to do about the specifics of the job as they have to do with anything you may or may not be lacking. After you've gone through enough interviews, you'll likely come to realize that rejections just happen, that rejections aren't something demeaning or disgraceful, they are just a normal part of the process. Good luck! Relax and learn from each experience! 

Again, it may depend on your field. It also likely depends on the kind and depth of recognition you got. If your recognition made the cover of Time magazine, the national news, and the top search results of Google for a month, that may be enough to launch you to a successful lecturing career. If your recognition was "Team Member of the Week" within your department, that may not be sufficient for much of a seminar/lecture circuit career. 

I've always told the folks in my office that I don't want them working to the clock. Instead, I want them to work to get the job done. Sometimes that means leaving early, and sometimes that means staying late - they get to decide. If they want to leave right after me, and they can still get their work done, that's fine with me. (I get in before everyone else, and tend to leave at a reasonable time). But the only useful measure of "normal" is "whatever is normal in your particular office". If you are salaried, many offices don't care about the particular hours you work. On the other hand, if you are hourly, it might matter a lot - you might not get paid for the time if you leave early. If you are in a project-based role (a developer, for example), it may not matter when you leave as long as you complete your projects in a timely manner. On the other hand if you are in a service-based role (a client phone support person for example), your presence may be essential during your assigned work hours. Consider asking your boss what he wants you to do after he has left. If he says it's okay for you to leave, then you have your context-specific definition of "normal". If instead he tells you the kinds of work you could be doing even after he has left, then you know that he doesn't think leaving early is "normal". 

First, get clear in your own mind why this is such a problem for you. Something is happening that seems to bother you, but not others. Think about it and learn for yourself why. If you don't really know why it annoys you, you'll never be able to explain it cogently to someone else and ask that it stop. Then, find a quiet time and ask your colleague if you can talk privately for a minute. Explain the specifics of your colleague's behavior that bother you, and explain how it makes you feel. Ask that the behavior stop. Say it with a smile. Perhaps indicate that you like working with him (if you do) except for this particular behavior. After this, if you still aren't getting the behavior changes you feel you need, then it's time to talk to your manager. At that point, it's a problem with you, not with your colleague. Explain to your manager how this is bothering you and affecting your productivity. Discuss ways that you can deal with it. Perhaps moving your desk/cube is a good solution. That way, you might not need to see the behavior that bothers you.
