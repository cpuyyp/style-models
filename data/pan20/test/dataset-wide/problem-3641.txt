Swimming: This is another awesome option if you have access to a pool and can swim (or are interested in swimming). There's minimal impact on joints, works your entire body, and you'll have fun in the water. 

Many people have lost weight by controlling their diet and just minimal exercises. That being said, endeavor to be physically active. The more active you are, the less gym time you'll need to lose weight. Your current regimen is too light (it's okay as a beginner); you need to start ramping it up. While I'll personally go a different route, here's what you can do to your current regimen: 

Do all those exercises intermittently during the day and your stomach will feel tight all day. Tidbit: if you can add bodyweight exercises (planks, pull-ups, chin-ups, knee-ups, push-ups, reverse crunches,) to your weightlifting sessions, you should feel your abs muscles tightening more and more. Thanks. 

If you perform HIIT exercises often, you'll have lots of energy and endurance. So, you won't get tired easily and you certainly won't feel lumpy. It will also give you a toned look because your muscles are active. 

Contrary to popular opinion, weight training the upper body isn't the only way to gain mass; you can strengthen your lower body muscles (resulting in some mass increase) with biking, sprinting, and jumping. 

Hi Jimmyk (and welcome), First and foremost, you should not deadlift with dumbbells. Deadlifting 60-lbs on each arm is completely different from deadlifting a 120-lb barbell. Please, if you're interested in deadlifting and/or weight squatting, purchase a barbell (preferably an olympic-sized one). Second, you'll find newbie gains in almost everything in life, including exercises. If you start a diet program, you'll lose your weight faster in the beginning and then stall/reduce at some point. This is normal; don't obsess over it. As long as you continue the intensity, your gains (fat loss, muscle gain, etc) will continue. Again, if you're ready to gain muscles, you'll need more than 12-lbs dumbbells. You can't be good at cycling by riding a tricycle. You need the right equipment for the right result. Want to get ripped? Either join a gym that has the equipment or purchase your own equipment. Then, start a program such as StrongLifts, Starting Strength, or Wendel's 5-3-1. Their core principle is progressively increasing the weights being lifted Pick any of the programs, follow it for at least 2 months and observe the result for yourself :). Happy exercising :). 

First, congratulations for recognizing that you need to lose weight. You've taken the first step. Second, don't plan to "hit back to gym soon and work hard on the cardio." That doesn't usually work. If you can go for a walk right now, go for a 30 mins walk. If not, perform 10 squats. If possible, do jumping jacks (modify it if you cannot lift yourself) for 15 seconds. That's not planning; that's doing. Countless people plan to lose weight without actually doing something. Don't waste time planning; jump in and start doing something. Third, diet is an integral part and I'm glad you realize that. Starting tomorrow (or today, depending on the time) start your day with a protein-filled and fiber-filled breakfast. Make them low calories as best as possible; incorporate vegetables, lean meat, fruits, and nuts in your daily intake (both as food and snack). Fourth, the most effective metabolism-increasing supplements contain green tea. So, rather than seeking a particular brand, seek supplements that contain green tea. They naturally increase your metabolism and provide you with the energy to be more active. Fifth, take supplements that are rich in Vitamins B-complex. The vitamins naturally increase your energy level and allow you to be more active. You can also just go to a pharmacy and ask them to give you supplements that increase your energy level; they should provide you with supplements that have Vitamins B along with other nutrients. In summary, to lose weight: eat right, exercise often (and be active), and take the right supplements (not a requirement, but supplements provide many nutrients that aren't accessible through food alone). Welcome on your new journey to sculpt your body. Stay in touch for motivation, encouragement, and information on how others are faring on this wonderful journey. Good luck. 

Will milk and honey help you gain weight? The simplest answer is no. Unless you are drinking them in large quantities frequently (which wouldn't be healthy), you wouldn't gain longterm weight from them. You should drink those for their nutritious benefits and not as a weight-gaining gimmick. Lowfat milk contains protein and calcium, which can build your body and strengthen your bones. Honey is a natural sugar that has a lot of medicinal and nutritional benefits. To gain weight, do the same thing a weight-loss person would: Eat lean protein, vegetables, and fruits. Include complex carbohydrates in your diet and some protein shakes (every now and then). Then, lift weights.(your goal is to gain muscle weight and not fat weight, right?). There are many weightlifting programs online that you can follow (check out Starting Strength and Strong Lifts). Don't perform much cardio as they are meant for weight-loss, not weight-gain (I would prefer you perform some cardio from time to time because they're good for your lungs and heart). This way, you can increase your weight without increasing your fat size; you really don't want to gain fat weight. Hope this helps. 

Muhammad, Eat the yolk part (yellow part) of the eggs; it's very good for you. The yolk actually increases the good cholesterol in your body ( this, this) as well as provide a host of other nutrients such as 

In addition to the marvelous options provided by meanderingmoose, here are a few things to try as well: 

Can You Bench Your Friend? Theoretically Yes......but I think the biggest problem you'll face is your friend lying still like a barbell. Since humans instinctively fight for control when they're off balance, it might be relatively hard for you to keep your friend in the air. 

Cardio Cardio isn't needed to get stronger; however, it's highly recommended. Sprinting, running, biking, skipping, etc. are examples of exercises that can keep you fit and increase your endurance. Except for perhaps a treadmill or stationary bike, these don't require equipment. You can also forgo those equipment and run/bike outside. Also worth noting is that as you're consistent with these exercises, you'll grow stronger. None of these will happen overnight. But when they do, you'll be glad you started them. Now, head over to Simply Shredded and get some motivation for getting strong :). Good luck! 

Since you're not fat and you have a belly fat, it's likely as a result of your current lifestyle (unless it's a medical condition). 

Drinking your cold water is fine. And no, it doesn't defeat the purpose of the exercise. The purpose of the exercises (and the heat), according to Bikram Yoga is : 

Final reason is Strength. A lot of the people performing lateral pulldown use weights around the 100 lbs range (a lot of people I see actually use the 40 - 80 lbs range). That's waaaay low than these people's weights! As a result of this, the strength built is lower compared to pullups. Of course, since the weight is adjustable, pulldowns have the potential to build a very strong back (imagine a 200 lb man pulling down 200 lbs); however, the benefit-to-cost ratio is very minimal since there are better suitable exercises. 

Although all muscles constantly receive blood, they're rarely active unless they're used. So, warming up is like sending a message to the muscles: Get ready to work hard!
