The worry here is that what seems like a simple ding on the outside could have caused some delamination of the frame on the inside, which in turn would cause weakness. In general, a structurally intact laminated frame tube will make a clicking noise if you tap it with a coin. It should sound the same along the full length of the tube. A damaged one will usually make a duller thud. Notice I said in "in general" and "usually". This method is not an exact science and is no substitue for proper analysis if you are really concerned about it. This next advice may not be useful for your seatstay scenario, but if it is a larger tube you can get access at you could try to take a look inside with an Inspection Camera. Other than that, if you really want to be sure then it needs better analysis by a professional. Possibly an x-ray. If it is badly damaged enough that it should not be ridden, you might not even need a new frame. Carbon frames can be repaired. That being said, for what sounds like just a minor chip I'd go with your mechanic friend's advice and just keep an eye on it. Like Frisbee said, the bike shop is probably worried about liabililty. If it was the fork/downtube/toptube rather than a seatstay I'd be more concerned. If they fail it's not just your frame that will end up cracked. You'll likely have some cracked bones and teeth too. 

What isn't clear in the article is how effective the orange colour is. It was noted however 'the rate of deaths and injuries on the rail network has been reduced considerably'. I don't think there is enough research to prove any major difference between the two. Perhaps at the time it was about distinguishing rail workers from public service workers. I think it's also a matter of preference, from a UK site that sells high-vis jackets the choice of colour appears rather inconsequential. What ever colour you choose it's likely that the retroreflective stripes will be the most effective. 

I'd like to know how to identify bikes. I think that would be more valuable then If someone told me what brand I have. 

You can also create semi-studded tires by wrapping zip-ties around the tire, with the lock in the same position the screws are shown in the illustrated answer. You'd need a bike with disk brakes for this to work. So for a road bike it would probably be slightly less than practical. 

I really want to ride the Lotoja, from Logan, Utah to Jackson, Wyoming (206 miles). There's some beautiful scenery along that route (I've driven it several times) and enough up and down to make it really challenging. I also really want to ride the Salt to Saint, from Salt Lake City, Utah to St. George, Utah. Since it goes through my hometown and all... Also, some beautiful views along the route. 

My bike has several gears labelled one to six. Do these numbers relate specifically to a certain standard? In other words, would a bike set to say gear four on one bike, perform in the same way as another different bike set to the same gear? 

Copenhagen, Denmark Another interesting bike sharing system. What's unique about this system is that the bikes are free to use. 

I've bought a saddle bag with a set of bike tools; stuff like alan keys, puncture repair kits, spanners etc. There's this one tool (well two but they screw together) that I have trouble recognising. I know for sure it's not part of the installation of the saddle bag. It also didn't come with any instructions. 

I have used SPD and Crank Brothers (I have a set of Mallets on my mountain bike, and Candy SLs on my road bike). Both the Mallet and the Candy are built around the egg beaters. I have to say I greatly prefer the Crank Brothers. 

Lube your chain frequently. As in every time it rains if you need to. Depending on the drive-train, you can get Shimano or SRAM chains at places like Nashbar or Performance Bike, but even top-of-the-line, expensive chains will get rusty if they're out in the rain all the time. The same will hold with a Brooks saddle. No matter how awesome it is, if it's exposed to poor conditions without proper maintenance, it will deteriorate quickly. So lube your chain frequently, and dry it off whenever you get a chance before storing it. Disclaimer: If you go riding around with tons of lube on your chain in dry, dusty conditions, you'll pick up lots of dirt in your drivetrain. 

Like Gary said, finding something that does exactly what you want may be difficult. However, I like to use ridewithgps.com to plan my routes. It's optimized for cycling routes (so keeps you off freeways and can use bike paths if available) and you can have distance markers and points of interest markers along the way. I only use the basic plan. Their paid plans may have some extra tools that might be useful for your needs. Here's an example Camas to Onalaska. 

You might find some useful advice here ETA Cycle Insurance however, as mentioned by some commentators this is no substitute for expert legal advice. 

I'd like to see somebody prove you were "riding furiously"! What a strange concept. Remember, too, that insurance companies make profits by trying to avoid paying out claims, so this is often just standard procedure by them. Stick to your guns, and good luck. 

It's common etiquette, at least everywhere I've been, to stay away from wet and muddy trails (unless they're supposed to be or always are a mudfest). Riding on a muddy trail makes ruts which make the trail conditions worse for everyone once the mud dries and the ground hardens. In addition to ruts, if the trail is muddy and you slide out a front wheel going around a turn, for example, your wheel can scrape several inches of trail off. This can cause erosion problems later on. However, as alluded to earlier, if the trail is a known mudbog and stays muddy year-round, one more rut probably won't hurt anything. Another common counterexample is when the trail is melting in the afternoons but can be ridden early in the day when the ground is frozen. If you're crazy enough to be out riding then, more power to you. But generally speaking, it is in good taste to stay off melting, muddy trails. Any time your presence can alter the trail physically (ruts, slide-offs, feature damage), everyone else who shares the trail with you will be glad you stayed off. 

The Official Highway Code for the United Kingdom states that cyclists are only permited to cross on their bike when a green cycle symbol showing. If the light shows only a green man, you must dismount and push the bike to cross. If you are part of the traffic (not crossing from path to path) you must obey the red traffic light and stop. 

I'm trying to find what kind of brand/make my bike is so I can find more information about it. It might help me determine if I should buy a new bike. All I can tell from looking around my bike are the words 'Challenger' and 'Resistance'. It's a hand-me-down mountain bike, I haven't got a manual or receipt for the bike so I suspect there must be some way of finding out otherwise. I've searched for 'Challenger Resistance' on the web and the best result I received was from an auction on eBay of an identical bike. Here's what my bike looks like: 

When the man with the hammer comes to visit, the only thing that works for me if I'm far from home is to stop and get off the bike, and get some food and water into my system. Resting while the calories and water work their way into my system helps a lot. After my first really good bonk, I've never gone on a ride without taking at least one more GU than I think I'll need, and at least one more bottle of water or gatorade than I think I'll need. Extra weight be damned, I want to get home without wanting to die. That being said, it's still easier to prevent bonking than to "treat" it... 

Many of these claim to make you cooler (temperature, not social standing :-)) but whether they actually do or not is another matter. Some fabrics can certainly feel cooler to the touch, and thus may make you feel cooler when riding - which could give you a psychological performance advantage - but whether they physically help cool you down is another matter. Finding information on the actual technology and any sort of scientific testing is difficult. I ride in Florida and the temperature range can sometimes go from cool in the morning to very hot by afternoon. I've worn UnderAmour Heatgear base layers to keep warm at the start of a ride and found them to be fine when it warms up and they help to wick away sweat if you're not wearing a tight fitting jersey. However that's only up to a certain temperature. Once it gets beyond that I found it just makes you hotter. Another reason may be for sun protection. Many cycling jerseys are so thin they don't offer much. Some base layers offer a compression fit, too. Again, companies market this as performance enhancing. Whether that's true is entirely subjective, IMHO. Lastly, (and if you choose to wear a base layer because of this then you may want to practice riding more) they offer some physical protection. I hit the deck at 25 mph once. My jersey was torn to bits and my skin underneath would have been too if it were not for that fact that I was wearing a base layer that came away relatively unscathed. (The weather was warm enough that I didn't need the base layer, btw).
