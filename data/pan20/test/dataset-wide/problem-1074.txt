This is a sample matrix. The query should find all the green cells, with value = F (as is TO BE FOUND :) ) ... 

Because your hierarchy models is Group A -> Group B -> Group C, it's enough to store in [user_groups_data] table just the user_id, the last group id (in the groups hierarchy tree), and the info So, data in the tables can look like: 

* I'm not an ORACLE Dev, but the function should look something like the one above... Once you create the function, you will create a functional index that will use the function to look for the rows you need: 

I am using the same UserID and Password that I use to log into the Azure portal. And it's the UserID that is specified in the Access Control window. I am working from home, but I have also tried while on my company's VPN. Neither work. Is there something else I'm doing wrong? 

Service still would not start (although it looks like nothing changed, so I wasn't surprised). I've tried to start it from within the normal Windows Services, and from within SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Properties, I have tried to logon as all of the options on the Built-in account dropdown. I've also tried the admin account I use to connect to the DB from within SSMS. The service is set to Start Type automatic. I'm not sure what else to try. Any suggestions? 

FRA will be purged automatically when free space is needed Put the archived logs in FRA as well Use RMAN to make the backups and use RMAN commands (REPORT OBSOLETE / DELETE OBSOLETE) to manage the purging of backup pieces + archived logs from FRA 

From docs: ($URL$ The Oracle Flashback Database feature, which provides an convenient alternative to point-in-time recovery, generates flashback logs, which are also considered transient files and must be stored in the flash recovery area. However, unlike other transient files, flashback logs cannot be backed up to other media. They are automatically deleted as space is needed for other files in the flash recovery area. When Files are Eligible for Deletion from the Flash Recovery Area There are relatively simple rules governing when files become eligible for deleteion from the flash recovery area: 

in the server name when connecting via SSMS. Also, the username is an email address. Let's say it's: 

On my localhost, I am running 2014 (not express). I need to create a job, and for that, I need the Agent service to run. But I can't get it started. I have been googling the snot out of this, but so far no luck. In the Windows Logs, under System, I have only this: 

I am trying to connect to an Azure SQL database via SSMS. The connection string supplied by Azure is: 

Because both of them are virtual servers (you didn't mention the technology used (ESX/KVM...), you can try this: 

Inserting 10 rows each 2 minutes will result in (24*60/2)*10 rows per day (7200) -> that is not a large value to worry about. Also, it's great that you think on the "future - 10 years", but don't lose time with premature optimization. If your only concern it's about this table where you're inserting data every 2 mins, there's no point in creating additional databases (one per year), so let's stick with this table (Table_A). Now, because this table will slowly increase in time, and your want your queries to run fast, you have plenty of options: 

What makes me wonder if the database is actually inside the elastic pool is what's circled in red in the above screenshot. 

Another clue that the DB is not in the pool is that the pool shows no usage. So, I'm pretty sure I did something wrong. But I can't seem to figure out HOW to put the database inside the pool. Help!?! 

Bah. This server and elastic pool was created by my boss. I got permission from him to wipe it out and start over. When I created it myself, I was able to log in from SSMS no problem. 

Why would you want to use the DB to check for files ? Just write a shell script (if using Linux) or bat script (Windows) to check for the files, and use cron or Windows task scheduler to run that script. You can also create the INSERT query in the script (on Linux + MySQL that should be easy enough), and every time the files are checked, a new row should be inserted in your Frequency table. Don't try to use the DB for something that can be easily done at OS level. 

I am trying to set up an Azure SQL Database inside of an elastic pool. I'm not sure if I did it right. Here's my dashboard: 

(The was the name of the former developer who used to use this laptop. I am his replacement. For his sake, I removed his name.) Following some advice I found on other threads, I ran this against the master database: 

Not very helpful. I found the SQLAGENT.OUT file, but there is nothing recent in it. The last entry is from over a month ago. None the less, this is the contents of the file: 

Why not recreating the primary key as (nid, vid), and creating a new index on the column "order" (just for fast retrieval / ORDER BY clause). --> The worst that can happen is to have 2 ingredients with the same "order" value, but the order-change-logic should be already correctly defined in the application. 

2 questions: - Where is the IO problem ? On the master or on the replicas ? - If the IO contention is on a replica, can you create a TEST replica, replicating from the same master, but having innoDb engine ? The thing with MyISAM storage is that an UPDATE / INSERT query will lock the whole table. And the replication thread on each replica is also a serial process, running just one query at a time (event) from the master binlog. My suggestion would be change the storage engine for all tables, from MyISAM to InnoDb, then re-check the replication parameters. 

At first when I tried, I was told that the IP was not allowed. So I added the IP to the server firewall settings. But now, I get this: 

I am in the process of using the Data Migration Assistant to move a local DB to Aszure SQL. The schema transfer went well, and 243 of the 246 tables all were able to transfer their data with no errors. However, the transfer has been running for 13+ hours, and over the last three hours, three of the tables have not budged on their percent complete. One is at 92.3%, one is at 93.9%, and the last is at 98.5%. Some questions: 

Also, I believe that the application that's using your database already knows what those values mean. So what is the real use case for your constants ? If you really want to go with your approach, without changing the existing column type, you can create a function that will return the STRING value for each integer code: 

Your free space in the current innodb file (ibdata[1] ?) is decreasing. It doesn't necessarily mean that your website is slow. Maybe the number of users (concurrent users) has increased in the last few days ? (also causing lots of inserts int he DB?) There is no error in the print screen. it's just your monitoring system, reporting a value that have reached the critical threshold.
