Here's a scheme to produce slender (noetherian) 2-generated groups that contain all finite subgroups (and quasi-finite, in the sense that all proper subgroups are finite). Given a group $G$, let $C(G)$ be the set of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of $G$. A group homomorphism $f:G\to H$ induces a map $f_*:C(G)\to C(H)$. Let us say that $f$ is safe 

Indeed, since $L/[L,L]$ is torsion-free, any root of $z$ should lie in $[L,L]$ and the latter is readily seen to be the cyclic group generated by $z$. (Remark: $L$ is isomorphic to the integral 3-dimensional Heisenberg group.)$\qquad\Box$ I'll use three other very classical facts, without proof: the hardest (b) has both geometric and combinatorial proofs (the simplest using that $\pi_1$ of graphs are free), while (c),(d) are elementary exercises ((c) follows from Malcev's more general results but is very easy by hand here). 

Yes it's true. 1) First assume that $B$ is reduced (non nonzero nilpotent element). Let $I$ be the set of maximal ideals of $B$. Since for a f.g. algebra over a field, the Jacobson radical equals the radical, we have $\bigcap_{M\in I}M=0$. By the Nullstellensatz, for every $M\in I$ there is a unique $\mathbf{C}$-algebra homomorphism $u=u_M:B\to\mathbf{C}$ such that $\mathrm{Ker}(u)=M$. Thus we have a canonical embedding $j=(u_M)_{M\in I}$ of $\mathbf{C}$-algebras $B\to\mathbf{C}^I$. I claim that $j(f(A))$ is valued in the diagonal of $\mathbf{C}^I$ (the constant maps $I\to\mathbf{C}$). Indeed otherwise this means that $j(f(A))$ contains a nonconstant map, which means that there exist $M,M'\in I$ and $a\in A$ such that $u_M(f(a))\neq u_{M'}(f(a))$. So $u_M\circ f\neq u_{M'}\circ f$. This precisely contradicts the assumption. So $j(f(A))$ is contained in the diagonal (i.e., in the scalars of $\mathbf{C}^I$). Since $j$ is injective, this means that $f(A)$ is contained in the scalars. Hence the conclusion holds (with $L=\mathbf{C}$). 2) In general, let $R$ be the nilradical of $B$. Then the composite map $A\to B/R$ clearly satisfies the assumption, so is valued in the scalars. This means that $f(A)=(f(A)\cap R)\oplus\mathbf{C}1_B$, where the direct sum is in terms of vector spaces. This implies that $f(A)$ has Krull dimension zero (since its nilradical is a hyperplane, see details in edit below) and actually that $L=f(A)$ is local artinian. Note: the assumption on idempotents seems unnecessary. Conclusion: 

The answer is finally yes. Write $$f(x,y)=e_xe_ye_{xy}^{-1};\qquad R=\{f(x,y):x,y\in G\}\subset F_G.$$ Clearly the presentation $$\langle (e_g)_{g\in G}\mid (f(x,y))_{x,y\in G}\rangle$$ is a presentation of $G$, more precisely if $\Gamma$ is the group defined by this presentation and $\bar{e}_g$ the image of $e_g$ in $\Gamma$, we have a unique homomorphism $\phi:\Gamma\to G$ mapping $\bar{e}_g\mapsto g$ for all $g$. The first claim is that $\phi$ is an isomorphism. Proof: [added in edit] clearly $\phi$ is surjective. Now in $\Gamma$, the inverse of $\bar{e}_g$ is equal to $\bar{e}_{g^{-1}}$; in particular every element of $\Gamma$ is a product of some of the $\bar{e}_g$ (without inverses). Since in $\Gamma$ we have $\bar{e}_g\bar{e}_h=\bar{e}_{gh}$, this shows that every element of $\Gamma$ is equal to $\bar{e}_g$ for some $g\in G$ and $\bar{e}_1=1$, and it immediately follows that $\mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$ is trivial. Hence $\phi$ is an isomorphism.Â $\Box$ Thus, the normal subgroup generated by $R$ is equal to the kernel $K$ of the canonical homomorphism $F_G\to G$ (mapping $e_g\mapsto g$). The other (independent) step is to show that the subgroup $L$ of $F_G$ generated by $R$ is normal in $F_G$: Indeed, we have the formula $$e_zf(x,y)e_z^{-1}=f(z,x)f(zx,y)f(z,xy)^{-1},$$ showing that $e_zLe_z^{-1}\subset L$. Now let $U$ be the set of $w\in F_G$ such that $wLw^{-1}\subset L$. To show that $L$ is normal, we have to show that $U=F_G$. We know that $U$ is a subsemigroup of $F_G$, contains the positive generators, and contains $L$. It remains to show that it contains the inverses of generators. Indeed, we have $$e_z^{-1}=e_z^{-1}e_{z^{-1}}^{-1}e_{z^{-1}}=f(1,1)^{-1}f(z^{-1},z)^{-1}e_{z^{-1}}\in U.\quad\Box$$ We can now combine both steps: since $L$ is normal (by the second step) and contains $R$, it contains the normal subgroup generated by $R$, which by the first step equals $K=\mathrm{Ker}(\mathrm{can})$. So $L=K$. 

Let $Q$ be a chain (totally ordered set). Let $Y_Q$ be the graph whose set of vertices is the set of pairs $(x,y)$ with $x,y\in Q$ and $x<y$, and an edge between $(x,y)$ and $(x',y')$ iff the intervals $]x,y[$ and $]x',y'[$ are disjoint. If $Q$ is a 2-transitive chain then $Y_Q$ is a vertex-transitive graph. Let $D$ be an "open right" long line, so $D$ is locally order-isomorphic to the reals, for every $x$, the set $\{y\in D:y<x\}$ is order-isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}$ and every countable subset has an upper bound; Let $X$ be obtained by concatenation $D\sqcup\{x_0\}\sqcup\mathbf{R}$ of a copy of $D$, a singleton $x_0$, and a copy of $\mathbf{R}$. I claim that $Y_X$ is not vertex-transitive. Indeed, if $x<x_0<y$, then any complete subgraph in $Y_X$ containing the vertex $(x,y)$ is countable. On the other hand, there is an uncountable complete subgraph (consider uncountably may disjoint nonempty open intervals in $D$). Write $D=\bigcup D_\alpha$, ascending union of a chain of intervals all order-isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}$, and $X_\alpha=D_\alpha\cup\{x_0\}\cup\mathbf{R}$; then $X_\alpha$ is order-isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}$. Then $X=\bigcup X_\alpha$, and $Y_X=\bigcup Y_{X_\alpha}$, union of a chain of vertex-transitive subgraphs. 

You need a finite metric space $(X,d)$ such that the same space with the square root of the distance $(X,\sqrt{d})$ is not isometrically embeddable into any Euclidean space. An example is given by the metric space defined as the 0-skeleton of the graph with vertices $A,B,C,D,E$, and edges $\{AB,AC,AD,BE,CE,DE\}$ (so all the other distances are 2). Assume by contradiction that $(X,\sqrt{d})$ is embeddable into a Euclidean space. Denote by $a,b,c,d,e$ the images: then $ab,ac,ad,be,ce,de$ are 1 and the other distances are $\sqrt{2}$. The triangle $bcd$ is equilateral with edge $\sqrt{2}$. Each of $a,e$, along with $bcd$, forms a pyramid with base $bcd$ and other edges equal to $1$. So if $o$ is the center of $bcd$, we have, by basic 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry, $oa=oe=1/\sqrt{3}$. So $ae\le 2/\sqrt{3}$. But $ae=\sqrt{2}$ and this is a contradiction. So the distance matrix $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2\\1 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 1\\1 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 1\\1 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 1\\2 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$ is not conditionally negative definite. As far as I remember, a simple argument shows that no example exists in size $\le 4$. 

Initial answer (Jan 18' 2016) Start from any (finite-dimensional) complex nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ that is defined over $\mathbf{Q}$ and has a unipotent automorphism group (see e.g. Luks' Lie algebra top of p14 in (Ancochea Campoamor survey) for a 16-dimensional example), see also first edit (Jan 19' 16) below. Fix a rational structure, so we can defined $\mathfrak{g}_p$ as the corresponding Lie algebra modulo $p$ for $p$ large enough (i.e., not dividing any of the denominators). (Formally speaking, this means writing $\mathbf{g}=\mathfrak{h}\otimes_{\mathbf{Q}}\mathbf{C}$ for some Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ over $\mathbf{Q}$.) Then for $p$ large enough, the automorphism group of $\mathfrak{g}_p$ is a $p$-group. Indeed otherwise, if for a growing subsequence $(p_i)$ this is not the case, say $\mathfrak{g}_{p_i}$ has an automorphism of prime order $\neq p_i$, passing to the algebraic closure $K_i$ of $\mathbf{F}_{p_i}$ and then to a ultralimit over $i$ we get that the ultraproduct, which is a Lie algebra over the ultraproduct $K$ of the $K_i$ has a nontrivial semisimple automorphism. But this ultraproduct is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{h}\otimes_{\mathbf{Q}}K$. This contradicts that $\mathfrak{g}$ has a unipotent automorphism group. Note that this provides a group of order $p^{16}$ with some well-controlled nilpotency length (I haven't made the computation for Luks' Lie algebra but it's easy to do), but gives no control of $p$, although for small $p$ a computer computation is doable). 

Indeed, since $\rho(F)=\rho(G)=0$, they have fixed points $x_F,x_G$, we can suppose $x_F\in [x_G,x_G+1\mathclose[$. Fix $x\le x_F$. Then $F(x)\le x_F\le x_G+1$, and in turn $G\circ F(x)\le x_G+1\le x_F+1$. By induction, $(G\circ F)^n(x)\le x_F+n$. This shows that $\rho(G\circ F)\le 1$. The inequality $\ge -1$ follows by a similar argument, or applying this to the inverse. Conversely, all values in $[-1,1]$ are attained: 

Here's a cw answer so as not to leave this unanswered. If $p$ is prime, $D$ is a countable abstract set, then (1) the product $C^D$ has exactly $\aleph_0$ closed subgroup of index $p$ (recall that for a finite index subgroup, closed=open), but (2) it has $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ abstract subgroups of index $p$. The argument for (1) is topological: this is because the Cantor set has only countably many clopen subsets. The argument for (2) is algebraic (use that any vector space over $\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$ has a basis): if $R$ is an abstract set of cardinal $2^{\aleph_0}$ then $C^D$ is abstractly isomorphic to $C^{(R)}$. The set of subgroups of index $p$ is the projective space of $\text{Hom}(C^{(R)},C)=C^R$, and thus has $2^{|R|}$=$2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ elements. Some of these non-closed subgroups can, in a sense, be made explicit by considering an ultrafilter and consider the kernel of the natural map from the product to the ultraproduct. This is of course not really explicit since the ultrafilter itself cannot be made explicit. On the other hand, this latter argument works for an arbitrary nontrivial finite group $C$. 

No, it's not true. A cusp is a counterexample (see below for an example with no boundary). Here by cusp I mean the subset $\{\text{Im}(z)\ge 1\}$ of the upper half-plane with hyperbolic metric modulo $z\mapsto z+1$. This has finite volume and the fundamental group has linear $\mathbf{Z}$ growth, but the universal covering, which is a horodisc, has exponential growth (because the $n$-ball contains, for some $c>0$, the rectangle $[0,e^{cn}]\times [1,2]$, which contains exponentially many disjoint balls $[m,m+1]\times [1,2]$, which all have the same volume). If you want no boundary, take the cylinder $\mathbf{C}$ modulo $z\mapsto z+1$, endow it with the cusp Riemannian metric on both components of $\{|\text{Im}(z)|\ge 1\}$, and extend arbitrarily to a Riemannian metric in between. 

Proof of (b'): for convenience, we use complex coordinates and work in $\mathbf{C}^2$. Fix an element $\zeta$ in the unit circle of infinite multiplicative order. Define the diagonal $\mathbf{C}$-linear isometries $\alpha(z,z')=(\zeta z,z')$ and $\beta(z,z')=(z,\zeta z')$. Define $$X=\{(\zeta^n,0):n\ge 0\}\cup\{(0,\zeta^n):n\ge 0\},\quad x=(1,0),\;y=(0,1).$$ It is immediate that they satisfy the required hypotheses of (*). 

(For non-specialists: $G$ is embedded into $\mathcal{B}(\ell^2_{\mathbf{C}}(G))$ as unitaries induced by left translations, and its von Neumann algebra $LG$ is its bicommutant. To say that $LG$ is a factor means that the center of $LG$ is reduced to scalars.) By a classical result of Murray and von Neumann, the von Neumann algebra of a group $G$ is a factor (and then $II_1$-factor) iff the group is ICC, that is, $\mathrm{FC}(G)=1$, where $\mathrm{FC}(G)$ is the union of finite conjugacy classes of $G$. Equivalently this means that $G$ has trivial center and trivial finite radical, i.e., has no nontrivial finite normal subgroup. (That this condition is necessary is trivial.) If $G\neq 1$ is finitely generated and ICC, then $G$ is not virtually nilpotent. Among other groups, there are plenty of ICC groups: non-abelian free groups, etc, and also many elementary amenable ones too (e.g. polycyclic). In intermediate growth there are plenty of examples too (just-infinite groups such as Grigorchuk groups...). Actually, any non-virtually-nilpotent finitely generated group has a nontrivial ICC quotient. 

Inspired by McCool's paper given in Benjamin's answer, here's an explicit example that is finitely generated but not finitely presented: let $\phi$ be an injective recursive function from positive integers to themselves, whose image is not recursive. Consider the group with recursive presentation $$G=\langle t,x\mid r_{\phi(n)}^{n!}:n\ge 1\rangle,\quad \text{where}\;r_m=[t^mxt^{-m},x].$$ It is not hard to check that $r_{\phi(n)}$ has order $n!$ and $r_m$ has infinite order if $m$ is not in the range of $\phi$ (added: see below for a variant where I justify this claim) . In particular, the infinite order problem (checking if an element has infinite order) is not solvable. However this group has a solvable word problem. The idea is that given a word of length $n$, it is trivial in $G$ if and only if it is trivial in the partial presentation with only relators $r_{\phi(k)}^{k!}$ for $k\le n$, and word problem in these groups are (I think) simultaneously solvable although I haven't checked details. Actually McCool says it's enough to embed such a group into a group with solvable word problem, no need to care that the image is recursive. And indeed that's enough (clearly solvability of the infinite order problem passes to finitely generated subgroups). 

Sorry for adding one more answer, but here's a simple argument based on using that if the center is large enough then the commutator map has too small image to cover the derived subgroup, and even showing that, in suitable (varying) finite groups, the commutator length can be unbounded. Let $p$ be an odd prime. Consider the free 2-step-nilpotent Lie algebra over $\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$ on $n$ generators. It has dimension $n+n(n-1)/2$, and its center has dimension $n(n-1)/2$ and coincides with the derived subalgebra. The law $x\ast y=x+y+\frac12[x,y]$ defines a group law (this is the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula), defining a group $G$ of order $p^{n+n(n-1)/2}$ (and exponent $p$). The center $Z$ of $G$ has order $p^{n(n-1)/2}$ and coincides with the derived subgroup. The commutator map $G\times G\to [G,G]$ factors through $G/Z\times G/Z$, and hence its image contains at most $p^{2n}=|G/Z|^2$ elements. As soon as $2n<n+n(n-1)/2$ (i.e., $n\ge 4$), this implies that there are non-commutators. Better, this shows that the set of products of $k$ commutators has cardinal $\le p^{2nk}$, and therefore does not cover the commutator group if $2nk<n+n(n-1)/2$, that is, $n\ge 4k$. Notes: 1) This example (at least the existence of product of commutators that are not commutators) is certainly covered by Torsten's answer; however I provide a different argument. 2) More complicated elaborations, also based on the center being large, yield finite perfect groups with arbitrary large commutator width. 3)One can directly define $G$ as the relatively free group on $n$ generators in the variety of 2-step-nilpotent groups of exponent $p$, but then one needs to check by hand the statement on the derived subgroup and center. 

The example Misha refers to is 7-dimensional. The smallest examples are 5-dimensional, there are exactly two of them. The first $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra with basis $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ with nonzero brackets $[x_1,x_3]=x_4$, $[x_1,x_4]=[x_2,x_3]=x_5$. The associated Carnot graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}'$ (often called "associated graded" but this is misleading) has the same basis with nonzero brackets $[x_1,x_3]=x_4$, $[x_1,x_4]=x_5$. They are not isomorphic (because $\mathfrak{g}$ has 1-dimensional center and $\mathfrak{g}'$ has 2-dimensional center (actually it splits as a direct product product of the subalgebras with basis $(x_1,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ and $(x_2)$). The second example $\mathfrak{h}$ has basis $(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5)$ with nonzero brackets $[y_1,y_i]=y_{i+1}$ for $i=2,3,4$ and $[y_2,y_3]=y_5$. The associated Carnot graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}'$ has the same basis with nonzero brackets $[y_1,y_i]=y_{i+1}$ for $i=2,3,4$; they are not isomorphic, for instance because $\mathfrak{h}'$ has an abelian 1-codimensional ideal unlike $\mathfrak{h}$. In the first case, although the Betti numbers are the same, the groups are not quasi-isometric because the real cohomology algebras are not isomorphic as graded real algebras, and we can apply Sauer invariance theorem (which improves Shalom's). In the second case, it can be checked that the real cohomology algebras are isomorphic as graded algebras, and it is not known whether the nilpotent groups are quasi-isometric, it's indeed the smallest open case. In dimension 6 and beyond, there are plenty of examples. 

This is true (edit: I mean here: the existence of an action with one point with trivial stabilizer) when $G$ is countable, or more generally when it acts faithfully order-preserving on a countable totally ordered set: 1) If an arbitrary group $G$ acts order-preserving faithfully on a totally ordered set $(D,\le)$, then there exists a left-invariant total ordering $\le'$ on $G$ (so that the action of $G$ on itself by left-translation is free and order-preserving) Indeed, consider a well-ordering $\preceq$ on $D$ (unrelated to the total order), and define $g\le' h$ if $g=h$ or $g\neq h$ and the $\preceq$-minimal element $y$ of $\{x\in D:g(x)\neq h(x)\}$ satisfies $g(y)\le h(y)$. 2) If an arbitrary group acts order-preserving on a countable totally ordered set $(D,\le)$, then this action can be extended to an action on the reals. Indeed, first let $G$ act on $D\times ]0,1[$ with the lexicographic ordering (so that each $\{d\}\times ]0,1[$ is convex) by $g(d,t)=(gd,t)$, and extend the action to the Dedekind cut completion. The latter is isomorphic as a totally order set to the real line. 3) Using 1) and 2), if a countable group acts faithfully order-preserving on a totally ordered set, then it also admits a faithful action on the real line with a free orbit (i.e., so that at least one point has a trivial stabilizer). On the other hand, I'm not sure that the group $\text{Homeo}^+(\mathbf{R})$ admits an order-preserving action on $\mathbf{R}$ with a free orbit. (edit: obviously, as pointed out by other people, if $G$ is not abelian it's hopeless to expect to realize this action by a homomorphisms into the reals)
