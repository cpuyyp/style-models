Of course many people would say that the supernatural does exist in the real world, and that this has been proven over and over. Some people have philosophical beliefs that lead them to dogmatically reject the evidence. And of course "supernatural" is a broad term, covering everything from vampires and zombies -- which I think almost every would agree are fictional -- to ghosts and pychic phenomenon, to a creator God. How can we reconcile the supernatural with science? I would say, easily. There could be forces at work in the universe that our present science does not understand. Three hundred years ago electricity was a mysterious force of which people had only the vaguest glimmerings of knowledge. Today it is well understood. Perhaps there is some force behind ghosts or telekinesis, that today is viewed as at best fringe science, but that three hundred years from now will be well understood, and people will build machines to detect and measure this force. You say that you doubt there could be another form of energy that is presently unknown but that our science has not yet detected. I'd say, why not? It is just within the last hundred years that two of the four known forces, the strong force and the weak force, were discovered. People didn't know that electricty and magnetism were two forms or perspectives of the same thing until James Maxwell in 1873. Consider human understanding of electricity before the 1700 and 1800s. People observed some mysterious phenomenon that they couldn't really explain, like lightning, some crude early batteries, etc. These things were on the fringes of science. Advocates of psychic phenomenon could argue that we're at a similar place now in their field: a few phenomenon that are poorly understood, and therefore difficult to reproduce and difficult to study. But someday there may be a breakthrough, some fundamental new understanding, and then people will look back at our day and say, "Wow, why didn't they see that telekinesis, the Bermuda Triangle, gamma radiation, and ball lightning (or whatever) are really the same thing? It seems so obvious." (BTW For the record, I sincerely doubt that most psychic phenomenon, like mind reading, telekinesis, astral projection, et al, are anything but hoaxes and muddled observation. But I try to keep an open mind.) It's easy to imagine phenomenon that are rare enough that people rarely observe them "in the wild", and so have no idea how to reproduce. There could be beings who are capable of acting in ways visible to us, but who generally do not. Perhaps they are trying to hide, or perhaps they just don't care whether we know they are around or not. This description could apply to ghosts, angels and demons, aliens, etc. For example, I came across a study once where the researchers set out to investigate whether people can really be healed of illnesses by prayer. So they got a group of sick people, and then they got people to pray for half of the sick people but no one to pray for the other half of the sick people, and compare how many in each group recovered. They found that slightly more of those prayed for recovered, but the results were not statistically significant, and so concluded that prayer does not work. Except ... they mentioned in their report that they only told the people saying the prayers the first name of the sick person for privacy reasons, and they said that they didn't think this would matter as an all-knowing God would presumably know who they meant. But by the same reasoning, wouldn't an all-knowing God know that this was all an experiment? Wouldn't he know that the prayers were not genuine expressions of concern for the sick person but a cynical test? And wouldn't an all-powerful God be capable of healing or not healing regardless of these fake prayers? He might heal only those prayed for to prove his existence. He might ignore the prayers and heal or not heal in accordance with his own plans. He might heal only those NOT prayed for just to mess with people and get a good laugh. I've seen other such experiments that claimed to find that prayer does work. They're all meaningless. My point is, if some supernatural phenomenon is produced by intelligent beings, it could be almost impossible to study scientifically. An intelligent being who knows that you are experimenting on him could decide not to go along with the experiment, or to deliberately screw up the experiment, for any number of reasons. 

Short answer: To make it believable, don't make it a utopia. Make it flawed. Like any real society. I've read lots of stories that portray someone's idea of the perfect social order, and a very common problem is that the writer makes them too unbelievably perfect. G K Chesterton once wrote -- not an exact quote, I'm quoting from memory -- "The problem with most proposals for Utopia is that the reformer assumes that all the big problems have been solved, and then proceeds to tell us how he will solve the small problems. He simply assumes that no one in his society will want more than his fair share, and then goes to great detail to discuss whether his fair share should be delivered by automobile or balloon." If you tell me that in your anarchist society, there is no need for the government to regulate the economy because everyone trusts each other and there is no fraud or false advertising or breach of contract, I just won't believe you. If you tell me that your society has some very effective method for dealing with dishonest people, that could be plausible. I can believe that the right social structure could DISCOURAGE some types of bad behavior, perhaps by making it more difficult to get away with, perhaps by somehow convincing people to follow a higher standard. But if you want to tell me that your society has eliminated all dishonesty, greed, hate and cruelty, you can't just tell blithely tell me that it's because you have a better system of education or because your leaders set a good example or because there's no need for antisocial action because your society is so perfect. You've got to give me a very convincing, detailed explanation of how you intend to perform this miracle. This could form the basis of the story. A group of people establish this anarchistic society. This problem comes up. Here's how they solve it. Throw in some action or a romance subplot or whatever and you could have a good story. Another angle is to let the society not be quite a PURE anarchy. Let them have, say, some organization that tracks down and punishes dangerous criminals. Someone says, "But your society isn't really an anarchy. How are your Guardians any different from the police in my society?" And the anarchist gives some speech where he basically says, "Oh, okay, maybe we're not a pure anarchy, but we come much closer than any other society in history. Sure, some problems don't have obvious anarchist solutions. We're still working on it. Authoritarians have had thousands of years to work out their solutions to these problems, we're just getting started." BTW I've read many articles by libertarians that discuss how a pure libertarian society would solve some of the problems that their opponents bring up. Like, how would a libertarian society have local roads? If a private company owns the road in front of your house, what happens if they decide to impose a $1000 toll every time you leave your driveway? Etc. And my response is: Perhaps interesting as an intellectual exercise, but our present society is so far from being libertarian that these small number of hard cases are just not the issue. When you've eliminated government subsidies to favored campaign contributors, government control of education, government-run healthcare, government-run charities, all the absurd government regulations on how far toilet seats must be from the wall and what kind of light-bulbs people are allowed to use, government intervention in the media, etc ... THEN is the time to start thinking about whether it's possible to privatize local roads and the police force. 

Natural resources. Earth might have specific resources that are rare on the aliens' planet(s). Cheap labor. People with lower technology tend to be willing to work for less. If the aliens are way ahead of us, in their eyes we may be cheap labor. Specific skills. Just because people group A are more technologically advanced than people group B doesn't mean that they are better at EVERYTHING. Germany has been a leader in chemistry for centuries: many countries equal Germany in technology in general, but the Germans still outdo them in chemistry. Likewise the UK and US lead in medicine. Japan in auto manufacturing. France in wine. Etc. Different nations have historically excelled at different things. That's a big reason why international trade exists: if everyone in the world was equally good at every job, there'd be no reason to trade. Rather than shipping things around the world we'd just make everything ourselves. And that's among humans, where we all have the same basic genetics. Perhaps the super-advanced aliens have much poorer hearing than humans do, etc, so humans can surpass them at tasks that require good hearing regardless of our technological inferiority. 

Hmm, I don't see why such a scenario would inevitably lead to a dramatic change in forms of government. Yes, hereditary monarchy as practiced for most of history might become impractical, as the monarch's children would likely all be too young to rule when the monarch dies. But all other forms of government would be just as viable as they are today. Democracy would certainly still work. Sure, the candidates would all be under 25, but you could still have elections. I suppose terms of office might get shorter. Like presently a U.S. Senator serves for 6 years, which means anyone older than 19 when he's elected would never live to serve out his term. Aristocracy and one-party rule would still work. In such systems, basically the ruling class pick the people to be the next generation ruling class. No reason why they couldn't still do that. They'd be less able to pick their own children, but actually as a class rather than an individual this is less of an issue. Maybe your kids can't take over your job the day you die, but they can hang around and take over somebody else's job when he dies in 5 or 10 years. I'd expect the operations of government would change, as office holders would be less experienced and know they have less time. Bad ideas would probably be more likely to be made law because the rulers wouldn't have the experience to know that it didn't work the last six times it was tried. They MIGHT study history of course, but many wouldn't. And knowing that you only have a few years might well lead people to be more in a hurry. I can't wait until the next election to get this policy enacted because I'll be dead by then! We can't spend years debating this policy because we don't have that much time. So policies get rushed through. Sometimes that would be good: instead of debating endlessly let's do something! But often it would mean that policies get enacted with inadequate consideration and planning. BTW hereditary monarchy could be made to work if you adjusted the system. Say that your younger brother inherits the crown instead of your son, or your cousin, whatever. Of course such a world would face all sorts of problems having little to do with government per se. Education would have to be shortened: you couldn't afford to wait until 21 or 22 to graduate college if you're only going to live to 25. Hard to imagine someone being able to start a career before 15 or so, maybe 12 or 13 at the earliest, so half your life is over before you start contributing to the economy. And all the workers have much less experience, so productivity must be lower. If the species is going to survive, people would have to marry very young. And even if you have your first child at 15, you're going to be dead by the time he's 10. If you have a child at 20 you'll be dead when he's 5. So who's going to raise the children? You might say that life expectancies have been shorter in the past and people have managed. But life expectancy of the upper class hasn't changed much. I recall seeing a study once that found that the life expectancy of a U.S. senator has not changed since the founding of the U.S. (I presume because the upper classes have always had access to decent food and shelter, some semblance of medical care, etc.) So there have always been some number of older, more experienced and mature people to keep things organized. In this society, there wouldn't be any such person. 

I think it very unlikely that the time traveler would go insane. There are plenty of cases of people from very technologically primitive societies meeting people from more advanced societies. For example, when Europeans came to America in the 1500s, or numerous more modern cases where people from modern cultures met people in the jungles of Africa or South America who have not been in contact with civilization. Of course the primitive people in these situations don't understand much of the technology they see. If there's a conflict, their spears and arrows are likely to leave them on the losing end against guns. But they don't go insane. I just made a comment in this direction on another question, but let me expand here. A few years ago I saw a video made by a group of American missionaries working with some very primitive, stone age people in Ecuador. After some rough spots, like the natives killing five of the missionaries, they established good relations. At one point the grandson of one of the murdered men invited one of the killers to come to America to attend his graduation. He didn't understand a lot of what he saw. Like he understood money, but he didn't understand credit cards: You give them the card, he said, but then they give it right back. And after seeing moving walkways at the airport, he made the delightful comment that now he knows why Americans are fat: they don't walk on the trail, they stand on the trail and the trail moves. But he certainly didn't go insane. He wasn't overwhelmed by the technology he saw. He was just curious about a lot of things. Ah, I found the video on YouTube: "Beyond Gates of Splendor", $URL$ The part about the Waondani visiting America begins at about 1:20:00. My point being: That's about as extreme as it gets: Someone from the stone age coming to the 21st century. Sure, he'd have to learn a lot to function and be independent. But given time, I think this fellow could have done it. For someone from 18th or 19th century Europe or America, I think it would be fairly easy. If they wanted to be an engineer or a scientist they would have to catch up on everything learned in the intervening time. But just to function day to day and get a job in a non-high tech field, yeah, they'd have to learn everything from how to use a telephone to how to drive a car. But how long would that take? Months? Maybe a year or two? Cell phones and DVD players and microwave ovens and the Internet didn't exist when I was a boy, but I haven't had any particular trouble learning to use them. Even if the time traveler wanted to become an engineer, most people in such fields learn most of what they need to know to get a start in college, 4 years or so. The person would have to be reasonably intelligent and willing to learn, but, etc. 

I read a short story many years ago based on this premise of how teleportation works. Sadly, I forget the title or author. (It's been decades since I read that story.) But that author's idea was that the person in the sending booth is killed, and his body decomposed down to molecules that are then used to construct the body of the next person arriving in the booth. (Presumably you have to keep a reservoir, as some people have more mass to their bodies than others. I forget if the author got into this.) In the story, the inventor of the machine refuses to use it himself, because he doesn't want to be killed. The story ends with the inventor abandoning this objection and using his own machines. Which I thought was a rather anti-climactic ending. I guess the writer just couldn't think of anything else to have happen.
