The premise of your question is flawed It would mean that you have such a huge radiation density that it would most likely severely effect any living thing. Blocking (or jamming) wireless transmissions is not that difficult, but already takes a lot of energy if you do it locally. If you want to block every wireless transmission everywhere that'd be insane amounts of energy being pumped onto the earth. Probably more than the suns, since the atmosphere blocks most of that radiation. If you want to block wired transmissions you'd need even significantly more than that. You would need insane amounts of radiation on every frequency from 1Hz to 100GHz. Most of the frequencies are not very reactive with biochemistry, but some are. And also the frequencies used in current day technology are effecting biochemistry. Most of those are used so little no actual harm comes from it, but the amount of energy your proposed radiation would mean would destroy a lot. And it would also boil water, probably. (WLAN: 2.4GHz, microwave: 2.455GHz) I think even if you would ONLY have EXACTLY the frequencies we use for communication the side-effects of the radiation intensity on biochemistry would still be destructive. To conclude: Society would probably not exist anymore since everyone dies of cancer, radiation poisoning and other things. 

On the lit side, an eternal ruddy dusky sky greets those who go outside. On the dark sire, except near the terminator, you're in eternal pitch darkness, the only warmth ever reaching there coming from thermal convection, driven by winds caused by the planet's rotation. As the planet it tidally locked, there are no tides, no wind patterns driven by tidal activity. 

Don't use it in places where the enemy may gain access to the device. This is pretty much standard procedure where feasible. For example the first Meteor jets the Brits built during WW2 (yes, the first units were active before the war ended) were barred from flying over German held territory to prevent the aircraft from falling into enemy hands if it were to crash. Similarly, early radar equipped aircraft owned by both sides were not allowed to overfly enemy held areas. In both cases of course the security was moot as the other side already had similar or identical technology, but that was in both cases not known (though suspected no doubt). Also, you keep the people involved strictly incommunicado (or try to at least). That's how the secrets of Bletchly park and the Manhattan project were kept until well after the war. Not just was the machinery involved (early computers, nuclear weapons technology...) top secret to the point nobody except a few key people knew what they were working on or with, but those people were housed in remote areas with no contact with the outside world that wasn't strictly censored (and despite that, the Soviets were still able to steal the nuclear technology from the Americans by infiltrating...). Having a good story to explain the effects without exposing your secrets is core to the disinformation campaign that's going to be needed. So if you've broken the enemy's ciphers, be prepared to spread rumours about secret agents inside their security agencies. If you've a new weapon, invent stories about something else that'd people could believe can do the same thing. In the ultimate scam, invent and build entire labs and fake experiments and make sure the enemy gets wind of their "successes". The biggest hoax of all that was perpetrated like that was the US Space Defence Initiative (SDI/Star Wars) which never existed as such (or rather, never was more than a paper study, but fake experiments were staged to make the Soviets think that working prototypes existed of weapons entirely different from what was being studied and were ready for deployment). Smoke and mirrors... 

If we ignore that then there is no further answer to be provided, since the leftover question of what would happen to society is very opinion-based. A more realistic scenario would be a world-wide EMP. But the problem of the question being mostly opinion-based is still there. 

Yes, we could stay healthy To my understanding the reason behind the weakening of a mars colonists bone structure is that they are permanently experiencing low gravity and their body is "overequipped" for that. So over an extended period of time the body will build less bone support. (People born on Mars would never even have a bone structure as strong as ours) In my opinion the bone structure would not decay as it is still required daily. They would severely struggle for 16 hours a day if the structure was weakened. There is still a need for that, just as there is on earth. So there would be no or barely any decay in the structure and thus no impedance of ones health. 

So your ecosystem would have to be such that megafauna exists, and has the plant and animal life for it to feed on, in order to sustain the shark population. The few blue whales (and other large whales) in our oceans will probably not do, they're too few and far between to provide reliable sources of sustenance to a viable population of megasharks. 

For now they're just implanted under the skin, in a leg mostly. Pets of course have been implanted with RFID chips for decades, usually injected into the shoulder. 

EDIT: Bridgeburners pointed out that since it's time dilation by velocity and not gravity you have to take into account that it is a more difficult scenario and the perceived time changes strongly depending on the observer. I did not properly clarify that this might not be the effect you were going for. 

Mirrors do not reflect every wavelength on the electromagnetic spectrum. Mirrors are designed to reflect the visual spectrum (350nm to 700nm) but there are lasers in a huge variety of wavelengths. As long as the laser is powerful enough you can destroy most things in it's way. 

Had they had more submarines they'd of necessity have had fewer aircraft, tanks, and other ships. Germany was severely resource limited both in raw materials, fuel, and manpower after all. So had they employed more submarines their land and air forces would have been less capable, maybe far less capable. While this may not have hurt them much against the western allies in the early stages, the campaign against the USSR would have gone bad even sooner, as would the campaigns in northern Africa and maybe even France. 

It would work (within reasonable limits) There is always side-effects to tampering with brain-chemistry. If it was the best for the brain to simply work faster then why would it not have evolved that way? Of course you burn a lot more calories, but there is other stuff, too. Hormones might be released and you get into emotional distress or you could have long-term effects like depression or dependency. Differing results Let's take current day drugs that work with brain-chemistry in different ways. Marijuana as an example. It does different things with every person. Of course the main tendency is to calm them down and make them hungry, but for some rare people the same strain causes panic attacks, paranoia or even psychotic episodes. (note: marijuana is a rather weak drug and is comparably not that dangerous) Body chemistry imbalance Also the side effects do not even have to be psychological or neurological issues, but can make your body chemistry go nuts and cause an imbalance in other organs causing them to malfunction when effected to severely. Physical limitations Then there is also the hard limits of the body. In the human body a signal travels about 128 m/s. So even if you were to enhance the speed in which neurons fire you wouldn't greatly increase that speed. If a signal is supposed to travel 20cm in your brain it would at least take 1.5ms to reach the destination. You can not enhance the 'computational power' indefinitely. Conclusion There are already methods to enhance focus, but they all have side-effects to some extend. None of the methods can boost indefintely. You could argue that an aliens physiology might be better "boostable" and with futuristic technology it can work to much stronger extends, but even then it will have its limitations. There is no inherent issue with "boosting" biochemistry. Just side-effects and limitations. 

Being a red dwarf, it will have a relatively high percentage of its energy output in the infra red part of the spectrum. The planet will be bathed in a dim ruddy light, with lots of infrared energy warming it up. The star will likely be far less volatile than our sun, so don't expect short duration climate cycles like El Nino. Climate will be a lot more stable overall. 

Of course the detail level of such a sense would depend heavily on the wavelength of the signals being received. You simply can't "see" something that's smaller than that. Mind that this is a simplified picture, as distance increases you need a shorter wavelength to see something (which is why you can't see a grain of sand on the moon using even the strongest, most perfect optical telescope from earth orbit). 

When defending they can make sure there are not long lines of sight. Placing objects everywhere, etc. When attacking humans who can see further it gets more difficult, if they themselves are prepared, because they would do the opposite and have long sightlines. The short-sighted ones would need to disrupt sightlines with smokescreens as people pointed out in the comments. When they have access to current military technology they would have stuff like strike drones, etc. They just need to be able to watch a screen and not see into the distance. In short: They will not ever stand a chance in soldier battles, but they are basically on even footing with humans in everything else, so they would not need special tactics with this. 

The virus used there seemed believable, and the distribution method ingenious. Little spoiler: he went for a genetically hardened version of Ebola, with a very clever way of distributing it (which I won't mention, read the book). He touches on the same issue in Executive Orders, using a completely different distribution system. 

Your criteria make little sense. In your pacifist society there's no need for regulation and bans on weapons, as people have no interest in using them on each other so they're used exclusively for sports and hunting. That situation can only arise if crime is just about non-existent, which in itself can only happen if there is no greed (note I don't speak about no poverty, there will always be a level of relative poverty where some people have more than others, it's just that in your ideal world people wouldn't mind others having more than them and people in real need will find charitable organisations and individuals eager to help them). Armed forces are by their very nature capable of offensive operations. This stems from the truth that the best way to defeat an enemy is to take the fight to him. A purely defensive force would eventually be overwhelmed easily. If there is no crime there's no need for police... How are you going to deal with religions that by their very nature are discriminatory/exclusive and/or violent towards outsiders (which includes a lot of religions, including at least one of the major world religions we have today)? They'd either have to be forcibly banned from the country (so no religious freedom) or they'd find it a very easy target for forced conversion and the elimination of everyone else, ending your state of pacifism quickly. Your atmosphere of safety and harmony can only exist if there is no crime. If you forget about the struggles that brought about your current society you're rapidly going to lose the benefits of that society as people forget what sacrifices were needed to bring it about and become greedy for the wealth of their neighbours. The first wave of muggings and robbery/murders won't be far behind. Privacy won't be valued, as people won't feel the need for it. And it can't exist as the only way to force people into being friendly and meek towards each other is constant highly invasive surveillance, cameras and microphones recording every conversation, censorship of all media (which you yourself already hinted at several times), police coming in the middle of the night to take away to "reeducation centers" those who so much as are suspected of harbouring thoughts that don't meet with approval of the government/ruling body/whatever you want to call it.
