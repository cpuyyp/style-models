This is sort of a complicated question from a physiological point of view. Muscle is made of myocytes (muscle cells), which are made of a few things of interest in relation to your question. Let's look at a diagram: 

Furthermore, I've attempted to recompose my physique with strict calorie counting, daily meal plans, and internet workout plans and I haven't had much success. I did a really dirty bulk about 5 years ago, then lost about 30 lbs with the intention of recomposing and it turned out pretty poorly. I lost a lot of muscle mass along with the bodyfat. I moved backwards quite a bit. In my experience, training organically, without the intention of recomposition has proven more successful than training simply with the intention of recomposition. 

As for foods, get at least one gram or protein per pound of bodyweight per day. Limit refined carbohydrates like fruit juices, soda, sugars, etc. Eat filling carbohydrates that are high in fiber such as fruits and vegetables and you'll naturally feel full while keeping your caloric intake down. Avoid alcohol. Eat a cheat meal once or twice a week. 

Welcome to the community! As you may know, the glutes are the largest and most powerful muscles in the human body. Some exercises, if performed with proper form, simply can't be done without major glute activation. Based on your complaints, here are a few of things I've identified that are standing in the way of you getting the results you want with your glutes: 1. Poor muscle recruitment Let's start here. I'm saying this because you mentioned that you have big quads and calves from working hard on the lower-body. What this tells me is that you don't have a strong mind-muscle connection with your glutes. This is called a neuromuscular recruitment pattern, which basically means you use your quads to do most of the work because that's how you've developed. This is really common. Just google "quad dominant squatting" or "squat glute activation". The fix involves learning how to use your glutes. Recruitment patterns develop over thousands and thousands of iterations. You'll need to spend some time doing movements that should activate your glutes, but actually concentrate on activating them. You'll have a tendency to revert to your habitual (incorrect) form, so you'll need to be diligent in letting yourself start from scratch. To do this, we need to put a stop to the anterior pelvic tilt. This is super common with people who spend most of their time sitting: 

Odds are your knees are not tracking out far enough. You should be spreading your knees as wide as possible throughout the movement. A perfect front squat is performed with the toes pointing straight forward. If you don't have the flexibility to do that, it's okay to point your toes out a bit. The further out your toes point, the worse it is on your knees. A good range of motion test is to try doing a full squat (butt to ankles) with your feet together without falling backwards. You should also be able to reach the same depth with your feet at shoulder width. You should also be concerned about thoracic extension. Hopefully you are performing this exercise with a clean grip rather than a folded-arm grip. A zombie squat is also acceptable if you don't have the mobility to use a clean grip. This will help force your pelvis to remain level throughout the movement because you won't be tempted to compromise hip position by leaning forward. 

Your body will consume energy to feed your brain Your body will consume energy to maintain its temperature Your body will consume energy to maintain your muscular mass Your body will consume energy to feed the central system (mainly, the nervous and endocrinal systems). 

When you lower down your energy (food) intake, you're right to say that not so many things can be adjusted. But definitely the first things to drop down will be your central system quality level (sleep of less good quality, hormonal state a bit down, less strength...) and then your muscular mass, hence reducing the energy consummed every single second. That's why when some people go on an uncontroled diet they not only loose fat but drop down their metabolism, making it then really easy afterwards to gain weight again. I hope I helped a little bit. Cheers! 

Full rest, with an every other day stretch/abs routine (my bad, that's right to say I'm not focused enough on my abs normally so I don't think these need so much rest) 3 times a week full-body routine with lighter weights 

I'm usually free squatting (8x) and leg pressing (4x) For a change, and also to see whether I can improve 1-my hip flexors and 2- the bottom part of my squat, I want to include 4x box squatting, (with wide stance, if you wondered) instead of 4x regular squat, having at the end 4x of each method. Should I do the 4x standard squat first or 4x box squatting first? I would tend to fatigue my hips first to later emphasise the quads by starting with the box squat, but I'm not so sure. What do you think? Thank you. PS: my current workout plan is a 4days per week routine: 

Here are my 50 cents. I would say, by reading your question, that it is convenient to remember that the 3 following things are totally different: 

So, now that this is clear, let me see whether I can help about the metabolism. Your basal metabolism is if I'm not mistaken defined by the energy your body is consumming when resting (extended on a bed, for example). This involves many different aspects that I don't control totally, but the main are: 

That's already almost 2 months that I've started a body building routine that gave me good results (which is why I decided to extend it until now). The program is volume based, a typical 4 days / week routine with 6-10 reps / set, however I really give everything I can and I don't skip leg day, euphemism inside. My question is the following: being intermediate in the discipline, what is the kind of recovery week you would recommend for me? I'm going to start another program which will be intense as well after that. I was thinking of 2 options: 

These 3 elements are complementary, not necessarly interconnected. Remember that you will have body issues even on a high calories diet if you don't pay attention to what you eat.
