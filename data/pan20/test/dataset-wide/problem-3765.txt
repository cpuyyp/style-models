$\textbf{Edit 3:}$ From wall's classification we get the decompositions . When n is odd $V(d,n)$ can be written as a connected sum of manifolds $$M_1 + M_2 + \ldots +M_k$$ where $H_{n-1}(M_i)=\mathbb{Z}$. . When n is even $V(d,n)$ can be written as a connected sum of manifolds $$M_1 + M_2 + \ldots +M_k'+M_{\mathbb{Z}/d}$$ where $H_{n-1}(M_i)=\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_{n-1}(M_{\mathbb{Z}/d})=\mathbb{Z}/d$. . Moreover Each $M_i$ and $M_{\mathbb{Z}/d}$ are stably parallelizable. 

I have the following reference in mind: Franz, M. "The integral cohomology of toric manifolds." Tr. Mat. Inst. Steklova 252 (2006), Geom. Topol., Diskret. Geom. i Teor. Mnozh., 61--70. the paper is available on arxiv. In this paper the author explains how to compute the cohomology thanks to the Stanley-Reisner ring (theorem 1.2). This is nice but for the cup product structure theorem 1.2 gives the right algebra structure only in some special cases, the general case is a conjecture. 

Let $M$ be a $1$-connected, closed, smooth manifold with $dim(M)>4$ and let us set $MCG(M)=\pi_0(Diff(M))$. Dennis Sullivan proved that $MCG(M)$ is commensurable to an arithmetic group. 

M. Atiyah has posted a preprint on arXiv on the non-existence of complex structure on the sphere $S^6$. $URL$ It relies on the topological $K$-theory $KR$ and in particular on the forgetful map from topological complex $K$-theory to $KR$. Question: what are the nice references to learn about $KR$? Edit : Thank you very much for the comments and suggestions, M. Atiyah's paper "K-theory and reality." Quart. J. Math., Oxford (2), 17 (1966),367-86 is a fantastic paper. However I have more questions. Question 1: how to build the morphism $$KSp(\mathbb{R}^6)\rightarrow K^{7,1}(pt)?$$ Question 2: why do we use $\mathbb{R}^{7,1}$? In fact I do not understand the sentence "The 6-sphere then appears naturally as the base of the light-cone". And why it suffices to look at this particular model of $S^6$. 

Have you looked at Mathai-Quillen's paper: "Superconnections, Thom classes, and equivariant differential forms." Topology 25: 85-100 (1986)? Where they build a form representing the Thom class (together with some very nice properties). You can also look at: "Mathai-Quillen Formalism" Siye Wu available on arXiv(hep-th) (section 2.2). 

Concerning your first question, I think a good place to learn about it is Markus Banagl's book "Topological invariants of stratified spaces" (chapter 6) or have a look at Paul Siegel's paper "$KO$-homology at odd primes" Amer. J. Math. 105 (1983), 1067-1105 (in particular the appendix where Sullivan's approach is explained). In Siegel's paper you have a bordism theory $\Omega^{Witt}_*(-)$ build from cobordisms of singular spaces called Witt spaces. A Witt space $X$ carries rational homology L-classes $l_i\in H_{dim(X)-4i}(X,\mathbb{Q})$. This homology $L$-classes were defined by Goresky and McPherson in this singular context extending the homology $L$-classes of a manifold $M$ which are poincaré dual to Hirzebruch $L$-classes $L_i\in H^{4i}(M,\mathbb{Q})$: $$l_i(M)=L_i(M)\cap [M]$$ 

Let me use the normalized LS i.e.: $Cat_{LS}(S^n)=1$. By definition $Cat_{LS}(X)=0$ is equivalent to $X$ contractible. And $Cat_{LS}(X)=1$ corresponds to the case in which $X$ is a co-Hspace. This follows from the characterization of LS-category in terms of factorization of the iterated diagonal: let $X$ be a connected CW-complex then $Cat_{LS}(X)\leq n$ if and only if the iterated diagonal map $X\rightarrow X^{n+1}$ factors through the fat wedge $T^{n+1}(X)$. I think you will find a proof of this result in many places ("Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category" by Cornea, Lupton, Oprea and Tanré). You can also have a look at James'paper: "Category,in the sense of Lusternik-Schnirelmann" Topology. Vol. 17. pp.331-343 1978. LS-category of Lie groups is difficult to compute for example: $Cat_{LS}(SU(n))=n-1$ (Singhof). We also know that $Cat_{LS}(Sp(3))=5$ (Fernández-Suárez; Gómez-Tato; Strom; Tanré "The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $\rm Sp(3)$" Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 132 (2004), no. 2, 587–595). To my knowledge we do not know the category of $Sp(n)$ when $n>3$, but we know some bounds: Macías-Virgós; Pereira-Sáez; "An upper bound for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the symplectic group." Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 155 (2013), no. 2, 271–276. The LS category of the Lie group ${\rm Spin} (n)$ is known for $3\leq n \leq 9$. Edit: Let me say more about LS-category of H-spaces, take the $n$-torus $T^n$ then $Cat_{LS}(T^n)=n$, a lower bound is given by the cup-length which is $n$ and an upper bound by the dimension which is also $n$. Also using cup-length you can prove that $Cat_{LS}(K(\mathbb{Z},2))$ is not finite, but on the other hand we know that $K(\mathbb{Q},1)=2$!! If LS-cat determines co-Hspaces, I am not aware of any nice statements about LS-cat of $H$-spaces (you can certainly say something about the rational LS-category of simply-connected H-spaces). 

I am considering the following situation. Let $M_5$ be a 5-dimensional manifold which is an $S^1$ principal bundle over 4-manifold $M_4$. For instance, $M_5 = S^5$ and $M_4 = \mathbb{CP}^2$ with standard Hopf fibration.Now there is a principal G-bundle (or associated bundle $adP$) over $M_5$. My question is, how to characterize $P$ over $M_5$, and is there a canonical induced bundle over $M_4$? Let me explain my question a little bit. I know that, for even dimensional manifold $X$, characteristic numbers (integrating over $X$ the characteristic class built up by curvature) can efficiently characterize principal. But in odd dimensional cases, I'm not sure how to do similar thing. One thing I can imagine is to integrate characteristic classes over all even-dimensional cycles. Secondly, suppose there is a way to characterize $P\to M_5$. Then I would like to know if there is a natural principal induced bundle $P'$ over $M_4$, and how to use the data of $P\to M_5$ to describe the induced bundle $P' \to M_4$. If possible, we can take some simple cases. Say, the Hopf fibration. Principal $G$-bundles over $S^5$ are characterized by $\pi_4G$, and they are $0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as I check a list of homotopy group for Lie groups. If I take trivial $G$-bundle over $S^5$, do I get a trivial bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (do I get new "twist" in the process of inducing bundle)? And what about other situation? Thanks. 

Let $M$ be a compact contact manifold with $R$ the Reeb vector field. Let $E$ be some vector bundle of gauge group $G$, say, $G = SU(2)$ and $E$ is the adjoint vector bundle. So my question is: If $\sigma$ is a global section, can I perform a gauge transformation (select a new trivialization) such that the transformed $\sigma$ satisfies $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$? To me the answer should be positive, since I can always adjust the basis so that the condition is satisfied, but I'm not sure. Edit: Here $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is understood as $\mathcal{L}_R\sigma_i = 0$ where $\sigma = \sigma_i e_i$ with $e_i$ a local basis in every trivializing patch. $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is not a geometric relation, but more like a gauge-fixing condition. 

========Update:======== Let me ask a enhanced version of question. Suppose the (1,0)+(0,1) decomposition induced by the almost contact structure satisfies the conditions (for some $Z^{1,0}$ and $Z'^{1,0}$ ) \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right] = {Z^{1,0}} - d\kappa \left( {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right)R, \end{equation} \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},R} \right] = {Z'^{1,0}} - \left( {...} \right)R, \end{equation} 

In Blair's book and many many literatures, I see definition of a contact metric manifold which involves a relation \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} as well as other standard relation like ${\Phi ^2} = - 1 + R \otimes \kappa $, $\Phi R = 0$, etc. On the other hand, in Tanno's papers and a few others literatures, the definitions involves \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = 2 g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} differing from Blair's by a factor of $2$. So I try to figure out which is "more correct", and then comes one important equation that really confuses me, in Blair's book (Lemma 6.2): \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X - \Phi hX, \;\;\;\;h \propto \mathcal{L}_R \Phi\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*) \end{equation} Now, let us consider the contact metric structure to be K-contact, and therefore $h = 0$, ${\mathcal{L}_R}g = 0$, and also equation $(*)$ should still hold, hence (in components) \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X \Leftrightarrow {\nabla _m}{R^n} = - {\Phi ^n}_m \Rightarrow {\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {g_{nk}}{\Phi ^k}_m\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(**) \end{equation} On the other hand, since $\nabla$ is Levi-civita, we have \begin{equation} {d\kappa } \left( {X,Y} \right) = \left( {{\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m}} \right){X^m}{Y^n} = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n{X^m}{Y^n} \end{equation} and therefore ${\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m} = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n$. Now comes the final point: using the Killing vector equation ${\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {\nabla _n}{R_m}$, one obtains \begin{equation} - 2{\nabla _m}{R_n} = 2{\nabla _n}{R_m} = - {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n \end{equation} which directly contradict the equation $(**)$ So my question is 

It may require physical simulation to find the critical heights I am defining below, and it will obviously be a function of the material used to make the die , the surface onto which it is rolled, and of the frictional coefficients $\mu_{die}$ and $\mu_{felt}$, and the nature of the rolling mechanism used to toss the die onto the felt (most likely the tumbling action in 6-dimensional state-space describing the initial velocity and rotational movement of the die and the height at which it is released, etc.) Because of symmetry, we can say $p_{top}=p_{bottom}=x,$ $p_{i\in(1,8)}=y$, $ 2x+8y=1$, $0 \le x \le 1 \textrm{ and } 0 \le y \le 1$ There will be a critical height $h_{min}$, where for $h \lt h_{min}$, the bias for "top" and "bottom" will be greater than for the prismatic faces, and $x \gt y$. There will also be a critical height $h_{max}$ where because the long axis is substantially longer than the flat octahedral faces, the momentum will be such as to cause a die landing on an octahedral face "top" or "bottom" to continue to move and fall/topple onto a rectangular prismatic face, with each of the 8 prismatic faces equally likely. Somewhere between the critical maximal and minimal heights will be a fair height, $h_{fair}$, where this non-regular die will roll fairly onto any of the ten faces with $$p=\frac{1}{10}=0.1$$ Now this is a rotationally symmetric die with 8-rotations around the long axis and 2 orientations of the long axis, so it's not the "assymetric die" you've asked for, but it could be the beginning for a similar construction of an asymmetric die. 

David, your question makes the assumption that players will stochastically pick a move in the current possible set of branches, and does not say anything about the current depth of the tree. I believe that for certain states, particularly those labeled "end-games", it is possible for an astute player (or an experienced player) (the set of astute and experienced players are not equal) to have a higher $W$ percentage against an equally skilled or worse opponent. Thus I believe that $W$ and $D$ are not just functions of one player $P_1$, but also of - the opponent $P_2$ and of - the current-depth of the game tree (= the number of moves played thus far), and - the current-state (global and local) of the game board. $P_1$'s $W$ may change for a different opponent and for certain opening sequences or end-games with which they are familiar. Now if you allow the assumption that you do not have an oracle evaluation function, but do have the win and draw percentages for two players, $P_1=(W_1, D_1)$ and $P_2=(W_2,D_2)$, your question in the second paragraph asks if that is sufficient to allow for calculating the probabilities of one player dominating over the other. I do not believe that there is a way to calculate this, as the $W$ and $D$ ratios are going to have to be calculated as a measure over all possible game board states, and the finite sampling of win and draw ratios for a finite number of games and board positions will not be sufficient to allow for such an extrapolation to be made. Back to my first ruminations: the $W$ and $D$ will depend on the depth of the game tree and the relative experience of the players. If a player picks a bad move but has better experience, she could still recover and win at a later point in the game. If a player picks a bad move but does not have much experience, they are less likely to be able to recover and get to a position of advantage. An experienced player recognizing classic openings may play by rote for a few moves, or may in fact feint and play slightly askew to see how her opponent responds. This type of psychological repertoire and skill cannot be encoded and captured in a two parameter model, and is also why I think $W$ and $D$ ratios are not just a function of the player $P_1$ but also of the opponent.
