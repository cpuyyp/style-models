Suppose $A$ is a associative unital $k$-algebra, where $\operatorname{char}k=0$. As is well-known, $A$ becomes a Lie algebra with respect to the commutator bracket $[x, y] = xy-yx$ for $x,y \in A$. Let $P$ denote a finite dimensional Lie subalgebra of $A$ with respect to this bracket. Suppose there exists a finite dimensional subspace $Q\subset A$ such that: $P\subset Q$, $\operatorname{dim}(Q/P)\geq 2$ and $Q$ is a $P$-module (i.e. a representation of the Lie algebra $P$) via the action $$ p\cdot q : = [p, q] $$ for $p\in P, q\in Q$. Suppose further there exists a $P$-module homomorphism $$\delta:Q\rightarrow P\otimes P$$ such that $\operatorname{ker}(\delta)=P$ (where the $P$-module action on $P\otimes P$ is given by $p\cdot(x\otimes y) =[p,x]\otimes y+x\otimes [p,y]$ for $p, x, y\in P$. If we assume that $P$ is a simple Lie algebra, can we always choose linearly independent elements $z,w \in Q\setminus{P}$ such that the expression \begin{equation}\label{ep} (\delta\otimes\operatorname{id})([\delta(z), 1\otimes w+w\otimes 1] + [1\otimes z+z\otimes 1, \delta(w)]) \end{equation} is non-zero in $A\otimes A\otimes A$? My attempts: For any $z, w\in Q$, write (in shorthand notation with indices omitted) $\delta(z)=\sum z_{1}\otimes z_{2}$ and $\delta(w)=\sum w_{1}\otimes w_{2}$. Then, using the fact that $P$ is the kernel of $\delta$, the above expression simplifies to $$\sum \delta([z_{1}, w])\otimes z_{2} +\delta([z, w_{1}])\otimes w_{2}.$$ Given a $z\in Q\setminus{P}$, since $P$ is simple and $Q/P$ is a $P$-module, we can choose (I think) some $w$ in $Q\setminus{P}$ such that $[z_{1},w]\in Q\setminus P$ for some $z_{1}$ appearing in the expression for $\delta(z)$, but I'm not sure if this helps. Edit: Original motivation for this question comes from Hopf algebras, which is why I've added that tag. 

Sin and exp At the risk of going on too long, I think it's natural to also address a similar question for the sine and exponential functions. Here is the picture for exp: 

In particular, one can see the behavior along the positive real axis matches the description above. (Although there are no axes in this picture, I have verified separately that the transition point in the picture is correct.) Unfortunately, I have no idea how to explain the rest of the picture! Although I have been careful writing the software, I can't say with certainty that the picture is correct anywhere other than the positive real axis. This question is in danger of being too general, so here is one specific question to answer: Is the cardoid-shaped region colored 1 correct? I would, of course, also be happy to hear any other verifications of features in this picture, or other behavior of $P(z)$ not depicted. 

Not an answer, but there is a beautiful instance of such a gluing used by Mazur in his famous Eisenstein ideal paper (page 50) 

Apologies: (as pointed out by Minhyong Kim), the answer below does not address the OP's question $K_p$ is not a number field. It contains a $p$-adic field $Q_p$ and, as such, '$K_p^*$' is not a finitely generated abelian group. 

Sampath and Bondarko have already answered the question. Very interesting in this regard is the important work of Larry Breen, who has computed the ring Ext$^*(G_a, G_a)$ in the category of flat sheaves over a perfect field of positive characteristic; see his paper in Inventiones Math and his paper in IHES. Also a nice tensor category containing that of Dieudonne modules is the category of modules over the Cartier-Dieudonne-Raynaud ring; see Illusie-Raynaud's paper in IHES. Hope this helps. 

Notes on the software The software computes 500 iterates, and then looks at the next 30 iterates. It returns the minimum $n$ such that there are two successive subsequences of length $n$ whose corresponding terms are within $\varepsilon = .001$. If no such $n$ is found, it computes 500 more iterates and tries again. This is repeated 6 times. If no such $n$ is found, the pixel is colored black. Decreasing $\varepsilon$ by a factor of $10^4$ or so takes longer but does not result in a substantially different picture. 

Basic question: Is it correct that the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence is known for $GL_2$ only over $Q_p$ but not other $p$-adic fields? If so, I would like to request some light to be shed on this restriction, i.e., why only $Q_p$ but not its extensions. Any reference for this (and prospects) would be much appreciated. Thanks! 

By using a spectral sequence for the composite functor $T:\Gamma_S (f_*)$ where $f:X \to S$ is the structure morphism and $\Gamma_S$ is the global sections functor on $S$. Duality of the fibers and the base give rise to duality of the terms of the spectral sequence. The main non-formal part is in making the duality map $P: R^iT (-) \times R^jT(-)$ which involves, in particular, knowledge of the dualising object. Once you have $P$, showing that the pairing is non-degenerate etc comes from duality on the terms of the spectral sequence and the five-lemma. The simplest instance of the non-formal part referred to above is as follows: If $$0 \to A \to B \to C\to 0$$ and $$0 \to E \to F \to G \to 0$$ are exact sequences and one has a duality pairing between $A$ and $E$ as well as between $C$ and $G$, one needs to construct a compatible map for $B$ and $F$; that the map induces a duality will follow formally in most situations (finite groups etc). Milne's Arithmetic Duality Theorems should have this. Actually, duality theorems are better stated in the appropriate derived category and so if one is used to derived categories, then Kashiwara-Schapira (Sheaves on manifolds) should be enough to formulate the appropriate theorem. Hope this helps. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ and let $\mathfrak{h}$ be a finite dimensional $k$-Lie algebra. I'm interested in knowing which (Lie algebraic) properties $\mathfrak{h}$ must possess so that $$(\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h})^{\mathfrak{h}}:=\{f\in \wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h}: h\cdot f=0 \forall h\in \mathfrak{h}\}$$ (where $\cdot$ denotes the canonical action of $\mathfrak{h}$ on $\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h}$) contains a $1$-dimensional (possibly trivial) $\mathfrak{h}$-submodule. It is known (proved in, I think, Weibel's ``Introduction to Homological Algebra") that, for any such Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$, $$(\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h})^{\mathfrak{h}}\cong H^{2}(\mathfrak{h})$$ So, we can say a couple of things: If $\mathfrak{h}$ is semisimple, then $H^{2}(\mathfrak{h})=0$ (Whitehead's second Lemma), so $(\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h})^{\mathfrak{h}}=0$. What about a converse (i.e. if $\mathfrak{g}$ finite dimensional Lie algebra and $H^{2}(\mathfrak{g})=0$, what can we say about $\mathfrak{g}?$) If $\mathfrak{h}$ is nilpotent, then the trivial module exists as a $1$-dimensional $\mathfrak{h}$-module of $\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h}$. Does a classification of Lie algebras $\mathfrak{h}$ with 1-dimensional $\mathfrak{h}$-submodules in $(\wedge^{2}\mathfrak{h})$ exist? 

(modified) Historically, Complex Multiplication precedes Class Field Theory and many of the main theorems of CM for elliptic curves were proved directly. See Algebren (3 volumes) by Weber or Cox's book for an exposition. Please also read Birch's article on the beginnings of Heegner points where he points this out explicitly (page three, paragraph beginning "Complex multiplication ...). But not all. so the answer is no (unlike what I had mistakenly presumed at first and the comments below alerted me). The actual history is quite complicated; see Schappacher. 

In response to your first question, there is no Hopf structure on any Sklyanin algebra of any dimension. See Corollary 2.8 (i) of the following paper: $URL$ 

Let $k$ denote an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Suppose $K=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0}K(i)$ is a Hopf $k$-algebra which admits a connected Hopf-grading (that is, a grading which is both an algebra and coalgebra grading, with $K(0)=k$). Call such a Hopf algebra a connected Hopf-graded Hopf algebra. Connected Hopf-graded Hopf $k$-algebras arise naturally in algebraic toplogy when studying the cohomology rings (with coeffecients in $k$) of $H$-spaces. I assume (although I'm not 100% sure), that not all such Hopf algebras arise as cohomology algebras in this way. My question is therefore the following: Let $K$ be a connected Hopf-graded Hopf algebra. Which additional properties on $K$ guarantee that it can be viewed as the cohomology ring $K^{*}(X;k)$ of some $H$-space $X$? 

Motivation Two of my colleagues were discussing the behavior of cos along the positive real axis on our department mailing list. I was curious about the complex behavior, but this is outside my field, so started making pictures like the ones shown here. I've been thinking about these off and on for a little over a year, but not really made any progress or had anyone give me a useful reference. So I wanted to see what the wider MO community has to say. If you want some higher-resolution pictures for cos, see this G+ post: $URL$ 

As indicated by D. Roberts, see the video of Morel's talk at the Abel Conference in honour of Milnor held very recently! Also, see Friedlander's own historical survey! 

one result inspired by Tate's paper is S. Lichtenbaum, On the vanishing of ${\rm Tor}$ in regular local rings. Illinois J. Math. 10 1966 220--226. 

I am not sure if you are still interested in this, one year later. Check out the papers by Yves Andre (see this and this) as well as the articles of Burt Totaro and Laurent Fargues listed in the second. 

Category theory: There is an isomorphism between a vector space and its double-dual which does not depend on choice of basis. It is natural in the sense that every vector space has such an isomorphism, and these isomorphisms commute with every linear transformation. This should be contrasted between the isomorphisms between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual. These depend on a choice of basis and are not natural in this sense. This example constitutes the first two paragraphs of the first paper in category theory! Eilenberg-Mac Lane: General theory of natural equivalences. In Categories for the working mathematician, Mac Lane writes that the purpose of discussing categories is to discuss functors, and that the purpose of discussing functors is to discuss natural transformations.
