Well, Theravada is often argued to hew most closely to the original teachings of the Buddha. See, e.g. "Two Main Schools of Buddhism" for a very brief overview of this. As I understand it, this has much to do with the fact that Theravada is the oldest of the extant Buddhist schools of thought, predating Mahayana by a few centuries. Theravada practice is also more localized to geographic regions nearer the birthplace of Buddhism (that is, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia), and never strayed far from it; this is thought to have contributed to the "orthodoxy" of the school - it mixed less with other intellectual and spiritual traditions. Additionally, Theravada Buddhists draw primarily on the Pali Canon (the Tripitaka), whereas Mahayana Buddhists draw primarily on Chinese sources. These Chinese sources are relatively more distant from the original teachings of the Buddha in terms of both time and language. As a byproduct of this, the Pali texts are often more "authentic".1 That said, the term "Orthodox" has no specific meaning in the context of Buddhism, i.e. there is no such school as "Orthodox Buddhism". There are only lowercase-o "orthodox schools of Buddhism", and what counts as "orthodox" will probably differ depending on who you ask. I should add that pre-sectarian Buddhism is almost definitionally the most "orthodox" school of Buddhist thought. The only problem is that, well, it doesn't exist anymore. 

The one kind of Buddhist text that this does remind me of is the Metta Gatha. By Googling for khama gatha I found some slighty similar texts, for example in this Gatha Book: 

The fact that there is adhamma doesn't mean that dhamma is bad, though, and it does mean you might want to carefully distinguish between dhamma and adhamma. For example, many people would consider the doctrines in the suttas to be "dhamma"; and it's expected that you need to be careful, for example from the Maha-parinibbana Sutta: 

So, "mind" and "thoughts" are two different things, in the same way that "ear" and "sounds" are two different things. But we are conscious of these things making "contact" (e.g. we're conscious of sounds contacting the ear, and conscious of ideas contacting the intellect). Or the theory of the Five Aggregates suggests that mental factors arise as a result of contact between consciousness and form. The Pali words here translated as "intellect & ideas" are mano and dhamma. mano and dhamma appear in the first line of the first verse of the Dhammapada. The commentary suggests that dhamma includes feelings, perceptions, and mental formations (indeed dhamma is a word with many meaning, see for example this short definition and long definition). The commentary also suggests that mind is a necessary precondition for mental factors. 

Some Vedic/Hindu deities are recognized as being part of Buddhist cosmology. For example, Indra, who is the chief god of the Vedic pantheon, is syncretized into Buddhism as Śakra, which is another epithet of his. In Hinduism, the exploits of Indra are described in doctrinal texts like the Vedas and the Puranas, as well as in literary texts like the Mahabharata. But Buddhists (of any school) don't accept these texts as part of their canon, right? So, my question: in what Buddhist (canonical) texts would the doings of syncretized Hindu deities like Indra/Śakra be described? 

1 See, e.g. Rupert Gethin's The Foundations of Buddhism, p. 44: "it is likely that [it] is generally the case [...] that the traditions [the Pali recension] preserves are [...] the oldest and most authentic available to us" (elisions/etc because the original sentence was inverted) 

This closely ties into listening. You can make anything anyone says gold - just because they said it. They said it - it matters enough to them that they said it - it has value. You don't have to like it. You don't have to agree with it. A priori it has value. Humans have value - language is rich with value - what they say matters. Before you can have the opportunity to get into another's world you must acknowledge to yourself (repeatedly) where you don't give a shit about their point of view. It's okay - people proudly defend nonsense all the time. More to the point - it's their point of view - what do you care? Tell the truth about it though. It's quite liberating. Once you are aware that you don't care at all about what another person is saying - you again have access to listening. This may sound contradictory - it's not. When you can tell the truth about what's in the way of you fully being with another - there is nothing more liberating. We catch ourselves in kind of a trap otherwise. We are thrown to only care about ourselves - it's kind of our default way of being. It doesn't look good to only care about ourselves, so we cover it up by pretending to care about others. While pretending to care about others; we are simply incapable of caring for others (it's like pretending to enjoy running while running). Once we can tell the truth (it's not a once and for all thing - it's ongoing) about where we're pretending (mostly just to ourselves - sometimes to others) - then we don't have to pretend anymore. When we don't have to pretend anymore we are free to truly be with other people. When we are free to truly be with other people; we can't help but love them. We see their nastiness and pettiness and we don't consider ourselves superior. We realize we are looking at ourselves - and what they are experiencing is instantly obvious because it is merely a shade of our own experience. When the barriers obstructing our listening disappear - there is no distance between self and other - no difference between speaker and listener - then you don't have to wonder about how to experience their experience - because it's right there. Note: There may come a point where one is always authentically interested and capable of listening and caring about another's experience. I have never caught a glimmer of a persistent state like that. For now it is enough for me to notice where I'm full of it - acknowledge it - and then allow the space for listening to arise. 

... so perhaps not literally "sight", but rather "insight". ("Right View" i.e. samma ditthi isn't mentioned here, but that's another example of the dhamma using a word for sight, i.e. view, in a not-quite literal way -- to mean something like "insight" or something seen or formed by the mind, rather than seen by the eye). 

If your question was meant as proof, I wasn't (logically) convinced by its argument: for example you wrote, "so memory has physical aspect rather than mysterious spiritual aspect", which I doubted, because maybe it has a physical aspect and a mysterious spiritual aspect? Or something else, maybe it has a physical aspect which survives the breakup of the body? The fact that a sight is recorded in a photograph, for example, doesn't mean it can't also be recorded another way as well. Anyway I don't want to argue the topic one way or another: because it seems to me to be examples of various kinds of identity-view, a "thicket of views", of the type we're warned against in suttas like MN 72 and SN 12.15. 

One book I like very much is The Myth Of Freedom by Chogyam Trungpa. Of particular interest is the section where he distinguishes the realms of existence as mental states and ways of being. I've yet to find this discussed elsewhere in any way that resonates. Everything I find merely talks about Buddhism and psychology and speaks about it in terms defined in the latter. Trungpa nourishes the metaphor and generates a rich unanswerable question. Other writings I've found prey on the metaphor and regurgitate a definitive answer. The former offers opening for insight; the latter suppresses thought. Does anyone know of anywhere else this subject is written upon with the type of creativity I've alluded to? 

The tendency is to relate to awareness as a place one resides, get's to, or who one is. Awareness is a fluid state that has no outer boundary, always anchored in the present, infinitely expansive. If you think you are aware, you are not aware. Our awareness is content and context. The content of our awareness varies according to situation, mood, etc. The context of our awareness is the space wherein the content of our awareness lives. The larger and more open the context of our awareness, the richer and more varied is our experience, the greater our intelligence and ability to interact with that which shows up in our field of consciousness. The context of your awareness expands and contracts, and within this context lives what you experience as your self. Edit: To avoid misinterpretation; this isn't to suggest that one shouldn't be mindful at all times. But let's be clear: You can't do that. No one in this forum can. That isn't to say you shouldn't be mindful at all times; but you can't and you won't. But you still should. There is no answer that will suitably provide you with what you need in order to be mindful at all times. If you look at it as a place to get; let me remove all suspense: YOU WILL NEVER GET THERE; however, it is always possible to come from there. I recommend you do that. 

I am agnostic (which can mean, literally, "without knowing") of an even older race's existence. Some (many) people understand the Agañña Sutta to be a "parody", of contemporary Brahmanical texts -- see e.g. this answer, or this answer. There are suttas which mention "no discernible beginning"; and which list "unanswered questions". See also "akalika" -- i.e. the dhamma being timeless, immediate. 

If you're wise you will cherish your "friend in happiness and woe" and (as does a mother her own child) keep them from the harm. Another translation says, instead of "cherish", "attend on them carefully". In other words if someone is your friend then you will cherish them. Not everyone is (defined as) your friend: 

I think not: because "empty" is a characteristic of 'conditioned' phenomena, but nirvana is unconditioned. 

Well that's it isn't it? The answer is in the question. The beauty of the nonsense we tell ourselves is that as we become aware of it, it ceases to have power over us. For example: I suspect that somewhere in the background you are harboring some notion that something will happen when you become sufficiently mindful - enlightement, happiness, perhaps something more subtle. I suspect also that you think (I'm not picking on you - I promise this isn't personal to you) something like 'being mindful is a place you get to, and then you know you are mindful....maybe other people will notice too and treat you accordingly - and once you are there that's kind of it - that's now who you are and things work out nicely after that.' Bad news - It isn't like that at all. Good news - It isn't like that at all. It's good news because there's nowhere to get. Thus, you can't fail. You can't succeed either, but you can master the game (mastery is not an endpoint). Thus the most self-aware / mindful thing to notice is when you are not being mindful. "Huh. I was just lost in my mind for like fifteen minutes." As soon as you notice, you have the opportunity to return your attention to the present, regaining awareness. You go to 'sleep' 2 seconds later - start thinking about your favorite movie - no problem! Notice that you went away - don't make it wrong or scold yourself - just notice - and then come back; ad infinitum. As I said; mindfulness is not the end - it's not even the goal - I sometimes allow myself to flow along with my thoughts for long periods at a time - I like my thoughts. However, mindfulness allows for certain side effects. The side effects of awareness include but are not limited to: 

In Chinese and especially Japanese Buddhism, the statement 天上天下唯我独尊 (Japanese tenjou tenge yui ga dokuson; not sure about the Chinese transliteration), which is typically translated as "On heaven and earth, I alone am honored", is considered to be a well-known statement of the Buddha, spoken when the Buddha first emerged from his mother's womb. The quote is sometimes truncated to just the latter half 唯我独尊 "I alone am honored". I have done a fair bit of searching for a Sanskrit/Prakrit source from which this quote could have been translated into Chinese, but have had no success so far. What text serves as the origin of this quotation? Did it only first appear after the spread of Buddhism into China? 

This is a hugely amateurish question, for which I apologize, but: are Vajrayana and Tibetan Buddhism the same thing? If not, how are they related? In particular, does the term "Tibetan Buddhism" refer to a specific school of Buddhist thought and practice, or does it just generically refer to any sort of Buddhism that is practiced in Tibet? Wikipedia treats the two as separate entities, but some other sources (e.g. this) treat them as effectively the same. 

While on the surface there are more distractions in today's day and age than any other before, there are in fact not any more distractions than there have ever been. While it would appear that what pulls you away from meditation is , these are not what pull you away. What will always pull you away, and what has always pulled any human away is the stream of incessant chatter that you hear when you sit down and close your eyes. There is nothing in the external world that is capable of causing distraction by itself. There are stories of Zen Monks who did not stir from Zazen as an earthquake struck. Distractions happen internally; not externally. I'm going to limit the scope of my answer to a specific kind of meditation - the kind of meditation where you sit and focus - but for the record, meditation is in no way limited to that one definition. Meditation is available always; independent of circumstances. For now, what would be powerful, I think, is if you really tell the truth to yourself about some things. First - I don't know anything about your circumstances; but I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that time is not the issue. If you really confront how many hours you have in a day, and what it is that you are doing during each of those hours; I would be shocked if there were not 20 minutes you could claim for uninterrupted meditation time. Most people live their lives in a haze of abstractions and stories about reality. Few people live their lives grounded in reality. In reality, you can only ever do the thing you are doing when you are doing it; and whatever that thing is doesn't take a long time or a short time - it takes some specific relatively predictable amount of time. In our stories, "I have too much to do", "I never have enough time" , etc. In reality, quoting Werner Erhard: 

In summary I suggest you avoid "demonizing" people and their activities. Here for example is a (non-Buddhist) set of mottos which helped to guide preschool teachers: Children Learn What They Live 

There's a book titled In the Buddha's Words which people recommend as an introductory text. Anyway that book has, amongst other things, this to say, 

Looking at your example I suppose that "being thirsty" might be a craving to live, "wanting a new car" might be craving a sense-object, and "wanting your loved one" might be craving to be separated from a painful feeling of not being with them. 

Very young children are said to go through (i.e. become capable of) different developmental stages as they get older, including: 

A belief in rebirth (even Karma) isn't especially on this list. I think I agree that the above are essential: that the historical Buddha talked about them, and that they're a necessary part of Buddhist belief. I agree that tales of rebirth and of other lives feature in some Buddhist literature, e.g. Mahayana literature seems to have the Buddha being reborn. I don't know a lot about Buddhism so, please, if you answer with a paraphrase of scripture, please include the name of the scripture you're quoting so that I could look it up.
