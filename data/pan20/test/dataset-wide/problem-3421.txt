Your method and numerical calculations are correct. Then, it is a well-known fact that Cobb-Douglas (i.e exponential with constant returns to scale) production functions with price-taking behavior lead to linear cost functions, i.e. to constant marginal cost and equal to average cost, and linear profit functions, which means that profits in the long run will be either zero or infinite: If price is above $2$ ($=MC=AC$) each firm would want to produce an infinite amount of output. if it is equal to $2$, firms that produce will make zero profits. If it is below $2$ no firm will produce and profits will again be zero. At market level, the assumption of perfect competition (costless entry especially) in turn implies that the long-run (no fixed costs) market supply curve will be horizontal at $P=MC=AC$, and the level of output will be determined by the demand curve and consumer preferences. The output per firm and hence the number of firms remains undetermined here. 

The economic essence of saddle-path stability, is that it requires conscious behavior and decision making from the part of economic agents, in order for the system to remain on the saddle path. Simply put, we cannot do "whatever we like" and still expect the system to settle down. But that is what makes it interesting (and true to reality): on their own, economic systems are unstable. Contrast this with the basic Solow growth model: there, fixing arbitrarily the savings rate (i.e. depriving ourselves from making a decision on it period per period) makes the system properly stable. But once we want to optimize with respect to the savings rate, we find out that there is a single path that leads to long-term equilibrium. Now, perusing the pages of a book like Barro and Sala-i-Martin's "Economic Growth", which contains many-many extensions of the basic RCK growth model, one will not find a model with intertemporally optimizing agents that is also mathematically stable. ADDEDNDUM Elaborating, in response to a thoughtful comment by the OP, my approach to the issue of "stability" of an economy is the following: The fact that economies tend to "correct course" is not an indication, let alone proof, that they posses some inherent stabilization mechanism independent of the purposeful action of the economic agents. If this was the case, then indeed, we should have models that possessed the mathematical property of stability (I remind again that "saddle-path stable" although it uses the word "stable", is a mathematically unstable system). On the other hand, economies do not plunge into chaos every day. The solution to the puzzle from my point of view is not that we "continuously fine tune the economy" -such dreams and visions have been tried and squashed (irrespective of what ideological/philosophical (dis) agreements one may have with socialism, the factual lesson to be learned from the failure of centrally planned economies is that an economy is such a complex system that no one can "plan and then fine-tune it", especially in our era). My answer is that economies, after being hit by external shocks or internal institutional failures or technology upheavals, or.., tend to return to a dynamic path that tends to some fixed point by the aggregate consequences of decentralized purposeful action of economic agents that try not to fix the economy as a whole, but their own economic present and future. Economies survive not "because they inherently do", not because the government is "steering the boat with a certain and effective hand", but because individuals try hard every day to survive. And the RCK models reflect just that: if one performs comparative statics on it, assuming an external shock that suddenly puts the economy out of the saddle-path, the prediction of the model as to what will happen in order for the economy to return to the (new) saddle path towards the (new) long-run equilibrium, is more or less what we observe in reality. But this happens not because the government makes it so, but because individual economic agents realize that they must do so in order not to eventually self-destruct. I will indulge myself and I will link to a little exposition I crafted a year ago for a class of graduate students, to show them how the simplest RCK model can help them think about the economic crisis (and subsequent depression) in Greece -which was sudden enough to be described as a shock. The exposition can be found here. 

In general, no. Since $q= f(L,K)$ is a multivariable, single-valued function, then by the implicit function theorem applied on the implied equation $H = f(L,K)-q=0$, what we can say is only that $$\frac {\partial L}{\partial q} = -\frac {\partial H/\partial q}{\partial H /\partial L} = -\frac {-1}{MP_L} = \frac {1}{\partial q /\partial L}$$ Essentially, here we treat $q$ as a univariate function (by taking partial derivatives, we keep all other variables fixed). But total derivatives are another matter. For $q = f(L,K)$, we have the implicit relation $L = L(q,K)$ and so by taking the total differential and divide throughout by $dq$ we get $$\frac {d L(q,K)}{d q} = \frac {\partial L(q,K)}{\partial q} + \frac {\partial L(q,K)}{\partial K}\frac {dK}{dq}$$ But $\frac {\partial L}{\partial K} \neq 0$, because we implicitly keep $q$ constant in order to calculate this partial derivative, and so by changing $K$ we have also to change $L$. The other possibility would be that $dK/dq$ is zero. If we do not have such a production function (or we are not in a range where such a thing holds), we obtain $$\frac {dL}{dq} \neq \frac {\partial L}{\partial q} = \frac {1}{\partial q/\partial L}$$ 

A recently published (and perhaps the only one) paper on the matter is Lloyd, P. (2012). The Discovery of the Isoquant. History of Political Economy, 44(4), 643-661. From the Introduction : 

$$\frac {\Delta d_{t+1}}{d_t} = \frac {\frac {D_{t+1}}{Y_{t+1}}-\frac {D_{t}}{Y_{t}}}{\frac {D_{t}}{Y_{t}}} = \frac {D_{t+1}Y_{t}-D_{t}Y_{t+1}}{D_{t}Y_{t+1}}$$ $$=\frac {D_{t+1}Y_{t}}{{D_{t}Y_{t+1}}}-1 = \frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t+1}}\cdot \left[{\frac {D_{t+1}}{D_{t}} -\frac {Y_{t+1}}{{Y_{t}}}}\right]$$ $$=\frac{Y_{t}}{Y_{t+1}}\cdot \left[{\frac {\Delta D_{t+1}}{D_{t}} -\frac {\Delta Y_{t+1}}{{Y_{t}}}}\right]$$ So the "rule of thumb" deviates from the above exact expression by (multiplicatively) $Y_{t}/Y_{t+1}$. Now, we are talking about the growth rate of the Debt/GDP ratio. Say the ratio was $120\text{%}$ and it went to what? in one year? Say it went to $D_{t+1} /Y_{t+1} = 130\text{%}$. Then its exact growth rate is $130/120 -1 = 8.33\text{%}$ Assume also that GDP grew at 5% yearly rate, so $Y_{t}/Y_{t+1} = 0.95238$. In this numerical example, the "rule of thumb will give as Debt/GDP ratio growth rate $8.33\text{%} \times 0.95238 = 7.933 \text{%}$, or less than half percentage point underestimation. This is considered a small inaccuracy in the real world, when one discusses broadly these magnitudes. And in general the above numerical example exaggerates, in most cases the growth rate of the GDP and of the Debt/GDP ratio are smaller than above, so the inaccuracy will be even smaller. Hence, the "rule of thumb" becomes acceptable in general also in theoretical models. 

The trick is to put minus and plus infinity side-by-side on top, and imagine straight lines rotating following the arrows. So when we deal with negative slopes "flatter slope" = higher algebraic value, lower value in absolute terms (closer to zero), "steeper slope" = lower algebraic value, higher value in absolute terms. 

These kinds of questions would be manageable and in principle interesting and answerable, but I personally am not aware of any such study. 

In Yongsung Chang, Sun-Bin Kim, Frank Schorfheide (2010), NBER paper the authors use the exact same utility function and they write (p.9) 

"Loan waiving" means "loan write-off": the debt is eliminated. Therefore it is subtracted from the assets of the lender, and if it was already a non-performing loan (asset for the lender), the total of non-performing assets is now reduced. The value of the debt that has been wrtten-off appears as a once-off "loss" in the Profit & Loss statement of the lender. Whether debt write-off is or is not "a good idea" has no single/simple answer, and it depends on a lot of factors that may change in time and country. The main abstarct arguments against is that a) writing-off debt signals to other borrowers that they can too leave their debts unserviced on purpose, even though they are financially able to service them, in expectation of a future new write-off: in other words, it creates what is called "moral hazard", b) seeing debts being written off, lenders will be less willing to lend funds in the future, even to prospective borrowers in good financial standing. c) finally a pure economics agument, says that businesses that cannot repay their loans are inefficient businesses and so it is not in the economy's best interest to "provide a lease of life" through debt write-off to such inefficient entities. Again, the above are the abstarct arguments. The OP has a specific situation in mind, and a specific study should be carried out to evaluate and quantify the socio-economic pros and cons of debt write-off for the specific case. 

The main property of trig functions is their cyclicality. Then one would think that they could be ideal in time series analysis, to model "fluctuations around a trend". I believe that the reasons they are not actually used in such a setting are 1) They are deterministic functions, so they do not allow for fluctuations to be stochastic 2) If the researcher wants to create a model that produces up and down fluctuations (oscillations) around a trend, he would want to obtain that property from the behavioral and other assumptions of the model. If he were to use a trig function, he would a priori impose on the model the sought theoretical outcome. Instead, one opts for difference-differential equations. There we obtain oscillations (damped or not) if some characteristic roots are complex -and then the trig functions appear, but as an alternative representation, not as buidling blocks. 

World population currently is estimated at $7.3$ billion people, while world GDP at $74.5$ trillion USD (nominal). So the global average of per capita GDP currently stands at USD $10,205$, again nominal, not adjusted for purchasing-power-parity. But in any case, this number, although not negligible, it is small enough so that, even if we had absolute global equidistribution, we would hardly be in an "Affluent Society". This alone could justify why Growth is still the main economic target of societies all over the world: even if inequality was out of the picture, we will still be far from living really "comfortably". Add inequality to the picture, and one realizes that Growth is also seen as something that can help mitigate possible social tensions due to inequality: one accepts the existence of inequality easier, if ones sees his own fortunes getting better (this requires of course that everybody gets something out of Growth, even in unequal shares). 

The other answers covered the main issues, I would like to respond to the "Edit" made by the OP in the question: 

Let's try the Fermi estimate. In a two-period set up (each lasting something like 25 years in calendar time), let the intertemporal budget constraints be $$a_2 =(1+r)a_1 + w_1 - c_1$$ $$c_2 = (1-b)a_2 +p_2, \;\;\; 0<b<1$$ where $a$ is assets, $w$ is wage income $c$ is consumption, $p$ is pension, and $b$ is bequest as a percentage of assets. Assume that $a$ is i government bonds. Note that old people eat up their wealth : i.e. they collect back also the principal from the government (fully if $b=0$). This does not mean that government debt is extinguished, it just means that it changes hands. Assume that the young person does not plan on making any more savings or dissavings, so $w_1 = c_1$, and it lets his current assets accumulate. Also assume that $b=0$: if we are talking about low and middle-income persons, this is not very unrealistic reality since we are talking strictly about assets in the form of government bonds. Consider now wiping out the debt: it means that consumption when old will tend to go down by $a_2$. In order for the envisioned increased economic growth to "take care of pensions" we must have at least that the initial $p_2$ will increase by $a_2$. As calculated here, "nearly half of the debt is held in trust for retirement". Say $9$ trillion USD. Assume that the current real-interest rate on US bonds is $0.5$%. Compounded over $25$ years we get $1+r = 1.13$. So if we wipe out the debt related to pensions, we must guarantee to the future old generation an additional $~10$ trillion USD in pensions (in real terms). Current US GDP is $18$ trillion USD and it increases by $2.2$%. This will lead to $31$ trillion in $25$ years time. But we want that to increase by another $~10$ trillion at least, and assuming that all will be given for pensions. So we need GDP to reach in $25$ years $41$ trillion USD. For this to happen we need an average growth rate over the period not of $2.2$% but of $3.35$%. That's $1.15$ percentage points higher growth or more than $50$% higher average growth than today. So our Fermi estimate led us to ask: Can eliminating 9 trillion in Federal debt held for retirement purposes lead to an increase of the average growth for the next 25 years by $1.15$ percentage points? Then in order to answer this question we must ask "how eliminating government debt will lead to increased growth" irrespective of how much. I obviously ignore issues of uncertainty, property rights, and the like.
