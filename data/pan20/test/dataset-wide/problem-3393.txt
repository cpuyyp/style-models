The appropriateness of a response derives from the context in which it is asked. If the context is a math class, then appeal to the formal definition of a curve would be appropriate and appeal to color would not be. If you were at a paint store, the opposite would be the case. Answering with a color answer in a math class would be literally true but also overly literal. Nevertheless, it is not totally inappropriate in a math class, since precision and explicitness are desiderata in mathematics, and asking "What is the difference..." is really a poor question, since one can refine the question without giving away the answer. One can omit the color difference, which is just a distractor. One can answer that one is blue and the other is orange, but I don't think one can formally answer that way: but the question does not require you to answer formally. 

The classic original study is Joseph Greenberg 1950 "The Patterning of Root Morphemes in Semitic" (Word 5, 162–181). A later study with a larger lexicon was conducted by M. Mrayati 1987 "Statistical studies of Arabic language roots". The OCP controversy features this pattern prominently. There are different degrees of strength to the particular effects, for example as far as I know, in a triconsonantal root there are no roots with s and z (either order) as C2 and C3. The overall picture is that if you just look at the frequency of certain phonemes in the lexicon of roots, you find that m occurs a certain number of times, likewise b, n, k... but when you looc at co-ocurrrence (b plus k vs. b plus m), there is a decreased likelihood of finding b and m together in a root. The effect that has been of interest to theorists is the treatment of absolutely identical consonants (where the limits are extremely strong) and homorganic consonants. Greenberg spells out the facts in great detail. 

You are presumably hearing it right. "Something" is different from "rotten" in more than place of articulation: "rotten" = [rɑʔn̩]. "Something", in that pronunciation, is [sʌmʔm̩] (traditionally that vowel is transcribed with wedge unless it's in an unstressed syllable). Syllabicity is not a phonetic "fact" that can be decided by listening, so I included the syllabicity diacritic on phonological grounds. But transcriptions can be more phonologically-inspired, so if you have a reason to think that the glottal plus nasal is one segment, you can call it a glottalised nasal, yielding [sʌmm̰] and [rɑn̰]. A third option is simply [sʌmm̩] where the glottal closure you be be relegated to a phonetic detail rule. If the point is to be clear about that pronunciation, go with [sʌmʔm̩]. [Addendum]Putting an even finer point on it, you might contemplate [sʌ̃ʔm] vs. [rɑʔn], with or without syllabicity. The question is when the lips start to close, so a later closure would point to this transcription. You can't get even a near-minimal pair with labials, since in Standard English a.k.a. my dialect 'rotten-glottalization' only applies to /t/. But there are analogous examples with alveolar, such as "cotton" [kɑʔn̩] and "Canton" (Ohio, not China) [kænʔn̩], and in the latter I think [kæ̃ʔn̩] is credible. Needless to say, claims about phonetic outputs require phonetic method to verify. In light of Greg Lee's observation and focusing on the word "simultaneous", [p'] would not really be appropriate unless the stop also becomes oral. There are speakers of American English who are aggressive glottalizers and you get [slæp'm̩] for "slap 'em"; the question is whether the thing that you're talking about sounds like that. In the [sʌmʔm̩] version, glottal closure may be initiated at the point of labial closure, but would not reach full closure. Phonetic simultaneity is actually gradient, and the supposedly "simultaneous" labial and velar closures of [kp] are not truly simultaneous, thus we would like to see just how simultaneous the closures are -- it's not really a matter for introspection, it requires measurement. Also, one must be careful about equating glottal approximation with full and sustained glottal closure. Very frequently, supposed glottal stops are lenited to glottalization in inter-sonorant context. 

It is not clear that the idea can be rigorously tested, in part because "complexity" can refer to at least three different things, and in part because there's a big sampling problem in checking if there is such a correlation. The worst possible way to try to answer the question is via cherry-picked languages evaluated subjectively. Chinese is obviously really simply morphologicially and it has a huge number of speakers, and Lushootseed is really complex morphologically, and it has very few speakers (none, in fact). You could start by generating a random sample of let's say 100 languages, and check the facts, but I've engaged in that game before and it turns out that the biggest problem is getting an answer for most of those languages – in my most recent 100-language sample, only 5 languages have over a million speakers (Xiang Chinese, Southern Azerbaijani, Western Farsi, Sylheti, Georgian), and probably less that 20% of them have sufficient descriptive material that you have a prospect of saying how complex the language's morphology is. Since there are huge numbers of tiny languages and many well-populated dialects of Chinese, it's not clear to me what an unbiased sample would be. One kind of complexity is "number of affixes", so if a language has just one affix slot and 200 affixes that could go there, that would be kind of complex, though mostly trivial. A second kind of complexity involves numbers of slots, so that most Indo-European languages would not be very complex since there are relatively few slots for affixes. The final and IMO best metric is in terms of the system of rules, for example if you get suppletive portmanteaux of slot1a+slot2d, or if there are morphological conditions on affixation (such as "add X only on perfective verbs"). While I think that gets at real complexity, I don't see how we can count (and if we can't count, we can't numerically correlate, and thus we're back to subjective judgments like "Turkish is complex" or "Kalaallisut is complex". Still, I think it is probably true, based on subjective experience. 

The main cause of uniformity in given names is religion. Many Muslims are named Mohamed (and spelling variants) and many Christians are names Mary for obvious reasons. Forces of linguistic change give rise to local variants like John, Jean [ʒɛ̃], Sean, Shawn, Johann, Ivan. When you say that common for people to name the same name, that means you can take all the given names and count up the number of people with that name, and rank then in order of frequency. If there is a small set of culturally-available names like John, Ali, Ram, then you expect most names to be drawn from that set. There are cultures where children are given names meaning e.g. "(death) doesn't know you", but the chances of many (i.e. millions of) people picking Tilumanya as a given name is nil. Religion has been the most influential source of this cultural uniformity. 

Without a list, we can't be sure how narrowly you want the explanation to be tailored. What I think you're talking about is probably universal in language, and isn't a feature of language per se, it's a cultural one, manifested in language. Farting is deemed to be socially negative, so the term "fart" is one of those dis-preferred words, and instead to use some euphemistic replacement, like "poot" (but that's child language) or "flatulate" (rather medical sounding), or "pass gas". There are numerous other examples referring to body parts and actions, also ethnicity. What's on the list and which list it's on varies over time, as does the most likely referent, for example "breast" was for a while a less-polite term. Ethnic terms seem to be particular volatile, no doubt because the underlying social issues change rapidly. The same phenomenon exists is every language that I know of. For example, in Logoori polite speech in the presence of elders, you should use the verb "breathe" to refer to farting; the singular of "buttock" (cheeks) is used to refer to the anus; there are various insulting ethnic terms which of course you don't use in the presence of members of that ethnicity (words which meant things like "foreigner", "mud-person", "bush savage", "despised"). On the other pole of word-tabooing, a number of languages have special rules about men saying words that contain sounds from their mother in law's name, such as "hlonipha" in Nguni society. In Javanese, there are at least three speech registers, depending on one's relationship to the interlocutor, which involves different lexical items and different grammatical constructions. The simplest albeit most risky way to determine that there really are such conventions is to try violating the apparent conventions, and see what the effect is. 

This set of historical changes define the development of Germanic from Indo-European. The same set of rules could somewhat-accidentally also exist in some other language family -- in fact, the same processes applied historically to two different sub-branches of Bantu, the Sotho-Tswana languages and the Luhya languages. They talk about the change as the "Luhya Law", and the similarity to Grimm's Law has been commented on. These are completely different historical events, separated in time by millenia and in space by over 3,000 miles. It is not clear what caused these changes to take place, so we can't really say whether they have the same underlying cause. It is not even established that Grimm's Law is one single change, rather than being two (or more) separate changes that happened to coincide in Germanic. 

There was a feeling at the time that the distance between underlying and surface forms in their analysis was too great, and there must be some absolute limit on how different the two levels of representation could be (say, measured in number of features changed, or whether underlying feature matrices or sequences of matrices had to be a subset of observed matrices). The attempt to articulate any such formal restrictions was quite unsuccessful. With a bit more rational analysis, we came to understand that the issue was not really about the qualitative distance between representations (a.k.a. abstractness), but rather it was about other methodological assumptions that SPE made. The primary factors that motivated their abstract analysis were (a) their aesthetic desire for symmetry, (b) the wish to formally connect all possibly related word forms, and (c) the desire (prevalent at the time) to capture every generalization out there, even ones that deserve to roam free. Since their formal theory of rules was extremely device-rich, a lot of things would be possible then, that were deemed to be formally impossible in later developments of phonology. (Note how I say nothing about the current state...). For instance, they wanted to assume that various and variety have a common root, which led them to a certain abstract analysis of the i ~ ai alternation, and similar facts drawn from word pairs like derive ~ derivative and the ɪ ~ ai alternation led to them positing underlying forms that reflect Chaucerian pronunciation. Then they conclude that the English vowel system really has no underlying diphthongs, except for ɔi, so that makes way for a symmetry argument that "coin" has to be underlyingly /kœ:n/ (because of the rules they set up, that derivation comes essentially for free, and now there are no diphthongs). SPE was an integrated package deal, and great effort was put into accounting for every little fact without having any exceptions, thus a stress puzzle could force a different and more abstract analysis of [ow] (veto ← /ve:tɔ/, motto ← /mɔto/). In their analysis, [ˈraitʃəs] 'righteous' derives from /rixt-i-ɔs/ and [dʒəˈræf] 'giraffe' from /giræffe/, and so on. Oddly and uncharacteristically, they also note 2 pages later (p. 152) that "giraffe" could also come from /ǰVrāf/ which is only two steps away from saying that the surface form is the same as the underlying form. The general reaction was that there was something wrong, and "abstractness" was blamed. My position is that blame should be placed not on abstractness, but on gratuitous assumptions about morphology esp. the question of whether historically related forms are to be reduced to common roots and affixes in all cases; on their idealizing assumptions about underlying representations; and on the fact that they were trying to operate without an autonomous theory of acquisition (that is, the structure of grammatical theory was supposed to automatically account for all of acquisition). 

Arabic, spoken in one of the hottest countries on the planet, is far more guttural than Finnish (which nobody would consider "guttural"). There could be a correlation between climate and phonetic typology, but it would be coincidental. The phonetic properties of a language today are heavily influenced by the properties of its ancestor millenia ago -- Arabic has a lot of gutturals because proto-Semitic did as well. And proto-Semitic probably inherited gutturals from proto-Afro-Asiatic. This relates to geography because that ancestor language was spoken in a relatively small area in Northeast Africa, where it is generally not cold. In the modern era, one can easily move across the globe in a few days (I'm being realistic about airplane connections and border crossings), but in the pre-technological era, people tended to stay put for generations. To the point that Khoisan speakers in southern Africa have probably been there for tens of thousands of years. So for humans, climate is irrelevant to language, and what matters is population movement patterns and contact between typologically-different languages. If this world is populated by non-humanoids who e.g. communicate (sometime) by blowing bubbles in water, then a different mode of communication such as belching fire might be necessary if the setting is Pluto. 

I understand your question as asking about tone-collocations on syllables which contain at least three pitch-height elements. I do not understand your basis for excluding Yoruba. One reason might be that underlyingly Yoruba has just H M L, and contours result from rules; but the other is that rise and fall in Yoruba clearly decompose into H and L on a single syllable. So it is unclear whether you are excluding languages with superficial contours, or those where contours are arguably not "atomic" (as Chinese is sometimes analyzed). I will assume that you are only excluding superficial contours. In which case, Mandarin 3rd tone can't be argued to be a complex (tri-tonal) contour. And finally, "tone" is often used to describe the tone profile of entire words so that HLH might be a pattern in a disyllabic word (high+rise), and could be called "a tone". Such an analysis would be irrelevant, under the understanding that you're looking for tone density within a single syllable. If these assumptions aren't what you had in mind, you should edit the question to clarify. The main result is that tri-tonal contours are much less common than bi-tonal contours, in fact very few languages have non-superficial tritonal contours. In no language do you find tri-tonal contours without there being bi-tonal contours. The number of allowed tri-tonal contours is always less than the number of bi-tonal contours. Tritonal contours always seem to involve a change in pitch-movement direction (relevant in a language with 3+ levels), so LML or MHL might be possible but not LMH contrasting with LH. However, if you suspend the consideration of non-superficiality and map phonetic pitch traces to "tones", tritonal contours become more common, possibly more common that bitonal contours, given a fine-enough grained analysis of surface pitch.
