I think the best way to figure out "why" a construction has to be a certain way is to see how it got to be that way, or whether it is usual or not for a language to do things this way. There are three issues: 

since it is just evaluating the surface sequence [i i j]. However, a generalized OCP, as proposed by Suzuki (1998:64) can distinguish between the two. Here is Suzuki's formulation: 

There are two head-dependent relations in this sentence. One is the relationship between the verb (a head), 'uns-...' and its arguments (dependents), 'Bold' and 'naiz ohin-...-oo'. The other is between a possessor noun (dependent), 'Bold' and the possessed noun (head), 'naiz ohin-...'. In both cases, the relationship is marked on the dependent; Accusative case is marked on the object noun, and possessive is marked on the possessed noun, the two of which happen to be the same thing. 

For the English example, it will be harder to pull this kind of analysis off with the example you have chosen, because the semantics aren't very regular. The Tagalog example works because any noun can predicate and the meaning is "to be a N." It is hard to think of other nouns that could be analyzed like your permit example in English, where the noun predicates and takes a subject, an object and an infinitival complement. On the other hand, you might be able to analyze in this way a kind of aversive construction where just about any noun acts as a transitive verb, e.g., 

It looks like you are interested in the transphonologization of phonemic contrasts. There is a nice downloadable paper (Hyman 2008) dealing with the topic in an accessible way which includes multiple examples and plenty of references for further reading. 

The third method is rarely done in a strictly controlled way because of the difficulty in measuring auditory properties precisely. It is, however, used informally by phoneticians with a trained ear. Ladefoged has claimed that many phoneticians claiming to use the Cardinal Vowel method were actually using a sort of auditory based method (most likely because it is actually difficult for anyone to feel the position of their tongue body): 

Examples of all four types of vowel plots can be found in Lindau (1978). The first method has been used in the past with varying methods which would be considered too invasive by today's standards (x-ray motion pictures, placing gold or lead chains, buttons on the tongue, etc.). Modern techniques such as ultrasound or MRI are still used in well-equipped phonetics laboratories, but on whole method (1) is not practical for ordinary descriptions. Method (2), called the "Cardinal Vowel" method, is a bit curious in historical perspective: it requires a phonetician trained in the method to repeat a vowel sound uttered by a native consultant until the phonetician's imitation is nearly perfect, and then to proprioceptively assess his/her tongue position in articulating the vowel (Abercrombie, 1991: 40). What is interesting about this method is that in order to use it you would have to be personally trained by the late Daniel Jones or by one of his students, and this is why it has more or less died out. But to get an idea of how it went, consider a typical description of some vowels in Tswana written by Daniel Jones: 

The English translation contains a relative clause, but there is no kind of subordinate marking in the Nahuatl version. A more or less literal translation will be: "[They] are called. They are priests. Their names are Quaquacuiltin. They are summoned." The verbs can appear by themselves and be a full clause. So can the nouns. The particle I've glossed "the" is itself optional. There is just not much "glue" holding the words of the sentence together. I can't think of a very reason why dependent clauses in head-marking languages should lack particles which mark them as dependents. A not too thoughtful reason is that since dependents at the sub-clause level receive no marking (that is what makes it a head-marking language) the same phenomenon just applies to dependents at the clause- and higher level. It could be on the other hand that clause subordination is a language specific issue that does not fully apply to head-marking languages. I'll conclude with two quotes: Nichols (1986: 114) [this paper is worth reading in its entirety if you haven't already] 

Possibly relevant is the paper by de Pauw and de Schriver (2008) where they test an automated parser, using the the 12.5 million word Helsinki Corpus of Swahili. That corpus, as it turns out, is lemmatized, so if you gain access to it as a "university researcher" and you can do some basic scripting, you will be able to generate this list yourself. 

How does a verb meaning "to possess" develop a meaning where it expresses obligation Why does the following verb of the embedded clause appear in the infinitive? Why is que rather than de or something else used as a subordinator? 

First, concerning how some of these data will be analyzed in OT. In "classical" OT, markedness constraints were only evaluated on surface representations, and faithfulness constraints were only evaluated on pairs of input/output representations. As it turns out, the analysis of reduplication is one area that led to the development of different types of faithfulness constraints. Correspondence Theory (McCarthy & Prince 1995) generalizes the notion of faithfulness constraints, so that they can apply to other types of pairing, including Base/Reduplicant. In Alderete et al (1999) you can find a discussion of how IO and BR faithfulness constraints can interact to account for differing phonotactic characteristics in Reduplicants versus in other parts of the language. I suppose the key to handling the examples you have provided is to note that Faith(BR) compares either the Underlying Representation of the base or the surface Representation of the base with the surface form of the reduplicant (thanks to @Aerlinthe for pointing this out). In the Manam examples Faith(UR of base/Reduplicant) would be outranked by a gemeral markedness constraint banning non-homorganic nasal-obstruent sequences. This doesn't appear to be a real problem for OT. Tellingly, in Urbanczyk's (2007) chapter on Reduplication, she discusses the Manam data but doesn't bother to remark on the nasal assimilation in the base. Now to the main part of the question: are there processes which tend towards being surface true? Probably the more fruitful way of asking the question is: which types of processes will tend to result in opacity? (you will get more hits if you search for opacity in google) When you have opacity, there are two interacting processes, such that one of them covers up the conditioning environment of the other (see Bakovic 2011's citation of Kiparsky 1973 (which is notoriously difficult to find) for a clearer definition). If one of these was nasal place assimilation, then we would find rule-conditioned homorganic nasal-obstruent sequences alongside non-homorganic nasal-obstruent sequences. This situation is probably rare because it just happens to be difficult to produce a nonhomorganic nasal-obstruent sequence. A process like vowel harmony, on the other hand, is different, since it is not especially difficult to produce, say, a [+ATR] vowel and a [-ATR] vowel in consecutive syllables (see Archangeli & Pulleyblank 2007 for discussion of some examples of opacity in vowel harmony. There would be no strong articulatory pressure against an opaque rule interaction involving vowel harmony like there would with nasal place assimilation. I think that your initial intuition is correct: by "surfacy" you mean strongly motivated by non-mentalistic physical factors (articulatory, aerodynamic, acoustic). While most phonological rules have some kind of physical basis, some rules have a stronger basis than others. 

In parts of the world very dense in languages (e.g. Nigeria, India, Papua New Guinea), a common scenario is this: a child's mother speaks language A, the father speaks language B, a vehicular language C is frequently used for interactions between people from different villages, especially in cities, and language D is an official language which is the medium of instruction in government schools. In such places it is not at all uncommon for a young adult to be fluent in four languages. For concreteness, imagine an Indian child whose mother is Tamil and whose father is Telugu. The child speaks these languages within his/her extended family. Hindi is used when going out into town to do business, and English is used in school. 

It is interesting data. Not knowing anything about Georgian, I am guessing from your summary that the uses you quote have to do with the second use "adds direction or other nuance." There are some languages (Toqabaqita, for example) which have no basic verb meaning "come," but combine a verb meaning "move" with directional particles to get things translatable as "come" or "go". 

Communities should have the right to choose the fate of their languages. In some cases, the best policy for a young country, to produce national unity, is to discourage multilingualism, since it is thought to reinforce tribalism. Cultural diversity does not necessarily require that different languages be spoken. 

You might enjoy a 2005 web publication by Johanna Nichols, which discusses what one can expect to learn about a language, given the size of the available corpus. In my particular experience, the most efficient situation is where one has a fair-sized text corpus along with follow-up elicitation based on patterns encountered in the text. Having a purely text-based corpus makes the number of words required considerably larger. For one project I've worked on, with a ~280,000 word corpus with free translations and no supporting materials, myself and my colleagues could cover all of the basic topics in a grammatical description. A current project has a corpus of ~35,000 words with extensive notes from follow-up elicitation, and I'd consider the potential coverage better, but not by much, than for the language with the larger corpus. 

Knowledge of a language identifies one with a constituency speaking that language. Immigrants to a new place can usually gain more than a modicum of acceptance in the host community if they are able to speak the host language fluently. Someone might feel more at home within the community of Star Trek enthusiasts than, say, the community of Inuits. I am also quite confident that the average person will receive more encouragement from the Star Trek enthusiast community than from the community of Inuit speakers if they are taking up a new language spoken by that community. 

You are probably thinking of the section "Acoustic analysis of Vowels" in the chapter called "Acoustic Phonetics" (pp.170--1 in the 4th ed. of "A course in Phonetics"). Here are the tricks Ladefoged discusses 

So if you are starting from your rewrite rules, you could either start from S -> NP VP or S -> S Coord S, then you would get two different bracketings of your phrase markers and still manage to insert all of the same words in the same order once you get to lexical insertion. 

I choose /ki/, which is a noun class prefix in a good hundred Bantu languages. It also means "key" in English, "key" in Langalanga, "who" in French, "give" in Ngwe. 

You would like to find an analysis where, in the first sentence, permit "fits the syntactic category of being a noun, but is occupying the syntactic slot of a verb." Commenters are for good reason thinking you are talking about zero-derivation. To take it from a neutral perspective, we can assume that the analysis you are interested in is diagrammed roughly as follows. 

In Heine and Kuteva's (2002) World Lexicon of Grammaticalization you'll find examples of words with lexical meanings "give, leave, arrive" having grammaticalized into morphemes expressing dative, ablative, and allative meanings, respectively. However, what is documented are cases of words with lexical meanings gradually changing into words which are best treated as adpositions. When you are thinking of case systems, you are probably interested in cases where a language gains a nominal affix used to express a case relation. Here, the most likely historical change is where a word which already has case-like meaning (viz. an adposition) fuses to the noun. See Lehmann (2002: 70ff.) "Thoughts on Grammaticalization" for examples. 

Most languages have some kind of word-accentual system, where one position in each word is more prominent than other positions in the same word. The prominent position(s) may have some or all of these properties: higher pitch, longer duration, greater number of contrasts, louder or more forceful pronunciation. When the final property applies, the language is usually said to have stress accent. In these cases the most prominent position is said to have primary stress, and other positions may have secondary stress if they are more prominent than the least prominent syllable, but less prominent than the most prominent syllable. When studying the word-accent system of a language, you would like to be able to predict which syllable has primary stress, and which if any have secondary stress, and this often involves counting some number of syllables from the edge of a word. In Polish, for example, you count from the end of the word and then stress (in most words) falls on the penultimate syllable. But there are some languages where the counting is complicated by the fact that some syllables (especially syllables with a long vowel or a coda) seem to "count as two" for the purpose of assigning primary and secondary accent. So that your analysis can still be simple and easy to follow, you just invent a new type of timing unit, the mora, and say that a double-counting syllable is made up of two morae, and a single-counting syllable is made up of one mora.
