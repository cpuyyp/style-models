Swapping the stem may make the riding more comfortable, but you may want to look at other things too Horizontal position of the seat - most seats will be able to be adjusted forwards or backwards. But if you change the position of the seat, relative to the cranks, you need to think about how this will affect your stroke. Handlebar width - if the handlebars are too wide you may feel like you are reaching too far forward, when in fact you are reaching too far out. A simple check is to stand across your bike in front of a mirror, put your hands on the hoods, and see how closely your handlebars match the width of your shoulders. Frame size - it's possible you have a bike that's too big for you. Although this is the most expensive thing to change, after riding a bike like that for a couple of years before finally spending the money on a properly fitted frame, I believe it's worth the money for the extra enjoyment you get from riding. 

Best solution is going to be to replace the hangar and the rear Derailer. However, you can take the hangar off and use a vise to get it flat. Clean it and the frame around that area to keep dirt from interfering with the attachment. Use blue loctite (formula 242) on the fasteners and a light coating of grease on the flat areas to keep dirt out. For the final alignment, what you want it is the rear derailer jockey pulleys to be perfectly parallel to the cassette/freewheel's cogs. The whole purpose of the rest of the derailer is to keep those jockey pulleys parallel as they move. Same is true for the rear derailer itself, but it is going to be more fragile than the frame hangar--you can try to straighten the RD, but it looks fairly cheap, and the metal used my be significantly work-hardened by all this bending, so it may break during the straightening attempts.... a replacement shouldn't be more than $10-$15 anyway. The LBS may have a 'pull' or used rear derailer that they can let go for a significant discount that'd still be an upgrade too. (If they don't, they don't... some shops don't allow this sort of sale...) Also, the jockey pulley brackets (that attach it to the parallelogram of the RD) may need to be straightened to be parallel to the RD body... but the majority of re-bending of the RD should be done close to the attachment point of the RD to the hangar, as it should be 'designed' to be adjusted there. Good luck! 

People tend to think of fit as something for which there is a single solution, i.e., a particular combination of frame size, seatpost height, stem length, and so forth, all of which will create the optimal size bike for them. In reality, it isn't that straightforward; proper fit can be achieved within a range of values. For example, I have a few different bikes which I ride. One is a road bike with a 58 cm frame (flat top tube), one is a more modern road bike with 53 cm frame (sloping top tube), and so forth. How is it that I can ride a collective 16,000 km on these different-sized bikes and be comfortable? Because I have adjusted the combination of frame size, seatpost height, and stem length within a range that works for me. You can achieve the same; it's not difficult. 

The most practical solution would be to upgrade your brake pads. They may seem expensive, but both Koolstop and SwissStop work pretty good. Search around, there are many online sellers. You can see a significant change in brake performance with the right pads installed. 

The specific swap you describe may work just fine since nearly all SRAM chainrings and cogsets use the same spacings as Shimano. So, mechanically, the SRAM cogs and Shimano cogs are interchangeable under whatever FD/RD you have.(Campagnolo, not so much!) This assumes you are using a briter/shifter set that is compatible with your FD+RD combo. (e.g. early D.A. or something else wacky won't work) That's the real potential issue. There are also concerns matching brake lever pull (range/ratio) if you use brifters too. Those aren't even guaranteed to match across the same MFG line anymore... (e.g. Shimano's ultegra recently had a change to the brake pull setup... they'll still 'work' with mismatched components--old&new ultegra, just not as shimano intended--Brakes are one of the few dedicated safety systems on a bike, so make sure you're extra careful with mixing MFG/Lines there.) In the end, it is all just simple ratios and lengths. $URL$ may help explain some of this more in depth. (as the question is a little vague for a really short answer.. e.g. would need mfg part#'s for chanrings, cogs, and shift-levers--which are not provided) So, generally, for indexing to work, which I think is your concern... the gears really don't matter as long as the levers match them and the levers have a proper pull for the FD/RD. (e.g. worry more about the lever compatiblity than the RD/FD) However... After the swap, the bike will shift differently. The big-three all sound slightly different when they change gears, so don't be surprised if the bike feels/sounds a little different after the swap. A (new) chain that matches the rear cluster can help, but YMMV... your old chain may do just fine too! 

Any sort of rubbing is undesirable. But, when the QR is open, things are likely to rub because the wheel can move around in the dropouts, so the only thing that needs attention is the rubbing when the QR is closed. Your front tyre should be centred between the forks when the QR is closed, if it's not and your disc is rubbing you certainly need some adjustment to your bike. Possible causes of your problem are: Wheel is not firmly seated in the dropout - @rider_x tells you how to check this in his answer. QR skewer is bent - if the skewer has been damaged, the wheel may be pulled off-centre when you tighten the QR clamp. Take the skewer out of the hub and check everything is straight. Pay attention to the springs when you remove the skewer and be sure to put them back with the narrow ends towards the wheel. Wheel is bent or not true - take it to a bike shop for repair. 

Check your headset as part of your efforts. A loose headset can cause shudders, even with rim brakes. Also, check the general adjustments of all the 'front parts'... Hub bearings, spokes, stem, rotor bolt torque, Caliper bolts, and check the fork for damage as well. (damage isn't likely, IMHO). Also, make sure the QR is tight if present, and if not, check the front wheel bolt torque. If that doesn't address your problem, I'd suggest doing a run-out measurement on the rotor and compare to your manufacturer's requirements. Also, clean the disk, trash/oil on it can cause problems too. The pads can do a wonderful job on this, but sometimes they need help... especially w.r.t. oil/grease. What really occurs during bedding-in is not important, nor is how you do it... what is important is that the rotor is cleaned and the caliper+pads get a final micro-alignment to the rotor (via the initial wearing of the pads). Once this micro-alignment happens, the braking should be very consistent... which is why some shops may want to 'bed your pads' for you. Any material 'deposited' on the rotors will be quickly removed as dust by the pads anyway. 

It doesn't take much of a change in the stem length to make a difference. Long story short, I changed my saddle and my bars, and started getting horrible back pain after 40 miles or so. I shortened my stem by 30 mm, and all is well. I can ride 70 miles or more before I start feeling any pains, but back pain is not one of them, typically. If you can't post pics of your bike, measurements would be helpful for you to know. In addition, check your bike vs. a fit calculator like this one. Make sure you're in the range of numbers before you start throwing money at this problem. 

Collectively, were you to follow all of their recommendations (regarding chain lube, specific chain, pedal, derailleur pulleys, and so forth), they suggest that these improvements will collectively deliver about a 20 Watt savings, which is pretty significant. But I am not a professional racer, and I ride mainly for fitness, so I don't mind some losses due to drivetrain inefficiencies, and if a particular lube delivered extra chain life, I might consider it, even if it was not as efficient as some. BTW, I'm writing from the U.S., and have no idea what GT85 is. 

In short, no. Bad idea. But if you get lucky a couple of times, yes, it could work like you want. 8spd freewheels cost about the same as 7spds, so not much risk in 'going for it' and failing. Realistically, stick to 7 spd and upgrade the RD for the extra capacity to deal with the big cog if you must... but I'd try it out first, they usually ship long cage derailers on those bikes, so you are most likely fine as-is. I liked the megarange gear selections when I swapped to it. Potential problems: -There is a chance that your old 7spd and the new 8spd do not index the same... 4.8 vs 5 mm -You may need to re-dish your rear wheel to deal with the extra room for the extra cog. Again, you'll have to fit the 8spd freewheel to see if this is the case, but I'd say there is likely a problem here... and that may mean new spokes and a wheel re-build. (or forking out $11 for a 7spd freewheel) -Freewheel stackup is different between the 7spd and 8spd.. the 8spd is longer... This can cause problems like your RD getting into the spokes to hit that last gear... so even if it fits, you may have to use the smallest 7 and not the largest 7 to keep your RD out of the spokes.. The issue isn't so much the O.L.D. (135mm) it is the stack-height of the 8spd freewheel and where the 'extra' height of the 8spd vs your 7spd goes in relation to the spokes (e.g. that 8th gear is closer to the spokes) Back when 8spd was new I did see a lot of these conversions work just like you want this one too... some were super picky and the RD would need near constant adjustments due to temperature changes throwing off the indexing (5mm vs 4.8mm gear center-to-center) A lot of pain when you could just pay $23 for a 8spd right-only shifter that would index properly... But the gears have to fit and the RD has to stay out of the spokes! Good luck! 

A good full-suspension bike will make offroad riding better in two respects: 1) The rear suspension can help keep your rear tire almost glued to the dirt, meaning better traction when needed; 2) The rear suspension can help soak up trail buzz, resulting in greater comfort/less fatigue, especially if you don't have the bod of an elite cyclist with noodle arms and a concave chest. I've ridden a local trail with my 1980's vintage MTB (no suspension) and my recent vintage full-suspension bike (Trek Fuel EX 8) and it is like night and day. The bike weight is roughly the same (they built those first-generation MTBs like tanks), but I can go much faster and more comfortably on my Trek Fuel EX 8, especially when I am descending. The full suspension on the Trek makes it much more controllable and comfortable. I admit that I have been passed by guys on hardtails many times, but I outweigh these guys by a few pounds and I definitely don't have the elite cyclist bod. I'm also older than most of them, judging based on appearance. Those are two factors that none of the other responders to-date have mentioned: age and size/weight. In a nutshell, according to my experience, if you are young and/or thin, you may do just fine with a hardtail. But if you are not young and/or not thin, you would probably find greater enjoyment with a FS bike. Most of the folks that I ride with would qualify as "Clydesdales," meaning they weigh 200 lbs or more. All of the Clydes have FS bikes for offroad riding.
