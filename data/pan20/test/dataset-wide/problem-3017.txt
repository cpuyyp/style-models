I can answer part of your question. 2) After sunk a ship instead of killing the survivor the submarine just go away. I have seen other episodes where the submarine crew use machine guns to kill all floating survivor. Is that a tactic implemented later? On this case the survivor went and alert about the submarine presence. Shooting survivors of a ship that you sunk was against the laws of war. It was a war crime. Only someone evil would do it. Therefore, not every submarine crew always machined gunned survivors of ships they sank. 

It is perfectly possible that burial has been practiced by non human and even non primate beings. Elephants sometimes bury dead elephants. In fact they sometimes bury dead or sleeping humans as well. $URL$ $URL$ 

$URL$ In 1521 Emperor Charles V gave the Archduchy of Austria and other Austrian lands to his younger brother Ferdinand I. Ferdinand I did not used the title of "King of Hungary" since his older brother Emperor Charles V was the heir to the family's hereditary claim to the Hungarian throne. Then King Louis II of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania, and Bulgaria was killed at the Battle of Mohacs on 29 August 1526. Ferdinand I of Austria, married to Louis's sister Anne Jagellion, claimed the thrones of Hungary and Bohemia and was elected King separately in both kingdoms. So naturally Ferdinand added "King of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania, and Bulgaria" to his titles in 1526. 

$URL$ Mary's sister Elizabeth I never married. In 1688 William III (1650-1702), Stadtholder of the Netherlands and Prince of Orange, invaded England and overthrew his uncle King James II. William and his wife Mary II (1662-1694), elder daughter of King James, became joint monarchs of England, Scotland, and Ireland. 

$URL$ 3) a) Largest percentage of the world's population: Many sources say that the Achaemenid Empire in 480 BC ruled 44 percent of the world's population. But that is disputed here, in post # 12. $URL$ Post number 16 gives more accurate figures for various realms including a more accurate (hopefully) list of the ten historical empires with the largest percentages of the world's population. 

It is certainly easy to keep track of the days of the week. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And if someone forgot the weekday, he would be reminded when the church bells rang on the next Sunday. Country people were often serfs who had obligations to work for their lord so many days a week or so many days a month. So naturally they tended to keep track of time so the lord's agents didn't trick them into working for him twice a month. And there ere feast days. Every day of the year has one or more saint's feast days. And the more important feast days were celebrated with masses and rituals. For example, Candlemas is on February 2. Many or most towns in medieval western Europe were the seats of bishops of dioceses. So many or most towns in medieval western Europe had Bishop's cathedrals, cathedral schools, bishop's palaces, etc., etc. And there were often one or more monasteries in or near a town. One task of a medieval bishop was to make sure that church holidays were celebrated at the right time, especially movable feasts like Easter. Elaborate calculations were needed to determine which day Easter should be celebrated each year. So most bishop's headquarters would have people who kept track of the date. Many medieval craftsmen and their subordinates would make a lot of identical products and put them up for sale. But some would make a lot of custom products to the order of their customers. Thus they would often need to keep track of getting their orders finished before any deadlines and/or whether they were paid at the agreed date. Moneylenders and bankers, and the people they made loans to, had to keep track of the date to be sure they paid and/or were paid on time. Many properties in a town, or rooms in the buildings, would be rented, and the renters and landlords had to keep track of when the rent was due. So a lot of townspeople had to keep track of the date, and no doubt they found ways to do so. So perhaps some churches or town halls or moneylender's offices had exterior bulletin boards with the date posted every day for those who could read. in the later middle ages mechanical clocks were installed in many town hall towers. They often did not have just dials but elaborate mechanical displays. So perhaps they sometimes displayed the date. 

Napoleon III was President of France from 1848-1852 and Emperor from 1852 to 1870, a measly 22 years in total. Napoleon I was consul of France from 1799-1804 and Emperor from 1804 to 1814, or fifteen long and glorious years, plus a hundred more days in 1815. Napoleon III only managed to give France a mere 18 years of peace in his reign. Napoleon I gave France a full year of peace in 1802-1803 during his reign. So clearly Napoleon I was far superior. 

In modern times three gold balls were often used by pawnbrokers to identify their shops. An old book about heraldry claimed that the three gold balls of pawnbrokers are based on the medieval signs for bankers, which were based on the coat of arms of the medieval kingdom of Italy or Lombardy where important Lombard bankers came from. That kingdom became merged into the Holy Roman Empire before heraldry was used, and thus probably never had an official coat of arms, though that didn't stop Italian noble familes from claiming descent from the kings of the Lombards and claiming that their coats of arms were based on the royal arms of Lombardy. For example, a Palli family used a coat of arms of Gules, three Bezants, and claimed to be descended from a nephew of Desiderious, last king of the Lombards. In heraldry a solid gold or yellow circle or roundel is called a bezant, representing a golden Byzantine coin. A white or silver roundel is called a plate and might be based on a silver coin. I hope this might help until someone with more medieval knowledge can help you. 

Eohric probably didn't have a banner but he probably did have a flag of some type. A banner is a heraldic flag with a coat of arms. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Since Eohric lived before heraldry he couldn't have had a heraldic banner, so it would be more correct and less anachronistic to speak about his flag or flags. 

Probably the same way that bribery in the elections of bishops was honored? Or in the elections for MPs from rotten boroughs in England? What about ensuring that bribery in the elections of municipal officials was honored? What about elections for king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1572 to 1796? What about imperial elections? There were many elective offices in that era, and in some cases the number of electors, such as the cardinals and the imperial electors, was small enough that bribery was feasible. So researching allegations of bribery in elections for other offices will no doubt give some clues about the practical mechanics of bribery in papal elections. 

Irish history in that era is a fascinating mystery. After the conversion of Ireland became largely successful and some Christian Irish became literate and began recording historical events soon after they happened. They also began to write histories of past events in Latin and in Irish - histories whose degree of accuracy is rather speculative and controversial. For most of the history of Roman rule in Britain relations with Ireland would have been mostly commercial. In late Roman times various Irish groups raided Britain and others settled in Britain. The soldiers of Coroticus who enslaved some of Patrick's Irish converts according to the "Epistola ad Coroticum" were from Britain or served a British born leader, so the raiding was not one-sided in that era. Early hagiographies of St. Patrick claimed he interacted with High King Loegaire, who supposedly died about 462, with modern estimates that he ruled sometime about 450 to the late 480s. Loegaire was a son of High King Niall of the Nine Hostages, who allegedly died before 382, or in 395, or in 405, or in 411. Modern historians believe he died about 450. So it is not surprising that the chronicles report that Saint Patrick died in 457, or 462/3, or 492/3 at the age of 120. So there were many possibly correct things written about Saint Patrick in decades or centuries after his time, but the only certain things about his biography come from biographical details mentioned in the two, or possibly more, accounts he himself wrote. 

I have the impression that the pre-Marian Roman army was a sort of militia. Free men were more or less automatically enrolled when old enough and were expected to meet to train, provide their own weapons, and to serve if called up. So Roman citizens and allies didn't join the army, they were born as citizens of Rome or their native allied city or tribe and became part time soldiers as soon as they were old enough. So unless I am wrong, almost no Romans or Italians "joined" the army before the reforms of Marius, they were all citizen soldiers legally required to serve when called up. They were all born as future part time soldiers. Thus there were no "incentives", any more than there were for Americans drafted between 1940 and 1973. 

$URL$ Thus the Tatar control of Russia may have become slighter and slighter, weaker and weaker, over several centuries before and after the Stadoff and the Ugra River. I believe that the Tatars sometimes demanded tribute and other facets of over lordship from the Russians after the Standoff on the Ungra, and that they sometimes succeeded in their demands. In 1571 the crimean Tartars burned Moscow except from the Kremlin, and it was said that only 30,000 survived out of a population of 200,000, and made and unsuccessful attack in 1591. Since the Russians didn't always have the military advantage, they may have sometimes agreed to pay tribute to Crimea. The treaty of Constantinople in 1700 ending the Russian-Turkish War of 1686-1700 included a clause abolishing the annual tribe from Russia to the Crimean Khanate. $URL$ 

During the time of the Reformation there were only a few kingdoms in Catholic Europe except for a few dozen kingdoms in Ireland that aren't usually considered. They were: 1) Kingdom of Scotland - turned Protestant. 2) Kingdom of England - turned Protestant. 3) (English) Kingdom of Ireland - turned Protestant. 4) Kingdom of France - remained Catholic. 5) Kingdom of Navarre - turned Protestant 1560. 6) Kingdom of Portugal - remained Catholic. 7) Kingdom of Castile and associated kingdoms - remained Catholic. 8) Kingdom of Aragon and associated kingdoms including Sicily, Sicily, and Sardinia - remained Catholic. 9) Kingdom of Norway - turned Protestant. 10) Kingdom of Sweden - turned Protestant. 11) Kingdom of Denmark - turned Protestant. 12) Kingdom of Poland - remained Catholic. 13) Kingdom of Hungary - remained Catholic. 14) Kingdom of Bohemia - already mostly (Hussite) Protestant, reconverted to Catholicism after 1620. Not counting Bohemia the score is seven protestant and 6 Catholic. Furthermore the Habsburg dynasty ruled the Castilian and Aragonese groups of kingdoms and Hungary and Bohemia, making about only four royal dynasties that remained Catholic. Without the Habsburgs most of Europe might have turned protestant instead of merely Britain, Scandinavia, and northern Germany. Possibly the royal dynasties that remained Catholic did so because they thought that enriching themselves and their nobles by confiscating church lands was stealing.
