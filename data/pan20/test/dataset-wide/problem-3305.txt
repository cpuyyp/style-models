It probably is not too surprising that digraphs containing the letter "e" would be used to represent sounds in the area of [e] or [ɛ]. Any further connection than that seems like mainly a coincidence to me. Both of these digraphs have complicated histories involving many sound changes over the centuries. AE Old Latin had a sound spelled "ai", whose pronunciation we reconstruct as something like [ai̯] or [aj]. In Classical Latin, this sound came to be spelled as "ae", which may indicate that it had come to be pronounced as a diphthong with a final element somewhat opener than IPA cardinal [i]--something like [aɪ̯] or [ae̯]. In the Romance languages, the reflex of this sound is generally the same as the reflex of Latin "short e", whose pronunciation is reconstructed as [ɛ]—this contrasts with the reflex of Latin "long e", whose pronunciation immediately preceding the loss of vowel length is reconstructed as [eː] (after the loss of vowel length, the reflex of Latin "long e" merged with the reflex of Latin "short i" in the ancestors of most Romance languages to become *e). Based on this, it is thought that there was a progression from [ai̯] > [ae̯] > [ɛː] > [ɛ] (and then on to various other reflexes in particular Romance languages). After "ae" was monophthongized, it often came to be replaced in spelling with "e" in Medieval Latin, but the modern tradition of writing Latin has returned to using "ae", and English students who learn "Restored Pronunciation" are taught to use the English "price" vowel /aɪ/ as an approximation to the Roman pronunciation. English speakers who are using a pronunciation modeled after the "Ecclesiastical" or "Italian" tradition of pronouncing Latin may use the "face" vowel /eɪ/ for "ae", although written guides to Ecclesiastical Latin often recommend that English speakers use the "dress" vowel /ɛ/ instead. Word-final DRESS is foreign to English phonotactics, which may be one reason why even "Ecclesiastical"-influenced English speakers don't tend to use word-final /ɛ/ in the pronunciation of English words from Latin. In the traditional English pronunciation of Latin, "ae" came to be pronounced as /iː/ because of the Great Vowel Shift, except for when it was shortened due to being in a closed syllable or a "trisyllabic laxing" context: then the reflex was /ɛ/. However, there was also a tradition (I'm unsure about how old it was) of using the "long" value /iː/ for "ae" in all positions, which has left its mark in the form of certain, chiefly British English pronunciations of some English words or names that were taken from Latin and that are spelled with "ae" (e.g. "aesthete" or "Daedalus"). EA As ba mentioned, the digraph "ea" was used in Old English to represent both a long diphthong whose pronunciation is reconstructed as /æːɑ̯/, and a short diphthong whose pronunciation is reconstructed as /æɑ̯/. The letter "e" was used in Old English to represent both a short vowel /e/ and a long vowel /eː/. The letter "æ" was used to represent both a short vowel /æ/ and a long vowel /æː/, and the letter "a" was used to represent both a short vowel /ɑ/ and a long vowel /ɑː/. So if we look at the Old English origin of the digraph "ea", it's not a matter of "e" representing a "short" "eh" sound and "a" being added to make this a "long" "ay" sound. The association of those sounds with these written representations develops much later on. By the time of Middle English, short "ea" had merged with short "æ" and short "a" to become some single low vowel phoneme like /a/, typically written "a" (Middle English sound changes would lead to the development of a distinct lengthened phoneme /aː/), and long "ea" had merged with long "æ" to become a single front mid-low vowel phoneme /ɛː/, which contrasted with mid-high /eː/, from Old English /eː/. My understanding is that Middle English continued to use "e" for both short /e/ and long /eː/, but the digraph "ee" was also used for long /eː/, as well as long /ɛː/. The digraph "ea" was also used for long /ɛː/. There is also another important source of Middle English /ɛː/. In Middle English, a sound change occurred that affected the pronunciation of many vowels. I have seen this sound change variously described as open-syllable lengthening (in certain contexts) or as compensatory lengthening of a vowel in an open syllable when the following syllable lost a schwa sound. Whatever the exact nature of the conditioning factor, the result of the sound change was that short /e/ developed to long /ɛː/ in a number of words. These words with /ɛː/ could have the spelling pattern "eCe" or "ee", but for whatever reason, after the Middle English period the spelling pattern "eCe" became uncommon and the spelling pattern "ee" became more restricted to words with the higher vowel quality, so a number of words that originally had short /e/ in Old English ended up being spelled with the digraph "ea" in modern English. An example is "meat", from Old English mete [mete], Middle English mete [mɛːt(ə)]. The "Great Vowel Shift" that is considered the boundary between Middle English and Modern English includes the sound changes /eː/ > /iː/ and /ɛː/ > /eː/; this resulting in the digraph "ea" representing the quality /eː/. The subsequent development of this /eː/ varied between dialects: in English "RP", it merged into /iː/ in all but a handful of words (like great, steak, break); in some other dialects, it may have been regular for it to merge with the reflex of Middle English "long a" and "ay~ai", although there are also some arguments for certain dialects only having a "near-merger" of the "ea" and the "long a" sound. The merger of the "ea" sound with the "long a/ay" sound is the point where we get pronunciations like "tea = tay". Middle English /ɛː/ was sometimes shortened instead, somewhat sporadically, which resulted in Modern English /ɛ/, as in "deaf" and "dead". 

Actually, it does still have a number of digraphs and trigraphs that are likely to be somewhat unintuitive for an untrained monoglot English speaker: 

The Ancient Greek words ἀοργησία aorgesia "a defect in the passion of anger" and ἀόριστος aoristos "without boundaries" both start with the "alpha privatum," the negative prefix cognate to English un- and Latin -in/-im/-ir/-il. However, every source that I have looked up has said that this prefix is realized as ἀν- an- when it comes before a vowel (including one that was historically preceded by a rough breathing /h/). What is the explanation for these exceptions, and do any others exist? EDIT: I kind of found the answer, so I guess I will post it in case anyone else has this problem later on. I may have follow-up questions. 

I think you're just hearing the lack of aspiration; English and German "t" is generally aspirated at the start of a syllable, while Spanish and Italian generally lack aspiration on voiceless plosives (but their voiced plosives start their voicing earlier). (For a more detailed comparison of English and Spanish plosives, see The Sounds of Spanish, by José Ignacio Hualde.) These differences are related to voice onset time. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, we can indicate aspiration with a superscript ʰ after the letter for a regular voiceless consonant, so the sound at the start of English "ten" can be writen as [tʰ]. Unaspirated (also called tenuis) voiceless stops are quite common and found in many languages. Some languages, such as Hindi and Ancient Greek, contrast voiceless aspirated plosive phonemes ([pʰ], like in English "pin"), voiceless tenuis plosive phonemes ([p], like in English "spin" or Spanish "pollo"), and voiced plosive phonemes ([b], like in Spanish "bello"). (I used the example of "p" rather than "t" because Hindi actually has two types of "t/d" sound, dental and retroflex. In fact, Hindi also has one more type of phonation: the "voiced aspirate" or "murmured" plosives, represented by appending ʱ to a voiced plosive symbol.) 

This quotation and the OED entry both seem to agree that the word in its modern form entered English from French. The OED also gives the following indications of the timing of this loan: 

Partial answer: As commenters and other answers have mentioned, morpheme boundaries may be important to the syllabification of a word. Wells's rules are not meant to apply to all words: the existence of exceptions is made clear in the Introduction (which refers to "competing pronunciations that differ only in syllabification" and "morpheme boundaries ... that upset the implicitly expected syllabification"). 

I assume you're following the analogy of the /k~ts/ alternations in words like kluk, klucích. The sound /g/ is a voiced counterpart to the sound /k/, and likewise the sound /dz/ is a voiced counterpart to the sound /ts/. 

Both "poor" /pʊər/ and "doom" /duːm/ represent regular developments of pre-GVS /oː/ in modern standard English. The difference is in fact the context. The vowel /ʊə/ is the normal reflex before an /r/, and the vowel /uː/ is the normal reflex in other contexts (in fact, when dealing with a dialect that still retains syllable-final /r/, it's possible to analyze [ʊə] as simply an allophone of /u/). However, /ʊər/ has historically been unstable as a phoneme; there are a wide range of possible realizations, and for many speakers in many dialects it has merged with other phonemes. The tricky part is that which phoneme it merges with depends on the dialect and on the particular word. It may merge with /ɔːr/ as in "more", or disyllabic /u.ɚ/ as in "doer", or (especially after /j/) with /ɝ/ as in "nurse." For more details, you can look at the Wikipedia article on "English-language vowel changes before historic /r/". So the only issue is with the pronunciation of the word "door." According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, "door" actually appears to continue two OE words: 

There is also a third set of words that can have a distinct vowel sound: certain words, usually spelled with ay/ai/ey/ei, that had some diphthong like [ai] or [æi] in Middle English. In most accents, this merged with the late vowel, but in some British accents, it remained distinct. Wikipedia says 

So we can see some degree of heteronymy is commonly present in writing systems from the very beginning. Heterographs in alphabetic writing systems Generally, someone designing (consciously or just through use) a new alphabetic writing system does not plan on including heterographs. However, there are a few processes that naturally cause them to arise. Sound changes: That's one of the main causes in English. If two sounds merge in some context, you're likely to get heterographs (such as you're, your, yore). Generally, these accumulate over time, so an older writing system will have more of them. In some cases, heterographs are present from the beginning for some speakers due to variation between different accents of the language (some accents may have a merger that doesn't exist in others, and the writing system is based on the un-merged accent). Loanwords: It's possible for all loanwords to be re-spelled according to the borrowing language's writing system. However, there are many languages like English that tend to preserve the original spelling. This may cause heterographs. 

To put the claims you mention in perspective, it might also help to compare irregular verbs in English and other Indo-European languages to those in Basque and Hungarian (which are not related to Indo-European languages (or to each other) within a timeframe that we know of). Wikipedia says that Basque has irregular verbs meaning things like "be," "have," and "say," and Hungarian has irregular verbs meaning "to be", "to come" and "to go." Even though they're not related, it shouldn't be surprising that the irregular verbs have similar meanings in Indo-European languages, Basque, and Hungarian, for two reasons: 

As for why/how the fronting occurred: I don't have any answer, sorry. All I can offer is some similar changes in other languages, such as Greek (where ancient /u/ became Classical Greek /y/) and modern English (where /u/ is often fronted more or less, depending in part on the phonetic environment). A bit of Googling turned up the following paper: "The Feature [Advanced Tongue Root] and Vowel Fronting in Romance," by Andrea Calabrese. Calabrese says 

(partial answer) Actually, the uvular stop in Semitic languages is often thought to have developed from an earlier "emphatic" velar stop. I think there are some extant Semitic languages where it is realized with some kind of secondary articulation rather than a simple uvular POA. Wikipedia says that emphatic "p" also occurs/occured in some Semitic languages (Hebrew and Ge'ez), although it might have been a secondary development related to loanwords. However, aside from that, I don't know the answer to your question because pharyngealized consonants seem to be relatively rare and in Semitic, the most well-known group of languages that have them, they are already present in the reconstructed proto-language (although descendent languages may have somewhat different distributions) In loanwords into Semitic, words that in the source language had unaspirated voiceless stops or back vowels have sometimes been given naturalized pronunciations with "emphatic" consonants. 

To address the matter of German brought up in the question, it could be said to have three target genders in the singular, and one target gender in the plural. But the nouns fall into three controller-gender paradigms, not four. 

(p. 123) Sorry, I don't know anything about possible attested examples of -asъ, but I hope this explains why it might be considered the "expected" form. 

There are some sound changes between Proto-Germanic and Old English that are taken as evidence for the existence of a "dark" (i.e. velarized, uvularized or pharyngealized) allophone of /l/ (and /r/) in the pre-Old English time period. Wikipedia says: 

There seem to be similar examples of this sound change in Spanish. Using the Diccionario de la lengua española online, I found the following two examples of a Vulgar Latin sequence -ndin- becoming modern Spanish -ndr-: 

Also from Wiktionary, I found a claim that Gothic at least allowed stacking of pre-verbs in such a way as to place them word-internally (and this seems to be backed up by other sources such as Phrasal Verbs: The English Verb-Particle Construction and its History by Stefan Thim): 

The form of a noun used with a numeral can vary a lot depending on the language, and it's not always restricted to two options. Some languages, such as Hungarian, use only the singular with all numerals, leaving off the redundant plural marker in this case, but using it on nouns not accompanied by a numeral. Some languages, besides singular and plural forms, might also use a dual or a genitive form with some numerals. The following link about internationalization of software contains discussion of the issue. $URL$ According to this source, languages that use the singular for one and zero, and the plural for other numerals include French and Brazilian Portuguese.
