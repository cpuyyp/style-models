I use a wind-up kitchen timer. Because it is low-tech, it works better for me than a smartphone app, which has a subtle distracting effect due to being an open-ended device. I do make sure to have no clocks in sight. In the zendo we used to have a giant pendulum clock, which ticked loudly and chimed every 15 minutes. That had its charm too :) Another way to keep time is to count breaths on phalanges of hands, with the thumb. 3 phalanges times 4 fingers makes 12. 12 on one hand times 12 on the other makes 144 (breaths). This is about 25-30 minutes, depending how you breath. 

Lamrim is a genre. It is a genre of spiritual literature that gives a thorough overview of the whole teaching, methodically progressing from somewhat crude and primitive concepts of basic levels, to more sophisticated and nuanced perspectives of the higher levels. Each school usually has their favorite lamrim text or two (one for beginning students, one for advanced students and teachers), but if you read them side by side they are all pretty similar in content and sequence, the biggest difference being that of depth and tone. It is not uncommon for a lamrim text to take form of a condensed poem for easy memorization, which then requires a commentary text to hydrate the meaning back to a comprehensible shape. In Theravada, the idea of stages of the path is not very developed. I'm not talking about levels of mastery of one technique like the 16 stages of Vipassana (there are such texts in Tibetan Buddhism as well, but they are not lamrim) but rather the epic levels that almost completely supersede each other's frameworks, such that the concepts very important at one level look rather naive at subsequent levels. It is hard to call Visuddhimagga a lamrim text, for two reasons. First, because its scope is limited to what in a lamrim text would be about one sixth of the full path. Second, because it delves very deep into topics that in Tibetan schools usually belong in specialized meditation texts. The lamrim progression is roughly: 

As @Yuttadhammo pointed out, relative and absolute truths are a Mahayana construct. In Pali Canon, Buddha does not declare such duality (all he does is caution his students against taking his metaphors literally). From Mahayana standpoint, the phenomenal world, consisting of subject and its objects as well as relationships between them, is relative truth. Any description of reality is necessarily in the realm of relative truth as it depends on arbitrary axioms posited against each other. The ultimate truth ("what really IS") is therefore ineffable, but can be tapped in practice through deconstructing all (relative) constructs. The difference between Relative and Ultimate truths becomes important for understanding Mahayana concept of Enlightenment: From Mahayana perspective, the Path to Nirvana an individual walks belongs firmly in Relative Truth. However, because ultimately no separate "individual" exists apart from the interacting mental-and-physical factors, there is no entity that achieves Nirvana. Instead, when Three Marks of existence are fully realized as Emptiness of Interbeing, the notion of Nirvana is no longer applicable and Self-Existing Enlightenment can finally be realized. Reality is an interpretation we make. Our everyday world, with its "I" and "others", birth and death is one such interpretation. The world of Buddhist practitioners, with its skandhas, samskaras, dharmas, and nirvana is another interpretation, adopted temporarily as a stepping stone from the first. Regardless of where one is on the Path, Ultimate Truth remains the ground reality underlying all worlds. 

I listen to Chogyam Trungpa's teachings up on chronicleproject.com/teachings There are both audio and video talks. They also have a number of podcasts from students and related people connected with Trungpa Rinpoche's lineage. 

IMO meditation is absolutely critical, but not at beginner's stages. I would even go as far as to recommend at least five years of practice before one tries meditation. What would that practice look like? 

My first teacher taught how different types of attachments lead to certain karmic situations. According to that system, homosexuality comes from attachment to high ideals and high standards. Different types and levels of attachment to high ideals lead to different scenarios, some lead to cancer, some to immune system problems, some to mental illness, while some end up growing into positive achievements. There all kinds of karmic scenarios, in one life or spread over multiple lives, so it's hard to be more specific, but generally speaking there's connection between attachment to high ideals and high standards, and homosexuality. 

Again, I'm not sure I got all the details 100% right, but the main point is that subjective experience develops from complete non-differentiation -- to a full-blown individuation, through a series of steps that build on one another. Generally speaking, we learn to recognize and differentiate our experiences, until we develop attachments to some of them, and from this attachment comes a sense of conflict with the world which eventually arises as a notion of separate "I". Also note how four of these refer corresponding skandhas. Because this process is entirely pre-conscious, we're only aware of its result - the experience of being a sentient being living in the world. We are not aware of the mechanisms at play, because we (=our experience of ourselves) are a result of this process! However, this process comes with a payload of trouble, due to the tendency of reification and conflict built into it's very foundation. Enlightenment involves gradual liberation from the limitations of experience imposed by this process. This liberation is done through detachment from "realities" generated by the process (so called "self" and "world"), through increased awareness of the process' mechanisms and their implications, and through learning a new, higher, mode of perception that does not involve naive reification of our interpretations as the reality. As this Enlightenment progresses, we start seeing through the magic tricks of the process. In this sense we can say that the twelve steps of individuation are getting undone: 

Dukkha is the feeling that something is wrong, something is missing, something is not good enough. Your feeling when you look at your meditation and you realize it's not good enough - that's dukkha. Not self is traditionally explained as our inability to control anything, not even thoughts. Another way to see no-self is to see how the thoughts float into one another, specifically how the thought that is watching becomes the thought being watched by the next thought. 

Could lobha and dosa be working in tandem? TL; DR version: No, even though the leg pain is inversely projected as a desire for the pain to end, we say this is only dosa, because the mind is obsessed specifically with the pain, while the absence of pain is not a concrete object of mind at this time, but only an implied possibility. (What follows is my personal understanding, based on my vipassana meditation. Most of this did not come from a book, for good or for bad. You've been warned.) What works in tandem are patikkula (repulsive, disagreeable) and appatikkula (non-repulsive, agreeable), which are two sides of the same phenomena, called tanha. As OP correctly assumed in the question, the two are related -- through the principle of dependent-coarising: 

While Stephen Bachelor is a great guy, he is known to go overboard with his atheistic view ;) As I understand, alayavijnana has nothing to do with soul, it is a concept invented by Yogacaras to explain how karma could work given their only-mind-is-real heresy. It is supposedly a layer of vijnana that acts as "storage" (alaya) of subsequent manifestations. But because other schools of Buddhism do not insist on reducing everything to mind, they can have karma working without any such notion of storage consciousness. Subsequent generations of Buddhists in Tibet adopted the term to indicate deep layers of subconsciousness. 

Five precepts are not about forcing oneself to do something unnatural that reduces one's enjoyment of life. It's not like that at all! :) Instead, in the beginning we tend to be a little confused about ways to enjoy life, and while thinking we're pursuing enjoyment, we sometimes hurt ourselves. It's like a kid eating playdough thinking he enjoys it but in fact only getting sick in the stomach. What precepts are really about is our mental and emotional stability. They are the opposite of getting carried away and eating playdough. 

The main idea is pretty Zen yes. The premise of the book is that Western philosophy made a wrong turn at Aristotle, who placed (conceptual) Truth at the top of the hierarchy of all knowable, thereby subsuming the Good (aka Quality aka Beauty) as a byproduct of Truth. Through this sleight of hands the conceptual has falsely acquired status of universal, while the experiential from being the mother of conceptual became its slave and hostage. Instead, argues the author, the (preconceptual) Good exists in the sphere of direct experience, and can be known directly. According to author, true understanding of Quality, Beauty and Ethics is possible only through such direct nonconceptual contact with the principle of Good. At which point Good is reinstated to the throne of knowable and Truth becomes merely one of alternative ways of attaining Good. This very much parallels Zen Buddhism's interpretation of Buddha-Dharma, according to which Self-Existing Enlightenment is not to be understood through analytical reasoning, but is awakened to through direct experience. Meditation, koan work, interviews with Zen Master, calligraphy, tea ceremony etc. are all means of getting in touch with this direct experience, which in Zen Buddhism is emphasized over analytical study of texts. In my opinion it would not be too much of a stretch to equate book author's direct insight into Good/Quality with Enlightenment as it is understood in Zen Buddhism. Although technically, Zen Buddhism goes further in that it gets one into direct contact not just with Good, but also with the very Emptiness itself. So strictly speaking the author falls short of full-scale Enlightenment, but still does a good job illuminating the trap of strict rationality and the primacy of direct experience. 

Since you asked about "other traditions" I could not go by without mentioning Prajna-Paramita, a movement within early Mahayana that emerged as a reaction against Abhidhammists (personified by Sariputta) allegedly reifying dhammas as ultimately real. According to Prajna-Paramita, the view of dhammas as having independent self-existence (despite Buddha explicitly declaring anatta as a characteristic of all conditioned phenomena without exception!) is yet another hindrance in the mind, leading to fear, confusion, and preventing awakening to (self-existing, unconditioned) Nirvana. Instead, the only ultimate reality is said to be Shunyata, unity of form and emptiness, an umbrella term for Three Characteristics of Existence plus Nirvana. 

"folk Buddhism", with emphasis on faith and basic morality, six worlds, karma the kind of stuff that's studied in Theravada: 4 noble truths, samatha, vipassana etc. mahayana stuff: bodhisattvas, paramitas hardcore madhyamika philosophy the (lower) tantra levels. Yidam generation and energy yoga. mahamudra and dzogchen dzogchen is sometimes separated into its own level above mahamudra 

The meaning of the story is that spiritual and mundane, mind and matter, information and media - are two sides of the same coin. Our nature from primordial times is pure and not different from Buddha nature. We think there's some truth or escape to be found outside of this world, but the truth is, this world is only an interpretation we make, the escape then is to be free from the interpretation. The one who gets this is the one who loses all but still has the guts to laugh. We call this, the Golden-haired Lion. 

What is meant by setting the "wheel" of Dharma in motion? Why is it called a wheel? Here is my interpretation based on "things I heard here and there" (so not official): In this ancient metaphor, a human society with its traditional ways is compared with a chariot ("yana", a word that also means "marching ahead"). Presumably, some sage or a visionary sets the chariot in motion, and then it rolls on for some time until it stops. A wheel-turning monarch is a leader who then supports and maintains this traditional order of things. Apparently the number of wheels in a chariot varies over time. In more ancient texts they are presumably listed as "artha" (success or prosperity) and "dharma" (in this context referring to morality or virtue) balancing each other as society moves from one generation to next. Newer texts are said to have added a third wheel of "kama" (enjoyment), followed by a fourth wheel of "moksha" (the spiritual quest for liberation). It is unclear how many "wheels" were recognized in Buddha's time, 2 or 3, but presumably the wheel of "moksha" or liberation was not added until after the Buddha's lifetime. We do not know if Buddha knew about this metaphor when he spoke about turning the wheel, but if he did, he would be referring to one specific wheel out of 2 or 3 - the wheel of Dharma. By turning the wheel of Dharma he was renewing or re-setting in motion the tradition of virtue and high ethics, that has seriously degraded by his time (judging by his criticism of brahmins with their corrupted morality). This tradition was then to be followed by the subsequent generations, propelling society to a greater virtue and thus enabling the growth of prosperity. (Which is kinda what happened if we look at the spread of Buddhism throughout the ancient Asian countries) The cyclic action here refers to the subsequent generations of people adopting the tradition and passing it on. Each generation of Buddhist students and teachers basically repeats Buddha's path: getting inspired by the possibility of Enlightenment, working on it in one's real life, achieving the realization, and passing some guidelines and insights to the next generation of students. 

So it sounds like visiting the village is allowed (and even required!) for food collection, and staying in the village overnight is allowed for emergencies. 

In Tibetan Buddhism, the primordial Buddha is Samantabhadra also known as Vajradhara. Primordial Buddha is not a personality, so has no personal history. It is the essence of ever-existing Sat-Dharma implicit in the very nature of things. $URL$ 

That is true. Most people are unfortunately pretty closed-minded - not because of a fault of their own or inherent weakness, but (quite counter-intuitively!) out of their best intents. People try to make sense of it all using their logic and common sense, and filter out all nonsense. But because it is so tangled up, it is not always obvious what is nonsense and what is real. Deferring to authority is infinitely easier than trying to make sense of it all by oneself. 

Initially, this means crosschecking our choices and actions against the Dharma and the opinions "of the wise" - instead of trying to get attention and validation from everyone around. This process of crosschecking everything against the reference point of Dharma/guru/elders is called "mindfulness". Taking Buddha (as the role model), Dharma (as the conceptual framework), and Sangha (of elder practitioners, as confirmation/validation) as your reference point for all decision making is called "taking the refuge". For as long as you are on the path, the Triple Gem becomes your source of praise and validation, your source of energy. Eventually, we should develop our own wisdom to see what's right and our own mental/emotional stability to the point where we can be independent of others as far as our energy. Basically we become egoless - meaning, we can now stop worrying about our image in the eyes of others, because we have completely internalized Dharma, we become the proverbial "wise" and "worthy". When that happens, attaining the second Jhana occurs spontaneously, since you have now rid yourself of the perpetual conflict between differing opinions and can truly become your own source of clarity, praise and energy.
