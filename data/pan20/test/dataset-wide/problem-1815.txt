If I try to connect to the server from a computer which is in another domain and ip subnet I get another error message (connection from client to server is possible): 

I think you're starting way too much server instances. Which module are you using as worker? prefork.c or worker.c? If youre using prefork.c set the values 'StartServers', MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers to a lower value and look if the server hangs again. 

At the first glance I would tell there is something wrong with your data partition (/data/data4). What kind of storage are you using? local disks, raid, nfs? Do you have any snapshots created for the vm's? If possible try to enable verbose logging somehow. I didn't find any VMware KB for the VMware Server 2 but there should be a configuration file in /etc or /opt. As always the question: why are you using VMware Server and not VMware ESXi? VMware Server 2 is not under development anymore and it's pretty slow if you compare it to ESXi. greetings grub 

Hm the role management tool only exists on Windows Server 2008. It's the replacement of Add / Remove Windows Components of the Windows Server 2003. Is it possible that you need at least SP2 on your windows server 2003? Or try to install the newest .Net Framework 2.0 Release prior to install the 3.5 release. Maybe you will find some usefull information in the 3.5 Readme: readme 

It depends on the linux distribution you're using. under debian like systems you have to change the contents of the file /etc/network/interfaces on rhel systems you have to edit the file /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg- (where is the name of your ethernet card e.g. eth0) you can add the entry "gateway" followed by the ip adress. as soon as you restart your network interface the routes will be added automatically to your routing table. Like Michael already wrote you can also just add the corresponding route instead of editing the configuration files. 

Maybe this blog entry can help you: $URL$ I remember that there is a Xorg Server plugin which enables you to open a vnc connection similar to a rdp session in windows with user authentication over your display manager but I really dont find the link to the plugin anymore. 

do you use vmfs3 for he datastores or vmfs2. vmfs2 is supported by esx4.1 but i head that you can get some issues if you try to use a vmfs2 datastore with different esx versions. did you try to restart the mgmt-vmware and the vmware-vpxa services on both esx 4.0 servers and rescan the datastores on each host, not only on the esx4.1? greetings grub 

I dont have experience with the sqlmaint.exe. especially on a windows server 2008. Install the newest MS SQL 2005 patches and try to run the command again. May be this helps. Do you want to run the backup job regularly? You can create a maintenance plan with the sql management studio. In the Maintenance plan you can create a cleanup job which deletes the old backups. the maintenance plans are a very good and stable way to create backups of your ms sql 2005 db's. You also should set more restrictive access to the network share. else everyone can create a new database from your backups or just delete them for fun. You could also take a look at the tool forfiles.exe. With this tool it's possible to search for files which meets some specified criteria and delete them (or do whatever you want). Have a nice day. 

Also try to deactivate NetBIOS and LMHOSTS for your Network Adapter. You can change the settings in the TCP/IP Properties of the used Network Connection, under Advanced -> WINS. 

Maybe you can deinstall with VBS and WMI. It's possible to access the entries in "Add / Remove Software". So if PopMessenger has an entry you can try to deinstall it automatically with a script. The script works on Windows XP per default not for Windows Server 2003 (missing some wmi classes). Save the script as deinstall_popmessenger.vbs and run it. Edit strSoftwareName and run it. First you'll get a popup if the software - entry was found. the line to uninstall the software is inactvie (comment '). 

a co-worker of mine absolutely insists that it's possible to mount a drive in windows server 2003 with two letters instead of one. He's not talking about mounting a drive into an empty ntfs - folder. example: use ab:\ instead of a:. I'm pretty sure that's not possible. I'm working with over 300 windows servers and never noticed that kind of feature. I also cant find any knowledge base or technet article which describes that kind of feature. Please tell me if it's possible or not. If it's possible please refer to the corresponding knowledge base or technet articles from microsoft. Thank you very much. 

Is JavaScript allowed in your firefox installation? (Tools->Options...->Content) Did you also try to clear the cache and cookies of your Firefox installation? You can empty it with Ctrl+Shift+Delete. 

The problem was solved ultimately by installing the latest MS SQL 2000 service packs prior installing the Service Pack for the OS. 

I dont have much experience with the MS SQL Express Databases on virtual machines but I think you just ran into the hardware restrictions of the MS SQL Express Edition. I assume that your physical server had 1 cpu with 2 cores. The MS SQL Express 2008 (and I think 2005 also) do support only ONE phyisical cpu but mulitple cores. A VM recognizes each vCPU's as a single CPU and not as an additional core. So the sqlserver.exe process is limited to 1 vCPU. 

Did you try to disconnect the session with the help of the "Terminal Services Manager". I don't know how the tool is called in Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7. In Windows 2003 / Windows XP you could connect to the server via the Terminal Service Manager and disconnect the session. Or try to restart the Windows service "Remote desktop services" on the Windows Server 2008 R2. The connected users should automatically be disconnected (never tried this before). Greetings grub 

As long as you're using a strong password for the user account which need to read the credentials it should be save to use the credential file. I'm using the credential files for many scheduled tasks (non-interacive shell). The shell is automatically closed after the scheduled tasks is finished and the $cred variable is deleted. In interactive shells I dont use the credential files because I'm able to specify username and password manually. Hope this helps. Have a nice day. Greetings grub 

The dns resolution works fine, and I've already rejoined the server into the domain. Could it be any issue with netbios ? Or do you now a method to debug the network share connection more detailed ? The hardware looks OK. DELL OpenManage is installed and does not report any errors. The newest drivers for the Intel NIC is installed. Thank you very much for your help, I have never seen such an issue before and do not know how to collect more information for the error. 

You need to add specific information for update-rc.d to your script. You'll find an example in /etc/init.d/skeleton 

The easiest way to integrate Domino is to use Lotus Quickr 1. We also have a big Lotus Domino Server farm but we're using sharepoint because of it's office integration and it is really easy to use. Whatever you're going to use I recommendend you to hire an consultant to get started with such a project. Both solutions are really big and you can waste much time without reaching your goals. 

Yesterday I installed the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 on a Windows Server 2003 which has Unicenter Software Delivery 4 installed. Prior to the installation I disabled every CA service on the server (Brightstor, SDO , RCO, TNG) and the MS SQL 2000 service. After the installation of the SP2 I enabled the services again but the Unicenter Service is not able to connect to the MS SQL 2000 Database anymore. The database itself is up and running and I can connect to it with the Enterprise Manager. A dbcc checkdb doesnt return any errors on the Unicenter database. The Unicenter service throws the following error messages during startup: 

It's not possible to get this kind of information with vdf. You can use esxcfg-scsidevs to get thiss kind of information assuming you're running ESX 4.0. on ex 3.x you can try to achieve something similir with esxcfg-vmhbadevs. First get a list of all VMFS volumes with their idenfitifer 

Now you can check if the VMFS Volumes are local disks or if they are SAN or iSCSI disks. I'm not sure if you see iSCSI information with the command. I'm only using local and SAN Volumes. 

Youve got the tool Distributed File System under Start -> programs -> Administrative Tools. If you dont have it (for example on Windows XP) you can download the administration tool pack from microsoft: $URL$ With the tool you can at least check the status (is the server and share online). Please clearify what exactly you want to monitor or troubleshoot. Are you experiencing some dfs related issues? There are a few key points to check: 

to the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf if it exists. I do not know how ubuntu 9.04 or 9.10 do store the blacklisted modules. 

No there is no (easy) way to stop the password from being viewed but that's not as bad as it looks. The decryption only works under the following circumstances: 

You can't run a batch script hidden if run it like this. But it's possible with a little VBS. Just execute the VBS file and it will run the Script hidden 

I compared the configuration of the SDO service and the system configuration with another server on which the Windows Server 2003 SP2 is installed and SDO is working. The configuration is the same and the same driver and software versions are used. Do you have any idea what causes the connection issue? Should I deinstall the unicenter service and make a fresh installation on the server or should I remove the Windows Server 2003 SP2? I don't want to remove the SP2 because it's a requirement for WSUS3 SP2 and I really don't want to know how many possible exploits are possible in such an old system ;-) Thank you very much and have a nice day. 

If I check the Unicenter configutation with chkmib_l the tool throws an exception and creates a small dump file. 

I think FreeNAS fits your needs. My personal opinion is that a FreeNAS is easier to set up then OpenFiler and the webinterface is more simple and easy to use and understand. The biggest disadvantage about openfiler is that the official documentation is only available if you pay for it. 

When you enable autologon in TweakUI the tool only changes a few registry keys. The first thing you should do is to check the registry keys You can find a Microsoft Knowledge base article about the automatic logon here: $URL$ 

Theoretically you should see the program name with the paramter -p and the PID. Be aware that you need root rights to display the program name of processes which arent running under your user. -p without root permissions: 

I'm using squirrelmail. It's pretty small and easy to configure. The "best" solution depends on your needs and personal taste ;-) 

How do you try to download the windows updates? I'm pretty sure you have to download the updates from the WSUS 3.0 SP2 MMC Snapin and deploy them from there. I dont think it's possible to download and install updates directly from microsoft on a server running WSUS. 

Then check your autostart folder on your client (start -> programs -> autostart). Also check the following registry keys for script or executable entries which could create the files. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run Next thing I would do is upload some of the file which appear magically on your desktop to virscan.org or a similar website to check them for infections. Also download and run the malicious software removal tool from microsoft on your client and if possible on the server. $URL$ 

I think you are using the wrong database driver for your odbc connection. MS SQL 2005 uses the SQL Native Client. Driver=SQL Native Client; UID=username; PWD=password; Server=SERVERNAME; Initial Catalog=DBNAME; You can download the setup here: $URL$ 

Below you can find more detailed information about the system and the SDO service. psinfo output (system information) 

I don't think you'll gain much performance if you split up your database into filegroups because you've only two dedicated disks and you already need one for your translogs. I wouldn't split it. 

Please check if the scripts and the directory can be read and executed by the webserver· I'm assuming you're using a lamp system. check if the permissions for the directory and scripts are set to r-x for everyone. 

Are you talking abozt a windows server and widnows workstations? Maybe you can use psexec from sysinternals: $URL$ you can exetue a command on the remote server psexec -u domain\user -p pass \\server command 

The encrypted file must be opened by the same user which created it. The encrypted file must be opened on the same computer on which it was created. 

Your descriptions lacks some details. (Zoredache mentioned it in the comment). Does this happen only with the user zchoy? or do the files also appear again and again when you log on as a differnt user? can you give us some examples of the file names? Do you work in a domain? are there some gpo's which could lead to such behaviour? Like a logon script which copies or creates the files on the desktop. Are the files on the desktop really doc files and co? are the known file types hidden? Check it with a simple dir command (open a command prompt for it): 

No your connection on the virtual Windows XP machine will not be directly available on the phyiscal Ubuntu installation. The host system (phyisical machine which is running the virtual machines) does not have access to the network connections of a VM. 

I'm not sure if you can use mass vhosts (apache2). i've never done something like this before. $URL$ What exactly do you want to achieve with this solution? 

One of our servers had a complete raid outtage and we had to reinstall it. After the reinstallation with a Windows Server 2003 SP1 CD and the upgrade to SP2 afterwards I'm not able to connect a shared network drive on the server over it's IP address. Yes, only, over it's ip... A connection over its hostname or fqdn is working. I did not try to connect to the Windows Server prior the SP2 installation. The acutal windows version is: Version 5.2 (Build 3790.srv03_sp2_gdr.100216-1301 : Service Pack 2) Here are the net use examples. The connections were made from a server in the same domain and ip subnet.
