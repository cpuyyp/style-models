While still not totally clear if the question ask for an inclined orbit or an inclined rotation, I will offer my two bits for both questions possible. Orbit First, Pluto for example - while no one yet was able to reconstruct what happened after all as far as I know - can have several major options to get his orbit after all. I can think of the possibility that he didn't start his carrier as a planet(like object) after all, but was a giant moon of one of our gas giants for some time, until... good question. But if he had a huge altitude every time his parent planet hat its closest approach to another gas giant, a tiny momentum of pull might have happened. I have to admin that this scenario is pretty unlikely, but still... At one point he might just got the notch to make him escape his parent planet after all and went off for adventures of his own. Maybe he would dwell around between Jupiter and Saturn for some time, until he get a random gravity assist (break or accelerate) that would change his orbit once more. And because its unlikely that he went in exactly at the same plane as the pushing random gas giant, he got a free of charge lift away from the planets plane after all. A wild theory, I know. Other options were named here already: a "small" celestial body like Pluto could get thrown off course by an impact, especially if this happens at his descending or ascending node (where its effect would be most effective). He could have met a rouge planet aeons ago, that stole some orbital speed away so orbit became eccentric and/or inclined. And last but not least, it could be a huge alien structure hauled to this place a long time ago; as soon as it detects ftl travel from earth, it will call in a huge artillery strike at this location because the aliens don't want us fooling around in that peaceful galaxy. Rotation To be honest, I can't offer much to this topic. Still, a huge impact may have the ability to add a minor vector to the spin, but that wont work with huge planets. Further what I will call "bowling ball effect" because I cant recall the scientific name may. A minor or major spot of heavy whatever located way outside the rotational center will cause some... well, it wont rotate as good as before. Can be supplied by random impact encounters. Now add some moons and a non circular spin and... well, maybe not. For Uranus I can offer a theory someone who claimed to be studying astronomy told me years ago. After all, even we on earth are afraid that our magnet field will shift some day. Some say this is caused by the core who think it might be a good time to change its rotation. However, because we are sitting on a pile of heavy molten stone and metal, the magnetic field alone wont be enough to have a huge impact on rotation direction. BUT if you are a piece of gas (in different forms), sudden change of the cores rotation direction may be able to pull the light stuff at the outside hard enough to make it copy your new way of spinning, just by applying magnetic forces. Chances are good that below the surface metallic hydrogen still is spinning the way it did some aeons ago. But this should cause atmospheric trouble beyond imagination... Up to this day I never heard this last theory again, so use with caution. So... happy planet spinning. Oh, you might use the universal sandbox to find out if the "from moon to planetoid with shitty orbit" explanation from me can be true; I do no have this toy sadly. 

Air Force In the Air Force, very few personnel actually enter the "battlefield" on a plane, about 95% of the personnel supporting each aircraft are ground crews, where issues of physical strength could be addressed with greater use of machines for lifting and applying strength. The number of pilots in the Air Force is sufficiently small that your recruits can be very gender atypical, e.g. in emotional and personality character, and still easily to secure in sufficient numbers. Physical strength and size aren't particularly important in pilots, and the crew portions could be adapted in size for women fairly easily. The Air Force is currently 19.1% female. A meaningful subset of the Marines are part of its own internal Air Force to which similar considerations would apply. Navy and Coast Guard Many positions in the Navy call for sailors who are actually below average relative to men generally in size, especially submarines. And, relatively few positions on a modern ship call for exceptional physical strength that could not be replaced by more intense use of machines to assist in lifting and moving things. If anything, an all female ship or submarine might more easily achieve a cohesive crew on a long deployment than a ship with only men. Most of the hand to hand combat training in the Navy is directed at sailors maintain order vis-a-vis other crew members who get unruly, and protecting ships that are docked when it is not necessary to carry lots of heavy gear over long distances on foot. The U.S. Navy is currently 18.1% female, the U.S. Coast Guard is currently 14.8% female. Army While some specialties in the Army fit the traditional stereotypes of what a soldier is, many do not. The U.S. Army is currently 14.2% female. Lots of soldiers in the Army and lots of Marines (which is currently 7.7% female) have jobs like driving supply trucks, providing medical care, maintaining equipment within forward operating bases, feeding the troops, reviewing intelligence from drones and satellites and troops in the field, and so on. In military lingo they are called "Fobbits" because they work in "forward operating bases". Certainly resources like artillery have become more accurate and have required less crew support over time, requiring fewer personnel to achieve the same military outcomes. Another role that was traditionally in the front lines and considered to require physical traits associated with men was operating a tank, even though there were maximum personnel size limitations on tanks. But, the number of tanks in the active duty force has declined greatly, because they have become less militarily useful in modern conflicts, and the tanks that remain have become more automated. Many proposals to make tanks even more automated have been rejected because they weren't a priority, but could be adopted in an all female force. New positions like drone operators also don't have very gendered demands on personnel. Neither do some quite front line positions like helicopter operators. Certainly, positions like infantry and special forces would be very strongly impacted, and how those posts in the military would change is very notable. But, those positions are a minority of the modern military, and the changes would be far less dramatic than they were in the days when infantry fought with swords rather than firearms. Analysis If one assumes that the Air Force, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the aircraft operating part of the Marines won't be much different, those components of the military, which make up about half of the U.S. military personnel, wouldn't change very much in character or capabilities. The Army and Marines would certainly be impacted more, but probably only about 1 in 3 members of those forces would be in the kinds of positions that would be impacted very much. Perhaps up to 250,000 personnel out of almost 1,355,000, or about 18% of the force would have strongly impacted by the transition in how they could or would operate. Thus, about 82% of the force wouldn't change very much, while about 18% of the force would change a lot in some of the ways discussed in other answers. How that 18% would change is very interesting, but one shouldn't overstate how representative that portion of the force is to the entire military force either. Transition Period Duration There would have to be a transition period during which men were phased out of the military and women were phased in, because lots of military skills can only be learned by doing under the supervision of people who know those skills. But, this wouldn't take terribly long because the military is constantly cycling through personnel. Much of the active duty force serves for four to eight years before returning to civilian life, ten years would be longer than average, and twenty years is about as long as a military career gets. So, over twelve to sixteen years, a very large part of the transition could be completely relatively seamlessly, without catastrophic loss of skill sets limited to experienced veterans. If there were a greater rush, an eight to ten year transition could still be manageable although it would carry higher costs particularly in the loss of skills at higher ranks where personnel turnover is not as rapid. 

So... these are vague estimates. Like said before, it depends where that space ship (and the pod) did land at the end. If you want an agency to pop up and take things in their hands, you should crash that ship somewhere you know a superior intelligence service is working and a big budget is available to spend to such agencies. Russia, China and the USA of course, Europe, India, Japan, British Commonwealth as secondaries... A global working group... oh dear, just claim Illuminates are active again. At all, they even made it into Deus Ex as a group of global rich people, so just throw together some of the more influential companies which may share a common goal and give them a Joint-Venture private security force. And for some goodwill, all your crash-events did happen close to one of their companies. Or better: right on the parking spots for their employees. But if you are after a government agency that may get in charge of the crash-site anywhere, UN and NATO may be your group of choice. Otherwise you will spend most time doing diplomacy, which can get pretty boring. If I could choose the landing-sites... I would place the pod at Antarctica and the UFO somewhere halfway between Europe and the USA - maybe at Iceland (which is not halfway, but... well) - so that every big player get the chance to be there first, while the local authorities are unlikely to be prepared for such a happening. Some of the Oceania-Islands (Java!) may be a good spot too: quite big cities available and most big players within two hours recon-plane-range. At the end... when no evidence of dead alien creatures from the inside made it to the internet, a country or company will try to claim that this is in fact an earth-bound plane which happens to... well, they shouldn't have updated their flight-computer to windows 10. Otherwise it will be a matter of hours before to much evidence is around to conceal this any more. Just take group of students with smartphones and a nearby 4G Phone Transmitter Station... I feel like I did miss something, but maybe it pop up in my mind later... or somebody else does name it. 

A plastic brick building in Columbia from here. This example is small scale, but there is no good reason that bigger blocks perhaps as big as those in the pyramids or medieval castles, but much lighter to place, couldn't be used. For example, a version of this technology developed in New Zealand can be designed to use much larger, less finely polished bricks. Imagine cubic yard sized bales of plastic turned into smooth bricks. The world is full of plastic crap that would be readily available in a post-apocalyptic world (it could be mined from landfills or gathered from floating plastic in the sea, if necessary), can often be compressed, melted and reformed into convenient shapes. This technique is used to make plastic bricks in some developed countries. Landfills are more ubiquitous than quality quarries or old growth forests which would be good in a time period when long distance transportation of low value building materials might be a problem. Also, once placed, the plastic bricks can be welded into a single solid surface with heat. And, plastic is forever. Most kinds don't biodegrade over time. Animals don't eat it. It isn't friendly to plants that could root in it. If it's thick enough it can handle rough weather. It isn't as brittle as glass or ceramic or brick which would be good in places with earthquakes (perhaps fracking induced as people chase scare hydrocarbon supplies) or major storms. Also, plastic is water proof which would be attractive in coastal areas put at risk of periodic storm surges in a world where sea levels had risen due to global warming. While the bricks in the image above are bland and gray, plastic can come in many colors and random mix of pre-apocalypse marketing driven colors could provide an ugly/beautiful aesthetic that characters could muse upon adding "local color" to the story. The (optional) aluminum or tin cover foil would prevent it from melting in the sun or from minimal stray fire exposure, but with sufficient ignition and intentionally poked holes in the metal cover it could burn. Plastic Concrete A wall made of "plastic concrete": 

Oh, you do have your accepted answer already, but I want to add something for the fluff-factor. When reading this I felt remembered of a never ending space opera from Germany: Perry Rhodan. Its pretty unknown outside the country, but still... they had there habitated rouge like planet in the year 1965 ready if I recall correctly. Its name was... the 100-sun-world. While it wasn't settled by humans, the bio-robots living there where pretty happy just a hop outside the galaxy without a central star. Guess what its pseudo-science explanation was? Right: they placed about 100 artifact mini-suns around their planet to get a neverending day and surface condition that allowed the space operas protagonist group to visit it without wearing any protective gear. So if you feel adventurous, let your guys use a similar solution. At all, there is no hard-science tag attached to your question. Oh, if someone ponder about these robots: their name where "Posbi" I think. They may still be around, because that space opera didn't come to an end until now. 

your question maybe would take better place at the astronomy-section of stackexchange... or maybe not. Anyway, while math is my enemy too, I came across such questions while programming a tool for astronomy purposes. The System First of... design a stable binary system, before you place your living beeings. There are many out there in space in reality, so its plausible to assume these can hold planets with lifeforms too. But one point creates headache at my side: you want your moons planet orbit both suns. He would orbit the... uh, what was this name... barycenter (?) of these suns in that case, getting pushed around by one of the two suns on a regular base... hell, I don't want to this planet, when it and his two central bodys form a conjunction. Here the math kicks in, and I have to fall back to speculate, that it might rip apart a big gas giant if he needs to be close enough to be inside the habitable zone of this system. But! Most binary and trinary systems don't have their suns do a close dance around each other. Prove me wrong, but I think in most cases the second sun acts as a remote planet, that happens to do stellar nucleosynthesis. So the second sun orbits the central sun faaar away - think about the oorthian cloud, or what is name was - and have to use what was left of material when the first sun collected itself. So it might be a red dwarf. Another thing - two real close dancer suns will eat each others material - the bigger one can steal stuff from the smaller one, if close enough. That might result in a pretty spontaneous combustion of the small one. But to make this work, the big one need to be pretty big (H or O class? Hmmmm... no, any class super or hyper giant may be sufficient). At least the "bright" ones tend to have pretty short lives... short enough, to go supernovae and destroy their small follow star before any life could develop. Well, I would recommend a decent stable system, where star number two is a far orbiter. Feel free to update my knowledge about this if I recalled this wrong. The Planet Big gas giant, even bigger than Jupiter? Don't go to far... let me kick my brain... but I think over 1*10^28kg of mass this thing will fuse some low level nuclearsynthesis. Other words: you might get a brown dwarf. They consume a special element I can't remember (something containing a y?), don't do what real stars do but would be much warmer than a common gas giant. Even a Jupiter size gas giant will be a bad place to orbit around. Ever heard of jupiters music? Feel free to google this :) But anyway, jupiter size gas giants may be pretty ray bursters. This may encourage evolution, but wouldn't be a pleasureful place to life for human like creatures. Okay, I may overestimate the power of the emitted rays, but that something you might think about. A planet this big will catch most stuff in its orbit. I think astronomers call this "clean its orbit". Due to many millenias every piece that came across the gas giant will be slung away. It can go away, it can become a new satellite, or it may impact your moon. When life there did grow naturally, most of these planet killing stones should have gone... but maybe not all. Oh, same count for your moon. It will clean its path, so if its an earth-like stone planet, you probably won't have any rings at this gas giant. The moon Ehm... well... you know... to get a orbital period of one earth year for a planet (moon) about the same size (and mass!) as our beloved earth, you need a earth-like orbit. So... about 150.000.000 Kilometers. If you have a sun-like star AND your gas giant inside the habitable zone, this would get... warm in summer. Very warm. Well, you moon-earth would slam inside the central sun or get catched by it in a mercury like orbit. Hm... one point I'm not sure about right now is... how much closer to its central body a satellite may come when taking the central bodys mass into account. I think you won't need the whole 150.000.000km, but... hm... 15 Million maybe. Argh, I have no access to my program here, but I think someone who can calculate this will pop up in this thread pretty soon :) Or use one of the free calculators in the internet... but to make a bet: to have an orbital period of one year for a planet of a earth like mass in 15 million kilometers semimajor axis, you would need a central body of 1/100 sun masses... that is... a brown dwarf? sigh there is a reason I need a program to guess stuff like this. whats 1.9 x 10^30 / 100 ? 1.9 x 10^28? well, that would be pretty brown dwarf, wouldn't it? But! but, but but... You want a bound rotation of your moon. That means your moon needs to be close to you gas giant. close enough, that the gravity of the gas giant can friction break your moons rotation using waves, air and even continental plates. So... this close, you will receive lovely amounts of hard em rays and get a forced orbital period of... some weeks in best. But you say "lol its magnet field would neutralize this noob"? But we need to take care of the seismic activity and vulcanism, which requires a moon with death core. Correction: a earth size planet is likely to have a liquid core very long. Even Mars and Venus should have one, Mercury... don't know. Hell, didn't the biggest of Jupiters moons claim a magnet field? It looks like all your creatures can do is embrace the natural disasters. But anyway, once rotation got bound, things will calm don I think. How to neutralize the temperature? Okay, I'm off here. If you don't want to get your moon scorched by the central sun, it should be at the outer range of the habitable zone. But... here a brown dwarf would be useful, because it does emit heat I think. So the side bound to the gas giant / brown dwarf may receive enough energy to allow liquid water, while the other side... you may install a ice princess over there. To expect what the seasons be like, I would like to wait for what moon - planet - binary sun constellation you vote at the end. Because it will matter a lot. To answer you last question... maybe. If you can accumulate enough energy from what sources available to get about the same level as we do have on earth, it may work. Get this energy from a sun, or two, a brown dwarf, an active gas giant... but don't get too much, or you get a Venus, and too less will create you a Mars. Then avoid heavy hard rays, so no blue or white central star and a peaceful gas giant. To avoid heavy changes of temperature and climate, you need to stick in a narrow piece of your habitable zone, so no wide orbits around that gas giant (needed for bound rotation too), which means you have to forfeit the six month day/night I'm afraid of. But you can give your gas giant a slight elliptical orbit, so it will bring its moon closer to the sun half of its year, which may be... well, I didn't talk about this, but if your gas giant wants to be stable, you may need orbit him in a distance that take many years for a single circuit. That would make a maya-civilization happy, because their calendar would work pretty well telling when the next "summer" will arrive. So. I'm out of words for now. And interested in your decision about this system at the end. Have a nice day Edit: Oh well, that answer in that first comment to your questions is 10^28 times better than my stuff... :( keep with that 

How did it get there? If it was assembled elsewhere, presumably the same alien means of propulsion that caused it to come to its current location could be reversed, ideally with alien allies who are converted to the cause because life on Earth is so cute. Alternately, you could land it in the Pacific Ocean where the proto-moon made a lot of room when it crashed there the last time several billion years ago, but unlike the proto-moon, you would do it very, very slowly. But for the "Its gravity causes earthquakes, tsunamis, meteor showers and all that fun stuff." and an apparently unstable orbit, I would have favored some effort to short out its systems in place leaving it inert as a second moon, such as a huge electromagnetic pulse directed towards our best estimate of the location of the control systems. Still, if you could short out its electronics with an EMP and then nudge the inert death star further from Earth to the points where the tidal effects of its gravity on earth were reduced, that would be good. 

The problem with wireless charging is technical and not economic. The amount of money necessary to buy the electrical juice necessary for something like that is trivial. An iPhone6 uses a little less than 50 cents (U.S.) of electricity per year (about 1 U.S. cent of electricity per phone per week). If people just charged cell phones and there were 5,000 people in your little town, the electricity cost of providing free phone charging to everyone in the town would be about $200 a month. You could finance this program by having local school kids recycle can or look under seat cushions in public places for loose change. Hell, it is common right now to let people charge their electric cars for free in public parking lots. The problem is that when you are transmitting energy through the air, the highly energetic EM fields are likely to be harmful to you, unlike a radio wave which is so low powered that it is hardly more harmful than background radiation. Essentially, a wireless recharging connection is like shooting a high powered laser beam or high powered X-ray (or gamma ray) from the wireless charging source to your device in more or less a straight line. At a minimum this would drastically increase cancer risks for everyone in the vicinity. In a worst case scenario, people would get painfully zapped and it might start fires as well. Wires have insulation for a reason, and you can't insulate the wireless transfer of power associated with a more than de minimus range wireless charger. Usually, today, wireless chargers rely on induction of fields between two objects that are basically touching, so there is no danger zone between them that can hurt the users.
