I would like to know if there can be some kind of classification of normal rational surfaces with Gorenstein singularities, such that their canonical divisor is effective. Additional question. Are there such surfaces at all? I could imagine constructing such a surface by blowing up several points on an elliptic curve in $\mathbb CP^2$ and then contracting the proper transform of the curve, but will this give an example? 

Is it true that every projective sub-variety of degree $d$ in $\mathbb CP^n$ is an intersection of some number of hypersurfaces of degree $d$? Is there some simple proof of this fact? (I believe this is so) 

Yes, it is, of course, true. Even though foliations defined by $q$ are not orientable, the genus $2$ surface is orientable, so an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of a closed geodesic $\gamma$ is just the cylinder $\gamma\times [-\varepsilon, \varepsilon]$. This statement holds more generally for orientable surfaces with flat metric and conical singularities. If you find a simple closed geodesic (smooth one and disjoint from conical points) its $\varepsilon$-neighborhood is a cylinder. 

Consider $\mathbb C^n$ with coordinates $(z_1,\dots,z_n)$, $z_j=x_j+iy_j$. Let $\omega=\sum dx_i\wedge dy_i$. Let us call by a radial diffeomorhpism $\varphi$ of $\mathbb C^n$ a diffemorphism of $\varphi:\mathbb C^n\to \mathbb C^n$ that sends any $z\in \mathbb C^n$ to $f(|z|)\cdot z$, where $f$ is a smooth positive function on $\mathbb R^+$. Question. Let $\varphi$ be a radial diffeomorphism of $\mathbb C^n$. Is it true that $\varphi^*(\omega)$ is a $(1,1)$-form on $\mathbb C^n$? I think I can prove the above statement but find it a bit surprising, since the diffeo $\varphi$ is of course not a bi-holomorphism unless $f$ is constant. I would be grateful for a short proof /reference/ or a counterexample for this statement. 

I would like to know if the following statement (or a more general version of it) is contained in some book or article: Statement. Let $(U,g)$ be a complex manifold with a Kahler metric $g$ and let $x\in U$ be a point. Let $U_x\subset U$ be a neighborhood of $x$ and $h$ be a Kahler metric on $U_x$. Then there is a smaller neighborhood $U_x'\subset U_x$ of $x$, and a metric $g'$ on $U$, such that $g'=h$ in $U_x'$ and $g'=g$ in $U\setminus U_x$. I can prove this statement using regularized maximum, but would be grateful for a reference. 

Here is a definition of holomorphic convexity taken from the notes of Eyssidieux: Defintion. A complex analytic space $S$ is holomorphically convex if there is a proper holomorphic morphism $\pi: S\to T$ with $\pi_*O_S=O_T$ such that $T$ is a Stein space. $T$ is then called Cartan-Remmert reduction of $S$. Questions. 1) Is this correct that Cartan-Remmert reduction is unique is if exists? 2) Do I understand correctly, that (assuming properness of $\pi$) $\pi_*O_S=O_T$ just means that $\pi$ is a surjective map and all its fibers are connected? 

Was it proven already that smooth rational complex projecitve varieties are symplectically rationally connected? I.e. some GW invariant with two point insertions is non zero. What about smooth toric varieties? 

It is well known that compact manifolds of negative sectional curvature don't admit self-maps of degree $>1$. At the same time positively curved manifolds such as $S^n$ and $\mathbb CP^n$ clearly admit self-maps of degree $>1$. Moreover I guess if we take a compact Lie group and consider map $x\to x^2$ the degree of such map is $>1$ (in fact I did not check it). Question. Let $G$ be a compact Lie group and $H$ its proper connected Lie subgroup. Is it true that $G/H$ admits self-maps of degree $>1$? If not, is there some classification of such quotients and that admit / don't admit a self-map with $deg>1$? 

I would like to know if the following statement is correct. Statement. Let $X$ be a normal projective variety with $Pic(X)=\mathbb Z+torsion$. Let $L$ be an ample line bundle on $X$ and let $D$ be an effective $\mathbb Q$-Cartier divisor in $X$. Consider the projective cone $C$ over $X$ corresponding to $L$. Then the cone over $D$ in $C$ is a $\mathbb Q$-Cartier divisor as well. Is this true? Note that for $X=\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$, $L=O(1)\boxtimes O(1)$, and $D$ equal to a $\mathbb P^1$ fiber the statement does not hold. So the condition $Pic(X)=\mathbb Z+torsion$ is important. 

I have to grade a master project on representations of symmetric groups (char $0$) third time in my life and finally I came to a conclusion that I have to get a grasp of the matter. I am aware of plenty of sources on the topic, such as Lecture 4 in Fulton Harris, but to my shame I don't find these sources user-friendly (far too many things left unproved). So here is a question: Are you aware of some nice sources on representations of symmetric group (in char $0$) that are user friendly? Maybe some online videos? This topic seems to be really beautiful, with huge amount of applications and connections to other bits of maths, so I believe there must be somewhere something pedagogical and user-friendly... 

Let $X$ be a complex projective manifold and $E$ and $F$ be holomorphic vector bundles on $X$. The extensions of $F$ by $E$ are classified by elements $e\in H^1(E\otimes F^*)$. On the other hand, for any non-zero $\alpha \in \mathbb C$ the extension bundles corresponding to classes $e$ and $\alpha e$ are isomorphic. Main question. Is is possible to construct a universal extension triple $$0\to {\cal E}\to {\cal W}\to {\cal F}\to 0$$ over $\mathbb P(H^1(E\otimes F^*))\times X$ such that for any $0\ne e\in H^1(E\otimes F^*)$ the restriction of $0\to \cal E\to \cal W\to \cal F\to 0$ to $[e]\times X$ was the extension of $F$ by $E$ corresponding to $[e]$. Question 2. If such a universal family exists, what can one say about the family of restriction bundles $\cal E_x, \cal W_x, \cal F_x$ over $\mathbb P(H^1(E\otimes F^*))\times x$ parametrized by points of $X$. For example, what are their Chern classes? 

Suppose that $X$ is a complete intersection of quadrics in $\mathbb P^n_{\mathbb C}$. Is there some straightforward procedure to resolve the singularities of $X$? For example, can one stratify singularities $X_{\rm sing}\subset X$ by some strata $X_1\subset X_2\subset \cdots \subset X_k=X_{\rm sing}$ so that $X$ can be resolved in $k$ steps by blowing consequently proper transforms of $X_i$, starting with blowing up $X$ in $X_1$? 

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Consider the family of extensions $$0\to O(-n)\to E\to O(n)\to 0,$$ parameterized by $H^1(O(-2n))$. For each element $e\in H^1(O(-2n))$ we get a rank two bundle $E$ that is of the form $O(-k)\oplus O(k)$ with $0\le k\le n$. Generic $E$ is isomorphic to $O\oplus O$. Question. How to describe the stratification on $H^1(O(-2n))$ according to various $k$? Is there some nice reference working out this example? 

I would like to know if there is an explicit example of a finitely presented group that can not be realised as the (topological) fundamental group of a normal complex quasi-projective variety? 

For the purposes of teaching my elementary course in algebraic geometry I am looking for a reference (or notes) that contains a complete proof of a higher-dimensional weak Bezout theorem. I only want to learn about a proof that is based on the approach when dimensions and degrees of projective varieties are introduced via Hilbert polynomials. Weak Bezout. Let $F_1,...,F_n$ be homogeneous polynomials of degrees $d_1,...,d_n$ such that hypersurfaces $F_1=0$,..., $F_n=0$ have only finite number of intersections in $\mathbb P^n_K$ (with $K$ algebraically closed). Then the number of intersections is at most $d_1\cdot...\cdot d_n$. Justification of the question. Of course there is a large amount of proofs of this statement in many books on algebraic geometry (Shafarevich, Harris, Hasset, ect.) but these proofs usually come after 200 pages of text, while I want an honest proof that is contained in a complete set of notes of 40 pages (this will be the maximal length of my notes and I don't want to spend more than 10 pages on higher dimensional Bezout). Also these proofs often develop dimension theory basing on transcendence degree of the field of rational functions and I don't want to use this approach, (since it will require 2-3 additional lectures which I don't have time to give). I know one place where the approach that I want to use (namely everything is based on Hilbert polynomials) is taken, these are the notes of Manin (end of 60ties). Unfortunately it seems to me that there is a problem with the proof he proposes. Basically everything works if $F_1,...,F_n$ form a regular sequence, but to understand why in the condition of the theorem $F_1,...,F_n$ do form a regular sequence is left in the notes as something "not hard to do"... In the book of Hasset, it seems to me there is a similar problem (i.e. it is not explained why $F_1,...,F_n$ form a regular sequence if the number of intersections of hypersurfaces is finite). I hope there is a nice complete proof somewhere... In other words, what will completely satisfy me is a short proof of the following statement: If the number of intersections of $F_i=0$ is finite, then $F_i$ form a regular sequence. Is there a short proof of this statement? PS. I think that the answer of Sandor shows that probably there is no "magic easy" solution to the question (if one sticks to Hilbert polynomial approach instead of using higher-dimensional resultants), so I decided to accept it.
