I understand that you are upset that a co-worker buggered up and lied to implicate you (apparently getting away with it), but if there is no proof I would not expect for the company to necessarily do anything visible to you. The fact you felt they believed you and you did not receive a reprimand yourself is an indication. In the other cases you mention involving minorities (and the majority of the work force) there may have been no doubt about where responsibility was, or the worker was honest and owned up to it, so reprimands were easy to dispense. You might want to ask your manager privately and verbally about the situation, if you are on good terms. They may be building a case to dismiss the person for all you know. Going to a hotline or HR and crying discrimination is really a nuclear option. You can be pretty sure they have written documentation to cover each of the reprimands - you could easily be on thin ice in trying to prove a negative. 

Write the information in a Word document and print it 'n' times. It doesn't have to look like a card. Print it on pink paper or whatever if you want it to stand out. I would not go about designing my own business card without documented permission, companies can get snippy about that sort of thing- technically you'd be violating copyright on their logo, for example. 

If you are applying for TN status, you should make sure you have the required fee and documentation (including an appropriate letter from the employer) at the border inspection, otherwise you're not going to be admitted. 

If your employment contract does not prohibit it, then it comes down to the laws in your jurisdiction, local culture and any other restrictions. For example, licensed professionals may be required to adhere to a code of ethics that prohibits such 'moonlighting' activities without written knowledge of all parties, even if their personal ethical standards and laws applicable to the general workforce would permit it. 

I have also encountered employers who preferred to hire only bad credit risks, as those people were too desperate to keep working, and so the boss could apply all sorts of pressure to them. Anyone who was not in dire financial straits would quit. Sometimes legal regulations change and previously acceptable past history becomes retroactively unacceptable: 

If they ask, let them bring it up. All the places I've left, I've left for large raises that they cannot and would not match. 

One previous employer would routinely send QA and developers to tradeshows where the company had a booth. One of the difficulties with "shrinkwrap" business software is that the folks writing the software don't always know their customers (in this case, accountants and actuaries). So for this company, it was helpful to get the techies out to learn how the users actually used the product. 

As you have described it, this person is very effective at managing how others perceive him. I would start documenting carefully his assignments, and lack of delivery. If he is a developer, you should be able to get statistics from your source code control system of his check-ins. Morning stand-up meetings will make it crystal clear among your team that he's goofing off. This will not address his managing perceptions to managers outside your group. One book to read is Snakes In Suits. Some of what you've written remind me very much of this book. 

In the banking industry in the US, letting your boss know you are looking for another job can get you fired immediately. One bank I worked for monitored phone lines (and bathrooms) and if you were overheard to be looking for another job, the security department would have your boss and an armed guard at your desk the next morning to help you pack your things and leave. While this bank is an outlier, the doctrine of "at will employment" in the US means that giving your employer "too much notice" can result in you being fired. In the US, 2 weeks notice is customary when resigning. It is reasonably common enough that when you give your notice that you will be immediately escorted from the premises, so that informing supervisors that you are "looking" can be very risky. It is my experience in the US that you should have all your personal possessions out of the office before giving notice. 

You're describing how much of a machine you are. Instead, focus on the output you created! For instance, instead of studying 80 hours per week, describe what you learned. Describe the projects you finished and the difference they made. Describe the research you did and what you learned, and why you were interested in that subject. Get to your motivations and the output you created. I realize that, as a freshman, you may not have a long list of stories to tell. That's likely okay, since you're applying for an internship and not an experienced position - but if you really focus on it, I'm sure you'll come up with plenty. 

How fluid is the workforce in terms of switching positions? Do managers generally have no problem with departmental transfers, or is it looked poorly upon? Is there an official probation period or any other policy that constrains moves? Do you need to include HR in these discussions? Do you need to follow an official process of applying for the role? 

Honestly, I don't think it should matter what the other employees make. Salary (or, total compensation) is about what the company finds valuable about an individual's contributions. If your manager is saying he won't pay you more (or otherwise increase your total compensation, ie bonuses, vacation days, benefits, etc) because of X, where X isn't your individual contribution, you need to just redirect and make it about your individual contribution. All other X's are just decoys and distractions (perhaps unintentionally on your manager's part, to be fair). Think of it this way. Every time he gives you a sentence as an attempt to justify your salary, take out his reason and stick "for your skill set and contribution" into the sentence, because that's exactly what he's implying: 

Which brings us to the most significant point in your question: Are you actually upset about your own (minor?) underpaid status, or are you upset about your perception of your brother-in-law's overpaid status? If you're upset about your own status, do something about it. If you're upset about his status, get over it. 

I usually inform the immediate supervisor early in the day, after the morning status meeting. Beforehand, I try to have all my personal possessions out of the office: some companies (especially in the finance industry) will escort you to the door as soon as you give notice, others will want you to work through your notice period. I also try to have a written resignation letter handy. Based on past experience, resignation letters should be 3 and only 3 sentences. 

I did this at a previous job and was dinged badly on my performance review one year for doing so. I was able to make some small and minor changes in our development process but those drove my boss crazy. That boss is trying to get me to come back and save their bacon, and of the folks who quit in the past 2 years (the other guys who quit had been there 10 +/- 2 years), some will never come back, one is already back and the boss is balking at trying to match what I'm making now. The new CEO has made some changes in policies - and these new policies have the potential to make things turn around. Simple things like a wiki (to keep track of developer knowledge) and setting up a build machine (to make builds repeatable) are well within the ability to do them as evenings and weekends projects and then present them as fait accompli. I had been there for 5 years and I was the short timer - everyone else had been there for 8-18 years. All of the business and domain knowledge was trapped in people's heads and there wasn't a way to store it to preserve it; when several key developers quit in the past 2 years , a huge amount of that knowledge was irretrievably lost. There are some studies on the conflict between status-seeking bosses and employees who want to help improve things, one of which is Reversing the Extroverted Leadership Advantage: the Role of Employee Proactivity. From the study: 

While there are lots of cases of actual "toxic" environments or bosses, there are also lots of other reasons why things become toxic. The problem is, it's hard for an interviewer to determine if you called the prior environment "toxic" because: 

How much is your good work-life balance worth to you? How do you compare (in performance) to others in your position in this company? What is your employer's process for raises/promotions? (some employers don't offer off-cycle raises, you may need to move to a higher-graded position to get a raise). 

Ask for clarification before you begin the work. This can be simple: "Hey boss, would you like to review A or B at steps X, Y, or Z?" Give him options, don't just say "what do you want" or "what should I do." Ideally, put this in an email, and mention it if you're doing a daily standup or any other kind of regular work review. If he answers, acknowledge the answer and then do it. If he doesn't answer, or gives conflicting advice, default to the more-communicative option. If this is a conflict about which things to review, then present him with an opportunity to review each thing, as appropriate. Yes, this may seem like overkill, but you're giving him the benefit of the doubt, and it doesn't have to halt all work. If he goes along with this, great. If he doesn't... If he corrects you (ie asks for more/less review opportunities) then - right there in the moment - ask for clarity on the future. "Ok boss, I'll make sure you have a chance to review X. On our future tasks, would you always like to review step X? Or is this a one-time review?" This way, you're putting the ball in his court and establishing an expectation of how you will behave in the future, so you don't have to repeat this whole process again.
