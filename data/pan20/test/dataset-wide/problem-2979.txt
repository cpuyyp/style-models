I think you've unwittingly asked two different questions with two different answers. I'll explain, but first, let's talk definitions. "Qualia" is a technical term, so you'd think it'd have a clear, agreed-upon definition (that's usually the point of technical terminology). Unfortunately, it's actually used to mean several slightly different things. The following definitions capture the uncontroversial basics of what most people are talking about when they talk about qualia, but keep in mind that sometimes there's more built into the word's definition. When different assumptions are built into the term, it leads to all sorts of semantic debates. Ned Block, a well-known philosophy of mind specialist, wrote this short but useful paper on relevant controversies. Common definitions of "qualia" include: 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

Nobody knows what Plato wrote on because no originals survive. However, papyrus was the standard at the time of Plato. You can check out some examples here. Leather was also used for writing in his time, but parchment probably wasn't popular until at least couple hundred years later. It's worth noting that parchment wasn't simply invented on a particular date. It was gradually developed in stages over a long period of time. Different treatments of animal skin were used for writing and had been for thousands of years before Plato. There's a good chance ancient Greeks, Plato included, had access to something like parchment. 

In the United States, Donald Trump's election has been all the rage, and his Tweets and public declarations have received much attention, especially those that accuse CNN and the "liberal media" in general for being "fake news." Prima facie, this is an attempt to refuse facts for the sake of an agenda. However, these people who cry "fake news" may be on to something; while it might seem to be easy to justify the epistemological validity of news coverage, the problem ultimately boils down to the justification of hearsay: "I asked the man in the airport where the bathroom was, and I trusted him" is of a similar form as "I saw on The Washington Post that Scaramucci made some vulgar comments about Steve Bannon, and I believed it." Here's my main question: What is the epistemic justification for knowledge by news/hearsay? Is there a specific epistemological problem for this, and if so, what is it called? 

The properties or characteristics of sense-data. As a philosophic term, "qualia" was first used by C. I. Lewis to refer to properties of sense-data (via IEP), so this is the original definition. Amy Kind defines qualia as "subjective or qualitative properties of experiences," what gives an experience its characteristic "feel" and what distinguishes them from each other. Examples include the sensations of pain, hunger, and itching, as well as what it feels like to be angry or anxious (IEP). Daniel Dennett (a famous philosopher who writes about qualia) once defined qualia as "the ways things seem to us" (via Wikipedia) but has used other definitions at other times (SEP). Ned Block gives the following basic/initial definition: "Qualia include the ways things look, sound and smell, the way it feels to have a pain, and more generally, what it's like to have experiential mental states" Michael Tye defines "qualia" as "the introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental lives" (SEP). Tye gives a useful breakdown of 4 more specific uses of "qualia" in his SEP article, including a helpful explanation of the different definitions that Lewis, Dennett, and Block use (SEP). 

I think a possible solution might not lie in the truth or our knowledge of the truth of theory-laden theories or hypotheses as much as in their usefulness. Even if everything might be theory-laden, we still get magnificent results from the application of science. Although we can't claim with certainty to have knowledge or knowledge of the truth of phenomena, we can still make predictions and inventions for the sake of their products. In this light, then, we might be able to refute the anti-vaxxer or climate change denier by comparing his predictions and according results with a credible scientist's predictions and according results; the conceptual scheme that made more accurate predictions than the other would then qualify as "better" (albeit not "true"). Then, depending on how inaccurate the results turned out, we should reject the science-denier's theory/hypotheses on the grounds that it would simply be not worth our time. Alternatively, if the anti-science advocate's policies were enacted and harm arose from it, e.g. more and more children would begin to die of polio, then we could use these adverse effects as justification to reject their theory. To put it more simply, we should only accept the scientific community's conclusions on climate change or vaccines if they are more useful to believe. I'm more confident with this solution in the context of the natural sciences, but I would think it would still be applicable in social and political issues as well. Intuitively, I would respond that the relativism of social and political issues could be avoided if we only accepted falsifiable hypotheses, but that solution is obviously off the table. I'm no scholar, and I'm not sure if Quine or Kuhn or any of those you mentioned would even espouse this view, but I still think it is relevant and doesn't clash with theory-laddenness assumptions. 

Here's one answer from a relatively authoritative source. Antonis Coumoundouros, a specialist in ancient philosophy, says the Republic has been Platoâ€™s most famous and widely read dialogue since the mid-nineteenth century (see $URL$ However, lamentably, he doesn't provide any evidence in that article. EDIT: I emailed him for more information. He filled in a few details about why it re-emerged at that time: "As far as I can tell, the dialogue became quite popular in England in the 19th century. My guess is that its subject matter (discussion of justice, virtue, and proper education) was concordant with the type of education provided to young elites at the time. This carried over into the 20th century and we had Cornford and others who produced commentaries on it. Other English-speaking countries, like the US, maintained the dialogue's popularity in universities as well. It is worth noting that the dialogue was lost to the West until the Renaissance. Arab scholars had access to it and were influenced by it in the Middle Ages but western scholars did not have access to it. "
