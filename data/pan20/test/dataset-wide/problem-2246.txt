Since you get a lot of wind skiing you need to break the wind. And you don't need as much breath-ability. But in sunny conditions you can get away with a bit. You are not going to have a lot of speed your first time skiing. I just saw you live in Houston. If you just have a soft shell for local weather then get a hard shell. At like Academy or an army surplus you can decent shell / rain jacket for $80. A pair heavy wool pants will work fine. 

You did slow his fall. Assume 15 meters of rope to the top then 12 meters back to him for a total of 27 meters. Stretch = 3/27 = 1/9. So just over 10%. And that assumes no slack in the line. When you are top roping you can use a less stretchy rope as there should be not dynamic type falls where you need the stretch. 

At best the volume of the flotation needs to be the volume of the water. So if the flotation was 1/2 the volume of the boat and the boat and flotation weighed nothing the boat full (1/2) the water line would be 1/2 way up the boat. Add your gear and bike not sure you would not still sink it. Where does not matter. The volume will displace water. You would need like the volume in that white water picture and then you don't have room for gear. There is no way for you to toss a loaded canoe in open water and right it with no water. In video is a very fit looking man barely tossing a very light canoe. And you state you cannot even enter a dry canoe without flooding it. A white water canoe ride wet is about 60%+ flotation for a reason. You would need the much or more to have a have a boat you could paddle flooded. And at that volume you don't have room for your gear. A sail boat has a much different design for a reason. Wide gunwale so you can empty the cockpit on on righting. Even with optimal design a sail boat is about 80% flotation to a achieve and open water recovery. I get you don't want to get a sail boat. The point is the even with optimal design it requires about 80% flotation. Canoe sail in water, with no solid keel, and no wide gunwale I don't think you are going to right in open water without flooding it even with same ratio of flotation. Without fixed keel you do not even have the leverage even if you have the flotation. If you are going to sail it then I would advise you stay close to shore where you can swim it in and recover on shore. On solid ground could push the mast and then bail. Part of the question is "or if I have a sail I can get it upright and get in." Starting with a canoe I do not think you are going to get there with any amount flotation. Min width on small sail boat that you can open water recover seems to be about 4'. And you say that is too wide to trailer. Single handed sail in no wind can pump the sail, rock the rudder, or drop the sail sit on the bow and paddle. Two handed drop the sail and sit on the gunwales and paddle. In my opinion a small sail boat paddles better than a canoe sails. I get you don't want to go that path. 

Unless your dogs are well behaved (will sit on a single command and not move) then address the dogs and distract them. Grab them by the collar. If the people don't bother you then the dogs are not likely to be bothered. If the dogs will sit then leash them and order them to sit to the trail side. I don't see a need or benefit to engage the people other than hello. You want to teach the dogs that trail people are of no concern. 

This is more of a road experience for a rural area in Washington state. Near a lake a group of pet dogs (all had nice collars) would form a pack during the day and liked to chase bikes. On flat ground I could outrun them. I carried pepper spray but was hesitant to use it. One day they caught me on an up hill and the pack leader turned his head to chop on my leg. As that point his intentions were clear. I got him clean in both eyes with pepper spray and he never bothered me again. Bike or foot from bark to bite you will typically see them prepare to bite. Have pepper spray or other defense ready. Walking a walking stick / pole is good defense. Try and remain calm and proceed with a look of confidence. If you show fear is when they get more aggressive. This a set of dogs that were probably not going to hurt the guy but no one should have to deal with that. dogs farm road 

Boiling alone is very effective the problems that is takes a lot of time. You pretty much need to do it at camp. Another factor is filtered water tastes better. Chemicals make the water taste worse. Have a filter (or one of the other options) for when you need water on the trail. Leaving camp with 3 liters of water is 6.5 lbs. Viruses are rarely found in North American wilderness waters. As for heavy metals. If there are heavy metals in the water then not reason to go hiking there. Heavy metals are not naturally occurring in the wilderness. Bring a collapsible water bucket for camp so you don't have to multiple trips. 

Pitch the tent flat. If not flat then most people prefer feet down hill. You may prefer feet up. Lay down and decide what you what. Most people sleep head at the opening. Across the grade you roll - not good. I like feet down hill and head at the opening so opening up hill. 

I would simply go by the loft. More specifically the minimum loft. If some baffles have blown out the bag is not as effective. I don't have source but I read lumberjacks that use the bag year round go for 3-4 years. If you lose some loft you can just use it as a heavy summer bag. 

Not perfect but double sock. First layer (liner) is a smooth thin sock designed to slide. Outer sock is the thicker insulation layer. 

I own both a 3 season tent and 4 season. I car camp in warm weather all the time with my 4 season tent because it is bigger. Once you unzip the door you get a lot of ventilation. 

That link lists it as a 1-2 day hike. If you are slow definitely a 2 day hike. And it says night time temperature can get near freezing. Sleep under the stars is what you hope for. If it is cloudy and rainy no tent could be life threatening. Once it gets dark it is pretty hard to build any make shift shelter. A tarp you can all get under but that could still be a very miserable night. Don't know when you are leaving. Check the actual weather forecast. 

The math is trigonometry but I think you would need to get a feel. It is not like you could run the math on the fly anyway. The ratio of sin above and the sin below is 1.33. More angle is more bend. At perpendicular there is zero bend. At 45 about 13 degree of bend. At 45 degrees if the fish looked like a depth of 2' you would need to aim like 7" below by my calculation. You still have to guess how deep the fish looks. Multiply how deep it looks by 1.33. The best thing would be to set up a string and a target and practice. The spear is also going to push off when it enters the water so need to account for that. 

Local wind will vary and settle and night. If you have a storm moving in or big body of water then would will get persistent breeze. Near dusk drop some grass a few time and see it is consistent. 

I use 3mm utility cord around my neck. I tie in key with a Girth Hitch. Or tie the key into the necklace. I use a double fisherman on the cord. 

Glued is the least serviceable sole. A goodyear welting is designed to be resoled. Many glued soles can be replaced. On that sole I don't even think it can be bought from Vibram because of the toe cap. I tried with a similar sole on a pair of Keen and was told no even by Keen. See Vibram Sole Factor Even with glued models that can be resoled I have found the whole shoe is shot before you wear out the sole and the resole was 1/2 the price of the shoe. Caro sandals can be resoled but I find them on sale for the price of resole. 

The gel coat is cracked. It is appropriate to patch the gel coat. As long as the fiber glass stays wet it is just going to get softer. Take down the gel coat enough to expose some fiber glass and get a smooth edge. Get the fiber glass dried out and then seal (with gel coat). 

If you want to make Coghlan's you can get the ingredients from the MSDS. But that seems kind of extreme. 

Not following your logic here. You seem to assert if we don't have a record of the knot failing then safe to lash up old gear. There are newer designs. Hardware fatigues. The knot is not the only point of failure. Just because a water knot is still taught does not mean there is not something better for certain situations? It is tool / knowledge any climber needs. It is not just about the knot. Designs have change to doubling up at highest points of failure. You may have the same level of safety but at a lighter weight. Technology improves. If you think safety of older technology is fine for your risk profile then that is your choice. A 20 year old bike is good enough - the newer bikes are a lot better. A car today is safer than a car 20 years ago. For you to assert a friend should last a life time is silly. Aluminum fatigues. Springs fatigue. Modern design is far advanced over the original friends. No way I would use some of my aluminum carabiner from the 70's. Webbing has not changed much and the water knot seems to be pretty solid. Ropes have changed. There is some discussion and research on WHAT IS THE STRONGEST RAPPEL KNOT. But it is reported failure is way beyond a fall. Early Friend. Not as versatile and would walk on you so sometimes you did not get them back. I would not use any of my original friends even on a practice route. Modern friend 

If you know someone that has done the route recently to tell no problems then OK. Fast water above your knees in the dark is not a good combination. 

Not going to strengthen much in two weeks. But you can get your back and shoulders used to weight and fit of the pack. I would go for as many short to long hikes as you can and would not overload the pack as you don't want to strain your back. Take a few short hikes with a full weight load at about the 1 week mark to see how things feel. 

The density (weight) affects ballistics. Less dense shot will slow down at a faster rate. Lead is a relatively cheap high density metal but is has negative health consequences. Tungsten is dense but it is expensive. Steel is commonly used now and is less dense than lead. Wind resistance is only dependent on size and velocity. A heavier shot has more inertia so the same wind resistance will slow it less. the equation is drag = mass * acceleration acceleration = drag / mass Lead is also relatively soft. There is concern gun barrels designed for lead may be scratched by steel. 

You need to include winter to summer but based on your latitude the sunlight has to pass through a different distance of the atmosphere at dawn and dusk. Maybe this is what Botsford is saying. Circumfrance of earth at the equator is about 25,000 miles. When the sun passes over the equator the circumference at 45 degree towards the sun is about .7 that of the equator. So the sun has .7 the atmosphere to pass through and get filtered. 45 degrees is like Chicago. 

Rolling around is forced convection. Down also reduces conductive and radiant heat loss. They also put insulation between the studs in a house. 

They typically don't overlap. One factor is safety of not having both on the playing field at the same time. Another factor is give the archer a better chance. Deer are not stupid. They hear bang and they go into hiding and go high (if they have high ground). You can scout two weeks prior to hunting season and see lot of deer. Once gun season starts they are a lot harder to find. Where I grew up the game department would break up large herds by plane prior to gun season but would leave them be for early bow season.
