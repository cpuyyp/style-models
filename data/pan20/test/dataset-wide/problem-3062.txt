The Jewish population was not expelled in 70. At least Josephus, our the main source on that war does not say this. Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Temple was robbed, burned and closed (closed few years after the siege). He also mentions that lands belonging to the Jews were confiscated. But he does not say that population was expelled. 

Examples are medieval sieges, when a small defending force could stand against a large besieging army for long time, sometimes for several years. In the modern (20 century) wars encirclement is always a disadvantage because modern armies need enormous amount of supplies to continue fighting. For this reason an encircled army cannot hold for long time. EDIT. In this WWII Disney movie, Alexander de Seversky makes exactly this argument on the strategic level: Germany surrounded by the allies has advantage of short communication lines. But the ideas of this movie are highly controversial: $URL$ Especially minutes 40-45. 

"Devastating" is not the only characteristic which makes a weapon useful. Already ancient Romans experimented with repeating ballistae, but there is no evidence of their use in battles. A weapon must be convenient and handy to use, and transport, and there are many other characteristics which make a weapon useful. There are many similar examples in history. Type "Dardanelles gun" on Goolge or Wikipedia to see a picture of a Turkish 15 century cannon. You can imagine how devastating it was. But this type of weapon was soon displaced by much smaller guns. 

I am a Russian speaker who read the book, and many reviews of this book. Most reviews label it as anti-semitic. Its main point is to justify or acquit all Russian actions with respect to the Jews. And to shift the blame on the Jews whenever he can. I would not recommend this as a book on the history of Jews in Russia. On my opinion, the book is of interest from the point of view of history of the Russian chauvinist thought. For the early (before the mid 19th century) history, I recommend Leskov, Jews in Russia (there is an English translation). I intentionally choose a "genuine Russian" author (and quite famous and respected), who is not related in any way to the Jews. 

Romans brought wine. Before that the people of Northern Europe drank some kind of beer. Even in the Roman times the imported wine was expensive. 

This kind of question cannot really have an answer. Below is an extended comment. First of all, it is not clear how cost efficiency of a weapon can be calculated or estimated. Number of killed/wounded per dollar (mark)? This does not take into account the psychological effect. The Germans had no other mean to bomb London in 1944, when they already lost air superiority. So if bombing London was a priority, they had no other way to do this effectively. Weapons efficiency can be only compared when there are several different weapons which can achieve the same goal. Second 0.8% of GDP is a very large amount. And most of it was not spent "as an average over the war years" but in the last year. 

Actually there is an English translation of Maimonides: $URL$ See also this paper which discusses the technical details: $URL$ EDIT2. There is no evidence that Babylonians (or Jews, or anyone else before the Greeks) tried to answer the question "how the Moon REALLY moves?" They only addressed VISIBLE phenomena. And the conjunction of Sun with Moon is never visible, except at the time of a solar eclipse. Geometric models of celestial motion are Greek invention. Early attempts do construct such space models did not survive to our time, almost all we know about Greek astronomy comes from Ptolemy. Theoretical constructions of Babylonians also did not survive. All we have are numerical tables of visible phenomena from which we try to reconstruct the method of composing such tables. The average length of the Lunar month was known to the Babylonians with high precision, and this number (29 days 12 hours 44 1/3 minutes) was incorporated into Jewish calendar in 499 bc. But sometimes the lunar month is 29 days and sometimes 30, and the ancients were very far from being able to explain the pattern. 

It is not possible to give a short answer: the question is too complicated (and somewhat controversial). There are several good books which address it in depth. I can recommend three of them which try to answer this question: Azar Gat, War in Human Civilization, Oxford 2006, Lawrence Keeley, War Before Civilization. Oxford University Press, USA, 1996 Ian Morris, War! What is it good for? (Farrar,...NY, 2014). 

Oil was cited as one of the reasons, it is hard to judge whether it was "one of the main reasons" or not. But this was not the oil of Caucasus, this was Romanian oil. The problem was that after wrestling a part of Romanian territory in 1940, Soviet army was in close striking distance from Romanian oil fields, and the Germans felt vulnerable.This point is explicitly stated in the German declaration of war: $URL$ Now, there is a strong evidence that Soviet Union was preparing to attack Germany earlier or later, only the timing is disputed. So the oil question was certainly one of the considerations. Speaking of Caucasus oil, this was certainly not a priority in 1941. The decision to move to Caucasus was made much later, after the German defeat near Moscow. And the main reason was not taking this oil for Germany but depriving the Soviet Union of Caucasian oil. 

The reason was very simple. There were two Germanies. Soviet Union would veto the Federal Republic joining. (From the Soviet point of view it was illegitimate). For exactly the same reasons US, England and France would veto the German Democratic republic. They could only join when they (and all others) recognized each other as independent states. (Moscow treaty, 1970). Somewhat similar situation existed with PRC and Republic of China (Taiwan) for some time. (Until 1971 RC represented the whole China in UN, but now it is PRC, and RC is not a member). 

Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by his close associates (either wife or his half-brother, according to various theories) during his life time calls him Willelm, Wilgelm Normanno Duc, Willem Duc, etc., but never the "Conqueror". 

Switching to Latin alphabet does not really mean making all nation suddenly illiterate as statistics show (see the reference in the end). But of course this was a very radical measure, I agree, and a part of Westernization/modernization project. One of Kemal's goal was to decrease the role of religion and religious education; to separate literacy from religious education. I suppose this was a very effective measure from this point of view. There were few similar cases in history. When communists came to power in Russia at approximately the same time, they had similar projects of switching from Cyrillic to Latin. They did not implement it for various reasons, but later they forced other nations of Soviet Union to switch to Cyrillic alphabet. I mean the nations of Middle Asia, who used Arabic before, and Moldavia which used Latin. So this case is not unique in history. None of these switching led to widespread illiteracy. Probably the opposite is true. At least in the Middle Asia, the literacy rate sharply increased during the Soviet rule. It increased in Turkey as well. Why did they use German assistance? Because of the close cultural and other connection with Germany which existed before the war. (This was actually one of the reasons why they entered the war on the German side). German defeat seems irrelevant for this particular project, and the project itself could be prepared before or during the war. EDIT. As an evidence of what I wrote, here is the statistics of literacy rates in Turkey: $URL$ (For Soviet Middle Asia I did not find the data but the increase in literacy rates was dramatic). And to answer some comments: I never wrote that Latin alphabet is simpler than Cyrillic. My point was only that this kind of reform can be relatively painless in what concerns literacy rates. 

According to many Hellenistic accounts, photo-realistic painting was well developed and popular at that time. The legend says that an artist made a picture of a boy with some fruits, and it was so realistic that the birds tried to peck the fruits. The artist however considered this a failure, because the birds who did recognize the fruits as real, were not scared by the boy whom they evidently did not recognize as real. There are many such and similar accounts in the Hellenistic authors who wrote on painting. Unfortunately almost no painting of that period survived. Later famous artists also made photo-realistic drawings, here is an example: $URL$ However, most of them you encounter not in the art museums but in scientific libraries: before the invention of the photography, scientists made many drawings of animals, plants, landscapes etc. These drawings were included in the books as illustrations, but high quality book illustrations are prohibitively expensive, and the originals are difficult to see (most of them are made on paper, and libraries hide them to preserve). Here is an example: $URL$ $URL$ Returning to the artists, few artists in various epochs AIMED at photographic drawing, but some did. Examples are the Dutch 17th century nature mort, $URL$ Polish painter Semiradsky, $URL$ (who drew mythology scenes) or the Russian Vereshchagin who painted the real scenes (a kind of journalist-painter): see Google images Vereshchagin, $URL$
