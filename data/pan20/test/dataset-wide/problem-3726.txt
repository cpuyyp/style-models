I'm reading Switzer's "Algebraic Topology", which talks about the (homology) ASS in chapter 19. His ASS (where he puts $S^0$ in the first slot) either converges to $\pi_n(Y)$, or to $\pi_n(Y)/\cap_{s\geq 0}F^{s,n+s}$ (which happens e.g. when our theory $E$ is the spectrum $H\mathbb{F}_p$ representing $H^*(-;\mathbb{F}_p)$). Switzer doesn't talk about this at all, but I've seen/heard before that one can also present the ASS as converging to something denoted $[L_EX, L_EY]$. I don't know much about the functor $L_E:Top\rightarrow Top$, but I believe it is characterized as follows: If $E_*X=0$ then we say that $X$ is $E$-acyclic. Now, a space $Y$ is called $E$-local if whenever $X$ is $E$-acyclic, $[X,Y]=0$. Then, the $E$-localization $L_EY$ of $Y$ is an initial object in the category of $E$-local spaces under $Y$. So here is what I'm wondering. The next result after the ASS is the following Proposition 19.11: If $\iota_*:\pi_q(S^0)\rightarrow \pi_q(E)$ is an isomorphism for $q\leq 0$ and an epimorphism for $q=1$ and if $\pi_q(Y)=0$ for $q\lt N$ for some $N\in \mathbb{Z}$, then $A^{s,t}=D^s=0$ for all $s,t$, and hence the Adams spectral sequence converges to $\pi_*(Y)$. (Here $\iota:S^0\rightarrow E$ is the unit map.) This seems very much like a fact about localization in disguise -- presumably it'd be saying something about $L_EY$, perhaps that $Y=L_EY$. Except that I don't know what $L_ES^0$ is, which I'd imagine should be the first thing anyone would try to figure out. So I guess my questions are: 

By item 1, we can also study these homotopy types instead via their Grothendieck constructions, namely the opfibrations $\mbox{Gr}(F) \to C$ and $\mbox{Gr}(G) \to C$; more precisely, Thomason's homotopy colimit theorem says that we have weak homotopy equivalences $X' = N(\mbox{Gr}(F)) \xrightarrow{\approx} X$ and $Y' = N(\mbox{Gr}(G)) \xrightarrow{\approx} Y$, under which identifications the above section diagram becomes equivalent to one $$ \alpha' : X' \stackrel{\curvearrowleft}{\rightarrow} Y' : \sigma' $$ of (nerves of) opfibrations over $N(C)$. Now, a section diagram induces one upon application of any functor, so in particular $\alpha'$ is surjective on $\pi_n$ for all $n$ (and all basepoints). So it would suffice to show that $\sigma'$ is also surjective on $\pi_n$, and by item 2 we only need to check $n \geq 1$. Note too that it suffices to check on free homotopy classes of maps. So a precise statement of my question could take the form: 

Rich Schwartz had on his site a great paper consisting of only a picture which proved that every right triangle admits a periodic billiard path. Unfortunately, he's since deleted it, so I can't post it here. (It shouldn't take too long for anyone interested to re-construct the proof, though.) 

In Lurie's "A Survey of Elliptic Cohomology", he writes on page 14 that if $A$ is an ordinary commutative ring considered as an $E_\infty$-ring, then $A$-module spectra are the same thing as objects of the derived category of $A$-modules. This is mysterious to me. On the one hand, to an $A$-module spectrum $M$ we might associate the $A$-modules $\pi_n(M)$, but I don't know of any interesting maps between these; perhaps this will just end up being the homology of any representative chain complex of $A$-modules. But then, I certainly don't see a natural way of getting from an object of $\mathcal{D}(\mbox{Mod}_A)$ to an $A$-module spectrum. Incidentally, what does this induce on the level of categories? The obvious first guess is that $A$-module spectra actually form a topological category and that passing to $\mathcal{D}(\mbox{Mod}_A)$ applies $\pi_0$. 

Here is a solution, based on Jeffrey's comment: Let $f:L\rightarrow K(\pi,n)$ be the map classifying $\iota$. We will show that the induced map $f_*:H_i(L)\rightarrow H_i(K(\pi,n))$ is isomorphic for $i \lt n+1$ and epimorphic for $i=n+1$. This will imply by Whitehead's theorem that the same is true for $f_\# :\pi_i(L)\rightarrow \pi_i(K(\pi,n))$ (assuming $n \gt 1$). First, $f_*$ is automatically an isomorphism for $i \lt n$, since in that case by the Hurewicz theorem $H_i(L)$ and $H_i(K(\pi,n))$ are both trivial. Next, in dimension $n$, we use the fact that $f^*:H^n(K(\pi,n);\pi)\rightarrow H^n(L;\pi)$ satisfies $f^*\iota_n = \iota$, where $\iota_n$ is the fundamental class of $K(\pi,n)$. By the universal coefficient and Hurewicz theorems, we may regard $H^n(K(\pi,n))=Hom(H_n(K(\pi,n)),\pi)$ and $H^n(L)=Hom(H_n(L),\pi)$, and the fundamental classes both correspond to isomorphisms (namely, the inverses of the respective Hurewicz homomorphisms). In general, if a group homomorphism $\varphi:B\rightarrow A$ induces $\varphi^\#:Hom(A,C)\rightarrow Hom(B,C)$ and $\varphi^\#$ takes an isomorphism $\psi_1:A\rightarrow C$ to an isomorphism $\psi_2:B \rightarrow C$, then $\varphi$ itself must be an isomorphism, because $\psi_2 = \varphi^\# (\psi_1)=\psi_1\varphi$ and so $\varphi = \psi_1^{-1}\psi_2$. Here, since $f^*:Hom(H_n(K(\pi,n)),\pi)\rightarrow Hom(H_n(L),\pi)$ is induced from $f_*:H_n(L)\rightarrow H_n(K(\pi,n))$ and takes an isomorphism to an isomorphism, then $f_*:H_n(L)\rightarrow H_n(K(\pi,n))$ itself is an isomorphism. Lastly, by the Hurewicz theorem, since $K(\pi,n)$ is $n$-connected, the Hurewicz homomorphism $h:\pi_{n+1}(K(\pi,n))\rightarrow H_{n+1}(K(\pi,n))$ is an epimorphism, but $\pi_{n+1}(K(\pi,n))=0$ by definition so $H_{n+1}(K(\pi,n))=0$ as well. Hence $f_*: H_{n+1}(L)\rightarrow H_{n+1}(K(\pi,n))$ is automatically epimorphic. 

An easy case is the flat torus (that is, a torus with the flat metric -- the one induced from its representation as a square in the plane with edges identified). There, the ant will return home if and only if the slope of its walk is rational. I think this means that with probability 1, the ant will not return home! 

There's a workshop at MSRI in a couple months on the Kervaire invariant problem that I'd really like to attend. I saw Hopkins speak about it a while back without understanding much of the talk, but I'm thinking that maybe by now I'm more prepared to see what it's all about. At least, I'd like to be able to get something out of the workshop, even if I don't understand everything that's going on. I don't know much more about the problem than the wikipedia article can tell me. So, I'm looking for: (a) recommendations for reading to acquaint myself with the necessary background information, and (b) a sketch of the story -- I can somewhat follow the intro to the paper itself, but seeing some of the details spelled out would help me start to actually understand what's going on. (Or, unfortunately possibly: (c) a warning that it's probably too difficult to pick up all the material in just a few months and that it's not worth my time to try.) By the way, wikipedia says that Kervaire used the invariant to create a 10-dimensional PL manifold with no differentiable structure, but I thought that the invariant is zero in dimension 10. What's the deal there? 

Any smooth $k$-manifold $M$ comes with a well-defined map $f:M\rightarrow BGL_{k}(\mathbb{R})$ (up to homotopy) classifying its tangent bundle. Since $GL_{k}(\mathbb{R})$ deformation-retracts onto $O_k$, then $BGL_{k}(\mathbb{R})\simeq BO_k$, which is a cute way (though it's certainly overkill) of proving that every smooth manifold admits a Riemannian metric. An almost-complex structure, on the other hand, is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group from $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$ to $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, which is the same as asking for a lift of the classifying map through $BU_n\simeq BGL_n(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow BGL_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$.
