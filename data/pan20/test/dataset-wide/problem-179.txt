Another answer Short of detecting that it is in orbit have the phone unlock itself if its GPS detects that it is at (a) particular location(s) agreed with the government. That location is militarily secure. Maybe inside the location where they assemble nuclear warheads? Should be about as secure as possible. Or at 3000 ft. above such a location and moving at 10mph, which requires being in a helicopter in some very well defended airspace. Only question is how easily can GPS satellite transmissions be spoofed? 

One relevant concept is that of a phase space. The basic idea is that if one entity can exist in two states, then two of them can define four states, three can define eight, and N can have 2 to the power N states. By the time N is large, the number of possible ensemble states or combinations gets so large that there is not enough time in a universe for any state to repeat, or for more than an infinitesimal fraction of possible states ever to exist. For example in biology: no creature that has ever existed as a consequence of sexual reproduction will ever exist again as a consequence of a future sexual act. Indeed, only an infinitesimal fraction of the possible individual instances of a species will ever actually be realized. So uniqueness follows from simply from the number of possible combinations of entities compared to the number of entities being permuted and the finite size of the universe within which they are being combined. In practical terms the more important question is about when two similar permutations might seem to be identical, although we know that at a fundamental level they cannot be so. 

Here is one incredibly powerful example of the interaction between society and technology in play in today's world all around you. In one word: privacy. Can we preserve privacy in a digital future, or is it obsolete? Can we live in a world where we can all know everything about everyone? Or in one where the state knows everything about citizens ( or subjects) but they cannot find out anything that the state deems secret? Or in a world where nothing can be read or listened to without explicit permission, which can be revoked at any later time for any reason? All these gave become possible as a result of today's technology. There are many visions of where this will lead, from the utopian through various dystopias to the blackest of tyrannies or the collapse of society back to the stone age. Take your pick or even better, imagine another one. This is not just fiction. It's shaping the world you may be living in within a decade. And there are quite a few other hot topics in play! 

A deeply cynical answer. Paul is the spearhead of the Alien's attack. What they have implanted in his head is all sorts of things calculated to cause us to do damage to ourselves. After all, look at where endogenous paranoia and belief systems and technological advances so nearly landed us during the cold war. One way or another, if Paul fails to think hard and deep about who delivered that bolt of revelation to him, and with what intent, he will (with the best of intentions) cause our civilisation to destroy itself. And he won't. Self-doubt has been erased from his brain at the same time as the rest of the stuff was planted. Actually the aliens are not interested in attack. Rather they are scared that we might discover the secrets of superluminal travel and get out there and attack them. They need to knock our sudden technological advances of the last 100 years off the rails to give their human-domestication project time to succeed. If they merely wanted to destroy us they would just spark WW3. That's their plan B, but they have morals and are trying something less genocidal as plan A. We are still a few decades away from the big secrets. 

It's a world right on the inner edge of its star's goldilocks zone. It'll be like Venus in a few million years. But for now it has cloud cover of 95% and it's raining almost everywhere most of the time. Some places all of the time. Probably too hot and humid for humans ( especially away from the poles) but for your aliens it's home sweet home. 

I'm assuming an alternative Earth in the following. Same physics, climates, DNA based life, fish as common ancestor to all higher land based life. No centaurs or superintelligent insect colonies. Maximum size is quite easy. Something like a gorilla. Much larger and falling over becomes a hazard to life. But an elephant doesn't have hands and can't evolve into a centauroid because it's body plan was set by its fish ancestor. I don't think a trunk is a sufficient substitute for hands for developing technology. Now the interesting direction. Smaller. The basic physics is that surface area goes as length squared but volume as length cubed. A creature 10% the weight of H.Sap. couldn't support a human sized brain. Is that necessary? I think not. There have been people with anomalously small brains which were discovered at post mortem of a "normal" person. And there's Alex the parrot who approached chimp intelligence on a walnut sized brain. So I'd deduce that a brain one tenth human weight might evolve to support human equivalent intelligence. One hundredth, I'd doubt. Not least because a third or more of our brain is dedicated to vision processing. A half-scale human has one eighth of the brain volume. Such a biped would average around a meter tall. I've fudged upwards a bit because it would not need to be proportionally as thick set as a human. Smaller limbs can be more slender and a smaller body falls less hard. Now given the necessary intellect and hands could it access technology? Consider some key developments. Coming down out of the trees ( only environment that encourages evolution of hands?) Proto-humans could stand to see above the prairie. Is three feet high sufficient? There's no obvious route to using fire if you keep living in trees. OTOH meerkats exist. Fire. Making fire by friction is not easy. The creature has to dump sufficient muscular energy into a dry stick in a short time window. Like most kids I have tried and failed. Could any creature with one tenth human average arm muscle mass succeed? Perhaps, especially if it had theropod dinosaur ancestry rather than mammalian. Birds are from that branch of the tree of life and can support a higher metabolic rate. Otherwise are natural fire sources sufficient to attain technology? Weapons. A tribe of humans with spears can defeat any predator often enough that the predator learns to leave humans alone or becomes extinct. Could a one-tenth human-mass creature become the top predator? Also could they develop bows and arrows? A scaled down arrow rapidly becomes non lethal. Agriculture. Could these creatures domesticate oxen and horses? If not then ploughing becomes problematic as does keeping large wild herbivores away from the crops. Also the wheel works better for ox-carts than llama-carts or human-carts. The Incas didn't get to the wheel. I hope this is food for thought. Technology would clearly be harder to attain for a creature with human intellect but one tenth our body mass. It feels like a lower limit even if you bless it with dinosaur genes. 

Unless things change a lot, whoever owns the ship, gets to choose the name. If you get that person's character developed you'll probably be able to decide what sort of names he'd give his main assets. At present the owners are mostly governments, which accounts for the uninspired "Voyager" "Intrepid" "Enterprise" etc. On the other hand, Elon Musk (SpaceX) is paying hommage to the late Iain M Banks and naming his spaceship recovery drones after Culture ships: "Just Read the Instructions" and "Of Course I Still Love You". More, please! And for every Behemoth of a mother ship there will be a thousand small service vehicles. I expect these will be too insignificant to be named by the corporation (other than as Asset #192458-2781 "external access vehicle") which will acquire names from those who operate them or work inside them. Visit any port for ideas. My suggestion: assume any popular theme will be pushed to its limits, and then some. If there are spaceships called "Lion" and "Cheetah" then sooner or later there will be a "Warthog", a "Duck-Billed Platypus", and (eventually) a "Lesser Horned Toad". 

Bacteria. Even random naturally occurring ones are a problem that petroleum engineers know well. They turn oil flowing freely through pores in rock into gels and goos that reduce or prevent flow. Just think what a genetically engineered bacterium might do. The most effective way to make sure both oil and coal stay underground would be to invent a better battery. Solar electricity is already cost competitive while the sun shines. Reduce the cost of storing it by an order of magnitude, and the oil age will be over within a few decades. "The stone age did not end because we ran out of stones". Who will burn oil or coal when electricity is universally cheaper? 

Ideas: They have a secret second language or mode which is never used with outsiders present. This may be linked to maintaining a stable relationship to a second intelligent species. There are human societies where it is almost taboo to express particular modes of thought outside of particular social contexts. They have a language with a large vocabulary augmented by a large range of subtle modifiers and an unusually rapid acceptance of neologisms. The combination means that there is always a right word existing or coined when the need is manifest, so idioms do not exist. The subtle modifiers may be extremely difficult for an outsider to master or they may be a secret. Some might be nonverbal. Without them mutual comprehension is still possible but the outsiders think that the language is far more literal and crude than it really is. I do not speak Chinese (meaning any of a large family of related languages and dialects). I was told that because of the tonal nature of the language, every single word is a stack of possible puns: the same sound in different tones. Therefore it is almost impossible to talk without indulging in all sorts of subtle wordplay that will be missed if it is not your mother tongue. Anyone Chinese care to comment? 

There are very many natural and artificial materials which today are available only in tiny quantities. In the future, in bulk? Examples include spider silk (and spinarets to fabricate with it) and buckminsterfullerenes with precisely controlled chemical substitutions so they can be built into molecules and polymers. Oh and unwettable dirt-shedding fabrics nanostructured like lotus leaves. One thing we have no leads on. Theory suggests room temperature superconductors are possible. If one were discovered it would have huge impact. Superconductivity remains very poorly understood compared to most other properties of matter. It's not really a supermaterial but if someone could work out how to produce muons in an energy-efficient manner we'd have our energy needs satisfied via muon-catalysed fusion: a trivially simple process if you have the muons. More possibly a really high energy density battery or capacitor that lasts well and is not prone to exploding when provoked. I'm optimistic i'll see electrical energy storage cracked in my lifetime and a fully solar powered future arriving.
