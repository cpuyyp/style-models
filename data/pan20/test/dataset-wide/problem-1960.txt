Don't overthink this. Just tell your colleague what you have told us here, that is clear and polite. You are making it clear that you cannot do the code review because you are overwhelmed with other important tasks. More importantly, a code review done "just to get it over with" would not only be unprofessional, but also cause potential harm to the project, especially if they hold your reviews in high regard. You should also try to offer them an alternative so that their work doesn't get stalled just because you don't have the time. That way, you also avoid making it sound like "this is not my problem". Suggest them to contact someone else who you think could do the code review instead, or if there is no one like that, suggest (or even offer) to ask management to find someone. It is quite common for IT folks to get overwhelmed with tasks every once in a while. I don't see any reason why your colleague would need to be offended by your refusal, as long as you are not a jerk about it (which you clearly are not). In summary, something like the below should do: 

Unless it is against the local law to ask such questions, the interviewer can ask whatever he wants. There is no "right" or "wrong" about it. It is upto the candidate whether he wants to answer the question or not, and how he chooses to evaluate the company based on the interview questions asked. If the candidate doesn't want to answer the question, all he needs to do is decline politely. 

You might want to assure your co-worker that an immediate response is not expected to emails. Email facilitates "asynchronous" communication, letting people read and respond to them at their convenience. This is in contrast to face-to-face or telephonic communication, which requires presence of all parties at the same time. This is especially useful for communication across timezones. It cannot be rude to use email for a purpose it serves so well. If he still cannot contain his urge to respond immediately, preventing any "rudeness" is well within your co-worker's control. He could easily stop checking emails in the middle of the night, for example. This is a lot easier than demanding everyone else to remember not to send him emails at certain times. As for IMs, I would suggest pinging him only when his status shows "Available" (or equivalent). IM should be preferably used when instant responses are expected, so your co-worker's concern is more understandable here. However, your co-worker checking IMs at midnight is still a problem, and he seriously needs to stop doing that. 

There is nothing wrong at all if the manager chose the first option. However, considering that the colleague was trying to be helpful, he probably decided to assume good intentions and give them a chance to save face. 

Don't make a public spectacle of it, don't start by complaining that it is bothering you. Just ask. If he insists to know why, you could tell him the music is so good that you are paying more attention to the music than to your work. :-) The problem with passive aggressive ideas like earplugs and headphones is this: 

Fixing it now is clearly going to be far less serious. You might even earn some brownie points from the recruiter for honestly owning up your mistake. 

However, I would recommend omitting the degree, and maybe even the school, from your profile, because if you have a Bachelor's – or higher – degree, then the Higher Secondary Certificate (informally also called 10+2) does not add much value to your profile. The technically correct answer to your question, though, is High School, which is roughly the US equivalent of the Indian 10+2. LinkedIn, being a US-based site, provides the degree options from a US context. The term High School has a different meaning in India, and it roughly corresponds to "Junior High School" in the US. Your profile will be seen more often by Indians than Americans, at least in the early years of your career. They would be left somewhat bemused by your "High School" degree, which does not help you much. 

Avoid bypassing management's priorities: When requirements come through the official communication channels, it is easier for management to prioritize the tasks. Every customer wants their issue to be given the highest priority, but nothing will get done when everything is urgent. Management assigns priority to prevent such chaos. By contacting the lower level employees directly, you bypass the management, which can create problems. Avoid perception of preferential treatment: Allowing personal contacts for communication means companies that do not have such personal contacts in the company will have to wait longer or get inferior service. Even if that is not true, the company's other customers will carry that perception if they find out about this personal contact arrangement. Official contacts are well trained for the job: Why do companies send spokespersons to press conferences instead of any random employee? How do these spokespersons respond "no comment" without batting an eyelid to controversial questions? Representing your company to outsiders is serious business, for which the company trains them thoroughly. When things go well, using personal contacts instead of the official channels doesn't do any harm, but when things are not so rosy, such personal contacts can create problems for the company. What happens when the personal contact doesn't give you the required information, or gives the wrong information? What if you say something rude which damages your company's relationship with the other company? Prevent accidental divulgence of confidential information: Personal contacts in companies have varying levels of awareness of corporate policies. A somewhat naive employee could unintentionally divulge company confidential information to outsiders. 

There seems to be either a communication problem or an overreaction here. To begin with, email chains are not at all an effective means of communication, even within the course of a day. When the mail chain grows longer than about 4 mails, it is hard to keep track of who said what to whom, and what was the conclusion reached. Asking for the status of a task that she thought you were working on is not "calling you out as incompetent". You do not specify exactly what she wrote in her mail, but I suspect you are upset because she chose a tone similar to "I asked you to do task X, why haven't you done it yet?" Instead, she could ask for the status in a more neutral tone: 

There! Done. Do this a couple of times and he will break his habit. Always give the other person the chance to save face. There is no need to make a song and dance about another person's mistakes. So don't get up and shut the door yourself right after he leaves. Your action will be easily noticed by everyone in a small office and people can put two and two together, even if you don't say anything. There is no need to embarass your boss before everyone, nothing good ever comes out of such passive aggressive actions. There is also no need to setup a chat specifically to tell him about the smell. He should already know that human excrement has a disagreeable smell, no need to make him feel silly by reminding him. 

Employments are terminated all the time for a variety of reasons, most common among them being resignation, end of contract, and getting fired. There seems to be no good reason why other team members have to know any more details than "Mr X would be leaving the company on DD/MM/YY". People can usually guess if an employee was fired based on the preceding events, but as a manager, you don't have to disclose confidential details to anyone who doesn't need to know. There is also no need to set an example for the other team members as to what can get you fired. They should know what is expected of them without "referring to an example". Besides, announcing to the remaining team members that "this guy for fired because he did that, and it could happen to you as well" only hurts morale, as people will begin to wonder "who's next on the boss's list?" 

I never feel comfortable calling myself an "expert" in any skill on the resume, because obviously I don't know everything on any topic. I know nobody knows everything, but I still have this fear that if I am not able to answer a handful of questions on the skill in which I am an "expert", it would create a bad impression. Is there a guideline on when a person can be called an expert in a skill? 

You don't. What people do after working hours is entirely their business. Work is not the only important thing in life. You cannot demand or even expect that everyone else should be reading technical books after working hours, neither can you pass judgements like these on people who don't. 

This is not true. The relieving letter can be, and usually is, submitted after coming on board. It is usually impractical to submit the relieving letter on or before the joining day because: 

Your boss is right. From the company's perspective, the intern was hired to do the company's work, and he should not be doing anything else on company time. While internship is certainly different from a normal employment, in that the intern's academic course credits depend on it, it is not your problem. The intern is responsible for completing his dissertation and anything else required to complete his course. He has to figure out how to manage his time. As other users have pointed out, it was bizarre on your part to offer him company time to do his academic work. That may have led him to believe that he is entitled to company time to complete his dissertation, and hence the complaint that you did not give him enough. Avoid doing that from now on. 

Don't take criticism personally or get emotional. Focus on solving the problem instead of confrontation. 

As an IT support person, you are only authorized to do what is needed to resolve the users' IT issues. In this case, the user wants his disk replaced without losing his data. Hence, you only need to move the data from the old disk to the new disk, and replace the disk. Snooping into the contents of the disk because you found them "interesting" is a breach of trust, whether or not it is a violation of company policy or local laws. 

This should do. If they tell you that Saturday is a holiday, then you could ask if you are expected to come to work on October 1st. If it was a mistake, they would tell you the correct joining date. If Saturday is a working day, you won't create an awkward situation if you ask a question as above, as against something like, "My joining date is October 1st, but I thought Saturday is a holiday." There is also the possibility the company prefers doing the joining formalities on a non-working day, in which case, I expect they would explain that to you. 

Easy! Beat him at his own game. Assign to him the task of implementing his own excellent ideas. Mention that in the status report as well. Talking about great ideas is easy, but when he is forced to deal with the implementation challenges, one of these things will happen: 

1 India is culturally very similar to Sri Lanka. The OP also mentioned in the comments that he was ok with referencing Indian culture. 2 In this answer, I assume the colleague is male. This is only for ease of reading, but applies equally to a female colleague too. 

Leave it at that. Don't try to "justify" why you are reminding him, or "apologize" for reminding him too often. Repeat as often as needed without feeling irritated or guilty. Don't overthink this. The boss is clearly more concerned about the work getting done, as a good boss should be, and shouldn't mind being reminded once too often, especially since he has clearly told you so. By the way, it would be rather odd to use WhatsApp or email to send simple messages to a person sitting next to you, especially if he is your boss, but if that floats your boss' boat, doing that would also be fine. 

Ask your manager what to do. Don't assume that taking the day off is not an option. If you don't ask, you will never know. I am sure your manager will be able to figure out some alternatives. If you are concerned about losing a holiday day, you could suggest taking a "reverse comp-off", whereby you take the day off today and come in to work on a future holiday. If I were your manager, I would rather focus on what can help you cope with the situation than worry about the holiday policy. I certainly wouldn't want you to be worried about work while shaking and trying to hold tears. If I found out about it later, I would be absolutely horrified. 

Relax! Nobody will take you to court over a small mistake made at the start of your career. No company, and certainly not a startup, would waste so much money in legal fees, for a 3-day overlap in job, especially in case of a relatively junior employee. Besides, the court is very likely to throw out such a frivolous case, and reprimand the company for wasting its time. Your company found an anomaly in your employment history and asked you for an explanation. This is not a molehill that you should make a mountain of. You made a honest mistake, so just tell them that. Don't try to get "creative" and cover it up with strange excuses. They could, however, take disciplinary action against you if they found any misinformation in your job application. However, that is highly unlikely unless there is clear evidence of fraud. In my experience, HR will most likely just make note of your explanation in their records, and close the matter since your explanation is easily believable. Bad news for you, though, you may have to keep explaining this for a while at future jobs or interviews.1 Just tell them that it was a misunderstanding on your part, that is, you had assumed that the date agreed with the team lead was the last working day, and you did not realize the significance of the official company records back then. Unless the company has strangely rigid policies in this matter, they will not make a huge deal out of it.
