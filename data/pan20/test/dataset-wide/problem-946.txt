Simpler models, e.g the dipol model also suggest how the magnetic declination varies with distance from the Earth's magnetic center. The approximation work rather well at low latitudes and at the Earth's surface. It can also be used to model Earth's magnetic field in an astronomical context. Apart from declination, there is also an inclination to take into account. Near the magnetic poles, the compass needle will not be horizontal, but get a dip. This can make normal field compasses almost useless near the magnetic poles (trust me, I tried..). 

Lava is per definition the molten material on the surface or a hardened rock thereof. Lava is expelled from a volcano or fissure. There is a rich vocabulary to describe the composition, formation and processes of lava. Magma is a melt within the earth. Magma is formed when material reach a temperature for melting or partial melting, e.g. in a magma chamber. Complex high temperature chemistry is used to describe how solid material melts to magma and how it recrystallizes into igneous rocks as a response to temperature, pressure and changed composition. Magma can originate from any kind of material. The definitions doesn't refer to the composition or origin of the material, but the manifestation. Magma can be melted or partially melted crust, also old volcanic crust, so if old lava somehow re-enters a magma chamber it will be magma. When magma is erupted, it is lava. There is often some confusion, even among professional geologists, about many of the terms we are using. Some terms describes a process and other describes an object. Sometimes we say Upper Jurassic, sometimes Late Jurassic depending on the context. Some terms are historical and some are modern... There are often overlaps. As for any language, it's good to use a broad vocabulary and adopt to the jargon, but most important is to communicate the ideas and observations as clear as possible. 

Yes.Thermohaline circulation is dependent on differences in water density, caused by differences in temperature and salinity between different bodies of water. It therefore requires deepwater areas, of which the northern and middle Atlantic have the most, for these differences or "gradients" to form. These are influences on the Gulf Stream. In addition, the Gulf Stream is wind driven, as is true of most currents. So it depends on both influences. 

Robert Mallet is sometimes referred to as the "father of seismology." He was helped (around 1850) by the newly created science of photography, which enabled him to create seismic "maps" of the earth, at different depths. He has started life as an iron engineer/manufacturer, but turned his talents to seismology after a number of devastating earthquakes in Europe. His earlier work with iron gave him a background in the use of explosives to "open up" the earth at critical points. Paleoseismology is a related field that relies on paleontology to form estimates of various properties of the earth. 

CC BY-SA 3.0 The main wind pattern is also western, but with prevailing eastern winds, they might end up in Scotland, depending on the vessel. The Jutlandic coast has experienced a large number of shipwrecks in the past. 

Rifting is an ongoing process. At the moment, e.g. East Africa is rifting apart from the Nubian plate, we also see rifting of continental plates elsewhere, eg Rio Grande. New continents are being formed, but it doesn't happen on a human time scale. Modellers of future geography have a difficult task to decide what rifts that will stop and what rift that eventually will result in a new continent. See yellow marked faults and rifts: 

The currents run counterclockwise. That's why the Humboldt Current cools the Pacific coast of South America, because the water is coming from the "six o'clock" position in the Antarctica. But in the Northern Hemisphere, the "six o'clock" position is warm water near the equator, which warms Oregon and Washington. In the northern hemisphere, the cold Labrador current cools land to its west. That's because the water is coming from the "12 o'clock position near the Arctic. On the other hand, the west coast benefits from warm water currents running in a counterclockwise direction. That's because the "6 'oclock" position in the northern hemisphere is near the tropics, which brings warm water to Washington and Oregon at the "2-3 o'clock" position. All other things being equal, colder air carries less moisture than warm air, and land near cold water currents is dryer than land near warm water currents. 

I'd suggest to get out and do some mapping. Get a map, look for local outcrops and mark them on your map. Try to find the same type of rocks or unit in more than one location and try to connect them. Compare it with published maps and see if it makes sense. Then start to think about the reasons why the units are located as they are and read a bit about tectonics. Your chemical interest is useful to define the rocks you find (e.g. use acid to recognize carbonates) and your biological interest is useful if you are fortunate enough to live in an area where you can find fossil bearing rocks to help you with the dating. The experiences you make whiles learning the trade can suggest what the local work market looks like. Learn GIS and mapping. Geology is a great way to combine theoretical studies with fieldwork and use some excess energy. Let your interests define what branch of geology you would like to focus on. 

To build on Drew's excellent answer, I would note the following: Weather forecasts of the future are built on historical frequencies. A "forecast" of a X percent chance of rain (however defined), means, based on the current configuration of casual variables (temperature, humidity, air pressure etc.), there has historically been an X per cent chance of rain in 24 hours. Therefore, we forecast X percent for tomorrow. Sometimes a forecaster will try to incorporate unusual events into the equation. (Chernobyl comes to mind.) Then the argument might be, historically the chances of rain were X percent, but we're bumping up the forecast to y percent, because of all the atomic particles released by Chernobyl. 

The landscape is also known as Pepino Hills sometimes mogotes, if they are surrounded by flat landscape. Another interesting feature is that as karst caves collapse, the cavity fills up with material from the ceiling and the cavity can continue to migrate upwards through the stratigraphy. Those karsts can be important channels for groundwater or petroleum. Sometimes the collapse material is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding rocks, and we get pinnacles of karst breccia left behind. 

Ice floats with gravity towards lower elevation, the flow continues until the base of the ice sheet becomes floating and the ice forms an ice shelf or icebergs. Due to the subglacial topography, basal melting and mass balance, the flow velocities vary over a large range, faster outflows are glaciers. The pattern is somehow similar to how rivers transport rainwater towards the coasts. The thickness of the ice sheet is controlled by a complex relation between accumulation, ablation and compaction. 

It mainly depends on where you are "coming from," rather than where you are "going to." In September, you are "coming from" a hot summer. The earth has been hot recently, and will take some time to cool down (in your part of the world. In March, you are "coming from" a cold winter. The earth has been cold recently, and will take some time to heat up. "Cold and "hot" are where you are "going to," in September and March, respectively, but the weather on the equinox days are dictated by the "rearview mirror." Put another way, the amount of solar energy that reached the earth "today" is less important a factor in the heat than what happened "recently" or just before. 

I don't know the book and the quality of fiction are rarely in the facts. However, it is always nice to think about the spinning of our planet and how our theories and methods relate to the actual astronomic observations. Historically there have been a number of prime meridians, sometimes used simultaneously and sometimes to large confusion. However, what reference you use doesn't change the duration of day and year. The calendars clearly described by Fred and kingledion are there to synchronize the day of year with the astronomic reasons for seasons. Farmers as well as priests plan the year according to the calendar dates and expect equinox at same day every year and the harvest to be in the same month. You can think of the prime meridian as the offset and the calendar as the frequency of our time units. Even when we refer the time zone to Greenwich it is still only a way to express the relation between time zones. With a US prime meridian the sun would still rise about 6am at equinox all over the world unless the evil pope in the book also forced a time zone of choice to people living near other meridians. However there might be situations where it's practical or politically motivated to use the same time across meridians, even if it means that some people will have sunrise well into lunch time at equinox. Technically, by moving the prime meridian some 30Â° to the west while keeping the Gregorian calendar would only delay the correction dates with a few hours, but on the other hand, people living just East of the International Date Line will get their correction a day earlier, and might appreciate the new cardinal coordinates, if they have an extremely strong sense for daylight and time. The Gregorian calendar was an important step to adjust the supernatural believes to actual observations. A year that is 365.2425 days long suggests a more complex universe than any simple cogwheel mechanics. If the evil pope really would like to suppress logic and perception, he or she should change the length of our time units rather than just relocating the coordinate system. 

The Pacific Rim is pretty much defined by the so-called "Ring of Fire." It consists of the "stomping ground" for a disproportionate number of earthquakes and volcanoes, and the affected territory extends up and down the coast of North and South America, up and down the East Asian coast, and into the "Australasian" islands like Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Zealand. Apparently it has something to do with the presence (or absence) of tectonic plates there. Why is there such a configuration of tectonic plates, and the resulting earthquakes and volcanoes in the Pacific, and not to the other oceans? 

The Pacific coast of South America is affected by the Humboldt Current, a wind-driven "upwelling" system running counterclockwise that is cold and windy but nutrient rich.. The "six o'clock" position indeed touches Antarctica, and then the right edge of the "clock" reaches Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, as far north as the Galapagos Islands near the equator, making those areas cooler than equivalent latitudes on the Atlantic coast. The reason the currents don't "originate" in the Antarctica is because they are part of a circular system that spans a whole ocean in the southern hemisphere. But they "make stops" there. The ocean and atmosphere mutually interact to create a "coupled" system that brings about the so-called ENSO El Nino (La Nina) Southern Oscillation, with its characteristic weather changes. 

A person would not detect much else than the surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves). The later body waves phases are of very low amplitude and are only detected by a sensitive seismometer. Also, at a short offset, it is often hard to pick later phases, even if they occur. There is a critical angle for seismic refraction, but not for reflection. 0-offset reflection originates just beneath the source. The core-mantle boundary represent a large change in elastic properties, so some energy will bounce back to the surface. We call these phases PcP, ScP and ScS phases (Pressure-core-Pressure etc). The PcP is the reflected P-wave and ScS is the reflected S-wave. The ScP wave is an interesting phenomena, as it's formed as a part of the energy in the S-wave is converted into a P wave and reflected. There are also higher orders of seismic wave phases that can be detected (or modelled in synthetic seismograms) near the epicenter, the PcP2 and ScS2 e.g. (not shown in figure). The PKiKP is a reflection from the inner core.
