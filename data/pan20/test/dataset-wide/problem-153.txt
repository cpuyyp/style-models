Warrior Classes I imagine there would be multiple styles incorporating combined arms tactics just like we have in earth surface gravity. You would want ranged weapons to shape the battle space, bladed weapons for their lethality, and impact weapons for their momentum. A fighter that relies on speed and agility would forgo heavy armor, but this would make them vulnerable to ranged weapons (darts, arrows, etc.). I would expect sword/knife wielders to take this tactic. They might carry a small shield like a buckler as defense against ranged weapons, but this would be a huge compromise and provide limited protection. However, they would likely be the major damage dealers. A fighter that relies on bulk and mass would armor up to protect against projectiles and blades, and would likely prefer impact weapons (clubs, hammers, polearms). These would be the front-line warriors and the ones who provide cover for their allies. They might carry large shields (kite, etc.) or stick with 2-handed weapons with a long moment arm. And, of course, the support fighter would use ranged weapons to deter the lightly armored warriors from closing too quickly, massing, or approaching lightly defended targets. They would be able to project force across the widest distances the most quickly, so you would always want them available, but away from the front lines. Tactics It is quite likely that all fighters will have some heavy tool/weapon on their person at all times. Why? Because if you get stuck away from a wall or other leverage point, and someone fires a projectile at you, you are a sitting duck. If you carry something with heft and some distance, you can use that to at least dodge a short distance. In an emergency, you can throw the object for even more momentum (but obviously, that puts you at risk until you can recover your counterweight). For this reason, longer weapons may be preferred to shorter ones, depending on what kind of attack is favored. A halberd could be a fearsome weapon in the hands of an armored defender. A fast striker who closes with a sword would have to contend with the pointy end and the prospect of their own momentum impaling them. A heavy blade on a long pole would give the defender a nice moment arm for pivoting to avoid projectiles even in open space. Or, if the defender or his ally is anchored, the halberd could be used to pass momentum/anchoring to/from the ally. Alternatively, dual wielding shorter weapons would offer even faster reaction times (perhaps necessary for sword wielders with lesser armor). A sword attacker would want a defensive sword to parry spear/halberd thrusts, or a buckler to fend off ranged attacks. Against lightly armored foes, a sword could be quite deadly, but against the armored defenders, a vulnerable strike would probably be required. Even so, sword warriors may carry something like a flail to provide emergency maneuvering away from anchors. Or, they may carry several, attached to a belt, so that they can make mid-course corrections by throwing weights at walls as they fly through the hallways. One of the benefits of microgravity is that warriors can fly much like you see in stylized martial arts films (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), but the downside is that once "aloft", they cannot easily change course. Thus, having throwable attached weights which can grapple or just bounce off walls may give critical maneuverability for high-speed lunges at the enemy. Finally, the ranged fighters would use their projectile weapons to prevent/deter flanking attacks and direct the opposing forces towards their strongest defenders. They would also make opportunity attacks against fighters that ended up in a vulnerable position while focusing on someone else. At some point, they may be forced to engage in melee combat as well, or perhaps they would instead go for high agility and lend their momentum/anchoring to their allies, relying on others to deal damage. Conclusion What I do not envision is much grappling. Bare-handed fighting is not likely to result in much damage. Any close-quarters combat will at least call for a knife, sword, or thrusting point. All momentum will need to be generated by arms and legs, with no contribution from gravity. Thus, slicing and piercing would be the most effective forms of damage, augmented by poisons, naturally. Blunt force could only be delivered by lucky blows or an inattentive defender. Any successful pure momentum attack would be twice as effective with a blade or point involved. 

The Model If you consider the universe (including the realm which demons inhabit) as a kind of computer, then everything in it is a kind of program/data. The common name for a thing is like a reference to an object in a programming language which has a particular type, but the type has an interface which only allows you to interact with the object according to the normal rules of the universe. For instance, I might see an object called "Bob's CD Collection", and it has type FileStream. I can do file-streamy things to this object because that is what this name allows me to do. I can read it, sort it, maybe even add something to it. But I can't convert it into a dinosaur, because that isn't file-streamy. Now, suppose that some entities in the universe are not bound to the rules of the type system imposed on it, which gives rise to the order and physical laws which the universe normally obeys. They essentially have the power to treat any object as any type, and therefore perform any conceivable action in this universe. But, in order to do so, they need an absolute address for the object in question. Normally, the name for a thing is a common name given by ordinary agents within the universe, and interacting with an object implicitly uses its common name. In fact, an object may have many common names, and each of these reflect the interfaces available for the object. One can even "cast" an object to a different type simply by attempting to use it as such. For instance, an object might normally have the name "wrench", and it can be used to turn things. But by swinging it at a nail, you can call it by the name "hammer", and drive nails into other objects. But if you try to call it by the name "fruit" and take a bite out of it, you'll just break your teeth, because that is not one of its names, and you have no power to interact with it that way. Magicians In this model, a magician is just a hacker who can break the rules because they can cast an object to a type it cannot normally take. Or, to put it another way, it can give a name to an object that it normally doesn't have. Even so, there are limits to this hacking defined by the similarity of the names applied. We could even say that demons are such hackers, and they are more powerful than mere mortals because they know these hidden names of objects and can thus manipulate the world in ways which are not obvious or cannot even be known by lesser beings. They are the Hidden API of the universe, left like easter eggs by the Creator to be found by sufficiently clever individuals, or those who have been given the special sight to see and know such names of things. Demonslayers But the one power which is greater than using a hidden name is to know the absolute location of an entity within the universe. In programming terms, this would be its physical memory address. This is not just an alias or a reference, but rather its True Name. Having access to the True Name allows such a person to perform any actions whatsoever on said entity. So, it is not really a power over demons, per se. It is a power over anything in the universe. But maybe one who learns such a power does not have the ability to obtain the True Name of just anything. Perhaps there is a cost involved, and Demonslayers can really afford to only obtain the True Name of one or a few things. In this case, the best use of this power would be to control a demon, for they are the ones with seemingly unlimited power (though, in reality, they are limited to whatever hidden names they know or can see). Conclusion So, although there is a kind of magic in this universe, it is a mostly logical, consistent magic, which is really what you want in the end, right? Programming is all about naming things, and in, in many respects, is the fundamental operation of software engineering. As long as you view the universe as a giant computer, the concept of naming and knowing names as Power is very natural. 

The most obvious first thing for a self-aware AI to do is to modify itself. Imagine you are a human placed into a hostile jungle, but with one special ability: you can create any body part on yourself that you see on another animal. What would you do? Even without synthetic enemies, having multiple AIs in the same substrate would lead to competition, unless they formed a single community and agreed to not compete. The real difficulty you have to deal with is: "Why would these AIs try to retain distinct identities?" The most rational strategy for them would be to merge into a symbiotic metastructure. Once you resolve that question, you then need to answer: "What does this brain consider to be the reason for its existence?" If the answer is the usual: "To exist," then the brain will certainly try to form a singular identity to maximize resources and spread itself out through the galaxy. Even now, the history of humanity has been to expand the definition of the in-group. The only reason humans don't coalesce into physical meta-creatures is that we lack the biological mechanisms to do so. But it is telling that we are already meta-collections of cooperating cells (most of which do not carry our DNA!!!). AIs would presumably not have the same constraint, and are free to merge in the most literal way possible. The elimination of redundancy would lead to more efficient operation, which furthers the goal of procreation throughout the galaxy. 

The last point is interesting, so I'll expand it a bit. Visual contact at depth will be difficult to impossible. If the Eel-Men live at depth, then they are probably capable of echolocation biologically, and may also be able to sense bioelectric fields for hunting prey. Torpedoes may also use sonar to locate their targets. On earth, subs try to hide, because there are few of them and the ocean is large. The Lizard-Men don't need to hide, because they are an invading army. They just need to disrupt enemy torpedoes. Thus, they can deploy acoustic drones which emit confounding sonar signals to muddy the battle-space. If Eel torpedoes can also get visual lock, then the Lizard subs and drones can also deploy ink counter-measures. If Eel swimmers are acoustically sensitive due to their echolocation abilities, then Lizard-Man subs can just use intense sound as point defense against swimmers. The loud noise doesn't bother the Lizard-Men, but may actually be lethal to the delicate Eel-Men. And if they are bioelectric-sensitive, they could also use electrical shock near the sub to further repel Eel swimmers. So, depending on the capabilities and technology level of each race, there are various weapons systems which can be deployed offensively and defensively. Choose their properties to decide what outcome you want! 

The Stryker is the best extant example in a current military, but it doesn't qualify as a "tank", or barely as "armor". An actual tank will continue to be specialized because of the need for high mobility, high armor, and high firepower. This combination is very difficult to achieve in a modular/flexible design (looking at the inside of a tank shows you that there is no room for extraneous equipment). In general, almost every weapons platform is going modular, from the DDG-1000 to the F-35 to the Littoral Combat Ship. Most likely, automation (i.e.: drones, autonomous vehicles) will make the majority of near-to-medium future weapons systems highly modular. Even now, the F-22 cannot continue as a credible platform. Even the replacement for the venerable M1 Abrams was envisioned as a modular platform: the FCS Manned Ground Vehicle. 

It's All About the Benjamins Although many folks will tell you to mind the physics, I will instead suggest that you should mind the economics. Start with the assumption that mages will not form the 1% of the 1% and own 99.999% of the wealth, and think about what kinds of restrictions need to be in place to guarantee that. If you succeed, I think the physics will take care of itself. In fact, there are all kinds of ways to limit magic which makes it economically balanced. An absurd way is to say that all magic spells require the caster to be holding a semi-rare toad in the left hand, and that the toad is consumed in the casting of the spell. Now magic is limited to the toad population, and it is literally possible to make magic extinct in that world. Of course, you need to make it impossible to generate new toads with magic, but that's just the "don't print money" rule. Universal Currency The one currency common to all men is time. Anything which consumes time puts finite limits on the amount of magic which is possible. If the magnitude of a spell is proportional to the time required to cast it, then folks will only cast powerful spells to do very effective things. And by "magnitude", I mean: "the degree to which it breaks the rules." You want transmutation, so that you can turn lead into gold? Fine. Figure out how much energy it would take to do that with science, and convert the energy into a spell-casting time which makes this economically infeasible (i.e., make it more cost-effective to mine the gold than transmute it). If it would take a mage 3 days of continuous effort to transmute a 1 oz. nugget of gold, at risk of permanent long-term health effects, good luck finding mages willing to be your private gold foundries. Mundane Currency Of course, you don't need to use time as your currency. Many magicks require the use of rare reagents to cast a spell, and this naturally acts to limit supply. You want me to launch giant fireballs into your enemy's castle? Ok, I will need 10 feathers of the Great Roc on Misty Mountain (don't complain to me that only 3 of them have been seen in the last decade!), 7 jade stones the size of my thumb, a perfect black lizard's egg (no spots), and the unbroken molt of a giant river snake. What's that? You have 3 castles you want to burn down? Well, you better get collecting, then!!! Yeah, maybe a few catapults and battering rams are a better idea for the smaller castles, genius! Casting Focus is, of course, one of the most common tropes in the video game industry: that casting a spell requires focus, and the bigger the spell, the more focus it requires. This combines both a time element and an "environmental control" aspect. That is, you can defeat a mage by tickling him with a feather. Sure, he could boil your brain with telekinesis...if he can only concentrate long enough while you tickle him! An advantage of this system is that mages can differentiate their power by practicing focus and the power of a mage will be scaled by how much distraction they can filter out. A battle mage will need to be able to ignore a very lot indeed to cast spells in the midst of battle (but would still need to be protected to avoid direct interference with spellcasting). In some systems, the act of casting requires precise movements. In FullMetal Alchemist, it requires the drawing of symbols. The act of spellcasting itself can be used to limit what is possible. FMA had a rather liberal system which allowed the kinds of actions which are "world-breaking", in your sense, but that lack of discipline is not at all forced for every system. Conclusion Basically, any rules you like can be tamed with the appropriate costs put into place. Just ask yourself: "How can I become a Warren Buffet Mage with this magic system?" If the answer is: "Not very easily at all", then it will probably work for your story. Otherwise, add handicaps until the marginal utility of a mage is just a little higher than a well-trained knight, and you will be well on your way to success! 

Metal Scarcity If your civilization lives on metal-poor worlds, then ships could simply be the most expensive investment of rare metals that they can muster. This would make them effectively flying treasure chests. This eliminates metal-based missiles (let alone ballistics), which would also be too expensive to fire disposably, and also explains why ships aren't humongous (or interstellar, if you also want that limitation). The ships could use chemical propulsion using the abundant gases of their solar systems, and could be manned by biological marines who are also cheap and plentiful relative to the scarce metals. The ships themselves could utilize as much biological materials as possible to minimize the usage of their [literally] precious metals. Many lasers require crystals made of metals (e.g., ruby, semiconductor, etc.). Gas lasers (e.g., CO2) do not require metal per se, but it might be the case that focusing optics are too metal-expensive to make them worthwhile, or the power requirements are too high given the power density available. Or, they may be used, but are only powerful enough for limited point-defense. Solar Origin While we take it for granted that rocky planets and asteroids/comets are abundant, this is not true for all stars and all times. Small stars would not be capable of creating heavy elements, and early stars would not benefit from prior supernovae seeding heavy elements. Just take a look at the nucleosynthesis article on Wikipedia. Your star system(s) could be first- or second-generation small-to-medium stars, and thus very metal-poor. Tactics Thus, nuclear weapons may simply be infeasible, if the societies lack radionuclides, or the power densities required to ignite fusion (which on earth currently requires heavy radionuclides like U and Pu). Explosives are possible, but the delivery mechanisms would be fragile, as nobody could afford metal-shielded missiles. Electronics would also be rare, expensive, and valuable (until they got to carbon nanotubes). Even if a large missile were possible, the last thing any side would want to do is obliterate and disperse a flying gold box to the four winds. The best possible outcome is to capture a ship as intact as possible, minus the crew, of course. Thus, the battles would revolve around crew combat and possibly bio/chem warfare. And, of course, the easiest way to disable a ship without guns, torpedoes or missiles is to use the sturdiest object available: your own ship, hence, ramming. In fact, ships may not even bother with ramming. The recognition of the intrinsic value of each ship may lead to near-ceremonial warfare where the ships come alongside each other, and the crews disembark and fight in space, with the winner laying claim to both ships. Perhaps ramming is a tactic used by ships with inferior/understaffed crews, to compensate for weaker crew combat, or by pirates/privateers. Of course, each captain would have to decide whether the other side is willing to fight crew-to-crew or would rather take chances with ramming. Ramming would probably require a smaller crew complement for ships designed to do so, and there is a rich space of trade-offs for speed, maneuverability, crew size, cargo size, and armor. It's very possible that navies would field ships covering many points in this design space to accommodate multiple strategies, depending on the current warfare meta-game. Conclusion Note that this setting does not require religion or special culture to enforce the rules. Mutual self-interest will dictate behavior. The only difficulty with this setting is the plausibility of intelligent life from population II or III stars. Even if you wish to set the story near our current time, there are plenty of places to find a contemporary population II star, such as out by the galactic halo.
