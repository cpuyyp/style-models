Self-policing incentive, in theory, works similarly for both Value Added Tax (VAT) and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The improvement, however, could come from the reduction in the number of instances where suppliers can circumvent the self-policing system, to evade taxes. VAT is collected by every supplier in the supply chain and paid by every buyer in that supply chain. At every incidence of tax there is an opportunity for tax fraud. One example of VAT fraud is: the supplier provides an invalid VAT number on the invoice and collects the appropriate amount of VAT from the buyer and instead of transferring the collected tax to the government, the supplier pockets it. Of course, such fraud can be detected by the customs department and when audited the supplier may claim that there was a printing error in the VAT number on the invoice. But if suppliers are not audited (perhaps because the cost outweighs the benefit) then they can plausibly pocket all the tax they collected from the buyer. It is also plausible that such a fraud can be carried out by many suppliers, if not every supplier, in the supply chain. Hence, even though there is self-policing mechanism fraud can still be committed by one or more suppliers in the supply chain under the VAT regime. In contrast, under the GST regime there is only one supplier in the supply chain who can theoretically commit that tax fraud. Since there are less instances under GST to evade taxes it is plausible that the amount evaded will be less and that it would be easier to audit. 

Sorry for asking a homework question, however, I'll try to generalize it as much as possible for a future use. There are two complementary goods (A and B). B is produced under perfect competition, while A is produced under monopoly (yes, and A and B are produced by separate companies). The customers have a combined demand curve for both (as they don't need A without B or B without A) that can be expressed by a particular demand function. Of course, each product has its production cost functions c(A) and c(B). It looks like a classic textbook "nuts and bolts" case, where Q(a)=Q(b) and prices must be consistent (basically the equilibrium price there is the intersection of both demand curves), however, there's one big difference. The good A is purchased only one time while B can be purchased two, three or more times (the good A may be a CD player and good B a music CD). The example asks how should the monopolist who produces A behave if he wants to maximize his profits. The standard approach of drawing the two demand curves for A and B does not work here as the only quantity of product A that can be purchased is 1. Alternatively, the straightforward way of monopoly pricing (solving MR=MC for Q and then determining the P(Q)) does neither, as we can't ignore the good B and the only Q(A) available is 1. The solution must be simple enough, but I really got stuck and will appreciate any help or guiding advice. Paul 

Yes, your thinking about solvency and liquidity is in the right direction. An easier way to think about them is: Liquidity means that a bank has enough resources to meet its obligations and Solvency means the bank owns more than it owes. Lending to solvent but illiquid banks is a less risky thing to do for the central bank because the bank needs more liquidity at the moment but it owns enough long-term assets to repay the debt. Bagehot was the first to publicise this insight. It is called Bagehot's rule. Lending to insolvent banks (banks that owe more than they own) may be risky because it's long-term assets are significantly limited for the bank to repay this debt. This has the potential to cause a moral hazard because the bank is likely to come back to borrow more from the central bank in the future. 

If a government owes money to domestic or foreign entities and does not repay that debt then the government's credibility -- just like any other borrowing entity's credibility -- as a reliable economic entity takes a hit. As a consequence when it wants to borrow more money in the future, the lending entities either charge a higher interest rate to cover the risk or refuse to lend to avoid the risk altogether. The only difference, of course, governments can print their own currency unlike other entities. But too much currency in circulation will cause inflation, which is bad for the economy. So it is in the government's own interests to repay it's debt (as it is to borrow money in the first place). 

No, you are not indifferent unless there is a mandatory repayment schedule. This is a riskless contract to you otherwise. If there is no better rate of return for you, then you begin to repay the loan, but if a new opportunity develops at $R'>R$ then you stop repaying the loan. If there is no mandatory repayment schedule then you would always opt for the loan as you can require the bank to keep a bad opportunity and you can keep any good opportunity. In periods where $R$ is the superior opportunity, you repay the loan until it is fully repaid. In periods where $R'$ dominates the original opportunity, you send the cash flow into the new opportunity. The loan is acting as if it were a free option contract. There is an implicit cost to not taking the loan. None of this necessarily holds if there is a repayment schedule or if there is a loan rate of return which does not equal $R$. As to bonds, again it is the terms and conditions that matter. In the real world bonds are costly to issue. It appears here that bonds and bank loans are identical so you would be indifferent to using a bond or a loan, but not indifferent to buying the firm on credit since the bank or bondholders will accept taking all of the risk for the return $R$. If the return $R$ were risky and there were cash repayment obligations, then it is difficult to determine if you would be indifferent or prefer to borrow because the option requires exercise making it a forward contract and not an options contract unless there is also the capacity to prepay. You would be strictly indifferent if and only if there existed a mandatory principal repayment scheme. Otherwise, assuming that at the moment, no opportunity $R'>R$ existed, then you would take the loan and buy the firm. This entirely depends upon the bank accepting the profit of the firm as the interest payment. This would never happen in the real world.
