Socrates was pressured to answer the question "what motivation do I have to be good (or just) if I have Gyges' ring?" 2500 years ago, which he fudged with misdirection: "Hey, Let's look at justice in a bigger context (the just nation)." So I do not assume there will be the answer to your question. Your impression that any system of morality is either akin to a religion or backed by a religion sounds right to me. Spinoza, for instance, believed that the study of ethics is deductive by virtue of the properties of the god. Kant's moral system is incomplete without the postulation of the retribution in afterlife. John Rawls believed that any moral system is like a religion in that people holding different moral theories would never be able to reconcile their differences. Rawls thus called any theory of the good (moral theories as well as religions) a comprehensive doctrine. 

Appendix (Hopefully this appendix has some use value, unlike the one in human body whose only function is to blow up) 

If the sentences are used as propositional attitudes, the truth value does differ depending on whether one knows x_1 = x_2 or not. Lois Lane believes that Superman is awesome. (True) Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is awesome. (False) Lois Lane does not know that Superman = Clark Kent, so, to her, 'Superman is awesome' and 'Clark Kent is awesome' express different thoughts, and thus different truth values. 

Practicing 禮, according to Xunzi, is the way to transform our nature: from the innate evil tendency to the acquired, good characters. The question is, "Where does the first master come from?", or more precisely, "How the person discovered 禮, given that there were no other masters to teach him 禮 and that he himself should have been innately evil?" Xunzi almost answered this question with his famous metaphor of crossing a treacherous river. To cross the river, someone should have placed marks to indicate where is safe to step on. To Xunzi, the person who puts the marks is a master, marks are 禮, and the treacherous river is the innate human nature. When we follow the marks in the river, we will safely cross the river. Likewise, when we practice 禮, we will live peacefully and harmoniously together. Xunzi maintains: 

Let us formulate our question slightly easier. For our sleeping minds. Can a NON omnipotent being create a block that he can not lift and then lift it? Surprising answer is YES. I poor water in my bath and alas it is 120 liters - I can no lift it! Then i walk around in circles year or more discussing with myself how bad and humiliating it is to be a NON omnipotent being. Suddenly, one night i get a vision in a dream about Archimedes lever. I get out, construct a lever and LIFT my bath tube. After this example we can ask ourselves - ARE WE omnipotent or NOT? The big discovery of reason is that WE can NOT tell if we ourselves are NON omnipotent. Most important is that omnipotence with all its glory and countless pleasures asks US very important question - What IS Potence (power in Latin)? Which REAL absolute powers we have? They can be invisibly small but they have to be absolute. PS: from my example it is clear that idea of time is important in reasoning about what can be done (NOW) and what not. 

Here you are slightly abusing logic. 2 omega is not 1 omega by "ABSOLUTE" value they are same by the ORDER of magnitude, which means it is same Type of infinity. So by order of magnitude yes you are correct they will be at the same time. But by "ABSOLUTE" value of time B will be slower. It is a question of a debate/thinking/research how to operate with infinity. Clearly what is possible is to compare ORDER of infinities magnitude but not EXACT absolute value, which based on this example ALSO may exist. 

First of all - we ALL feel same way. Everything will be great. There will be new people and new ideas. Just give it some time. Shortly: Fear is there to awaken us and make us think (make us better beings). Fear is there to make you aware that you have BODY. The origin of fear is god. 

He is talking about what you can call in modern terms -- spirit. He is saying that connecting(understanding) with the body is the way to comprehend that spirit. Then he is saying that spirit's logic is superior to what you call brain thinking/conventional wisdom. In last sentence he is saying that your body needs actually totally different wisdom than the one you are hearing in your head. That's why people whole life struggle - because REAL wisdom of their life(what is actually going to happen with them) is different from the wisdom they "think/hear/bear/perceive" inside their head. Nitzsche wrote that this book is for no one and for everyone. No one means that you will NOT UNDERSTAND (even if you think you did) what he said - until you will reach the same level of development. For everyone means that nevertheless you may need to hear what is ahead. Good example - father tells his son that life is hard. Did son understood that life is hard? - No! he does not comprehend yet all the troubles he is about to encounter. But father should tell him about this anyway. 

The student forces a false dilemma (and false dichotomy) on you, as Dan Bron suggests. You feel you are in a dilemma: either you have to make slides available in advance, which you don't want to (it appears to me), or you might be viewed as a bad lecturer by the student who sent you the email. Luckily you are not in the dilemma because the student's reasoning is based on false dichotomy. 

Conclusion: From 9 and 3, there is no duty to CSR. Philosophers of business ethics believe that Friedman's argument is unsound, and have been trying to show that some of his assumptions are wrong. 

I will address questions relating only the latter two in this post ("What do political philosophies aim for?", and "Why do people believe in political philosophies?" which I interpret as "What is the use of political philosophy for the general public". The first question has its own big philosophical answers (through the perfectionism vs. neutralism debate). The aim of political philosophers The aim of political philosophy is to have clear understanding of words that occur frequently in the political society. These are some such words: legitimacy, authority, coercion, power and force. Political philosophers want to understand what these words mean, and when they settle with the meaning of the words, they want to know what can be entailed from their conceptions of the words. The reason that political philosophy generates so many contradicting theories is that they understand the words differently. Even when they share the meaning, they deduce different ideas form the shared meaning. Take the word 'authority' for example. What image does the word conjure up in you mind? A bank robber that wields a gun and you do what he says under duress; or, the benevolent yet stoic father whose sole concern is the well-being of his son? The first image was that of Hobbes; the latter, that of Locke. These paradigm images of authority have produced many irreconcilable, conflicting theories of political philosophy. Even when they share the same image, political philosophers deduce different conclusions. Hobbesians (Robert Ladenson) and anarchists (John Simmons) share the bank-robber image of authority. Naturally they think the authority of the government is founded on brute de facto military and police force. To them there is no moral distinction among authority, coercion, power and force. The government and its laws have no moral power over us. That is, it is unlike morality and moral laws that do have moral power over us, and we feel certain sense of duty to obey them. People under the political authority obey laws out of prudence and fear of punishment. Hobbesians and anarchists however disagree on the right of the government to make laws and punish law-violators (This right is called the right to rule, which many, but not unanimously, equate with legitimacy). Hobbesians think all governments are legitimate since consent from the peoples was given (The Hobbes’ social contract). Anarchists however argue that the consent was not given, thus concluding that all governments are illegitimate. Similarly, both Locke and Socrates share the image of the good father for authority. So both agree that, just as we have the moral duty to obey the commands of our fathers, we have the duty to obey the laws of our governments. A disobedient citizen amounts to an insolent child. The two however disagree on the extent of obedience. To Locke, the duty of obedience is presumptive. When the gov passes bad laws (and harm the people continuously, instead of benefiting them), people have the right to revolt. Not to Socrates, and you know how he ended his life. The use of political philosophy To almost all people, important words relating to political philosophy conjure up some images in their mind. But they do not have the luxury of (home work) time to think about whether the images they associate with the word are tenable, or what further ideas would follow from the images they hold. They might be persuaded to change their images once they realize that their images lead to a conclusion that they do not accept. Political philosophers do this homework so that you have resources to address clear and imminent policy questions arising from the sheer fact that we all are political animals. 

I will attempt to create a philosophy of stupidness here in this post. Let us start from a simple question - is there stupidity? From billions of good and not so good answers we arrive at the conclusion that stupidity DOES exist. Second, let us continue with the question - is there NO stupidity? From billions of good and not so good answers we arrive at the conclusion that stupidity does NOT exist. On this solid ground i base my philosophy of stupidity. Stupidity is a fundamental ingredient of the universe which both exist and does not exist. Stupidity is very closely linked to the question of existence of others. When others do not exist they become stupid, because only existence brings light. On the other hand when others start to exist they can not be stupid, because only existence brings light. Same fundamental method applies to God. If he exists he can not be stupid. On the other hand if God does not exist then he is stupid because he could not achieve existence. After that brilliant discoveries i also see dual connection between stupidity and existence. When existence is there stupidity is not, and when stupidity is there existence is not. Right from here it becomes clear that sleep is stupid because it deprives us from existence. Furthermore my philosophy of stupidness offers a correct interpretation of classical philosophers. For example famous Descartes - "Cogito ergo sum" really means - "I exist therefor i am not stupid" My philosophy of stupidity is so fundamental (stupid, as a dual counterpart to existence) that it even applies to itself. When others reject my philosophy it proves how correct it is, on the other hand when others accept it it deprives it from the object of study. Stupidity is so fundamental that i had to base my philosophy of it on it itself . That is why it is clearly visible that in some parts of the text author is there and in others we lost him. 

Looks like quality is some kind of mix between conventional beauty(form, craftsmanship) and functional beauty (efficiency, mathematical beauty of underlying algorithms, inner engineering). Like with any other beauty i think quality is synonymous to the word - outsanding. Thus giving it a very broad range of parameters in which it can outstand competitors. Regarding your question - yes there are philosophical theories. In your search you found one of the sanest philosopher of all times. Who really wanted to help humans now. Karl Marx. His name is overshadowed by idiots, but he himself is very good. He discusses what is value(quality, because quality affects value) in his great book Capital. Get it right now and start reading or listening (there are audio versions). Right at the beginning of the Volume 1 he discusses your question. Last but not least do not be afraid of him because of historical brainwashing - when asked by journalist Karl Marx said - "I am anything but Marxist!"
