The question is too broad to answer completely (to start with, it presupposes a shibboleth to distinguish formal theories of syntax), but the answer is easy for minimalism. The comment in the question does not apply to minimalist syntax in that minimalist syntax does not assume that the leaves of a syntax tree must necessarily host words. On the other hand, it does argue for common structural features in all languages. So the short answer to "How is syntax of polysynthetic languages represented in minimalism?" is "just like the syntax of non-polysynthetic languages." This area of research has been very active for the last 20 years, so there is no dearth of material to study if you want to know more. I guess the classical reference is The Polysynthesis parameter and I'm personally familiar with the work of M.Barrie but there are dozens of other references. As Ivan Kapitonov notes in comments, pro-drop is not exclusive to polysynthetic languages. As it is one of the most studied syntactic phenomenon, you'll have no difficulty to find work on this topic either. 

I should add, of course, that the UTAH is just the null-hypothesis. Of course, many syntactic phenomena (ergativity, experiencer verbs...) do not fit well with it and are the objects of many interesting debates (see these notes of Idan Landau for a first introduction to some of these debates). 

Your question seems to presuppose the framework of minimalist syntax as it has been practiced in the last 20 years, so my answer is in this framework as well. In this framework, categories like N, D and T are not primitive but should rather be considered as convenient placeholders for common configurations of syntactic features. Now a tension inevitably appears: either you define T (and the rest) by such a specific configuration, or you choose to call T the syntactic object that actually occurs in your language of study closest to the usual configuration. Under the first choice, then the answer of your question depends on your definition of N and T, but usual choices will preclude the movement you imagine (N is not supposed to be able to probe, and even if were, it is unclear to me what it could possibly probe in T). If you go the second route, then it all depends on your choice of language and like curiousdannii, I'd be interested in specific examples. Now, based on the few hints that you provide, I imagine that you are interested in genitive subjects in relative clause in Turkic languages. I base my answer on the case of Turkish, which is the only situation I understand (even to a limited extent). In that case, you can notice that the verb exhibits a nominalizing suffix before the agreement morpheme, so that the most straightforward explanation is head movement of V to a defective T (pseudo-nominalization) followed by movement of the subject to spec TP followed by an Agree operation with a nominal C for purpose of genitive Case assignment. This last Agree operation is typically not accompanied by movement as far as I can tell. This accounts is theoretically very different from the head movement you suggest but I will note that pseudo-nominalization followed by raising of the subject and Agree with a nominal C looks superficially very much like head movement of T to N, so perhaps this is indeed what you had in mind. If this is indeed what you had in mind, the way to tease out the two accounts is adverb placements: if T moves, then the subject should be able to surface to the right of T-adverbs; if the subject moves then agrees, it should be to the left of T-adverbs. Again, an example could help (and the works of Kornfilt seem to be a good reference). 

The answer to your question, properly generalized, is the object of much active research. Of course, one can make lists of verbs allowing active, unaccusative (or ergative) and mediopassive constructions in a given language, but the theoretical generalizations allowing one to predict what will be in these lists does not exist, as far as I know. To give a flavor of the difficulty, notice that given an appropriate context, French transitive verbs tend to accept a mediopassive construction, even those like kill which resist it strongly in Germanic languages. UPDATE: Contrast for instance I sell apples/I kill ants. Apples sell easily/*Ants kill easily. with Je vends des pommes/Je tue des fourmis. Les pommes se vendent bien/Les fourmis se tuent facilement. where the last sentence is perhaps a bit strange out of context but perfectly OK embedded in an appropriate discourse e.g J'ai de gros problèmes de fourmis dans mon jardin. Les fourmis noires sont absolument increvables mais heureusement les fourmis rouges se tuent assez facilement. (I have huge ant problems in my garden. Black ants are absolutely indestructible but fortunately red ants kill rather easily). This is even more so in other Romance languages (the Spanish equivalent of Ants kill easily, for instance, seems quite natural). On the other hand of the spectrum, all Japanese transitive verbs have an ergative form. For recent research on the topic, you can read the work of Artemis Alexiadou, for instance. 

It is of course hard to imagine a truly alien mind, but if you have some background in mathematics, you can envision a historical and conceptual development of mathematics truly different from what happened in any human civilization that we know of while remaining meaningful and intelligible to us. Consider for instance how an alien brain perceiving the world mostly though echolocation might envision geometry (my intuition, very feeble of course, would be that such a mind could consider blurring of periodic signals, and hence convolution and Fourier's theory, as much more intuitive than euclidean geometry). For a simpler example, consider an alien mind whose hardwired concept of number would lend itself more naturally to a modular interpretation than to a natural number interpretation (they would be counting in Z/nZ for some n, in effect, rather than in N), and if this seems too strange a thing to you, consider that this is essentially how computers count. On the other hand, the idea that even a strikingly different conceptualization of mathematics may lead to a re-evaluation of the correlation between mathematical formalization and experiment is too kantian for my taste: after all, our predictions tend to be quite accurate, and I don't see how perceiving the world in an alternate way could change that. In my opinion, the reason mathematics model the physical world so efficiently is that the physical world is by and large simple: a large number of phenomena can be correctly described using a handful of principles (minimize something) and (in fact equivalently, by Noether's theorem) a couple of symmetries. So descriptions of the physical world will involve simple rules, and the abstract study of simple rules is (almost by definition) what we call mathematics. A good way to discriminate the (mostly pragmatic) position I here defended and the kantian position is to notice that the record of mathematics is actually quite mixed: it is great for celestial mechanics (the historical impulse for the kantian position) and physics more generally, but mostly abysmal for biology. This could be quite mysterious from a kantian position, but is crystal clear from a pragmatic one: celestial mechanics is the by-product of essentially a single law, biology is the by-product of billions of years natural selection sieving trough random changes and so is very unlikely to admit a formalization through simple rules. Finally, because I would feel it inappropriate to clog linguistics.stackexchange with speculation on the cognitive and philosophical content of mathematics, let me mention that one of the core principle of current minimalist linguistic theory is that syntax is the by-product of the necessity of the structures constructed by a single operation (Merge) operating recursively to be legible by the so-called interfaces (for instance, the phonological interface). N.Chomsky, to which this belief about syntax is due, has contemplated in several publications (e.g here) the possibility that some higher arithmetical capabilities of the human brain (those going further that the elementary ones discussed above) might stem from a recycling of this merge operation in other cognitive context: informally, he suggests that perhaps human beings are so talented at manipulating recursive abstract structures (natural numbers, algorithms...) because our linguistic ability is based on a recursive operation. 

extremely hard to understand (and yet it is so famous that I knew most of the exchange beforehand), and in particular much harder to understand than anything Les Visiteurs say in the film (but who doubted that about a comedy marketed at families?). That said, I do understand most of it and many French can read these texts fluently. More generally, I find that the main difficulty I encounter when reading texts from that period is that I don't know the exact meaning of a couple of grammatical words or constructions (so that I'm not quite sure whether the sentence is, for instance, hypothetical or assertive). The syntax is very odd but completely understandable and the vocabulary is a mixed bag, with the overwhelming majority of the words at least ringing a bell, but with a fair number of them having manifestly a slightly different meaning that the one I am used to. Based on this, I would say that an educated native speaker of French would probably require only a few days of training to be able to follow a conversation in XIIth century French, but that the first encounter would probably be quite puzzling. UPDATE: So, there is a very easy to find out. I asked a friend with a PhD in Old French to read once the text above at normal delivery speed to a group of twelve students (age 18 and 19) with no prior knowledge of Old French (a few of them even wondered afterwards what the language was, but a few others volunteered that it was a tale of knighthood in Old French), nor in fact of Medieval literature (as evidenced by the fact that none recognized the text even after I provided the translation, even though it is a relatively famous scene from the most famous work of Chrétien de Troyes). They were allowed to share what they had understood afterward. This is what they got.
