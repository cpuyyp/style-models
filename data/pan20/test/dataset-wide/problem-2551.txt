We ask a question when we do not know. To some questions the answer is definite and there is no other interpretation and it accords with the Buddha's dhamma. To other questions of morality/ethic (sila) then it is relative to the person. Buddhist monks keep the 227 rule; 8 preceptors, the 8 precepts; and ordinary people, 5 precepts. Even within the first precept of "abstaining from killing" we practice according to our ability...do we kill mosquitoes that spread malaria, etc.. The Buddha knows so he only asks questions so he may show the error of other peoples answer inorder to teach. That is one of his many teaching methods. 

The feeling of pride is okay in the sense that it is conditioned so long as you do not act following that feeling. That you are able to notice the arising of the feeling shows some mindfulness and restraint. Conceit is one of the 10 fetters to be abandoned by an Anagami, the last stage of the practice. So long as you are not holding on to that pride or perpetuating it you are doing fine. To stop pride & conceit from arising don't compare! 

"Is it considered canon by all or most of Theravadan schools?" A few Evidences on the Age of the Kathavatthu showed that an examination of some of the materials of the K. V. and the Asokan edicts shows that the compilation of the K. V. was made, at least in part, somewhere in the reign of king Asoka. Kathavatthu‘The Book of Disputed Points’, being a canonical book belonging to the Abhidharma Piṭaka of the Pāli Canon. "How did the post-theravadan schools regard the texts?" Below are quotes on the Kathavatthu from wiki: (*I added bold to show emphasis) 

There are so many stupas (pagodas as you call them which are chinese versions of stupas) which architectural meanings are never recorded, they are symbols for the viewer to interpret, especially the modern ones. Symbolism from Wikipedia "The shape of the stupa represents the Buddha, crowned and sitting in meditation posture on a lion throne. His crown is the top of the spire; his head is the square at the spire's base; his body is the vase shape; his legs are the four steps of the lower terrace; and the base is his throne."[7] Five purified elements Although not described in any Tibetan text on stupa symbolism, the stupa may represent the five purified elements:[8] 

(I’ll refer to Note 1 to it later). I do not have access to Peter Harvey’s views. But in the Brahma-nimantanika Sutta(MN49) translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, there is a description of “'Consciousness without surface, endless, radiant all around” and in his Note no. 9 in MN49 he argues that: 

When there is awareness, there is mindfulness and clear comprehension of the situation, which is, the thinking, speaking and acting, which continues the way it is because it is conditioned; but because there is this clear comprehension, there is this "pause", "space" to breathe before we commit to the thinking, speaking and acting, allowing the mind to depart from the conditioning. It is just like a mother watching over the child, doing her thing and only making the child more aware of what she is doing, so she contemplates before doing anything. The mother (awareness, sati-sampajanna) is one thing, the child (mind, vinnana) is another, eventually. In the beginning of the practice, awarenes is patchy; and the thing that interrupts thoughts in the mind is not the awareness itself but the thought to re-establish awareness again and the act of re-establishing this awareness. So in the beginning these interruptions are distracting but soon they are reduced depending on one's progress. One can learn, create and be absorbed with the awareness attending, and that learning, creating and absorbing is much more intense and wholesome. 

I remember reading once, disciples of Sariputta were going out into the world and he ask them the question: "Friend what if someone ask you is the world eternal or is not eternal". Then his passed his disciples when they just quote Dependent Origination "depending on contact, feeling arises, depending on feeling, craving arises..etc.. I'm trying to look for that sutta again. Anybody know which sutta is it or my memory has been corrupted, there never was such a sutta. 

The Buddha advised: "These are the five facts that one should reflect on often, whether one is a woman or a man, lay or ordained."[5] The Upajjhatthana Sutta translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu The actual gatha for chanting itself. 

DO starts with Depending on Ignorance, mental volition arise, depending on volitions consciousness arise, depending on consciousness, name & form, depending on name & form 6 sense base, depending on 6 sense base contact..etc.. It is commonly accepted (?) that the re-birth linking consciousness(patisandhi) descends into the foetus around 6 months. At that stage of DO the resultant(vipaka) consciousness from previous existence give rise to name & form, which give rise to 6 sense base. These stages are when our form and senses are conditioned according to our resultant consciousness. The quality and characteristics of our senses etc... Until the 6 sense base become functional and there is a sense object then only is there contact, feeling and the rest of DO. So things like people playing music for the yet to be born baby to listen to, do make sense when the ear base is developed. That's my take on it. 

Depending on contact, feeling arises, depending on feeling, rapture (piti) & pleasure (sukha) arises, accompanied by direct thought (vitakka) and evaluation(vicara) - first jhanna factors. With that he abandons passion (*becomes an Arahant). And as he thus nurses this yearning for the unexcelled liberations, there arises within him sorrow based on that yearning (disenchantment). With that he abandons irritation(*becomes an Anagami). ..enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. With that he abandons ignorance(* becomes an Arahant). 

I am interested in what many ways Adhimokkha(determination) is used in meditation or other purposes in different traditions. 

Happiness, Pain, Pleasure, Displeasure, Equanimity, Confidence, Effort, Mindfulness, Concentration, Wisdom, 

Bhavanga, Pabhassara-cita and Nibbana (Theravadin perspective from Ajahn Mun's Thai forest tradition) To get from bhavanga, pabhassaara to nibbana and understand how kamma effects are stored in the present and transmigrated to the future we have to explore some terms. What happens in-between times when we are not thinking, when we are in a dreamless sleep? Is there still the arising and falling of consciousness (citta)? In this tradition there is the bhavanga-citta which arise after the rebirth-linking consciousness (patisandhi-citta) that form the “life-continuum” in the next existence. 

MVFWIW is if you are new to Buddhism then it is advisable to learn about the authentic teachings first and when you have cultivated wisdom and faith then to challenge that faith and wisdom with controversies. As it is Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana have provided enough divergent materials for your wisdom and faith to work on. 

You have very strong concentration but your mindfulness is lacking behind. Every time you fix your mind on an area the concentration takes over and because you have strong sensations in the eyes your concentration takes you back to the eyes. The solution is to scan faster whereby you increase your mindfulness and not let concentration zoom in. When you have succeeded to prevent going back to the eyes then slowly slow down your scan. You may have to start to scan as fast as a Xerox machine. 

There is another fear which results from the practice of vipassana as pointed out by eudoxus: Knowledge of fear - bhaya-nana 

So if we practice jhanas (ecstasies), which is a weighty action (garuka kamma), we are destined to have that as the death nimitta, and reborn in the Brahma realm, unless other garuka kamma nimmitta intervenes. 

One of the controversies and many others were concerned with attribution of the work of Abhidhamma and that some books contained errors "4. Paramatthadipani-Tika, "The Elucidation of the Ultimate Meaning," by Ledi Sayadaw. Ledi Sayadaw of Burma (1846-1923) was one of the greatest scholar-monks and meditation masters of the Theravada tradition in recent times. He was the author of over seventy manuals on different aspects of Theravada Buddhism, including philosophy, ethics, meditation practice, and Pali grammar. His tika created a sensation in the field of Abhidhamma studies because he pointed out 325 places in the esteemed Vibhavini-tika where he alleged that errors and misinterpretations had occurred, though his criticisms also set off a reaction in defense of the older work." Excerpts of some of the controversies 

My attempts: First of all on interference which means action: "'I am the owner of my actions (kamma), heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir'... "A disciple of the noble ones considers this: 'I am not the only one who is owner of my actions, … Whatever they do, for good or for evil, to that will they fall heir.' When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth. He/she sticks with that path, develops it, cultivates it. As he/she sticks with that path, develops it and cultivates it, the fetters are abandoned, the obsessions destroyed." — AN 5.57 So non-interference arises through cultivating the path. "And what is the cessation of kamma? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma; and just this noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma. "Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns kamma in this way, the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way, ... .. The path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known.' Thus it has been said, and in reference to this was it said." — AN 6.63 Non-interference comes through desiring cessation of contact to cessation of kamma. The most noble of all (actions)kamma is ending of kamma. When then can there be inteference? When one is fully enlightened i.e. when ones actions do not lead to any further kamma, and those actions are performed from metta, karuna, mudita. To interfere means that one has a view on things and when one can be sure that the view created, is not from ignorance, then one can interfere. Needless to say acting out of compassion is skilful etc. but not the path of the noble disciples but path of the bodhisattva. Any why is non-interference desirable? From following it an arahant may arise that would benefit multitudes. That’s my take on it.
