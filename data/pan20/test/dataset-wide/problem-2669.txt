One reason you might find this interesting is if we draw a distinction between Logic as a mathematical field of study and the philosophical study of the foundations of Argumentation. Whatever you might want to say about the apparent formal restrictiveness of the idea of an indicative conditional, there appears to be something incredibly potent about many of the old Aristotelian Syllogism rules that defies a purely formal account. Specifically, I'm thinking about the convincing nature of Modus Ponens arguments; that is, arguments of the form: 

Avis's argument appears a Valid (but Unsound) Deduction to me. So how is it an Appeal to Pity? Premise 1: If Avis is #2, then Avis will improve to be #1. Premise 2: If Avis is #1, then you should choose Avis. Conclusion. 3: You should choose Avis. 

I recognise the possible problem that I coloured grey in the above quote; but how is it a genuine problem? And why does it necessitate EI always to precede UI? I agree that writing EI before UI is visually convenient, but does the grey above exaggerate? To me, the can be evaded simply by knowledge of EI vs UI. Only US (Line 1) are true for ANY value of x; so only US empower you to choose whatever Constant (ie: letter) you need, such as the specific Constant needed to match the Constants in any subsequent PS. One must start always by applying EI to the ES (Line 2) which generates the first Constant, before one can even know which Constant needs to be matched from applying UI to the US. So knowing the previous sentences, how can someone be confused by whether the 'something' in EI is identical to what is named in the UI? If they are not identical, then EI and UI would use different Instantial Letters to name the 'something'! 

Cohen's results although logical are properly mathematical consequences, rather than logic; Cohen via Godel had managed to get a certain amount of the way in using tactics in pure logic, but needed to step outside for additional power to get his interesting results in his classification of mathematical structures. The notion of mathematical truth seems to be a very particular species of truth once you get beyond a certain accepted kernel of logic (this would be in line with Hilbert's ideas about the role of consistency proofs of theories defined over finite arithmetic). If this is right, then the idea that we have "settled" on first order classical predicate logic can be considered consistent with Cohen's reflections on the vast plurality to be found in set theory, because what we agree on and what logic in abstraction from strictly mathematical content can decide for us is that stable finite core that all of the possible models accept. That would be my way of lending some credence to the thesis that logic has in some sense been properly formalized. But maybe that's not all there is to say; maybe we might want further to consider that we can add more logical structuring and higher cardinals to talk about degrees of truth according to how typical some propositions are across the various forcing extensions that we might come across. If you want to check out some of this more esoteric analysis, you could do worse than checking out some of the ideas in Woodin's Ω-logic (Bagaria et al have an advanced Primer for further reading). 

Why is the bolded true? To me, [1.] (belief in the line's sharpness) contradicts [2.] (disbelief of the line's importance), because if a line between science and philosophy really matters not for philosophy, then: why is there a line at all, and why did the natural sciences (and maths and other independent subjects now) separate from philosophy? 

Suppose that more occurrences exist for MoA and MoD than for JM. How do multiple applications of MoA and MoD overpower JM? JM reveals both the NCs and SCs. Same question as 1, but now suppose the same quantity of occurrences for all 3 Methods. 

A more profitable line might be something like this: Interpretation as a relation between two things has a domain and an image. The domain is the collection of sense data. What is the image? If the solipsist thinks the only possible thing the image can be is a series of mental states, then the onus is on the solipsist to explain why mental states are not facts, where a fact is supposed to be "the states that compose the world that are what are demonstrated in the interpretation of sense data". A more philosophically sophisticated version of broadly this line was proposed by Hilary Putnam in his response to the "Brain in a Vat" skeptical scenario. For Putnam, the key move that the skeptic makes is in getting me to accept a dichotomy that I cannot possibly be in a position to understand. If I am indeed nothing more than a brain in a jar in some mad scientist's laboratory, such that the only experiences I have are those that are fed directly into my brain through either some complex computer simulation or even just some highly regular sequence of electric shocks, then how in the world can I ever be in a position to understand what it means for something to be a brain in the sense in which I am a brain in this scenario? All I ever form thoughts about are elements of the computer simulation, or the results of random electrical discharges etc. So it's just plainly false for me to say, even in the skeptical scenario, that I'm a brain in a vat. The stuff of the world that I live in is what I'm talking about and what constitutes a particular notion for me of what "the facts" are, regardless of whether there is a distorting filter between my interpretation and some abstract hypermetaphysical "Reality". That's not to say everything I refer to is a psychological fabrication - we only acquire reference in response to the world that we encounter, and for Putnam the key point is that we are causally connected to the parts of the world that we take to constitute our facts. Of course, this is a kind of Antirealism about the world, because even though there remains a sensible notion of "the facts", this comes at the expense of a notion of a fixed domain of mind-independent and ultimately metaphysically "real" things. But, if we accept some of the ideas about how language works as presented by Frege and Wittgenstein, the idea that Facts, rather than things, are primary to us opens up the possibility that we can hold on to factiveness without surrendering ground to the skeptic.

I see that 2 is the Assumption for the Conditional Proof, but it already provides you with 2. So why write 3 and 4, which appear completely redundant? After 1, I would have written only:    | 2. T    ACP 3. T → T      2, CP.    QED. 

Suppose it is raining, but because I am inside, I am not getting wet. What this demonstrates is that it is not the case that if it is raining then I am wet. That's because we've identified a case where it is raining (the left hand side of the implication is true) but where I am not wet (the right hand side of the implication is false). But we haven't thereby shown that it's not the case that if I am wet, then it is raining. That's because I'm not wet, so our current example doesn't tell us anything about what happens when I am. Suppose I'm wet, because I've just fallen into a pool, but it's a sunny day out. This demonstrates the converse - that it is not the case that if I am wet then it is raining - since we've found a case where I am wet (the left hand side of the implication is true) but it's not raining (the right hand side of the implication is false). This, on the other hand, doesn't show that if it is raining then I am wet, because it's not raining, so we aren't usefully informed about what the consequences are of it raining.

1. How and why does this trick work to validate an argument? 2. Since the standard form of an argument helps me understand, where would this tricky premise be inserted? For example: 

How does 6 rebut 5 (Russell's objection)? 6 only restates the Conclusion above which (I presume) Russell would have read already. Do the Coherentists rebut 4? 6 does not explain how to preclude a falsehood from being believed. 

Well here's one reason: Noise. The mathematical God is unselective as regards the reality it creates, and generates vast, indefinitely extensible hierarchies that are filled with collections within collections, some of whom are enormously complex and specific and others of whom are simple, unitary or all-encompassing. Although the mathematical God conceives of the universe in totality in ways we might view as beautiful, that's not the full story of each of the various (also infinite) objects within that totality, and the mathematical God doesn't filter its creation to only contain those elements that are simple and binary. Arguably, that's what makes applied Maths so useful to us.
