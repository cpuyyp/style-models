The global climate models that are used to evaluate future climate scenarios are calibrated to reproduce the past ocean and atmospheric conditions, which includes trying to match the described salinity trend. They likely constitute the best source of future global salinity estimates. Their ocean salinity forecast is based on the estimation of the global hydrological cycle evolution, especially evaporation, precipitation, river discharge and ocean mixing. With regard to the quality of the salinity estimates, there is probably a large uncertainty associated with those fields. There is going to be substantial improvement in the quality of the salinity forecast because of the recent availability of better global salinity products. The remote data obtained from satellites (SMOS and Aquarius) have been providing a much better global view of salinity changes. Also, the ARGO profilers are expanding our understanding of the ocean interior. In terms of evaluating uncertainty, I like the approach of Meier et al., 2006 looking at multi-model ensemble estimates. They combined down-scaled regional models with global simulations under several scenarios and provided several metrics for salinity uncertainties. The relationship between forecast errors and forecast horizons is quite complex and in fact represents an entire field of study. There is a lot of information in the IPCC 2013 report dealing with prediction quality, ensemble generation and size, and forecast quality assessment (for instance Chapter 11). Source: Aretxabaleta et al. (2017) Using a little bit of self-promotion, I can also say that estimating what the current salinity trend from observations is a tough problem. In this recently published article, we show that the changes in trend are spatially complex and changing in time. We argue that, as mentioned before, the changes in salinity field give a good representation of the long-term changes in the global hydrological cycle. 

How can we determine the error associated with bathymetric measurements when we survey over submerged vegetation? Let's say we are using single-beam echo-sounder over a patch of Posidonia, what are the expected errors and how can we determine them? 

The equilibrium tide is a theoretical concept developed by Newton in the 17th century that considers only the gravitational pull by the Moon and the Sun and the centrifugal forces, with no inertia, no friction and no land masses. From the NOAA definitions: 

It seems that the material comes in large part from the Banc d'Arguin to the west through aeolian transport. The sand from the bank and adjacent areas is related to the material from the river Garonne to the north. 

First, to describe El Niño as a Pacific Ocean event seems overly simplistic. The effects of El Niño are felt worldwide as can be seemed by a principal component (EOF) analysis (e.g., Alexander et al., 2002). Also, using the term "El Niño" to describe the entire oscillation (ENSO, El Niño Southern oscillation) can lead to confusions as the term "El Niño" corresponds to one of the phases of the oscillation. The size of the Pacific Ocean and the lack of equatorial constraints makes it a prime candidate for large oceanic fluctuations such as ENSO. The large distance between the western and eastern sides of the basin allows for a more dynamic equilibrium with the presence of large scale waves (Kelvin and Rossby; e.g., Kirtman, 1997). This equilibrium can be altered by external (atmospheric) forcing resulting in the different modes of oscillation of ENSO. Apart from that, there are a number of significant modes of oscillations (see $URL$ for a very good list) that occur in basins outside the Pacific ocean. A good example is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Hurrel [1985, Science]; $URL$ that affects not only the North Atlantic but also the climate of Europe and North America. Other examples of modes of climate variability include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; Zhang et al., 1997), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Schlesinger & Ramankutty, 1994), or the Arctic Oscillation (AO; Thompson & Wallace, 1998). 

As for predictions of the future effects cause by emission scenarios, that seems to be an ongoing topic of research. A couple of good starting point might be Yeager et al. (2012) and the book chapter by Hurrell et al. (2013) on the effects of climate change on NAO. 

A set of banded clouds can be seen in MODIS imagery during several days in January and February over the Gulf of Maine. They tend to occur with very cold winds from the NW following storms. 

The Dune of Pilat (Dune du Pilat) is the tallest dune in Europe. The dune has been around for at least centuries. Where is the sediment coming from? Why is the dune so tall? 

They also provide an example from the Old Testament: Jericho, that was attack by invaders after the city walls collapse. A simple explanation of the potential set of events is given in this video. 

The top expression is basically the depth-averaged velocity. Meanwhile the second expression only applies to geostrophic flows. The depth-averaged velocity can be caused by many mechanisms, with the geostrophic balance being one of them. The most common ones are the wind and the tides (but also differences in atmospheric pressure, sloping bottoms, ...). Both tides and wind create a barotropic pressure gradient that has to be compensated by other forces in the Navier-Stokes equations, with friction being the most common one. The geostrophic balance is a specific solution of the NS equations that neglects the effects of friction and any other forces. John Wilkin (Rutgers) has some good notes on how to estimate these currents from observations. The barotropic pressure gradient is also the integral result for the entire water column. A good illustration is the thermal wind example: You need a difference in slope between isobaric (pressure) and isopycnal (density) surfaces to give you a baroclinic gradient. In theory in a barotropic fluid the flow is the same at all depths: $u(z)=u_{bt}$. Clearly, in practice, any fluid will have boundary layers in which that is not the case. 

I find the statement in the question difficult to believe.Tides have a pretty cyclical period and I doubt the resulting effect is a day-night difference unless only S1 and S2 tidal constituents are important in that location, which I find very unlikely. In fact, the portal $URL$ shows the high tide being larger during the day for the rest of the month of May 2018. That behavior changes in time as one would expect. The dominant frequencies at this location are diurnal tides (mostly a single high tide and low tide per day). The main diurnal tides have a period around 24 hours and in this case the dominant periods are slightly larger than 24 hours. You can download the hourly data from: $URL$ and the resulting time series goes from 1984 to now. Here is the time series for the year 2017. There is no time at which the tide "dissappears". 

In a way, glaciers are just like frozen rivers. A good start on that topic comes from USGS. Ice (whether in a frozen river or in a glacier) is still a fluid and thus is always moving because of its own weight. A frozen river will still be a river of incredibly slow moving water. When water is not moving, first the entire volume cools down to 4C (maximum density) as the colder water keeps sinking to the bottom. Then, a thin layer at the surface starts to freeze while floating on the denser water below. By contrast, in moving water, the entire volume has to cool to 0C before freezing starts. For any river to freeze, heat must be lost at a rate that exceeds the rate of replacement. Because of the high heat capacity of water, fast moving water (e.g., mountain cascades) will be more difficult to freeze because heat loss will be smaller than flow rate. Thus, slow moving small streams tend to freeze quickly. 

A good database of tectonic plates is available at the Institute for Geophysics of the University of Texas. The database includes present conditions and past and future conditions. They provide ASCII files in their ftp site. Source Another option is the data from Peter Bird at UCLA that he described in his article "An updated digital model of plate boundaries", $G^3$, 2003. He provides the data in ASCII format in their ftp site (they include a readme file with the description of the data). 

One option is to not load the entire file at a time. You can use ncgeodataset. The routine allows for the extraction of a subset of data without having to load the entire file or even an array into Matlab. It is great for large datasets. 

Every time I read a news article about Antarctic ice extent, I don't seem to have a clear answer as to what the deal is. If I look at the February sea ice extent from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), I get no trend that I can see: . If I look at the September data from NSIDC, then I get a clear increase.. NSIDC even tells you what the trend is. 

There are a couple of very cool animations on YouTube of the future supercontinent: Pangea Proxima. One is by Christopher Scotese (video) and the other is by Algol (YouTube or also a longer animation with a longer history). The PALEOMAP Project page contains a fair amount of information as to how they estimate the evolution. With regard to the future climate, that is a really tough question that I don't feel qualified to answer. Also, even though it does not include the future supercontinent, I really like the EarthViewer interactive tool. It has lots of information and it is very intuitive to use. 

An estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) is the area of an estuary that has maximum values in suspended particles in the water column. My questions are 

$K_1$ amplitude and phase from AVISO. The maximum $K_1$ amplitudes of around 0.4m are found south of Alaska and west of the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Sea of Okhotsk. The amplitude of the $P_1$ constituent is about half of $K_1$ with a maximum of around 0.2m in the Sea of Okhotsk. Overall, the effect of the tilt on tides is pretty minor relative to the rest of the effects. 

I am trying to set up a coastal ocean model simulation. I am looking for different ways to force the tidal boundary condition in the model to study how uncertainty in the tidal forcing in the boundary affects the model solution. What are the different tidal databases that people are currently using? 

The average proportion of naturally occurring semi-heavy water or deuterated water, $\ce{^2HHO}$ or $\ce{HDO}$, is about 1 molecule in 3200. The proportion comes from the fact that one hydrogen in 6400 is in the form of deuterium. The heavy water, $\ce{D2O}$, proportion is about 1 molecule in 41 million ($\ce{6400^2}$) as part of a dynamic equilibrium between normal water, semi-heavy and heavy water (water containing 50% H and 50% D, is in fact a balance between 25% of $\ce{H2O}$ and $\ce{D2O}$ and the rest is $\ce{HDO}$). I understand that the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) has a set proportion equal to the average proportion, but heavy water abundance changes slightly from one kind of water to another. My question is how much does it change? What oceans have a higher proportion of heavy water? As a hydrogen bond with deuterium is stronger than a normal one, would we expect any biological effects from the different abundances? 

Generating finite element/volume grids is tricky, especially when you are dealing with complex coastlines. What are the more common tools to create the grids and to check the quality (e.g., minimum angles, wave propagation constraints) of it? 

Meddies are anicyclonic (rotating clockwise) lenses of warm salty Mediterranean Water that travel through the North Atlantic between ∼500 and 1500 m depth. They are observed as large temperature, salinity and velocity anomalies (Richardson et al., 2000). Meddies are typically 40–100 km in diameter with their core being 500–1000 m thick. Meddies separate from the Mediterranean Undercurrent (the main Mediterranean outflow) as it flows through abrupt topographic changes like major canyons. Each year between 15–20 meddies are formed off southern Portugal predominantly at two sites (Bower et al., 1997): Cape St. Vincent (37° N) and Extremadura Promontory (39° N). They can be detected by their surface signature in surface temperature and sea level anomalies (Oliveira et al., 2000). A large percentage of the meddies formed collide with large seamounts decay while some travel west on the north side of the seamounts and then travel southwest near Cape St Vincent toward the Canary basin with translation speeds of a few cm/s and clockwise rotation periods of 4 to 6 days (Richardson et al., 2000). (P.L. Richardson: "Tracking Ocean Eddies", American Scientist 81, 261--271, 1993. Fig 10. $URL$ Meddies can have maximum salinities around 36.5 and maximum temperatures around 13°C and they are observed as large anomalies (salinity anomaly ~1 and temperature anomaly ~4 °C) as they travel westward into cooler and fresher water. During their trip, the Mediterranean water inside the meddy slowly mixes with the surrounding Atlantic water and the salt anomaly progressively weakens until the meddy dissipates. The main processes causing mixing occur at the boundary of a meddy where the largest gradients of temperature and salinity exist and are double-diffusion and thermohaline intrusions as large as 25 m thick (Meunier et al., 2015). From Tychensky et Carton, 1998. ($URL$ Meddies average lifespan is around 1.7 years although some were observed for more than 5 years (Richardson et al., 2000). During that time they travel distances up to one thousand kilometers and their maintained mostly because the core of the meddy tends to have a doubly-stable stratification (Armi et al., 1989). Up to 29 meddies may coexist in the North Atlantic at the same time (Richardson et al., 2000). From Univ. of Delaware ($URL$
