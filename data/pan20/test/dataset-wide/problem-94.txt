With so few draws, creating permanent outposts on even a dozen other planets within 20 years seems very improbable given the costs involved in just getting them habitable. Actually colonizing them, which I would interpret as having self-supporting environments in which people can live out a whole life-cycle, including pregnancy, birth and childhood... not very likely within the next 20 years for even one of them. So it seems to me that given the amount of hand-waving you'd need to do to get even a single colony established, even close by like on Mars or the Moon, the problem is definitely not in restricting the number and size of colonies, but rather in how you could convincingly get a colony to grow large enough to be interesting. 

This already happened. I married my wife, who I met on an MMO, and I am far from being the only person this has happened to. Many, many people meet on the Internet and fall for each other online, without their physical form being relevant. Even prior to that, it happened, with arranged marriages, marriages between those who had hitherto only been pen-pals, and so on and so forth. In a computer game like, say, Second Life, you have full control over your looks... and people's looks still vary. People's tastes still vary. With full control over your looks, your looks just become a full expression of your personality, rather than something over which you have at best only tangential control over. So in those environments, everyone's looks don't become homogeneously "perfect" because there is no one version of "perfect": instead, people become more unique, more different, each struggling to find the most different and standout version of "what makes me, me". Your "looks" (whether you're an insanely-endowed crocodile-man or a tinkerbell pixy who propels herself by farts) in some sense can be argued to actually matter more in the way people evaluate you, but that's OK because you chose them. As a side thing: it already happened IRL too. We are currently freaking gorgeous by some historical standards. Nothing has changed. You get used to stuff. They become commonplace. If everyone is very close to the ideal, we'd get used to that, and just notice the smaller differences more. And use tattoos, piercings, jewellery, perfume and clothing to customize our looks. 

You cannot use this as-is for justification for such a conflict. Compare rocket size with the size of a mountain. Now take earth's mountain ridges. Clearly we could lose a mountain, of which many rockets could be made. (Gross oversimplification, but clearly in raw tonnes of material, this is not a problem). But let's say you DO want this as a concept. There's a movie that has in Earth-orbit colony and a kind-of conflict between Earth and the Colony. That movie is Elysium. Basically, people ruined earth, and now the rich live on the colony, whilst the poor slave away on earth. 

Allow me to make some generalizations, so that I may reduce innovative "power" by showing how these groups of people don't have a reason or don't have the means to advance research. 

Possible, yes. If you don't mind altering history a bit. However, beware introducing things that are used publicly. Computers, sure! You can have one in your basement/vault/secret hideout. Automobiles, no. You're going to drive it around and you need space for that. It's much harder to protect. Back in 1950, communication on a global scale was still, well, bad. I can't source this claim, to a quantifiable degree, but there was no internet. There might be global communications for politics, industry and academics, but certainly not for the common people. 

You have, functionally speaking, plumbed the depths of this device. You take it and show it to the greatest minds in the nation: none discovers more about the picture box. Some propose that perhaps placing a lithograph into the tray below the buttons and pressing the correct combination of buttons will make the image of the beach change to that of the lithograph, but nobody makes it work. In playing with this, they discover that messing with this moves a picture of an arrow around the screen, but it appears to do nothing (though tapping it when over the rectangle moves the blinking line). Someone pushes a coin into the coin slot, but it just falls out again and appears to do nothing. Sometimes, it blows a friendly warmth of air at you. Eventually, the image grows dimmer and stops showing up. Someone suggests dismantling it to find how it worked. The lid appears to be a single piece, but the tray appears to be riveted together, so you drill out the rivets. $URL$ Clearly, it's a machine. An electrical machine. You remember it giving off a friendly warm, so the function of the fan is obvious (warming the user). But the rest? Below the fan, probably a heating plate. The big items - probably one stores the electricity, and another stores the image of the beach. The remainder... complex electrical circuits. That's OK, you understand electricity. The wires are glued down to a board, but it's still obvious enough. So many very, very tiny components, but you can quickly identify the simplest ones - the capacitors, resistors, and diodes. You discover that the light in the "caps lock" key operates as a diode, and by providing a voltage to it yourself, slowly increasing, establish that it took about 0.7v to illuminate. You discover that the coin slot was not a coin slot, but rather probably for inserting some complex plug, as were all the other indents around the side. One was clearly for an auxillary power source, with thick tracks leading from it. For the devices you do not understand, you measure the resistance and capacitance, and then plot the V-I curves between each of them. In doing so, you intuit the behavior of the standalone transistors, the power regulator, the clock crystal. Thousands of interested minds join you in your quest to reverse engineer the "seascape device". The effort makes the decoding of the enigma machine look trivial. Entire warehouses quickly fill with written observations. Your understanding of electricity proceeds in leaps and bounds. The science and engineering of electronics becomes a thing, and solid-state devices are developed. Between you, you work out that the board has multiple layers; that clock signals are used to tell the little black boxes to process their inputs; that the boxes have inputs and outputs, and those are made of high voltages and low ones. The other stuff, though... it leaves you baffled. The best you can come up with, for these strange black boxes, is that some of the pins that come out of them are almost certainly for providing power. X-rays and perhaps destructive microscopic examination confirm that the black boxes are protective shells around impossibly-fine wires which connect to small fragments of crystal etched with impossibly fine details. You know that SOME sequence of inputs - high voltages and low voltages - to the various chips, gives some sequence of outputs. It's not always deterministic, but sometimes it is. Assuming you found an entire warehouse of these devices, what more can you find out, even by destroying them? You can map out SOME of the commands of the CPU, once you realize it's not a heating element because there are too many lines going towards it, and figure out it's the heart of the thing. You can identify that it's reading memory, or sending commands to the hard drive controller area. Ultimately, though, your tools and your analytical machines get better and better, and you manage to crack it, to describe the behavior of the thing completely. And you look at each other and say "in creating systems which could analyze this one, we've been forced to develop far better systems ourselves. This is no longer magical or even impressive, it's just a laptop. An outdated one." 

Now, imagine if there was a faulty (by our standards!) theory that had these "magical spirits" that "conduct magic". There are 4 elements to control, and various substances are made of these four elements. Depending on how much of an element it contains, one can control it to a certain degree. Faulty theories ("The sun rotates around the earth") can halt scientific/academic progress for a long time. Add in a world where strange occurrences CAN be explained by magic, and it becomes that much harder to advance technology. Another way to halt scientific progress is if the use of magic strains the mind. If people are constantly mentally tired from doing magic (because by doing magic, a by-product that affects the brain forms in the body), they might not make discoveries as fast. 

This is all a "maybe if" statement, though. Humans are such curious beings. Personally, I think that what you propose can't happen - there'll always be some people who will try to find out the workings of the universe, and magic will just be integrated with that. It might go at a slower progress, however. A slower rate of technological progress is also not too strange. They won't stay stuck at the middle ages, but I could see the middle ages stretching a couple thousand years. 

I would draw a distinction between this and, say, the word of power used in historical golems, or an override code in an android. These are somewhat analogous, but are essentially just commands which grant privilege, included for safety's sake. The PID, like a demon's True Name, is much more than that; it is tied up with the identity of the daemon, and is part of how "being a daemon" works. For a human, everything that defines what it is to be you, your "self", is located in your body (where the seat of the soul or spirit is, whether they even exist, etc is debatable, but that the self is in your body is the general consensus). For a daemon, its essence -- the compiled source code of its being, which governs what it is and what it can do -- is "elsewhere". The "True Name" (or the pid, in the case of the unix daemon) is the addressing scheme which grants a connection to that body, to pass it commands at the level of its creator (the kernel, pid 0 in unix). This is why you don't use the True Name of God. Sending random stuff to pid 0 is never a good idea. [Does this make pid 1 ("init") a daemon, or a prophet? It is the all-parent, the parent of zombies and of ghosts, it is the reaper of children. In the normal nature of things, it is immortal, living as long as pid 0, protected from SIGKILL. But it can be slain, as we can see when the demon takes form in PS-Doom.] 

I'll go for a pessimistic-realistic view: Limit the language families your translator can work at. Here's an example: English, French, Spanish, Danish and 440 other languages are known as the Indo-European language family. They are grouped this way because they use a similar alphabet, similar means of conveying an idea, and share many cognates with each other. When translating in between these languages, you might have to swap a few phrases around, use a different dictionary, but they are otherwise the same. People with a natural tongue in this language are more likely to learn a second language in this category, like Spanish and Dutch. Languages outside this family, however, like many Asian languages, use a different approach. They have a completely different system of letters. Instead of using characters to convey how to pronounce the word, they use it to convey the meaning of the word. Translating between these families would be much tougher than intra-family translation. Therefore, you could make a translator that only works in one family. Decrease the Accuracy of the Translator. Go to Google Translate. Translate "How many pigs does a dog eat?" to Hebrew. Copy the words, and translate it back to English. At the time of this answer (2016-12-06), I got back, "Some pigs do not eat dog?" Translators are known today to be inaccurate. Many foreign exchange students in my high school are known to use Google Translate to convert their native language to English, and I hear the teacher talking to them every other week. Translators aren't perfect, and converting possibly extra-terrestrial languages would be with 100% accuracy is neigh-impossible. Have your device read the conscious of the Translator. This has a few requirements: 

If you place your colonies further away, you could argue that there is a resource (resource X) that allows fast rockets. Resource X is troublesome to excavate, polluting, rare, expensive... you name it. Imagine resource X to be of nuclear origin, but 10x all it's factors and you get something that's pretty nasty. You still need an opponent, though. If me donating you goods costs me a lot, I might just stop. What's preventing me from stopping with sending you goods? Death of a colony? Then why are the people angry? Surely they understand? The idea is workable, but you need another source of conflict. Ecological conflict on a small scale is usually people not wanting to pay for getting rid of their trash properly, so they just dump it. Maybe there's one continent responsible for the colonies and it's polluting the world with the constant rocket launches using Resource X. Background radiation levels are on the rise. Radiation chart: (For better viewing, I recommend the original on XKCD) Basically, the "daily dose" of 10 micro Sv is already increased to 50 micro Sv, and in the future it looks like it will go up to 100 micro Sv and 250 micro Sv. Now, this doesn't seem bad, but the radiation gets in the food, and the water, and slowly the whole world is poisoned. 

This takes place in the optimistic future. While a war general is strategizing his plans of attack, he rejects using outdated war games of the past, and instead tasks a few members of his team to operate on one of the few universe simulators that the government has. While the scientists of the team know how to form the civilization, it requires that a few civilizations in the universe speak the same language, follow these social conventions, etc. etc. How would they direct these civilizations to form the team's desired cultures? Just a few Notes: 

Somebody invented and patented a technology that can read the raw thoughts of a person. Alien and human minds are alike enough for this technology. People are okay with their thoughts being read! 

By reading the raw thoughts of an entity, it removes all borders of language; except when it has to translate those thoughts into a language. While constructed, logical languages designed to convey raw speech like Lojban are available, the receiving party would have to speak this logical language without error for this translator to be 100% accurate. This technology would have other ramifications. If this translator is owned by a company or a government, then the users could complain about how this device could be used to read their minds for their own hidden agenda. What's your choice? I'd say a mix of the first two.. Intra-family translations will be much more accurate than between language families. Otherwise, it should have the capabilities a little better than Google Translate. 

It has been done in 1654 with Magdeburg hemispheres. They're essentially two halves of a metal ball, attached to each other. Then the air is pumped out. They used horses to show that the two halves couldn't be pulled apart afterwards. You won't get a vacuum, but very low pressures, sure. What you'll need is an air pump (bellows) and the two halves of metal. I think it could have been done earlier than 1654, if people realized the ideas earlier. In 1643, Torricelli invented the barometer. This is what lead to the idea of atmospheric pressure (or so I think, you'll want to ask on History.SE to be sure, I'm just researching wikipedia here). With an air valve, I imagine one could easily pump in gases that could react after sucking the normal air out. 

Or more simply put, you need materials to experiment on, tools to experiment with, and scientists to do the actual research and develop the goods. I imagine that any "elite" group of people is very, very, very rich. So a lab and shell companies that buy a truckload of supplies more or less each month are easily set up. But the brainpower, that's a tricky one. Academics is based on peer research. You (for the academics here, I hope I got it right) spend your life working in a field, trying to find out why something works why it does. A lot of time goes into this. You work based on the research of others - others that have researched the things you research before. Academics is a culture based on sharing. This contradicts the culture where an elite group secretly has superior tech. Communication enables sharing. Thus, for this to be viable, you'll have to take away communication. This could work in 1950, but in modern times, I don't think it's viable anymore. Nearly everybody in developed countries carries a camera and a global communication device.
