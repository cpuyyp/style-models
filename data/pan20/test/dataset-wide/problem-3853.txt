This is a comment which won't fit in the comment box. Let me see if I understand the question. There are three equalities: $$\dim \ H^0(X, L_{\lambda}) = \int_X e^{\lambda+\rho} \prod \frac{\alpha}{e^{\alpha/2} - e^{-\alpha/2}} \quad (1)$$ $$\int_X e^{\lambda+\rho} \prod \frac{\alpha}{e^{\alpha/2} - e^{-\alpha/2}} = \left. \left( \sum_{w \in W} e^{w(\lambda+\rho)} {\LARGE /} \prod(e^{\alpha/2} - e^{- \alpha/2}) \right)\right|_{0} \quad (2)$$ $$ \left. \left( \sum_{w \in W} e^{w(\lambda+\rho)} {\LARGE /} \prod(e^{\alpha/2} - e^{- \alpha/2}) \right)\right|_{0} = \prod \frac{\langle \lambda+\rho, \alpha \rangle}{\langle \rho, \alpha \rangle} \quad (3)$$ Here $|_{0}$ means that the formula, being a power series in the weights of $T$, is a function on the Cartan algebra $\mathfrak{h}$, and we are to evaluate this function at the origin. Is your question how to go from the LHS of $(2)$ to the RHS of $(3)$ without passing through the RHS of $(2)$? 

Let $\phi : \mathbb{Z}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function such that (1) $\phi$ can be written as a rational combination of the characteristic functions of finitely many rational cones and (2) there is a linear function $\lambda$ so that $\phi$ vanishes on $\{ e : \lambda(e) \leq 0 \} \setminus \{ 0 \}$. We define $$h(\phi) = \sum \phi(e) z^e.$$ This sum converges somewhere, and gives a rational function of $z$. Given $\phi$ as above, and given a generic linear functional $\zeta$, one can show that there is a unique function $\phi^{\zeta}$ such that (1) $\phi$ can be written as a rational combination of the characteristic functions of finitely many cones (2) $\phi$ vanishes on $\{ e : \zeta(e) \leq 0 \} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and (3) $h(\phi^{\zeta}) = h(\phi)$. For example, the above computation shows that $\phi^{(-1)} = \psi$. If $\phi$ is the characteristic function of a simplicial cone, this operation is easy to describe. In principle, this means we can always calculate $\phi^{\zeta}$ by writing $\phi$ as a linear combination of simplicial cones. If $\phi$ is the characteristic function of a cone, what is known about $\phi^{\zeta}$? For example, is it true that (a) all the values of $\phi^{\zeta}$ have the same sign (NO, counter-example below), or that (b) $\phi^{\zeta}$ only takes the values $-1$, $0$ and $1$? 

In principal, one should be able to carry out this computation carefully enough to get the constant, but I'm not going to do it. Conceptually, this computation is similar to the classical computation that the map sending $(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_r)$ to the coefficients of the polynomial $\prod (z-\alpha_i)$ has Jacobian $\prod_{i<j} (\alpha_i - \alpha_j)$. However, because of the constraint that the eigenvalues have product $1$, the details don't quite match. 

Other people have already answered the mathematical question. I'll point out a possible source of linguistic confusion: the word "eigen", in eigenvector and eigenbasis, is German for something like "own" or "self". I would guess that the poster may have been translating "eigen" into English rather than leaving it alone. 

The phrase in square brackets is my own but is implied by context; clearly, the existence of $(33,34,45)$ shows that $\mu$ does not alternate on every connected block of square free numbers. 

It is worth mentioning the "Newton above Hodge" theorem. This is a way in which the point count can impose nontrivial conditions on the Hodge numbers, beyond knowing the Betti numbers. As I assume you know, the number of points of $X(\mathbb{F}_{q^k})$ is $\sum_{r=0}^{2n} (-1)^r \sum_{i=1}^{b_r} \alpha_{i,r}^{k}$ where $b_i$ is the $i$-th betti number and $\alpha$'s are algebraic integers obeying $|\alpha_{i,r}| = q^{r/2}$, where the left hand side is any archimedean absolute value. Also, we can number the $\alpha$'s such that $\alpha_{i,r} \alpha_{b_r+1-i, r} = q^r$. (This is a consequence of Hard Lefschetz.). In particular, $\prod_i \alpha_{i,r} = \pm q^{r b_r/2}$. Fix $r$, so it will no longer appear in our notation. Let $F(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{b_r} (x-\alpha_{i,r})$; this is the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius on $H^r(X)$. Let $N$ be the $p$-adic Newton polytope of $F$. Since the constant term of $F$ is $\pm q^{r b_r/2}$, the endpoints of the Newton polytope are at $(0,0)$ and $(b_r, r b_r/2 \cdot v_p(q))$. The symmetry $\alpha_{i,r} \alpha_{b_r+1-i, r} = q^r$ means that the segments of slope $\mu$ and $r-\mu$ have the same length. In ulrich's example, all of the eigenvalues of Frob on $H^2$ have norm $q$, so $N$ is just a straight line from $(0,0)$ to $(22,22)$. We now define the Hodge polygon $H$. This is also a piecewise linear convex curve joining $(0,0)$ to $(b_r, r b_r v_p(q)/2)$. All of the segments have slope of the form $k r v_p(q)/2$ for some integer $k$ between $0$ and $2r$, and the horizontal length of this segment is $h^{k,r-k}$. The symmetry of the Hodge diamond tells us that this polygon, also, has the property that the segments of slope $\mu$ and $r-\mu$ have the same length. In Ulrich's example $X$, the Hodge polygon goes from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, then to $(21,20)$, and then to $(22,22)$. 

$\def\QQ{\mathbb{Q}}$This question seems unmotivated to me, but I might as well answer it: Yes, for any finite extension $K \supset \QQ$, there is some $\alpha \in K$ such that $\QQ(\alpha^n) = K$ for all nonzero integers $n$. $\def\p{\mathfrak{p}}$Let $p$ be a prime which splits completely in $K$, say $p = \p_1 \p_2 \ldots \p_d$ with $d=[K:\QQ]$. We know that $p$ exists by Cebotarov. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there is some $\alpha$ such that the $d$ valuations $v_{\p_i}(\alpha)$ are all distinct. So, for any $n$, the $d$ valuations $v_{\p_i}(\alpha^n)$ are all distinct. If $L$ is a proper subfield of $K$, then there is some pair $\p_i$ and $\p_j$ such that $\p_i \cap L = \p_j \cap L$. (Because $p$ can only break into at most $[L:\QQ]$ factors in $L$.) So, if $\alpha^n$ were in $L$, then $v_{\p_i}(\alpha^n)$ would equal $v_{\p_j}(\alpha^n)$. This contradiction shows that $\alpha^n$ is not contained in any subfield of $K$. Remark: One can make the same argument work using the archimedean place, if it happens that $K$ is totally real. This is what is happening in the case of $\QQ(\sqrt{2})$. 

Yes. Set $K = \mathrm{Frac} \ R$. Lemma: Let $\ldots \to C_2 \to C_1 \to C_0$ be a complex of $R$-modules. Suppose that $C^{\bullet} \otimes_R K$ is exact (but not necessarily surjective at $C_0$). Then $H_k(C_{\bullet})$ is $R$-torsion for $k>0$. Proof: Let $v \in C_k$ with $dv=0$. So $d(v \otimes 1)=0$. By the exactness of $C^{\bullet} \otimes_R K$, there is $u \in C_{k+1} \otimes_R K$ with $du=v$. Write $u=\sum w_i \otimes (f_i/g_i)$, with $f_i/g_i \in K$ and $w_i \in C_{k+1}$. Set $g=\prod g_i$ and $w=\sum \left( \prod_{j \neq i} g_j \right) f_i w_i$. Then $dw=gv$, so $[v]$ is $g$-torsion in $H_k(C_{\bullet})$. QED Take resolutions $A_{\bullet} \to M$ and $B_{\bullet} \to N$ by free $R$-modules. Then $\mathrm{Tor}_{\bullet}(M,N)$ is the homology of the complex formed by collappsing the double complex $A_{\bullet} \otimes_R B_{\bullet}$. Note that $\left( A_{\bullet} \otimes_R B_{\bullet} \right) \otimes_R K \cong (A_{\bullet} \otimes_R K) \otimes_K (B_{\bullet} \otimes_R K)$. Since $A^{\bullet}$ is exact, so is $A^{\bullet} \otimes_R K$. Thus $A_{\bullet} \otimes_R K$ breaks up as a direct sum of complexes of the form $\ldots \ldots 0 \to K \to K \to 0 \ldots$, and the complex $\ldots \to 0 \to K$, with the $K$ in the last position. (This uses the Axiom of Choice; I suspect you should be able to avoid it, but I don't see how right now.) The complex $B \otimes_R K$ breaks up into pieces of the same kind. So the double complex breaks up into squares $\begin{smallmatrix} K & \to & K \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ K & \to & K \end{smallmatrix}$, vertical strips $\begin{smallmatrix} K \\ \downarrow \\ K \end{smallmatrix}$, horizontal strips $\begin{smallmatrix} K & \to & K \end{smallmatrix}$ and, in position $(0,0)$, some isolated copies of $K$. Only summands of the last type contribute to the cohomology of the double complex, so the double complex obeys the hypotheses of the lemma and we are done. 

Recall that to put a regular CW complex on space $X$ means to decompose $X$ into disjoint pieces $Y_i$ such that: (1) The closure of each $Y_i$ is a union of $Y$'s. (2) For each $i$, the pair $(\overline{Y_i}. Y_i)$ is homemorphic to $(\mbox{closed}\ d-\mbox{ball}, \mbox{interior of that}\ d-\mbox{ball})$ for some $d$. The barycentric subdivision of $X$ corresponding to this regular CW complex is the simplicial complex which has a vertex for each $Y_i$ and has a simplex $(i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_r)$ if and only if $\overline{Y_{i_0}} \subset \overline{Y_{i_1}} \subset \cdots \subset \overline{Y_{i_r}}$.
