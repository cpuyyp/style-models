Controls The first control seems to be an attendance, vacation and leave policy (the way you worded it, at least, makes me think there either isn't one, or it's not enforced). Employees should know that they're held to a standard of attendance, but they should also know that there's a limit to the number of call-outs, vacation/sick days and bereavement days, that must also in part be substantiated. A sample bereavement policy. Please note that key points in the linked sample are that supervision must approve time off, and exceptions exist for staffing requirements. You should work closely with the owner and potentially an HR consultant on such policies and implement them as going forward, without penalizing any current or past action. But let's visit staffing requirements for a moment. Now there have to be some company or organizational goals in place. For a private company it's less obvious, but for any publicly traded company the failure to meet critical path goals is plainly visible to shareholders, and can negatively impact the company in many ways. As personal or departmental goals need to coincide with the timely completion of organization goals, typically projects have deadlines and a reporting structure. Tying back into attendance and leave, it needs to be clear that everyone is responsible for meeting your organizational goals regardless of their personal assignment. This means pulling people from other tasks when a deadline is in danger of not being met. Employees will very quickly get sick of having to work harder because certain people keep taking time off, when you pull them to work on Project B and they're responsible for Project A's deadline. I'd also implement a regular report or dashboard so that tasks which tie into a deadline are monitored. This not only makes what needs to be done transparent via feedback, but creates accountability for what isn't getting done. If your company issues an annual bonus, let them know missing deadlines hurts that, and their bonuses depend on the percent of goals met. That's a number that they can directly impact. Make sure the owner is on board here. My biggest stress here is don't go crazy pushing a management style because that's more about people and politics many times. Rather, I think it's worthwhile to control the environment. 

This is where it gets tricky. They hopefully had you officially agree to a cut and done salary reduction to accommodate these furlough days, and this is legally permissible and wont lose you your exempt status. This also strengthens the argument that you didn't simply take a hit for the furlough days, you simply agreed to cut your own salary in expectation of business downturn. Basically there is a quid-pro-quo in having these days off but only if you'd remained working for the company. You'd need to speak to a specialist in wage law to determine if you're entitled to back pay at this point, but you should ask the company about whether they can give you back pay since you're leaving first. It'll also depend on what you agreed to in writing. 

I graduated with no domain experience, though I held a steady 40hr/wk job through college. I applied those skills that I acquired working elsewhere to an entry-level part-time technician job in my field, where I worked 20hrs there and 20hrs part-time at an unrelated job. I transitioned into a full-time position in a role that I wanted after about 6 months by demonstrating to the employer that was where I wanted my future effort going. I accomplished that by going above what they wanted out of the technician role and edging into the domain role where possible. This was also beneficial because I understood more than one role and could wear more than one hat if I needed to. My total time from graduation to full-time domain role was 9 months. Note that it takes a lot of work and a lot of thought, and that the role may open up for you faster, it may open up for you slower. I do, however, believe it entirely possible to make ends meet by coming in a bit lower than you think you should. A general problem I identified is that you graduate, and you immediately see dollar signs and conduct your job search accordingly. This can be a bit unrealistic, and you'll feel it during the job interviews. Since I don't know your situation I can't comment further, though. Make note that for some fields, such as clinical/medical, this is vastly harder due to licensing/certification/training requirements. 

Companies tend to frown upon internal relationships due to a concept called conflict of interest. This is especially bad if you're directly dating someone in a manager-subordinate fashion because consider: You're the manager, and your subordinate that you're dating gets in trouble. How likely are you to lessen the severity of the punishment based on your relationship? Likewise, one could assume that you're dating the manager's brother. You interact more personally with the manager and thus when it comes down to discipline, or suggestions, improvements, etc. Imagine anything where that sort of bias, or propensity to side with you is a direct product of the relationship w/ your manager's brother. The reverse is also true, if you two fall out somehow, be careful! This is generally regardless of circumstance. The assumption is that despite your best intentions the bias still exists in some way, shape or form. I can name a few big financial firms that don't even allow relationships b/t peers, they tend to disappear at a much faster rate than non-dating coworkers. IMO, however, this is very much a situation that you and the company will have to settle internally, because from my standpoint this is an industry culture issue (not just your company's culture). It would have been best that no one ever found out about this relationship. 

This is not acceptable, and then: 2) You were dropped by the company for the issue stated above, meaning you probably dodged a bullet. I would feel relieved to have gotten out of that pipeline ASAP, so I could conduct my job search elsewhere. 

Many companies are receptive to "you hired me to do junior work, paid me to do junior work, and had me doing upper-level work, can i get a raise?" It's pretty much the basis of receiving a raise or promotion. There's upside as well: you can list upper-level experience on your resume instead of junior, and go find another job for a potentially substantial increase in wages. The downside is that even if they own up to their mistake, your raise may be inherently capped due to company policy at 3, 5 or 10%. You might exceed these figures by simply applying at a different company. The fact you're already working there hurts the ceiling on anything you attempt to negotiate. 

Cut your losses and find somewhere else unless you really, for some reason, want to work with that company. If there are wages you feel entitled to recoup, consult a lawyer. Since we still don't know which country, we also don't know if the change in wage was legal, either. In the US it would be tricky. IANAL first and foremost. Wage law states that you must be paid the agreed upon rate for work already done. In other words, if you do work thinking you're making $15/hr and your paycheck comes and surprise! They actually paid you $8/hr, then the company is not operating within its rights. On the other hand, if your boss sat down and said henceforth you make $8/hr, you have two options: continue to do work for that rate or quit. Continuing to work for that rate implies you agree to the new pay and you can't expect to recoup any money. The former may be reason to file a department of labor complaint, but first you could try to resolve internally, especially if you haven't flagged the change as a potential mistake with management or HR. Take control of your money! 

Regularly, if you're being laid off, for example, because your company no longer has funding for your position, you're entitled to claim unemployment benefits from the state. Voluntary resignation and firing for cause make the company (mostly) exempt from having to pay money for these unemployment benefits, and so they cut funding by laying you off, and then save even more by listing you as having resigned. Thomas Owens suggests and perhaps rightly so that you may not want to burn a good reference. You would draft a resignation letter, sign it and give it to your company. Our hope is that they give you enough time to line up another opportunity before you're let go. In cases where you need income and the company is putting undue financial burden on you, you have the option to fight this and apply for unemployment anyways, even if the company's documents say "resigned." They will object and you will have a chance to present your case in arbitration. Again, maintaining good terms with that employer you wouldn't probably do this, but it's still a sketchy practice to inaccurately qualify someone's termination for them. All they're doing is putting your claim to unemployment benefits at risk. 

In the US, regardless of where you previously worked (though it does make a difference to a point), a hiring company will probably look for 3 basic things: Authorization to work in the U.S., relevant/desirable/demonstrable experience commensurate with what the job requires, and the interview process. Number one goes without saying but some people do mess up here, and it affects your job prospects so you got to make sure work authorization is taken care of. Coming out of that, you need to know what you're doing. If the resume doesn't add up, you're out. If you get into a technical interview and fail there, you're out. And this isn't meant to be scary, but a big take-home point is that where you got the experience doesn't matter so much as being able to demonstrate your proficiency to: (1) do the job, and (2) function in the US work culture. A degree, like a bachelor's can sometimes speak for itself, and problematically, for some countries all degrees aren't viewed to be created equally. This is why you must have your international degree reviewed and approved by an auditing agency for transfer into U.S. universities. I can't comment here, however, because I'm not too certain myself how each case will translate. 

Industries have started to agree that the internship is the new entry-level job, the one you use to get in on the 1-3yrs experience jobs. Entry-level means no reasonable expectation of experience, it's your first job in the domain. They're going to expect, IMO, that you're the person that fits this bill. Everything held equal, of course having sound technical knowledge gives you an edge if there are many other candidates, as does having a good-fit personality, schedule, etc. etc. etc. That being said, no one is going to penalize you for being eager, for having questions, and for being forward-thinking. If I'd gotten the same email from an industry senior, of course he should already know what to expect from interviews period. But for an internship, the expectation may very well be: this person has never even held a job! Don't sweat the small stuff, you're interviewing for this internship to learn the do's and dont's, and you don't learn if you don't try! 

Some of the answers here are very direct in their approach. Take the fight to him. Even taking the fight higher, to HR for example, I think is impossible for a wide proportion of personality types. Typically for those familiar with the Myers & Briggs personality types, anyone who scores as an introvert. The types in themselves aren't there to categorize people as those who can or can't do, rather, how that person handles situations and how we can expect to have them handle situations will be different. The sort of strategy below is for someone like me, typically quiet, reserved and averse to conflict. There are a couple of gaps in the question here, namely, how does the perceived bullying affect your work? Are others bullied by the same individual? Does his department share any sentiment? And finally what have you done, in anything? Try to understand the motivation: bullying is never about the victim, rather, about the bully and their disposition. Maybe your salary is much higher and he's been there longer and he resents you. It's completely unprofessional, but it happens painfully often. Cues aren't always that obvious, though. You can try to relocate yourself: let your boss know that you're distracted at your current desk and a different desk, preferably away from your bully, would be beneficial. I wouldnt name drop your colleague because I can't at this point substantiate whether he's actually deliberately bullying you. Not to play down your situation but bullying victimization and bullying perpetration are two different things that may not be occurring concomitantly. And of course step 3 is to take things into your own hands. It's important not to attack the other person. You want to ideally keep your ego in check and be specific: it's exactly this that you say to me that bothers me deeply. These are things you can try to do for yourself before the situation has to escalate. You should not, however, be afraid to reach out to people who can make real changes. You just don't want to drop a bomb on a country that was never invading in the first place. Disclaimer: This is based on current research into adult bullying and I have never myself been bullied in the workplace. 

TL;DR companies can make speculative statements and not follow through on them at all, and in presentation materials and call transcripts you can always find the disclaimer for forward-looking statements that makes this okay. The executive committee should not under any circumstance make non-speculative promises that could lead to a breach of fiduciary duty or insider trading suit, however. That's beyond scope here, but essentially one or more parties sue the company and potentially executives if they were involved. Employees are typically not involved unless otherwise noted, and shouldn't get involved unless otherwise required. Also, employees absolutely should not disclose non-public information to investors. This opens up multiple parties to insider trading. "We are developing Java" was made public, for example, during an investor call. "We aren't going to develop Java" was not made public, is known only internally, and should not be disclosed.
