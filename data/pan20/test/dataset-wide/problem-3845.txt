In this book Kollar and Mori define big divisors only for proper (irreducible) varieties, so when they say that for a birational morphism $f:X\to Y$, the pullback $f^*D$ of a divisor $D$ on $Y$ is big if and only if $D$ is big, they probably mean $X$ and $Y$ are proper. To see that $D$ is big if and only if $f^*D$ is, you can use Lemma 2.60. This says in particular that a Cartier divisor $E$ on a variety $Z$ is big if, and only if, the rational map $\phi_{kE}$ defined by some multiple of it has image of dimension equal to $\dim Z$. The point is that $X$ and $Y$ have isomorphic dense open subsets and the maps $\phi_{kD}$ and $\phi_{kf^*D}$ coincide on them. 

Here is a lighthearted attempt at generalizing the discussion of Hurwitz' formula in Hartshorne to higher dimensions. Let $f:Y\to X$ be morphism of schemes over a field $k$. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are integral and smooth of dimension $n$, and that $f$ is finite, dominant and separable. Consider the exact sequence \begin{equation*} f^* \Omega_X \to \Omega_Y \to \Omega_{Y/X} \to 0. \end{equation*} Separability of the extension of fields $k(X)\subseteq k(Y)$ is equivalent to the vanishing $\Omega_{k(Y)/k(X)}=0$. Thus the map $f^*\Omega_X\to \Omega_Y$ is surjective at the generic point of $Y$. It follows that it is also injective there, since the two sheaves involved are locally free of the same rank. We conclude that $f^*\Omega_X\to \Omega_Y$ is injective everywhere, since $Y$ is integral. Exterior powers of injective maps of modules that are finite and free over a ring are again injective. Thus the natural map $f^*\omega_X\to \omega_Y$ is injective. Tensoring with $\omega_Y^{-1}$, we obtain an invertible ideal sheaf $f^*\omega_Y\otimes \omega_Y^{-1} \subseteq \mathscr O_Y$. The corresponding effective Cartier divisor $R$ is called the ramification divisor of the cover $f:Y\to X$. By construction there is a natural isomorphism $f^*\omega_X(R)\xrightarrow\sim \omega_Y$. Let $P\in Y$ be a point of codimension 1. We next show that \begin{equation*} \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}}\mathscr O_{R,P} = \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P. \end{equation*} (I apologise in advance for the inelegant proof.) This will imply the Weil divisor associated with $R$ is \begin{equation*} \sum_{F\subseteq Y} (\operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,F}} \Omega_{Y/X}) \cdot F, \end{equation*} where the sum runs over all prime divisors of $Y$. In particular, the complement of $R$ in $Y$ is the largest open subset restricted to which $f$ is unramified. Denote $A:=\mathscr O_{Y,P}$ and let $t\in A$ be a uniformizer. Choose bases around $P$ for the rank-$n$ locally free sheaves $f^*\Omega_Y$ and $\Omega_Y$. The map $(f^*\Omega_Y)_P\to (\Omega_X)_P$ is then given by a matrix $\alpha$, which we may assume to be in Smith normal form: \begin{equation*} \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} t^{a_1} & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & t^{a_n} \end{bmatrix}, \end{equation*} where the $a_i\ge 0$ are integers. Here there are no zeroes along the diagonal because $\alpha$ tensored with $\operatorname{Frac}(A)$ must be surjective. It easy to see that \begin{equation*} \mathscr O_{R,P} \cong A/(\det \alpha) = A/(t^{\sum a_i}), \end{equation*} while \begin{equation*} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P\cong \oplus_{i\ge 0}^n A/(t^{a_i}), \end{equation*} so these two modules have the same length $\sum a_i$. Let $r(P)$ be the ramification of $f$ at $P$: this is the valuation of the image of any uniformizer of $\mathscr O_{X,f(P)}$ in $\mathscr O_{Y,P}$. Assume that the characteristic of $k$ does not divide $r(P)$, that the finite field extension $k(f(P))\subseteq k(P)$ is separable, and that the finitely generated one $k\subseteq k(f(P))$ is separably generated. We show that under these circumstances \begin{equation*} \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P = r(P)-1. \end{equation*} Denote \begin{align*} r &:= r(P), \\ A &:= \mathscr O_{X,f(P)}, \\ B &:= \mathscr O_{Y,P}. \end{align*} Thus we have inclusions $k\subseteq B\subseteq A$. Denote the maximal ideal of $A$ by ${\frak m}_A$, its residue field by $k_A$, and similarly for $B$. Thus ${\frak m}_A = (t_A)$ and ${\frak m}_B = (t_B)$ with $t_B = u t_A^r$, where $u\in A^\times$ is a unit. By hypothesis there is a transcendence basis $\bar f_1,\dotsc, \bar f_{n-1}$ of $k_B$ over $k$ such that the extension $k_B/k(\bar f_1,\dotsc,\bar f_{n-1})$ is separable (hence has no relative differentials). Choose lifts $f_1,\dotsc, f_{n-1}\in B$ of the elements of this transcendence basis. Looking at the exact sequence \begin{equation*} {\frak m}_B/{\frak m}_B^2 \xrightarrow{d} \Omega_B \otimes k_B \to \Omega_{k_B} \to 0 \end{equation*} and applying Nakayama we see that the map $B^{\oplus n} \to \Omega_B$ that sends \begin{equation*} e_i \mapsto \begin{cases} df_i & \text{if }i\le n-1\\ dt_B & \text{if }i = n \end{cases} \end{equation*} is surjective. Let $K$ denote its kernel. Then $\operatorname{Tor}_1^B(\Omega_B,k_B)$ surjects onto $K\otimes_B k_B$. From the fact that $\Omega_B$ is free, it follows that $K=0$. Thus the free $B$-module $\Omega_B$ has $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_B$ as a basis. From the fact that $k_A/k_B$ is separable, it follows that $k_A/k(\bar f_1,\dotsc, \bar f_{n-1})$ is as well, so by the preceding argument the free $A$-module $\Omega_A$ has $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_A$ as a basis. The relative differentials $\Omega_{A/B}$ are thus the quotient of $\Omega_A$ by the submodule generated by $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_B$. Denote by $M$ the itermediate quotient of $\Omega_A$ by $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}$. Then $M$ is freely generated by the image of $dt_A$. Write \begin{equation*} dt_B = t_A^r du + u r t_A^{r-1} dt_A \end{equation*} in $\Omega_A$. In $M$ we have $du = f dt_A$ for some $f\in A$, so $dt_B = u' t_A^{r-1}dt_A$, for some $u'\in A$. From the fact that $r\ne 0$ in $k$, it follows that $u'$ is a unit. Hence the map \begin{equation*} A/(t_A^{r-1}) \xrightarrow{\cdot dt_A} \Omega_{A/B} \end{equation*} is an isomorphism and $\operatorname{length}_A \Omega_{A/B} = r-1$ as claimed. 

Here's another answer that may be more satisfying: Use convexity. Short summary: length of weighted simple closed multi-curves defines a convex function on the space of measured foliations with respect to any system of natural coordinates. A convex function defined at rational points automatically has a unique continuous extension to real values of the parameters, which in this case is all measured foliations. I'm happy to give more details, but I'd like some confirmation that someone is reading this first... 

Take a contraction of $x$ in $A$. That gives an $n$-chain $y_A$ living in $A$, whose boundary is $x$. Similarly, a contraction of $x$ in $B$ gives an $n$-chain $y_B$, again with boundary equal to $x$. The desired preimage is $y_A - y_B$. 

This isn't directly what you ask, but it's also worth noting that unknot detection is in $\text{NP} \cap \text{co-NP}$, that is, there are polynomial-checkable certificates that will show that either a knot is the unknot or that the knot is not the unknot. The $\text{NP}$ certificate uses normal surface theory: 

There's a more geometrically natural description of a $\mathbb{Z}$-central extension in both cases. For $\operatorname{Diff}(S^1)$, the central extension are diffeomorphisms $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which are equivariantly periodic, i.e. $f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$. For $\mathcal{A}$, the central extension consists of holomorphic structures on the strip $I \times \mathbb{R}$ (where $I$ is an interval) which are invariant under translation by $1$ in the $\mathbb{R}$ direction, together with an equivariant parametrization of both boundaries by $\mathbb{R}$. These are considered up to equivariant isomorphism. (If the interval $I$ has length $> 0$, then you can assume the parametrization is by the identity map by shearing your holomorphic structures. But this way makes the compatibility with $\widetilde{\operatorname{Diff}}(S^1)$ more obvious.) In both cases the composition is clear, and it's also obvious that $\widetilde{\operatorname{Diff}}(S^1)$ acts on $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}$. Presumably these two extensions embed in the $\mathbb{R}$-central extension you describe. 

Jeff Brock proved that the hyperbolic volume of the mapping torus is approximated by the translation distance of $\phi$ in the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmüller space. The Weil-Petersson and Teichmüller geodesics are quasi-isometric outside the thin part; inside the thin part, the Weil-Petersson metric puts the singularity at a finite distance. It's reasonable to guess that $l$ would track the geodesic corresponding to $\phi$ in the Weil-Petersson metric, but I'm not sure whether that's been proved or not. 

$\widetilde{\textit{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})}$ is not so complicated, but one of the best descriptions is just that. It has no faithful finite-dimensional representations, which makes things a little tricky. It's easy to see that $\textit{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ is topologically a solid torus, so it does have a central extension by $\mathbb{Z}$. Another description of this central extension is to think of $PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ acting on the hyperbolic plane. Then $\widetilde{SL_2(\mathbb{R})}$ is pairs $(g,\phi)$ where $g \in PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a map that induces the map from $S^1$ to $S^1$ induced by $g$ on the circle at infinity. (Note that this goes by a quotient from $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and then centrally extends back again.) For the relation to $B_3$, you can think of $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ as the mapping class group of the 4-times punctured sphere, with one puncture (at infinity) distinguished and required to go to itself. To go from there to its central extension $B_3$, you remove a disk (rather than a point) around infinity, and only look at isotopies that fix that boundary, which is similar to what happened at the circle at infinity above. More generally, all mapping class groups have a unique central extension; if there's a distinguished point, you can do it in the braid-like way (looking at isotopies that fix a boundary circle), while if there isn't, you do it by lifting the map of the surface to a map from $\mathbb{H}^2$ to itself (not an isometry) and then lifting the action on the circle at infinity to a map from $\mathbb{R}$ to itself. (These are equivalent when they are both defined.) (I still feel like it ought to be possible to make the connection crisper.) 

My question is: is the game NEXPTIME-complete? In order to put it into the framework of a formal game, we should think of it as a game with two sides: all the players (collectively), and Nature, who shuffled the deck and deals out the cards when players draw new cards. This then fits it into the context of a team game with hidden information, in the language of Hearn and Demaine's book Games, Puzzles, and Computation. More precisely, in their language, it is a bounded team game with hidden information. According to the handy chart in their book, a "generic" such game is expected to be NEXPTIME-complete: $$ \begin{array}{rcccc} & \mathrm{0\ player} & \mathrm{1\ player} & \mathrm{2\ player} & \mathrm{Team} \\ \mathrm{Bounded} & \mathrm{P} & \mathrm{NP} & \mathrm{PSPACE} & \mathrm{NEXPTIME} \\ \mathrm{Unbounded} & \mathrm{PSPACE} & \mathrm{PSPACE} & \mathrm{EXPTIME} & \mathrm{RE\ (undecidable)} \end{array} $$ For everything that isn't in the "Team" column, many examples of real games of the given complexity class are known. But as far as I know, no games of the "generic" complexity class are know in the team case. Hanabi strikes me as a good candidate, as it has (a) a fairly simple rule set but (b) in practice, requires quite complicated deductions about other player's states of knowledge. Of course, to make this a precise question, the game needs to be suitably generalized, increasing the number of colors and/or cards of a given color. A precise problem also has to be given: probably the problem of "given this initial play state, common knowledge to all players, do the players have a strategy that guarantees a win?" One complication is going to be that the optimal strategy will almost certainly be quite artificial, of the form of giving a clue that is a hash function of all the cards that you can see. Maybe there's some way to vary the rules to forbid such conventions. (Perhaps just restricting to the two player case.) Has anyone thought about this problem?
