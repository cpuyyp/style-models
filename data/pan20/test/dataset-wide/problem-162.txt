While most answers so far have chosen to say "yes" (to some degree or another), I'll try to present a case for "no" (with a caveat). Real world history is inherently complicated. It isn't even fully known. We can only attempt to make a best reconstruction, with a lot of effort. The concept of "History" in most people's mind is not such a best reconstruction, but a biased and simplified view of the world: this includes "most authors". Such a biased and simplified view can often come with misconceptions taken as "foregone conclusions". Thus, there is a real risk of making the author lazy in the worldbuilding process, wherein they simply transfer their biases and simplifications of history onto the fictional/alternate world, and miss out on the opportunity to imagine details within the interactions of the world that could have lead to unique story opportunities. In my opinion, the the sort of detail that is examined when building a new good fictional world is similar to the sort of detail real life archaelogists and historians have to deal with when interpreting extant records. Nothing is "black or white", nothing is a simple stereotype. A good example of a series that makes this mistake is the The Shadow Campaign series. It is not alternate reality, but it is heavily based on real world "history", with a good dose of the author's unintentional biases. Poor world building. So, unless you are willing to put in historian level effort into first studying history until the point where your alternate reality diverges, you may be unintentionally hobbling yourself by inherent/assumed biases. 

You will kill everything on the planet and render it uninhabitable. I can't think of a way to preserve atmosphere, the cold of space will freeze everything, and moving the planet in a "reasonable amount of time" will require so many G's that it will flatten everyone and everything. Therefore, you must terraform every planet you move (if habitability is your intent). A "reasonable amount of time" will be measured in centuries unless you want to start ripping chunks of material off the planet. Sometimes, science sucks. Your ships must be remotely piloted. The gravity involved on the ship will kill microbes. The size of the "gravity sink" can be a golfball using the right material (something like Neutron star mass). The planet will become tidally locked to the tug. Restarting the rotation will require multiple tugs spining around the planet to get it up to speed. This process will affect whatever solar system you move the mass into. It will affect it tremendously, and I'm not at all sure the tugs can enter and leave the system in a way that will leave the system balanced. You'd almost need to "throw" the moved planet into position, leaving the tugs a long way away from the system. This would make getting the rotation right a neat trick, and would likely require millenia for the system to completely balance. Inertia isn't free. The gravity sink will attract the planet in the same way a magnet will attract metal, but you still need the 1027+ Newton energy supply to move said planet. Remember Newton's 2nd & 3rd laws. The energy needed to do this is unfathomable. 

The Background: I am going to be asking a series of questions that will be relevant to forming some sort of a picture of human space commerce. Let's say that Earth-based human civilizations have discovered a series of ancient jump-gates that allow them to travel within a large and varied interstellar network. There are not many clues, apart from the jumpgates, as to who left this system behind. For the moment, I am assuming that there is no bias to the kind of systems included in the network: i.e. its not like systems with earth like planets make up the majority of the planets in the network. So, "system types" have roughly the same probability of occurrence as if one were just taking a cross-section of space and scanning it. Put another way, the gates simply connect a large number of close-by star systems, rather than a large number of only useful star systems. While genetically-engineered humans exist in this "universe", no sentient non-human aliens have yet been encountered. The Question: If a space faring civilization can build space stations, why would they ever bother with planets? For resources, space stations could be built around asteroid belts. Otherwise, space stations may be placed in almost any orbit or other stable configuration. So, what might planets offer, that stations simply cannot? If terraforming technology exists, assume that it is time consuming (centuries). 

Hero of Alexandria illustrated examples of cranes using early block and tackle systems, so the concept and technology certainly existed. The real problem is the connection point at the tips of the limbs. The pulley system makes it easier to draw, but it doesn't reduce the actual force in the limbs at all. Therefore, the force on the tips of the limbs is... impressive. You could simply bolt a chunk of metal on the tips, but that means you lose all the flexibility of the tips and that's no small thing. You could gain some of it back by making longer limbs, but one of the bonuses for crossbows is their compact design. However, you need to remember that compound bows are NOT stronger. The pulleys make them easier to draw, nothing more. Crossbow solved that problem with levers and cranks which often had the advantage of automatically notching the string. It's altogether likely that adding pulleys to the mix wouldn't add substantially to the drawing process and the technical drawbacks, in my opinion, make this a net negative. Answer:â€ƒYes, they could do it. No, it's likely not valuable.
