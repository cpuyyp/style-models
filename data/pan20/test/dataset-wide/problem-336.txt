You could have underwater trains. Think hyperloop and such. Since your world is covered in water you cna have underwater dome stations and maybe cities as well that juts out to the ocean surface. Makes for an interesting social hierarchy as well but that's outside of your question so yeah maybe toy around with the idea for underwater trains. 

They could manufacture agricultural items such as plows and digging tools. It does not need fuel to work which they need. They can do repairs as well. Basically fulfilling the roles of blacksmiths. This of course depends on the overall technological capabilities of the surrounding communities that trade with them. They can also do assembly of machinery given the specs are available or in the overseer's memory/database. Additionally they can trade information in manufacturing and calculations as well such as how deep to dig a well given certain parameters etc. This could prove more valuable than tools. 

I think Thorne is right. How about Greek and Norse or even Celtic? These have been portrayed in a lot of sci-fi and fantasy stories already. If you still would want to use any of the religions you mentioned, you may want to consult subject matter experts i.e, priest, rabbi, imams etc. so that you can determine facts, what you can write about and be more accurate about it. 

Just to throw this in there, maybe when you activate the magic, it creates tendrils of magic energy or use existing materials like vines (think druidic or necromantic magic) to support and make the bones move like a puppet on strings. 

Maybe asteroids are considered to be owned by people who man them? When you have unmanned stuff on asteroid, it is considered discarded property for anyone to take. But if you have an actual person, whatever they have under their boots is presumed theirs? Why this arrangement might come to life: Imagine UN want to avoid the race to claim the bodies in Solar system without actually using them. So you can't claim rights to what you aren't using. It's easy to fake using with mechanisms, but with humans it's harder. 

The most effective method for contraception will be infant mortality. Mind you, there will be enough for it for fertility cults to occur. Avoiding pregnancy will be considered as throwing money out of window would, today. 

Imagine someone putting a battleship over a country, always in sight, in order to threaten them to not try anything funny. Imagine tech that allows to suspend the ship is not a problem. How high is it possible to put a starship in the atmosphere in order for it to be visible clearly on sunny day? As a dark figure cast against clear sky. What's the radius in which it will be visible, on the ground, assuming Earth is the planet? What size should the ship be in order to be the size of moon from the surface? UPD: To clarify. It's not the ship's size that is a problem. It's the atmosphere. It scatters light from the sun, otherwise the skies will be dark. But, this means if we place ship outside atmosphere, it will probably not be visible unless directly between the sun and observer. Let's agree that the ship does not shine (is dark) and is visible because it blocks or absorbs light. 

Since you are in a fantasy setting anyway, why not make the material strong but light like elven chainmail? You can make a sword like Clouds (FF7) and it would still be light and strong. 

Probably somewhat painful, depending on how much you age. I would think the more prevailing sensation is weakness of limbs and a sense of lethargy as energy is sapped out as well and your cells, bones and body parts age prematurely. 

For protection, a clay encased wooden shield covered in vinegar and alum can be resistant to fire ($URL$ Leather armor treated with alum could help protect the troops as well and give the mobility that is crucial in fighting dragons whether close or far. This is just for the fire attacks though. Long barbed spears and spiked nets can hinder the dragon's movement a bit, where specialist troops can use containers filled with gunpowder to lob it at the beast. Basically bombs/grenades, since the tech does allow for it. The spears can also be used to entangle or rip at the wing membrane of the dragon if it has it. 

Go ranged. The ol' slingshot and rocks would be a decent weapon, capable of injuring any part of the body from afar without having to burden the user with too much weight and entangling their own wings and limbs with longer or unwieldy weapons. If the opponent is lightly armored (can't be very heavy since the winged human would not even be able to fly", then you would need to just need to hit their wings to make them fall or "stagger" them. You can even use short bows if this makes more sense in your world, then you can have poisoned tipped arrows and such. For the occasional melee fighting, use a "tari" or what they call "chicken knives" used on illegal cockfights. Basically a sharp hooked blade attached at the back of the ankles to to slashing attacks and since its on the legs, you can also use your arms to punch, slash, stab or any use other martial art or weapon you can think of. Makes for an interesting fighting style. 

Conscripts are fighting to avoiding turning back on their comrades. I've heard that it's the primary motivation. You might have zero incentive to risk your life, save that your inactivity will cause your pal, who you leave unprotected, will be slaughtered easily by enemy forces. Of course that won't work if everybody in the troop has zero or negative motivation, and everybody just pretend to fight. I've heard Syrian army fights like that. 

A massive release of Iron in oceans, via e.g. tectonic processes. Iron binds oxygen, forming iron oxides (that's how we get iron ores). This consumes a lot of oxygen. Augment it with carbonate-bicarbonate process that flushes carbon monoxide out of atmoshpere and into the ocean, and plants don't have enough CO2 to replenish oxygen with. 

Classical era civilizations usually lack motivation: They're the only big fish in the pond, they don't have to seriously compete with anybody, their main concern is internal instability. Roman Empire could conquer any swath of land they wanted but had troubles ruling what they already had. For them, the whole Europe and North Africa was ripe. Same thing for classical China. Capacity is here but motivation isn't. European naval powers (Portugal, Netherlands, England) had a little territory with high competition. Overseas was their only direction to expand. How you can fix this? Make landmass smaller. Archipelagoes instead of continents maybe. Several clashing classical civilizations? Note that it might fail miserably, see "invasion of sea people". Consider also exodus instead of colonization. Like flight of Aeneus to England but for real, or how there are Chinese in Indonesia. Leave in a small group, remake the place of arrival. Kinda like Andals in GoT. 

You can use terrain to your advantage. A gorge with a width opening on the enemy side narrowing down to a small opening will help to make the waves manageable. If its a flat plain, a fall back, ranged strategy might work if the plain is big enough. Couple this with area attack weapons such as mortar, bombs, mines etc. Air support (not sure what your tech level is) would also be good as they can soften up and even wipe out waves without having the ground troops go into it. Mortar, artillery etc. basically keep your distance. If your tech level permits it, then automated weapons towers could work even better and they can fire off pulses of electricity, streams of fire, or plasma etc. 

How can a population or civilization develop empathy to the point where they feel another beings emotion if they are only a few feet away regardless of species and even if they are familiar with the emotion or not. The only limitation is that they cannot broadcast emotions, just receive them. The level of empathy ability I am looking at is above what humans have today. More in line with strong telekinesis or telepathic abilities. 

While intelligent detrivores are not impossible, it may be improbable. One way I can think of to support your idea is to have the plant life or the fauna or both, excrete waste products that are actually highly beneficial to your detrivores and chemically alters their intelligence and consciousness over time to improve and expand it. Like magic mushrooms but increases your IQ, EQ etc. Hope this gives you a germ of an idea on how to proceed. 

Leave a present. When artificial radio waves are detected, blow up a mountain that the present is left under, and send your message in the skies on e.g. metallic plates in many many copies. It's not hard to choose a mountain that will not have many people around when this happens, but draws attention nevertheless. You can also think of many triggers besides radio. 

Sneak attacks will be even more popular. Much less fighting in big numbers. Maybe sophisticated traps (bear traps used as mines?). More usage of fire and poison. You really want to deliver your blow out of blue since it means it will land. 

I've read about LDS communities which permit having multiple wives. As they strongly prefer to mate inside the group, there's enormous pressure to drive boys out of the group as they get of age, for the older and powerful men to avoid competing with them for a limited pool of brides. I can imagine how they would favor girl babies knowing that girl have much greater chance of sticking around. 

You should probably start a secret order. This has upsides with becoming a god - religions change. And with starting a nation - which can be conquered. Operate a dense network of brothers in hierarchies of all dominant religions and governments of all important states. Help them with 10% of force and 90% of information (you've got to have a lot of it, being long-lived). Make them help each other while doing their jobs, especially with promotions. Make them invent complicated ranks and rituals. Make only a select few know the truth about you and make sure they never know each other. 

This will only work on a cloudless, sun intensive world (maybe a desert environment). Might give you some other ideas so here it goes. Build a long corridor with collapsed hinged floors. Rig a way for light from the sun to close the floors up so people can walk through them, but near the middle or end of the corridor before a closed and locked door, a pressure plate or a sensor, however you wish to rig it, will trigger some mechanics to align mirrors and concentrate the sun rays into that long corridor. Effectively burning anyone in it. You'd have to make sure the concentration is high enough to actually burn people in seconds, as well as make sure the mechanism specially the mirrors are well protected so thieves or archaeologists can't just break them. During the night, the floors drop so nobody can go near and its a long and wide enough corridor that its very hard to spider climb the walls. Still there may be ways to circumvent the trap such as putting up artificial lights at night or slowly building a makeshift floor at night. 

Maybe a big seasonal change occurring that is quite drastic and lasts for a year or a couple of months more than 3 (harsh winter / summer drought / galeforce winds etc.) that your people would have to migrate elsewhere. they can still come back but others may not want to so that should spread them out.
