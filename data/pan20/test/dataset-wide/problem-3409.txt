I know it doesn't actually matter which axis is which, but it seems less intuitive me. When I see a supply and/or demand graph, I always have to flip it in my head to feel like I really get what's going on. It just seems like if you have one variable (price) on which two other variables (supply and demand) depend, then the single variable should be on the horizontal axis. So why isn't this the convention? 

I was just trying to understand this myself, and I think I get it now. Let's think of it as two subquestions: 1) why should any firm ever make intermediate amounts of any good (as opposed to none, or as much of it as possible)? 2) why does the intermediate amount they should make, increase with its price? So at first I was also confused. Suppose you're selling bicycles. You want to maximize your profit. At any price, the more bicycles you sell, the more revenue you get from selling bicycles. So shouldn't you always want to make and sell as many bicycles as you possibly can, no matter what the price? For any one particular good (like bicycles): no, you shouldn't. The first insight is that making bicycles costs money, which you could have used to make and sell something else instead (or which you could have invested). That's not enough on its own, though - maybe you should just either make as many bicycles as possible, or not make any bicycles and instead make as many as possible of whichever other thing is more profitable to make and sell, i.e. has a higher price-to-cost-of-production difference. The second insight is that the marginal cost of production for a good - how much it costs to make "one more" of it - can change with how many of the good you've produced. The 10th bicycle you make, might cost more or it might cost less to make, than the first did. Economists either assume, or argue, that for many goods the marginal cost of production increases with quantity: it costs more to make the 1000th bicycle, than to make the 100th. It's not all that clear to me why, but let's take it as a given. To visualize why marginal cost of production might be important, first forget price and revenue and profit, and let's just say that for some reason you want to make as many "units" of stuff as possible. Assume for simplicity that you only know how to make bicycles and tricycles. It could be that making your first bike is cheaper than making your first trike. But assume, as economists do, that the marginal cost of production increases, for both goods. As you keep making bikes, eventually there comes a time when instead of making "one more bike", you find it more economical to switch and start making trikes instead. So if you have a fixed budget, you won't necessarily want to make no bikes at all, or make as many as possible. You'll make an intermediate number of bikes (as well as an intermediate number of trikes, such that their marginal costs of production are the same). You don't actually want to maximize the number of goods, you want to maximize profit. Define marginal profit to be the difference between price, and marginal cost of production. If the price of bikes is fixed, and the marginal cost of production increases with quantity produced, then of course the marginal profit decreases with quantity produced. You want to keep making bikes, until the marginal profit of making "one more bike" is lower than the marginal profit of making a trike instead. The higher the price of bicycles, the higher the marginal profit for bicycles, at all quantities. Therefore the higher the price of bicycles, the more you can make before the marginal profit decreases to the point where you should stop and make a tricycle instead. Therefore the higher the price of bicycles, the more bicycles you will find it profitable to make. 

A great many things can be said on the question. But it might be worth pointing out that people have been building stuff for a very very long time, so maybe 1% productivity growth is not a bad result. The most difficult is anti-corruption. You could compare the free press + independent judiciary + empowered investigative authorities within specified limits + free elections ... with the approach of President Xi, whose name is now entrenched in the Chinese constitution. However, it seems that you're more interested to motivate a specific theory. So perhaps you could develop that and come back with a question that is more aligned to what you want to know. For example, you could be additionally descriptive about what it is about Tesla's operations that might have broader lessons in construction? (Note that Tesla makes cars, not ports, not bridges and not roads.) 

Prices are easy to observe. However, they do not contain information about externalities (or other market imperfections), so while they are the most commonly used source of information by consumers and producers, it is debatable whether they are the "best" information. 

Without worrying about the precise numerical outputs, you could consider electronics purchases (perhaps subdivided by consumers, businesses and government) as a proxy for CPU consumption. (You could probably come up with some method to roughly indicate CPU power per dollar in different categories by manually figuring this out using whatever best data can substantiate that. E.g.: CPU power per dollar spent on a selection of commonly purchased TVs, laptops, phones, servers, etc.) Then, just do the analysis using electronics purchases, and don't treat the numerical outputs as important for precision, but instead for a general indication of direction of effect, or the relative size of the effect, e.g. for consumer, business and government sector electronics purchases. Explain some rationale legitimizing the use of the proxy for the question of interest, then come up with an appropriate term to reflect the question of interest in consideration of what data in fact underlies it. 

As economies become more complex and sophisticated, certain systemic risks gradually emerge and R&S jobs are needed to monitor and control these risks (e.g. the development of the banking systems in Western countries has generated the risk of systemic financial instability, as seen in the numerous banking crisis throughout the last centuries); Growth often comes through innovation, which brings disruption through the formation of new sectors of activity which tend to replace or substitute old ones. As these new sectors grow and become more mature, the limitations and risks they pose become gradually apparent to society which will ultimately demand to regulate and supervise them either through private or public action (e.g. the current debate around the use of personal data by social networks and the need to regulate it); Rogue economic actors can exploit institutional loopholes or lack of oversight to perform illegal or borderline illegal activities for their profit. Once society identifies these shortcomings, R&S is improved to avoid repetition of these unfair practices (e.g. the Enron scandal and the resulting Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US). 

I am interested in the size of what I call the regulatory/supervisory sector in Western economies. A regulatory/supervisory (R&S) activity involves either: 

Thank you @farnsy for your explanation and references, particularly Cochrane & Culp's $-$ equations $(2)$ and $(3)$ on page 61. Being more familiar with the technicalities of quantitative finance, I can give the following interpretation of the stochastic discount factor $m_t$ (SDF). Defining the SDF numéraire: $$ \forall \, t \in [s,T], \ N_t = \frac{u'(C_s)}{\beta \, u'(C_t)}=\frac{1}{m_t}$$ The price $P_t$ of the claim with payoff $X_T$ at time $T$ can be interpreted as the expectation w.r.t. the real-world probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ of the payoff discounted by the SDF numéraire: $$ P_t = \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}\left[\frac{X_T}{N_T}|\mathcal{F}_t\right]=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}\left[m_TX_T|\mathcal{F}_t\right]=\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{P}}\left[\beta \frac{u'(C_T)}{u'(C_t)}X_T|\mathcal{F}_t\right]$$ where $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is a filtration, i.e. represents the information available to the agent at time $t$. 

Domestic oligopolies could be charging uncompetitively high prices, while inflation remains low due to importing lower-priced goods in other sectors. For example, paying $20 to download a 0 marginal cost film (a much higher price resulting from oligopoly), while buying cheap imports (which helps to keep down price levels). 

If a biotechnology advance lowers the production price of corn from 3.50 dollars a bushel to 3 dollars, then farmers who do not have access to this technology now must sell at 3 dollars without enjoying any of the productivity gain, a reduction in income of 50 cents a bushel. In considering the potential truth in the statement in the textbook (with respect to the context of 2018), one must focus on the question of "who is hungry?" and not "how much food is there?" There would be more food, but the distributional effects would be negative on those most likely to be hungry. Who is hungry? Many of the people who are most likely to be hungry are poor farmers, who would simply receive a lower price and thus have less economic resources to obtain goods and services on the market. 

If the company has excess cash or excess liquidity that it cannot effectively deploy in capital investments, and it has reason to believe that the expected value of returns from purchasing shares will be higher than alternatives (such as buying equities or financial instruments), this would be legitimate, where "legitimate" can be defined as an increase in the long-term value for anyone holding shares in the company. As for determining how often this is done "legitimately", as opposed to being done manipulatively in order for inside traders to profit from reducing the supply of shares and thus illegitimately driving up prices, that's a different question. The question of whether it is "legitimate" in terms of share buybacks giving the executive board control out of proportion to shares held, this should be considered separately from the question of whether excess cash legitimizes the buyback from a long-term profit maximization perspective. As for the question of whether excess cash that cannot be deployed effectively is a sign of a "healthy economy" or not, this need not be determined by the observation of excess cash of a specific corporation considering share buybacks. For example, one company may have excess cash that it cannot deploy effectively in a situation where it expects to earn higher returns from a share buyback than investing in alternative financial assets or securities, without this necessarily applying on an economy-wide basis (which would contradict a variety of theoretical assumptions about financial markets always efficiently reallocating capital to its most profitable use ... but that could happen.) Relevant regulatory approaches to "illegitimate" share buybacks could fall under shareholder rights (other shareholders would be poorly represented by executives deciding on share buybacks to temporarily inflate share prices for their personal profit), or possibly in some cases insider trading. The regulatory framework, and its application, varies across jurisdictions. 

On the other hand, it could be argued that the size of R&S activity is not intrinsically increasing: for example, regarding point 2 above, it can be argued that as new industries replace old ones, so too do new R&S roles replace old roles. Given I believe the R&S sector can only grow in relative size over the long term, I am logically interested in understanding how this sector influences the economy and how an economy evolves as a consequence of the increasing importance of regulation and supervision. For example, it might be the case that an outsized R&S sector has similar negative effects to those due to the proliferation of rent-seeking activities. 

These functions can be accomplished either by public or private actors: for example, in the UK the Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for regulating and supervising the behavior of individuals working in the financial sector; on the other hand, auditing companies such as EY and PwC are hired to monitor whether companies comply with accounting standards. Is there any paper which studies the size of the R&S sector in the economy or its impact of the economy? Is there any economist which specializes in this? These can also be old economists from XIXth or XXth Century which thought and wrote about it. Why do I ask this? Roughly speaking, as economies (such as countries or regions) grow over time, their economic fabric becomes more complex and sophisticated as they transition to activities with higher value added. My impression is that economies will experience a continuous, long-term upward trend in the number of R&S jobs both in the public as well as in the private sector, with the portion of economic activity belonging to the R&S sector converging towards some sort of equilibrium point (I do consider the existence of R&S cycles). The need for these positions comes from different structural factors, among which:
