Logically, your argument is correct. To counter it, someone will have to go against the premises. You're saying that you must conclude that a perfect god cannot exist if man exists. This statement is about truth, not about correctness of the argument. As I said before, the argument is logically correct. This surely doesn't mean it's true though. If I assume that all horses are brown, I can conclude that there exist no white horses. This is logically correct but not true because the premises are not true. Lastly, the points you make in your argument use more premises than they say they do. For example, your step 

I won't give you a complete answer as this looks like homework, but I'll give you a hint: You need to look at the possible values of A. What is implied when A is true? And what happens when A is false? 

Charles Taylor writes in the preface of Sources of the Self (p. x, Harvard University Press 1989), emphasis mine: 

To qualify as a good driver, it is sufficient to be able to drive well and be female. However, it is not necessary, because also men can be good drivers. Consider the set W of all objects and the set X of all desired objects, giving U=W\X. A sufficient condition is a predicate s(w) such that s(w) is false for all elements in U. A necessary predicate is a predicate n(w) such that n(w) is true for all elements in X. 

Our efforts have not been predetermined, as shown above, but the importance of our efforts lies in that they strongly influence the likelihood of success in what we apply them to. I honestly hope this aids you in your quest for truth. 

It is not logically-impossible for a being to be all-knowing. The difficulty would be for any being to know for certain that they are all-knowing, since he cannot know whether there are still things he does not know. However, for such an all-knowing being to not know that he is in fact all-knowing would be a contradiction. Therefore, an all-knowing being would also have to be somehow certain that he knows everything (through means unimaginable to us who are dangerously close to the other end of the spectrum). In this case there would be two types of beings who consider themselves all-knowing: the ones who only think they are all-knowing but aren't, and the ones who think they are all-knowing and are. 

Christof was on target when he said that there is no more truth in the real world than there is in Seahaven, - if and only if you believe that truth is relative and subjective. In that case, had they surrounded Truman with Muppets all his life and made him believe that the entire planet was populated by Muppets except for Truman because Truman was an alien wizard; then that would be the truth too. I can't accept that. On the other hand, if you believe otherwise, then Christof was wrong and was just desperately trying to keep his show in business and his star/slave from quitting. It is worth noting that his argument for there being no more truth outside than inside was: "Same lies. Same deceit. But in my world, you have nothing to fear." That seems dubious and weak, so even if the statement had been true (and Christof really believed it), you could argue that Christof was not right since his belief was not justified (a.k.a. he believed it for the wrong reasons). Completely unrelated to Christof, however, there would still be people who believe that that the truth inside is true inside and the truth outside is true outside; and that both are valid truths. I can't believe that the Muppets could be a truth, and by extension I can't believe that there can be multiple truths. Similarly, I can only think of two famous proponents of this, like Gandhi: 

There are programming languages that can, thanks to lazy evaluation, store the concept of something infinite without actually having to store it in memory. For example, in Haskell one can write for the list of natural numbers, which is infinite. You can use it as long as you don't ask for the whole list. For example, you can write for the first ten natural numbers. So, there's no problem with the concept of something infinite existing in finite hardware. Also, you don't argue why we can't be simulated in infinite hardware. 

This is from Plato's Phaedo. See the list of occurrences of "learning" (click "More" for the full list). Some translations use "recollection" instead of "remembering". The basic idea is that the soul comes from the world of ideas and everything we learn in this world is really remembering something from that ideal place. See also Wikipedia on pre-existence of the soul. There is a fair summary of the Phaedo here which gives more context and explanation. From section IV: 

If we assume this god is omniscient, this idea of him believing something is difficult to imagine. How would you hold something as an opinion if you would know if it's true or not? Why would you accept that something is true without proof, if you have proof? So, it's arguable that an omniscient god does not believe anything. He knows whether he exists or not, and if we may rely on our logic to answer that question, he knows he does. This is troublesome with common notions of god because, at least in Christianity, God is considered to be omnipotent as well. So, he can do everything, and thus also believe something - even something that is not true. However, this is a paradox that already exists when accepting a god being both omniscient and omnipotent (can that god know a falsehood?), and is not a paradox introduced by your scenario. To solve this paradox is outside the scope of this answer, but one could argue that that's where your belief comes in: is your belief strong enough to handle these paradoxes? 

This being a moral question, I would say that it depends entirely on whether Country B is both directly and indirectly responsible for Country A's political and economical situation. Also, a rather huge factor would be whether half of Country B used to be Country A until the former practically stole it from the latter. 

No, the State would not be responsible. As you state yourself, all of the rulings mentioned pertain to situations where the police are involved. The gun-control issue has nothing to do with the police, thereby voiding any precedent you tried to establish before posing the question. It would be hard to prove that the individual getting assaulted in the example would not have gotten assaulted anyway if gun control legislature had not been passed. In fact, the opposite is just as likely to be true: that individual may have gotten assaulted exactly because the assaulter had easier access to a gun thanks to gun control legislation not getting passed. It would be hard to imagine someone arguing that the State was responsible for the assault because the gun-control legislation was not passed. It is even possible that the person assaulted would've gotten assaulted on multiple occasions instead of just once if previous gun-control legislation had not been passed. 

Here is a proof using the law of excluded middle. After eliminating the existential quantifier to get x, apply the universal quantification on x itself to get E(x,x) ↔ ¬E(x,x). This is false if E(x,x) is true or false. 

NB: this is the same as your suggestion to "place a column in the truth table that represents P^(P->Q) to see that every time this is true then Q is also true", however, I preferred to show you the mathematically correct way to solve any logical problem. 

Consider the set B of lawbreaking actions, and the subset W &subset; B of wrong lawbreaking actions. We know that |W| &approx; |B| (the number of elements in W is approximately equal to the number of elements in B) by premise 1. Now consider the set DP of double parking actions. We know DP &subset; B by premise 2. Also consider the set WDP = DP ∩ W of wrong double parking actions (all elements that are in both W and DP). The conclusion now says that |WDP| &approx; |DP|. However, this does not follow from what we know. As a toy example, take B = {1,2,3,...,10} and W = {1,2,3,...,9}. Clearly, most elements in B are in W, so premise 1 is fulfilled. Now suppose DP = {10}. We then have WDP = &emptyset; (empty set). Obviously the conclusion, most DP are in W, is incorrect: no element from DP is in W. Intuitively, this is because DP contains precisely those elements from B that are not in W. 

The events of the world are not predetermined, as shown above, they are what we do with the world around us by using our free will to decide between things that are possible for us. In the same manner, our thoughts are mostly common/usual responses that each individual's brain has as a result of repetition. We can slowly change the way we think, as well as the nature of our thoughts; this means that we have some measure of free will even in our thoughts. Our effort is the amount of work/energy we decide to apply to something; and if we had some measure of free will when it came to our thoughts, we have all of it when it comes to the amount of effort we decide to apply to something. 

Yes, to equate the brain to a hardware system and the mind to software; and then say that the brain causes all the changes and activity of the mind is indeed like saying that the system's hardware causes all the changes and activity of the software. All software is made by programmers, even if the software they made is somehow capable of writing its own software. In such a case, the new software written by the original software would be the intellectual property of the programmer, and not of the original software. Just like a pie made by a pie-making machine would belong to the maker of the machine, and not to the machine. The same applies to the hardware, it was made by engineers. The problem is perhaps that the analogy is less than perfect and only goes so far. 

So also in this writing which is not part of "the Bible" we read that also the opponents agreed that the tomb was empty – just not why. 

Yes, it looks fine to me. You could make your third sentence more convincing by explaining the relation between the length of the formula (what would be a good measure?) and the size of the tree. 

This is very similar to Thomas Aquinas' second 'way'. Aquinas was a 13th century catholic philosopher and wrote Quinque viæ, five ways to God. The second is The Argument of the First Cause. The five ways are controversial and very debatable. Richard Dawkins famously criticised them in The God Delusion. He claims it is a form of special pleading to say that everything except god must have a cause. This is a fallacious argument where something is an exception to a general rule, while the exception isn't justified. In your case, you don't justify why god can be an exception to your first premise that everything is caused. Also, you don't justify your second premise, that an infinite regress is impossible. It doesn't seem to be very compatible with the Big Bang, however, it isn't impossible once you refute that theory. For more info, see eternal return.
