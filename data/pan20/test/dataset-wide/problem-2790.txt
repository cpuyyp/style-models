Read every word, with particular attention to unfamiliar vocabulary. Nietzsche, as a philologist, was particular about his lexical and syntactic choice, I'm sure. Performing a close read of the text will benefit you enormously, particularly when you understand the then contemporary, historical meaning of his words and phrases, for which you will need the aid of footnotes and research. Taking his words merely for granted in the modern definitions and ideations proves inaccurate. Of course, what you are reading is a translation, which I am not qualified to evaluate, but a keen attention to every word, sentence, and paragraph will fully bring you into the experience, and set you up for the next "step". Note the stylistic, punctuational choices. You will notice that many texts use italicized, parenthesized, or hyphenated text, which to me at any rate, presents a thrilling experience for reading. And this makes sense, given Nietzsche's own opinions on how to write effectively, and I believe such mechanics were present in his original drafts. Feel the words, the phrasing, the tempo, the gravitas, of what you are reading, as it will convey far more emotion and impression than a mere clinical clean read. It should 'disturb' you and make you think, which prepares you for the next "step". Read the text again, but at a different time. If you have this luxury, try reading the text after some time off, or perhaps in a different mood (one that is still conducive to reading, though). You may be surprised, offended, or confused by what he writes, which dangerously lends to the temptation of dismissing his ideas and style. Understand that he may be speaking ironically, craftily, or earnestly, but all with intent and purpose. He is not an easily philosopher to understand! Ruminate! This is the most important step, and is not necessarily the last. Think, think, think, about what you have read, and consider the implications of his writing. Nietzsche was extraordinarily productive and crams so much in so little space. Think, at any point in time in your reading or even just in the everyday, about what could have led him to write what you read, and that exactly, and not something else. Think about particular paragraphs, sentences, even words, but without forgetting an understanding of the overarching themes of his message. 

This question is difficult to answer because the idea of a "philosophical question" is very vague. The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast begins with Thales of Miletus (7th Century BCE), and a number of sources list him as the first identifiable philosopher in the Western tradition. However in a more general sense you would also be able to argue that philosophy has existed almost as long as society - any parent who has had to explain to their questioning child why it is important to treat other people well, for example, could be said to be "doing philosophy" in a broad sense. 

You are correct that the idea appears in Plato's Republic, though it may also appear elsewhere. I believe that section 521 is the reference you are looking for, though it may appear in other places in the text as well: 

The question isn't particularly clear about what you mean by "what kind" of argument, however Modal Logic primarily deals with the possibility and necessity of statements like the one in the question. Probability is a different option that is used in various systems (such as multi-valued logics that assign each proposition a probability value such as 0.7, with computations from those). In modal logic, your argument would be written as follows: 

More or less the question title. My final-year logic course a few years back covered a number of non-classical logics (deontic, Kleene/Lukasiewicz multi-valued, etc.), however dialetheism was left as little more than a footnote in spite of a somewhat important name in the area being from the same university. I would like to read a little more on the topic to actually understand what is going on, and I'm looking for the first work that introduced it as a serious, defend-able position under the assumption that it is likely to have a reasonable explanation of the fundamental argument in the face of the obvious initial objections. 

Of course, these three questions are just microscopic inquiries when approaching and evaluating religious thought and its titanic impact on society throughout the ages and different parts of the world. Furthermore it is important to distinguish between the individual actions and beliefs of religious folk in sometimes contradistinction to the official teachings and promulgations of the central religious body. Furthermore, are you referring to the Abrahamic religions? The Hindu religion? Those of the Far East? These are certainly big questions, but perhaps you could refine the approach and adjust the focus through one of many scientific lenses. This already sounds like a topic that would suggest familiarizing yourself with the English biologist Richard Dawkins, who has written a number of books on the matter. Best of luck. Edit: I figured I better append my response with the clarification that the vast majority of human beings are not subject to the same evolutionary forces and principles that act upon populations in the wild. But it is still worthwhile to consider how religiosity might affect the favorability of traits and behaviors. 

As with many instances in the progression of intellectual history, in order to understand the now, it is important to understand what has come before the now. With specificity to Nietzsche, it is important to recognize the influences of European philosophers, psychologists, scientists, and even musicians upon him (an aside, music was an important aspect of his life). Specifically, such names that come to mind are Schopenhauer, Kant, Hegel, Darwin, and who can forget Wagner! Each of these individuals, and more, produced an impact upon his thinking, whether in his approval or disapproval of their ideas, or even more analytically, a strange, sometimes ironic mixture of both. I highly suggest reading Friedrich Nietzsche by Curtis Cate, who crafts an excellent and truly enlightening biography of the personal and intellectual history of Nietzsche, which has helped enormously in understanding his later works. I think it somewhat vain for me to try to "correctly" answer how to "properly" read Nietzsche (or any philosopher for that matter), so I will outline how I approach his texts. Remember, this is after having read the biography mentioned above and having gained the reference, context, and knowledge of the milieu and events surrounding the numerous inceptions-and completions-of his many works. Furthermore, the astounding work of Nietzsche scholars (such as Walter Kaufmann) in the form of historical and comparative research has produced conveniently organized footnotes in most texts that I urge you not to ignore. This advice, I think, is also not particular to Nietzsche, but is a generally helpful and advantageous approach to reading philosophy in general. And as a final note, do not forget that the English text is and always will be a translation of the original German; take that as you will. For larger, continuous works (i.e., not aphorisms): 

The apparent need of the soul to always think, that Locke struggles with, seems to reflect the influence of Descartes (Locke was born in 1632, 36 years after Descartes). It was Descartes's influential thesis that the soul just is a thinking substance. That is, that the whole being of the soul consists in thinking. And this seems to entail the (apparently absurd conclusion) that the soul exists only when it thinks. So that if the soul exists continuously, it must think continuously! And as to the division of the person during sleep, Locke derived it from the assumption that personal identity requires self-awareness. Since the waking person is presumably not self-aware of the sleeping person's experiences, and vice versa, they must be two distinct persons. 

Now, for any controversial object, e.g. Batman, there will be a sense (s1) in which it exists, and another sense (s2) in which it doesn't exist. So we have: 

One could say that the existentialists advocated second-order values (authenticity, free choice, responsibility, caring) while Rand also advocated specific first-order values (like being financially independent). So that, for example, in a conflict between a capitalist and a communist, an existentialist could view both sides as commendable (as authentic). Rand would describe the capitalist as good, and the communist as evil. 

I'm afraid that determinism (determinate future) is a consequence of unrestricted bivalence, as Aristotle points out. If either "there will be a sea battle tomorrow" or "there won't be a sea battle tomorrow" is true today, then the future is already fixed today i.e. in advance. As to the wonder, how a logical principle might have metaphysical consequences, I think the answer is that for Aristotle (and for many others) logic is related to metaphysics. Logic is only partially an independent realm. Some if its principles are based on metaphysical considerations, and have metaphysical consequences. Thus concerning the sea battle problem, Aristotle concludes that bivalence does not hold for potential existence, only for actual existence. This is a metaphysical distinction. 

If you wish to claim that, historically in the West and near East, the imposition of the will of a religious body against other actors within society has delayed 'inevitable' advancements in the technological, social, scientific, and philosophical realms, then you are essentially correct and do not need to look far for instances of historical evidence. Mind you, this is a phenomenon that is not unique to religion. Now whether or not 'religions' necessarily preclude or at least discourage secular 'innovation' is much less clear, and difficult to prove. Attempting to do so would require a massive surveying of history since early Christianity, and perhaps even before, and would become an interdisciplinary approach. Attempting to isolate the effects of religious forces on society would prove even more difficult a task, so instead I shall attempt to opine on your thoughts. Essentially, it can of course be argued from an evolutionary perspective that predominately those organisms (in this case, humans) that can change and adapt positively to the flux of the environment are better suited to survive and perpetuate their genealogy. "Innovation" is a just sophisticated term to describe the human version of this effect, that is, the engaging of the mental, physical, and sometimes social faculties in order to improve the standard of living, and therefore the likelihood of survival, and ultimately, procreation, to continue the evolutionary argument. Adopting this view is consistent with your proposal of how innovation manifests and what it entails. The difficult question I think you are implicitly posing is whether or not the ideas and attitudes that accompany (theistic) religious piety has an evolutionary advantage, or disadvantage. E.g., 

"Of what benefit could Christian altruism possibly be to me?" (when it could disadvantage you?) "Why should I obey the teachings of Christ and 'love my neighbor' when he has clearly wronged me?" (when you could be physically harmed?) "What need is there for secular morality when I have the teachings of the Bible and the canons of the Church?" 

Yes. In particular, the philosophy of the Australian moral philosopher Peter Singer takes this point of view in some cases. He does not argue that, for example, any given pidgeon has a higher 'value' than all human beings but instead that there is a sliding scale where it is possible in some cases for animals to have more worth than humans (essentially that there is nothing inherent in humans that makes us superior). This has lead to much controversy - Following this principle there may be cases where you should prioritize saving a very gifted chimpanzee from a burning house rather than a heavily disabled human, and this has been interpreted by some people as a complete devaluation (I can't think of a better word right now) of disabled people in general. EDIT: It really depends on what problems you are trying to cover, but if the above seems relevant to your interest then you might want to take a further look into the areas of (moral) utilitarianism, bioethics and discussions on the intrinsic value of animals/people. 

From the premise of the initial quote that the argument is valid there can be no case where you are posing the antecedent's statement (W ∧ X ∧ Y) as true and the consequent (C) false. Thus, it is a tautology as there is no case in which the statement itself is false. (Note that this necessitates that W,X,Y includes ALL premises of the argument we know to be valid, not just some subset of them.) 

This is perfectly valid (albeit trivial), and from that point of view there is nothing wrong with it. Introducing a premise that has nothing to do with the conclusion is not a sign of invalidity, but may be a sign that the argument has been lazily constructed (if the author does not realise that it is unrelated), that the argument has a secondary function other than proving the conclusion (an anecdote may contain evidence to a conclusion, but also contain irrelevant information to be entertaining at the same time), or because they are trying to underhandedly overcomplicate things or insert concepts that have no relevance in order to make the conclusion more palatable (see: politicians). None of this makes the argument invalid as far as logic goes. You could, however, make the point that because of this the person is arguing poorly (or at least sub-optimally), but the abstraction of language to logic and argumentation as we teach in philosophy classes is not one-to-one with the usage of language in real life.
