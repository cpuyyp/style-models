I'd like to add to the correct answers already given. Solids can flow and deform without being a liquid. You can bend iron bars. You can dent plastic. You can squeeze nylon bags. The cotton on your t-shirt bends as you move you hand. These are all solids. The ability of this to happen depends on temperature and pressure. Iron bars bend easier when heated. I'm sure you know that freezing (already solid) objects with liquid nitrogen makes them much more brittle. The most obvious difference between solids and liquids is their ability to deform, but that does not mean that only liquids do it. Liquids do not have crystal structures, whereas (some) solids do. Take H2O: water is liquid, but ice is solid. However, glaciers can deform and move. All in the solid state. Metamorphic rocks deform, in the solid state. Once we accept that solids can deform without being liquid, the ability to sustain convection cells and density-based stratification are not surprising. Fill in a box with gummi bears, then drop a huge block of steel on to it. Eventually the candy will flow upwards while the steel block will sink. All of this will happen in the solid state. 

First, a short introduction to incompatible elements The Earth's mantle is mostly composed of the minerals olivine, pyroxene, anorthite, spinel and garnet. These minerals are made from the elements Si, Al, Fe, Mg and Ca. In the figure below I've put them in the MRFE field (Mantle Rock Forming Elements). The trace elements, the elements that occur in very low concentrations, do not form their own minerals and instead are incorporated into the crystal lattice of the common minerals. This is easy in the case elements that share the radius and charge with the major elements because they can easily fit into the crystal lattice (for example Ni in olivine, Cr in clinopyroxene). Most elements, however, plot out of the MRFE field in the figure and are considered incompatible elements. That is, in the case of mantle melting, these incompatible elements are partitioned to the magma and eventually migrate with it when it goes to form new rocks (for example basalts). Because different processes and conditions of mantle melting result in different patterns and contents of incompatible elements in the new rocks, we can learn about the mantle melting process by studying these elements in more accessible rocks (such as basalts in volcanoes). Note that I am referring to incompatible elements as incompatible with respect to mantle minerals. In some crustal rocks K, Na and Ti become major elements. In that case the MRFE should be renamed CRFE (Crustal Rock Forming Elements) and expanded to include these elements as well. 

It is confusing - both rocks are commonly pink overall. But, granite has abundant quartz, syenite has no quartz to very little. Quartz will be the grey translucent mineral that looks just like a blob with no distinct shape. You can use this website: $URL$ to see examples of syenite and granite (use the search box). 

Theoretical answer: You need to measure extinction angles. If it is always extinct when aligned to cleavage or crystal faces, then it is orthorhombic. If it sometimes aligns and the colour is consistent, it's monoclinic. Otherwise it's triclinic. You do not need to know how cleavage is oriented with respect to the axes in advance because there very few orthorhombic minerals with oblique cleavage (if any at all). Practical answer (and a rant): I have no idea why is this still taught in 2016. The motivation of this thing is to know optical properties so you can derive chemical information from them. These days it's probably cheaper and faster to put the sample in XRD or SEM-EDS to know what it is. Even when three colours exist, it is usually very subtle and you will need a lot of self-convincing to see the third colour on its own and not as a combination of the other two. Then there's the issue of a real mineral actually having a proper crystal shape and cleavage (good luck doing this on a 10 micrometre wide anhedral crystal in a thin section). 

I'd like to add a bit to Jezibelle's answer. First of all, you could do a simple chemical test to test for iron, but that would not give you much. Iron oxides on the surface are extremely insoluble in water. You would either have to use LOTS of soil and water to test it, or use acids that will dissolve it and then it's not a simple test anymore. Another reason is that assuming you do that test, it is going to be positive for iron. Andesite has iron in it. This and just about every other rock you can find have iron in it. Those that don't, are not red. The colour that you're seeing is enough proof that there's iron in it. Now the question is which iron oxide is it. Pure hematite ($\ce{Fe2O3}$) is deep dark red. Pure goethite ($\ce{FeO(OH).H2O}$) is yellow. But then you have everything in between, and mixtures (given the general name: limonite). Now remember, iron is not the only constituent of soil. Silicon is the most abundant metal in soils, followed by aluminum, sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium (not necessarily in that order). These elements can combine with iron to form stuff that doesn't even have to be red. It can be grey, black, green and everything in between.

Here's an idea: You can use dark chocolate and white chocolate. Use a grater to create "sediments": layers of alternating grated dark and white chocolate. Now heat them up just before melting so you can stick them together with pressure, preserving the layered structure. Now fold them. There's your "metamorphic" rock. Then, just melt the entire thing to create some chocolate-lava flows. Grate them again and eat! 

Fast exhumation is not necessary to retain blueschist mineral assemblage. This is the classical difference between prograde and retrograde metamorphism, and it's not limited to blueschists. Why do we have eclogite on Earth's surface? What about granulites? Amphibolites? In fact, why do we see any metamorphic rocks on the surface instead of just various clays and quartz? There are two main reasons for that.
