Simply put, you are paying for the research and development that it takes to produce the top end framesets and groupsets. It takes a lot of time, trial, drafting, creating, testing, and reiteration of all the above steps to create a marketable product that also performs. (To some extent, you are also paying for the free product that goes to sponsored teams, but that is much smaller slice of the pie). The good news, especially if you are working from a limited budget, is that you don't necessarily need the top end, current year models, unless you are intending on riding it for quite some time, or you really do need the small edge that the latest and greatest will give you. The reason for this is that technology trickles down year after year, and/or you can purchase top of the line a couple years later for a much cheaper price. I don't know the exact rate at which technology does move down, but the current SRAM Force group (Their mid range groupset), is probably just as good or better than the Red groupset of a few years ago, because as the Red group evolves to be better, they don't get rid of the older tech, it just bumps down a level and becomes Force, and the old Force bumps down to Apex, etc etc. (That is very simplified, but basically true). Or, because you don't need that slight edge, you can buy a used group a couple years down the line for much less than new. The same holds true for bike frames. While the newest framesets have all the aerodynamic and construction/design tweaks that hours in the wind tunnel produce, you can easily get a top of the line frame from a few years ago and reap most of the advantages that you would need. For a long time, the gold standard in triathlon frames was the Cervelo P3, which outperformed just about every frame around, even 4-5 years after initial release. Yes, it's always fun to get the new shiny, but unless you are at the pointy end of the spectrum, you will get much more bang for your buck buying a few years old. 

Maybe FD is broken. Check if it does shakes. Maybe whole crank is bent - not separate teeth. Check whether the crank is closer to frame at one point. 

Gears could become unaligned (if it's happens all the time) if the derailleur got bent. If it's not bent, it should work perfect for years. Pedal arm should not become loose if had a good assemble. It should be checked from time to time, may require some tighten. But if it becomes loose fast, it's bad assemble. And at this point you can find many answers on this site, that once it became loose, it's shape damages, and in most cases will loose again. Sometimes the axle itself got damaged and then you should replace the arm and the axle. Buying a bike for about 450-600$ should come with: 

It's just like you wrote: When you testing rear brakes, you should test it backwards. If you will push bike forward while there is no load on the rear wheel, it will slide, and, the same will be if you test front brakes and pushing the bike backwards - the tire will slide on the ground. That is also caused when you are riding, that's why when braking with rear brakes you should seat and move your weight backwards to put more load on the wheel and prevent sliding. And remember not to apply to much force to the brakes when stoping, because if your tire will slide too hard, it will wear on this place and can even create a hole in the tire. 

It has been long enough since this question was originally asked for helmets to have adapted. Currently there is a model of bicycle helmet that is full face, and used for downhill bicycle racing. Most (if not all) of these are certified according to the ASTM F1952 standard, which is a more rigorous standard than the CPSC (Consumer Products Safety Commission), which is a US based safety certification that all recommended bicycle helmets are required to have in the US (I believe foreign models sold in the US must either meet or exceed CPSC standards). The models will also list what standards they conform to, such as the list on the Bell Transfer helmet page. If you look at current models such as the ones at Chain Reaction Cycles (Warning, link may decay), they are full face such as ski racing and motorcycle, and will accommodate goggles such as ski goggles. Add a head covering such as a balaclava or similar and you should be fine. 

They are unstable because of how your weight shifts on the bike when you move to the aerobars. Hybrids are not really designed to have aerobars, the geometry doesn't really lend itself to that. My suggestion would be to get rid of the aerobars, and get handlebar extensions for the ends of the bars, much like you see on many mountain bikes. This will allow you to switch between different hand positions, while still keeping control and weight distribution where it should be. Bike geometry- The main difference is in the seat tube and head tube angles. As you go from a hybrid (upright riding posture, slack seat tube angle) to a road bike (slightly more leaning forward, steeper seat tube angle) to a time trial frame (leaning on forearms, even steeper seat tubes), you progressively move the weight on the frame further forward. There are also differences in how the bottom bracket is placed in relation to the ground/seat, etc. that are designed to produce a more comfortable ride. As the weight shift forward happens, the handling of the bike is different. TT frames are notoriously poor handlers compared to road frames, and hybrids handle much different than a traditional road frame. So when you move forward on the hybrid like you would for aerobars, you are moving the weight/center of gravity out of the "sweet spot" for the frame, and handling deteriorates as a result. 

The chain has to go pretty straight. The position you put it in - from big to big - is actually not the right position, so you should avoid this. But for the theory of your question: the derailleur leads your chain. While you pedaling the right way forward, rear derailleur leads the chain to rear cogs, and front derailleur to the chainrings. But when you pedal back you get the opposite. Now front derailleur leads the chain to rear cogs trying to adjust the chain to derailleur's position. Next it comes to the rear derailleur: the chain comes from the second cog now, but your derailleur is adjusted to a larger cog, there your chain jams. If you did it by mistake while riding, sometimes moving derailleurs and then pedaling forward helps. 

Mainly if your cable is too loose, you should tighten it with the screw at the derailleur bottom. From your comment about shifting gears, i guess that it's the time to you to replace the cable (thou on the pic it looks pretty nice). The cable can stick (not shift down) because of two reasons: 1) it's dirty (or rusty on cheap cables), 2) it's bent. In the first case you can try to clean it with wd40 (to do it you have to remove the cable housing from the bosses, and spray the wd40 into the housing). In the second case you should get all the housings off, and examine the cable for bents that inside the housings, and that's almost equivalent to replace the cable (but with no cost, and potentially it will not work). 

Everything I described above happened and I would not recommend running a clearly faulty BB for too long. I believe a BB using bearing cartridges might not fail as catastrophically as one with simple cages like the one pictured but I doubt it would end well in the long term. 

A geared bike main advantage over single/fixed gear bikes is to keep you at an efficient cadence over a wide range of speeds. This is particularly important when riding up hills. I find that on flat courses, and in the absence of strong headwinds, that advantage become quite small if you choose the correct gearing on your single speed. A single/fixed gear bike is simpler, lighter and more efficient than a similarly priced geared bike. This is particularly true of a fixed gear bike which greatly reduce energy loss in the drive train. So for a repeatable commute without steep climbs, you can select the gearing on your single speed to help you reach your optimal speed, based on your fitness. If you know your functional threshold power (FTP) this can be done quite easily. Use the bike calculator to calculate the speed you can theoretically achieve on your bike and course. Then use the other bike calc to work out what gearing will keep you at your preferred cadence for that speed. As an example if my FTP is 250W and I want to ride at around 80% effort, I'll enter a 200 Watt effort, my body weight, bike weight, riding position into the the first calculator, which gives me a speed around 31km/h. 

This is similar to this question on frame size, however that is addressing it from a road bike standpoint. My wife is 4' 9", and I am interested in getting her a mountain bike, as she has expressed interest in hauling the kids back and forth to local parks, etc, in a trailer. We had a child's bike previously, that was...clunky at best. It doesn't need to be full suspension (Truthfully doesn't need to be front suspension either, although I suspect there aren't any of those around any more). The frame size charts that I've seen all stop at 4'11" for the shortest, with a recommended frame size of 13-15". Will that be sufficient, or will I need to possibly look at kid sized mountain bikes? Her body morphology is normal (No overly short legs with larger torso, etc), so everything is in proportion. 

This picture is of a top triathlete. Note that the forearms are almost parallel, and the upper arms are at a 90 degree angle. This allows the main support for the upper body to rest on the bone structure, with minimal muscle involvement. (Stadler was an Ironman distance triathlete, bike segment of 112 miles). While you may see variations on this, it is a general truism that the longer the race, the more comfort trumps aerodynamics, and vice versa (Short races aerodynamics trumps comfort.) Many of the ultra mountain bike competitors set up their rides similarly, and have "wrap" style aerobars that allow them multiple different hand positions for control, as well as the resting position where their arm muscles don't have to do the work for support. That all being said, I would point out that many riders go much further than 40 miles with no pain at all. This would suggest to me that your fit is not correct, or that you are not in shape enough for a 40 mile ride yet. Tailbone pain is (usually) a bad saddle and fit, and the rest is also easily attributable to fit. Aerobars will not be a magic cureall for an improperly fitted bike 

Their only purpose is to limit the lever for one that has small hands (typically - children). They have no other use, so you can safely remove them. 

This puncture made from outside - the glass isn't inside the tube, but did you get it out of the tire? Is your tire intact? Did you hear the tube blowing up? It looks like your tire have something that punctures the tube. It maybe a glass in it, or metal hoop that inside tire bead came out, or the tire sniped in some place. As every time when you install the tube you rotate the tire, the puncture will be at another place on the tube. 

If only one side is creaking, it's probably the pedal or crank arm not screwed tight. So first tight them up (for the pedal you probably need a special wrench, for crank arm it's a 8mm hex or 14mm wrench). You should tight it as fast as you can, as it can brake the crank arm. When both sides are creaking, it could be that both sides are loose, but it also can be a problem in wheels i.e. spokes are loose, or hub is broken, or it can be the BB. Those are the much common problems, but as @mattM linked at sheldon brown, it can be other things as well.
