You have portrayed your Lodge not only as the prevailing order, but as a house of peacekeepers whose purpose is in "helping the world and all its peoples". They also have free reign and hold no one sovereign to themselves. As to whether they are involved or passive with regards to external events you haven't made their nature apparent. To truly "control" (bad word) everyone and keep the peace everywhere they would also have to be everywhere. They do not bow to the rules of these places and seem to have the power to enforce their will even with resistance, which could of course be avoided with diplomatic lubrication. This can be resolved by having the equivalent of embassies in major locations for fast response time, a larger coverage and easier access to the state of affairs in many places. With this they should receive ample warning of impeding threat and could from these forward bases of operation dissuade or prevent altercations well in advance. By having an embassy everywhere they ensure a face of neutrality and can under this mask of neutrality target and deal with any single party which is a legitimate offender to "rules" without siding with that party's enemies. Their paring with otherworldly beings also differentiates them from their charges and passively separates them in a way that gives them further "superiority" and claim to declare oneself such a powerful peacekeeping entity. Should all these precautions fail and the hand is forced. The lodge would most likely seek a path that keeps closest to its ideals while still ensuring its survival. They have shown to be willing to take precarious, possibly risky decisions to achieve their ends. One would assume they could resort to drastic means. As to which "side" in an option of two. Most likely the one where they survive, if survival is more important than risking becoming something one doesn't wish to be. 

It could be a cultural/religious thing, like the Amish. I know - you said that it shouldn't be a superstitious/religious thing, but in my experience, Amish people don't use certain technology for pragmatic/community based reasons more than for religious reasons. Many Amish families families DO use technology. They use telephones, they use diesel engines in mills, battery powered tools, cash registers, and propane refrigerators, and when they hire out to do work for the English they ride in cars as passengers, and some groups of Amish use tractors on their farms - So they do use technology, but they also use animals for many things that we've replaced with mechanical tools. They're very selective about what technology they use, with the idea that what they use shouldn't impact their way of life, but instead protect it. I'm not an expert on Amish thought, so I can't say exactly all of their reasons, but here you're just looking for a reason for people to do or not do something - and the Amish people's philosophical model of not using a technology because it doesn't fit within their community might be a good fit. It's not that they can't do it - they just don't believe that they should. 

on the noteside: i think the best detention is to focus in the enemy's most pride unit, or the costliest one. if their land ship is the symbol of power, then focus in destroy them. it's not only demoralize, but also make the war become less cost-effective. also, the object should focus in weaken the enemy and make them vulnerable again other empires, rather than in defeat or stop them on track; just show them that whatever they got from you is not worth the risk for it. 

Out of the way Simply put, don't block their fleet's way. Your main reason to be invaded is your strategic location, so just offer it to any passer-by. Sweden let German pass, so they were cool. Thailand and Belgium (in WW1) didn't, so they got invaded. Simple. Everyone's friend Again, look at Sweden and Thailand. While they let the Axis force pass, they also harboured Allies spies, so everyone just cool with them. Your planet could act like an espionage hub for everyone, a neutral ground for some secret diplomacy, a safe haven for refugees from all sides. You could also create some small organizations that align with different faction, but secretly be control by the goverment. Summary To put it simple, make they understand that your value as an independent planet is much higher than as someone's pawn. Give them what they want the most, then give some unique bonus that allow them to look over you. 

Let's give this a stab by starting to appeal to all the conspiracy theorists and consider the first possible time frame "Ground Zero". Along with the black suit syndrome, we don't know the unknown people (organisation X) who would be at G0 seconds before the projectiles (pod and ship) hit their likely calculated impact points (Let's say X has abundant resources and power to remain hidden from us common folk - be as creative as you need ie. able to intercept satellite/government/intelligence etc. to mislead their predictions of the orbital entry or crash). Case X - A: Assume that X somehow had prior knowledge of the existence of the newcomers. If relations were diplomatic -> a search/rescue/recovery and cleanup of evidence would take place (Lots of question about media footage with no answers still preferable to spilled beans). If relations were hostile (ship was possibly compromised by X to begin with) -> cleanup of survivors + evidence. Case X - B: X is just caught off guard like the rest of the world but they still want the information first, and if need be contained. They would likely undergo recon with risk assessment, capture/detain/eliminate hostile survivors. And attempt to clean up the scene. Entering slightly more realistic ground and say X doesn't exist or is otherwise occupied with more pressing concerns. Considering there was ample coverage and warning (uncompromised by X) of the craft's approach, countries or areas expecting the crash in their yard will likely have prepared a military/scientific/media resource at the site. Likely in that order. To first secure the situation and ensure the craft or its passengers pose no immediate aggressive threat. Followed by an investigation into the specifics of the craft/passengers/crash and the environmental threats they could pose. Concluded lastly by allowing/or not the media to disclose details of the event. As to what happens afterwards and who gets custody of the evidence, it's unlikely that a single government could cover up or lay claim to such an event (A claims crash site, B claims orbital entry into their skies, C claims debris, D claims death of civilians... etc.). I suspect a panel/convention/union of countries would be formed with regards to which decisions will be taken. Most likely these decisions will lead to scientific investigation for the most of the foreseeable future. Information released would most likely be that deemed safe enough to release to the public, or that necessary to control and keep the public calm. On a global scale there could be religious turmoil or similar such which would claim to explain the existence of the ship. 

great chance of success since your country is surrounded by mountain, and the enemy have land-ship to move around, it quite safe to say the invasion route will be pretty much fixed. that mean the enemy will have to walk pass your traps if they want to advance. easy to carry well, much easier than carry a big cannon. that allow you to plant them in unexpected place, like a bridge inside enemy's territory, a supply storage, etc.. also, since you dont need many people to plant a mine, you could send many team to simply littering the country with land mines. hard to avoid without any metal detector, the only way to find mine is either: a. dig up every road ahead and b. send a guy to "check". if they choose a. , you can always re-mine a clear route and they will have to dig it up again. if they choose b. , mix anti-personnel mine with anti-landship one and let them figure out themselve. multipurpose when not busy blowing up people and things, mine can be used for many other purposes. they can be used to creat landslide or avalanche, to make boulder to block a road etc. and the most important.. losing a few mines dont have any significant setback for you, while losing your single superweapon is an instant gameover. heck, if your can place your plant behind the 2nd line of defense, then you can keep going even after your barony has been overruned. 

One of the dangers I worry about when I see questions like this is that you're trying to world build yourself into a story rather than building a universe around the story you want to tell. 

Islands roughly like Hawaii could not support 100k hunter gatherers. At it's height, the Hawaiian islands only supported a population of about 160k people and that was only possible through intensive agriculture. Without agriculture, the only real easily available food sources that Hawaii had were birds and fish, and there wouldn't be enough of them to feed 100k people. Tom Dye says in his book, Population trends in Hawaii before 1778, "By the time of Cook's visit, the lowland forests of the Hawaiian islands had been greatly altered by more than a millennium of industrious gardening." What that means is that you're going to either need to adjust the technology that the population has available to it, or reduce the number of people that are in the population. Also, the amount of land required to support 100k people will need to be pretty vast - especially if you're considering it to be roughly equivalent to Hawaii, with it's topography created by vulcanism - there will only be a certain amount of usable land and the rest will either be on hillsides too steep to farm or otherwise unusable. This means populations will be concentrated into farming communities in the lowlands. You aren't going to have cities - instead you might have large villages. This makes a central leadership and communication difficult and unlikely. The kingdom of Hawaii didn't exist until 1795 and wasn't fully unified until 1810 - this largely through the instigation and technology of westerners. See the Wikipedia article here. You may run into the situation that the Spanish did when they conquered the Aztecs - they happened to meet with other groups of Native Americans, like the Cloud Warriors, who happened to be in the middle of a fight with the Aztecs and who used the Spanish and their technology as an opportunity conquer them. Any way you look at it, the end result is bad if if the natives fight. They need to make some powerful western friends quickly or they're screwed. 

a net. Sound strange enough, since you can't kill anyone with a net. But for an avian race, getting tangled up and fall from the sky would be pretty much lethal. However, it's not the main point. Because it's stone-age, your crow won't fight in open battle, but raiding -just like the native American warfare. And that's where a net come in handy. 

So in my world, there is something called magic energy: a form of energy that can be control and, you know, do magic stuff. Like normal energy, they can not be created or destroyed, but only change form. At somepoint in history, my human learned how to "harvest" energy in the surrounding and transform them into magic. These energy input can be heat, wind, sound, light or biological etc. And here the question. (Disclaimer: it may sound basic or even stupid, but i just can't wrap my head around) "Can you darken the sky by (purely) harvesting too much light energy?" This mage harvest energy in a 30-meter radius, and light energy will immediately transform when they enter the zone. Would it result in a 30-meter dome of shade in the midnoon? I understand that it would mean a tremendous amount of energy, but this mage can do that. it could be equal to hundreds of the Hiroshima bomb and still be okay: the scale is not a problem.
