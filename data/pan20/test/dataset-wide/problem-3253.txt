Another example, more recent, is Churchill's speech to the House of Commons on June 4, 1940, particularly the final paragraph though his rhythm and repetition occurs throughout the speech to a lesser degree. Again a fine example of free verse. Churchill's speech served multiple purposes. Firstly it needed to inspire the British people to continue the war. Secondly it needed to send a firm message to Hitler and Roosevelt that Britain was continuing the fight even without France. Thirdly it was part of a campaign by Churchill to obtain 50 moth-balled destroyers from the US that were needed for convoy escort. To that end it was vial that the US believe that Britain would continue the fight to the bitter end, and that the us would not be releasing the vessels only to have them attacking US commerce soon after. It would appear that the speech achieved all three objectives admirably. Looking further back, one is left to wonder if all of Henry V's St. Crispins' Day address to his troops was wholly Shakespeare, or if any was possibly original Henry. Update from Wikipedia on Prose: 

Frederick the Great famously noted after the Battle of Zorndorf that "It's easier to kill the Russians than to win over them." For that same battle the Russian commander (William Fermor) is noted as having drawn up his forces in front of a swamp, allegedly to deter his young conscripts from retreating away from Frederick's famous oblique attack. Other contemporary sources note the frequency with which Russian infantry was drawn up with Cossacks so close behind that "the breath of the horses warmed the hair on the back of their necks". Is there any consensus on the relative extent to which cultural, tactical, psychological and other factors contributed to the observed willingness of Russian soldiers to stand and die in exceptional numbers? The time period of interest would run from 1756 to 1815. 

Henry Knox's diary of the expedition (pages 16 - 19) mentions a cannon falling through the ice, apparently from inadequate precautions having been taken, and that it was recovered. As no mention is made in the diary of how the recovery was performed, it is possible that no written record remains of the precise technique. Myself, I would start by tying a slip knot and threading it over the back of the barrel and around the trunnions. Then use the oxen to pull it from the mud. However, one must remember that every New Year's Day, all across the continent, Polar Bear Swims are engaged in by folk from the very young to the very old. If one has the means at hand to get warm again promptly, then unlike Eble's Sappers and Engineers at the Battle of Berezina, 1813, there is absolutely no need for the experience to be mortal. I myself, as a youth, swam in water colder than 4 Celsius for 60 seconds, with no ill effects (and 12 beer better off). 

This makes use of the registration symbol highly recommended under U.S. law, but in many European jurisdictions failure to use the registration symbol is deemed to be an abandonment of the mark. A history of the development of the Trademark Act since the Lanham Act of 1946 (pp 56) notes that Section 43(a) of the Act protects both registered and unregistered trademarks (the latter "registered" as it were under common rather than statute law) and this was confirmed in Joshua Meier Co. v. Albany Novelty Manufacturing Co. (236 F.2d 144 (2d Cir. 1956)). My thinking is that this proof of protection subject to the defendant having actual notice of the claim of common law trademark protection, would have motivated much wider use of the ™ and ℠ symbols. 

Note that the announcement of Japanese surrender on Sep. 15 immediately resulted in a reallocation of resources away from additional bomb construction. The first priority immediately became "How fast can we get the boys back home and working civilian jobs again?". You must remember this when doing research, as this global change in strategic direction occurred literally overnight. Anyone interested in a worms-eye view of the vast undertaking that was Los Alamos, including some of the mathematical challenges associated with the Fat Man bomb design, will enjoy Richard Feynman's memoirs Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman - Adventures of a Curious Character. (or, as told to Ralph Leighton). 

However, I am unable to determine the extent to which these units were truly motorized. Typically they would have been assigned to Armoured Corps, where their extra mobility would be most useful. There were also three light division, designated respectively as Alpine (the 10th), (mule-)Pack (the 71st), and Truck (the 89th). The last appears to have been a fully motorized division, but deployed to Le Havre only on 21 January, 1945 and saw only relatively light action. It did participate in the overrun of Buchenwald on 4 April 1945. The remainder of U.S. Army infantry divisions, excepting mountain and airborne, were foot-transported. However, note that the mobility of a foot-transported divisions is more commonly limited by its logistics than by walking pace; in this all U.S. Army divisions were supplied with plentiful trucks for transport of headquarters units, artillery, supplies, and the rest of the tail. Where the German Army relied on horse-drawn logistical support for the entire war, most likely due to the extreme scarcity of valuable gasoline and diesel fuel, the Allied armies were much more mobile due to being able to relocate support troops, supplies and headquarters units forward much more quickly. This can be seen in the speed of the Allied advance across France after Avranches and Falais. In closing, recall the vast number of landing craft that the Allies, and particularly the U.S., employed throughout World War Two in both major theatres. These are, in essence, floating Armoured Personnel Carriers. The use of precious production capacity in their manufacture instead of simpler tracked APC's seems, to me, eminently reasonable. 

Given Al Qaida's status in 2001 as a de facto well sponsored arm of the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, I fail to see how anyone can see that particular act as anything but an act of war. Further, it seems clear that these act, by and of their nature, are deliberate acts of terror, and thus the attempt to split hairs between acts of terror between nations and acts of terror between nationally sponsored organizations pointless. 

In a board game it is difficult to simulate the command paralysis that gripped British, and even more severely French, high command following May 13. To a very real degree both British and French high command lost all track of troop locations for both sides for nearly a week. This was further exacerbated by the ill-timed replacement of Gamelin by Weygand. It is likely that German air is over-strengthed in these games, somewhat, as a means of simulating this command failure by the Allies. 

In Strategy, B. H. Liddell Hart notes that both the French and German High Commands had planned on an assault across the Meuse as not being possible until the 5th or 6th day, allowing both sides the time to bring up necessary artillery reserves. No explicit mention is made of air power. However, maximum air support by the Luftwaffe allowed Guderian to make the assault on the 2nd day, May 13, with Kleist's approval. This capability of substituting air power for slow heavy artillery reserves would become even more decisive as the leading Panzer divisions raced ahead following Sedan. Panzer III and IV tanks were mostly incapable of destroying the best British and French tanks, so Stuka dive-bombing support was repeatedly employed to do so instead. 

Following his return to my grandparents house my father then was required to stay in the attic for the next six months, until the liberation of Schiedam. A cubby hole was opened under the attic eave with a sliding panel. I had the opportunity to see this entire setup in 1969: a small space about 16" high by 7' long by 18" deep. 

1856 Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law, which Privateering 1864 Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field which codified the treatment of wounded in the field and the protection of medical personnel wearing the Red Cross. 

According to the Cursus Honorum, Tiberius was not eligible to be Consul until the age of 42. As he was killed at the age of only 30 (163/2 BC to 133 BC) he was a long cry from being eligible for the Consulship, even given the extreme bending of the rules that was becoming commonplace about this time. The Cursus Honorum was a succession of offices to be held by Consulship candidates, each one with a successively greater minimum age much as the minimum age to be a US Senator is 30. The minimum age to be a Praetor, the immediate prerequisite for the consulship, was 39, and was to be followed by a two-year term in the provinces as Propraetor before returning to Rome eligible to stand for the consulship. As great an honour as it was to even become Consul, those who like Cicero made it in their year were even more esteemed, as never having lost an election and stood for every office of the course at the earliest possible age. 

Update: As regards the claim that human hunting of large carnivores resulted in over-grazing by large herbivores: I find it an incredulous suggestion that that stone-age humans were preferentially hunting large carnivores in an eco-system in which large herbivores were numerous. Update #2: The desertification of the Sahara, by all accounts, certainly occurred at least 2,000 years prior to the Founding of Rome in 753 BC. 

The Catholic Encyclopedia contains a length article on the Catholic Military Orders as well as on specific orders such as the Teutonic Knights and the Knights Templar. Some key points from those articles are: 

In short, not at all. Part of the reason is that our modern concept of language, as a determinant of national identity, is a 19th century construct. Prior to the rise of nationalism, and publicly funded national school systems teaching a standard enunciation and spelling, every village in the world spoke its own dialect. For each such village the idiom, vocabulary and pronunciation would vary slightly from its neighbours, slowly drifting in steps of 10 to 15 miles or so from national capital to national capitol. Those which historians and archaelogists refer to as the languages of the Middle East, are merely the particular dialects written in each national capital. These national capital dialects, now hundreds of steps removed from each other, vary considerably from each other, enough so to be regarded as different languages rather than dialects. All of the languages you mention as of interest are Afro-Semitic languages, probably descended from a common language more recent to them than the time period is to us. Much as the modern Romance languages of Europe flow across the former territories of the Western Roman Empire, these Afro-Semitic languages likely flowed across the Middle East from Aswan to Baghdad. That being said, each court would have had interpreters trained in writing and speaking the idiom, vocabulary and pronunciation of national capitals. Before the invention of the printing press, and widely distributed language primers, such multi-lingual interpreters (ie scribes) would have been highly regarded and well paid professionals. 

Update: Further research finds that New Zealand adopted a colony-wide standard time, based on the longitude of 175.5 degrees East of Greenwich, on Nov. 2, 1868. 

This does not refer to a Pound Sterling, or British Pound, but rather to the colonial currency of North Carolina, the North Carolina Pound. This was the official currency of North Carolina until the establishment of the United States Dollar in 1792, as a replacement for the Continental Dollar, and is apparently still legal tender in North Carolina to this day. Note that while the said tax was denominated in North Carolina Pounds, the United States Dollar was legal tender throughout the United States and its territories from 1792, and would have been used to pay most transactions in the state from that date. Also, although the compilation of laws you referenced was enacted on Nov. 21, 1814, most if not all of this legislation would have been in place for decades preceding. It is customary practice for jurisdictions to recompile their statutes from time to time, but there is rarely any (intentional) change in the wording at these times.
