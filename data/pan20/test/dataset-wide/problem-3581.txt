There has been some more recent information that this activity level alone is not enough if you sit for prolonged hours. The suggestion is that you need to take regular activity breaks from sitting in addition to the above exercise recommendations to lower your risk of cardiometabolic disease. The idea of packing all your activity into the weekend would not be optimal. Doing so could also increase your risk of injury and not give you the health benefits of regular activity. It is best to schedule your routine into your daily life. The above guidelines are to improve your health. As your health and fitness level improves you will want to re-evaluate and adjust your activity level. 

Although weakness or limited mobility anywhere in the kinetic chain may lead to excessive pronation as a compensation, limited ankle dorsi-flexion is often a prime culprit. To test your dorsi-flexion range you can see if you can fully squat without lifting your heels or losing your balance. Or another quick lunge test uses a ruler and the wall. If you find limitation in ankle dorsi-flexion, here are some good exercises to stretch your muscles and mobilize the joint. Your short foot exercise video you linked to is good, as is towel pleating which will help you target toe flexors. (Sorry for the long winded video.) To specifically target your requested muscles you can use resistance bands: 

Psoas - To stretch the psoas the 1/2 kneel lunge position is a good stretch. Quads - The quads cross both the hip and knee joints. To stretch the quads you need to bend the knee and extend the hip to stretch both parts of the muscles. To be most effective in gaining range of motion, stretches are best done on a daily basis after warm-up or activity. 

Stress reduction techniques practiced when not under stress will help you be able to put those skills to use when you need them while under stress. Techniques often include relaxed breathing, visualization/guided imagery, or progressive relaxation where you sequentially tense muscles and then release them. Suggestions: 

While I can't give you the exact reason why your body has gained weight without any apparent changes in lifestyle other than prolonged sitting; I can confirm that prolonged sitting does create negative consequences in the body. All of the points you raise may contribute, but metabolic changes are probably the key. Consequences of Prolonged Sitting 

PFPS (patello-femoral pain syndrome) is usually caused by the knee cap tracking off to the lateral side instead of keeping centered in the femoral groove. The causes can be from muscle weakness (the VMO as you mentioned but also the glutes), tightness (muscle and fascia) esp. laterally, and/or faulty lower extremity alignment. If you haven't already consulted with a sports physical therapist or doctor, that would be a good place to start esp. if you haven't tried the McConnell taping mentioned below. To strengthen the VMO, first release any lateral muscle or hamstring tightness, and then make sure that you have good alignment while doing the exercises. Avoid pain as this will cause an inhibition of the VMO and negate your attempts to strengthen. • Muscle Weakness - The problem of VMO weakness as compared to the VL (vastus lateralis) is that it is not just a matter of weakness, but also of sequencing or timing of the muscle contraction. You want the VMO to kick in before the larger VL muscle contracts. If the VMO is delayed, the VL over-powers the smaller, weaker VMO causing the patella to track off to the lateral side. One training technique involves taping to control the tracking of the knee cap. (McConnell taping.) Then you can practice eccentrics ie step downs within a pain-free range. Pain needs to be controlled when attempting to strengthen the VMO because pain inhibits the muscle contraction. Strengthening of the VMO usually occurs in the latter degrees of knee extension, so you don't need to go into full flexion which places a greater strain on the patella. • Alignment - When doing VMO exercises, you need to look at the entire leg alignment including the foot and ankle. For instance, a foot that pronates (flattening the arch) causes a shift in the knee and patellar alignment. Foot orthotics may help relieve PFPS by improving foot alignment and controlling pronation. This video gives a good explanation about how to align your foot and tibia, and focus on the recruitment of the VMO and glutes in weight bearing or closed kinetic exercise such as your split squats. Muscle tightness may also contribute to poor knee and patellar alignment. • Tightness - Gently test the mobility of your knee cap. If it glides easily, especially medially (toward the inner thigh) then you are in good shape. However, often with PFPS the knee cap movement is restricted. Tight hamstrings and gastroc muscles behind the knee can cause a slight flexion at the knee which increases pressure on the patella and inhibits the function of the VMO. Self-massage to release the hamstrings, esp. the biceps femoris on the lateral side, can improve the function on of the VMO, so release tight muscles before strengthening the VMO. Lateral muscles that may need releasing are the lateral quads, TFL/IT band and glutes to allow for neutral alignment. The following exercises use a a foam roller to massage or release: 

Listen to @MEade, don't pull it. I had someone pull on my jammed finger because it was crooked. It turned out to be a bad fracture. Hope that isn't your case. I don't know if the pulling on it caused it to heal with a rotational deformity or if it was from the initial jam. However, despite ultimately having surgery, my finger is crooked when I make a fist. See a hand doctor if you need to see a doctor. In the meantime, yes follow RICE. Coban works nicely for a finger wrap because it sticks to itself and it is easy to wrap and re-wrap. I would first wrap the finger individually for the swelling and then wrap it to the adjacent finger for protection. (Not too tight - allow for swelling. Check the temp, sensation and color of your finger tip to make sure it is not too tight.) As far as splinting, I found that it was more trouble than helpful, as it would bump things and cause more pain. Elevate your hand higher than your heart to stop the throbbing. If you don't have a fracture you can start some gently motion as the swelling goes down. A contrast bath (alternating cold and warm water) is a nice way to do this. Good luck. 

And yes, do consider a good pair of supportive shoes and maybe even support socks. Also, if possible break up your walk with short sitting rest periods and do a few ankle circles. The good thing is that you have started a walking program that can add to your health and fitness. The bad thing is that you need to take care of the burning sensation before it gets worse and inhibits your progress. Good luck. 

This American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons info link gives a nice diagram and explanation of how the tendon gets stuck and then “triggers” as it gets unstuck. Because you have already injured your hands the safest way to resume strength training for your grip is to see a hand therapist. Hand therapy is a specialty of either physical or occupational therapy. They can test your grip and pinch strength with a dynamometer and tell you how to proceed given your condition. Here is some additional information that you can consider, but ask your hand therapist to direct you. 

Here is a link to Chi Running with a stroller articles. They recommend using a Stroll-Smart attachment to free your arms allowing for better form and upper body movement. If not using the attachment, here are some recommendations for a newbie chi runner with a stroller. @Ivo - Summary of links: Learning chi running with a stroller complicates the technique because the stroller interferes with your arm swing, limiting your upper body motion. The stroller adds resistance; and with something in front of you, it tends to inhibit the forward lean making you stand more upright. They recommend the stroll-smart adaptor, a bar that helps you push forward from your center rather than pushing forward with your arms. It gives you the freedom and form that you are looking for with chi running. If you are pushing a stroller without the stroll-smart adaptor, avoid tensing the arms and shoulders, and resist the tendency to stand more upright - use your core. You can switch off pushing arms. Continue the forward lean of the technique, keeping your legs relaxed. @David - One last point to your question about bending the elbows. My study of Tai Chi addresses alignments and opening the joints to allow for the unrestricted flow of chi, so bending the elbows to 90 degrees may be too acute of an angle (in my understanding). Also, you want a feeling of widening at the shoulders and underarms. Go for that relaxed feeling of being propelled forward. 

Calf Muscle Flexibility The important thing to remember about the calf and heel cord are that there are actually 2 muscles that need to be stretched, the gastrocnemius and the soleus. 

I would say that "movements in my head" and dizziness are not common responses. Check your breathing. Holding your breath, especially during exertion can spike your blood pressure. Making sure you continue to breathe may help. @Dave is correct that you should consult with your physician about your exercise program, especially if you have a medical condition such as high blood pressure. Your doctor will give you safe guidelines. When you go to your doctor, be prepared to explain your symptoms in response to your weightlifting and pushups. Ask specific questions regarding your workouts and what blood pressure readings are safe for you. This Mayo Clinic article gives some parameters for blood pressure readings and weightlifting. For example, they suggest: 

If you want to be able to climb long term, it is best to treat your symptoms sooner rather than later for best results. You can see by the picture you linked to that the finger pulley and tendon sheath system is complex and confined. Rest is important to allow a tendon or ligament to heal. You may need a splint for protection. The degree of injury can progress if you do not allow it time to heal. Once you have been cleared to return to climbing, get a professional to help you evaluate your technique to help prevent a recurrence. Progress very gradually. You may also need to use taping for protection. Good luck. Hope it turns out ok. 

As for proper running form (in shoes), there are different thoughts. If you land on your heel, you are probably landing with your leg too far out in front of you. This can cause a variety of injuries. Toe running is usually seen with sprinting, not longer distance running because the up and down motion will fatigue the calf muscles over time. Rather than landing on the toe or heel, you can land on your mid-foot, the ball of the foot or between the heel and mid-foot. This video describes the proper form as landing mid-foot with your foot directly beneath you. Generally, you land on the outside edge of your foot behind your little toe, and roll in to push off with your big toe (pronate). In your case, your orthotics control the amount of pronation so that you don’t roll in too far. This controls the alignment of your ankle, knee and hip. Since you are new to running and are pain-free with your orthotics, you may want to stay with the orthotics until you build up your running endurance. Then you can try some short distance barefoot walking to see how your joints respond. If and/or when you do try barefoot running, work up very gradually. 

Here is a ref. you may find very useful $URL$ The class I took taught us to use breathing to support a variety of postures. For example, in prone extension the back muscles begin to fatigue, but when you combine this with breathing into the posture, the muscles do less of the work allowing you to maintain the posture with less effort. The lessons take diaphragmatic breathing well beyond the basics. I'm sorry that I can't take the explanation farther than that, but I hope that gives you a start of where to look. 

Diet - Unless you get your diet under control, exercise alone will not make enough of a difference on its own. Craig Ballantyne does a great diet versus exercise video that will stick in your mind when you are considering calories going in and just how hard it is to work them off with exercise. The best resource for a specific diet for you is to meet with a registered dietician that specializes in obesity. This will save you a lot of wasted time trying to learn how to eat well, with proper portion sizes and with specific calorie amounts so that you have a viable eating and weight loss plan. Your doctor will be happy to set you up with a good dietician. With morbid obesity, you need a pro helping you handle your diet. And you will need to get away from fast foods as they generally have poor nutritive values and a lot sodium and artery clogging fats. Keeping Track - Discuss with your doctor the measurements that are most important for you to keep track of to measure your progress: Waist Circumference, BMI, Body Fat Percentage etc. Ask your doctor for advice on using a Heart Rate monitor and what your safe target heart rate is during exercise. Keep a chart or graph of your diet, exercise and progress to help motivate you when the going gets tough. Exercise - Finding the right exercise(s) for you is key to exercising successfully. Low or no impact exercises are easiest on the joints. Water aerobics, swimming, running in water, water resistance exercises etc. will allow you to get a good workout without as much strain. Stationary cycles, elliptical trainers and Nordic walking poles are also good options for delicate knees. Join a gym and set up a regular schedule that works for you. Meet with their trainer and have them set up a routine for you that includes resistance training as well as cardio and stretching. Then have them upgrade it periodically. Ask for a program that includes resistance training for large muscle groups. They can show you alternatives to the squat that are easier on your knees. You may need to use a machine and/or limit your range. For example, you can target your glutes with the hip extension machine and this won't affect your knees. Get Support - Losing the amount of weight that you want to lose involves a lifestyly change - increasing your overall activity and decreasing your sedentary time. Find a sport or physical activity that you enjoy. You will need support along the way. Enlist as many friends, family, trainers, work out buddies etc. as you can to help you stick with the program. You can also get support online. However, given just how important losing weight safely is to your health, it is wise to set up your plan with your own health professionals.
