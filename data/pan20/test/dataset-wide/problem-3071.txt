the "high middle ages" were a period of considerable social change and relocation of population groups. It was the growth of the cities and the establishment of a large merchant class that provided for the growth of religion. The farmer tilling his soil had better things to do than contemplate God, a merchant sitting at home at the end of a day after the ledgers are closed would have little else to do. 

I serioulsy doubt Japanese cavalry of the era was inferior to samurai. The idea of the invincible samurai who all alone with his katana can defeat entire armies is pure fiction. 

If they worked anything like the Mongols and other nomads that went imperial, they absorbed those they conquered, giving them a level of autonomy backed up with quick and brutal reprisals if they stepped so much as an inch out of line (and that could involve the sacking of cities, killing the entire adult population and selling the children into slavery in case of the Mongols). Do that a few times and an a population tends to get the message that they'd best do as they're told. Also give them a decent living by not overtaxing them, probably taxing them less than their previous overlords used to do, and you've made a population that isn't likely to rebel, in fact will police itself against rebellion. 

And as you said, being what they were they would have been very hard to fight effectively by the traditional means of Chinese armies (just as the field armies of the day in the middle east and Europe had no effective counter against the Mongol hordes until they themselves adopted large scale cavalry tactics, combined with firearms). 

If he never made his journey, there was no first hand knowledge to spread and all he did was get rich(er) and more (in)famous off of telling his story, which can't have hurt his business enterprise. 

In addition to Alex's excellent summary of how the USSR worked (which many European countries are getting very close to, e.g. in the Netherlands every voter is recorded, which may or may not be linked to his actual votes cast (in case of electronic voting, they certainly have the option but whether it's actually done is not known to me), people might well vote for local people, especially in local and regional elections, hoping their village/town candidate might be able to do something for them in the higher levels of the party bureaucracy eventually. 

As to foreign trade, there was not a lot of that anyway outside the Comecon and Warsaw pact, the wall had little or no effect on that. 

$URL$ shows a Dutch barracks built in 1764, expanded in 1878, and still in use today (plus several others from the same era, including interior photographs). 

German wikipedia mentions nothing of an Argentine project predating Leopard 1 development. The Indienpanzer project and its failure is mentioned briefly, together with a statement that at the time German industry was incapable of developing a modern MBT, that the failed India project gave German industry and especially Porsche the knowledge needed to make Leopard 1 work. I don't have my reference material here, but vaguely recall another abandoned German tank development project for a south American country from the 1980s, a cheaper, smaller, alternative to Leopard 2 (and a competitor to the AMX-40 which was being developed by the French for the export market). Maybe that's the one you're looking for? 

The GDR government was under a lot of pressure from Moscow to "do something" about the flood of their citizens fleeing to the west. That flood of refugees, most of them the brightest and best educated of the country, was also seriously affecting the economy at all levels. So putting a stop to it, in a command economy like the Soviet style system the GDR employed, was paramount. 

Removing all the shell casings and bullet casings and melting them down for the metals may seem like a profitable idea, but if you consider that they're spread rather thin over a very large area, the work involved is extremely expensive. And what with the land being owned by many people, just getting permission from all those owners is more than tedious. And of course after decades most of it will be buried, sometimes meters deep. 

You make the mistake of thinking the South Korean economy was as strong as it is today before around 1970. It wasn't. Effectively the country was still an agricultural economy no different from what it had been under Japanese occupation. In the 1960s the South Korean government started massive industrialisation projects, building factories, shipyards, airports, etc. etc. which caused the economy to boom. North Korea meanwhile was stagnant, as it had been since the end of the Korean war. To quote Wikipedia : 

I seriously doubt you can make any such generalisation. Case in point, Zimbadwe is one of the worst countries in the world, when under British rule it was affluent. It used to be the bread basket of Africa, now it's starving. And that has nothing to do with the fact that it was British before, and everything with the way it's being run now. And the same is true of everywhere else pretty much. Indonesia is doing rather well, despite the way the Japanese ripped everything that could be fit into a cargo ship from the country during WW2. OTOH despite being very rich in natural resources and having received massive aid over the decades, Cote d'Ivoire is dirt poor. 

$URL$ mentions a "supreme arbitration court", could be the position is the head of this unit, which seems to deal with economic affairs (of course in 1992 it's post-Soviet, but many of the Soviet era institutions are still in place with their names unchanged). 

They controlled the entire land mass they could control using the technology at their disposal (the island of Crete). Now think about how that would have come about, and what the consequences would be. Reasons for that are relatively simple: 

From what I read in his biography, if anything he did the opposite. He hated his father, hated the church. During his rule a lot of purges hit the Caucasus, including the complete removal of population groups to Siberia and replacing them with Russian natives. He rarely even went back there, only a few times to visit his ailing mother (whom he adored) after installing her in what amounted to a palatial home for her. 

No sources I could dig up give any indication of it being a uniformed position, or the holders of the office wearing a uniform of any kind (unless you'd consider the typical ill-fitting Soviet business suits to be a uniform, or the expensive Saville Row suits of the high ranking leaders who could plunder state coffers to have London tailors make suits for them). 

But do remember that there was very little communist influence in Europe left from the 1920s onward (and into the 1990s at least) that was not controlled by the USSR either directly or through proxies like Bulgaria. So the last paragraph doesn't really make much sense. Some of those groups may have thought they were not under Soviet control, but only if their controllers hid the identity of their benefactors and controllers from those groups, which might have happened in cases where the Soviets were less than certain about the loyalty of the group to the Soviet cause. 

You'd get to see thus the same variety as in any other type of building, but likely with a tendency towards larger blocky buildings, easily divided into similar sized rooms for use as quarters and offices, armouries and mess halls. 

Of German companies, no doubt many if not most supplied items that found their way into the bureacracies and organisations responsible. Therefore a list of German IT companies, filtered for date of establishment prior to 1945, would be a good start. For the others it's much harder as there's no doubt no records of export to Germany during the war left, those would long ago have been destroyed because they'd be too embarrassing for the countries and companies involved to retain. 

Each Axis power signed their own surrender documents. No doubt the protocol for each such meeting was different, with similarities (we're talking military operations here, there's bound to be a guide book on how to arrange such things somewhere in the military manuals of most nations). What happened to the signing parties would depend heavily on the terms of surrender. The Italians surrendered to the allies for example after they themselves overthrew Mussolini, which would have influenced the attitude of the present allied dignitaries towards them. The Japanese effectively did something similar, the emperor pretty much firing his war cabinet and reducing his status to a far more ceremonial monarch. I don't think any of them would be happy to take part in a victory party with their (now former) enemies and conquerors. I know I probably wouldn't be (except maybe in case of the Italians, who may well have sent people who had been in opposition to the Mussolini regime). 

Nuclear power stations are steam engines, they just use a different source of energy to generate the steam from what you're probably thinking of. So yes, steam engines are in widespread use around the planet. 

There are some cases of Jewish people with connections to influential Nazis getting special consideration, but that was not because of any veteran status per se (though some may have been) but because of personal friendships. I seriously doubt WW1 vets would be given any special status, irrespective of race or religion, in post-WW1 Germany. Germany lost that war, was degraded, and many (as is typical in history) blamed that loss on the military. As the military leaders were still in power, that meant the regular soldier took the blame. 

But what they didn't have was a big building full of sex slaves, gathered as loot during military campaigns and taken into their household in exchange for favours from foreign dignitaries. Such wouldn't do in Roman society where family values were held in great esteem (at least in public). 

In the Roman empire it was quite common to worship only a subset of all the myriad gods and goddesses on the menu (so to speak). At the same time every god or goddess that came knocking was accepted into the pantheon with open arms as long as (s)he was willing to accept the existence of all those other gods (many with overlapping powers and responsibilities). Over time gods would also merge, sometimes near identical gods from different areas would quickly become blended and merely be known by different names to different people (the blending of Greek and Roman gods is a prime example of this in action). The major except to this is Christianity, and then only because the god of Christianity explicitly states there is no other god, Christians were iow not willing to accept the existence of other gods (nobody would have forced them to worship those gods). This was both sacrilege and treason, rebellion against the state (as the state was closely linked with the religion at several levels). 

The two are not mutually exclusive. The "apeasement" had the purpose (and effect) to blunt and slow the military readiness of Germany's future enemies, while allowing Germany to build up its own armed forces to the levels needed for the upcoming campaigns. It also gave Germany, through diplomatic means, access to the industrial capability and natural resources of Austria and the Sudetenland, important for her war industry, without having to fire a shot (and especially in case of Austria with overwhelming support from the local population). It allowed Germany to pick and choose the moment to unleash the war it was seeking, was sure would be inevitable in the end, rather than have that moment dictated to them by outside forces. And having the treaty with the USSR ensured both that there'd be no second front until such a time as Germany chose there to be one (though in the end suspicions about possible Soviet buildup may have sped up the plans for operation Barbarossa) and Soviet support during Germany's build up, both in the form of supplies (Ukrainian grain and Russian steel) and logistics (many German troops were trained in the USSR, especially those that would fall foul of the Versaille restrictions). 

While the Roman emperors were no doubt a happy bunch, they certainly weren't homosexual. They had wives, children, extra-marital affairs (often to the horror of the court), concubines, the works. 

This according to "The Falklands War" by Martin Middlebrook, a military historian who's studied the whole affair in depth (as much as possible, the Argentinians still often don't want to talk to British people about it all). 

What about both? Australia was harsh, far away, hard to get away from. Perfect penal colony, if a tad big maybe. Originally it was no doubt intended as a place to dump convicts when the prisons at home were overflowing. As to your uncle, remember the penal system at the time was rather less lax of "petty crimes" than it is today. Theft was theft, no silly "it's only a candybar, let's let him go with a stern warning never to do it again" attitude of law enforcement. Usually though, for crimes like that you'd not be sentenced to be a transportee for a first offense. And while the cost of sending you over would be considerable, you were put to work there. As a result in the end you'd probably turn a profit for the Crown if you survived long enough. That work ended up building Australia (and areas of the Americas) so they became more hospitable to other colonists. Also, many times a transportee wasn't allowed to return home after his sentence was up, he'd become a trustee and lived in growing towns and villages around the prison compounds, working a hopefully honest job. Others were allowed to return home but you'd have to pay for the trip, which often meant you'd spend years or decades as a civilian in the colonies trying to save up enough to pay for the ticket. And by the time you had enough, quite possibly you were married with children, you had your entire life there and no reason to go back to the old country. As the colonies grew, so did the demand for cheap labour for the mines, farms, and public works. As this was largely provided by the prison camps, adding to the population of those was a logical thing to do, which meant deporting more people (and thus introducing transportation as a penalty for ever smaller crimes, and for ever longer periods). But that led to greater demand for guards, thus more colonists. France for a period had the same thing going in French Guyana and parts of Africa.
